00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.331
<v 0>So,</v>

2
00:00:00.331 --> 00:00:04.800
what you do is you create your own curriculum that is above and beyond what is

3
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:08.070
handed to you. And I think, you know, I think about what was handed to me,

4
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:12.000
education wise and how I kind of blew it. And I talk about that in the book,

5
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.190
there's a whole chapter on creating your own curriculum.

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.140
It was based on a tweet. This guy did,

7
00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:20.040
Frank Fleming said that if you actually took all the education time, 16,

8
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.450
like 16 years of education and kind of curated what you wanted to do,

9
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.160
you would be Batman 16 years of like martial arts,

10
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.260
philosophy languages you would be, or economics, you would be Batman,

11
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.150
but instead you have 16 years of education and you're applying for jobs,

12
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.630
you know, in pharmaceutical sales. And you're hoping you will get that job.

13
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.520
<v 2>It's got, look, you wrote a book, you wrote a book here.</v>

14
00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:58.100
This is what your 27th book. How many books now? Yeah.

15
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.900
<v 0>Yes. This is book number nine or blight. What I like to say?</v>

16
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.440
Yeah. I like to say it's eight more than yours. Dave.

17
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.150
Eight more books than yours. I can't even see your first book. It's so early.

18
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.540
It's like, call me when you're on your fifth book.

19
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.380
<v 2>Well,</v>

20
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.970
then I can get the patches on my elbows and the whole thing and be an esteemed.

21
00:01:19.971 --> 00:01:20.630
Right?

22
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.870
<v 0>Thank you. You'll be like Judd, Hirsch and ordinary people.</v>

23
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.880
<v 2>You are going into your sort of J D Salinger phase though of life.</v>

24
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:32.750
I can tell because you've got your house in the undisclosed location in the

25
00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:35.600
woods. You occasionally tweet pictures. You're on a Lake,

26
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.680
surrounded by trees and things. You're sort of going into that.

27
00:01:39.681 --> 00:01:41.930
You're thought of as a, as a cable news guy,

28
00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:45.560
but you're what really drives you is the desire to be off the grid,

29
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.600
hidden in the woods. True or false.

30
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.640
<v 0>I, I believe that I was self distancing before it was cool. I,</v>

31
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.840
um, I don't know what it was. It was because I was younger. I was more social,

32
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.530
but I have no desire. Like, you know, when you're in New York,

33
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.770
it is impossible to even get me out of my apartment. You know?

34
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.940
Literally you end up, yes. You come to my,

35
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.720
I made you come to my apartment when it was destroyed,

36
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.590
because I would rather sit in my apartment that had just been flooded that

37
00:02:15.591 --> 00:02:19.010
actually like, Oh, the is, go meet me at this restaurant. I go, you know,

38
00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:20.980
I don't really feel like, but I.

39
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.430
<v 2>I am. I'm like, I'm like Greg named the restaurant. It's on me,</v>

40
00:02:25.431 --> 00:02:28.670
whatever you want, you know, grass fed this. You're like,

41
00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:31.640
could you just come to my place? I have, I have one beer.

42
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.320
<v 0>Yes. I'm not that bad. I always have booze,</v>

43
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.820
but we did go to Del Frisco's. Remember we did that across the hall.

44
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.250
<v 2>Who was that? That was nice. Um.</v>

45
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.880
<v 0>Nice guy. Yeah. So it was your brother, right?</v>

46
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.640
That you told me that was your brother. Yeah. Okay.

47
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.970
<v 2>It was my brother. He says, he's my brother. I'm not sure.</v>

48
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.770
No, but let, let's talk about, uh, the, the quarantine stuff a little bit.

49
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.070
Cause, cause in your book, you actually, you,

50
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.680
I guess you added the preface after you wrote the whole thing,

51
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:04.990
because then you want it to address the quality and stuff and they,

52
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.310
they let you gamut it in there.

53
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.570
<v 0>Yeah, it was interesting because we had to have a discussion,</v>

54
00:03:09.571 --> 00:03:14.070
whether something in the news ends up branding your book or should your book be

55
00:03:14.071 --> 00:03:15.420
above it all. So I'm, I'm,

56
00:03:15.421 --> 00:03:18.870
I'm the book's going to bed and all this stuff is happening.

57
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.000
And the book itself is about a collective response to crap in your life so that

58
00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:26.310
we all share the risk and be better people.

59
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.430
And this thing is happening and I'm going, I have,

60
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.640
this has to go in the book because all of the things in the book,

61
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.450
the collective response prison to two ideas, unbending minds, uh,

62
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.690
blaming and forgiveness, all fit.

63
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.950
You could all point all of these tips in that direction. And um,

64
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.540
but there was like, there were people going leaking. Yeah.

65
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.060
But you don't want to be a pandemic book. And I go, well, you know what,

66
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.380
if this book had come out in 2016, we would be talking about the Trump election.

67
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.160
If it'd been coming out in 12 2012, it would be Obama, you know, or,

68
00:03:56.161 --> 00:03:58.740
or if it came out in 2001, it would be nine 11.

69
00:03:58.741 --> 00:04:02.070
So you can't ignore reality.

70
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.060
So I put it in there and it in, in, um, it's weird a lot,

71
00:04:06.061 --> 00:04:08.820
all the chapters in this book are details are,

72
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.980
are dealing with crap that happened later.

73
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.210
Like even the riots in the oldest looks, I talk about social media.

74
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.080
I talk about, uh, uh, marginalization, demonization, all this stuff.

75
00:04:19.081 --> 00:04:22.470
And it's like, everything is happening. And it makes, I, I it's,

76
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.110
it kind of scares me because I'm trying to be positive.

77
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.790
And the book is trying to be positive,

78
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.720
but we're in a time where we're not sure if we can be positive anymore,

79
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.060
you know? No.

80
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.790
<v 2>Well, nobody's, nobody's sure of anything, but I will go on the record.</v>

81
00:04:35.791 --> 00:04:39.990
Gutfeld is saying that if anyone watching this enjoy don't burn this book,

82
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.890
they will dig the plus because actually a lot of, a lot of the themes, I mean,

83
00:04:43.891 --> 00:04:46.110
this is why we do so much stuff together lately.

84
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.890
A lot of the themes that both of us care about related to free speech,

85
00:04:49.891 --> 00:04:51.270
what's happening at the colleges,

86
00:04:51.271 --> 00:04:55.440
trying to keep some semblance of Western society, organized,

87
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.300
maintaining a sense of humor through it,

88
00:04:57.301 --> 00:05:01.200
all that that really is what the thrust of this is about. But on the,

89
00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:02.490
on the self-help side,

90
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.270
do you sense that people over the last four months that there's going to be

91
00:05:06.271 --> 00:05:10.260
like, when, when this thing is done, if it's, if it's ever done that,

92
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.780
that there will be a real split where it'll be like,

93
00:05:12.781 --> 00:05:16.620
some people really will have gotten their lives in order and lost weight,

94
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.220
how to cook, started new hobbies, et cetera, et cetera.

95
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.490
And then there will be this other set of people that will just like completely

96
00:05:23.491 --> 00:05:24.990
lost control of their lives.

97
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.160
<v 0>And I know both sides of that, of that equation.</v>

98
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.270
It's kind of like the it's like the education argument that like you could just

99
00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:36.300
go to high school, check in and check out and you'd come out worse.

100
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.230
Or you can be that kid that goes, Oh, I want to do this. I want to go,

101
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.060
I'm going to, I'm going to be like the Dana Perino,

102
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.030
I'm going to join the speech and debate club because that's going to make me

103
00:05:45.031 --> 00:05:48.630
better and I'm going to, and then I'm going to go play bad, uh,

104
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.680
with field hockey. I'm trying to think of sports, but I mean, it's like,

105
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.320
it's like lacrosse create lacrosse. Thank you.

106
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.990
So what you do is you create your curriculum that is above and beyond what, uh,

107
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.500
is handed to you. And I think, you know, I think about what was handed to me,

108
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.430
education wise and how I kind of blew it. And I talk about that in the book,

109
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:09.620
there's a whole chapter on creating your own curriculum.

110
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.570
It was based on a tweet. This guy did,

111
00:06:11.571 --> 00:06:15.470
Frank Fleming said that if you actually took all the education time, 16,

112
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.880
like 16 years of education and kind of curated what you wanted to do,

113
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:24.590
you would be Batman 16 years of like martial arts

114
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.690
philosophy languages you would be, or economics, you would be Batman,

115
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.580
but instead you have 16 years of education and you're applying for jobs,

116
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.470
you know, in pharmaceutical sales.

117
00:06:36.471 --> 00:06:40.610
And you're hoping you will get that job because you did not think about it.

118
00:06:40.611 --> 00:06:42.860
Like what an incredible opportunity.

119
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.860
So that's how I started thinking about the pandemic is like, okay,

120
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.370
the cards that are being dealt are limiting everything.

121
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.970
Like I can't go to the gym, which I've been going for 40 years, I guess,

122
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.850
to the gym, like every week for 40 years.

123
00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.530
And that's over and I know how much I eat. I eat a buttload of food,

124
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.770
so this is not going to end well for me also, I tend to, you know,

125
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.220
I like drinking and I'm going to be home a lot. And there's also,

126
00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:10.430
all of these variables are pointing in a terrible direction for me.

127
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:11.713
And I thought, well,

128
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.160
what if I decided to create like a S a S quote,

129
00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:19.430
Scott Adams, uh, system, uh, rather than goals.

130
00:07:19.431 --> 00:07:23.900
And so I like cut out the, get cut out the, the starches and the,

131
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.540
and the carbohydrates. And then, and then it's like,

132
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.440
get a bike and get up every morning and start early. And then,

133
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.730
and also why I get up every morning and walk before I exercise.

134
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:38.150
And I just to get sunlight, all this stuff. And all of a sudden, it just like,

135
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.460
it made me, I it's like I, I took,

136
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.970
I went to school to become a better person,

137
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.120
which was weird because that's what the books about the book was about becoming

138
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:48.950
better at being you.

139
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.780
<v 2>It's kind of interesting. Well, it's interesting because.</v>

140
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.370
<v 0>You become a better Dave Rubin.</v>

141
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.120
<v 2>Well, I mean, I've, I've done it. You know what I mean?</v>

142
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.570
What you're going through right now is where I was a year ago.

143
00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:05.140
You'll get to the perfect place Greg, come on and I'm going to help.

144
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.420
I'm going to help you get there. Um, but it's, it,

145
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:10.480
it is kind of interesting because you wrote the book,

146
00:08:10.481 --> 00:08:13.930
obviously before the pandemic, then you add this part about the pandemic,

147
00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:14.290
but yeah.

148
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.310
What you were writing about and sort of getting your life together really kind

149
00:08:18.311 --> 00:08:22.150
of is what you're trying to show for other people. But that kind of reminds me,

150
00:08:22.151 --> 00:08:25.270
you wrote a piece on Fox news.com about a year ago,

151
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:30.280
about how people can educate themselves outside the

152
00:08:30.281 --> 00:08:32.740
system. You can learn from Jordan Peterson,

153
00:08:32.741 --> 00:08:37.390
you can go on YouTube and learn from biologists and chemists and all of those

154
00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:42.160
things. Does that strike you? The fact that young people still,

155
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.920
even now, as we watch colleges collapse,

156
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.180
does it seem just completely crazy to you that they're still putting all that

157
00:08:49.181 --> 00:08:50.770
money in on that experiment?

158
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.110
<v 0>There needs to be okay. Okay.</v>

159
00:08:53.111 --> 00:08:55.740
So there's that old experiment that we see failing,

160
00:08:55.890 --> 00:09:00.420
and it looks like the pandemic is going to push it online and elsewhere.

161
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.010
And then here is the perfect thing,

162
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:06.420
which is to have no shows like yours or YouTube,

163
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.201
anything on YouTube,

164
00:09:07.201 --> 00:09:11.310
like you getting a biology class from Bret Weinstein or getting a philosophy

165
00:09:11.311 --> 00:09:12.180
class with Jordan Peterson.

166
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.570
But th th the PR the instructors have to be really good.

167
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.690
It can't just be like YouTube where you're like, I get,

168
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:23.100
I get stuck in a YouTube black hole looking for, um, guitar instruction.

169
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:26.520
And so it's like how to play rockabilly guitar. So I hit that.

170
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.520
It's 30 minutes and the guides talking for eight minutes and it's like any,

171
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.270
he's just talking and he's holding his guitar. And it's like, I can't do this.

172
00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.940
I need like somebody who's an instructor.

173
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.700
And I think that's the only missing point. Cause you have the,

174
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.710
you have the vehicle, you have YouTube,

175
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.370
you've got the internet and you have the desire, the people to want to do this.

176
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:47.190
You have the pandemic that is forcing people in this direction.

177
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.450
All that's missing is the PR the stylistic

178
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.340
charismatic instructor.

179
00:09:53.341 --> 00:09:58.200
And I go back to Peloton every time pellet would Peloton did to gyms

180
00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.350
is what instructors are going to do to college.

181
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.810
So I no longer need to go to a gym again,

182
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.780
because the Peloton instructor is so amazing,

183
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.620
so smart and so authentic. And,

184
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.770
and I love this girl, Hannah Frankston, she's British.

185
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.620
I get up every morning and she gets me on that bike. And she,

186
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:20.940
she and I it's what she's done is she's taken the product and she's

187
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.670
delivered it to you in the best way possible.

188
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:28.350
That's the way there has to be colleges that start up with that model that says,

189
00:10:28.351 --> 00:10:33.060
okay, you need great professors. And they gotta be funny. They gotta be smart.

190
00:10:33.061 --> 00:10:36.840
They gotta be not bad. Looking. Everybody in Peloton is great looking.

191
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.880
And they're funny. And, and, uh,

192
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:42.330
and so I think that's the Peloton model for education is going to be the

193
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:46.430
solution for all of this. And I'm not thinking, I think that Scott Adams talked,

194
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.600
he said this to me before in an interview that it's like,

195
00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:53.010
this is the step that's necessary is to get likable, talented,

196
00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:56.190
persuasive people, to be the instructor.

197
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.100
And so now you're going to get those people leaving these colleges,

198
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.670
but there has to be something to come to and it's gotta be like Jordan Peterson

199
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:07.110
teaches, uh, introduction to, uh, apologetics or.

200
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:07.880
<v 2>Or whatever.</v>

201
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.180
