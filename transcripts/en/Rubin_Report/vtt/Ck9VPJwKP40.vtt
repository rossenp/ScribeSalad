00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.060
<v 0>If I had been doing it for the money was a grifter.</v>

2
00:00:03.061 --> 00:00:07.980
And I remember this moment when I became aware that my thoughts and opinions

3
00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:12.180
were different than most of my peers. And I was like,

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.900
Oh, I need to make a choice.

5
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:19.440
I either need to just be honest or I can,

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.260
I'm smart enough to be able to just pair it,

7
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:25.410
the talking points and be like dirt Porter. You know,

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.110
Trump is prefer and they say that over a million

9
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:35.520
retweets, just that would be grifting from, for me,

10
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:36.570
that would be a Griff.

11
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.630
<v 1>This is the Rubin report. And according to the deep state, I'm Dave Rubin,</v>

12
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.020
a quick reminder guys, subscribe to our YouTube channel,

13
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.010
which gives you just a teeny tiny chance of actually seeing our videos.

14
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.590
All right, then joining me today is a writer,

15
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.060
a comedian and host of the dumpster fire right here on YouTube.

16
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.250
Bridget. Fetisi welcome back to the Rubin report. All right,

17
00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:09.230
lady. You're back. Last time I had you on here, you were at the,

18
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.010
uh, the beginning of your political evolution.

19
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.220
You were saying, I don't know what's going on with this world.

20
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.450
You were trying to make some sense of the world. I still have no idea. Well,

21
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.000
a year later or whatever, it's been barely.

22
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.130
<v 0>A year, barely a year.</v>

23
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.720
<v 1>You're one of a, you know,</v>

24
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.900
you're on the shortlist of people that make some sense to me. So, uh,

25
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.070
what does that say about me?

26
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.050
<v 0>Hey, that's terrifying. People say this to me and I'm like,</v>

27
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.380
you know, that, that the world has gone crazy.

28
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.640
I've somehow I'm a voice of reason. And I get a lot of,

29
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.530
so I guess what's happened is it's true. It has been kind of an exponential,

30
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.720
I guess, um, just from like a statistical point of view and numbers,

31
00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:58.580
point of view on something like Twitter, it has been exponential rise or growth.

32
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.750
And with that comes a lot of criticism

33
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.160
and different criticism, mean things to you.

34
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.920
I know it's strange. I know that this doesn't affect other people,

35
00:02:12.921 --> 00:02:16.340
but it really seems to me predict no,

36
00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:20.810
but I feel like the criticism I get all the time is I'm a grifter, you know,

37
00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:23.900
like I'm some, like I was one way,

38
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.130
and then now I'm another way grifting, but they're like, you know,

39
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.540
eventually you're going to need to knock off this, both sides, routine yards,

40
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.590
because you're always trying to just, I'm like, I'm just being me though.

41
00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:38.900
I'm really confused.

42
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.300
<v 1>Do you think that that's sort of,</v>

43
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:45.560
what's working for you more than anything else? Like there's an there, well,

44
00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:49.460
there's just an upfrontness about your evolution. Like for me,

45
00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:53.480
something like five years ago, I just started saying, ah, guys, I'm a liberal,

46
00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:56.150
but something ain't right around here. And then it was just,

47
00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:58.310
people started going, Oh, me too. And I,

48
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.690
I sense sorta like just constantly in that thing

49
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.550
was like, Hey, my pleasure. Thank you.

50
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.440
<v 0>But I think the difference between, um,</v>

51
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.970
us is that you are already kind of in the political world.

52
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.540
And what was your degree in political science. Okay. So yeah.

53
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.540
<v 1>I'm one of three people that ever used a political science degree.</v>

54
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.050
<v 0>You went to college. I dropped out. So.</v>

55
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.940
<v 1>I was, yeah, but.</v>

56
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.110
<v 0>I was blacked out and smoking a lot of pot and waitressing.</v>

57
00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:33.810
And I say this to people a lot that I, I, you know,

58
00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:37.110
I talked about the factory settings and how I think when you're just,

59
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.400
when you have your head down and I didn't know until maybe, uh,

60
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.200
maybe last February,

61
00:03:43.201 --> 00:03:47.430
how I was going to pay more than two months worth of bills ever since when I was

62
00:03:47.431 --> 00:03:51.720
17. So when you have your head down, just trying to figure that stuff out,

63
00:03:51.721 --> 00:03:55.560
you're not really paying attention to the anything else. Yeah.

64
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.220
I was just trying to make money and wait tables and I moved to LA so that I

65
00:03:59.221 --> 00:04:03.690
could be a content creator. I wanted to write television shows and do comedy.

66
00:04:03.691 --> 00:04:06.030
And I didn't, I was never,

67
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.000
I was not aware there was a culture war going on,

68
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:13.200
which sounds completely naive of me. And Michael malice has said to me,

69
00:04:13.201 --> 00:04:16.140
you know, that just goes to show you how, how,

70
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.180
how entrenched the cathedral is in terms of media and

71
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.380
entertainment and academia is that I didn't even know I was in the cathedral.

72
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.840
<v 1>Right. Do you sense that, uh,</v>

73
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.280
getting the criticism of grifter or somehow you're doing this for money,

74
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.061
even though, as you said,

75
00:04:33.061 --> 00:04:36.210
it's just literally a year and a half ago or you're like, you know,

76
00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:38.480
scrounging around and all that. And also, you know,

77
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.360
it's also funny cause people think just because like we're on YouTube and we

78
00:04:42.361 --> 00:04:45.990
have a little powder on our faces that we're like rolling in dough and it's

79
00:04:45.991 --> 00:04:49.680
like, I'm not complaining by any stretch. And it was a long time to get here.

80
00:04:49.681 --> 00:04:50.550
You know what I mean? I want it.

81
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.250
And I'm just somewhere on my journey as you are. Um,

82
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.170
but I find that this thing of like,

83
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.110
cause a lot of people in our space now get thrown with grifter or you're doing

84
00:04:58.111 --> 00:05:00.840
it for the money or you're a seller or something like that. And in a weird way,

85
00:05:00.841 --> 00:05:03.060
while that used to bother me, now it's becoming, you know,

86
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.120
in some ways it's the ultimate compliment because it's almost like they have

87
00:05:06.121 --> 00:05:07.110
nothing left.

88
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.250
Like there's nothing left about the ideas that you put forth or the positions

89
00:05:11.251 --> 00:05:15.270
that you hold because you actually hold a lot of mixed bag of sort of left right

90
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:16.950
positions, which I think most people would do.

91
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.270
All they got is actually she's doing it for the money as in money as if you were

92
00:05:21.271 --> 00:05:24.510
like, Oh, if I just stuck out that position over there, you know,

93
00:05:24.511 --> 00:05:25.530
that's where the money rules.

94
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.530
<v 0>Had been doing it for the money and was a grifter.</v>

95
00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:33.450
And I remember this moment when I became aware that my thoughts and opinions

96
00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:37.680
were different than most of my peers. And I was like,

97
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.400
Oh, I need to make a choice.

98
00:05:41.401 --> 00:05:44.940
I either need to just be honest or I can,

99
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.750
I'm smart enough to be able to just pair it,

100
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.820
the talking points and be like director, you know.

101
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.160
<v 1>That's hilarious when they say that over and over tweets, just.</v>

102
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.350
<v 0>That would be grifting from, for me, that would be a grift because for,</v>

103
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.250
I, my idea of a grift is that I'm not being, I'm being disingenuous.

104
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:10.910
I'm being dishonest. I'm saying that I have one thing and I'm selling another,

105
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:15.350
but I'm selling my, if I'm selling anything, it's my confusion.

106
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.190
<v 1>Wouldn't a grift. Also be that you would,</v>

107
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.540
you would take the easier way out like you would like clearly I think,

108
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.940
I think the people that are in the space that we're in,

109
00:06:24.941 --> 00:06:28.480
whatever you want to call that, like this is the road less traveled. Right?

110
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.240
But like, if you're on the grift, you don't do the hard thing.

111
00:06:31.241 --> 00:06:32.340
You do the easy thing.

112
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.890
<v 0>Yeah. It would be easy for me to go in either direction, all in.</v>

113
00:06:35.891 --> 00:06:40.390
And it would also be easy for me to completely just de defect and be like,

114
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.433
I'm Mackinac.

115
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.970
<v 1>And I've.</v>

116
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.440
<v 0>Always joked that there are these two strains of Trump derangement syndrome and</v>

117
00:06:47.441 --> 00:06:52.210
I can quit like pretty quickly tell if somebody has one or the

118
00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:56.530
other it's if everything is Trump's fault or Trump can do no wrong and it's

119
00:06:56.531 --> 00:06:59.860
Magen resistance. So it's like the hashtags and they are,

120
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.540
and I feel like most people exist in the gray area in between,

121
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.560
but they, they get so bombarded by both sides,

122
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.100
if they dare to be like, well, I think there might be, you know,

123
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.790
I can see this from both sides or there might be a perspective here that they

124
00:07:15.791 --> 00:07:18.100
just are like, nah, I'm not, I'm just going to be quiet.

125
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.170
<v 1>So speaking of that, it's a good reason to have you on now,</v>

126
00:07:20.171 --> 00:07:23.770
because I know you're an expert in foreign policy, especially,

127
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.760
especially related to Iran, right? That's your specific expertise.

128
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:30.333
<v 0>Here?</v>

129
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:31.990
<v 1>No, that obviously is not true,</v>

130
00:07:31.991 --> 00:07:35.470
but actually often in the morning when I wake up and I have in my coffee and I'm

131
00:07:35.471 --> 00:07:38.500
just sort of like slowly getting online and I'm trying to get my thoughts

132
00:07:38.501 --> 00:07:41.260
centered, I'll shoot you some tax and we'll go back and forth a little bit.

133
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.290
And one of the things over the last couple of weeks that like consistently comes

134
00:07:44.291 --> 00:07:48.760
up is like the craziness related to every single

135
00:07:48.761 --> 00:07:52.270
person on Twitter. But I don't want to make this just about Twitter,

136
00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:57.040
but like the need for all the celebrities, all of the journalists, you know,

137
00:07:57.041 --> 00:07:57.910
air quote, journalists,

138
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:03.340
and just everybody to have to have a opinion on everything at

139
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.280
all times. Remember, I mean, just a couple of weeks, just a couple weeks ago,

140
00:08:06.281 --> 00:08:10.750
we were in world war II, world war three, go for you.

141
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.460
I walked my dog.

142
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:17.920
<v 0>That's the crazy thing. And, and we kind of talked about this on dumpster fire,</v>

143
00:08:17.921 --> 00:08:21.850
my YouTube show, which just makes fun of my whole thing with dumpster fires.

144
00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:25.900
Like we just want to laugh while the world burns because in the moment when news

145
00:08:25.901 --> 00:08:30.370
is breaking and having it is diplomacy by Twitter now, so there,

146
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.920
there is serious, you know,

147
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.430
are there's news breaking the president's tweeting, uh,

148
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:41.080
a flag then that the ambassador to the Supreme leader is tweeting.

149
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.520
They're flat. These are, I mean, my roommate, Samantha said it perfectly.

150
00:08:45.521 --> 00:08:48.310
She said, it's Ender's game meets risk redder.

151
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:50.583
<v 1>It's like.</v>

152
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:54.190
<v 0>Perfect description. And I think that there,</v>

153
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.960
so there is this real people are getting hurt. People are affected by this.

154
00:08:57.961 --> 00:08:59.910
It's all playing out virtually.

155
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.200
And then you close your computer or put your phone down and walk outside.

156
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:07.470
And it's like, dude, they didn't do to do nothing's going on.

157
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.850
And the majority of people have no idea. They're not like living in that.

158
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.270
But if you're in that moment and the news cycle is it's all breaking and

159
00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:18.540
everybody's got their takes and the journalists are all trying to figure it out.

160
00:09:18.541 --> 00:09:23.010
And they're waiting for the Pentagon to confirm things so that they can confirm

161
00:09:23.011 --> 00:09:26.550
the rumors. They're heard it. You get that kind of rush.

162
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:31.700
<v 1>Can you make of these people that literally something happens now and then</v>

163
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:36.530
they have the exact opposite reaction because it was another administration five

164
00:09:36.531 --> 00:09:37.130
years ago.

165
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.190
I'm not talking about somebody that's evolved over time with their political

166
00:09:40.191 --> 00:09:44.330
ideas. I'm talking about while Trump didn't have congressional authorization.

167
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.100
And then there's literally five years ago,

168
00:09:46.101 --> 00:09:48.890
their tweet when they were completely for Libya. I mean,

169
00:09:48.891 --> 00:09:51.200
Nancy Pelosi is a great example. Trump didn't need,

170
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:55.040
I don't even mean just the people in politics, but there's a video right now.

171
00:09:55.041 --> 00:09:59.000
That's been going around that I've shared of Pelosi five years ago or whatever

172
00:09:59.001 --> 00:10:03.230
it is six years ago saying Trump didn't or Obama didn't need congressional

173
00:10:03.231 --> 00:10:07.460
authorization. We toppled the maybe in regime and Kadafi now he needs it. Like,

174
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.570
but then everyone just flips on every little thing because it's all,

175
00:10:11.571 --> 00:10:12.404
it's all sports.

176
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.800
