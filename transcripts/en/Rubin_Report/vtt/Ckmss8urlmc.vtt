00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>The CDC has put out guidelines for celebrating Thanksgiving safely among the</v>

2
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:08.490
recommendations, enjoy your feast outside. And if you're hosting,

3
00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:11.940
tell guests to bring their own food and forks the CDC,

4
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:14.130
putting out a sketch of what that might look like.

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.490
A bunch of people bundle up in the cold, huddled around a fire,

6
00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:20.010
all wearing masks and standing far apart,

7
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:24.360
hardly the image that usually comes to mind for a happy Thanksgiving.

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.780
Dave Rubin is the host of the Rubin report. Dave, good to see you.

9
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:31.350
I want to put the rest of those CDC guidelines up on the screen because they're

10
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:35.610
worth looking at it says, bring your own food drinks, plates, cups,

11
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:36.444
and utensils,

12
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.130
wear a mask and safely store your mask while eating and drinking avoid going in

13
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:43.890
and out of the areas where food is being prepared.

14
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.960
Use single use options and disposable items like condiment packets and

15
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:52.800
plates. Your thoughts on three families showing up with three turkeys.

16
00:00:52.801 --> 00:00:53.790
In some cases, Dave.

17
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.890
<v 1>You know, Thanksgiving, which is literally the most American holiday there is,</v>

18
00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:03.950
which is about being thankful for the freedom that we have.

19
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.960
And all of the goodness that this country has given to us is about

20
00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:10.280
exercising your freedom.

21
00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:15.110
That's the purpose of the holiday and the idea that the CDC wants people that

22
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.530
you're living in the Northeast in the winter to stand outside and you should

23
00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:23.270
have masks inside and people are bringing their own cutlery and utensils and all

24
00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:25.880
of these things. First off, they know that virtually no one's going to do it,

25
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.040
but it's sort of this ever encroaching move to see what they can force

26
00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:34.340
us, or at least trick us into doing in our own homes,

27
00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:37.040
which in many ways is the most anti-American thing possible.

28
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.490
That's not to diminish COVID, but COVID is a,

29
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.590
a disease with a 97 to 99.5% recovery rate.

30
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.470
And now we have these vaccines that are going to say, you know,

31
00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:52.550
that are going to take care of 95% of people on top of that. So, you know,

32
00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:53.211
in this case,

33
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:56.960
I'm one of the people that's just more on the freedom side of this.

34
00:01:56.961 --> 00:01:58.670
You should do what you think is right.

35
00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:02.600
But I guarantee you that Whitmer the governor of Michigan and Newsome my

36
00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:05.240
governor here in California and Cuomo in New York,

37
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.990
they ain't going to be doing any of these things at their parties.

38
00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:10.130
I guarantee you, they won't.

39
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.620
<v 0>No some might be at the French laundry. You know,</v>

40
00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:14.660
you talk about the weather being called to the Northeast.

41
00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:17.480
I think it's 39 degrees is the high there today, Dave, and you know,

42
00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:20.180
it's interesting because some of the regulations we put up on the screen from

43
00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:24.170
the CDC are even tougher in New York state by, uh, governor Cuomo.

44
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.420
And one of the sheriffs in Fulton County,

45
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.150
New York had this to say about enforcement watch.

46
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.380
<v 2>In this particular case, when we go into somebody, when,</v>

47
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.560
when you try to authorize by executive order that we can come into someone's

48
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.400
house, count the people and take some sort of action that,

49
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.030
that remedy is greater than the wrong having people gathered.

50
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.210
<v 0>Yeah. Remedy greater than the wrong, your thoughts.</v>

51
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.310
<v 1>God bless that guy. That is absolutely right. And by the way,</v>

52
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.110
that's the way we fight back against these authoritarian rules is by

53
00:02:57.111 --> 00:02:58.700
good people who are in law,

54
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.210
private citizens just saying enough is enough just because the powers that be

55
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.020
tell us, we can't have family in our homes during Thanksgiving.

56
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:12.040
And we have to do all of these things doesn't mean that they have some God-given

57
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:16.150
right to, to make it be. And when, when we step up and say, Hey,

58
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:18.550
we'll take care of our families accordingly.

59
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.520
And if you're a store owner and you want to say, Hey,

60
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:25.060
you have to have a mask in my store, but you can do what you want outside.

61
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.360
That's called personal responsibility. That's the,

62
00:03:27.361 --> 00:03:29.260
that's the building block of America,

63
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.190
which again is exactly what we're supposed to be celebrating on Thanksgiving.

64
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.270
<v 0>You know what I found fascinating as the wall street journal had a story</v>

65
00:03:36.271 --> 00:03:39.390
yesterday talking about the fact that we still don't know where people are

66
00:03:39.391 --> 00:03:41.700
getting sick 5%, maybe from restaurants,

67
00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:44.610
10% from travel up to 50 to 75%.

68
00:03:44.611 --> 00:03:47.790
They have no idea how people are getting the disease.

69
00:03:47.791 --> 00:03:51.150
And yet we have all these various mandates that are just kind of throwing

70
00:03:51.151 --> 00:03:53.070
spaghetti against the wall. Your final thoughts, Dave.

71
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.820
<v 1>Yeah. Well, that's an absolutely great point.</v>

72
00:03:56.821 --> 00:03:59.580
What a responsible government would be doing is saying, Hey,

73
00:03:59.581 --> 00:04:04.350
when we've done these specific things, then we see certain numbers change,

74
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.720
but we don't really see that. They basically just say, Oh,

75
00:04:06.721 --> 00:04:09.960
we go from one crisis in one set of rules to another crisis.

76
00:04:09.961 --> 00:04:12.390
Let's not forget March two weeks to flatten the curve.

77
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.870
And we're basically at the end of 2020 right now that's nine months.

78
00:04:15.871 --> 00:04:19.350
And the sense they are going to let this thing end, it doesn't seem like it.

79
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.780
<v 0>Yeah. Final note, we should, you know, Florida is,</v>

80
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.020
has none of these mandates or very few of these mandates and they're not doing

81
00:04:25.021 --> 00:04:28.320
well as far as COVID goes, but Illinois, Wisconsin, uh,

82
00:04:28.321 --> 00:04:31.680
other States that have severe mandates, you know, doing worse than Florida,

83
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.170
Dave Rubin, it's always good to see you. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.
