00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.020
<v 1>And wild Los Angeles County says it may extend it.</v>

2
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.760
Stay at home orders for three months. Beaches in the area did open this weekend.

3
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.080
Joining me now is Dave Rubin hosted the Rubin report author of don't burn this

4
00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:24.950
book, father of Clyde, and a good friend of the show. So, Dave, um,

5
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.740
I know that you've been very frustrated in California.

6
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.970
I want you to listen to this because I can't imagine how these graduating

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.380
seniors felt when they heard how their drive-thru

8
00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:39.080
graduation idea was going to be squashed. Watch.

9
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.940
<v 0>I think it's unfortunate that this is happening during the pandemic,</v>

10
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.840
because we are asking that all graduations be virtual,

11
00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:52.640
only our health officer order prohibits, uh, as a state,

12
00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:54.920
any events from happening. Um,

13
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:59.540
and even those sort of car drive in graduations that folks would like to have

14
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.670
are considered events. So for right now, there can be nothing, uh,

15
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.070
except the virtual graduation.

16
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.360
<v 1>All right. Dave Rubin take it away.</v>

17
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.470
<v 2>Yeah. Well, Dana, look, you know,</v>

18
00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:20.420
I'm a simple guy and I thought that we voted in elected officials and people

19
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.370
in power so that they could make complex decisions and then explain

20
00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:28.790
those complex decisions for us. And that way society could flourish.

21
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.690
But what we seem to have a particularly bad case of unfortunately,

22
00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:36.530
in my state of California and really particularly in my city of Los Angeles,

23
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.430
is that authorities seemed to think that because they just say something that,

24
00:01:40.431 --> 00:01:45.080
that in and of itself makes it right or true or worthy of being a policy.

25
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:47.360
And it's like, nobody explains anything. And,

26
00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:51.620
and they seem to love these measures that take everything to the nth degree.

27
00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:54.320
I mean, the idea that you can't do a drive in graduation,

28
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.970
everyone watching this knows how important that graduation moment is,

29
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.760
and to be able to look at your friends. And yes, it may be,

30
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.610
it's not the ideal situation that they're in a car next to you,

31
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.620
but that is a little more human than just a zillion people on a zoom screen.

32
00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:11.000
And the longer this goes,

33
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:15.110
and this is why I'm worried about the August one situation here in California is

34
00:02:15.111 --> 00:02:16.100
that the longer this goes,

35
00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:20.720
we will forget every little bit of what it was like to be a human just

36
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.590
two months ago. And you know, when they say August 1st, it's like, well,

37
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.240
I have a pretty good feeling that on July 28th, that Gavin Newsome or Eric are,

38
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.850
or one of the guys here in California is going to suddenly say, Hey,

39
00:02:31.851 --> 00:02:35.750
you know what guys? Didn't, uh, didn't flatten even more. So, uh,

40
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.730
now we're doing this through the election. I mean, that's,

41
00:02:37.731 --> 00:02:38.840
that's really the problem.

42
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.650
We don't have adults in the room who are honestly explaining things to us.

43
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.170
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.100
And because the date I did not the three months sounded like so extreme because

45
00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:49.491
it's like, well,

46
00:02:49.491 --> 00:02:52.280
where is the data telling you that in three months you would need to have it

47
00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:55.850
closed down. Dave, tell me like you are, you love California,

48
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.500
but you are seriously considering leaving state.

49
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.310
Yeah.

50
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.240
<v 2>I hate to say it Danna. You know how much I love it. This is my garage.</v>

51
00:03:06.241 --> 00:03:09.030
I've got a great studio here. I've got a great life here.

52
00:03:09.031 --> 00:03:12.330
I've built my career and family here. I don't want to go. But you know,

53
00:03:12.331 --> 00:03:15.960
at some point the rubber meets the road for all of us that talk for a living.

54
00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:16.441
And it's like,

55
00:03:16.441 --> 00:03:21.390
if I live in a place that is so out of whack with the things that I talk about,

56
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.910
uh, it starts not feeling right.

57
00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:27.600
So I'm considering all sorts of things and it's unfortunate, but, uh, you know,

58
00:03:27.601 --> 00:03:30.360
Abbott and Abbott in Texas, the governor of Texas,

59
00:03:30.361 --> 00:03:33.180
obviously on DeSantis in Florida, they're doing a nice job.

60
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.650
They're not just saying, Hey, open up,

61
00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:37.740
everyone run around and nobody put masks on and do whatever you want.

62
00:03:37.741 --> 00:03:41.930
They're saying, we're trying to figure out a way to move forward. And,

63
00:03:41.931 --> 00:03:43.980
and that's the thing. If you listen to much of the media,

64
00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:44.910
they make it sound like, Oh,

65
00:03:44.911 --> 00:03:47.130
they're opening up and everyone can do whatever they want.

66
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.740
And it's going to be spikes in two weeks. And it's like, no,

67
00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:51.930
they're trying to let us be free.

68
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.810
I thought the United States had something to do with freedom. Wasn't that?

69
00:03:54.811 --> 00:03:56.040
In one of the founding documents,

70
00:03:56.041 --> 00:03:57.630
there was something about freedom in something, wasn't it?

71
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.510
<v 1>I think so. I think so. We'll have to say,</v>

72
00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:04.290
and I know that you've invited to America study to be on your show.

73
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.010
So I will check out and see if they accept your invitation.

74
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.930
Say hi to Clyde for us.

75
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.670
Unedited can ask Dave Rubin. Thank you.

76
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.030
<v 2>If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics,</v>
