1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.610
<v 0>It's super clever. I mean, the argument is completely circular, right?</v>

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.890
They just say you're a racist and you say, well,

3
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.540
but you have no evidence of my racism. They say, well,

4
00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:09.510
you don't even recognize your own racism. You say, well then how am I racist?

5
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.000
They say, because you're complicit in a system of racism you say, right.

6
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:13.500
But the system isn't isn't racist.

7
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:15.330
Like you can't point to something in the streets, you know,

8
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.020
but it results in racial inequality. And therefore it is a racist system.

9
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.620
And therefore you are complicit in the system and therefore you're a racist and

10
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.370
you say, okay, well,

11
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.190
but all systems perpetuate racial inequality by even saying that you're

12
00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:28.920
demonstrating your white fragility, which means you're a racist, right?

13
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:33.150
Like this is basic Salem witch trial. If you sink, then you are innocence.

14
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:34.110
And if you float in your way.

15
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.910
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

16
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.560
<v 2>Sorta talked about this a little bit before,</v>

17
00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:48.500
but do you think there is a fundamental reason for that,

18
00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:52.610
that there is a fundamental reason that underlies the philosophy of someone who

19
00:00:52.611 --> 00:00:55.010
broadly is on the left versus on the right,

20
00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:57.590
that why people on the right are willing to do it.

21
00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:01.040
If I put someone on the left on my show, I put Marianne Williamson on,

22
00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:02.480
I put on Andrew Yang, Tulsi, average,

23
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.810
all the people on the right virtually who disagree with them say, ah, you know,

24
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:08.240
I disagree with her and him on this and that and the other thing, but it's glad.

25
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.550
Yeah. I'm glad you had the conversation. If I put someone,

26
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.100
if I put you on or pre-ground the lefties go bananas,

27
00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:15.200
I'm endorsing white supremacy. And the.

28
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.520
<v 0>Because I think that for the left and there are many liberals who buy into this,</v>

29
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.150
all, all human relations are power relations. Right?

30
00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:26.000
You saw this in sort of as reclined response to Matt Iglesias, right?

31
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.430
How did I end up on the same side as Matt Yglesias, man,

32
00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:30.770
I've got the Ralph wiggle of the internet, right? Like how,

33
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.250
how has this happened? But Matt Yglesias had the temerity to sign that letter.

34
00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:35.240
And then as recline was like,

35
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.150
there are a lot of people who stand up for them for free speech who are really

36
00:01:38.151 --> 00:01:41.270
doing this because it's a way of gaining power. And for a lot of people,

37
00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:43.220
this is on the left is how they think of things, right?

38
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.260
All human relationships are power dynamics.

39
00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:48.650
There are no big principles that we all share. Like freedom of speech matters.

40
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.620
That's just a bunch of people who are seeking to use the principle of freedom of

41
00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:55.670
speech as a weapon in order to reenact the hierarchy in order to preserve the

42
00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:56.930
hierarchy. And this argument,

43
00:01:56.931 --> 00:01:58.820
you see being made more and more by folks on the left,

44
00:01:58.821 --> 00:02:02.060
which is that rights are not actually universal principles that we all should

45
00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:05.420
hold to rights are just a way for me to shut you up while I'm still speaking.

46
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.231
Right. And that's,

47
00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:11.060
and I think that the liberal left has been somewhat warm to that

48
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:14.090
argument for, for awhile, at least warm enough that they're willing to hear it.

49
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.760
And they just didn't see it turning on them at any point.

50
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:18.860
The left moved so far so fast that the liberals were like,

51
00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:21.080
we were with you up until the point where you started canceling us.

52
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.140
And then we realized, Oh wait, that was, uh, that was a bad mistake. Right?

53
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.570
Iglesias was one of the guys who was like cheering on there's no cancel culture

54
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.120
or cancel the cancellation doesn't exist. And then the,

55
00:02:29.121 --> 00:02:33.080
and then it came for him and he was like, ah, this is bad. Right guys.

56
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.100
It's like, yes, it's bad. Well, yes, thank you for recognizing it as bad.

57
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.490
<v 2>Do you love seeing that now where there's this move by them now,</v>

58
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.460
AOC is doing this and a bunch of other people to completely tell us the cancel

59
00:02:43.461 --> 00:02:44.600
culture doesn't even exist.

60
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.680
<v 0>It's an exact statement of your imagination. But when she's not explaining that,</v>

61
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.410
that people are shooting each other in the inner city for bread, for bread,

62
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.340
right. Which is that,

63
00:02:52.341 --> 00:02:54.560
that's why you should want her on their playground is because they're hungry.

64
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.140
That's what I do when I'm hungry. You know, I say to my wife,

65
00:02:57.141 --> 00:03:00.160
are we out of cereal? She says, yes. And I go and shoot somebody in the face.

66
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.930
That's that's, that's the way I deal with my own personal hanger. But it,

67
00:03:03.931 --> 00:03:05.830
but when she's not saying that sort of stuff,

68
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.010
this is becoming a very popular notion on the left,

69
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:12.460
which is that all America is a group of people who are dispossessed and the

70
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:16.960
people who are victimizers and any principle that exists in the system that is

71
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:17.860
the victimizing system. Again,

72
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:20.530
this goes back to the Kennedy point or the Robin D'Angelo point.

73
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.580
Any aspect of that system is inherently bad and reinforces a power hierarchy.

74
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.090
And so you must remove those systems of power in order to allow the

75
00:03:28.091 --> 00:03:29.860
dispossessed, to claim their full share of the earth.

76
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.930
<v 2>You're a scifi guy. Do you sort of admire the beauty of their evil?</v>

77
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.180
You know what I mean? Like really at some level,

78
00:03:36.181 --> 00:03:41.130
like to create a system that that proves itself in and of itself is

79
00:03:41.131 --> 00:03:44.430
the proof. Like there's a certain beauty to that as evil as it is.

80
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.790
<v 0>The argument is completely circular, right? They, they just say,</v>

81
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.400
you're a racist and you say, well, but you have no evidence of my races.

82
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.440
And they say, well, you don't even recognize your own racism. You say,

83
00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:54.000
well then how am I racist? They said,

84
00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:56.280
because you're complicit in a system of racism say, right,

85
00:03:56.281 --> 00:03:57.750
but the system isn't isn't racist,

86
00:03:57.751 --> 00:03:59.610
like you can't point to something that straits you. No,

87
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.270
but it results in racial inequality. And therefore it is a racist system.

88
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.870
And therefore you are complicit in the system and therefore you're a racist and

89
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:07.650
you say, okay, well,

90
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.470
but all systems perpetuate racial inequality that even saying that you're

91
00:04:10.471 --> 00:04:13.200
demonstrating your white fragility, which means you're a racist, right?

92
00:04:13.201 --> 00:04:15.750
Like this is basic Salem witch trial.

93
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.540
If you sink then your innocence and if you float then your wedge.

94
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.500
<v 2>Yeah. All right. So a lot of this actually is very much the point of the book.</v>

95
00:04:22.501 --> 00:04:24.750
So just quickly before we fully go into that, uh,

96
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.490
just let's just do COVID quickly.

97
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.030
Like where the hell are we at in this let's let's just talk about California for

98
00:04:30.031 --> 00:04:31.050
a second. But we just,

99
00:04:31.051 --> 00:04:34.050
in the last couple of days went into another freaking lockdown.

100
00:04:34.051 --> 00:04:38.220
It's beautiful outside. I, I'm not sure what the beach situation is,

101
00:04:38.221 --> 00:04:40.740
whether we can go there, but I know I can't go to a restaurant. I was like,

102
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.870
what the hell is going on here at this point?

103
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.850
What do you think is honestly happening at this time?

104
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.300
<v 0>I think it was honestly happening is that you have a deadly disease that has</v>

105
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.280
probably somewhere between a two times and six times deadly as an

106
00:04:53.281 --> 00:04:57.960
effect, uh, as the fluids, if you can point to 1.6, uh, infection,

107
00:04:57.961 --> 00:05:01.170
fatality rate, uh, and that's dangerous. And it's very, very infectious.

108
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.490
And all of that is true.

109
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.670
The whole point of flattening the curve was to prevent the overwhelming of the

110
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:06.600
healthcare system.

111
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.820
We are not seeing the healthcare system being overwhelmed right now.

112
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.750
And so the idea that the only tactic that is available is full-scale lockdown I

113
00:05:12.751 --> 00:05:15.210
think is, is not backed by evidence.

114
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.240
I am also growing extraordinarily tired of people,

115
00:05:18.241 --> 00:05:21.450
shouting that they are on the side of science while variously changing their

116
00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:25.200
opinion, literally every 15 seconds. So when masks are bad, now masks are good.

117
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.620
Protests are bad with anti-lock and protests. Now protests are good.

118
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.620
And this woke virus, spirits. You so long as you're kneeling for George Floyd,

119
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.550
right? It's crazy. It's utterly nuts. I mean, that, that was,

120
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.470
that was mindbogglingly incredible.

121
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.600
<v 2>This week said that in effect,</v>

122
00:05:39.601 --> 00:05:44.160
you are allowed to protest because racism is so systemic and profoundly evil

123
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.120
that somehow it supersedes the deadly virus, but everyone else,

124
00:05:48.121 --> 00:05:50.340
a couple of Orthodox Jews playing in a park in Brooklyn.

125
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.620
<v 0>It's a, it's a seriously woke virus. I mean,</v>

126
00:05:52.621 --> 00:05:55.080
good for Colin Kaepernick who should win the Nobel peace prize as well as the

127
00:05:55.081 --> 00:05:57.210
Nobel prize in biology, because kneeling,

128
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.700
it turns out actually carries coronavirus,

129
00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:02.060
which is pretty awesome when you think about it, but it's yeah,

130
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.850
I think that there've been a bunch of false binaries that have been set up and

131
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:07.580
those false binaries are things like it's either total lockdown or total

132
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:08.240
openness.

133
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.480
It annoys me when people on the right treat mask scoring as though it's like a

134
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:12.110
virtue signal.

135
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.840
And it annoys me on the left when people treat mask wearing as though it's an

136
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:17.060
incredible virtue signal, you're an evil, evil person.

137
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.961
If you're not wearing a mask,

138
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:19.700
when you go to sleep at night and you're a better person,

139
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:21.920
if you wear a mask and on the, and on the right,

140
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:23.420
there are people for sure who are like, well,

141
00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:26.570
I'm not wearing a mask under any circumstance to violation of my freedoms and

142
00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:28.550
all those kinds of like, just when you're in a popular,

143
00:06:28.551 --> 00:06:31.490
when you're in a populated area with a lot of other people wear a mask,

144
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.383
it isn't that bad.

145
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.730
Like you should do it because you don't want other people to get sick.

146
00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:37.700
It's like, that's the best we can do at this point in time with that said,

147
00:06:37.701 --> 00:06:40.340
the idea that we're going to full scale locked down the entire American economy,

148
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.210
or that we are going to leave children out of school for the next year,

149
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.770
because of COVID like, that seems patently insane to me. I mean,

150
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.320
the reason it seems patently insane is because the data are pretty murky and a

151
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:54.350
lot of issues. There are absolutely not murky on the risk of children.

152
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.840
There's so little risk to children. If you're under the age of 20,

153
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.030
you have a better chance of dying from the flu than you do with COVID. I mean,

154
00:06:59.031 --> 00:07:00.020
that's just straight stat.

155
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.620
And what that means is that maybe we can come up with some creative solutions

156
00:07:03.621 --> 00:07:07.490
where parents actually have a place where their kids can go for schooling. So,

157
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.860
um, my friend, John Podhoretz over commentary magazine,

158
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:12.020
I thought he had a good idea. He said, why don't you keep the schools open?

159
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.940
And then you have a bunch of 20 year old proctors,

160
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.030
and then you have the teachers zoomin, why is it the teacher has the zooms,

161
00:07:17.031 --> 00:07:19.520
all the kids at home, right? Why don't they, why don't you just do it at school?

162
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.470
Right. That seems like a fairly decent idea. Um, but the, the,

163
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.150
the incentive structure is created for politicians to lock down because more

164
00:07:28.151 --> 00:07:31.690
sternly, you treat the virus, the better the media are going to treat you,

165
00:07:31.691 --> 00:07:33.460
right? The more virtuous you are. Right? Exactly.

166
00:07:33.461 --> 00:07:34.690
And this is how you see Andrew Cuomo,

167
00:07:34.691 --> 00:07:36.790
who was a garbage heap of a governor in this whole time.

168
00:07:36.791 --> 00:07:39.010
And who now creates magical posters,

169
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:42.340
tributes to himself with literally a curve that represents the number of dead

170
00:07:42.341 --> 00:07:45.940
bodies in his state, by being treated as though he was great at this,

171
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.400
when his death rate is like eight or nine times, that of Florida,

172
00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:51.550
where Rhonda Santas is the font of all evil and Greg Abbott in Texas,

173
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:55.330
it's like 11 or 12 times the death rate in Texas like this,

174
00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.400
none of the media coverage makes sense. And the media,

175
00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.740
there are a bunch of issues here. The politics of it makes more sense.

176
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.380
The media coverage of it makes some sense,

177
00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:05.230
but it's a really ugly sense because the politics have overwhelmed the data.

178
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.100
And then on a data level, there's just a lot. We,

179
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:09.550
we actually don't know at this point, right?

180
00:08:09.551 --> 00:08:12.250
We don't know whether there's such a thing as T-cell immunity.

181
00:08:12.251 --> 00:08:15.040
That's been one of the theories that herd immunity actually may start to kick in

182
00:08:15.041 --> 00:08:18.520
as low as 20%. This is a theater from Sweden. It could be at 60%.

183
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.810
We don't know whether this thing is how far away you have to be from somebody,

184
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.020
or they say six feet, but who was hanging a meter until five minutes ago,

185
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:26.410
by the way.

186
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.630
<v 2>Technically, my guys measured were seven feet. Oh.</v>

187
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:29.740
<v 0>Yeah, no. And I insisted on that, like,</v>

188
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.110
I'm a person who is taking this very seriously, right? I mean,

189
00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:34.840
like I I've been taking it seriously cause I have 65 year old parents.

190
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.560
So I'm not on the, let's be skeptical of all of this stuff.

191
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:39.850
But the idea that like,

192
00:08:39.851 --> 00:08:42.340
it's going to wipe out vast swabs of the American public and that,

193
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.760
and that it's the most dangerous thing that,

194
00:08:44.761 --> 00:08:46.330
that has ever existed on planet earth.

195
00:08:46.331 --> 00:08:49.990
And that we have to shut down the economy ad infinitum. Here's the problem.

196
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.530
Has anyone ever actually done on the, on the lockdown side,

197
00:08:53.531 --> 00:08:55.560
any analysis of what the costs are on the other side,

198
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.210
all I hear is if you mentioned those costs,

199
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.600
then you're bad and you don't go back into the things and that's, that's insane.

200
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.240
Like these are public policy decisions and we should obviously be having

201
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:06.750
conversations about how to protect the most vulnerable and also how to trans

202
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:08.160
people back in to work. I mean,

203
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:11.820
I've been saying for a long time that it may end up being that the way that we

204
00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:14.040
end up moving forward is what one,

205
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.950
I think it was Hebrew university or Tel Aviv.

206
00:09:16.951 --> 00:09:19.140
University scientists suggested was controlled avalanche.

207
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:21.330
The idea was if you're most vulnerable, you stay home.

208
00:09:21.331 --> 00:09:23.550
And we figured out ways to protect you. And if you're less vulnerable,

209
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.470
then you go out and if you get it, you get it.

210
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.400
And then you're one person closer to herd immunity that that may be effectively

211
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.860
defacto what we're seeing anyway. Right?

212
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.060
Cause this is how let's be real about this. If you're 20, this is.

213
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.230
<v 2>And this is where they're going to say, you want to kill people.</v>

214
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.070
That's what last time you were here, you were here for my book launch.

215
00:09:40.071 --> 00:09:43.610
And I remember you were the number one trend on Twitter because you said we're

216
00:09:43.611 --> 00:09:46.580
going to have to deal with some level of death. It's a problem we don't want to,

217
00:09:46.581 --> 00:09:49.970
but that's just the reality. And then they came after you and said, no, no,

218
00:09:49.971 --> 00:09:51.830
no one should die in our perfect.

219
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.950
<v 0>And I made the, I made the very pure and obvious which everyone,</v>

220
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.710
everyone understands. The argument I was making,

221
00:09:57.711 --> 00:10:00.980
which is that if you are looking at days of life versus just lives lost,

222
00:10:00.981 --> 00:10:04.730
that is a different calculation. And it has done by actuaries every single day.

223
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.640
The federal government has actuaries that do this on every single policy.

224
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.790
But again, the, the media narrative is, is very easy here.

225
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.370
If you don't mirror the policies they want, then you're a,

226
00:10:13.371 --> 00:10:15.500
you're a grandma Keller who wants to murder your, your own grandma.

227
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.220
It doesn't matter that I'm taking all sorts of extraordinary measures and our

228
00:10:19.221 --> 00:10:20.360
protect my own parents on this thing.

229
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:23.870
<v 2>If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics,</v>
