00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.980
<v 0>I went back recently. Uh,</v>

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.840
Rachel Peterson is our chief researcher and she pulled up 35 pages of

3
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:09.870
material on the actual black lives matter organization.

4
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.680
And when you have these founded by three Marxists, uh,

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.200
and when you read about their real beliefs,

6
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.040
you begin to understand they live in an alternative worldview.

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.920
They live in a world where the police are really very dangerous and they don't

8
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:28.410
quite have an explanation for all the other people that get killed,

9
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.630
because you're, if you're an African-American male,

10
00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:35.260
you're 300 times more likely to be shot by a criminal than by the police. Uh,

11
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.380
but that doesn't matter because you know,

12
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.940
the police are an extension of the authoritarian power of the white male

13
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:44.790
dominated culture, which is what they're really mad about.

14
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.020
<v 1>This has come up with almost all of my guests,</v>

15
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.370
because everyone at this point basically agrees that the media is crumbling.

16
00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:57.080
They've done this to themselves. They,

17
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.230
they seem to double down every time instead of, you know,

18
00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:02.540
having a moment of self-reflection. Uh,

19
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.410
but are you worried that if the New York times fails, if CNN,

20
00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:08.930
if it just the media and then the rest of the institutions,

21
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.050
cause that then spreads to academia and everywhere else that if these

22
00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:14.390
institutions all crumble, you know, you know,

23
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:18.740
we almost have no way of having a national ethos at some level.

24
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.060
<v 0>Well, I look, I think there are other institutions that emerge.</v>

25
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.530
I think there's an amazing amount of information now on the internet,

26
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.820
through Facebook and YouTube and a bride litter, all the Twitters, right?

27
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.870
There's a lot of hostility in it, but, uh, you know,

28
00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:40.250
and then you have places like CSPAN, which really are, uh, remarkably neutral.

29
00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:43.340
In fact, I have watched several Trump's speeches on C-SPAN.

30
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.520
You also have an ability to stream things. The president, uh,

31
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.540
strange a lot of his speeches and what's the now watch his speeches, uh,

32
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.810
as stream from the white house. We also, frankly, during the lockdown,

33
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.030
got into watching both the St Peter's, uh, and, uh, the Basilica in Washington,

34
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.890
because they were streaming mass.

35
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.430
So you're entering a world of dramatically more media,

36
00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:07.910
not less than just as your show is another example of more media,

37
00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:12.860
not less media, but we're going to have a really deep split because, uh,

38
00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:14.690
we're in the middle of a cultural, civil war.

39
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.430
And it there's just no question in my mind that this is the most divided we've

40
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:24.380
been since the election of Lincoln in 1860 and his reelection in

41
00:02:24.381 --> 00:02:28.100
1864. And that part of the reason I wrote, uh,

42
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.960
Trump and the American future is that I really do believe that

43
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.880
what happens this fall may do more to shape America's future

44
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.720
than any election since 1864. Uh,

45
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.500
and I say that because I think that the Biden

46
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.590
Polosi Schumer team will be so radical that

47
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.590
we would not recognize the country within two or three years,

48
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.600
they would have moved to so far to the left.

49
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.870
<v 1>Do you think that it's the Schumer Pelosi team that are actually the true</v>

50
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:03.820
radicals, or do you think it's the,

51
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.790
it's the Bernie crew and the AOC crew beneath them?

52
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:10.300
That's sort of just shifting them that way or do you really feel like they are

53
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.070
actually that radical?

54
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.520
It's a little hard to tell these days if they're a little more old school and

55
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:17.710
the, you know, the tail is wagging the dog, basically.

56
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.520
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, a little bit like saying when you got,</v>

57
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.680
when you got run over by the truck, you know,

58
00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:25.050
do you think the driver was deliberately trying to robbery or

59
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.460
you got run over, um, when Schumer,

60
00:03:29.461 --> 00:03:32.610
the other day came out for the 10% cut in defense spending,

61
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.030
which Sanders is operating as an amendment. Uh,

62
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.020
and when Pelosi brought up a bill, which 207 Democrats voted for,

63
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.440
that gives a $1,200 bonus to every illegal immigrant.

64
00:03:43.441 --> 00:03:47.790
I want you to think about this 207 Democrats voted to give a

65
00:03:47.791 --> 00:03:51.780
$1,200 bonus check to every illegal immigrant.

66
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.980
I mean, you have to wonder that these people just crazy, um,

67
00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.680
Biden who said that he would, uh, sign the Pelosi bill,

68
00:04:01.681 --> 00:04:05.550
which was a $3 trillion, very radical bill. Um,

69
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.110
you certainly didn't see Biden, uh, criticizing, uh,

70
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.970
the looters and the violence. In fact,

71
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.860
13 of Biden's staff actually helped bail out looters and violent

72
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.020
people in, uh, Minneapolis. Uh, so I just,

73
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.620
you know, I think there's a pattern in, in, uh, Trump and the American future.

74
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.910
I put in, uh,

75
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.280
a chapter that the Democrats love criminals and hate beliefs.

76
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.350
And I think if you look at Seattle, Minneapolis, Chicago, New York,

77
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.630
I think that that's the objective evidence.

78
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.130
<v 1>So as we watch these progressive cities crumble,</v>

79
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.220
the several you just named there, and we can, we can go on the list,

80
00:04:47.221 --> 00:04:50.340
all the cities with the worst violence and the worst gun violence and the

81
00:04:50.341 --> 00:04:52.530
highest rates of murders there, they're all, I think,

82
00:04:52.531 --> 00:04:55.950
19 out of 20 or something like that are progressive run cities.

83
00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.320
Do you sense that sort of what those mayors and the governors to another

84
00:05:01.321 --> 00:05:05.700
extent want is they want the chaos so that Trump has to bring in

85
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.260
troops or the national guard,

86
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:11.640
like they're almost laying out a trap so that he looks like the authoritarian

87
00:05:11.641 --> 00:05:12.780
that they wish him to be.

88
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.510
<v 0>No, I, I think, um, I mean, I don't think they mind that happening,</v>

89
00:05:18.511 --> 00:05:19.650
but I don't think that's what they're doing.

90
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.900
I think that the left really has this fantasy image of how the

91
00:05:24.901 --> 00:05:28.920
world works. And they really think that if only there were no policemen,

92
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:30.560
instead, it's sort of like the,

93
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.650
the democratic mayor of Seattle who said that we were going to have a summer of

94
00:05:34.651 --> 00:05:37.200
love when they created the autonomous district.

95
00:05:37.201 --> 00:05:41.340
Now four people got killed and she gave up on that. Although ironically,

96
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.570
she didn't really give up on it until the demonstrators came to her home one

97
00:05:45.571 --> 00:05:50.370
night. And then when they were surrounding her house, that's what she said,

98
00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:53.010
something that's true. But I think, um,

99
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.490
part of it is that they're, they're radical left-wing ideology.

100
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.250
Doesn't allow them to deal with reality.

101
00:06:01.251 --> 00:06:05.660
So you end up with a let's cut the budget of the New York police department of

102
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:09.350
billion dollars when there were, I think, um,

103
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.120
13 people shot. Yeah. On Monday. Uh,

104
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.870
Chicago has few too few policemen, not too many,

105
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.190
and they have a dozen or more people shot every weekend. Um,

106
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.280
you know, after all the problems in Minneapolis, they're now moving to, uh,

107
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.930
dissolve the police department. And, and, and to my mind,

108
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.520
you know, if you, if you stop and say, wait, walk me through this. Uh,

109
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.210
there's an armed gunman. Uh, it's two o'clock in the morning.

110
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.890
You're going to send social workers, the chat with the Gutman.

111
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:50.660
I just need to understand how their worldview works, but I've,

112
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.000
but I've, I went back recently, uh,

113
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.860
Rachel Peterson is our chief researcher and she pulled up 35 pages of

114
00:06:57.861 --> 00:07:00.890
material on the actual black lives matter organization.

115
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.700
And when you have these founded by three Marxist, uh,

116
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.220
and when you read about their real beliefs,

117
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.060
you begin to understand they live in an alternative worldview.

118
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.910
They live in a world where the police are really very dangerous and they don't

119
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:19.820
quite have an explanation for all the other people get killed. Cause you're,

120
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.650
if you're an African-American male,

121
00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:26.290
you're 300 times more likely to be shot by a criminal than by the police. Uh,

122
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.400
that doesn't matter because you know,

123
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.960
the police are an extension of the authoritarian power of the white male

124
00:07:32.961 --> 00:07:35.840
dominated culture, which is what they're really mad about.

125
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.690
Whereas if you just have them get killed by your neighbor,

126
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.730
that doesn't really count. So, you know,

127
00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:43.910
an eight year old girl gets killed in Atlanta. Well, that's unfortunate,

128
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.000
but it's not something that black lives matter is going to do anything about,

129
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.900
but she wasn't killed by a policeman. Seven year old gets killed in Chicago.

130
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.400
Well, that's really unfortunate,

131
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.630
but it's not really a political event cause she wasn't killed by a policeman.

132
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:01.400
So you really have this very weird period underway where the left has

133
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:07.100
no model to explain how they would achieve peace

134
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.570
just as, by the way,

135
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.360
they have no model to explain how they would educate children.

136
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.580
You look at Baltimore, which has the fourth,

137
00:08:13.581 --> 00:08:18.020
most expensive school system in the country and has entire

138
00:08:18.021 --> 00:08:21.650
buildings and watch not a single child can pass the exam.

139
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.120
Not one to which a Biden's comments this week were.

140
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:31.400
Maybe we need to quit, um, testing because after all, uh,

141
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.280
probably makes them feel bad that they didn't pass the test.

142
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.660
