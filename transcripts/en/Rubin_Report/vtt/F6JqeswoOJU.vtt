WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.680
<v 0>You know that when people say, how did you get, you know,</v>

2
00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:04.980
suburban women and how do you get minorities and how do you get Democrats and

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.500
independents to vote for a Republican? Uh,

4
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.260
but I think it's one of the things that Republican party is going to have to

5
00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:14.430
think about how do we reach out to a wider group of people in order to win

6
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:18.210
elections in the future? So we can be in a position of making decisions.

7
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.460
<v 2>Do you think bottom line,</v>

8
00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:31.280
when you get rid of all the other issues that you're dealing with all day,

9
00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:32.061
that if you,

10
00:00:32.061 --> 00:00:35.870
as a governor can keep the economy chugging and keep people at work that you've

11
00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:37.050
basically done your.

12
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.670
<v 0>Well, we, you know, we're wrestling with all kinds of really tough issues. Dave,</v>

13
00:00:43.671 --> 00:00:47.660
when you're governor of the state, as I mentioned, you know, we're dealing with,

14
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.780
uh, you know, close to a $50 billion budget and, you know,

15
00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:52.220
60 some thousand employees,

16
00:00:52.221 --> 00:00:55.100
we have to provide all these different services are so many different issues,

17
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.750
but really it is we're dealing with educating folks and handling transportation

18
00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:04.310
and, you know, law enforcement, all these multitude of things. Uh,

19
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.173
but the,

20
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.290
the focus that brought everybody together in our state that they could agree on,

21
00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:13.100
they could argue about various, uh, you know, different issues.

22
00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:16.460
But the one thing they all agreed on was the pocket book issues.

23
00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:19.850
And that's how I put together. I put a group together called change, Maryland.

24
00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:22.010
It was a nonpartisan citizen organization.

25
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.370
And we had just as many Democrats and independence as Republicans.

26
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.430
And they were just saying, let's focus on these issues.

27
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.650
Let's not argue about all these other things right now.

28
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.250
Let's just focus on this. And, uh, we brought together a coalition.

29
00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:37.370
It turned out to be a winning coalition and, and, uh, you know, they,

30
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.690
when people say, how did you get, you know,

31
00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:41.960
suburban women and how do you get minorities and how do you get Democrats and

32
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.510
independents to vote for a Republican? Uh,

33
00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:47.270
but I think it's one of the things that Republican party is going to have to

34
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:51.440
think about how do we reach out to a wider group of people in order to win

35
00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:55.220
elections in the future? So we can be in the position of making decisions.

36
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.710
<v 2>Yeah. So I want to get more to that and the,</v>

37
00:01:57.711 --> 00:02:00.550
the sort of pure political side in a minute, but let, let's talk about what's,

38
00:02:00.551 --> 00:02:01.250
what's going.

39
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.390
<v 0>To get too political on your day.</v>

40
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.900
<v 2>A governor getting political. I can't believe it.</v>

41
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.540
<v 0>Yeah, let's do that anymore. Yeah.</v>

42
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.560
<v 2>Yeah. Let's, let's talk about what's going on now though, because, uh, you know,</v>

43
00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:16.430
there's been, I think the major conversation really, um,

44
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.870
at a high level is sort of what the federal government is supposed to do related

45
00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:25.790
to coronavirus and what the state governments are supposed to

46
00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:29.900
do. Um, I suspect, I generally know your thoughts on this, but,

47
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.370
but what do you think your job as a governor is write down what is not your job?

48
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.620
What is the job of the federal.

49
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.420
<v 0>Government? Why is a great question? Look,</v>

50
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.250
I think that governors are on the front lines of this crisis and we ought to be

51
00:02:43.251 --> 00:02:46.760
we're we're. We are out there, we're closest to the people's problems.

52
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:49.310
We're working together with our, our local governments.

53
00:02:49.311 --> 00:02:52.280
And we're trying to really address these issues that are on the ground in our

54
00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:56.270
individual States. And each of our States are different we're we're going after,

55
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.640
you know, the different, uh, situations on the ground in our States. Um,

56
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.170
but there was, there was a major,

57
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.620
there were certain big things that only the federal government could do well.

58
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.950
So, you know, early on in this crisis, um,

59
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.900
the federal government could have taken more of a role in an overall testing

60
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:16.780
strategy. They did, you know, they were a little bit, I think,

61
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:20.230
behind the eight ball on, um, in the early stages.

62
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.680
And I talk about this in my book a little bit in March and April when they

63
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:25.360
weren't taking it as seriously. I mean,

64
00:03:25.361 --> 00:03:27.250
there were people in the administration who were,

65
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.610
I think the president downplayed it a little more than he should have,

66
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.240
and they didn't develop a lot of national strategies.

67
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.640
We had 50 individual state strategies.

68
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.750
I'm not saying States shouldn't have had the authority and independence to be

69
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:41.830
able to make their own decisions,

70
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:46.180
but certain things like we shouldn't have 50 States competing with one another

71
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.180
in a constrained market for desperately needed supplies,

72
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:52.510
competing with the federal government and trying to acquire things all over the

73
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:55.780
world. Um, so on testing and contact tracing,

74
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:59.230
and some of the major issues that the power of the federal government could

75
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:01.300
really have helped with the pandemic.

76
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.760
And in some respects they're getting better. Um,

77
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.220
but certain things the federal government can just do better.

78
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.030
<v 2>Can you talk a little bit about how you specifically make decisions when</v>

79
00:04:12.031 --> 00:04:15.180
it comes to lock down or the rest of it? Because as you know,

80
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.470
I'm here in Los Angeles, California, we've had rolling lockdowns,

81
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.780
then they kicked in again,

82
00:04:21.781 --> 00:04:25.140
last week I was actually out to lunch for the first time in weeks.

83
00:04:25.141 --> 00:04:29.460
And as I was having lunch, we got the notification on my phone that said,

84
00:04:29.461 --> 00:04:33.360
the restaurants are closing in two hours. Now everything's closed again.

85
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.690
And I've been very critical of Gavin Newsome our governor here,

86
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.070
not necessarily because of what he's doing rather than the messaging.

87
00:04:41.071 --> 00:04:44.640
It seems like they just, they just give edicts. They never say, well,

88
00:04:44.641 --> 00:04:46.800
we've seen these numbers change this way.

89
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.980
We know this behavior change this or that. It's just, Oh,

90
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.820
now we're locking down. We'll see you in August. We'll see you in September.

91
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.340
And, and that's what I'm sort of more concerned about.

92
00:04:56.341 --> 00:04:59.580
Can you talk a little bit about how you message things and how you actually come

93
00:04:59.581 --> 00:05:00.414
to the decisions?

94
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.790
<v 0>Yeah, it was great question, Dave,</v>

95
00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:04.740
and you hit on a couple of really good points. First of all,

96
00:05:04.741 --> 00:05:08.400
I agree that the messaging has been a problem on B. You know,

97
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.940
I think a lot of the governors are not messaging very well. And frankly,

98
00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:16.170
I think that's where the president's bigness biggest weaknesses have been on the

99
00:05:16.171 --> 00:05:18.490
messaging side. Um, I,

100
00:05:18.491 --> 00:05:22.620
I've tried to be just very direct and upfront and provide as much information as

101
00:05:22.621 --> 00:05:25.960
possible because I think most people, uh, whether the, the,

102
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.950
the news is good or bad, if you're, if you're just, you know,

103
00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:32.070
Frank with them and you supply the facts in a situation like this,

104
00:05:32.071 --> 00:05:34.290
when we're dealing with, you know, in some cases,

105
00:05:34.291 --> 00:05:37.650
life and death matters in a serious health crisis and a global pandemic and an

106
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.870
economic collapse, potentially. Um,

107
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.140
people want to know the facts and they want to know why you're making decisions.

108
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.720
So, you know, I think I'm not the only one doing it,

109
00:05:45.721 --> 00:05:48.600
but there number the governors who have been more direct and open and

110
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.620
transparent,

111
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.880
I think I've been the most successful on the decision-making process.

112
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.130
I just tried to get, um, you know,

113
00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.380
we had to make decisions really quickly in this thing because it wasn't like we

114
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:04.130
have deliberations with our legislature and let's talk about it and form a

115
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:07.490
committee. You know, this was happening really fast at the beginning.

116
00:06:07.491 --> 00:06:10.280
As we were spiking, we were seeing things happening in Italy,

117
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.480
in New York and people dying and body stacked up and overflowing hospitals.

118
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:17.690
And we were hearing these things about 2 million potential deaths.

119
00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:22.280
And so we were, it was speed time. It was of the essence to make some decisions.

120
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.900
Um, you had to make the right decisions quickly. You couldn't hesitate,

121
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.800
but I wanted to get the best advice I could from the smartest people.

122
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.720
We put together a task force of really smart doctors and scientists and business

123
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:38.570
people. And, and I just tried to get the best input.

124
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.170
It listened to everyone and then make decisions without hesitating, um,

125
00:06:43.171 --> 00:06:46.190
and then communicate it really well to the people about this is what we're

126
00:06:46.191 --> 00:06:48.800
doing, and here's why, and here's how it's going to help.

127
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:53.330
And so we took very aggressive and early actions did things that I never would

128
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:56.720
have imagined ever doing, but it helped us flatten the curve. I mean,

129
00:06:56.721 --> 00:06:59.720
our numbers are really good. Our economy's really good. Uh,

130
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.340
we took early and aggressive action.

131
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.750
We'd had a safe and effective reopening and, uh, you know, we're now, you know,

132
00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:08.870
way down from our peak, that happened about more than 90 days ago.

133
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.180
We've opened up 98% of our economy.

134
00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:15.230
And our unemployment at 8% is staggering, but it's, it's, you know,

135
00:07:15.231 --> 00:07:18.470
some States are two and a half times worse, better than the rest of the country.

136
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.920
Um, and, and our numbers, well, you know,

137
00:07:21.921 --> 00:07:26.210
we we've had a number of deaths and we had the same problems other people had

138
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.200
we're in great shape right now.

139
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.360
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

140
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.230
On a personal note as a guy that didn't want to always get into politics when

141
00:07:32.231 --> 00:07:34.150
you have to make those decisions about, okay,

142
00:07:34.151 --> 00:07:36.790
we're going to extend the lock down, we're going to lift the lockdown,

143
00:07:36.791 --> 00:07:39.850
whatever it may be. Um, what was that like for you?

144
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.390
Because I think people think of P people think of politicians sort of as robots,

145
00:07:43.391 --> 00:07:45.090
like, Oh, they just make the choices, but yeah.

146
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.660
<v 0>Yeah, no, it, it was really, really hard. David's, you know,</v>

147
00:07:49.661 --> 00:07:52.150
I've been through and I talk about some of these, you know,

148
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.320
personal and professional struggles battles that I've been through in my book.

149
00:07:56.321 --> 00:07:58.630
And I share some of that, you know, what it was like, and,

150
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.470
and all the things that I had to deal with on a personal level or what battles I

151
00:08:02.471 --> 00:08:05.740
went through as governor or getting elected governor.

152
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.220
This was the hardest thing that I think I've had to deal with. Um,

153
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.330
something we never imagined dealing with. And it wasn't just, you know,

154
00:08:13.331 --> 00:08:17.170
I went through a cancer battle where I was worried about how my family was going

155
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.300
to take it, or, you know, w w what was,

156
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.490
I was dealing with other cancer patients,

157
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.400
but this was what I was worried about 6 million people in my state.

158
00:08:24.401 --> 00:08:28.420
And my decisions were going to impact not only their health, but I'm a lifelong,

159
00:08:28.421 --> 00:08:29.171
small business guy,

160
00:08:29.171 --> 00:08:32.830
ran for governor with the sole purpose of creating jobs and helping small

161
00:08:32.831 --> 00:08:34.840
businesses and decisions I was going to make,

162
00:08:34.841 --> 00:08:36.730
we're going to impact it was going to cost people,

163
00:08:36.731 --> 00:08:41.080
jobs and hurt their small businesses, or people were going to die. Um,

164
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.460
it, it was a really hard situation to be put in. And, and frankly,

165
00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:47.320
the president, um, et cetera, still left it up. He said,

166
00:08:47.321 --> 00:08:51.190
it's up to the governors. And we were getting, you know, um, you know,

167
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.200
open up and then, you know, but you have to shut down.

168
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.580
He was giving him th th the administration was given us advice.

169
00:08:56.581 --> 00:09:00.180
You have to do these things, or we're going to have 2 million deaths. And then,

170
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.840
uh, you know, messaging the opposite stuff the next day. So it was,

171
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.970
we were in tough situations, but I think,

172
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.140
and everybody made different decisions, but, uh, on a personal level, I mean,

173
00:09:10.141 --> 00:09:14.310
it's, there's been very little sleep for five months and a lot of stress.

174
00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:17.400
And you got people that are mad at you either way, no matter what you do,

175
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.700
you can't make everybody happy. And, um, you know,

176
00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:24.240
I just tried to do the very best I could, based on the information I had and,

177
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.450
um, you know, try to do the best thing for, for the people in the state.

178
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.550
<v 2>Yeah. So let's talk about the other thing that's going on.</v>

179
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.190
Cause there is another thing going on. There's always a lot of things,

180
00:09:34.191 --> 00:09:36.260
but there's sort of two main ones going on at the moment.

181
00:09:36.261 --> 00:09:40.550
And the second one obviously is I guess the best way to

182
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:45.050
describe it is either the racial unrest or the protesting or the rioting,

183
00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:49.490
just the whole conversation we're having the, the toppling of, of monuments.

184
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:54.170
Now, again, you're in Maryland D C's right there. Awful lot of monuments, awful.

185
00:09:54.171 --> 00:09:58.730
Lot of history is right in your backyard. Um, you know, you've got,

186
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:03.020
you've got Baltimore there, which has its own set of set of problems. Um,

187
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.430
so I'm not even going to ask you a question.

188
00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:07.820
I'm just going to ha I'm going to just pass all that off to you. Take it away.

189
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.630
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. Well, that was, that's what you were just going to let me tee it up.</v>

190
00:10:11.631 --> 00:10:16.130
And, um, so I, I, you know, you look at the title of the book. It's like riots,

191
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.800
you know, cancer riots, a global pandemic.

192
00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:23.030
I dealt with this and I talk about this a lot and there's real parallels to

193
00:10:23.031 --> 00:10:26.660
what's going on right now with the, the riots, the, the violence, the,

194
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.620
the unrest, the protests, or however you want to describe it.

195
00:10:30.621 --> 00:10:32.990
There's a little bit of all of that going on across America,

196
00:10:32.991 --> 00:10:33.824
in different cities.

197
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.130
<v 2>We're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics</v>
