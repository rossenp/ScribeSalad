1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.910
<v 0>We're doing the book tour. And all of a sudden, I get this email, um,</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.460
that the Huffington post is saying that George W.

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.060
Bush plagiarized some of his book, like what's he talking about?

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.860
Because I knew that he and, and,

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.780
and a former speech writer had worked on all of it together. I probably taught,

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.660
so I read it. I'm like, Oh my gosh.

7
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:23.400
So this reporter for Huffington post wrote that in Bob

8
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:26.070
Woodward's book from like three time, three years ago,

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.120
there's a passage in there in which Bob Woodward quotes,

10
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.620
somebody who was a source close to the president,

11
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.930
um, who said this about the Iraq war. And therefore they said that, that,

12
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.360
that George W. Bush,

13
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.580
that in decision points that therefore he was plagiarizing Bob Woodward.

14
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.190
And I was like, obviously, he's the source close to the president?

15
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:55.800
Is the president you dumb? Sorry, can we say that?

16
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.630
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

17
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.200
<v 2>I remember during the Iraq war and you being up there and all the things I lived</v>

18
00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:13.490
on the upper West of New York city, the most liberal place on earth, and,

19
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.060
you know, outside Zabar's, they'd have the book, uh, tables.

20
00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:21.110
And every book was George W. Bush was the devil and evil and all of that stuff.

21
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.840
We're now the media, because he's not Trump.

22
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.800
They sort of treat him like a nice guy. He's also a little older, he paints now.

23
00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:31.940
So they, he's kind of good now. And Trump is the ultimate evil.

24
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.260
Do you see that sort of always churning through like every 10 years where the

25
00:01:36.261 --> 00:01:39.980
media takes someone they hate now they're good because they have a new bad guy

26
00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:42.710
and that these pieces will always sort of shift around.

27
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.800
<v 0>I have a great story for you about that. Um,</v>

28
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.050
Marlin Fitzwater was the press secretary for Ronald Reagan and George H w Bush.

29
00:01:51.051 --> 00:01:54.380
So for eight years, he was a press secretary for eight years.

30
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.310
I joke with him that he could never have done that in the age of social media.

31
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.510
But, um, he told me that, well,

32
00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:06.740
actually I invited him to my house. In October of 2008.

33
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.170
I invited all of my staff from the press room. I made them all read his book.

34
00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:16.250
One of the best books ever written in Washington, DC as a memoir, it's called,

35
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.940
called a briefing by Marlon Fitzwater. It's fantastic.

36
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.800
His storytelling is spectacular.

37
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.290
So he came and we had a little book club and he delivered a

38
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:29.480
message to all of us. And he said, um, you know,

39
00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:34.190
I know you're feeling like your boss is really being dragged through the

40
00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:36.770
mud. Our approval ratings were terrible.

41
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.940
This is right after the financial crisis, as you can imagine. And he said, um,

42
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.740
let me tell you a story about in 1992 and January 92, um,

43
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.040
they had lost or 93, they had lost to bill Clinton.

44
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.260
And he said it was so mortifying to lose to bill Clinton.

45
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.880
And he said, when we left that day, he said,

46
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.850
I had my head was hanging so low because I thought no one will ever ever

47
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:08.410
understand and see what a great man George HW Bush was.

48
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.110
Well, he, that changed, you know, time.

49
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:18.820
It has a way of changing perspective and 43, he used to say,

50
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:21.610
when I would prep him for interviews toward the end, I said, sir,

51
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:24.940
they're going to ask you what you think your legacy is going to be. And he said,

52
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.470
look, you know, last year I read three books about George Washington.

53
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.760
And if historians are still analyzing the first president,

54
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.670
then the 43rd doesn't have a lot to worry about because he'll never know.

55
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.470
And he would point out that Abraham Lincoln died thinking that the country

56
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:45.280
thought he was a failure. So, yes,

57
00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:50.200
I think that the fact that 43 could help me lift my

58
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.660
gaze from current crisis and current feelings and lift my gaze and understand

59
00:03:55.661 --> 00:04:00.250
there's a longer view. And that really helped me in my life actually,

60
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.580
overall, not just in politics. Yeah.

61
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.463
<v 2>I love that.</v>

62
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.610
Can you talk a little bit about just generally what it's like sorta working at

63
00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:11.160
Fox and being in the eye of the storm,

64
00:04:11.161 --> 00:04:15.990
where often you guys are as critiqued as the politicians you're

65
00:04:15.991 --> 00:04:17.910
supposed to be talking about. And I,

66
00:04:17.911 --> 00:04:22.740
and this is a particularly unique thing to Fox where every given day,

67
00:04:22.741 --> 00:04:27.540
we know that media matters is watching you guys waiting for you to stumble

68
00:04:27.541 --> 00:04:31.530
over some word. Then they clip that video, they get it out to HuffPo,

69
00:04:31.531 --> 00:04:35.070
they get it to box. They try, you know, they lie about timelines.

70
00:04:35.071 --> 00:04:39.180
Greg's dealing with the version of this right now related to a Corona virus. Um,

71
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.770
how in a weird way, the stories then become about you or that, you know,

72
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.730
somebody's boycotting talker on any given day. Just that, that whole thing.

73
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.640
<v 0>So I have a ton of respect for the media relations department at Fox news,</v>

74
00:04:53.641 --> 00:04:56.640
because they are dealing with a,

75
00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.000
they are drinking from a fire hose every single day. Um,

76
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.320
and we have strong personalities at the network and we have the freedom to say

77
00:05:04.321 --> 00:05:08.880
what we want to say. I'm usually pretty left, pretty much left alone.

78
00:05:08.881 --> 00:05:12.810
I guess maybe I don't say anything that controversial or interesting for,

79
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.981
for them to bother,

80
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:18.930
but I don't like it when someone who is expressing an opinion and

81
00:05:18.931 --> 00:05:22.440
then gets, it gets distorted. I really can't stand that.

82
00:05:22.441 --> 00:05:25.980
And this is an example that I wanted to mention. It just came to mind.

83
00:05:25.981 --> 00:05:27.720
It doesn't have exactly to do with Fox,

84
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.260
but it's a good example of my experience of dealing with the media.

85
00:05:31.261 --> 00:05:33.060
And you mentioned, um, Huffington post.

86
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.670
So I did the PR for George w bushes memoir

87
00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:39.540
decision points.

88
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.040
When it came out in 2010 and we're out there,

89
00:05:44.041 --> 00:05:48.330
the book is launched going pretty well. Although 43 boy,

90
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.380
he had not done interviews in two years and he was not excited to see the press

91
00:05:52.381 --> 00:05:53.310
again, I'll tell you that.

92
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.800
<v 2>I bet. Well, he really, he, you know, often presidents for a little while,</v>

93
00:05:57.801 --> 00:06:00.800
but he sort of, he really just went under the radar. Finally,

94
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:02.900
there was that picture of him painting and people were like, Oh.

95
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.510
<v 0>Yeah, he said, um, for a long time, he said, I don't seek the Klieg lights.</v>

96
00:06:07.511 --> 00:06:08.980
I don't want this attention.

97
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.960
And he knew that there was another chapter and that he had watched his

98
00:06:13.961 --> 00:06:18.610
dad be such a gracious former president. And that's, that was his role model.

99
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.970
But back to the book tour. So we're doing the book tour and all of a sudden,

100
00:06:21.971 --> 00:06:25.930
I get this email that the Huffington post is saying that George W.

101
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.500
Bush plagiarized some of his book, like what's he talking about?

102
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.340
Because I knew that he and, and,

103
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.920
and a former speech writer had worked on all of it together. Like,

104
00:06:35.921 --> 00:06:39.130
what are you talking? So I read it. I'm like, Oh my gosh.

105
00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:43.870
So this reporter for Huffington post wrote that in Bob

106
00:06:43.871 --> 00:06:46.540
Woodward's book from like three time, three years ago,

107
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.590
there's a passage in there in which Bob Woodward quotes,

108
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.090
somebody who was a source close to the president,

109
00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.480
um, who said this about the Iraq war. And therefore they said that, that,

110
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.830
that George W. Bush,

111
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.050
that in decision points that therefore he was plagiarizing Bob Woodward.

112
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.660
And I was like, obviously he's the source close to the president.

113
00:07:13.661 --> 00:07:16.690
Is the president you dumb? Sorry, can we say that on here?

114
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.110
<v 2>Hey, you can say anything here. Come on. Now.</v>

115
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.120
<v 0>I remember how mad I was.</v>

116
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:27.010
And it just so happened that the publisher of the book was also the publisher of

117
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.420
Arianna Huffington's books.

118
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.200
So I was getting nowhere with the reporter to take it down.

119
00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:36.880
And so she said that she would call and get her to handle it and do you know,

120
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.590
they would not take it down.

121
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.160
And so I'm not a stranger to this behavior and how they

122
00:07:45.161 --> 00:07:49.930
treated him, um, or other conservatives or Trump now today. Uh,

123
00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.100
it's just, it's unfortunate, but you just have to work around it. Okay.

124
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:55.431
<v 2>Yeah. But it may,</v>

125
00:07:55.431 --> 00:08:00.130
it must take a certain amount of your mental stamina during the day, right?

126
00:08:00.131 --> 00:08:02.110
Knowing that these guys are watching you,

127
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.700
or even when you're just talking on your show,

128
00:08:03.701 --> 00:08:07.420
and yet you might accidentally say, and then you go, Oh.

129
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.980
<v 0>Um, that I said that the guy carrying the alligator with his mouth taped in the</v>

130
00:08:11.981 --> 00:08:16.180
convenience store and it was during one more thing. And I said, what an? And,

131
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.610
Oh my God. And that's unusual for me.

132
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.320
And it caused such an uproar, but we turned it into something funny.

133
00:08:23.321 --> 00:08:27.400
And actually the president of the company got a call from his mom. And she said,

134
00:08:27.401 --> 00:08:31.150
please don't get mad at Dana. Don't get her in any trouble.

135
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:34.570
She didn't mean to Sue say it, it was an accident.

136
00:08:34.571 --> 00:08:37.120
And besides she was right, the guy was an.

137
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:41.740
<v 2>He, he was, there you go. Can you talk a little bit, a little bit about the,</v>

138
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.100
a little bit about the general culture at Fox? Because, you know,

139
00:08:45.101 --> 00:08:49.270
until I started going on a bunch of these shows like a year ago, I don't know.

140
00:08:49.271 --> 00:08:52.840
I probably thought whatever, maybe the mainstream site Geist is,

141
00:08:52.841 --> 00:08:56.730
but I know that, you know, I've been doing your show once a week for awhile now.

142
00:08:56.731 --> 00:08:59.970
And I go on Greg and Tucker, nobody asks me anything. You know,

143
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:01.950
the first few times I went on Tucker, they would say, Oh,

144
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:05.580
do you have some ideas that you want to talk about? But now you guys invite me.

145
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:07.200
I go on, we don't discuss anything.

146
00:09:07.201 --> 00:09:10.860
I know that I could say anything in those few minutes. And you,

147
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.380
you may not agree with me, but you'd be okay with it.

148
00:09:13.381 --> 00:09:16.560
And we can joke around in the rest of it. And people always say to me, well,

149
00:09:16.561 --> 00:09:20.160
Dave, why don't you go on CNN and MSNBC? And I'm like, well,

150
00:09:20.161 --> 00:09:21.120
they don't invite me.

151
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.360
<v 0>What's the point? Yeah.</v>

152
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.130
<v 2>Well, well, I guess what's the point also nobody's watching, but, but you know,</v>

153
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.130
they don't invite me. I can't just show up. I actually have shown up.

154
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:31.993
<v 0>Point.</v>

155
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.080
If you think you're not going to be allowed to just be yourself and express your

156
00:09:36.081 --> 00:09:37.460
views and have that respected.

157
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.350
<v 2>Yeah. But, but the meme would be, Oh, Fox news is just pushing out,</v>

158
00:09:42.351 --> 00:09:43.640
talking points to everybody.

159
00:09:43.641 --> 00:09:46.820
But I just know it's not true because you guys let me say whatever I want.

160
