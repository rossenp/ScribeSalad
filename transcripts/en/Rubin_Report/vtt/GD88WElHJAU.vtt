1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.140
<v 0>If you look at Seattle,</v>

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.700
they had the most radical member of the city council box about getting visas.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.110
Now Jesus is the richest guy in the world, Susan obvious,

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.423
targeted they're socialists.

5
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.990
But if you want to drive Amazon out of

6
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.340
King County and Seattle, you want to look at them. You know,

7
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:24.090
this is what AOC did when she blocked them from going into her congressional

8
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:28.830
district and cost that part of New York city when he 5,000 jobs.

9
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.360
And I don't think this will not surprise me one morning. Uh,

10
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.670
visas announced that Amazon was moving everything out of Seattle and the cost of

11
00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:43.350
the tax both directly from Amazon and indirectly from all the

12
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:46.620
workers who would then leave would be just staggering. I mean,

13
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.990
it would turn into, it would turn Seattle into Detroit.

14
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.530
<v 1>So with all this in mind, what do you think the Republicans, if anything,</v>

15
00:00:57.531 --> 00:01:00.500
could be doing better as we're watching monuments,

16
00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:04.910
being taken down and we're watching the mob just run across cities.

17
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.291
Um, you know,

18
00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:09.170
I see the Republicans are sort of talking a tough game and Trump's talking a

19
00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:09.890
tough game, but,

20
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.880
but are they not doing something that they actually should be doing because this

21
00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:15.110
stuff isn't stopping?

22
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.960
<v 0>Well, look, I think there are a couple of things they should be doing.</v>

23
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.970
First of all, in the long run,

24
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.860
they should the Republican national committee to go into every major city and

25
00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:28.790
create a jobs prosperity and safety

26
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.403
chapter,

27
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.720
and start to organize everybody in the city to win municipal elections and

28
00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:39.080
state legislative elections who are secondary thing people killed.

29
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.310
And then they ought to plant a flag in every one of these cities and say,

30
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.880
we're going to reach out to everybody. Who's secondary to having no jobs,

31
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.360
no schools that work they have and having your relative shot.

32
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.930
And if that fits you, let's sit down and talk about, you know,

33
00:01:53.931 --> 00:01:55.580
how you can be accounted. Not, not,

34
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.920
we're not going to ask you to vote for some traditional Republican,

35
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.960
but we're going to try to help you take back your city. Second, I think, um,

36
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.150
that the president has to look at the example that Bobby Kennedy

37
00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:10.460
set in the early eighties and the early sixties

38
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.700
when young of volunteers were being killed in Mississippi during the civil

39
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:17.534
rights move.

40
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.530
And it was clear that the local sheriff who may have been doing the killing and

41
00:02:21.531 --> 00:02:24.170
the state police were not going to defend these people.

42
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.590
And what they did is they said, look, these are American citizens.

43
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.300
And if you're not going to defend them, we are. And they sat in the FBI.

44
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.290
And I think in a number of these places that the young woman in Indianapolis,

45
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:37.370
the mother of a three-year-old,

46
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.780
who was apparently shot over the weekend for saying all lives matter.

47
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.690
Um, you know,

48
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.160
th there's a perfect example where she lost all of her civil rights cause she's

49
00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:54.110
dead. Uh, I think they ought to say, you know,

50
00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:58.370
we, we are now going to create strike forces that are going to be prepared to go

51
00:02:58.371 --> 00:03:03.010
into the South of Chicago, prepared to go into New York, any place which has,

52
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.550
is clearly spinning out of control. If you,

53
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:08.620
if you won't protect your own citizens,

54
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.350
we will because they're American citizens.

55
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:13.750
And I think we have to be prepared to,

56
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.100
to be much more aggressive and much tougher, uh, about, uh,

57
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.180
taking this on. And then lastly, we ought to create much bigger, uh,

58
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.890
and more attractive opportunities zones, uh, with, uh, benefits.

59
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:31.300
So great. And with, with education opportunities. So great. Uh,

60
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:33.850
though we can actually begin to create jobs in the inner city,

61
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.200
everywhere in the country.

62
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.820
<v 1>Are you worried with all that in mind that this,</v>

63
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.830
this mix between COVID and riots and protests is going to do sort

64
00:03:43.831 --> 00:03:46.890
of irreparable damage to small business across the board?

65
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.480
No matter what at this point,

66
00:03:48.481 --> 00:03:53.190
because if you weren't taken out by COVID and now again, with the lockdowns,

67
00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:57.500
if you somehow survived, I have a friend who called me yesterday. Who's a,

68
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.210
who's, she's a misuse. She usually goes to people's homes.

69
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.980
She can't go to people's homes anymore.

70
00:04:01.981 --> 00:04:04.350
She got a little shop over the last couple of weeks,

71
00:04:04.351 --> 00:04:05.580
just a little one-room place.

72
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.000
Now they closed her down and she's thinking of leaving California now.

73
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:11.010
And she's not even sure what she's going to do for a living anymore.

74
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.590
That the average person, you know,

75
00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:16.380
the corporations can basically deal with these big blows,

76
00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:21.270
but the average person just can't figure out a way to live if every month

77
00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:22.380
something crazy is going to have.

78
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.150
<v 0>Well, I mean, even big corporations, Brooks brothers, Suzanne, which is a,</v>

79
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.180
you know, almost 200 year old company, uh, may,

80
00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:35.850
may actually be 200 years old, uh, as filed for bankruptcy, right? Uh,

81
00:04:35.851 --> 00:04:39.750
United airlines. I mean, even really big places can get in trouble,

82
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.800
but the point you make is important at a couple of levels.

83
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.110
I work very closely, uh, with Alfredo Ortiz and the job creators network. And,

84
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.400
um, they do terrific work helping small businesses,

85
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.670
and we have been much more proactive than the Europeans.

86
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.500
They're trying to help small businesses.

87
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.930
But I think one of the things you're going to see is people are going to

88
00:05:03.931 --> 00:05:07.530
leave. California. People are gonna leave big cities. Uh, I mean,

89
00:05:07.531 --> 00:05:11.610
I would not be at all surprised to see New York moves virtually everybody who

90
00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:15.030
has any resources, uh, just because the taxes are too high,

91
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.930
the streets will be in to be unsafe again. Uh, you know, people,

92
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.390
people don't want to be in a place that's out of control.

93
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.980
If you look at Seattle,

94
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.510
they had the most radical member of the city council box about getting visas.

95
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.060
Now Jesus is the richest guy in the world, Susan obvious, targeted a socialist.

96
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.800
But if you want to drive Amazon out of

97
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.180
King County and Seattle, you want to look at them. You know,

98
00:05:42.181 --> 00:05:45.930
this is what AOC did when she blocked them from going into her congressional

99
00:05:45.931 --> 00:05:50.640
district and cost that part of New York city when he 5,000 jobs.

100
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.200
And I don't think this mean we're not surprised me one morning. Uh,

101
00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.500
visas announced that Amazon was moving everything out of Seattle and the cost of

102
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:05.180
the tax both directly from Amazon and indirectly from all the

103
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:08.450
workers who would then leave would be just staggering. I mean,

104
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:10.820
it would turn them that would turn Seattle into Detroit.

105
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.150
<v 1>All right. So let's, let's back up a little bit, cause I know we can,</v>

106
00:06:16.151 --> 00:06:18.730
we can sort of focus on this for, for the entire hour,

107
00:06:18.731 --> 00:06:20.980
but I think your career's sorta, well, we can,

108
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.780
we can do several hours on this easily,

109
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.490
but I think your career in some of the things that you have done might help sort

110
00:06:27.491 --> 00:06:30.300
of light away that we can get out of some of this stuff. So when,

111
00:06:30.301 --> 00:06:31.750
when you were speaker of the house,

112
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:37.450
can you just talk a little bit about how Democrats and Republicans could or

113
00:06:37.451 --> 00:06:42.310
could not work together and what you think has happened that has led us

114
00:06:42.311 --> 00:06:47.260
to just, I mean, there's virtually none of it now, um, how you were able to,

115
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.190
to make some of those fights and,

116
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:51.970
and build some of those bridges or have some of those bridges burned?

117
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.640
<v 0>Well, I would point out that in fact, when the crisis really hit the spring,</v>

118
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.190
uh, the house and Senate did manage.

119
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:03.460
Now give Steve Minutian certainly the treasury, some real credit,

120
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.050
but the house and Senate actually worked together and produced trillions of

121
00:07:08.051 --> 00:07:11.980
dollars in spending. I mean, that was, they did it pretty fast.

122
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.420
They did it pretty cleanly.

123
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.980
They also has been a steady stream of small bills that people can get together

124
00:07:17.981 --> 00:07:20.380
and agree on Lamar Alexander.

125
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.940
The Senator from Tennessee is probably the best example that he's a genius at

126
00:07:24.941 --> 00:07:29.290
figuring out what they can do rather than what, what they can't do. Um,

127
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.730
but the key to, uh, we did, uh,

128
00:07:33.731 --> 00:07:36.160
was very explicit and people want to know about it.

129
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.030
I can read a very simple small book, uh,

130
00:07:39.031 --> 00:07:43.330
by Tom Evans called the educational Ronald Reagan, uh,

131
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:48.070
Reagan had, uh, after his movie career and his TV career,

132
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:53.440
he ended up spending eight years working for general electric. And, uh,

133
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.710
it was really interesting story because he went around the country as a

134
00:07:56.711 --> 00:08:01.120
spokesperson. He talked even about 375 speeches to factories.

135
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.500
So we have a lot of practice talking to blue collar workers, taking questions,

136
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.390
being a celebrity, um, which was great preparation for running for governor.

137
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.650
And in the process, Reagan was in a period where he wouldn't fly an airplane.

138
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.160
He did a really bouncy flight in, I think, late 45.

139
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.490
So he did not fly an airplane again until 1965.

140
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.650
And so he went everywhere by train.

141
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.600
And the guy he worked for was a very conservative, uh, intellectual,

142
00:08:28.601 --> 00:08:33.250
the head of, uh, human relations and union relations at general electric.

143
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.310
And so this guy would give Reagan conservative economic books.

144
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.590
So here you have Reagan driving, you know,

145
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.550
riding across the country and a train reading, conservative economics,

146
00:08:42.551 --> 00:08:44.470
preparing his speeches. Well,

147
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.890
Reagan came up with a model which he really got from this particular guy,

148
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.930
which Reagan summarized in everyday language

149
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.360
by saying my job to shine the light on the American people.

150
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.110
So they will turn up the heat on Congress. Well,

151
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:05.790
what that meant was you had to have a program like three-year tax cuts that was

152
00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:10.710
popular enough that the American people would say to their congressmen.

153
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.660
I really want you to pass this.
