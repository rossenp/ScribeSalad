1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.110
<v 0>I like listen to like NPR, BBC in your pants, like all one story.</v>

2
00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:06.600
Like why did they even have different, like publications,

3
00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:09.930
if they want to have a one narrative, they should just make it one channel.

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.870
Like North Korea so much easier for people to follow.

5
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.200
And I think it just,

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.890
it just reminds me of like the animal farm,

7
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.030
how it all began and the beginning just like, don't think, Oh,

8
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.880
it's not a big deal. It doesn't affect my life right now.

9
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.620
And then suddenly like, you start keeping big being purged and being executed.

10
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.040
And we are not in this state where like, we are executed, but like,

11
00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:39.030
you literally get cancer and you don't like news platform, social media,

12
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.770
like you lose your voice.

13
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.340
And that is almost like similar execution for like activists like me.

14
00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:47.310
Like if I lose my people, like my influence,

15
00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:51.120
then I cannot let them know the truth. Right. How do I ever find the system?

16
00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.600
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

17
00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.991
<v 2>Where like,</v>

18
00:00:59.991 --> 00:01:03.770
just where we're at in America and forgetting the election just generally, like,

19
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.730
you know, you mentioned some,

20
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.740
some of the negative things that have happened to you,

21
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.610
but obviously something truly incredible things have happened to you at the same

22
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:11.444
time.

23
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.610
<v 0>So yeah,</v>

24
00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:17.870
I've been also starting my YouTube channel and like I was doing live and talk

25
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:22.640
about how pure socialism can, can be so poisonous can never work. And of course,

26
00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:26.750
I'm sure, you know, like YouTube [inaudible] videos. Right.

27
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.380
And I was wondering like, how,

28
00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:34.370
like any ideas should be offered debate. I thought that's what,

29
00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:35.690
what freedom meant.

30
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.600
And here we have this like of like where we have to. I mean,

31
00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:42.020
I went to Columbia in New York.

32
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.340
You can how it felt like for me going through another four years of oppression

33
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.070
there, like, they talk about pressure by men,

34
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.560
but there's another oppression that they cannot see.

35
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.150
And I think that's why I just don't know like how, even to fire,

36
00:01:56.151 --> 00:02:01.070
I feel like I came to America like four or five years ago. And like, well,

37
00:02:01.071 --> 00:02:03.650
you guys always like, it's crazy. Like how this.

38
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.970
<v 2>No, we weren't. I promise you, we weren't always this crazy,</v>

39
00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:11.660
but we need people like you to, to help us find the way again. I mean,

40
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:13.610
that's why I wanted to have you on the show because you've,

41
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.790
you've lived through this stuff. You've lived through it.

42
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:18.110
And then when I saw the video and you're,

43
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.770
and you're somehow referencing my book and I'm going, this, this is crazy.

44
00:02:21.771 --> 00:02:23.280
I mean, you you've lived through it.

45
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.060
I'm talking about this stuff at the idea level.

46
00:02:26.061 --> 00:02:30.110
Although I fear that most of the things that I was worried about in the book are

47
00:02:30.111 --> 00:02:31.070
starting to become true.

48
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.790
<v 0>Yeah. It's uh, I mean on TV,</v>

49
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:38.360
I didn't get robbed and seeing people how they're like, you know,

50
00:02:38.361 --> 00:02:41.420
this is something you did read, like on the like conspiracy theory,

51
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:45.230
like new sites. These people were standing on the Michigan Avenue in Chicago,

52
00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:49.850
like two, 2:00 PM. Like during the day near the Macy and whiskers are nearby.

53
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.530
And this people are seeing me being punched and calling me racist because they

54
00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:57.620
only see what I think they could see. It was a color in their eyes.

55
00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.090
The other group, I was like Asian, that's all.

56
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.690
And that's when I thought like, Oh, this is like, not,

57
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:08.890
it's not like I'm trying to on people. This is a complete gong madness.

58
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.080
And I don't even know how to go back to the,

59
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:14.590
like the meter zone where some sanity like whores.

60
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.190
<v 2>Yeah. You, you sort of referenced this a little while ago,</v>

61
00:03:17.191 --> 00:03:21.690
but the idea that if you talk about these things, freedom,

62
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.870
free speech, all of the things that you've just described here.

63
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.340
But if you talk about them,

64
00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:30.930
you're suddenly thought of as like right wing that this is now a right

65
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.823
wing thing.

66
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.080
How has that affected your ability to do your advocacy and

67
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.000
build bridges and things like that?

68
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.730
<v 0>That's the thing it's so, so hard.</v>

69
00:03:41.731 --> 00:03:45.720
Like how they are just so easy to call him names now. Right? It's,

70
00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:46.680
they're so busy,

71
00:03:46.681 --> 00:03:51.270
like making few new names for people and then putting them into this little box.

72
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.360
And it's been very challenged, like actually doing these,

73
00:03:54.361 --> 00:03:57.630
like all my friends were like, you are fighting for notice, can people,

74
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.450
you can not doing this. You can not talk about any of this problems.

75
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.980
Just stick with North Korea.

76
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.830
But like in order to North Korea and we serve those,

77
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.700
I need to like solve a China. First, the problem of North Korea,

78
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.840
the root is Chinese regime. Like Colin's party is not Kim Jong-un Kim.

79
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.200
John can never sell by me one day. He does this in pain.

80
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.970
So I'm how do I like fight with massive fight without like letting people know

81
00:04:20.971 --> 00:04:23.910
what's happening and what China is doing to the humanity.

82
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.260
And then as soon as I,

83
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.940
of course criticize mainstream media for not like highlighting this issue,

84
00:04:29.941 --> 00:04:33.990
then you know, I'm becoming a white, extreme, like quiz person.

85
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.740
<v 2>What do you think about our media here? So as someone that grew up with,</v>

86
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.240
as you said, one channel our media,

87
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.290
our mainstream media kind of feels like one channel at a certain level.

88
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.440
<v 0>I mean, it is the one channel it's, uh, I, I just,</v>

89
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.950
I can't, I mean, I like listen to like NPR, BBC in your pants,

90
00:04:55.951 --> 00:04:59.820
like all one story. Like, why do they even have different, like publications?

91
00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:03.150
If they want to have a one narrative, they should just make it one channel.

92
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.090
Like North Korea so much easier for people to follow.

93
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.390
And I think it just,

94
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.110
it just reminds me of like the animal farm,

95
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.250
how it all began and the being just like, don't thinking, Oh,

96
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.100
it's not a big deal. It doesn't affect my life right now.

97
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.840
And then suddenly like, you start keeping big being perched and being executed.

98
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.260
And we are not in this state where like, we are executed, but like,

99
00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:32.280
you literally get cancer and you don't like news platform, social media,

100
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.990
like you lose your voice.

101
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.560
And that is almost like similar execution for like activist, like me.

102
00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:40.530
Like if I lose my people, like my influence,

103
00:05:40.531 --> 00:05:44.340
then I can not let them know the truth. Right. How do I ever find the system?

104
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.780
And like, my like fight is depending on the tech companies,

105
00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:50.880
they are decision on me like one day, like, Oh,

106
00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:53.610
I can let her be heard and I can be heard. But if they decide,

107
00:05:53.611 --> 00:05:57.440
I cannot be heard, I cannot be heard. It's not up to me anymore. That's like,

108
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.620
what? Just fixing my within, like, how am I despite.

109
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.751
<v 2>Yeah. You know,</v>

110
00:06:01.751 --> 00:06:05.140
it's interesting when people ask me what I love most about doing the show,

111
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.480
it's this right now, because think about like,

112
00:06:07.481 --> 00:06:10.510
our lives are so different came from such different places.

113
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.730
And the things that you care about are the exact things that I care about. Like,

114
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.710
it's actually incredible how these sort of eternal ideas just end up bringing us

115
00:06:20.711 --> 00:06:21.544
together.

116
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.560
<v 0>Yeah, it does. I mean, I think it's, it's freedom is something that we can,</v>

117
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.270
I think that's what I'm so like, scared for going to Columbia is like,

118
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.770
they don't understand like, like people when you're born with like two arms,

119
00:06:35.771 --> 00:06:38.320
you never know what it feels like living without two arms.

120
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.370
And these people like at Columbia keep like wondering about what would it be

121
00:06:42.371 --> 00:06:43.750
like without like freedom.

122
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.800
Like they have no clue what it's going to be without it. And they're keeping,

123
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.760
trying to experiment with this new idea. And there's like, no,

124
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.260
I know what it feels like living without this like rights and freedom and why I

125
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.810
trying to keep abandon them. They,

126
00:06:58.811 --> 00:07:02.530
our ancestors fall from freedom of speech and like,

127
00:07:02.531 --> 00:07:06.260
they bloody blow the four freedoms now for there was a price they paid for.

128
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.410
And now, because they got it for free,

129
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.900
this is a one to see what it feels like without two arms.

130
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.830
And it's not that great, like it's, your life is going to be so miserable.

131
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.420
And I think that's like,

132
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.920
what chucks me and horrifies me how ignorant and

133
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.630
this evil, this like ignorant Ida is. Can you also talk about.

134
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.970
<v 2>A little bit about how it's not just like the,</v>

135
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.370
the bad actors that spread these ideas,

136
00:07:30.371 --> 00:07:33.340
but how the average person just kind of gives up,

137
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.730
like what you saw in North Korea when you were a kid and then China,

138
00:07:36.731 --> 00:07:40.060
when you were a little bit older about how the average person just sort of

139
00:07:40.061 --> 00:07:44.200
checks out. Cause that seems to be the stage that we're in right now here.

140
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:50.170
<v 0>So yeah, I was thinking like, so in North Korea, if you commit a crime,</v>

141
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.430
it doesn't end with you. Like it tracks two, three generations of your family,

142
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:59.410
sometimes eight generation, which means like you, your in-laws have cousins,

143
00:07:59.411 --> 00:08:04.090
cousins like that. So one like the factory skateboards. Hi, hi lover.

144
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.140
He's like to read, I mean, 30,000 people got pushed for that.

145
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.940
And like, usually it's three generations. So your grandpa, your children,

146
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:16.750
all of it. And like any in America. Now, if there's like,

147
00:08:16.751 --> 00:08:21.010
if I say something that was maybe completely aware, 30 years ago,

148
00:08:21.011 --> 00:08:22.900
it gets back to me and I don't know,

149
00:08:22.901 --> 00:08:26.170
what's going to get back to me three years down the road and how it's going to

150
00:08:26.171 --> 00:08:27.130
affect my son.

151
00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:30.610
Like people are talking about something that happened in the like timed

152
00:08:30.611 --> 00:08:33.580
ancestral age, and they have to be responsible for that.

153
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.390
But this slavery thing that is like, exactly reminds me of that. Like,

154
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.900
because some, my accessory data so many, many lifetime ago,

155
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.260
how does it affect me? How does it make me figure it? Right?

156
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.690
And this is a complete idea from North Korea.

157
00:08:46.691 --> 00:08:48.490
I don't know where these ideas are coming from.

158
00:08:48.491 --> 00:08:51.940
Like we're making people so guilty and shame them.

159
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.830
And that's what North Korea is all about.

160
00:08:53.831 --> 00:08:57.120
Shaming people and make them security and punish them.

161
00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:01.820
