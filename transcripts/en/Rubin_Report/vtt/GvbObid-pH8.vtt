00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.860
<v 0>He's the kind of person we should listen to.</v>

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.660
There's a reason he Rose in such a popularity because people are resonating with

3
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:10.020
his ideas. Now, even if I don't, I can at least recognize, well,

4
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:12.180
here's a voice maybe I should pay attention to.

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.560
I might learn something from him.

6
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.340
<v 1>That line in the sand that we both want drawn.</v>

7
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.090
It seems impossible for liberals to do at a systemic level,

8
00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:32.810
meaning the individuals we've talked about this many times that I believe

9
00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:34.250
individuals can do it,

10
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.020
but it seems like systems based on that seem unable to, uh,

11
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.370
unable to stand up to it.

12
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.980
So I thought this will be a great segue to talk about the,

13
00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:44.870
the differences that you have with Jordan Peterson.

14
00:00:44.871 --> 00:00:48.680
I thought I have to read actually the blurb that Jordan wrote on the back of the

15
00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:51.650
book, because I've literally never seen, uh,

16
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.070
a statement like this written on the back of someone's book before,

17
00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:58.190
and that'll be a good launch point for us. So Jordan wrote,

18
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.830
this is a rather difficult book for me to blurb,

19
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.390
given that an entire chapter is devoted to criticizing my claims

20
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.010
about pragmatic truth vis-a-vis scientific truth. However,

21
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:14.630
Dr. Michael Shermer is a very clear thinker and the kind of skeptic that is

22
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.310
always necessary to ensure that the pub that public thought scientific and

23
00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:21.920
otherwise maintains a certain clarity.

24
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.660
He's a passionate advocate of free speech for this and many other reasons to the

25
00:01:26.661 --> 00:01:30.290
point of entitling his new book, giving the devil his due,

26
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.120
which is devoted to many worthwhile topics, but to free speech above all,

27
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.320
despite our disagreements, this is a necessary book for our times,

28
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.820
read it and thank God and the powers that be that you have the right to do so.

29
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.360
So I think it's sort of perfect because it's a summation of what we all know

30
00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:51.230
about Jordan. Um, but the fact that you asked him to do it,

31
00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:56.210
despite having a chapter in here, which grapples with all of his ideas. Um,

32
00:01:56.211 --> 00:01:59.210
and I do think this is sort of linked to the question that I'm asking you about

33
00:01:59.211 --> 00:01:59.841
liberalism.

34
00:01:59.841 --> 00:02:03.800
So can you sort of unpack what your similarities and differences are with

35
00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:04.634
Jordan?

36
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.620
<v 0>Yeah, I think, uh, you know,</v>

37
00:02:06.621 --> 00:02:10.880
when I first saw Jordan on your show and Joe show and sorry, who is this guy?

38
00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:14.000
You know, like everybody else, like who is this guy? Uh, to me,

39
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:16.430
I was dying to know what it is. He thought about things.

40
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.790
Although at the same time I could see mostly liberals again,

41
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.790
trying to shut him down or call him Hitler, whatever.

42
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:26.720
I mean a bigot and a misogynist and whatnot. And then when I met him,

43
00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:29.510
I thought this guy is a super good guy. I mean, I,

44
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.200
I could see why I don't agree with him on this and that, but you know,

45
00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:35.090
he's the kind of person we should listen to.

46
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.920
There's a reason he Rose in such a popularity because people are resonating with

47
00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:43.280
his ideas. Now, even if I don't, I can at least recognize, well,

48
00:02:43.281 --> 00:02:45.440
here's a voice maybe I should pay attention to.

49
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.110
I might learn something from him. And, uh,

50
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.390
so the two chapters at the end of the book,

51
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.610
that chapter on Jordan and the chapter on Graham Hancock,

52
00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:56.240
who I was on Joe Rogan's podcast with, and then I got to know, it's like, okay,

53
00:02:56.241 --> 00:02:57.920
this guy is an alternative archeologist.

54
00:02:57.921 --> 00:03:01.510
He has some ideas that most archeologists think are crazy, are way out there,

55
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.130
uh, not substantiated. And, uh, and yet he makes a pretty good arguments.

56
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:08.620
He's a great writer. And, you know, from there,

57
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:12.810
I think this is the kind of people we got to give a voice to and, and,

58
00:03:12.811 --> 00:03:14.770
and acknowledge that, you know,

59
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.590
maybe we don't have time to listen to every single person out there, but,

60
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:18.160
you know,

61
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.970
pick and choose the ones that are very popular because they must be saying

62
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:25.330
something that resonates with people. Now Jordan's theory of truth. You know,

63
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:29.710
it's sort of a blend of Charles Darwin and William James sort of a pragmatic

64
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.510
evolutionary pragmatism. And I don't want to misquote his, his theory.

65
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:37.480
You can listen to four hours of him and Sam kind of hashing this out.

66
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.950
It goes on for that long and, and his books, uh, of deconstruct all that.

67
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.480
But near, as I could tell, it would be something like, um, you know, if, if,

68
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.620
if you believe it's true and it, and it works pragmatically speaking, then,

69
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.360
then you can use the word truth to it. And I think it comes down to,

70
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:56.890
what do you mean by that? Like,

71
00:03:56.891 --> 00:04:01.060
so was Jesus resurrected from the dead now? You know,

72
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:05.200
most Christians today say yes, absolutely. You know,

73
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.510
someone named Jesus existed,

74
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.650
he was crucified and he Rose from the dead and, you know,

75
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:14.530
a hundred billion people have lived and died before the seven and a half billion

76
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.520
people alive. Now not one of them is back from the dead except this one, maybe.

77
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.510
Okay. So that's the, that's the argument now from a skeptic's perspective,

78
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.120
I would say, well, that is an extraordinary claim.

79
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.510
How extraordinary a hundred billion to one extraordinary, right.

80
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.610
Is the evidence for it corresponding or in proportion to that hundred

81
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.500
billion to one odds. And, and the answer is no. And so I write about that, but,

82
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.790
but to Jordan,

83
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:43.630
I think he would say whether it happened or not is irrelevant,

84
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.270
it's mythically true or psychologically true.

85
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.150
That is you have a cross to bear.

86
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.740
You might say a burden to carry of the suffering of

87
00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:58.450
yourself and your family and friends or humanity or whatever forgiveness,

88
00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.841
you know,

89
00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:03.670
starting over this kind of resurrection of your own life to

90
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.250
rebuild. It's like the no-action flood story.

91
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.640
It's a story of sort of destruction and redemption.

92
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.740
It's a kind of a born again story.

93
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.940
So I think what Jordan is arguing is that has mythic power.

94
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.580
That is a kind of truth. Uh.

95
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.370
<v 1>But that's sort of like an eternal,</v>

96
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.880
an eternal truth underneath the empirical truth, something like that.

97
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.500
<v 0>Right, right. That's right.</v>

98
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.190
So it could be that people like me and Jordan or someone like maybe Richard

99
00:05:29.191 --> 00:05:32.160
Dawkins in Jordan or whoever that's kind of an empiricist,

100
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.000
they're just talking to two different levels. I think, uh, you know,

101
00:05:36.001 --> 00:05:37.650
Jordan's not always super clear about this,

102
00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:40.500
so you have to kind of read what he said here or there or whatever,

103
00:05:40.501 --> 00:05:44.250
but I think that's, what's going on. And so to the extent that, uh, you know,

104
00:05:44.251 --> 00:05:48.270
he likes to quote young and, and Freud and Nietzsche and, and,

105
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.860
and Tolstoy and so on. And it's like Shakespeare Jane Austin.

106
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.800
The reason this is great literature is because it's tapping about the

107
00:05:57.801 --> 00:06:02.570
reality of human nature, human relationships, societies, conflict,

108
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.310
power struggles, sex, and gossip, and, you know,

109
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.800
conflict and violence war.

110
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.680
Those are all realities that everybody knows.

111
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:15.680
And these great novelists can tap into that.

112
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.940
There's a whole study now of evolutionary literary sort of evolutionary

113
00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:22.940
psychology of literature, where they kind of, they,

114
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.230
they do a content analysis of great works to see which kind of themes come up

115
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.220
over and over and over. And they're the deepest themes that we all care about.

116
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:35.210
Again, that the sort of hierarchy, social status, power,

117
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.050
deception, honesty, love, sex, all that.

118
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.120
And so there,

119
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:44.600
I think what Jordan is arguing that I would agree with that there are truths

120
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.170
there now that's a good, but that's different than an empirical truth. Like,

121
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.000
so the analogy I make is like,

122
00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:53.840
people will often send me as the editor of skeptic magazine articles explaining

123
00:06:53.841 --> 00:06:56.450
what really happened with the flood. You know, you know,

124
00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.870
meteor Stryker was a volcano eruption, not the flood,

125
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.410
like the parting of the red sea se, but the flood also,

126
00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:05.780
or the Jew Jesus was on the cross.

127
00:07:05.781 --> 00:07:09.350
And then somebody gave him this chemical through the rag and that put him into a

128
00:07:09.351 --> 00:07:13.460
coma and then they put him in the tomb and then he woke up and then his

129
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:16.450
disciples wisdom off to France. Yeah.

130
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.200
And he married Mary Magdalene and they had kids and, and, and,

131
00:07:19.201 --> 00:07:22.340
and the bloodline is still around. This was of course Dan Brown's novel.

132
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.490
That was a real book actually before Dan Brown was a book called Holy blood,

133
00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:27.890
Holy grail. And they actually,

134
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.950
those guys sued Dan Brown for stealing their idea. He's like,

135
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.030
it's a novel dudes. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

136
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.030
He sold so many books, man. If, if, if you don't sell any books,

137
00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:40.730
no one's going to Sue you because there's no money. Right. So it was,

138
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.040
it was kind of like there, you saw the difference, you know, Dan,

139
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.100
Dan Brown's novel resonated. Cause it's, it's just a story.

140
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.910
He's not claiming it's empirically true. But these guys, the Holy blood,

141
00:07:49.911 --> 00:07:52.520
Holy grail authors, um, that, you know, they were saying, no, no, this,

142
00:07:52.521 --> 00:07:54.410
this really happened. Okay.

143
00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:58.100
So those are two different ways of saying really happened or truth, you know?

144
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.550
<v 1>So do you think it's possible that we need both of those?</v>

145
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.820
I think maybe that's the position that I've come around to,

146
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:11.170
that we need empirical truths. We need scientific truths. Absolutely.

147
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.010
But when you talk about that, that other layer that Jordan's talking about,

148
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:19.150
the sort of time-tested things about purpose and happiness and,

149
00:08:19.151 --> 00:08:21.520
and individualism and the drive to,

150
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:26.170
to accomplish what humans are sort of here to do that for me, I've come to,

151
00:08:26.171 --> 00:08:28.450
and this is, this is one of the spots. And when I was just on your show,

152
00:08:28.451 --> 00:08:30.460
you were, you were asking about, because I write about this in my book,

153
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.080
I've come to the place where for a society to organize itself properly,

154
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:39.640
it does need some other ethos beneath it. And what I,

155
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.050
I think is something like when you talk about Shakespeare and all the authors

156
00:08:44.051 --> 00:08:47.590
that write about these themes, too, that in and of themselves, those stories,

157
00:08:47.591 --> 00:08:51.460
aren't enough to organize a society around. Not that again,

158
00:08:51.461 --> 00:08:53.320
that individuals can't do it,

159
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.880
but for actually for a to function properly.

160
00:08:56.881 --> 00:08:58.710
Do you think there's some truth to that?

161
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.160
<v 0>Yeah, I do. For sure. I mean, there's a reason why, uh, drama,</v>

162
00:09:04.161 --> 00:09:08.510
films and television sells or has a much bigger

163
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.230
viewerships than documentary films. I mean, it's very rare.

164
00:09:12.231 --> 00:09:15.230
Any documentary film gets, you know, millions of views. There's a few,

165
00:09:15.231 --> 00:09:17.750
but not many. And, and, and the reason is,

166
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.070
is because we're storytelling animals and we're moved emotionally, deeply,

167
00:09:22.071 --> 00:09:26.690
psychologically moved by a story, you know, about some person now, like when,

168
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.650
uh, uh, Spielberg made Schindler's list. Um, you know,

169
00:09:30.651 --> 00:09:34.580
it's not a story of the Holocaust because that's too big a subject. I mean,

170
00:09:34.581 --> 00:09:38.630
you'd have, you could have like a Ken burns 13 part series on the Holocaust.

171
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.240
People have done this because there's so many stories instead,

172
00:09:41.241 --> 00:09:43.820
he just took one little story. Okay. This guy, Oscar Schindler,

173
00:09:43.821 --> 00:09:45.650
who was this guy, and, you know,

174
00:09:45.651 --> 00:09:50.540
Conneely wrote that novel about him sort of a semi true novel.

175
00:09:50.541 --> 00:09:53.630
Okay. So if you really look at it, it's not that interesting, the story,

176
00:09:53.631 --> 00:09:56.750
but when you bring it on the big screen and then you build in the Holocaust

177
00:09:56.751 --> 00:10:00.020
around that story, but it's the narrative thread that goes throughout.

178
00:10:00.021 --> 00:10:03.260
So all filmmakers know this. Most of us non-fiction writers.

179
00:10:03.261 --> 00:10:05.470
We don't understand, you got to have a narrative story. You know,

180
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.360
you got to have an arc to it, right. Poles, right. Roles,

181
00:10:08.361 --> 00:10:13.130
readers along good writers, do that. Uh, and filmic good filmmakers do that.

182
