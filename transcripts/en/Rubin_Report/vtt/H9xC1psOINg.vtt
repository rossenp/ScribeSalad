1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.740
<v 0>I'll be waiting late into the night. Hopefully we'll know the result that night.</v>

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.940
Cause the last thing I think we need is a case going to the court over the

3
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:13.710
election with the deciding vote being cast by a justice who was just appointed

4
00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:15.480
by one of the litigants to the Supreme court.

5
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.750
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

6
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.070
<v 2>And a quick on the fly interview today with the legendary lawyer legal</v>

7
00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:31.970
scholar and one of the last sane liberals around Alan Dershowitz.

8
00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:32.780
Welcome to the Rubin.

9
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.620
<v 0>Well, thanks. It's a pleasure to be on with another sane liberal.</v>

10
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.200
<v 2>There ain't many left.</v>

11
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.240
<v 0>Our next meeting in a phone booth.</v>

12
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.530
<v 2>There's about, there's about 10 of us left.</v>

13
00:00:45.531 --> 00:00:48.830
So I just said to you before we started that I I'd love to have you back for a

14
00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:51.440
full, extended hour long interview that I normally do.

15
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.940
I appreciate you jumping in today because of the Amy Coney Barrett, uh,

16
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.430
confirmation yesterday, just to clean up some of the,

17
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.030
some of the legal stuff I know we could complain about what's happened to the

18
00:01:02.031 --> 00:01:03.230
libs all day long, but,

19
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.600
but let's just talk about some legal stuff today and then we'll,

20
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:09.020
we'll pick up and do that, uh, in the next couple of weeks. Uh,

21
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:12.170
so first off she was confirmed yesterday. I, I suspect,

22
00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:16.550
although you probably don't agree with perhaps all of her past judicial

23
00:01:16.551 --> 00:01:21.140
decisions or some of her reasoning that you think that her being

24
00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:24.280
confirmed was the right decision. Is that too much of a leading.

25
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.120
<v 0>A little bit too much of a leading question? Okay.</v>

26
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.430
If the decision was going to be made, it was the right decision. That is,

27
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.440
she was highly qualified.

28
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.980
She is as qualified as Merrick Garland,

29
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.270
but Merrick Garland should have been confirmed as well.

30
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.760
So I object to the process.

31
00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:48.710
I think the Republicans stole a seat on the Supreme court from the Democrats,

32
00:01:48.711 --> 00:01:53.150
and that was improper back in, uh, 1990 in 2016,

33
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:57.440
that was wrong. And they established a precedent, which they didn't follow,

34
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.880
namely that if a nomination comes within months of an election,

35
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.120
it should be deferred. But passing that,

36
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.100
I basically agree with the vote that was made by the Senator for Alaska.

37
00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:11.660
She said she opposed the process,

38
00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:15.860
but she didn't want to take it out on a highly qualified justice. So yes,

39
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:17.960
she's highly qualified. No doubt about that.

40
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.601
<v 2>Right? When,</v>

41
00:02:19.601 --> 00:02:23.750
when we get into the hypocrisy game of what the Republicans did just a couple of

42
00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:24.830
years ago, and,

43
00:02:24.831 --> 00:02:28.280
and some of the things that the Democrats are saying there there's nobody that's

44
00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:29.114
innocent. Right?

45
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.400
<v 0>Right. At this point, it started with, um, Bork.</v>

46
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.920
Uh, we have a verb now to Bork somebody.

47
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.260
It then moved to abolishing the cloture and filibuster

48
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.250
first on all judges then on Supreme court justices.

49
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.020
And now of course this morning already AOC and others are

50
00:02:51.021 --> 00:02:53.240
demanding that the court be packed.

51
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.550
There's a big op-ed or in today's New York times a series of op-eds about how to

52
00:02:58.551 --> 00:03:00.700
fix the court. I mean,

53
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:05.470
the only thing broken about the court today essentially is that it is dominated

54
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:08.680
by conservatives. I don't think the people who wrote the app beds,

55
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.150
most of them would have tried to fix the court if the shoe were on the other

56
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:16.870
foot. And if it was six to three in favor of liberals,

57
00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:21.400
they only want to fix it because they want their ideology to dominate on the

58
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:22.234
court.

59
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.670
<v 2>So I'm curious back in 2013, when Harry Reed, you know,</v>

60
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.350
did the nuclear option. I was a lefty. I was a big liberal, I was a Democrat,

61
00:03:31.351 --> 00:03:33.540
the whole thing. And there is video on YouTube.

62
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.340
People can find it of me saying this is a bad move. It will be used against us.

63
00:03:38.341 --> 00:03:41.880
That's exactly what Mitch McConnell said back then. W what were you?

64
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.350
<v 0>Same thing. Same thing. Look,</v>

65
00:03:43.351 --> 00:03:47.250
I've always taken the view that I put the institution, the Supreme court,

66
00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:50.280
the country before partisan politics.

67
00:03:50.281 --> 00:03:54.900
That's what got me in trouble with so many of my so-called liberal friends who

68
00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:57.810
wouldn't understand a liberal if they fell over one, uh,

69
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.620
liberal friends who object to the fact that I defended the constitution.

70
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.770
When the house of representatives try to impeach president Trump,

71
00:04:04.771 --> 00:04:08.790
who I voted against in the 2016 election on

72
00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:11.100
unconstitutional grounds, uh,

73
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.140
I favor the constitution and institutional support for the Supreme

74
00:04:16.141 --> 00:04:19.320
court over any kind of ideological preference.

75
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.250
<v 2>Do you think that in normal times,</v>

76
00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:25.350
and I don't even know how to define that anymore,

77
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.420
that because we'd be talking more about ACBS, uh,

78
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.400
qualifications rather than the process.

79
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.120
She strikes me as the type of person that maybe maybe 30 years ago,

80
00:04:36.121 --> 00:04:39.600
let's say she probably would have got 70 votes or something like that.

81
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.810
Do you think that that's something like that's fair to say?

82
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.990
<v 0>I think 98 votes is Farragut. Say Scalia got votes and Scalia.</v>

83
00:04:45.991 --> 00:04:50.850
Didn't try to hide his views at all. Uh, justice Ginsburg got many,

84
00:04:50.851 --> 00:04:53.070
many, many votes. She didn't try to hide her views.

85
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.790
The tradition back in the day was that you,

86
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.330
you affirm somebody for the Supreme court, if they're highly qualified,

87
00:05:00.331 --> 00:05:04.890
that was broken for the first time with the Bork nomination, uh,

88
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.860
bark was extremely qualified. He was a professor at Yale.

89
00:05:07.861 --> 00:05:10.440
He was listen to general. He was a judge,

90
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.880
but he had extreme right-wing views and he didn't present them effectively. Um,

91
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.450
he made statements in front of the Senate, which really put a lot of people off,

92
00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:21.330
including a lot of Republicans. And so, uh,

93
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.170
he failed the confirmation process test,

94
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.730
but it turned into more of a principle. Look, when you get a court,

95
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.500
a Supreme court that doesn't affect the lives of ordinary people as the Supreme

96
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.750
court, didn't for the first a hundred years of its existence,

97
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.090
nobody cared who was on the Supreme court,

98
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.170
but when the Supreme court decides desegregation, as it should have Roe vs.

99
00:05:43.171 --> 00:05:46.290
Wade, uh, gay marriage, people are going to say,

100
00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:49.760
who are those roped people? What, what,

101
00:05:49.761 --> 00:05:53.130
why don't we get input into who is putting on the court?

102
00:05:53.131 --> 00:05:56.820
They're affecting our daily lives. So, you know, there's no free lunch.

103
00:05:56.821 --> 00:05:59.120
If want the Supreme court to be de-politicize,

104
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.230
then the Supreme court should stay away from making controversial divisible

105
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:06.110
decisions. If they're going to make controversial decisions,

106
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.220
then they're going to become politicized. That's what democracy is all about.

107
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.480
<v 2>I'm guessing that not much can shock you,</v>

108
00:06:13.481 --> 00:06:17.500
but is any of the language coming out of the Democrats right now,

109
00:06:17.501 --> 00:06:20.470
shocking to you in that there's basically just a,

110
00:06:20.471 --> 00:06:24.310
let's burn it all down feeling right now. Not just let's pack the courts,

111
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.980
but let's change the electoral college.

112
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.250
Let's change every institution that in many ways,

113
00:06:30.251 --> 00:06:33.490
someone like you has fought for your whole life to, to strengthen.

114
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.820
<v 0>Yeah, because they're not interested in changing the institutions.</v>

115
00:06:36.821 --> 00:06:39.100
They're interested in getting their way, um,

116
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.420
and whatever it takes to get their way they're prepared to do. Um,

117
00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.280
if the shoe were on the other foot, again,

118
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.110
they would be the strongest defenders of these various institutions. But they,

119
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.560
you know, there's an intolerance. It reflects itself on campuses today.

120
00:06:53.561 --> 00:06:57.880
Why do we need free speech? We know the truth. Why do we need due process?

121
00:06:57.881 --> 00:06:59.650
We know if a woman accuses a man,

122
00:06:59.651 --> 00:07:03.700
of course the woman's telling the truth and the man is guilty.

123
00:07:03.701 --> 00:07:08.290
Why do we need any of these processes? We know we know the truth.

124
00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:12.970
We're in doubt with this special ability to discern

125
00:07:12.971 --> 00:07:15.880
truth. And we don't need process. We don't need speech.

126
00:07:15.881 --> 00:07:19.420
We don't need due process. We don't need the Supreme court.

127
00:07:19.421 --> 00:07:22.390
We don't need the electoral college. We don't need anything.

128
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:27.370
Just give us the ability to rule and dictate and will dictate in the right

129
00:07:27.371 --> 00:07:32.140
way, said Stalin and Mao, and many of the students on college campuses today.

130
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.110
<v 2>So I'm curious with that in mind,</v>

131
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.530
I've been making an argument and I did not vote for Trump four years ago.

132
00:07:38.531 --> 00:07:41.380
I voted for Gary Johnson, but I am going to vote for Trump this time.

133
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.660
I've been making an argument that in an odd way,

134
00:07:43.661 --> 00:07:47.560
Trump is defending both liberalism and conservatism.

135
00:07:47.561 --> 00:07:49.840
At this point in that he's defending conservatism,

136
00:07:49.841 --> 00:07:54.520
that's obvious the judges and the policies are fairly conservative and he's

137
00:07:54.521 --> 00:07:57.610
defending liberalism because he's basically the last,

138
00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.800
the last door between the,

139
00:08:00.801 --> 00:08:03.880
the lefties just ramming through everything. Does,

140
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:07.660
does that make some kind of sense to you as bizarre as it sounds,

141
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.040
Trump is defending liberalism.

142
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.360
<v 0>And unintentionally.</v>

143
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:14.650
He's defending liberalism and many conservatives defend liberalism today because

144
00:08:14.651 --> 00:08:18.490
it's their ox. That's getting bored by the extreme left,

145
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.080
but remember I'm old enough.

146
00:08:20.081 --> 00:08:24.070
You're not to remember when it was the conservatives who were suppressing free

147
00:08:24.071 --> 00:08:27.580
speech on campus. I grew up during McCarthyism. And so,

148
00:08:27.581 --> 00:08:28.750
as you said in the beginning,

149
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.870
there's enough hypocrisy to go around on both sides.

150
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:36.100
What we need is a core of liberal centrist,

151
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.600
conservative centrists,

152
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:42.430
who have to work together to preserve institutions without regard

153
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.230
to what the outcome is.

154
00:08:44.231 --> 00:08:49.150
We have to be focused on process and fairness. It was Felix Frankfurter,

155
00:08:49.151 --> 00:08:52.900
the great justice who said the history of Liberty is primarily the history of

156
00:08:52.901 --> 00:08:55.830
process and procedure. If you that, right,

157
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.160
you're going to lose the outcome sometimes, but next time you'll win.

158
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.930
But if you change the process and eliminate due process and free speech

159
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:05.070
democracy is done.

160
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:10.190
<v 2>Do you think there's enough of those liberals of, of those centrists?</v>

161
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.190
Are there any left? I mean, we can joke about, you know,

162
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.160
there being about 10 of us, obviously there are other, you know,

163
00:09:16.161 --> 00:09:19.520
just good folks out there, but it seems like they've lost all power.

164
00:09:19.521 --> 00:09:23.600
I don't see any of them represented by the Democrats at the moment. I mean,

165
00:09:23.601 --> 00:09:24.434
where are they?

166
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.430
<v 0>Well, I think you're right.</v>

167
00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.020
I would have thought that Joe Biden would be one of the last of the

168
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.070
liberals, the centrist liberals. And I hope maybe he will be,

169
00:09:34.071 --> 00:09:38.960
but he has to resist the pressure from the squad and from the

170
00:09:38.961 --> 00:09:40.460
people on the extreme left look,

171
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:44.180
we're going to see a move toward court packing immediately.

172
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.330
And I know that Joe Biden doesn't want to pack the court.

173
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.610
And I know he won't push court packing,

174
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:54.410
but what if the Senate and the house passes court packing, will he veto it?

175
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.900
Does he have the courage to stand up against his own party, radicals and Vito?

176
00:09:59.901 --> 00:10:03.110
And I think that's the great question. And I agree with you.

177
00:10:03.111 --> 00:10:05.810
We need to build the center. We need to build, look,

178
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.090
I used to have these great debates with bill Buckley.

179
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.360
He was Sandra's conservatives. I'm a Senator as liberal.

180
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.180
You and I can have these debates,

181
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.720
but I can't have any discussions with anybody on Martha's vineyard.

182
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.690
I can't have discussions with members of my own family.

183
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.230
They just know the truth. They want the outcome they want.

184
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:28.010
And anything that stands in the way of that is fascism.

185
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.520
So I'm now asked just because I believe in due process.

186
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:34.640
<v 2>Hey, you're in good company. Um, all right.</v>

187
00:10:34.641 --> 00:10:38.000
So w w we'll obviously spend a lot more time talking about that in a separate

188
00:10:38.001 --> 00:10:40.910
interview, but, but I just let's dive into it a little bit more here,

189
00:10:40.911 --> 00:10:43.790
because I think a lot of people watching this, especially just, you know,

190
00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:46.100
basically a week before the election, at this point,

191
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:50.150
they're feeling that these are people who are lifetime, lifetime,

192
00:10:50.151 --> 00:10:51.350
moderate conservatives,

193
00:10:51.351 --> 00:10:54.350
or moderate liberals who now family members won't talk to them.

194
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.150
They're being pushed out of their communities.

195
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.600
And when do you remember as someone that's comes from the institutions that

196
00:10:59.601 --> 00:11:04.400
comes from Harvard that has been in the media game for decades, do you remember,

197
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.430
was there a moment that you saw that, that you got, Whoa,

198
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.320
this thing really is out of control?

199
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.213
<v 0>Yeah, I think,</v>

200
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:14.420
I think it really did come to fruition with the election of

201
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:19.070
Donald Trump who did reflect a division in the country. Look,

202
00:11:19.071 --> 00:11:21.080
there's still some place that people can go to.

203
00:11:21.081 --> 00:11:23.240
They can listen to you and they can listen to,

204
00:11:23.241 --> 00:11:25.640
I have a podcast now too called the dirt show.

205
00:11:25.641 --> 00:11:30.140
It's on the dirt and I not bad Dan for this position. I,

206
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:34.550
I always represent kind of the center liberal

207
00:11:34.551 --> 00:11:35.384
position,

208
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:39.590
never take positions on who should be elected or who should be appointed.

209
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:44.180
I talk about the implications of what's going on in America,

210
00:11:44.181 --> 00:11:48.140
and you can get it, you know, on Spotify or YouTube. So, you know,

211
00:11:48.141 --> 00:11:50.330
listen to you, listen to me, we'll link to it.

212
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:55.180
And I do think that podcasts and things like that are the wave of the

213
00:11:55.181 --> 00:12:00.010
future because look, Tate, look, what's going on today with Hunter Biden.

214
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.970
I I'm a liberal Democrat. I liked Joe Biden. I don't believe he's correct,

215
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:09.310
but NPR national public radio as now made a policy that they

216
00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:13.240
won't report on whether or not the laptop is genuine or not.

217
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.060
I want to know whether the laptop is genuine.

218
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:20.230
I want that to influence my vote one way or another.

219
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.130
Maybe it's not enough to change my current predisposition,

220
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:25.660
but I'm entitled to know.

221
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:29.740
And Twitter and Facebook and NPR are not entitled to keep that information from

222
00:12:29.741 --> 00:12:30.574
me.

223
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:35.730
<v 2>Are you shocked then at the way that the media has crumbled in,</v>

224
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:39.660
in conjunction with all of this, because you know, I'll see a lot of times when,

225
00:12:39.661 --> 00:12:42.990
when you go on CNN or, or now you go on Fox or whatever it might be.

226
00:12:42.991 --> 00:12:44.880
And by the way, Fox is the only one that puts.

227
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:47.850
<v 0>And ends and me as well. Yeah. Okay.</v>

228
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.610
<v 2>They banned new congratulations. But, but I see you when,</v>

229
00:12:50.611 --> 00:12:51.870
when you've gone on there,

230
00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.730
I suddenly see people who you've taught people that were your former colleagues,

231
00:12:56.731 --> 00:12:57.541
people that,

232
00:12:57.541 --> 00:13:01.140
that you might've even learned from who were suddenly going off on you in the,

233
00:13:01.141 --> 00:13:03.150
in the worst sort of ways. And,

234
00:13:03.151 --> 00:13:06.510
and usually have almost no legal backing behind what they're doing.

235
00:13:06.511 --> 00:13:08.460
And then you get layout of calm, legal precedent,

236
00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:12.630
but they're basically just calling you names. And I'm constantly amazed by that.

237
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.470
<v 0>True of Jeffrey Toobin and, and, you know, Jeffrey Toobin was my student.</v>

238
00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:19.830
And the point is Jeffrey Toobin has been wrong.

239
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:24.780
100% of the time when he's predicted the outcome of court decisions.

240
00:13:24.781 --> 00:13:26.520
And I've been right, a hundred percent of the time.

241
00:13:26.521 --> 00:13:31.440
It's not that I'm smarter than tubing it's that he allows ideology to influence

242
00:13:31.441 --> 00:13:34.620
his prediction. CNN tells him essentially how to come out,

243
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.020
because he doesn't want listeners to see it.

244
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.320
And to be upset that the Supreme court may come out in a way different from his

245
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:44.640
prediction. I don't care about that. And so I get it right,

246
00:13:44.641 --> 00:13:49.200
because I don't allow ideology to skew my predictions. I follow with Oliver.

247
00:13:49.201 --> 00:13:52.110
Wendell Holmes said the job of a lawyer is to predict, in fact,

248
00:13:52.111 --> 00:13:55.140
what the courts will do, not what the courts should do.

249
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.100
So tubing has gotten it wrong and I've asked CNN probably why I've been bad.

250
00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:02.340
I've been asking CNN show, tube ins predictions,

251
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:07.380
and then show what happened so that the listeners and the viewers can judge him

252
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:10.260
and decide whether to listen to what he has to say,

253
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.320
then show my predictions and show what happened. They,

254
00:14:13.321 --> 00:14:17.820
of course won't do that because people don't care really about the truth.

255
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.180
They only care about their truth, their capital T truth.

256
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.290
<v 2>So I know, I know that you might be in the legal prediction game,</v>

257
00:14:25.291 --> 00:14:27.900
but nobody wants to be in the political prediction game, you know,

258
00:14:27.901 --> 00:14:30.930
seven days out. But what do you think? I mean,

259
00:14:30.931 --> 00:14:32.130
what do you think is going to happen at this point?

260
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.970
<v 0>I can't predict I'm not in a position to make that judgment.</v>

261
00:14:35.971 --> 00:14:40.800
I did predict in 2016 in August that Trump may well win.

262
00:14:40.801 --> 00:14:43.440
And I told that to Hillary Clinton, who I was supporting,

263
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.130
cause I had just come back from Europe and I had seen the growth of populism

264
00:14:47.131 --> 00:14:51.120
Brexit, all that. And I saw a wave sweeping the world.

265
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.380
I thought it would sweep America as well. And I got that right.

266
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:59.270
But I don't know how to assess the polls. The polls show Biden ahead, obviously,

267
00:14:59.271 --> 00:15:02.870
but we know that there's a gap between polls and Trump voters,

268
00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:06.410
because there are a lot of Trump voters who won't tell pollsters the truth.

269
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:09.350
So I'll be waiting late into the night.

270
00:15:09.351 --> 00:15:11.960
Hopefully we'll know the result that night,

271
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.130
because the last thing I think we need is a case going to the court over the

272
00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:18.260
election with the deciding vote,

273
00:15:18.261 --> 00:15:22.070
being cast by a justice who was just appointed by one of the litigants to the

274
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:23.960
Supreme court. So I hope we avoid that.

275
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.080
<v 2>Right. But doesn't it seem in,</v>

276
00:15:26.081 --> 00:15:30.370
in a bizarre way that that is sort of almost where we have to end up now that

277
00:15:30.371 --> 00:15:33.790
the world has gotten so crazy and that, you know, I keep telling people,

278
00:15:33.791 --> 00:15:37.540
it feels like we're in the odd stage of democracy where it's now just the show

279
00:15:37.541 --> 00:15:38.321
must go on.

280
00:15:38.321 --> 00:15:42.790
We just need the show in an odd way to keep us all focused on that,

281
00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.280
that it would ultimately lead us to,

282
00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:48.820
to taking this to the Supreme court because in a bizarre sense, that's the show.

283
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.920
<v 0>Well, if it goes to the Supreme court,</v>

284
00:15:50.921 --> 00:15:55.690
I hope that whoever loses will do what Al Gore did and what Richard Nixon

285
00:15:55.691 --> 00:16:00.310
did and concede defeat and have peaceful transition,

286
00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.860
uh, let's hope that happens. Uh,

287
00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:08.320
I think there's some possibility the election may be decided on that night

288
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:13.270
if Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, all go for one candidate,

289
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.520
that will probably be the winning candidate.

290
00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.970
<v 2>All right. Let me ask you one other thing for now. And then we will,</v>

291
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.490
we will pick this up in the next couple of weeks for the,

292
00:16:21.491 --> 00:16:24.820
so I get that on the left. There's this burn it down feeling,

293
00:16:24.821 --> 00:16:28.270
and they want to change all of the norms, but what I'm also seeing now,

294
00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:28.991
as I've been,

295
00:16:28.991 --> 00:16:32.380
let's say more welcomed on the right is there's a version of that on the right

296
00:16:32.381 --> 00:16:33.740
as well, which is, Oh, well the,

297
00:16:33.741 --> 00:16:38.320
the lefties are so bananas and the institutions have failed us at such a level

298
00:16:38.321 --> 00:16:41.470
that we also should burn it all down. I'm not,

299
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.400
I'm not a full burn it all down guy. Right? I,

300
00:16:44.401 --> 00:16:47.260
I want to keep some of those things for the reasons you just laid out there.

301
00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:50.830
What would you say to the conservatives? Who,

302
00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:54.700
who now hold that position? Or especially if Trump loses who at that point,

303
00:16:54.701 --> 00:16:56.920
they're all gonna say, all right, they wanted to burn it.

304
00:16:56.921 --> 00:16:58.600
Well now we'll show them who's boss.

305
00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:01.860
<v 0>Well, I've already commented on that with Lindsey Graham,</v>

306
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:05.920
who I liked as a person, uh, Lindsey Graham said, look, uh,

307
00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:09.340
I'm never going to allow a nomination at the Supreme court to come within a year

308
00:17:09.341 --> 00:17:12.040
of an election and you can use my words against me.

309
00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:14.770
So they used his words against them. And he said, no, no, no, no, no.

310
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:19.780
The rules changed after what they did to the prior,

311
00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:24.520
uh, justice, uh, to cabinet. And they raised all these fake issues about,

312
00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:28.810
you know, his 15 year old. And he said, I'm going to burn it down. Basically.

313
00:17:28.811 --> 00:17:31.990
He didn't use the words, burned it down, but I'm going to change the rules.

314
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.160
I don't think that's right.

315
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:37.840
I don't think you fight dirty politics with dirty politics. Uh,

316
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:42.520
and I hope that if whoever wins continues to play by the rules,

317
00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:47.680
none of us will gain by a burning it down mentality because you know who

318
00:17:47.681 --> 00:17:50.190
they're going to burn down. They going to burn us down.

319
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.800
We're going to be the guys who they burned down.

320
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:55.740
And if you think you're exempt from that, forget about it.

321
00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.570
Just remember the French revolution.

322
00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:01.560
Nobody could get far enough left to avoid being guillotine.

323
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:04.800
Even the people who thought they will leading the French revolution,

324
00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:09.180
ended up losing their heads when you have violence and riots.

325
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.920
And the kinds of lawlessness that I think both sides are capable of

326
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:18.420
engaging. And the losers are our democracy. So, you know,

327
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.250
get ready to lose,

328
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:24.390
whether you're a Democrat or Republican and then prepare to win next time.

329
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:28.920
That's the answer. Don't go to the streets and don't engage in violence.

330
00:18:28.921 --> 00:18:32.670
And I'm afraid we may have some violence following this election.

331
00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:34.140
And that's a great concern.

332
00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.340
<v 2>Yeah. Spoken like a true liberal.</v>

333
00:18:37.341 --> 00:18:39.350
And it's a guy that's a talking head for a living.

334
00:18:39.351 --> 00:18:43.880
I'd like to keep my head attached to my body. We shall see, all right,

335
00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:48.470
the dirt show is available on iTunes and YouTube and Spotify and everywhere that

336
00:18:48.471 --> 00:18:51.890
you can get podcasts and we'll get you back after the election. And we'll we'll.

337
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.650
<v 0>That would be wonderful. I had a great time talking to you.</v>

338
00:18:54.651 --> 00:18:55.670
You're a terrific host.

339
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:57.710
<v 2>Thanks, Alan. I appreciate it.</v>
