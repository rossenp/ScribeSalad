<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.390
<v 1>Are the state Corona virus shutdowns taking away our personal freedoms.</v>

3
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.040
Joining me to discuss that a more political commentator and author of don't burn

4
00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:22.611
this book,

5
00:00:22.611 --> 00:00:25.970
which Dave Rubin just told me has made the New York times bestsellers list.

6
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.510
Wait and go, Dave. All right. Listen to me. So yeah,

7
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.620
all of us as Americans are independent,

8
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.630
we're freedom loving and the locking us up. Okay. Whether it's a show,

9
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.620
Shelley Luther or the rest of us, what are we going to do to get out of this?

10
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.410
<v 2>Yeah. Well, first off,</v>

11
00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:50.090
let me just say that Shelly Luther is a true American hero and every American

12
00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:53.480
should believe that regardless of their political persuasion, I mean,

13
00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:57.440
the woman wants to put food on her kid's table. It's a beautiful thing.

14
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.020
I'm here in California. I live in Los Angeles,

15
00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:02.540
so I have a progressive governor and Gavin Newsome.

16
00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:04.580
I've got a progressive mayor and Eric [inaudible],

17
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.060
who's literally telling me to go out and snitch on my neighbors and maybe I'm

18
00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:11.150
going to get a reward. Gavin Newsome, of course, who's the governor.

19
00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:13.700
He was the one that was the mayor of San Francisco.

20
00:01:13.701 --> 00:01:16.250
And he basically ruined that city. And you know, they're,

21
00:01:16.251 --> 00:01:19.280
they're telling us that we can't go to the beach. Well, here in,

22
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.920
so Cal it's about 85 and perfect today.

23
00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:25.550
And I did get a little color in my backyard, but it's like, how about you?

24
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.870
Tell us something mature.

25
00:01:26.871 --> 00:01:31.190
Tell us we have to go to the beach at half capacity and maybe have a car with a

26
00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:33.860
space between another car. And you can only go in group support,

27
00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:38.180
give us something that will make us feel like mature adults as you're supposed

28
00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:39.620
to do as government officials.

29
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:42.950
Don't just say you can't go to the beach just because we say it as if,

30
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.050
as if what they say is true, just because they worded it.

31
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.540
And I think that's the problem with progressive. Generally.

32
00:01:50.541 --> 00:01:53.360
They think that because they say something it's inherently true.

33
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.290
<v 1>Well, you know, what's amazing about New York.</v>

34
00:01:57.291 --> 00:02:01.010
We just found out this week that some incredible number of people who were

35
00:02:01.011 --> 00:02:04.790
staying at home, sheltering it at home. It's like 66%.

36
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:08.210
It may be even higher than that are coming up with a Corona virus.

37
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.080
So stay at home, you get the virus, at least let them get a tan, you know,

38
00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:14.270
a little vitamin D would help them out. Don't you think.

39
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.360
<v 2>A little vitamin D would help them out and I'll tell you this. Look, my family,</v>

40
00:02:20.361 --> 00:02:23.450
I, I come from New York. I was born in Brooklyn. I grew up in long Island.

41
00:02:23.451 --> 00:02:26.240
I lived in Manhattan. Most of my life. Most of my family lives in New York,

42
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.410
my sister and her family. You know, the weather is good.

43
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:32.120
I thought we had a beach. Now we don't have it.

44
00:02:32.121 --> 00:02:34.790
I'm not sure what I'm doing here, Texas is looking pretty good these days,

45
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:37.160
but I will tell you this, my, my sister and her family,

46
00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:41.180
and two kids just moved out of New York city this week because people people

47
00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:45.770
want to be free. Your intro is exactly right. Americans love Liberty,

48
00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:49.790
love freedom. And by the way, we're willing to take a little risk to be free.

49
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.481
Nobody's saying,

50
00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:53.870
just get out there and do whatever you want and crowd everything people are

51
00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:57.980
saying, Hey, we got to get back to our lives. We're not hamsters in a cage.

52
00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.050
And you got,

53
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.880
let us take a little risk so we can decide what the threshold is for

54
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.960
our lives, as opposed to just be getting it as an edict, uh, you know,

55
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:11.830
from somebody up in Sacramento in my case. Yeah.

56
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.270
<v 1>Well, and the shame of it all is, you know, we've all been,</v>

57
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.530
we've all been trained to wash our hands and keep our hands away from our face

58
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.860
that, um, you know, you would think they would figure, well,

59
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.800
they've got some of it, right. You know, maybe we can let them out a little bit.

60
00:03:25.801 --> 00:03:26.910
But anyway, Dave Rubin,

61
00:03:26.911 --> 00:03:30.810
I want to congratulate you on knitting the New York times bestsellers list.

62
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.600
