WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.010
<v 0>But my God day after day to see these howling, uh,</v>

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.620
oppress people, you know,

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.570
like all I have decided that the narrative is that Trump is some

4
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:14.160
sort of Basquiat figure, you know,

5
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:18.960
who's just not doing anything and that people are dying because of him,

6
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.680
you know? Uh, it's a, it's a real shock. And I, I,

7
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.550
I don't want to say I'm grateful for him because I think he's meant as errors,

8
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:30.990
but for day to day, I'm sure you feel the same way.

9
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.920
My God, if, if the Trump administration went along with what CNN,

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.150
MSNBC and the, I'm sorry to say unspeakable,

11
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:41.150
New York times, uh, New York times a,

12
00:00:41.151 --> 00:00:45.000
a venue that I've always adored and always

13
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.040
loved, uh, and to see what they did,

14
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.630
what they helped enable.

15
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.450
Um, I just don't know if there's any such thing as moral culpability. Um,

16
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.540
I think I'm so sorry to say it again. It breaks my heart.

17
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.900
I think the New York times is morally culpable for what's happened to this

18
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:07.860
country, uh, today.

19
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.660
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

20
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.490
<v 2>Rubin and this is the Rubin report reminder.</v>

21
00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:24.230
Everybody locked down is more fun with friends and add free video and podcasts.

22
00:01:24.231 --> 00:01:25.400
So please consider joining

23
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.830
us@rubinreport.com and joining me today is the editorial director at the

24
00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:34.430
American Institute for economic research, Jeffrey Tucker,

25
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.630
welcome back to the Rubin report.

26
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.560
<v 0>It's going to be here. Uh, Dave, nice to see you again.</v>

27
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.090
<v 2>Good to see you again. I'm sorry. We're not doing this in person,</v>

28
00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:47.690
but we are social distancing like everybody else. Uh,

29
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:51.440
so I guess my first question to you is, uh, well,

30
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.850
just how you doing, how you doing in a time of social distancing and life?

31
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.270
<v 0>Well, I got to give the same answer anybody would, which is, uh,</v>

32
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.000
I can't believe that this is the world we live in.

33
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.780
I never would've imagined this been three weeks ago,

34
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.580
but so wow. We're, we're fairing. We're not starving. We're not dying.

35
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.050
We're talking to people and you know, I wrote a book called the market,

36
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:20.690
loves you. And, uh, all I can say is the market,

37
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.290
all the bludgeoned and truncated and, and, uh,

38
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.040
it's never been attacked like this before, maybe in the history of the world,

39
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.200
it's still somehow working. So I'm very, very grateful for that.

40
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.030
Yeah.

41
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.940
<v 2>It seems like the right start to this because, uh,</v>

42
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.660
throughout the last month or so you're one of the few people I would say that is

43
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.160
making some consistent sense to me, at least on Twitter. And,

44
00:02:45.161 --> 00:02:48.230
and I think you're, you're a pretty great classical liberal thinker,

45
00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:49.310
which is why I want it to have here.

46
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.130
Cause I want to talk about stimulus and I want to talk about markets and I want

47
00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:55.970
to talk about the constitution and free speech and right to assembly and all of

48
00:02:55.971 --> 00:03:00.790
those things that, that I know you and I, and my audience all love. Um,

49
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.520
so why don't, why don't we start with this, uh,

50
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.440
which is just going off what you just said there,

51
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.420
we seem to be more resilient perhaps than, than we thought. I mean,

52
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:13.150
I think if you had said to people six months ago, Hey,

53
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.690
do you know that in March and April, you're going to be shut down,

54
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.810
locked in your house,

55
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.980
along with virtually the rest of the world for now going on five weeks.

56
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:24.580
And it could be months after that. I think people would have thought, Oh,

57
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.950
there's going to be violence. Oh, there's going to be looting.

58
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.840
There's going to be crime, all of these things. And yet as you started us with,

59
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.220
we're doing okay and the markets actually haven't completely tanked.

60
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:39.430
We were going up and down, but everything is kind of working.

61
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.350
<v 0>Oh, Dave, I could tell you such inspiring stories.</v>

62
00:03:43.351 --> 00:03:45.090
I just want to cry when I think about it, you know,

63
00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:48.960
when I go to the grocery store, which is one of the things you can do now,

64
00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.460
it's an access to real life. And I go in there and I, first of all,

65
00:03:53.461 --> 00:03:56.940
make sure to thank every single worker there for all of their,

66
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:57.803
that they're doing.

67
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.980
But I like to talk to the managers about how they decide what they're going to

68
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.820
do that day, you know, uh, was there a run on chicken yesterday?

69
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.670
What'd you do about that? You know, it, wasn't a run on sausage,

70
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.140
what'd you do about the salads, you know, over here in the deli section,

71
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.000
um, how you getting toilet paper,

72
00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:19.470
how you rashing it given that there's restrictions on private price

73
00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:23.790
movements, um, um, how has this changed your lives? You know, uh,

74
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.850
and all I hear is stories of heroism and brilliance and,

75
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.080
and it's not just individual brilliance, it's institutional brilliance,

76
00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:35.670
and it's the brilliance of the market economy.

77
00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:38.100
It's still working despite everything,

78
00:04:38.101 --> 00:04:41.670
despite being clobbered in ways that were

79
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.800
unimaginable, um, just a few months ago. And if I can say, so,

80
00:04:46.801 --> 00:04:48.420
Dave, um,

81
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.800
this brings to mind a real paradox of the times we're living through right now,

82
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.440
this shutdown has presumed the adaptability of

83
00:04:58.441 --> 00:05:03.270
society. You know, the capacity of society to make this radical turn,

84
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.720
to go from one life to the other life,

85
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.840
practically overnight, to,

86
00:05:09.841 --> 00:05:13.980
to adopt a seemingly impossible pose.

87
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.120
And,

88
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.920
and yet the government edicts that have come down have presumed the

89
00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:24.660
impossibility of society to adapt to the presence of pandemic disease. You know,

90
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:25.980
like we can adapt to it.

91
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.600
<v 2>Is that, is that adaptability.</v>

92
00:05:27.601 --> 00:05:32.580
D do you think that adaptability is unique to capitalism because of the way it

93
00:05:32.581 --> 00:05:37.560
allows so many people to be in the market and innovate and move

94
00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:39.540
as things need to be moved?

95
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.760
<v 0>Yeah, it's, it's, it's,</v>

96
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.690
it's an embedded in the essence of a free society where we're,

97
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.640
where people learn to be intelligent and learned to control their world with

98
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:51.683
people,

99
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.280
create these market signals that tell us about prices and interest in

100
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.460
all things. Um, I think, you know,

101
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:03.230
at the end of this, if you're not a libertarian,

102
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:07.730
you're not paying attention because the market is worth and,

103
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.240
uh, brilliantly, and it's only not worked when it's been,

104
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.180
when it's been hobbled and it has been hobbled, you know,

105
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.360
it was hobbled before this crisis actually.

106
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:22.070
And we can talk about all the specific ways in which true I blame. Um,

107
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.150
I don't, I get, I don't blame coronavirus for your suffering right now.

108
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.210
The virus has always been with us and always will be. And,

109
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.620
and society had developed ways to deal with viruses, medical professionals,

110
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:38.210
especially, um, have learned how to deal with, uh, viruses.

111
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:40.850
And it's a challenge for any society under any conditions,

112
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:45.410
but what you want above all else is freedom and adaptability.

113
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.490
And, uh,

114
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.720
to decentralize decision-making in the U S Dave,

115
00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:55.010
for some reason, we took a completely different direction. Fortunately,

116
00:06:55.011 --> 00:06:56.480
we haven't shut down the stock market.

117
00:06:56.481 --> 00:07:01.310
We haven't shut down essential stores and it's thanks to that,

118
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.680
that we're eating today. You know,

119
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:06.620
that we're sleeping today that we're able to get by. So

120
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.760
we owe the fact that we're surviving through this. It's,

121
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.450
it's a hundred percent the element of freedom that remains in the system.

122
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:16.421
<v 2>But Jeffrey,</v>

123
00:07:16.421 --> 00:07:20.980
I keep reading all these brilliant think pieces saying how this is the shows,

124
00:07:20.981 --> 00:07:25.420
the failure of libertarianism and limited government, because this,

125
00:07:25.421 --> 00:07:29.410
if ever, this is the moment we need big government to do things.

126
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.820
And the very people who have been calling Trump Hitler for four years are now

127
00:07:33.821 --> 00:07:37.000
demanding that he do more with his power. Is,

128
00:07:37.001 --> 00:07:40.390
am I not understanding things properly? What am I missing here?

129
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.770
<v 0>I think you and I share the same frustration.</v>

130
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.850
The response of the left has been alarming to me,

131
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.330
to an extent that I find indescribable,

132
00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:55.540
because I think last time I was on your show,

133
00:07:55.570 --> 00:08:00.370
I myself was warning about the danger of the authoritarianism of Trump.

134
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.600
And, and we can get into that. I think he's made some bad decisions here, uh,

135
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.040
and they STEM from his let's explore all of it for sure. Yeah. And he,

136
00:08:09.041 --> 00:08:13.240
they extend from his own nationalism and his own, uh, illiberalism really,

137
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.930
um, which I think is going to be seriously problematic.

138
00:08:16.931 --> 00:08:21.460
But my God day after day to see these howling,

139
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.490
uh, press people, you know,

140
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:29.440
like all I have decided that the narrative is that Trump is the some

141
00:08:29.441 --> 00:08:31.030
sort of Basquiat figure, you know,

142
00:08:31.031 --> 00:08:35.830
who's just not doing anything and that people are dying because of him,

143
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:39.550
you know? Uh, it's a, it's a real shock. And I, I,

144
00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.420
I don't want to say I'm grateful for him because I think was meant as errors,

145
00:08:43.421 --> 00:08:47.860
but for day to day, I'm sure you feel the same way.

146
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.150
My God, if,

147
00:08:49.151 --> 00:08:54.020
if the Trump administration went along with what CNN MSNBC and

148
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:58.010
the, I'm sorry, say unspeakable New York times, uh, New York times a,

149
00:08:58.011 --> 00:09:01.860
a venue that I've always adored and always

150
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.900
loved, uh, and to see what they did,

151
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.520
what they helped enable.

152
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:17.310
Um, I just don't know if there's any such thing as moral culpability. Um,

153
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.400
I think I'm so sorry to say it again. It breaks my heart.

154
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.760
I think the New York times is morally culpable for what's happened to this

155
00:09:23.761 --> 00:09:26.060
country, uh, today. And I, you know, I,

156
00:09:26.061 --> 00:09:30.960
I listened to the daily podcast and I saw the hysteria being ramped up and the,

157
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.430
and the demands for crackdowns and they the call for a medieval response to this

158
00:09:35.431 --> 00:09:38.640
and that the demands for, I don't know what you would call it,

159
00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:42.360
but a fascist communist, you know, social distancing policies.

160
00:09:42.361 --> 00:09:46.620
And it's been grim and shocking. And I you've been shocked.

161
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.380
I've been shocked. I don't know what to say. I mean.

162
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:54.080
<v 2>So it's so interesting that you're as concerned about the media element as</v>

163
00:09:54.081 --> 00:09:57.560
Diane, because it seems to me that we're fighting two viruses right now,

164
00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.170
we all know about the Corona virus and how to fight that. But the,

165
00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:05.570
the misinformation virus that is now permeating throughout the media,

166
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:06.380
um,

167
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:10.910
and it's New York times and it's Vox and it's CNN and the list goes on and on is

168
00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:14.060
making it almost impossible for any of us to have.

169
00:10:14.061 --> 00:10:16.070
What I would say is the same conversation,

170
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.520
because we're all dealing with different sets of information.

171
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.100
How concerned generally are you about that?

172
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.990
<v 0>Oh, tremendously. I, I actually, I summarize this, you know,</v>

173
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.430
we've all been talking to friends on, on, uh, what happened, right?

174
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.120
So throughout the day that this, I really blame, uh,

175
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.930
some hucksters, uh, scientists, fake scientists

176
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.590
computed by holding media, uh, anti-Trump media, you know, combined with,

177
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.000
uh, a panicked political class. And it was a kind of a perfect storm.

178
00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.570
Those three elements came together and, uh,

179
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.940
led to a level of wreckage. That's,

180
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.350
that's unspeakable and an unconscionable morally.

181
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.520
I have to tell you, because, you know, for years,

182
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.630
people have told me about the evil of the mainstream media,

183
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.870
and I've never really wanted to go there. You know,

184
00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:13.970
like I'm a big believer in press freedom,

185
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:18.110
and I never wanted to be one of those people to trash the New York times,

186
00:11:18.111 --> 00:11:21.830
you know, and I've actually, I love the New York times I always have. Um,

187
00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:26.150
but I feel like I've gotten a real wake-up call here a real shock.

188
00:11:26.151 --> 00:11:30.220
I don't know how you can be in the mainstream press today and,

189
00:11:30.221 --> 00:11:35.000
and be salivating over the clicks and the views and, and, and,

190
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:35.780
you know, the,

191
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:39.650
the amount of ad bias that they're generating from this while watching freedom,

192
00:11:39.651 --> 00:11:43.300
just go down the drain. Um, it's, it's, it's,

193
00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.400
it's been a shock me. I, I just can't,

194
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:50.850
I can't even describe to you how horrifying that's been to me. And I,

195
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.010
I have to tell you the truth. I've really turned off. I've had to.

196
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.170
<v 3>If you're looking for more.</v>
