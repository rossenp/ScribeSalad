1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.960
<v 0>Globally. We are much better off than we used to be, of course,</v>

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.430
in a well of well advanced countries, rich countries, people are much richer,

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.020
but the world as a whole is getting richer, which is why poverty has declined.

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.090
Absolute poverty has declined for about 90% of humanity in 1800 to less

5
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:22.770
than 8% today. I just want to repeat that in 1800, just 200 years ago,

6
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.750
90% of people lived on $2 per person per day.

7
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.550
Today, roughly 8% of people live on $2 per person per day.

8
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.850
So, um, yes, the,

9
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:40.770
the great increase in the richest has resulted in a substantial

10
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:43.620
reduction in, uh, in absolute poverty.

11
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.570
We have seen a billion people rise from absolute poverty in China in the last 40

12
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:51.420
or 50 years, we are seeing India coming up.

13
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.100
We are seeing a number of African countries growing at 5% per year. Um,

14
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.860
there there's a lot of good news that's happening in the world.

15
00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.833
<v 1>Right.</v>

16
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.480
<v 2>To the, the top 10 that you talk about here,</v>

17
00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:12.290
but the book has 78 trends that are going well.

18
00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:14.330
So we're going to plow through this top 10, and then I'm just going to,

19
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.300
I'm going to quiz you on a couple of random ones as well,

20
00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:18.470
but I'm going to go through them right here.

21
00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:22.010
So the first trend that you guys have is the great enrichment.

22
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.090
And this is basically about the economy. So can you lay this out?

23
00:01:26.091 --> 00:01:29.810
Because a lot of people think we're, we're poor. The divide is worse than ever,

24
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:33.080
and we seem to be getting poor, but it's actually not true.

25
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.240
<v 0>Since the historical record begun. Um,</v>

26
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.990
people lived on about $2 per person per day,

27
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.240
2000 years ago at the time of Christ or Caesar Augustus people in America,

28
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.030
in Europe, in Africa, anywhere in the world,

29
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.930
lived on $2 a day or so that is why today.

30
00:01:53.931 --> 00:01:58.460
When we talk about absolute poverty about living at a subsistence level,

31
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.410
we talk about that $2 level because that's how people used to live

32
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.830
since the Dawn of time. Really. Um,

33
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.560
now bringing it back to all,

34
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.190
bringing it forward all the way to 18 hundreds at the time of Thomas Jefferson

35
00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:14.024
presidency,

36
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.160
global income per capita per day is only $2 and 80.

37
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.360
So it's still very, very low. But today 200 years later,

38
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.570
it is $44 per person per day,

39
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.280
globally in the United States is roughly $160 per person per

40
00:02:31.281 --> 00:02:35.630
day. And if, um, if the current trends continue,

41
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.610
if we are able to repeat the growth that we had over the last hundred years and

42
00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:42.890
projected to 2100,

43
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.290
then Everage global income will be $144 per person per

44
00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:52.460
day. So from $2, since the Dawn of time,

45
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.920
two $44 today to about 150 in 2100,

46
00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.233
that's the,

47
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.340
of the tremendous economic growth that we have experienced in the last 200

48
00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:05.710
years, and that we can still experience in the future.

49
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.070
<v 2>So I think one of the things that confuses people,</v>

50
00:03:08.071 --> 00:03:11.460
at least when we hear this through the mainstream media is they're the I there's

51
00:03:11.461 --> 00:03:15.300
this idea that the rich keep getting richer and that the poor are getting

52
00:03:15.301 --> 00:03:16.200
poorer. But,

53
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.560
but the argument that you're laying out in essence is not that the rich aren't

54
00:03:19.561 --> 00:03:21.450
getting richer, many rich people are getting richer,

55
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.160
but that the entire pool is actually being raised at the same time.

56
00:03:26.161 --> 00:03:30.930
So the lowest person is in far better shape now than they were

57
00:03:30.931 --> 00:03:32.340
say 200 years ago.

58
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.410
<v 0>That's correct. Uh,</v>

59
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.880
the data which are just presented our data based on global average,

60
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.680
which is to say a person living maybe somewhere in Indonesia or Malaysia,

61
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.130
right in the middle of the pack, they there, the data is not distorted,

62
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.070
uh, by, uh, by, you know,

63
00:03:50.071 --> 00:03:53.490
looking at just very rich people and high income inequality,

64
00:03:53.491 --> 00:03:58.290
or what have you globally. We are much better off than we used to be, of course,

65
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.760
in a well of well advanced countries, rich countries, people are much richer,

66
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.350
but the world as a whole is getting richer, which is why poverty has declined.

67
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.420
Absolute poverty has declined for about 90% of humanity in 1800 to less

68
00:04:12.421 --> 00:04:17.100
than 8% today. I just want to repeat that in 1800, just 200 years ago,

69
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.050
90% of people lived on $2 per person per day

70
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.880
today, roughly 8% of people live on $2 per person per day.

71
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.760
So, um, yes, the, the great increase in,

72
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.630
in richest has resulted in a substantial reduction in, uh,

73
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.950
in absolute poverty.

74
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.930
We have seen a billion people rise from absolute poverty in China in the last 40

75
00:04:42.931 --> 00:04:45.750
or 50 years, we are seeing India coming up.

76
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.430
We are seeing a number of African countries growing at 5% per year. Um,

77
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.400
there there's a lot of good news that's happening in the world,

78
00:04:53.401 --> 00:04:54.990
or at least there was before COVID.

79
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.020
<v 2>And since, uh, this election is a week away,</v>

80
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.070
we should talk about the forces that make all of that happen.

81
00:05:02.071 --> 00:05:04.980
It has a little something to do with free markets, right?

82
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.133
<v 0>That's correct.</v>

83
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.180
The greatest decline in absolute poverty in the world is a

84
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.290
core Terminus.

85
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.580
Whereas the opening of the global economy after 1980,

86
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.930
this is called the period of globalization. Now I realized that a lot of people,

87
00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:25.890
including a lot of people in United States are ambivalent about globalization,

88
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.630
but there is no doubt that once these formerly poor countries

89
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.860
dropped socialism and central planning embraced free markets,

90
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.180
embraced multinational corporations and inward foreign investment.

91
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.680
Once that happened, these countries started to grow at a much faster pace,

92
00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:48.510
which is why today places like China are middle income countries. Uh,

93
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.660
they are no longer dirt poor. I mean, at the time of mal,

94
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.030
these people literally ate dirt today. They're sending people to the moon, well,

95
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.490
least the space. So my work is that working out the last,

96
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.970
the last 40 years have been exceptionally good,

97
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.250
especially for poor countries.

98
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.270
<v 2>Yeah. All right. Let's go to number two here,</v>

99
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.020
which is really an offshoot of this, that in many ways,

100
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.480
we're at the end of poverty.

101
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.510
<v 0>Absolute poverty. Yes. As you well know in the United States, uh,</v>

102
00:06:21.511 --> 00:06:25.480
we no longer have absolute poverty. Nobody lives on $2 per day.

103
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.850
Even people who don't have a job, uh,

104
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.470
can access food and all sorts of facilities, which are provided by the taxpayer,

105
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.810
but globally, um, absolute poverty had been,

106
00:06:37.811 --> 00:06:41.200
or was before COVID at its lowest. It has ever been,

107
00:06:41.201 --> 00:06:44.440
which is to say less than 8%. And now of course,

108
00:06:44.441 --> 00:06:49.300
as countries become richer, they start to redefine poverty in a different way,

109
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.280
which is why in the United States.

110
00:06:51.281 --> 00:06:54.040
We don't talk about absolute poverty when we talk about poverty.

111
00:06:54.041 --> 00:06:55.300
So relative problem poverty,

112
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.620
it's a certain percentage of the mean national income that we consider.

113
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.720
If people live under that they are in poverty, but,

114
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.910
but we don't have absolute poverty in the United States.

115
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.320
<v 2>You know, from someone sitting where I am in Los Angeles,</v>

116
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:13.270
where I'm seeing many more homeless people than there were a couple of

117
00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:13.751
years ago,

118
00:07:13.751 --> 00:07:16.600
we know that this is happening in a lot of the big cities in Portland,

119
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:21.040
in Seattle, certainly in San Francisco. I think people see that, you know,

120
00:07:21.041 --> 00:07:25.100
you see tent cities, you see more homeless people, et cetera, et cetera. And,

121
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:28.720
and the inclination is, Oh, well, I'm seeing something. So it must be,

122
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.070
it must be significantly worse than it was. Um,

123
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.630
but is it, is it just that that's happening in just some cities or,

124
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.110
or is it just that your anecdotal evidence doesn't really prove anything?

125
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.780
<v 0>Well, uh, whether you look at, uh, poverty as a, as a relative measure,</v>

126
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.180
relative poverty as a percentage of national income,

127
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.430
or what do you look at consumption poverty. In other words,

128
00:07:51.431 --> 00:07:55.480
how much do people actually spend on, uh, on monthly basis, a weekly basis,

129
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.400
poverty is an all-time low.

130
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:02.290
I suspect that what's happening in places like San Francisco and Los Angeles is

131
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.830
that new policies have been implemented by local governments,

132
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:09.940
which make it more attractive for, uh, for,

133
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:11.860
for people who, um,

134
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.700
may not be necessarily interested in, in,

135
00:08:15.701 --> 00:08:20.200
in jobs may not necessarily be interested in normal, uh, lifestyles,

136
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.930
people who may, for whatever reason prefer the, um, the, the,

137
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:29.740
the, the freedom, essentially of not being tied to any, any, uh,

138
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.880
anything concrete and want to live in these 10 cities and who may have been

139
00:08:33.881 --> 00:08:37.930
living in those 10 cities throughout the United States. But for whatever reason,

140
00:08:37.931 --> 00:08:40.870
because the policies of local governments are now changed.

141
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:45.280
These people are being pulled like a magnet towards certain jurisdictions.

142
00:08:45.281 --> 00:08:48.250
And that's why you see many more of them. That would be, I think,

143
00:08:48.251 --> 00:08:50.950
one reason why, why you see that anecdotally?

144
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.140
<v 2>Yeah. And we do know by the way that they're,</v>

145
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.120
they're putting in policies in places like San Francisco and Los Angeles that

146
00:08:57.121 --> 00:08:59.010
are attracting more homeless people.

147
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.010
It's not something that you're just making up at one point, there was a policy.

148
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:03.750
I'm not sure if we still have it in Los Angeles,

149
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.520
where if you build a structure on public land, they can't remove it.

150
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.860
You got an awful lot of people paying,

151
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:12.840
paying mortgages on land that they bought.

152
00:09:12.841 --> 00:09:14.070
I don't know what we're doing over here.

153
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:19.430
<v 0>I would simply add just to clarify one comment I made in my last, uh, um,</v>

154
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.350
contribution. And that is that, uh,

155
00:09:21.351 --> 00:09:26.300
when I say that people don't necessarily want to have a home and work

156
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.540
for a living, et cetera, it, I'm not making a value judgment.

157
00:09:29.541 --> 00:09:30.860
I'm saying that there is a,

158
00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:33.890
there are a lot of people who have very different conceptions about what a good

159
00:09:33.891 --> 00:09:36.350
life is. And also in addition to that,

160
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:41.360
there are a lot of people who may be mentally unstable, uh,

161
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:45.890
who have all sorts of mental ill problems that prevents them from keeping a job

162
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.950
and remaining in one place, um, at, at, at the same time.

163

164
00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:55.940

170
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.820
for people who live in the cities and who actually pay taxes.
