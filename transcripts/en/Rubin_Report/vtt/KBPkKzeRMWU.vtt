00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.980
<v 0>Most people assume,</v>

2
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:14.160
or at the very least hope that their governments are doing the right thing,

3
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:17.820
but can you take this now down to the personal level and the community level,

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.211
you know,

5
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:22.020
from as simple as washing hands to just other techniques people should be doing

6
00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:23.160
in their daily lives right now.

7
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.470
<v 1>So the first messages wash your hands a lot and touch your face less.</v>

8
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.920
That's the thing that everybody can do now because we're in a pandemic state,

9
00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:33.800
we have to think about social distancing and that's going to be a little bit

10
00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:36.260
different for every person, depending on what's essential to them.

11
00:00:36.261 --> 00:00:37.220
And what's not essential.

12
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.220
Starting with people who are older or who have medical problems,

13
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.310
they need to start thinking about their interactions with other people and

14
00:00:43.311 --> 00:00:45.640
trying to limit their risk, because that's what we're really worried about here.

15
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.870
That's what this is all designed to help them.

16
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.780
Because if they end up getting sick in large numbers,

17
00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:54.230
we will crash our whole U S healthcare system because we don't have the capacity

18
00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:57.140
to deal with that many sick people, such as what's going on in Italy.

19
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.370
Other individuals who are lower risk, you have to think about what you're doing,

20
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.900
how you can minimize your time,

21
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.900
minimize your contacts without completely destroying your quality of life.

22
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.130
You might there there's, you know,

23
00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:10.100
there's some variation on what people can and can't do right now.

24
00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:12.260
We're seeing governors, close bars and restaurants.

25
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.140
And I think that's something that you're going to see more of because there's

26
00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.450
too much social interaction going on in those types of places.

27
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:19.970
And they end up being a nexus for the spread of the virus.

28
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.330
But I do think that just being common, common sense, you know,

29
00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:26.210
if you're going to the gym, go at times where there's not, not peak hours,

30
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.720
maybe order out instead of take order takeout instead of sitting in a

31
00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:30.170
restaurant,

32
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.470
maybe in mass gatherings and basically being banned everywhere because of their,

33
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.590
their risks. That's not an issue to think about, uh, any more, but it's,

34
00:01:36.591 --> 00:01:39.980
it's that type of thing that you're going to have to do at least for a period of

35
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.760
two weeks,

36
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.570
maybe longer to see if we can actually blunt the response blunt the curve

37
00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:48.020
basically, or flatten it out because we don't want to exceed hospital capacity.

38
00:01:48.021 --> 00:01:48.800
So the,

39
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.130
the idea is let's slow the number of the rate of infection so that they're

40
00:01:52.131 --> 00:01:54.980
coming at a slower clip to the hospital so that they don't get overwhelmed

41
00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:56.960
because we're really nervous about that. That's the biggest,

42
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.480
that's the biggest in the linchpin in our response.

43
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.431
<v 0>So I,</v>

44
00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:04.430
I know that you talked about the differences that Italy has just in terms of the

45
00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:07.940
demographics and population. Um, but I hear a lot of people saying, Oh,

46
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:12.290
we're just two weeks behind Italy. Do you think that that's a fair estimation?

47
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.170
<v 1>If you look at the numbers, we,</v>

48
00:02:15.171 --> 00:02:17.720
we have a case count around what Italy had two weeks before.

49
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.230
So I think it is something that people are saying with some evidence behind it.

50
00:02:21.231 --> 00:02:24.980
I think we're going to start to know if we're going to follow this Italian type

51
00:02:24.981 --> 00:02:28.190
of model or we're going to have more of a South Korean outbreak, but, uh,

52
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.830
it's increasingly looking like it might be a little bit of a hybrid between them

53
00:02:30.831 --> 00:02:32.690
because we were not as quick with, uh,

54
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.420
testing mild cases and isolating them as South Korea was.

55
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.730
<v 0>Yeah. Can you talk about flattening the curve?</v>

56
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.950
That seems to be the phrase that everybody's talking about.

57
00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:41.600
We're seeing a lot of images on Twitter.

58
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.230
<v 1>Sure, sure. So what we're talking about here is the epidemic curve.</v>

59
00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:48.050
So think of it like a bell curve, you have a peak in cases, and then they go,

60
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.760
they peak and they come down. What we're trying.

61
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.100
And then me have a line here where hospital capacity is.

62
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.530
You want to keep your curve below hospital capacity,

63
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.290
even if it means you have the same amount of cases, but you flatten it out.

64
00:02:57.291 --> 00:03:00.640
So you never exceed hospital. So that's what we're trying to do.

65
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:02.290
We know that we can't contain this virus,

66
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:06.850
but can we slow the accumulation of cases to a rate that's manageable by

67
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:09.670
hospitals? That's what flattening the curve is. So you don't have this big peak.

68
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:13.600
You kind of have a rolling peak. That's not as, not as huge of a spike.

69
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:14.200
And that's the,

70
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.140
that's kind of the strategy being pursued by many different countries. Now,

71
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:18.580
in order to preserve our hospitals.

72
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.160
<v 0>There are guys like you turning for sensible information.</v>

73
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.420
I see online.

74
00:03:24.421 --> 00:03:27.720
That seems to be the number one thing just for the average person is we live in

75
00:03:27.721 --> 00:03:31.260
a strange time where people don't trust our institutions the way they used to.

76
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.140
You know, there's always a lot of noise on social media. I mean,

77
00:03:34.141 --> 00:03:36.550
w where are you getting actual information? Where,

78
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:39.960
where should we point people to besides, you know, interviews like this and,

79
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.063
and things like that?

80
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.280
<v 1>Well, so obviously there, you know, if you're an infectious disease person,</v>

81
00:03:44.281 --> 00:03:46.440
you kind of have your own sources that might not be suitable for,

82
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.840
for people in the general public, but there are good sources.

83
00:03:48.841 --> 00:03:50.910
The CDC is actually a very good site.

84
00:03:50.911 --> 00:03:52.860
There's a lot of stuff on there that you can use.

85
00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:57.540
That's actually vetted and there's guidance and lots of different types of all

86
00:03:57.541 --> 00:03:59.100
types of different scenarios. You could imagine.

87
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.190
I think I would also make sure that people are looking at their local and state

88
00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:04.290
health department websites, because if something happens to them,

89
00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:05.160
it's going to be local.

90
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.610
You need to know what's going on locally and what the plant plans are there as

91
00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:12.210
well. And then I would say for science stuff, I recommend stat news.

92
00:04:12.211 --> 00:04:14.280
The most that news is owned by the Boston globe.

93
00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:17.610
It's probably the best scientific reporting, uh, in the, in the world. Uh,

94
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.350
that's where I, I look at that every day.

95
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.080
And there's another group called Sid rap CID rap,

96
00:04:22.081 --> 00:04:24.240
which is at the university of Minnesota. Uh,

97
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.610
that's the center for infectious disease research and policy.

98
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.540
They also put out very good, uh, news articles that are easily digestible, uh,

99
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.450
by the public and have a lot of really great factual information there.

100
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.720
<v 0>Everyone we're obviously in some unchartered territory with coronavirus and our</v>

101
00:04:36.721 --> 00:04:40.320
plan here is to help you make as much sense of the situation in a not alarmist

102
00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:41.310
fashion as possible.

103
00:04:41.311 --> 00:04:45.060
