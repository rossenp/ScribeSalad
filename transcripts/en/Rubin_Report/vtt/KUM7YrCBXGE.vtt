1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>It became apparent rather quickly that,</v>

2
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.040
that it was a bigger deal than maybe I thought. Um,

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.340
cause I was mostly just annoyed that, that I had to,

4
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.810
I had to deal with it at all.

5
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.700
<v 2>Go back to the beginning. The thing that sort of made you a national figure,</v>

6
00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:24.830
although you were a Congressman already, uh,

7
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.540
let's talk about Saturday night live.

8
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:29.750
I'm sure you've never talked about that before. Right. Maybe, maybe once,

9
00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:34.490
maybe twice. Can you just talk a little bit about that night? You see,

10
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.380
you see the Pete Davidson sketch and then just sort of all the fallout and then

11
00:00:39.381 --> 00:00:42.860
what you did ultimately, was it literally, I think the next week when you,

12
00:00:42.861 --> 00:00:44.480
when you went on the show, um,

13
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.050
and just talk about how that then sort of set you up to be a more national

14
00:00:48.051 --> 00:00:51.590
figure instead of just a, you know, a Congressman from, from Texas.

15
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.120
<v 0>Yeah. Um, well obviously I wasn't, I wasn't really watching it that night.</v>

16
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.630
Of course, you know, nobody is right. I think most people, uh,

17
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.440
digest the most people digest Saturday night live from like the next day's

18
00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:07.340
YouTube videos or something. Um, if it's a good skit and that's,

19
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.720
that was no different on this one,

20
00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:12.620
of course that story started getting written about it. Um, I had not seen it.

21
00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:16.460
I had some funny text messages from my buddies that were just giving me a hard

22
00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:20.150
time for it. You know, we have a very dark sense of humor in the teams and, um,

23
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.750
it became apparent rather quickly that,

24
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.330
that it was a bigger deal than maybe I thought. Um,

25
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.100
cause I was mostly just annoyed that I had to, I had to deal with it at all.

26
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.310
Um, it was, uh, it was, there was a lot going on that day.

27
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.550
That was the Sunday before the election. Um, you know,

28
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.260
we were doing pretty well, but uh,

29
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.140
but I had a lot of events I had to get to and um,

30
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.940
it felt more like an annoyance. I was not,

31
00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:47.720
I was not used to having to respond publicly to things probably the way I'm more

32
00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:48.554
used to that. Now.

33
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.340
<v 2>The one sentence recap of, of what the skit was or what the line was.</v>

34
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.420
<v 0>Sure, sure. So yeah,</v>

35
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.860
Pete Davidson was basically going down a list of a quote unquote gross people,

36
00:02:00.861 --> 00:02:05.630
all politicians, um, all, all except for one were Republican.

37
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.620
And um, he basically just makes fun of everybody. But with me, he, you know,

38
00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:11.060
at first he's like this guy,

39
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.270
he looks kind of like a Hitman and a porno and that was pretty funny to be

40
00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:18.590
honest. Um, but, but uh, then he goes off, sorry, like, you know,

41
00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:21.200
he lost his eye and war or whatever. Right.

42
00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:23.840
And it was that it was that single line that,

43
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.730
that seems so dismissive of a war injury that just injured people nuts. And,

44
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.730
um, and understandably so. And um,

45
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.220
now the way I analyzed this and the way I analyze it in my book, um,

46
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.293
is,

47
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.340
is it was pretty obvious that he was trying to take a dig at

48
00:02:43.341 --> 00:02:47.450
conservatives, right? It is it's the Davidson it's Saturday night live it,

49
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.710
they dig it Democrats plenty too. But, um, but on this particular skit,

50
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.250
it was a very clear swipe at conservatives, um, because the

51
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.090
it's obvious just, just watch it. Um,

52
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.310
but it wasn't as it was not as obvious that that he was trying to

53
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.510
insult, um, wounded veterans, you know? And so there was a,

54
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.880
there was the thought process the next day was okay,

55
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:12.940
how much grace can we give here while still,

56
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.840
while still acknowledging that many veterans are hurt by this like genuinely

57
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.180
they're, they're off and maybe they have good reason to be,

58
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.650
but also I don't want to unleash this outrage mob because one, I don't feel it.

59
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.090
You know, I just,

60
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:29.740
I genuinely don't feel like the sense of being offended and that's just not who

61
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:30.490
I am.

62
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.870
And so I don't want to express something that I'm not really feeling either. Um,

63
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.550
which seems to be the norm and the surprising thing about all this was that it

64
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:43.480
was so surprising to people that I wouldn't unleash the outrage mob.

65
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.070
And I said something along, you know, my, my main quote from that was, you know,

66
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.830
a quote that I actually stole from a Harvard professor,

67
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.910
which was a try hard not to offend people, try even harder, not to be offended.

68
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.060
You know, the joke wasn't very funny, but like,

69
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.460
I'm not going to call it for this guy to get fired. I'm not going to like,

70
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.810
you know, demand that everybody cancels Saturday night live. It's just,

71
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.040
it seems, it's just that felt wrong. And so it didn't do it. And, um,

72
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.300
that gave Saturday night live the space to actually apologize the way they want

73
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:14.350
it to and have me on.

74
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.040
And I talk about this in my chive all chapter about the right sense of shame.

75
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.730
And this is the only time I bring up the Saturday night live thing.

76
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.530
And the book that the book kind of came about because of the fame that I got

77
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:30.160
from Saturday night live. But the book isn't really about that, um, it's just,

78
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:31.510
it just so happens that I,

79
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.350
I was directly involved in sort of an outrage culture moment.

80
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.060
And so I decided to write a whole book about the solutions to outrage culture.

81
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:44.050
And, but that moment it takes up like three pages of the book. Um,

82
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.670
not even, um,

83
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.070
but what I point out is that there's a right way to show shame in our culture

84
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.650
and there's a wrong way. And more and more and more,

85
00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:57.580
our culture is going a little wrong way where we have like these two extreme

86
00:04:57.581 --> 00:05:02.290
options on the one hand, people will bow down to the outrage from I'm so sorry.

87
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.830
I can't believe I did that. And I, I bring up some examples in the book, um,

88
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.800
on that, uh, w one w one,

89
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:13.210
because this one just drove me nuts was Mario Lopez when he makes the all to,

90
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.770
uh, understandable comment that three-year-olds should not choose their gender.

91
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.060
I mean, Oh my God can't even,

92
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.980
even believe he said that he got paid for it. Right.

93
00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:26.550
And then, but what does he do? He doesn't say, Hey, hold on,

94
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.350
what's wrong with that? You know, come on guys like that. He doesn't do that.

95
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.070
He says, Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry, please, please forgive me.

96
00:05:35.071 --> 00:05:37.290
Right. That's the wrong sense of shame.

97
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.790
And there's on the other extreme, there's another wrong sense of shame,

98
00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:45.990
which is showing no shame at all. And there's plenty of examples like that,

99
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.810
mostly in the political world, but other,

100
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.720
but in other places as well and other public figures.

101
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.110
And then I diagnosed like the re why is that? Like, why,

102
00:05:55.111 --> 00:05:58.880
why is there this incentive for, or the other? And it's,

103
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.500
and it's an all of us problem.

104
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:04.070
It's not just our terrible politicians or silly celebrities.

105
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.540
It's an all of us problem.

106
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:10.360
We all engage in this shaming in the wrong way. We either, we,

107
00:06:10.361 --> 00:06:14.420
we, we overreact to such an extent that we force people to bow down when they

108
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:15.200
shouldn't,

109
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.100
or we overreact to such an extent that public figures realize there's no

110
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:22.310
incentive to apologize because there's no forgiving. There's no,

111
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.830
there's no redemption. There's no forgetting like,

112
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.040
and so we have to get back to this sort of middle ground and people.

113
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.400
And there's good examples that I bring up in the book of that good middle ground

114
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.610
too. Um, and we,

115
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.460
we just have to do more of that and be more nuanced in our thinking nuances,

116
00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:40.460
like a huge part of solving this problem.

117
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:41.890
<v 2>Yeah. So you,</v>

118
00:06:41.891 --> 00:06:46.090
you go back on SNL and there's humor and there's nuance and decency and all of

119
00:06:46.091 --> 00:06:48.790
those things and that kind of propels you. And one of the things,

120
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.370
things that I think is sort of interesting about you is it's like,

121
00:06:51.371 --> 00:06:55.630
we've sort of got these cartoon characters on the left with the squad,

122
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.500
like AOC and Alon Omar, and to leave and a couple others.

123
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.830
And then there's sort of you on the other side of that. And when you,

124
00:07:02.831 --> 00:07:05.740
when you take you and the eyepatch, there's sort of like,

125
00:07:05.741 --> 00:07:07.270
you're kind of like Nick fury,

126
00:07:07.271 --> 00:07:10.210
like if we're looking at this through a marble lens, it's like,

127
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.860
there's as we should, as we should. Right. I mean, but I mean,

128
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:14.561
we're sort of like,

129
00:07:14.561 --> 00:07:18.040
there's like all the politicians now it's soil and Trump and everybody has sort

130
00:07:18.041 --> 00:07:21.970
of like characters in a movie or in a video game or something like that.

131
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.830
But I mentioned this because it's like,

132
00:07:23.831 --> 00:07:27.550
it seems like there's this young crew from the lefties,

133
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.010
and then there's sort of you on the other side of that,

134
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.340
are there some other guys that you got guys, girls, whatever that,

135
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.360
that you think are in your crew that are sort of the younger more,

136
00:07:37.361 --> 00:07:40.870
get it more willing to open up, talk about these things. I mean, I, you know,

137
00:07:40.871 --> 00:07:42.850
I've done events with you where like, you know,

138
00:07:42.851 --> 00:07:46.960
you can be out there with the students and it's not this stuffy thing,

139
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.050
but it seems like it's kind of just you holding that for the,

140
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.920
for the sort of new, more, maybe open-minded conservative, something like that.

141
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:55.870
Yeah.

142
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.140
<v 0>That's a good question. I do get asked that a lot. And, um,</v>

143
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.490
it's a difficult question because like,

144
00:08:00.491 --> 00:08:04.420
I don't want to try and analyze the minds of my colleagues who maybe don't put

145
00:08:04.421 --> 00:08:07.210
themselves out there as much. I think maybe a lot would be willing to,

146
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:11.950
but they don't have the same ability to, or they're not sure how, um,

147
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.790
there's some really great members of Congress who are, who are our age, um,

148
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.570
you know, uh, like Mike Gallagher, at least to phonic and, uh,

149
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.110
they're out there, but you know, they, they, they, they have their own style.

150
00:08:23.111 --> 00:08:26.890
They're not on social media the way I am. They're not out there the way I am.

151
00:08:26.891 --> 00:08:30.040
Everybody does have their own style. Um,

152
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:34.270
I'm excited about sort of a new squad coming out of Texas. Uh, we,

153
00:08:34.271 --> 00:08:38.830
we've got a lot of great new, um, candidates running, a very diverse set,

154
00:08:38.831 --> 00:08:42.850
very young. Uh, I I'm really excited about it. Um, you know,

155
00:08:42.851 --> 00:08:44.740
I've got Wesley hunt here next to me.

156
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:49.750
African-American army helicopter pilot got Tony Gonzalez running for Willard's

157
00:08:49.751 --> 00:08:54.400
seat, uh, old master chief, not, not old, sorry, but prior master chief,

158
00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:59.130
um, you know, Beth van Dyne, she's a prior mayor again, young,

159
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:03.690
like got a lot of like very intelligent, got a lot of spunk, um, uh, Genevieve,

160
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:09.060
Colin's another great one. Again, young woman millennial like me, um, you know,

161
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.030
very successful, got a great shot at that seat. There's,

162
00:09:12.031 --> 00:09:14.910
there's a lot of really good, uh, candidates.

163
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:19.680
I think the Republican party does have a chance to like really remake itself,

164
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:24.270
um, in, in a really big way that that connects with a lot of different people.

165
00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:25.710
So I'm, uh, I'm excited about it.

166
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:27.500
<v 2>Yeah. Is the biggest challenge there,</v>

167
00:09:27.501 --> 00:09:31.880
just getting over sort of the old stereotypes. I mean, just the old stereotypes,

168
00:09:31.881 --> 00:09:35.780
conservatives care about money and care about war and re you know,

169
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.750
Democrats like poor people and peace,

170
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:43.010
like these basic sort of very factory setting things. When, when in reality,

171
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.220
I mean, we spoke at the turning point student action summit,

172
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.970
and Trump spoke that morning and it was right after the, uh,

173
00:09:49.971 --> 00:09:53.390
the impeachment hearing. And you want it to get up in the middle of his speech.

174
00:09:53.391 --> 00:09:56.360
You were trying to show him your vote, that you voted against it.

175
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.820
And it was like, it was a totally impromptu moment.

176
00:09:58.821 --> 00:10:02.270
Trump looks at you in the crowd. He's like, Dan, come on up here. The secret,

177
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.520
the secret service guys were all looking like, Oh God,

178
00:10:04.521 --> 00:10:07.670
now we have to get this guy from the crowd, even though he's a Congressman,

179
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.950
get him on stage. But, but my,

180
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.890
my broader point is that it was like fun and real,

181
00:10:12.891 --> 00:10:17.630
which is so the reverse of what politics is presented to us

182
00:10:17.631 --> 00:10:18.464
as.

183
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:19.700
<v 0>Yeah. Oh yeah. I mean,</v>

184
00:10:19.701 --> 00:10:24.170
it's totally changed in the last few years and I think it's exciting now we have

185
00:10:24.171 --> 00:10:28.670
to be responsible with, with how we manage this new train.

186
00:10:28.671 --> 00:10:33.260
That's just like lurching forward, right? Because it is this sort of, uh,

187
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:38.090
interesting combination of like showmanship, uh,

188
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.390
with, with some deep thinking and some,

189
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.350
some real actual statesmanship. Um,

190
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.830
it is up to us as leaders to make sure that we,

191
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:51.550
that we maintain those bonds and,

192
00:10:51.551 --> 00:10:54.200
and mend them in a very coherent way.

193
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:57.680
<v 2>If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics,</v>

194
00:10:57.681 --> 00:11:01.010
