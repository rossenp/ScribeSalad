1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.810
<v 0>Why couldn't we get enough masks? Why couldn't we get enough ventilators?</v>

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.230
Why weren't there? The perception that there wasn't enough hospital beds,

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.340
how come the morgues couldn't keep up and so on and so on. Um,

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.410
how come we couldn't be prepared for this?

5
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.530
And no matter how you look at it at every area,

6
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.990
it was a failure of government.

7
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.630
<v 2>As a Liberty minded person. As you said, if people don't come out of this, uh,</v>

8
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.500
more libertarian, something will have gone wrong. What, what are the,

9
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.750
the proper approaches for a Liberty minded government? So say,

10
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.520
uh, a liberal, libertarian,

11
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:48.470
or classical liberal set of ideas that could get us through something

12
00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:51.980
like this. What should we have done sort of at the beginning,

13
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.530
what should we have done as we're going through it right now?

14
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.200
And what should we be looking at for the future?

15
00:00:57.201 --> 00:01:01.940
If you want to keep people as free as possible while also dealing with something

16
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.280
that we've never dealt with.

17
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.690
<v 0>For Dave, if I were going to summarize my position in a sentence,</v>

18
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.550
it would be something like this,

19
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.560
that medical professionals and the medical industry free of all

20
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.900
restrictions should have been allowed to deal with this virus from the very

21
00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:25.460
beginning, without the intervention of politicians, period. I mean that,

22
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.323
that.

23
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.050
<v 2>It, a red tape, just let them do their thing no more,</v>

24
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.630
no more regulations on experimental treatments, that kind of thing.

25
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.910
<v 0>Yeah. And not only that, but you know, if you think about it, Dave,</v>

26
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.340
a lot of this flattened,

27
00:01:39.341 --> 00:01:43.520
the curve analysis that led to the crackdowns and the mandatory social

28
00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:47.870
distancing and the universal house imprisonment that we're dealing with right

29
00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:48.950
now, um,

30
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.900
was due to the perception that the medical industry was unscalable in the event

31
00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:55.100
of emergency. Now,

32
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:59.810
that's very interesting why people need to be asked question if it's

33
00:01:59.811 --> 00:02:03.590
true, why was an industry unable to scale

34
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.940
industry is specialized in scaling. You know, when,

35
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:11.750
when people buy more of your product as an industry,

36
00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:15.260
you're excited to offer more of that product or service to them.

37
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.860
What makes the medical industry unique in that respect?

38
00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:22.550
Why couldn't we get enough masks? Why couldn't we get enough ventilators?

39
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.000
Why weren't there? The perception that there wasn't enough hospital beds,

40
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.080
how come the morgues couldn't keep up and so on and so on. Um,

41
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.180
how come we couldn't be prepared for this?

42
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.300
And no matter how you look at it at every area,

43
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.070
it was a failure of government. It was, the system was, was,

44
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.880
was heavily regulated. Uh, the strategic medical reserve,

45
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.400
disincentivized hospitals from it, from gathering their own, uh, supplies,

46
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.940
the tariffs on masks it's seriously inhibited.

47
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.530
And this is very personal to me because I have friends in New York who are

48
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.330
nurses and doctors who are resharing mass. I can't get enough.

49
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:05.080
And the tariff seriously injured that, um,

50
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.530
and the hospitals didn't have enough supplies on hand cause they assumed that it

51
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:11.050
was all there. The federal government was putting it all together,

52
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.050
but then of course they opened the warehouse and the half of elevators don't

53
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:17.530
work. You know, the supplies aren't there cause they had previously been,

54
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.540
been depleted. Every area, all you see is government irrationality,

55
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.380
but the inability of hospitals to scale the panic or the political class to

56
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.520
force everybody into their homes, which is definitely where you should not be,

57
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.570
whether you have respiratory disease.

58
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.360
The answer is to get outside is everybody understands.

59
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.580
You don't want to put old people with young people.

60
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.400
Cause that causes endless amounts of infections.

61
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:46.540
You actually want to isolate and separate the people who are vulnerable to this

62
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:50.560
disease, which are the old and, and uh, fail. Um,

63
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.610
and um,

64
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.750
the last thing you want to do is close the schools cause COVID,

65
00:03:55.751 --> 00:04:00.730
as we know now is, is, uh, is actually not fatal for,

66
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.750
for young, healthy people. So at every single area, Dave,

67
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.580
the government has done the wrong thing and I don't know how long or how

68
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.810
detailed we want to get here. But the testing fiasco was the great,

69
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.160
I would say beginning of all this stuff, um, because uh,

70
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.430
China had already gone through a trial run of this stuff. You know,

71
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:23.770
we had this benefit of this.

72
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.850
We saw this coming and the CDC and the FDA stopped.

73
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.720
And this is a matter of record, uh, really stopped, uh, private, uh,

74
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.320
researchers from developing the test and distributing the test from the very

75
00:04:35.321 --> 00:04:39.100
beginning of this crisis. That was a catastrophic thing.

76
00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:43.840
And that led to what I've called, pardon me, epistemic crisis.

77
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.280
We didn't know. We didn't know who had it, whether I had it, whether you had it,

78
00:04:48.281 --> 00:04:50.110
what we should do about it, how it was transmitted,

79
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:53.530
who is vulnerable to the fatalities, what the case fatality rate is.

80
00:04:53.531 --> 00:04:54.700
We didn't know anything.

81
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.410
So we replaced knowledge that we could have used with power

82
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.440
and panic. And here we are.

83
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.960
<v 2>So is one of the inherent problems that we have fighting the</v>

84
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.710
bad ideas that would encroach on our rights. That even if you lay out to people,

85
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.010
well, here's all the things that government has done wrong, all the,

86
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.750
all the way. And here's why it can never work properly that they always say,

87
00:05:21.751 --> 00:05:23.130
well, that just means we meet.

88
00:05:23.131 --> 00:05:26.910
We need more government that just needs means we need to give it more money.

89
00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:31.110
So it can be bigger so that we can put more studies out there to make sure it

90
00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:32.310
knows how to do these things.

91
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.210
And that answer always sort of sounds easy and right,

92
00:05:36.211 --> 00:05:40.650
for people that aren't really thinking, it's much harder to say to people, Oh,

93
00:05:40.651 --> 00:05:45.480
the government actually should have been scaled way back on this so we could

94
00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:47.690
have let the professionals deal with it. That,

95
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:49.650
that sort of sounds scary to people,

96
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.480
especially at a time right now where we feel like the future is just up in the

97
00:05:54.481 --> 00:05:58.070
air right now. Yeah. I, and.

98
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.290
<v 0>I think this speaks to a little bit of, uh, something, uh,</v>

99
00:06:01.291 --> 00:06:04.610
a principle that's animated your career in your life,

100
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.640
which you had a passion some years ago,

101
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.470
a realization that people don't appreciate, uh,

102
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.010
freedom.

103
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.810
They don't have confidence and freedom that freedom was being

104
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.490
attacked fundamentally and philosophically by both the left

105
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.980
and, and, and on the right too. And I think you worried about that.

106
00:06:27.981 --> 00:06:31.940
You actually asked yourself a very important question,

107
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.920
what happens, uh, in the event of a crisis where we need freedom more than ever.

108
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.210
And yet we don't have the intellectual foundations in place where there's not a

109
00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:43.490
cultural love of this thing.

110
00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:46.460
We call freedom or an under much less than understanding of it.

111
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.080
What happens then?

112
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:52.340
And I think that was a very interesting perception that you had, um,

113
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:54.261
uh, you know,

114
00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:57.590
several years ago that you really dedicated yourself really hard to this,

115
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:01.700
to this problem and, and, and tried your best to do something about it.

116
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.690
But I think what we're seeing right now are the results of a culture that is

117
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.560
that's, that's forgotten the meaning of freedom, that, that,

118
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.460
and what if you lose that? What do you replace it with?

119
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.740
It's you replace it with the police state with not good with,

120
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:20.803
yeah.

121
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.040
<v 2>So right now, as we, as we sit here,</v>

122
00:07:27.041 --> 00:07:30.130
all sort of trapped in our houses, trying to figure out what to do,

123
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:35.230
how concerned are you about some of those basic freedoms that we're talking

124
00:07:35.231 --> 00:07:38.200
about? I mean, right now, the, the right to assembly, for example,

125
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.720
we cannot assemble together. You know,

126
00:07:40.721 --> 00:07:43.540
you can't get 10 people in a room to do anything. We had our,

127
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.230
our bizarre mayor, um, being nice, uh,

128
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.340
de Blasio in New York city say that if he found temples or churches that were

129
00:07:51.341 --> 00:07:54.790
having any gatherings, they could be permanently closed. Now, again,

130
00:07:54.791 --> 00:07:57.370
I'm all for the, the six foot social distancing,

131
00:07:57.371 --> 00:07:58.930
if that's what the professionals are telling us,

132
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.980
but the idea that we could permanently close these things and we can't assemble

133
00:08:02.981 --> 00:08:06.790
or our right to free speech in that we know that even right now,

134
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.300
big tech is removing blog posts that run counter knowledge.

135
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.440
That's not necessarily, um, the government stepping in and doing it,

136
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.260
but just if we look at just some of our key freedoms, assembly,

137
00:08:17.261 --> 00:08:18.910
and speech being the two at the moment,

138
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.840
how concerned are you that we're just going to sort of put them aside throughout

139
00:08:22.841 --> 00:08:26.050
this, and then it'll be six months later and we'll go, Oh, we had those things.

140
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.400
<v 0>Yeah. I think anything is possible right now, Dave,</v>

141
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.290
and anybody who says otherwise,

142
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.680
hasn't been paying attention over the last couple of weeks. There's no chance.

143
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.250
So I looked, I re before there, before we met up,

144
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.930
just now I looked back at what I wrote January 27th. Cause I, I,

145
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.470
I wrote an article warning that the quarantine power could be used and, and,

146
00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:51.220
and explained why this is a very, very bad idea.

147
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.560
But even in that article, um,

148
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:58.080
I imagined something like this, that,

149
00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.860
that the government would set up like quarantine areas,

150
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.730
which in fact they have done and they would come knocking on your door and grab

151
00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:06.360
people out of it,

152
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.890
maybe one family at a time and put them in there in the quarantine area where

153
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:11.860
you know,

154
00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:16.620
that they would target maybe neighborhoods and round

155
00:09:16.621 --> 00:09:19.560
everybody up and put in Paddy wagons to put them in the quarantine area.

156
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.320
But even January 27th,

157
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:27.150
I never imagined that governments of the world would put everybody

158
00:09:27.151 --> 00:09:31.710
under what amounts to house arrest. So the fact that,

159
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.060
that this has happened, I would say at this point in things anything's possible.

160
00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:40.320
I, I worried cause we put out a book last week called coronavirus and economic

161
00:09:40.321 --> 00:09:44.520
crisis. Um, a book put out by American Institute for economic research.

162
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.850
I put it on Amazon and I got to tell you, I was worried.

163
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:52.430
I was worried that Amazon would take it down. So I printed, uh,

164
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.320
separately some, uh, lots of copies, uh,

165
