WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
<v 0>So I think the first time that I realized I needed to like tangibly do something</v>

2
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:05.500
about it, uh,

3
00:00:05.501 --> 00:00:09.060
which is the movement that'd be called American contingency outside of my own

4
00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:11.820
business was when, uh,

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.260
law enforcement officers in Seattle stopped responding to certain calls

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.760
and that happened. And then they set up this Capitol Hill movement,

7
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:22.350
which became a nightmare.

8
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.000
And they basically allowed for disorderly conduct,

9
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.420
even criminal activity. That was the first time that we went, okay,

10
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:33.120
we need to do something about it. I was just in Portland, Oregon,

11
00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:37.800
about four weeks ago, four weekends ago. Uh, the Portland authority, uh,

12
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.570
didn't respond to 60 calls in a weekend, including larceny burglary,

13
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.900
even reports of rape. And that's mind boggling,

14
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.710
like to think that you could be a law abiding citizen who pays taxes and that

15
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.060
there's a, you know,

16
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.650
a political divisiveness that takes place where it could literally

17
00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:59.520
translate to you not being protected in your own community is disturbing.

18
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.890
<v 1>This week here on the Rubin report.</v>

19
00:01:12.891 --> 00:01:16.700
And I'm doing a bunch of mini interviews with creators who have decided to

20
00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:20.480
become less reliant on big tech and instead own their content,

21
00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:23.210
community and livelihood with locals.com.

22
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.800
Joining me today is the founder of field craft survival and American

23
00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:30.470
contingency. Mike Glover, welcome to the Rubin report.

24
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.680
<v 0>Thanks for having me. It's a pleasure, Mike.</v>

25
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.510
<v 1>I don't know if anyone else on locals has blown this thing</v>

26
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.490
up the way that you have,

27
00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:43.820
you have an absolutely huge community on there.

28
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.330
And I think when we explain to people what it is you do on there,

29
00:01:47.331 --> 00:01:49.400
they'll understand why you're on locals.

30
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.410
So what is the American contingency locals group all about?

31
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.590
<v 0>So I saw an inherent need for bringing people together</v>

32
00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:05.300
without the levels of suppression that are taking place across social media.

33
00:02:05.301 --> 00:02:10.070
So I do own a company called [inaudible] survival that specializes in

34
00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:10.904
preparedness.

35
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.680
And when we started talking about preparedness in different venues,

36
00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:20.360
different settings in training and mindset, audible video, et cetera,

37
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.560
we started realizing that even just talking about preparedness and self-defense

38
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.360
was getting suppressed because it seemed like it was risky or it was too

39
00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:30.170
fringe,

40
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.860
which is surprising to me because I spent my entire life as a Greenbrae and

41
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.650
especially operations. I love America love freedom,

42
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.600
but I love passing information from lessons learned from overseas

43
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.120
to civilians. And so when I started doing that,

44
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.220
I started getting routinely suppressed by every major platform and realize we

45
00:02:49.221 --> 00:02:52.790
needed to look somewhere else at the same time, uh,

46
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.600
socially, uh, we were having problems with, uh,

47
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.970
discourse and w you know,

48
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.250
the breakdown of law and order or politicians and forcing law and order.

49
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.600
And so I realized I needed to provide something that wasn't going to be

50
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:11.860
suppressed. So I reached out to locals and locals became our home.

51
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.410
<v 1>So in essence, you guys are a community of preppers and you're,</v>

52
00:03:15.411 --> 00:03:17.490
you're kind of guiding everybody on,

53
00:03:17.491 --> 00:03:20.760
on some of the tips and tricks of the trade.

54
00:03:20.761 --> 00:03:22.590
And it's kind of funny because you're right. When,

55
00:03:22.591 --> 00:03:25.380
when people think about prepper is the mainstream ideas, Oh,

56
00:03:25.381 --> 00:03:29.460
somehow this is some sort of scary right. Wing something.

57
00:03:29.461 --> 00:03:32.490
And yet we've seen in what, seven months a lockdown,

58
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.030
a lot of people became preppers pretty freaking quick. So you,

59
00:03:36.031 --> 00:03:37.830
you must be feeling kind of good about that.

60
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.380
<v 0>Yeah. Things have obviously changed in our society based on the pandemic,</v>

61
00:03:43.381 --> 00:03:47.910
based on, um, the, the, the drama that's taking place. But we even,

62
00:03:47.911 --> 00:03:49.350
before all this was taking place,

63
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.360
we advocated for people to be self-reliant and that depend on the government

64
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.710
or institutions outside of their control to come and rescue them. You know,

65
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.220
our saying is you are your own first response. Well,

66
00:04:02.221 --> 00:04:07.050
now with the political divisiveness causing first responders to sometimes

67
00:04:07.051 --> 00:04:11.610
never respond, made us realize that, um, not only are your,

68
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.680
are you your own first response,

69
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.370
but you might have to sustain your survivability over time.

70
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.780
So America tendency was that movement to train, to mentor, advise,

71
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.770
and to provide a social network for people to come together and,

72
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.800
and to see it happen almost overnight.

73
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.360
And the engagement that we have was, uh, inspiring to me,

74
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.380
because I realized that maybe we are identifying a problem that the rest or a

75
00:04:37.381 --> 00:04:39.600
lot of Americans are seeing today. Yeah.

76
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.690
<v 1>It's incredible. I'm a member of the community when I've jumped in there,</v>

77
00:04:42.691 --> 00:04:47.310
just to see what the conversation's like. It's like, there's no hate there's no,

78
00:04:47.311 --> 00:04:48.690
there's no anger. There's,

79
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.680
these are good people who are just trying to figure out how to not be so reliant

80
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.260
on the systems that as you, as you kind of said,

81
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.390
they're the systems that seemingly are failing. You know,

82
00:04:57.391 --> 00:05:00.510
if you're calling cops and they're not showing up or whatever it might be, well,

83
00:05:00.511 --> 00:05:02.850
then maybe you do have to take some of this into your own hands. When,

84
00:05:02.851 --> 00:05:05.070
when did you get interested in all of this?

85
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.950
<v 0>So I think the first time that I realized I needed to like tangibly do something</v>

86
00:05:10.951 --> 00:05:11.970
about it, uh,

87
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.510
which is the movement that we called American contingency outside of my own

88
00:05:15.511 --> 00:05:18.300
business was when, uh,

89
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.740
law enforcement officers in Seattle stopped responding to certain calls

90
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.240
and that happened. And then they set up this Capitol Hill movement,

91
00:05:27.241 --> 00:05:28.830
which became a nightmare.

92
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.480
And they basically allowed for disorderly conduct,

93
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.870
even criminal activity. That was the first time that we went, okay,

94
00:05:36.871 --> 00:05:39.600
we need to do something about it. I was just in Portland, Oregon,

95
00:05:39.601 --> 00:05:44.250
about four weeks ago, four weekends ago, uh, the Portland authority, uh,

96
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.050
didn't respond to 60 calls in a weekend, including larceny Burghley,

97
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.410
even reports of rape. And that's mind boggling,

98
00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:55.770
like to think that you could be a law abiding citizen who pays taxes,

99
00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:57.530
and that there's a, you know,

100
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.120
a political divisiveness that takes place where it could literally

101
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:06.020
translate to you not being protected in your own community is disturbing.

102
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.680
So that's what led us down that path. And so far,

103
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:12.230
it's been a positive experience because we, you know,

104
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:16.130
we don't tolerate fringe actors who want to, um,

105
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.330
have their own agendas. What we want is a positive society,

106
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.810
a positive community. And we don't have,

107
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.370
we're not going to tolerate the negative toxic, uh, divisiveness.

108
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.620
That's common today in our society.

109
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.970
<v 1>And our locals, it's your community. And you can do whatever you want with it.</v>

110
00:06:33.971 --> 00:06:38.260
What kind of a censorship stuff were you dealing with on Facebook and some of

111
00:06:38.261 --> 00:06:41.170
the other platforms you kind of alluded to that a moment ago?

112
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.390
<v 0>Yeah. The biggest thing is in the end, the algorithm or the, the,</v>

113
00:06:46.391 --> 00:06:51.280
the system that is Facebook and Instagram, which we had a lot of our platforms,

114
00:06:51.281 --> 00:06:54.910
even my social, my own personal social media influence on, uh,

115
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.900
one of the things that is a metric or a measure for understanding if you're

116
00:06:58.901 --> 00:06:59.734
suppressed,

117
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.570
is the inability for people to organically search you in the search queue via

118
00:07:04.571 --> 00:07:06.730
your name at which is, which is common, right?

119
00:07:06.731 --> 00:07:09.670
Like if you look up right now and I just did this three days ago,

120
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.550
if you look up and T4 the word Antifa,

121
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.220
you will get all the organizations,

122
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.480
including the main pages of Antifa that aren't suppressed that populate in the

123
00:07:19.481 --> 00:07:21.880
queue. If you look up Mike Glover,

124
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:27.100
you will even get the people who are pretending to be in the circle view,

125
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.450
but you will not get me.

126
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:33.070
And that goes for a lot of my friends who are veterans of special operations,

127
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.710
who are conservatives and who aren't fringe,

128
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.250
anybody that are just advocating for the same things we're advocating for. And,

129
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:44.830
and those things are apparent in numbers and analytics and even simple things

130
00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:45.790
like search cute. Yeah.

131
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.970
<v 1>It's incredible what they do. I mean, I got my own version of that. You know,</v>

132
00:07:48.971 --> 00:07:52.270
if you search me, it's like 10 terrible articles coming up first,

133
00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:54.100
all filled with lies, or, you know,

134
00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:55.870
they'll do you probably have one of these too,

135
00:07:55.871 --> 00:07:58.570
when you do people also search for,

136
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.320
and it used to have me associated with all these people I had never heard of who

137
00:08:02.321 --> 00:08:03.850
were these real fringe actors.

138
00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:08.020
Eventually I was able to complain enough that I got some of that stuff fixed,

139
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.280
but, but in essence,

140
00:08:09.281 --> 00:08:12.640
you moved over to locals and you can now do whatever you want with your

141
00:08:12.641 --> 00:08:13.091
community. And,

142
00:08:13.091 --> 00:08:17.110
and it seems to me that the American contingency group that you guys have a

143
00:08:17.111 --> 00:08:20.440
double reason to be there because it's not just that you're preparing for the

144
00:08:20.441 --> 00:08:23.830
worst in, in the real world. Uh,

145
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.110
but you're prepared for the worst in the digital world too.

146
00:08:26.111 --> 00:08:28.540
So it has like a two-pronged piece to it.

147
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.310
<v 0>Yeah, it definitely does what I've realized over time.</v>

148
00:08:33.311 --> 00:08:36.910
And in this short period of time that we've been on locals is that there's a

149
00:08:36.911 --> 00:08:40.630
significant education process that needs to take place.

150
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.260
And not only advocating for platforms like locals,

151
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:48.340
but getting people to try to migrate as a good tenancy. Like I get it.

152
00:08:48.341 --> 00:08:52.840
Like if a lot of your attention span is spent on a platform like Instagram,

153
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.250
that's going to happen because a lot of people were on it.

154
00:08:56.580 --> 00:09:01.170
But if you set in place where you know that you can go suppression free onto

155
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:03.450
that platform, that's a benefit,

156
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.890
a benefit of having this lined out that way with the overall

157
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.390
goal of transferring platforms and people just staying on locals.

158
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:17.310
Like I already know my platform eventually will be shut down. I mean,

159
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:20.850
it's going to happen. And when that happens, we'll do a full migration.

160
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.090
But what I do is I dabble, or I put out, um,

161
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.090
the snippets of information via there. And then I,

162
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.380
I hub my content because I know it's protected. I know it's secure.

163
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.430
And I know it's not going to be moderated or suppressed by people who,

164
00:09:35.431 --> 00:09:37.860
I don't know her, who don't agree with my message.

165
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.650
And that's significant for me as an influencer,

166
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.280
as a business owner and as somebody who wants to create a positive movement,

167
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.710
because now I can operate securely.

168
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:47.601
<v 1>I mean,</v>

169
00:09:47.601 --> 00:09:51.170
I'm thrilled to hear a man because that's exactly why we created this thing.

170
00:09:51.171 --> 00:09:54.230
It's like, it's it's tools for you to do whatever you want.

171
00:09:54.231 --> 00:09:57.260
Can you talk a little bit about the business first cause American contingency

172
00:09:57.261 --> 00:10:01.440
is, is the community part of this, but you had a, you had an, have a,

173
00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:05.030
a pretty successful business before this that's that sort of spurred this all

174
00:10:05.031 --> 00:10:05.864
on.

175
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.720
<v 0>Yeah. So, uh, you know, I I'm I'm open about this,</v>

176
00:10:08.721 --> 00:10:12.500
but I was a special operations guy for nearly my entire life since I was 17

177
00:10:12.501 --> 00:10:15.380
years old. Um, I went to war nine times.

178
00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:18.020
I decided to become a CIA contractor, uh,

179
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.350
known as a global response staff officer. I served overseas,

180
00:10:21.351 --> 00:10:25.790
did five or six additional more rotations in austere environments and

181
00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:28.760
realized, uh, if I wanted to have control of my life,

182
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.900
I couldn't work for the government. I needed to do something different. And, uh,

183
00:10:32.901 --> 00:10:35.060
in Pakistan, on my last rotation,

184
00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:38.630
I decided to start Phil crowd survival also realized that there was a lot of

185
00:10:38.631 --> 00:10:43.400
things that I learned in special operations and process and mindset in

186
00:10:43.401 --> 00:10:47.330
rehearsal and planning and equipment that didn't have to do with specialized

187
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.193
tactics,

188
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:52.490
but just simple processes that civilians would benefit when looking at their

189
00:10:52.491 --> 00:10:56.300
life that not only in preparedness, but just all facets of their life,

190
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.860
even in business. I mean,

191
00:10:57.861 --> 00:11:02.750
I use simple like the five paragraph operations order that I learned as an 18

192
00:11:02.751 --> 00:11:04.220
year old ranger school student.

193
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:09.260
I applied to business because it's a good way to process information and to, uh,

194
00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.280
uh, disseminate that information in business. So feel cross survival.

195
00:11:13.281 --> 00:11:18.170
I've had for about four years now. Um, and we offer training. We have podcasts,

196
00:11:18.171 --> 00:11:22.430
we have free Bible information in the realm of preparedness,

197
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:27.320
trying to kind of get rid of the stereotypes associated with the prepper and

198
00:11:27.321 --> 00:11:30.980
letting people know it doesn't matter what political affiliation or side of the

199
00:11:30.981 --> 00:11:35.600
aisle you're on. What's, what's uh, unique about catastrophe.

200
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.800
It's it, it's an equal opportunity. It doesn't care what color ethnicity,

201
00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.250
or where you come from. It's going to destroy your life all the same.

202
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.170
So if you're prepared, um,

203
00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.030
you'll be better set up for success instead of failure. So that's what we do.

204
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.760
I'm doing it right now in Montana. Uh, I have 20 plus employees.

205
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:56.950
We subcontract and contract all over the United States, teaching civilians,

206
00:11:56.951 --> 00:11:59.410
military, and law enforcement, how to be better prepared.

207
00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:00.090
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

208
00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:03.750
Can you tell people just like a couple of the little tips for the people that

209
00:12:03.751 --> 00:12:07.110
are just sort of waiting into these waters because a lockdown, as we said,

210
00:12:07.111 --> 00:12:09.120
because of seeing violence, things like that, it's interesting.

211
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.490
Cause I never considered myself a prepper.

212
00:12:11.491 --> 00:12:13.410
We do have some emergency kits and stuff like that,

213
00:12:13.411 --> 00:12:18.150
but I always liked having like a lot of canned goods in the basement or in the

214
00:12:18.151 --> 00:12:21.840
pantry, like just, you know, extra water, paper towels, that kind of stuff.

215
00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:24.720
I never thought of it as prepper really, but it was always like, yeah,

216
00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:28.170
all hell broke loose for a couple of days. I'm in the politics world. It's like,

217
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.750
you can't not think of that. Um,

218
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.690
but I think a lot of people are just for the first time ever going, Oh,

219
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.380
you mean I got to not take out from a restaurant every night. You got,

220
00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:40.200
I got to have some food here. I got to have some water here. What are,

221
00:12:40.201 --> 00:12:43.620
what are like some of the one Oh one type things that you recommend to people

222
00:12:43.621 --> 00:12:45.000
when they're just learning about this?

223
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.610
<v 0>Yeah. I think when I look at preparedness, I look at statistical probability.</v>

224
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:55.180
So I don't want to paint a picture like a doomsday scenario. But when you,

225
00:12:55.181 --> 00:12:58.890
you know, when I was asked to two years ago on a podcast with a buddy of mine,

226
00:12:58.891 --> 00:13:02.190
Mike Pfeiffer, he asked me, what is the worst case scenario? And I said,

227
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:07.320
simply the worst case scenario is a large-scale pandemic with social

228
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.820
disruption, chaos, or discourse. And that's exactly what we're facing right now.

229
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:16.440
And it, and it's because, uh, right now when you take and stacks,

230
00:13:16.441 --> 00:13:18.810
social economic issues on top of each other, it,

231
00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:23.580
it destroys the fabric restructure or in our case security that we feel.

232
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.150
So w what people could understand first and foremost,

233
00:13:27.151 --> 00:13:29.160
is that your mindset or your,

234
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:32.700
your level of resilience in your mindset is the most important thing you could

235
00:13:32.701 --> 00:13:34.680
focus on because, you know,

236
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:39.360
disastrous catastrophe come at you in different spurts of time and space.

237
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.820
And if it hits you in the face, like a baseball bat,

238
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:45.240
and sometimes maybe that's literally, then that's a compressed timeline,

239
00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.500
but if you have something like a pandemic, it's a long duration timeline. Well,

240
00:13:49.501 --> 00:13:52.590
ultimately, if you understand how you respond to stress,

241
00:13:52.591 --> 00:13:54.090
because that's what you're reacting to,

242
00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:59.430
then you have a good idea how you're going to manage the process of a disaster

243
00:13:59.431 --> 00:14:03.660
or catastrophe. So it starts with mindset. So ha being healthy,

244
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:09.420
um, making your family healthy, getting sleep, taking care of your immunity,

245
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:14.520
um, eating healthy and getting exercise are basic start points that people would

246
00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:17.550
never consider in a preparedness or prepper movement.

247
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.540
But that's the start point because when you're healthy, physically and mentally,

248
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.350
then you're able to make good cognitive decisions to set your self up for

249
00:14:25.351 --> 00:14:29.400
success. Just a tangible takeaway for your listeners. Um,

250
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.520
tourniquets are one of the most important pieces of equipment that are

251
00:14:32.521 --> 00:14:35.850
neglected. You could die from a, for moral or breakable bleed,

252
00:14:35.851 --> 00:14:38.370
which is a large arterial bleed. In a matter of minutes,

253
00:14:38.371 --> 00:14:41.700
I've seen it on the battlefield. I've even seen it in America, uh,

254
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.210
happened in vehicle accidents, 30,000 people a year in America,

255
00:14:45.211 --> 00:14:46.350
die from car accidents.

256
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:51.620
And it's one simple $29 and 99 cents thing that you could buy online,

257
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.710
get trained, put it in your car, put it in your wife's purse,

258
00:14:54.711 --> 00:14:57.140
put it in your pocket and carry it with you.

259
00:14:57.141 --> 00:15:01.100
Because if you learn to have that lifesaving piece of equipment,

260
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.990
it could save your life. And it's,

261
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:08.180
and it only improves the overall life that you do have because people think that

262
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.300
people who are prepared are paranoid. It's the complete opposite.

263
00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:14.720
When you're prepared, you're not anxious. You're not paranoid.

264
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.120
You're confident and living your life. Yeah.

265
00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.460
<v 1>I love that. And it's just,</v>

266
00:15:18.461 --> 00:15:22.600
it's just so obvious after the last couple months that people who thought about

267
00:15:22.601 --> 00:15:26.020
some of this stuff seriously from taking care of yourself,

268
00:15:26.021 --> 00:15:29.290
physically and mentally, to having some supplies and everything else, they're,

269
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.410
they're in a much better spot than the people that thought that the systems were

270
00:15:32.411 --> 00:15:35.350
always going to exist. Um, well, listen, I was,

271
00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:39.010
I was going to tell you to pimp out the American contingency community,

272
00:15:39.011 --> 00:15:41.770
but I think you've done a hell of a job, uh, doing it, but,

273
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.590
but where can people go to, to join your locals community?

274
00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.920
<v 0>So the best link for us is American</v>

275
00:15:47.921 --> 00:15:52.870
contingency.locals.com. And that's a great start point. Um,

276
00:15:52.871 --> 00:15:54.370
I also have a personal YouTube.

277
00:15:54.371 --> 00:15:57.550
I'm doing this show called living your prep life,

278
00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:59.410
which is a spinoff of living your best life.

279
00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.410
But I think the best life is a prep life. Uh,

280
00:16:02.411 --> 00:16:06.550
you can go to YouTube and find me under my personal was just as simply Mike

281
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.670
Glover, which so far, there's no suppression on that channel.

282
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.430
<v 1>All right, well, Mike, I know my audience is going to love this,</v>

283
00:16:12.431 --> 00:16:15.310
so I want to have you on for a proper hour long, sit down.

284
00:16:15.311 --> 00:16:19.180
So we'll do that over the next month or two, maybe right after the election.

285
00:16:19.181 --> 00:16:22.000
Once we see what level of freak out everybody's in,

286
00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.340
I might need some personal advice myself.

287
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.160
<v 0>I would love that it would be an honor. All right.</v>

288
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.660
<v 1>Thanks, man. Well, I really appreciate it.</v>

289
00:16:28.661 --> 00:16:31.300
