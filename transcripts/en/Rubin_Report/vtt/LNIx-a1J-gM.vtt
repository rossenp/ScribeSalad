1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.650
<v 0>What's happened is tragically. We had created a tremendous segregation.</v>

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.610
Yeah, well, a new underclass, if you will, uh, an immigrant's underclass,

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.720
which Sweden never had, and we don't know how to deal with it. Um,

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.680
we're also running out of money because we have the most expensive welfare

5
00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:19.540
system in the world, and now we're trying to deal with it.

6
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.670
Nobody knows what to do.

7
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.090
<v 1>Can you guys explain a little bit about how the immigration</v>

8
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.280
issue arose that basically this all started just in the last really seven

9
00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:35.360
years, something like that,

10
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.440
that a pretty much homogenous society for better or worse

11
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.590
decided I think, but correct me if I'm wrong.

12
00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:46.370
I think probably with good intentions by people that weren't thinking that much

13
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.200
to bring in a ton of people.

14
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.280
How many immigrants roughly have come in over the last half decade or so.

15
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.630
<v 0>Or if you take it over a decade, um,</v>

16
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.170
the numbers are always changing because they're playing around with them.

17
00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:03.200
So it depends on how you kind of calculate it, but it is,

18
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:04.760
it is a bit over a million.

19
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.960
<v 1>So, okay. So roughly a 10th of the population came in,</v>

20
00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:12.950
let's say in the last decade from these countries, um,

21
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.820
what do you think the leaders thought exactly was going to happen?

22
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.350
Let's say well-intentioned but do you think maybe I'm giving them too much?

23
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.070
<v 0>No, no.</v>

24
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.310
Let's let's do the well intention because I like to give people the benefit of

25
00:01:25.311 --> 00:01:26.144
the doubt. Yeah.

26
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.800
I think they were hoping for a multicultural nearby now with,

27
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.660
you know, kebabs, you know, and some belly dancing. Yeah.

28
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.650
<v 1>And a lot of smoked fish. You guys are killing it in the smoked fish game,</v>

29
00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:42.320
by the way, eat some delicious out of that is true.

30
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.940
<v 0>Yeah. But other than that,</v>

31
00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:48.380
I think the idea is if you live in a culture that is so

32
00:01:48.381 --> 00:01:53.330
homogenous as Sweden is you cannot think outside the box of our own culture.

33
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.700
They don't even perceive that we have a culture.

34
00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.710
They probably believe they will become suites very quickly when they

35
00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:02.540
realize how right and good we are.

36
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.820
<v 2>Yes, they will. Didn't happen.</v>

37
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.030
<v 1>Cool. Yeah. So if we were not to give them the benefit of the doubt,</v>

38
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:09.140
because I also,

39
00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:12.020
I try not to go to people's motives and I think the road to hell is paved with

40
00:02:12.021 --> 00:02:12.651
good intentions.

41
00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:15.290
And I think a lot of these people think they're doing the right thing, but,

42
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.870
but let's go to the non good motive part.

43
00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.750
I think you just wrote a book about it. I mean, what,

44
00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:23.240
what do you think these people thought they were doing?

45
00:02:23.241 --> 00:02:27.170
Or what do you think they thought was going to happen just when you change

46
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.700
demographics that much a 10th of a population is a huge, huge, huge amount.

47
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.700
<v 2>Well, I think they wanted to him.</v>

48
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.030
So the social Democrat came into power. Uh,

49
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.710
they actually lifted up the working class to a, a much better living standard.

50
00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:46.490
And the idea was, as soon as we get them up to middle-class living standards,

51
00:02:46.491 --> 00:02:49.820
they will become true communists and understand that they need to devote

52
00:02:49.821 --> 00:02:51.110
everything to the struggle.

53
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.670
What happened in reality was that they were perfectly fine with their flat

54
00:02:55.671 --> 00:02:59.380
screen TVs. They wanted more flat-screen TVs and longer vacation time.

55
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:04.240
They didn't want to join a communist revolution. They became in essence, uh,

56
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.330
well, our equivalent of Republicans, I suppose.

57
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.620
So they needed new voters in a sense. And they invoked.

58
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.110
And then they took in a lot of people into the most over-regulated labor market

59
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:19.090
in the world. And these people,

60
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.670
second generation and third generation immigrants.

61
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.930
They're not getting into the system. They're keeping them, uh, for the ballots.

62
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:29.380
They want their votes and they, and they keep them on subsidies. Um,

63
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.460
some of these kids,

64
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:33.790
they see that the system is rigged against them and they have no choice.

65
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:35.770
They will, of course they will become gangsters.

66
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.280
They will go off and fight for ISIS after a while. Not all of them, obviously.

67
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.400
<v 0>It gets important that at this point to remember that the people that</v>

68
00:03:44.401 --> 00:03:47.970
came in, you know, those individuals,

69
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.090
it's not their fault inherent.

70
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.960
<v 2>They weren't invited. Well,</v>

71
00:03:51.961 --> 00:03:55.200
that's why I asked about the intentions and good or bad of the people that

72
00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:56.034
brought them in. Not.

73
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.570
<v 0>No, I like to think, you know, crowds always go crazy. Um,</v>

74
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.560
but individuals are much more reasonable. You know, somebody has, you know,

75
00:04:04.561 --> 00:04:07.680
fleeing a war or, you know, I have the deepest sympathy. Yes,

76
00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:11.190
of course I would do the same thing, but it is irresponsible.

77
00:04:11.191 --> 00:04:15.420
If you have a so regulated labor market and you,

78
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.510
you take in more people than you can help. It.

79
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.990
That's just like you were throwing a party that goes haywire on Facebook.

80
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.340
Everyone was invited, uh, you know, I have drinks where 12 people.

81
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.960
<v 2>W what, what did they think that people were going to do? Like,</v>

82
00:04:27.961 --> 00:04:30.030
what kind of jobs did they think people were going to have?

83
00:04:30.031 --> 00:04:33.000
Or did they immediately say you're taking care of for a year? You know,

84
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:34.200
we hear these stories out of German.

85
00:04:34.201 --> 00:04:36.960
Government wants to start a camel farm in Gothenburg.

86
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.830
That was one of the one experiment for some. And that's, uh, yeah,

87
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.020
that was crazy. Um, that actually sort of racing and sort of racist,

88
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.740
but no, we can't give you a proper job, but we'll give you some,

89
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.500
sub-studies start to camel farm. You shouldn't be good at that.

90
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.240
And also we have plenty of cameras in Sweden. No, we don't truly,

91
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.270
the people come in. And as you said, they're often fleeing war.

92
00:05:00.271 --> 00:05:02.730
You have sympathies with all these people. The government then says,

93
00:05:02.731 --> 00:05:06.450
here's some stuff, but you can't be forever.

94
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.160
Although they sort of do have it forever,

95
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.370
but not just that you can't have it forever. It's a limited amount of stuff.

96
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.700
Right. We can't put you and then, then they can turn around and say, see,

97
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:17.590
we're also racist because we didn't make you millionaires at night one.

98
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.410
And exactly, they get a flat, they get a, a minimum, uh,

99
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.810
uh, living subsidy subsidy, uh, but, and then, uh,

100
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.410
they are expected to vote left. And that is what it looks like.

101
00:05:31.411 --> 00:05:36.180
If you break down the statistics of different municipalities and how they

102
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.520
vote. I mean, in the roofs, in Guatemala,

103
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.320
it was like eight 70 to 90% worth it for the social Democrats or the lefts.

104
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.110
<v 0>Yes. Yes. I mean, there, there, you know, we have the numbers for all of that,</v>

105
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.720
but what what's happened is tragically.

106
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.580
We had created a tremendous segregation. Yeah. Well, a new underclass,

107
00:05:53.581 --> 00:05:56.940
if you will, uh, an immigrant's underclass, which Sweden never,

108
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.600
and we don't know how to deal with it.

109
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.770
And we're also running out of money because we have the most expensive welfare

110
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:07.610
system in the world. And now we're trying to deal with it. Nobody knows what to.

111
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.660
<v 2>Th this is, uh, sort of dangerous question in a way,</v>

112
00:06:10.661 --> 00:06:13.540
but I think these conversations always end up here, which is,

113
00:06:13.541 --> 00:06:18.010
do you think in a weird way, this then breeds racism? Yes. That,

114
00:06:18.011 --> 00:06:22.690
that good intentioned people, right? You, I mean, you just made it very clear.

115
00:06:22.691 --> 00:06:24.550
You have no ill will towards these people,

116
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.430
but then these people come into these countries. They're given these things,

117
00:06:27.431 --> 00:06:28.330
they demand more,

118
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.530
the politicians use them for votes and then good people who are not racist,

119
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.500
but maybe don't have a lot of time to think about all these things suddenly

120
00:06:35.501 --> 00:06:40.150
start becoming kind of racist. It's just, it's just a sad fact that humanity.

121
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.680
Absolutely. And I think it goes both ways. I think the Swedes wanted to invite,

122
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.980
uh,

123
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.400
poor people from the third world to come and live in Sweden because they wanted

124
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:51.310
to feel good themselves. But, uh,

125
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.700
also they thought everyone would want to become Swedish, of course.

126
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.180
But then they get a lot of immigrants and the immigrants look at the Swedish

127
00:06:58.181 --> 00:07:00.380
society and they're like, well, maybe I'm,

128
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:05.050
I'm going to keep some of my own culture because I don't think this is so great.

129
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.160
And if you were to sort of,

130
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.180
and also if you keep them out of the system and you never left them in and you

131
00:07:10.181 --> 00:07:13.330
stick them in ghettos, uh, of course they will start to hit you.

132
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.360
And there's a weird thing that I think Europe has that America doesn't have,

133
00:07:16.361 --> 00:07:20.890
which is that if you were to assimilate them more sort of push more of a Swedish

134
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.880
culture on them, that would be against Swedish nature in a bizarre way.

135
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.650
We're America. We have a melting pot here.

136
00:07:26.651 --> 00:07:29.350
So come here with all of your traditions and all of those things,

137
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.900
but mix into the fabric of America where Europe has more of a

138
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:35.703
ghettoization, okay.

139
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.230
<v 0>This, I think the recent America can,</v>

140
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:43.000
can do this better is because your country is founded on the principle of

141
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.100
individuality and individuals.

142
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:50.440
Whereas Sweden is founded on the idea of collectivism and that

143
00:07:50.441 --> 00:07:53.770
makes it really hard to break the molds. Now I have a good friend.

144
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.180
Who's he's work. He's doing a lot of work with newly arrived, uh,

145
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.620
African boys. And like the top question. This is most often Shiri. The,

146
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.130
the question he is most often asked by these guys is like,

147
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.790
how do I make Swedish friends? I don't know. They never open up.

148
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.600
I'm never in touch with them. And at the same time, I mean, this is like, again,

149
00:08:13.601 --> 00:08:15.970
bringing tears to my eyes. They want to work.

150
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.350
They want to break into becoming useful. Uh, at the same time,

151
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.230
suites will be telling you, Oh no, how, how you should behave. No,

152
00:08:23.231 --> 00:08:25.750
I couldn't possibly tell you just be, be yourself.

153
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:30.250
And by they give nothing away because they don't understand being so

154
00:08:30.251 --> 00:08:35.200
collectivist. Like we have a very closed, very complicated culture.

155
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:40.000
And if we want to invite people into our culture, we need to start, you know,

156
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:45.130
you're here, we do it this way. This is, you know, but that is considered,

157
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.860
um, almost racist, certainly socially aggressive to tell people that,

158
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.440
well, this is how we do things around here. We take off.

159
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.270
<v 2>Our shoes before we call them coming. Someone's home. That is quite unique.</v>

160
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.490
Yeah. Yeah. It's, I'll send the Japanese,

161
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.970
although we're more sloppy than the Japanese, I think, uh,

162
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.060
because there are unwritten rules. Of course there are,

163
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:07.500
but for the longest time,

164
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:11.040
Swedes denied that because it would be racist to admit we had our own culture.

165
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.240
<v 1>Can you guys talk a little bit about how,</v>

166
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:17.570
how you differentiate from some of the other Nordic countries?

167
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:20.600
Because as I said, we always point to the Nordic countries,

168
00:09:20.601 --> 00:09:23.240
but Sweden is the one that we really focus on. Um,

169
00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:24.770
but it sounds from what I could tell,

170
00:09:24.771 --> 00:09:29.150
and I did visit Denmark and I visited Finland and, uh, at a couple other places,

171
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.450
um, Denmark doesn't seem to have the problems as much.

172
00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.950
<v 2>As well. They did up until they had those cartoonists scandals.</v>

173
00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:39.740
And then they sort of understood what it was all about.

174
00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:41.450
If you can't criticize Mohammed,

175
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.440
that's basically blasphemy laws and no modern Western state would stand for

176
00:09:45.441 --> 00:09:46.130
that.

177
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.820
