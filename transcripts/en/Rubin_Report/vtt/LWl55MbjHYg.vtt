00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.550
<v 0>New pushback against cancel culture.</v>

2
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:15.390
And it comes from some prominent liberal figures with J K Rowling,

3
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.950
Gloria Steinem, Noam, Chomsky,

4
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:21.720
and others signing an open letter published by Harper's calling for openness to

5
00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:26.100
opposing views. Joining me now is Dave Rubin hosted the Rubin report.

6
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.340
Um, it's pretty fascinating this whole episode,

7
00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:33.270
because as soon as the letter comes out, you had people apologize.

8
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.720
I just want to read one of these tweets to you from Jennifer Finney Boylan,

9
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.400
who had signed the letter. And she said, I did not know who else had signed it.

10
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.080
I thought I was endorsing a well-meaning if vague message against internet

11
00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:47.610
shaming. I did know Trotsky,

12
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:50.160
Steinem and Atwood were in and I thought good company,

13
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.520
but the consequences are mind to bear. And I am so sorry.

14
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.440
So she canceled herself, Dave.

15
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.320
<v 1>Oh, the web we weave when we decide to cancel everybody, I mean,</v>

16
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.920
look, it's nice. We're all glad to see it. Right.

17
00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:10.850
It's nice to see liberals finally coming around and realizing, Oh,

18
00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:13.820
cancel culture. Isn't about just taking out conservatives.

19
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.240
It might take them out to, uh, but for the record, I've,

20
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:20.690
there's a couple people who signed this thing. Who've tried to cancel me.

21
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.700
So it's nice.

22
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.960
But ultimately it's just a bunch of words and I don't see the radicals looking

23
00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:30.860
at this thing and going, okay, let's wrap up, cancel culture. If anything,

24
00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:34.550
they've proven here that they're going to keep attacking and people that have

25
00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:36.170
signed it are going to back out.

26
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.960
<v 0>Do you think that anyone that signed this letter would defend conservatives that</v>

27
00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:42.794
are attacked?

28
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.470
<v 1>Sure. There's a couple of people on there who would,</v>

29
00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:50.810
and I'm sure there's a couple of people on there who have,

30
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.780
but for the most part, no. I mean, look,

31
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.810
every one of the people that's on that list. When they,

32
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.770
when the mob comes for them, it's going to be the lefty mob.

33
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.690
It's not going to be the Trump supporters.

34
00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:05.960
It's not going to be the scary conservatives or anyone on the right.

35
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.740
It's going to be the lefties that come for their schools that come for their

36
00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:13.430
jobs that come for their homes and their families. So again,

37
00:02:13.431 --> 00:02:18.260
this is them just kind of protecting their last bastion of freedom,

38
00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:21.200
but they should have been protecting a lot of other people before this.

39
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.370
<v 0>You saw it coming. You wrote the book, don't burn this book.</v>

40
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.130
I wish.

41
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.990
<v 1>I was wrong, Dana. Honestly, I really do.</v>

42
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.940
<v 0>Yeah, well, you're not wrong. And you're always welcome here on the show.</v>

43
00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:37.130
We appreciate it. Dave Rubin and hope that Clyde,

44
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.980
your puppy is sitting by your feet there. Thank you.
