00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.410
<v 0>My default settings, factory settings were just, you know,</v>

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.010
pro choice. Um, Republicans are evil.

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.290
All they care about is money. You're the good you're the good.

4
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.110
<v 1>Democrats are nice. They care about pork.</v>

5
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.603
<v 2>Cool.</v>

6
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.410
<v 0>We make a lot of inappropriate jokes and I'm, you know,</v>

7
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:27.890
we were joking on this week. So I'm like, Whoa. Maggie was saying, Oh,

8
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.520
who's going to want to sponsor this show because I said something like I was

9
00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:36.410
joking about, um, how the golden gloves went vegan.

10
00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.900
And I was like, I just missed the good old days. Right. You know,

11
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.830
a man could be a man and a woman was in the kitchen and Maggie's like, Jesus,

12
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.180
you can't make even jokes like that because someone will clip that and then say,

13
00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:49.850
see, here is Bridgette with her internalized patriarchy.

14
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.660
<v 1>Unless you say that everyone from the 1950s was a racist bigot,</v>

15
00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:55.100
homophobe you're canceled.

16
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.290
<v 0>I, yeah, but is it,</v>

17
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.510
should we just pre cancel because comedy is, I think saying, you know,

18
00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:04.400
I said something that was really,

19
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.730
it's always those off the cuff jokes that you make that are completely

20
00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:08.690
inappropriate.

21
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.580
That I think I said something about Cardi B and we were filming and the

22
00:01:13.581 --> 00:01:16.850
dumpster fire witch. And I said, you know,

23
00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:20.440
she said threatened to go to Nigeria. And I sat up, I was like, ah,

24
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.430
have fun with Boko or I'm. And Maggie and Sam who are in there filming with me,

25
00:01:25.431 --> 00:01:28.280
my, my cousin, Maggie, who's my producing partner.

26
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.390
And Samantha who's also on the team. They'd started dying,

27
00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:33.830
laughing because it's, that's,

28
00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:36.020
what's funny is those things that are off the cuff.

29
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.210
And if you say something like that now,

30
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.350
and you aren't in a position like I'm in, which is, um,

31
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.490
slightly immune to cancel culture,

32
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.790
you will get canceled or you're in risk of getting canceled.

33
00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:54.560
So I think comedy has become a lot more afraid. And then, you know,

34
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:58.010
the argument that people say is like, cancel culture. Isn't real.

35
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.990
Is that people like Ricky, Jarvis and Dave Chappelle are making jokes. Well,

36
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.310
they're millionaires, they're multimillionaire powerful. So you're just,

37
00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:10.580
you can't use people who are even J K Raleigh.

38
00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:14.690
You can't use billionaires and multimillionaires as examples of people who are,

39
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.280
who are canceled proof because they're canceled. Proved just because they're.

40
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.800
<v 1>Do you sense though, that people like us, maybe, uh, if,</v>

41
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.660
if Jervais is and Chappelle,

42
00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:28.030
let's say you're doing it at like the air force level that were sort of more of

43
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.750
the foot soldiers in this or something like,

44
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:31.280
or we're in the tanks on the ground.

45
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.750
And we're offering cover to the average person that is the foot soldier in this

46
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:37.640
that just wants to be able to work a real job,

47
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.300
but still occasionally say what they think without being mobbed. And we're,

48
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:43.850
we are actually offering them a little bit of cover. Yeah.

49
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.460
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. I think that people,</v>

50
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.680
people feel confused and there is that sense of,

51
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.500
um, terror that's but also hilarious.

52
00:02:57.501 --> 00:02:59.770
And we were talking about this as well. Dumpster fire,

53
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:02.140
just how it's you're you're,

54
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.130
it's almost like a defense humor for me as a defense mechanism.

55
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:07.480
It is for many people.

56
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.450
And that's why inappropriate jokes are funny because you're like

57
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.360
world war three, right guys.

58
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:16.570
And then the memes come out in the memes are hilarious.

59
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.610
And so people are using humor to try and make sense of a world that's really

60
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:26.200
crazy. And then you have all these people who are experts. And I always say,

61
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:31.030
no one knows anything. I mean, even experts, they might know things about,

62
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.860
they might have things to contribute, but no one knows what's going to happen.

63
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.900
So anyone who's telling you like here's,

64
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:42.490
what's going to happen is really just projecting their own

65
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:46.210
biases and hopes into the world. But no one is like,

66
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.550
no stir Domus they're not gonna.

67
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.300
So I think people just want to laugh to make sense.

68
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.450
<v 1>You mentioned your, uh, factory settings, uh,</v>

69
00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.970
which I have credited you with.

70
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.560
<v 0>Thank you. I really appreciate that.</v>

71
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.640
<v 1>9% Sure. I credited you when I mentioned it in the book, I suddenly,</v>

72
00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:07.980
as I'm saying, and I suddenly afraid that I didn't, but, um,

73
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.790
but let it be known that you were the first person that came up with the phrase

74
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.290
fractory settings that I had ever heard.

75
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.970
Can you just explain what factory settings are?

76
00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:15.930
I know we talked about it last time,

77
00:04:15.931 --> 00:04:20.850
but I think it's such a right way of sort of looking at why everything is so

78
00:04:20.851 --> 00:04:21.684
screwed up or,

79
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.840
or sort of how you would take everything down to first principles to then sort

80
00:04:24.841 --> 00:04:25.674
of look at.

81
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.640
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

82
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.350
Factory settings is really just the default that you were kind of

83
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.710
installed as a child. For instance,

84
00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:37.560
I was raised in a very liberal family.

85
00:04:37.561 --> 00:04:41.220
It was very East coast. We, I didn't,

86
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.900
I was thinking about the other day, I'm like,

87
00:04:42.901 --> 00:04:47.670
I don't think I even met anyone who was pro-life until I was in my

88
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.590
third on Twitter. Yeah. Maybe. I mean, it might've been,

89
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.570
I just was not exposed to, I didn't. I was in Minnesota,

90
00:04:57.571 --> 00:05:02.100
but we lived in the city. So I was always very much in, and again,

91
00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:05.850
I wasn't really, you know, engaging in the debate club at school.

92
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.480
So I didn't, I had some conservatives in my life,

93
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.250
but my default settings, factory settings were just, you know,

94
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.880
pro choice. Um, Republicans are evil.

95
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.350
All they care about is money. You're the good, you're the good guy.

96
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.030
<v 1>Democrats are nice. They care about poor people. Do you think so,</v>

97
00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:29.910
do you think that's a personal thing or that generally when I,

98
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.310
when I've used the phrase, maybe this is my own take on it.

99
00:05:32.311 --> 00:05:35.760
I've sort of said to people that the factory settings that we're all given

100
00:05:35.761 --> 00:05:40.350
pretty much, if you grow up in America or, you know, in the last 40 years,

101
00:05:40.351 --> 00:05:43.560
let's say, is that, that is the narrative. So yes, of course,

102
00:05:43.561 --> 00:05:45.900
some people are brought up say Christian conservative and they're brought up

103
00:05:45.901 --> 00:05:50.220
pro-life or whatever, but that's really, that's really an outlier, right?

104
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.820
To the main set of ideas that are sort of accepted out of the gate,

105
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:58.790
which are Democrats, good Republicans, bad Democrats for poor people,

106
00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:02.750
Republicans for rich people, Democrats, you know, all of that kind of stuff.

107
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.150
<v 0>It depends on where you grow up because I think everyone's factory settings are</v>

108
00:06:07.151 --> 00:06:10.780
different and that, and it depends on your region.

109
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.740
So if I was raised in, you know, somewhere in the South, perhaps,

110
00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:19.720
or in Texas or in a different family than perhaps I would have different

111
00:06:19.721 --> 00:06:24.130
factory settings, um, my very good friend is,

112
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.850
was raised conservative. And he was raised to think all liberals are right

113
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:34.690
and lefties and that they,

114
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.580
you know, can't, can't argue any of their own points. They, they,

115
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:40.360
so he,

116
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.340
he just won't even really engage in a leftist debate because he,

117
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.270
he thinks that that was the way he was raised by his family that was

118
00:06:49.271 --> 00:06:50.110
conservative,

119
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.940
but it was also known that they were not the mainstream

120
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.100
point of view or right.

121
00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.480
<v 1>That set of ideas.</v>

122
00:06:58.481 --> 00:07:02.740
Wasn't the thing coming down to you from Hollywood and the media all the time.

123
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.220
Right.

124
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.960
<v 0>And to kind of keep those ideas somewhat on the down low.</v>

125
00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:11.290
So even in graduate school, he had to,

126
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.250
he's had to kind of pretend just fake,

127
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.630
go along with a lot of the crazy stuff that he's seen and

128
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.410
just because he wants to kind of swim through and get done and,

129
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:28.390
and be done with it. But, so I think that's interesting too.

130
00:07:28.391 --> 00:07:31.060
I don't know. I I've, I've been,

131
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.710
it's been interesting hearing from as many conservatives as I have in the past

132
00:07:35.711 --> 00:07:40.330
couple of years, their own struggles at colleges and how they're kind of these,

133
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.510
you know, they're outliers really in the culture. And I didn't,

134
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.370
I never knew that cause it was just like, whatever. Give me the weed.

135
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.360
<v 1>For a second though, because that is relative to all this,</v>

136
00:07:52.361 --> 00:07:55.510
for people that don't know you or didn't see our first interview,

137
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:56.830
you're a former addict,

138
00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:02.350
which I think in a lot of ways seems to set up sort of your view on all of this,

139
00:08:02.351 --> 00:08:06.430
that this isn't, that the culture war for as important as it is. Right.

140
00:08:06.431 --> 00:08:07.960
And this is what we do every day.

141
00:08:07.961 --> 00:08:12.280
And I do believe that this fight is the fight for Western

142
00:08:12.281 --> 00:08:14.620
values and all of these things like it is important,

143
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.690
but that you've already lived through like your own existential

144
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.590
battle for existence. Right.

145
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.900
<v 0>I feel like that, you know, I grew up in a kind of crazy household too.</v>

146
00:08:25.901 --> 00:08:30.820
So I think there are a lot of people probably like me who grew

147
00:08:30.821 --> 00:08:35.230
up in dysfunctional homes where the culture as it's gotten

148
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.270
increasingly more crazy,

149
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:41.170
I'm like that meme of the little dog drinking coffee,

150
00:08:41.171 --> 00:08:43.390
like this is fine while everything's on fire,

151
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.250
because that was what I was used to. So the culture is finally reflecting.

152
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.383
I go,

153
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:58.350
um, but I, I think, uh, the existential crisis,

154
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:02.160
the first time I had it was 19. I, you know, let's be clear,

155
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.540
I'm still an addict.

156
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:08.910
I'm a retired. Yeah, no, I still,

157
00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:12.780
that's still there. I can do anything. Addictively even if it's good for me.

158
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.610
And I have, I do have like a, a crazy, you know,

159
00:09:17.611 --> 00:09:20.880
I get fixated on things and obsessed with them.

160
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.170
Twitter is a great example. I have a hard time. People are always like,

161
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.410
how do I get on Twitter? What do I do? I don't know what to tell them,

162
00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:32.160
because I love Twitter. I was like, I need to put myself away.

163
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:35.940
So I take some breaks too. I do. And I have,

164
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.300
I have a pretty healthy relationship to social media for the most part,

165
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.550
but I think it's about to get healthier. We're going to talk about my,

166
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.473
my,

167
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:50.190
I think what being in recovery has done for me during all of this

168
00:09:50.191 --> 00:09:52.080
craziness and I have,

169
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.430
I just celebrated six years of sobriety in October. Um,

170
00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:58.613
it,

171
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:04.350
I can't personally be an anger or resentment because it

172
00:10:04.351 --> 00:10:09.330
puts my sobriety in danger. So I can't live with that stuff.

173
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.590
So I quickly have to figure out how to come into acceptance.

174
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.270
