00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.160
<v 0>There was a guy who actually sells a couple of weeks ago,</v>

2
00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:05.490
who on Twitter was telling me, Oh yeah, I work for the firm that, you know,

3
00:00:05.491 --> 00:00:08.520
moms demand, hires whenever they have events.

4
00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:10.440
And I've had moms demand in every town,

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.660
confirmed this to me separately from this,

6
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.320
but you're hiring private security for you,

7
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:18.780
but you don't want other individuals to have that access.

8
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.620
I don't want to outsource the caring of my firearm.

9
00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:24.360
And that seems really classist.

10
00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:27.090
If we're to have a discussion about legitimate class warfare,

11
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.560
I would think the idea that only people wealthy enough to hire private security,

12
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.240
to protect them.

13
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.170
That is incredibly classes because not everybody has Bloomberg money,

14
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:38.850
not everybody is in that position.

15
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.700
<v 2>Probably loved the fact that I haven't really brought up guns with the gun</v>

16
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:56.930
lady, but let's, let's do a little bit, let's do a little bit on guns.

17
00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:59.480
I'm sure I'm not the first person to refer to you as the gun lady, right?

18
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.373
That's the gun, right?

19
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.303
<v 0>It seems like.</v>

20
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.140
<v 2>Different adjectives before gun lady.</v>

21
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.880
There's probably some other adjectives they put in.

22
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.610
<v 0>And also is interchangeable.</v>

23
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.980
<v 2>Touché touché uh, okay. So we, we actually don't have to do a ton on it.</v>

24
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.920
Cause you do so much time. You spent so much time talking about this stuff,

25
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.000
but could you,

26
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.830
could we do like two or three things that you would love to explain to

27
00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:29.600
say anti-gun people or two or three things that are like the memes that are just

28
00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:33.380
misunderstood about our laws or about the second amendment?

29
00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:35.840
Just a couple of things that we could maybe clean up,

30
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.050
because I think that you've had to spend a lot of time doing that sort of thing.

31
00:01:39.051 --> 00:01:42.260
There was that infamous CNN town hall after Parkland.

32
00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:44.630
And that was just a absolute fiasco,

33
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.110
but maybe just a couple of the things that people should know that maybe they

34
00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:49.820
don't fully grasp or.

35
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.070
<v 0>Something like that. Yeah, no, I, um, I think the,</v>

36
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.440
the biggest thing is a lot of people think that they're anti-gun,

37
00:01:57.441 --> 00:01:59.360
but they're not, they're really not.

38
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.760
They are anti you having a gun because they don't trust themselves.

39
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.730
And because they don't trust themselves and they don't have confidence in their

40
00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:11.060
ability to handle it, they project that on to other individuals.

41
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.310
I always tell people if you're anti-gun then you really don't believe in you.

42
00:02:16.311 --> 00:02:19.220
I mean, you shouldn't believe in calling the police to come with their guns.

43
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.020
If you have a need where firepower is required as a solution, uh,

44
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.810
you shouldn't hire private security if you're anti-gun.

45
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.030
And I think that the idea of, well I'm okay with guns so long as you know,

46
00:02:32.031 --> 00:02:36.870
private security has them or police have them. And there was a guy who actually,

47
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.890
this was a couple of weeks ago who on Twitter was telling me, Oh yeah,

48
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:44.240
I work for the firm that, you know, moms demand hires whenever they have events.

49
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.410
And I've had moms demand in every town, confirm this to me separately from this,

50
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.040
but you're hiring private security for you,

51
00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:54.500
but you don't want other individuals to have that access.

52
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.340
I don't want to outsource the caring of my firearm.

53
00:02:58.341 --> 00:03:00.070
And that seems really classist.

54
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:02.800
If we're to have a discussion about legitimate class warfare,

55
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.260
I would think the idea that only people wealthy enough to hire private security,

56
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.970
to protect them.

57
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.900
That is incredibly classes because not everybody has Bloomberg money,

58
00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:17.550
not everybody is in that position. And so if you're truly anti-gun,

59
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.810
then you would believe that for police and military and everything else it's,

60
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.190
it's not a little, little bit of a position. It's, that's one of the,

61
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.500
the areas that I think is either, or,

62
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.920
and there few areas where there really isn't a lot of nuance.

63
00:03:31.921 --> 00:03:36.120
I think that an abridgment of a natural right, is that I'll have a right. Uh,

64
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.000
so that would be like the, that would be the first thing.

65
00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:43.860
And the second thing is that we've always had firearms and we

66
00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:45.990
have more laws now than we ever had.

67
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.670
And we have seen only in terms of, uh,

68
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.170
youth acting out in ways where they shouldn't and accessing

69
00:03:55.171 --> 00:03:56.940
firearms. Uh,

70
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.250
I think that we are during a really serious problem in our society with younger

71
00:04:02.251 --> 00:04:04.950
people, with young males, particularly.

72
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.640
And I know you've talked about this before on your program,

73
00:04:08.641 --> 00:04:11.730
a lot of people have discussed this. Jordan Peterson has talked about this.

74
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.330
This is not getting enough attention. And I'm a boy. Um,

75
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.430
and I can see how easy it is for young men to go off the

76
00:04:20.431 --> 00:04:24.810
rails and young women can too, but there's something different with young men.

77
00:04:24.811 --> 00:04:27.120
And it's really easy for them to go off the rails sales.

78
00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:31.740
And it's almost we're in a society that is, in my opinion,

79
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.730
is hostile towards young men and all young men.

80
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.940
And then it gets it's into varying degrees of severity,

81
00:04:38.941 --> 00:04:41.010
depending on different boxes checked.

82
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.070
And they're all of them that is,

83
00:04:44.071 --> 00:04:48.990
is just making a kindling for this problem. And until we deal with that,

84
00:04:48.991 --> 00:04:50.640
we're always gonna have these problems,

85
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.550
but you're not going to solve it by punishing law,

86
00:04:53.551 --> 00:04:55.980
abiding people who are not the fuel for this. No problem.

87
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.680
And then I guess the last thing,

88
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.390
all of the laws that people keep saying that we need, we,

89
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.180
we have every single day,

90
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.520
that was the one I really want to you to hit every single. Okay.

91
00:05:07.521 --> 00:05:09.450
I see somebody propose something and they're like, Oh,

92
00:05:09.451 --> 00:05:11.790
well we should know crazy people that can buy guns. So, okay,

93
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.020
you can have someone committed or you can, you know, request,

94
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:17.940
there's a whole way to go about this,

95
00:05:17.941 --> 00:05:21.870
that preserves due process and protects innocent people.

96
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.210
The red flag law terrifies me.

97
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.340
And because it's a removal due process, red flag laws, aren't even about guns.

98
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.520
Red flag laws are a complete removal of due process.

99
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.620
Guns are a variable in this situation.

100
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.520
And when people read that is that that a firearm is a variable.

101
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.350
And when you set this precedent of completely obliterating someone's ability to

102
00:05:43.351 --> 00:05:45.090
have that protection, I should have due process,

103
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.010
you are going to be able to accuse people and convict them before a trial on any

104
00:05:50.011 --> 00:05:53.760
number of things. This isn't just about guns. Think of, think of an issue.

105
00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.910
And that to me is a terrifying beginning to

106
00:05:58.911 --> 00:05:59.900
full that's.

107
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.260
That's a terrifying concept and the fact that some are so incredibly

108
00:06:03.261 --> 00:06:06.560
lackadaisical about it, they're willing to under, to, to remove that,

109
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.430
that pin of, uh, of our Republic, just to what,

110
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:13.160
because they think they're going to cancel out second amendment. That's,

111
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.630
that's a horrible way to do it. Do you think that the,

112
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.520
the real tough part is, well, you got to explain some truth. Okay.

113
00:06:21.521 --> 00:06:22.600
So that that's tough,

114
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.920
but the left generally is much better at the bumper sticker answers.

115
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.460
And that is usually what people who aren't really thinking want to swallow.

116
00:06:30.461 --> 00:06:33.700
I mean, the easiest version of this is when I go to my local supermarket,

117
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.290
there is a sign on the outside and has a gun and it's crossed out and says,

118
00:06:38.291 --> 00:06:41.530
this is a gun-free zone. And if you're an average lefty,

119
00:06:41.531 --> 00:06:44.170
I think you walk in there and you're like, you feel good? You're like, Oh, well,

120
00:06:44.171 --> 00:06:48.250
there'll be no guns in here. That's fantastic. And of course all you have to do,

121
00:06:48.251 --> 00:06:49.300
like most things,

122
00:06:49.301 --> 00:06:52.360
unfortunately that come out of the left these days is think about it for about

123
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.220
six to eight seconds. And usually what you'll find is, Oh no,

124
00:06:57.221 --> 00:07:01.870
the bad guys, they probably don't pay attention to the stickers. Uh, but,

125
00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:05.860
but to do what you just did, there is takes a lot more time,

126
00:07:05.861 --> 00:07:06.750
takes more attention,

127
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.900
takes more work and knowledge rather than here's a sticker on the door.

128
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.870
I feel good about it to you. Yeah. Well,

129
00:07:13.871 --> 00:07:18.010
and the stickers don't create this like invisible force field like that,

130
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:22.090
that star Trek technology does not yet exist in our world or maybe it does.

131
00:07:22.091 --> 00:07:24.820
And we just don't know how to maybe that's what those UFO videos are about,

132
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.340
but we, it doesn't,

133
00:07:27.341 --> 00:07:31.180
it doesn't prevent bad guys from coming into the area. You know,

134
00:07:31.181 --> 00:07:34.780
they're not going to show up illegally in possession of a firearm.

135
00:07:34.781 --> 00:07:37.480
And I hate the phrase, illegal guns. It's always illegal possession.

136
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.970
They're not going to show up with an illegally possessed kind of go,

137
00:07:39.971 --> 00:07:42.700
you know what? I was going to go in here and do some really shady stuff,

138
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:44.080
but this sticker

139
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.720
sticker it that doesn't it. Yeah, that does. That's never happened.

140
00:07:49.721 --> 00:07:52.690
And John Lott, who is a walking encyclopedia,

141
00:07:52.691 --> 00:07:54.100
he's done a lot of research on this.

142
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.390
And I think what is it like the vast majority of mass casualty incidents,

143
00:07:58.391 --> 00:08:02.590
these mass shootings that have taken place from the period of 1953 till the

144
00:08:02.591 --> 00:08:05.800
current time have been in gun-free zones.

145
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.830
And a lot of these gun-free zones, they don't even have,

146
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.400
they don't even have armed security to protect that,

147
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.330
or at least try to protect the people that they allow to come in. So that,

148
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:20.680
that is like Linus is blanket, right? It's a safety blanket,

149
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.870
this idea of a gun-free anything.

150
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.540
Why don't you just put a sign out that says crime-free,

151
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.070
where does some crime acceptable to you?

152
00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:31.780
Just put a crime free zone sticker that this is it's never worked. We,

153
00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:35.650
we live in a reality where, and this is why I think freedom scares some freedom,

154
00:08:35.651 --> 00:08:36.310
scares people.

155
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:41.080
Some people cannot handle freedom because

156
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.710
they don't, I think trust themselves and they don't trust other people.

157
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.940
And there are going to be people that are going to abuse their freedom.

158
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:54.400
And even after they have been caught and they have faced justice and they

159
00:08:54.401 --> 00:08:55.234
have been,

160
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.880
they're still going to re-offend and they're still going to choose to do bad

161
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:02.550
things with their free will. And the, you will,

162
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:06.780
you're never going to be able to legislate evil away because you cannot

163
00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:09.630
legislate that away in each individual.

164
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.360
And the solution isn't to remove

165
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.090
people's ability to defend themselves.

166
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:23.100
The solution is to make criminals afraid with more severe penalties.

167
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.030
Instead of, I mean,

168
00:09:24.031 --> 00:09:26.460
I could sit here and talk to you about our justice system on and on and on,

169
00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:30.030
because I think we have a massive problem and we have too many felonies and you

170
00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:32.550
know, some of the non-violent, it just goes on and on.

171
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.890
But for the serious offenders,

172
00:09:34.891 --> 00:09:39.050
there need to be penalties that really are adequate deterrence and,

173
00:09:39.051 --> 00:09:40.110
and allow a quit,

174
00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:43.920
punishing the law abiding for what these people choose to freely do.

175
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.980
And I always tell people, you know, there are no such thing as loopholes.

176
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.430
It's like if someone is caught driving under the influence,

177
00:09:50.431 --> 00:09:55.200
they have their license suspended and they continue going it and

178
00:09:55.201 --> 00:09:58.560
driving a vehicle and they get caught. That's not a loophole,

179
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.660
they're breaking the law, that's a criminal act.

180
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:04.140
So these loopholes that people keep talking about there's criminal acts and

181
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.370
non-criminal acts,

182
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:09.570
there's no nuance there at the ATF has things covered to the point of being

183
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.750
overcovered. So there's, there's a criminal act.

184
00:10:12.751 --> 00:10:15.060
And then there's a non-criminal act. There's no loophole,

185
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:18.120
but we always hear about the gun show loophole.

186
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.500
I know the gun show loophole because you know, you always have gang members.

187
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:27.210
They have going out there and buying super expensive, um, collectors, guns,

188
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:30.900
and then going out and committing all of these crimes with collectors items.

189
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:34.320
And even that is even, even private sales are regulated to a point.

190
00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:39.300
And the penalty on that is incredibly high. Um, but that's not how, I mean,

191
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.710
gangbangers, they've done surveys on this.

192
00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.590
There are people who are committing crimes or getting this off the black market.

193
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.470
And if you think you're going to eradicate the black market, I mean,

194
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:47.910
look how well the war on drugs has gone.

195
00:10:47.911 --> 00:10:50.400
You think that this is going to be any different? I mean, it's the same thing,

196
00:10:50.401 --> 00:10:51.240
different variable.

197
00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.290
