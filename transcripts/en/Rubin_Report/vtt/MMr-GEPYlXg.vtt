00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.390
<v 0>Listen, I have my younger son. Who's younger than my daughter. Uh,</v>

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.540
once came up to me and I did a sad truth clip on it on my channel,

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.020
where he saw something. I can't remember the exact details,

4
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:14.220
but it was something like the future is female, male toxicity,

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.270
toxic masculinity.

6
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.930
And he was sitting with me watching and he kind of looked at me and I don't

7
00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:19.860
remember his exact words,

8
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:23.130
but he said something like daddy are our boys really bad.

9
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.320
It was really with the innocence of a young child.

10
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.060
And imagine that you are in calculating to half the world's

11
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:35.040
population known as boys, this kind of pathological stage,

12
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.330
right? You're pathologizing masculinity. It's grotesque. We could,

13
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.200
we could be feminists in the truest sense of the term and the Christina Huff

14
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:47.640
summer sense of the word without being pathologizing,

15
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.080
half of the world called boys.

16
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:56.743
<v 1>What do you think.</v>

17
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.410
<v 2>We'll take truly to get us past this, that,</v>

18
00:00:59.411 --> 00:01:03.760
that seems to be the next step of this conversation. Okay. We,

19
00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:06.680
we talked about it for a while. We understand it.

20
00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:09.380
Now the masses see a problem, but,

21
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.440
but what is the thing beyond just the courage part? I mean, what,

22
00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:17.390
what would be a societal way to actually put some of this stuff behind us?

23
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.580
<v 0>So certainly having sort of a cataclysmic, you know,</v>

24
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.220
Savior's Trump come along,

25
00:01:25.221 --> 00:01:28.610
but the reality is Trump is only is going to be out either in a few months or in

26
00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:29.390
a few years.

27
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.410
So you can't just rely on Trump because he ended critical race theory.

28
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.320
Then the problem that idea pathogens is going to go away forever,

29
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.520
but you certainly need.

30
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.740
<v 2>My dad. I, I thought he's never,</v>

31
00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:42.680
I thought he's never going to step down and he's going to be president until 20,

32
00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:44.900
64 or something I could have. I thought.

33
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.180
<v 0>Exactly. Uh, so,</v>

34
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.740
so certainly having someone who was able to come from the outside and

35
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.540
redress, many of these things is great, but I truly think it's a long game.

36
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.040
You know, war there has to be involvement.

37
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.330
So I'll give you an example. My, my, uh, one of my children, her,

38
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.710
her science teacher has a BLM sign as an avatar.

39
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.400
So I could do one of two things at that point. I could say, well, forget it.

40
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.360
Or I could write politely, right? Without being too bombastic,

41
00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:21.350
without engaging in all sorts of gathering items, you know, cutting satire,

42
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.540
I could write to her politely and say, you know,

43
00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:28.340
is it appropriate for a science teacher who is educating my young child to

44
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.700
espouse a particular position? What if we don't agree with this position? Right?

45
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.420
So I can, at that point, I have a bifurcation.

46
00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:39.200
I can either get involved or not get involved that has to happen

47
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.000
300 million times a day in every interaction. And every exchange,

48
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.020
if that happens, the wall of will collapse quickly.

49
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.800
If it doesn't, it will be a long drawn out needless war.

50
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.180
So this is why I implore people get engaged. Your voice matters.

51
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.430
It's not only up for D two Dave Rubin to the course of culture.

52
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.320
Each of you is important.

53
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.660
<v 2>So obviously I have to ask you, did you ask the teacher to do anything?</v>

54
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.120
I know you, I know we all pick our spots. We pick our fights.

55
00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:09.954
What what'd you do?

56
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.500
<v 0>I haven't, I haven't yet because you know,</v>

57
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.170
my wife was worried that I might engage in some sort of cutting positions

58
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.630
that might not be modulated well enough.

59
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.760
And that might cause sort of a retribution about that.

60
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.220
So in that particular case, I've yet to do it,

61
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.000
but I can tell you that my daughter has often come up to me and said, daddy,

62
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.320
the BLM is still up.

63
00:03:31.321 --> 00:03:35.880
So I think she's kind of almost egging me to get involved and in a sense,

64
00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:40.560
look by my children being around me and seeing the positions that I take.

65
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.140
That's one of the ways by which I fight, right?

66
00:03:43.141 --> 00:03:45.960
So if I do that and you do that with your children, he does that with this,

67
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.480
by the way, the, the,

68
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.410
the cretins are always trying to introduce the idea pathogens ever saw

69
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.010
earlier. So it starts with the universities. Then we go to the high schools.

70
00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.510
Then we go to the elementary is because the best time to reach a mind to make it

71
00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:04.590
as malleable as you can is when it doesn't have the cognitive defenses to

72
00:04:04.591 --> 00:04:07.170
protect itself against the idea of pathogens. But by the way,

73
00:04:07.171 --> 00:04:09.480
she's the one who made the joke yesterday.

74
00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:12.930
She was eating something during Kapoor. And she said, well, don't worry, daddy.

75
00:04:12.931 --> 00:04:16.320
I self identify as, as right.

76
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.090
So this little child who has heard my satire was able to construct

77
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.800
that satirical moment.

78
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.650
<v 2>I, I was told a story by a friend of mine who has a five-year-old that in,</v>

79
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.270
you know, the school year just started.

80
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.710
And that one of the parents sent around a note, uh, to the,

81
00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:39.450
to the other parents in the class that the boy biological boy,

82
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.310
uh, he's a boy at home, but wants to be a girl at school. And they,

83
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.720
so they want everyone to refer to him as whatever the girl name is the female

84
00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:53.190
name at school, but then he goes home and he's a boy again and again,

85
00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:57.150
without this is not mocking trans people or anything like that,

86
00:04:57.151 --> 00:05:02.130
but it's sort of the way it all spills over so that that everyone else has to

87
00:05:02.131 --> 00:05:04.410
behave the way you want them to behave.

88
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.140
But also could this possibly have come from the five-year-old.

89
00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:09.750
I want to be a girl at school, but a boy at home. Like,

90
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.970
it doesn't really sound like that.

91
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.200
<v 0>And, and listen, I have my younger son who's younger than my daughter, uh,</v>

92
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.600
once came up to me and I did a sad truth clip on it,

93
00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:22.830
on my channel where he saw something. I can't remember the exact details,

94
00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:27.030
but it was something like the future is female, male toxicity,

95
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.080
toxic masculinity.

96
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.740
And he was sitting with me watching and he kind of looked at me and I don't

97
00:05:31.741 --> 00:05:33.420
remember his exact words, but he said something like,

98
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.940
daddy are our boys really bad.

99
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.130
It was really with the innocence of a young child.

100
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.870
And imagine that you are in calculating to half the world's

101
00:05:42.871 --> 00:05:47.850
population known as boys, this kind of pathological stage,

102
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.140
right? You're pathologizing masculinity. It's grotesque. We could,

103
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.010
we could be feminists in the truest sense of the term and the Christina Huff

104
00:05:56.011 --> 00:06:00.470
summer sense of the word without being pathologizing.

105
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.090
Half of the world called boys.

106
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.660
<v 2>Yeah. I know Jordan wrote a blurb.</v>

107
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.390
Jordan Peterson wrote a bur a blurb for the book. Um,

108
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.390
that's really what he was hitting on more than anything else. Right? I mean,

109
00:06:10.391 --> 00:06:12.580
he was trying to, well, I can't say more than anything else,

110
00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:16.110
but in conjunction with many other big things that,

111
00:06:16.111 --> 00:06:19.150
that you can't say to all these ways, you're inherently evil.

112
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.830
And now he's been gone for a year and a half. And I think a lot of people are,

113
00:06:22.831 --> 00:06:24.700
are lost without that.

114
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.920
<v 0>Yeah. And I, I got to say, since he is a common friend, when I wrote to Jordan,</v>

115
00:06:29.921 --> 00:06:33.550
it was for, to get him there, to get from him, the endorsement for the book.

116
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.780
It was literally at the worst possible time when he was going through all his

117
00:06:37.781 --> 00:06:40.840
stuff. And he writes right back to me and says,

118
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.890
you are literally the first person I'm responding to. You know,

119
00:06:44.891 --> 00:06:49.450
since opening my laptop, this is the kind of friendship that matters, right.

120
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.360
Jordan and I can disagree on some things. We disagree on young.

121
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.230
We disagree on it. But even if we disagree on points a and B,

122
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.720
when it comes to going into the trenches together,

123
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.200
you want to have guys who have your back and at his lowest moment,

124
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.840
he was willing to take time. So love the diet.

125
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:05.891
<v 2>Dad,</v>

126
00:07:05.891 --> 00:07:09.790
are you telling me that academic people could have different beliefs come to

127
00:07:09.791 --> 00:07:14.440
different conclusions and not try to get each other fired or kicked out of the

128
00:07:14.441 --> 00:07:16.900
university or out of all the social clubs?

129
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.090
<v 0>Incredible. Isn't it? Who knew.</v>

130
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:24.280
<v 2>It's, it's just bizarre. Uh, what else can the, can the average person do?</v>

131
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.460
I mean, that, that to me is where this all comes together.

132
00:07:27.461 --> 00:07:28.840
The average guy you're at, I mean,

133
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.110
because of what it always comes down to also is the person going forget the

134
00:07:32.111 --> 00:07:34.240
tenured part that you talked about it, whatever.

135
00:07:34.241 --> 00:07:36.670
And that certain people's makeup isn't to be combative,

136
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.350
but just the person who's going, you know, I'm, I'm just at whatever my job is,

137
00:07:41.351 --> 00:07:44.290
you know, I'm a decent, hardworking person. I've got kids,

138
00:07:44.291 --> 00:07:46.600
I've got all these other responsibilities. And for me to,

139
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.590
to do that little jump, even though I think most people agree with you,

140
00:07:50.591 --> 00:07:52.150
most people heard what you said, and they go, well,

141
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.310
if 300 million people all did at once,

142
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.660
we really could change something overnight. Um, but in their own life,

143
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.690
they just can't do it. Are there any other tricks? Cause this,

144
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.070
this is a question I get all the time.

145
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.160
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so in chapter eight, the last chapter,</v>

146
00:08:06.161 --> 00:08:09.760
I do have a set of prescriptions. I, the chapter is called call to action.

147
00:08:09.761 --> 00:08:13.600
So I'll give you a few. One of them does address the fact that you said, Oh,

148
00:08:13.601 --> 00:08:14.770
some of them are not combative.

149
00:08:14.771 --> 00:08:19.390
The reality is you can't have your values and principles murdered and raped

150
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.110
without ever being combative. If,

151
00:08:21.111 --> 00:08:25.950
if I'm walking down the street with my wife and three guys come to re gang rape

152
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:30.730
her, I can't say, sorry, sorry, sweetie. I'm not combative. So good luck. Right?

153
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.830
So I have two.

154
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.700
And then one of the prescriptions I have is activate your inner Honeybadger.

155
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:41.140
Now, the reason why, again, I use this animal comparison because Honeybadger is,

156
00:08:41.141 --> 00:08:45.670
don't give an F right, honey badgers. You can have a, a,

157
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.390
a pride of lions, six lines. You could go on on YouTube and see those clips.

158
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.980
You can have six lines approach. A honey Honeybadger is the size of Emma.

159
00:08:53.981 --> 00:08:56.460
May she rest in peace, a small, a small dog.

160
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.230
And the response will be so ferocious that the six,

161
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.750
six lines will look at each other and go, what the hell?

162
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:05.010
I don't want part of this. Right?

163
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:09.060
So you can't really fight in a war in this case,

164
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:13.830
a war of ideas without ever triggering your EIR without ever being indignant.

165
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:16.620
So you can't be passive. You can't be castrated.

166
00:09:16.621 --> 00:09:19.860
So unfortunately you have to at once, once in a while be kebabs.

167
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:21.360
So activate your inner honeybees.

168
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.100
