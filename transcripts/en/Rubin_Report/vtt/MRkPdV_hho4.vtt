1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.010
<v 0>It's the same guys that you don't have for years. I mean,</v>

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.840
obviously I'm such a big gun guy, right?

3
00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:07.260
So the same guys that for years told me, why do you need an AR 15?

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.860
There's no background check. It's ridiculous. You know, Don, what AR 15,

5
00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:14.400
should I buy, um, John? Oh my God, there's a waiting period. What's going on?

6
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:16.350
I want a gun there's stuff going on in my neighborhood. I mean,

7
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.290
I go for 10 years, you told me that these things didn't exist.

8
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.170
Cause you had no idea, but that was the talking point. You know,

9
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.230
I think they're waking up to how ridiculous it's become.

10
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.140
<v 1>Do you miss the good liberals? Because we talked about this last time,</v>

11
00:00:36.141 --> 00:00:41.000
but you're a new Yorker. You grew up mostly around liberals. Uh,

12
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.720
I know you have a lot of friends that are still liberals. Like,

13
00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:47.510
do you miss that, that New York liberal,

14
00:00:47.511 --> 00:00:49.820
that was not sort of the bananas left?

15
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.330
<v 0>I do. And it's sort of interesting. I mean,</v>

16
00:00:53.331 --> 00:00:55.790
some of them are still that way and honestly, some of them are just like,

17
00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:57.230
I can't believe what's going on. I'm like,

18
00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.960
you know the same guys that you don't have for years. I mean,

19
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.790
obviously I'm such a big gun guy, right?

20
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:05.210
So the same guys that for years told me, why do you need an AR 15?

21
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.810
There's no background check. It's ridiculous. You know, Don, what AR 15,

22
00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:12.350
should I buy John? Oh my God, there's a waiting period. What's going on?

23
00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:14.330
I want a gun there's stuff going on in my neighborhood. I mean,

24
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.240
I go for 10 years, you told me that these things didn't exist.

25
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.150
Cause you had no idea, but that was the talking point. You know,

26
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.840
I think they're waking up to how ridiculous it's become. So, you know,

27
00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:26.600
it's been a little bit cathartic for me because you know, those radicals that,

28
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.910
you know, just, you literally, you know,

29
00:01:27.911 --> 00:01:30.320
I used to be able to put myself in their shoes, argue their point.

30
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.870
It's not like I stick to a a hundred percent conservative dogma.

31
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.380
You know that in the conversations we've had way before we even got into

32
00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:38.930
politics. I'm pretty open about that. And yet, you know,

33
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.090
I used to be able to argue those points.

34
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.720
I can't argue the mainstream Democrat platform anymore with a straight face and

35
00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:48.400
be like, this is, this is somehow good for America. Most of them can't and,

36
00:01:48.401 --> 00:01:52.100
and that's the problem. They see it. So there's plenty of those Democrats.

37
00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:53.930
I know a bunch that are just like, yeah, you know,

38
00:01:53.931 --> 00:01:56.840
we don't love every aspect of what you're doing, but like w we believe in gummy,

39
00:01:56.841 --> 00:01:59.270
we believe in freedom. We believe in freedom of speech. We believe in,

40
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.700
and you're listing these things that, you know,

41
00:02:01.701 --> 00:02:03.440
I said it in my convention speech, like, you know,

42
00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:06.980
freedom of speech and thought that used to be a liberal value, you know,

43
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.980
try wearing, you know, tolerance used to be a liberal value. I mean,

44
00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:12.080
they still run around. They're the party of tolerance. I'm saying,

45
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.950
try wearing a Maga hat in Portland, you know,

46
00:02:15.951 --> 00:02:18.170
try wearing a Maga hat and one of these major cities. Now,

47
00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:21.440
if you wore a Biden hat and I haven't seen any of them,

48
00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:26.180
but if someone made one and water's gotta be one somewhere where it,

49
00:02:26.181 --> 00:02:28.880
in the most, you know, I don't want to call it Maga country.

50
00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:32.150
That's a Jessie Smollett special. But like, uh, you know, in,

51
00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:35.000
in the most conservative, no one's gonna, they won't even say anything to you.

52
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:37.670
They won't, they won't spit at you. They won't throw you,

53
00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:39.350
they won't beat you over the head with a brick.

54
00:02:39.351 --> 00:02:42.170
Like you're seeing in these videos, you know, they won't lose your store,

55
00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:43.130
cancel your business,

56
00:02:43.131 --> 00:02:47.660
or you'll get petitions going to ruin your life on Facebook. They won't do that,

57
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.900
but try doing it the other way. So, you know, the party of tolerance,

58
00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:54.290
isn't so tolerant. And I think a lot of reasonable Democrats, you know, uh,

59
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.990
get that. I also think a lot of, sort of that, that history,

60
00:02:56.991 --> 00:03:00.940
that blue collar working class union in the headache tradition of voting that

61
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:03.580
way, I think they get it too. They're saying, what is, you know,

62
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.590
I used to hear it at 16. Well, you know, no one,

63
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.900
if my grandfather knew that I was voting for a Republican,

64
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:10.000
he'd be rolling over in his grave. I go, well,

65
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:13.480
what would he say about today's Democrat platform? Not that one. And he goes,

66
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.960
huh. You know, you're, you're right. Done. Like, Oh my God, I go,

67
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:21.760
how many genders are there? 96 or two, what would he say? You know, John F.

68
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.450
Kennedy, you know, this pillar of the Democrat party, he'd be all right today,

69
00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:29.920
Dave, he'd be canceled. Right. He'd be tuned and canceled. And it would be over.

70
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:34.480
I mean, uh, it's just not your grandfather's Democrat party anymore.

71
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:36.940
And I think that has ostracized, you know,

72
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.210
so many former Democrats where they're starting to become, you know,

73
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.230
either somewhat conservative, uh, moderates or, or really, you know,

74
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:47.320
sort of libertarian in many of their views, which are so many of my views too.

75
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.510
<v 1>Yeah. I, I hear you, man. And we've had many discussions about it. Let's,</v>

76
00:03:51.511 --> 00:03:54.780
let's jump to a private discussion we had about it. Cause I think it'll,

77
00:03:54.781 --> 00:03:57.960
it'll get to something really interesting here, which is, uh, my,

78
00:03:57.961 --> 00:04:00.890
my audience has heard it, but one night, uh, you,

79
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.350
you and Kimberly invited David and I to dinner at Mar-a-Lago.

80
00:04:04.351 --> 00:04:09.300
We had a really nice dinner. We argued about politics for two, three hours. Uh,

81
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.930
I had a couple drinks. You do not drink. So I'm not sure who won the arguments,

82
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.840
but we did about three hours there. And then at the end, you,

83
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.310
your dad was there. And by the way,

84
00:04:17.311 --> 00:04:20.010
this was right at the beginning of impeachment. And everybody said,

85
00:04:20.011 --> 00:04:23.280
the walls were closing in. He's freaking out the guy sitting there,

86
00:04:23.281 --> 00:04:24.270
he has no tie on.

87
00:04:24.271 --> 00:04:27.390
He was with Giuliani and people and he's laughing and having fun. Anyway,

88
00:04:27.391 --> 00:04:29.460
at the end of dinner, you said, Hey, would you like to meet my dad?

89
00:04:29.461 --> 00:04:32.760
And I was like, uh, yeah, I'd like to meet the president. Let's let's do it.

90
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.470
And you introduce us. And then he turns to David and he says, well, who are you?

91
00:04:37.471 --> 00:04:41.370
And David says, well, I'm his husband and your dad immediately. Like,

92
00:04:41.371 --> 00:04:44.580
there was no pause. He clapped his hands together. He slapped him on the table.

93
00:04:44.581 --> 00:04:46.650
He said, that's great. That's just great.

94
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.770
I want to stand up and shake your hands. He shakes our hands. He says,

95
00:04:49.771 --> 00:04:52.830
the only thing wrong with you guys is you're too handsome. Melania,

96
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.260
can you believe it? These handsome guys are married.

97
00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.090
And it was just so obvious to me that in this completely unscripted,

98
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.380
unplanned moment where you just brought us up to him, that he,

99
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.810
he actually said, I don't know if he wants me to say it,

100
00:05:06.811 --> 00:05:09.690
but I've said it before. He said, I want you guys to know something.

101
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.290
I don't give a. And I don't think anyone's given a in,

102
00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:17.370
in 20 years talking about, about gay marriage or whatever. Um,

103
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.230
how do you get over the labels when it comes to something like that?

104
00:05:22.231 --> 00:05:24.270
Just the base stuff your dad is,

105
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.070
or your family is homophobic or they're racist because no matter how many

106
00:05:29.071 --> 00:05:33.330
times I tell that story, people say I'm a sell out somehow or so. You know,

107
00:05:33.331 --> 00:05:34.890
some version of some of that stuff.

108
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.170
<v 0>That, well, the reality is this,</v>

109
00:05:37.171 --> 00:05:41.700
Donald Trump is the first person to run for president of the United States.

110
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.570
That when he ran, he was for gay marriage. I mean,

111
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.480
Obama was against it because he was told he had to be against it.

112
00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:51.720
And maybe he wasn't in his actual convictions, but as part of his platform,

113
00:05:51.721 --> 00:05:55.050
he was against it because that's what they had to do. Right.

114
00:05:55.051 --> 00:05:58.670
That's you listen to the talking points and you must to them. So, you know,

115
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.340
again, Donald, Trump's been way ahead of that curve.

116
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:03.140
I think we have we've we're from New York. I mean,

117
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:07.010
it's like a pretty big percentage of the people around us at any given time are

118
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:11.030
probably, we just don't care what you do in your own. You know, who gives a?

119
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.360
No one, no one's going to care. It's one of those issues. You're right. I mean,

120
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.830
we're already there, frankly,

121
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:19.820
but it's one of yours it'll be even even different. Right. Even more so, I mean,

122
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.270
even some of the older school people that, you know, may be a little bit more,

123
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.350
you know, just to kinda read the, sort of the older religious dogma on it.

124
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.980
Like no one cares. Even the people that say they care, no, they don't care.

125
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:32.360
They sort of, they feel obligated to do it.

126
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:34.430
Donald Trump just had the guts to be like, Hey, I don't care.

127
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:36.290
I'm running for the Republican nomination.

128
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:38.840
And this is not an issue for me whatsoever. Go ahead. Have at it.

129
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.740
I always joke that the best wedding I ever went to was a gay wedding because it

130
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:45.410
was on a Tuesday. They were like, well, we don't want to screw up your weekend.

131
00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:47.300
We're just gonna have fun on a Tuesday. I think that's perfect.

132
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.930
This is the greatest wedding ever. I don't have to lose my whole weekend.

133
00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:55.040
That's awesome. I love you guys. Um, and so, you know, he has a kid, but again,

134
00:06:55.041 --> 00:06:57.500
you see it every day. Donald Trump has been so bad.

135
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.270
I think you guys didn't have a problem with Obama,

136
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.290
literally running against gay marriage in 2008,

137
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.310
but Donald Trump runs as a, as a conservative,

138
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.600
you literally going against the, you know, the more traditional dog. Again,

139
00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:13.850
I don't think it's a party platform issue at this point. I don't it,

140
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:16.040
like I said, I don't think anyone cares. So they probably haven't for a while,

141
00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:19.700
but he literally said, I don't care. Well, you know, guess what? You know,

142
00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:20.570
you're a Republican,

143
00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:22.850
you're trying to get the evangelical vote and you still say, Hey,

144
00:07:22.851 --> 00:07:26.060
I don't care about that. Let people live and let live. I mean,

145
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.330
the Republican party is the true party of tolerance.

146
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.330
Now that doesn't mean I've been open about this too.

147
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:34.400
And it doesn't mean I don't draw the line. Some places again,

148
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.420
I don't care how you even identify, where I start to care is when you know,

149
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.880
you're six, two, two 85 and Jack,

150
00:07:40.881 --> 00:07:43.010
and you decide you want to be a woman and compete against, you know,

151
00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:45.890
my daughter is sports. You know, I,

152
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:49.940
I don't identify how you want, but you start taking her scholarship.

153
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.901
I have a problem.

154
00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:54.080
I wonder where the people who fought for title nine are how come they won't say

155
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:56.360
anything. But it's interesting when I've come out on some of those things.

156
00:07:56.361 --> 00:07:57.890
And again, I don't give a crap if you're trans or not,

157
00:07:57.891 --> 00:08:00.320
that makes no difference to me. It's when you sort of let's,

158
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.740
let's have the best, let's take a female athlete. Who's top of her game.

159
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:06.430
Who's worked her whole life. I'm a journeyman male athlete.

160
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.600
That's not working out so well, congratulations. I'm going to flip it.

161
00:08:08.601 --> 00:08:10.550
Now I'm a state champion. I'm getting your scholarship.

162
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.420
I have a problem with that. And I've said it I've been very vocal about it.

163
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.630
I've even put it out on Twitter.

164
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.720
And it's interesting because if I put out anything on Twitter, you know,

165
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.380
before someone could have even read, you know, read my tweet,

166
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.960
they're up there with the hate mail and the hate commentary.

167
00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:26.930
But when I do that one, it's sort of interesting. I get this note like,

168
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:33.290
ah, man, God did it, but I hate him, but I'm with Don Jr. On this one.

169
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.150
