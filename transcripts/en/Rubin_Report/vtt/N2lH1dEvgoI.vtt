00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.050
<v 0>What I am doing.</v>

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.190
And what I do on a professional basis every day is I take the meme culture

3
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:08.340
world. The meme world, prequel meme, star Wars means, I mean,

4
00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:10.080
some of the best memes out there, star Wars memes,

5
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.390
and you apply that to politics.

6
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.370
And you were able to get an intersectional point where you can get a young

7
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:20.370
kid or some young person who might know star Wars,

8
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:22.620
but doesn't quite understand what's going on with a beach man.

9
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.720
And you can frame it the world for them based on star Wars,

10
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.550
actually bring them into the political process, which is very important.

11
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.230
I'm Dave Rubin and according to the Wikipedia editors,

12
00:00:36.231 --> 00:00:39.650

joining me today is the chief creative officer for turning point USA

16
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.810
and me maker. Extraordinary Eddie Johnson. Fantastic.

17
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.450
This feels very overdue, man. I don't know.

18
00:00:56.451 --> 00:01:00.470
How has this taken so long to happen? You're a busy guy. You're a busy guy.

19
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.700
You're a busy guy going around the world. Jordan Peterson. It's like a,

20
00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:07.580
you know, like cut his IQ in half. You got me. Yeah.

21
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.350
You're half of Peterson's brain. Let's vary room, temperature, IQ room,

22
00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:16.280
temperature room temperature. Well, I have one of you on for a while.

23
00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:18.380
I'm glad we're finally doing this. And before, you know,

24
00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:20.890
normally when I started interview, I kind of asked people, their background,

25
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.840
a little loop framing of the interview, but I thought first,

26
00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:27.080
what we're going to do is we're just going to throw to this video that you just

27
00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:30.680
put up on Instagram. This is you going to,

28
00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:32.600
this is outside of the impeachment hearings. Yes.

29
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.520
Outside of the impeachment hearings.

30
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.620
You're asking questions about politics and Trump and impeachment all

31
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:42.800
through the lens of a little movie called star Wars.

32
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.023
<v 1>Here we go.</v>

33
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.733
<v 0>Hey everyone.</v>

34
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.510
Benny Johnson here at the United States Capitol where the impeachment trial of

35
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:52.010
president Trump is ongoing.

36
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.270
The Capitol has tens of leftist protestors gathered at it.

37
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.870
Calling for the impeachment of president Trump. Specifically,

38
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:04.460
we're asking them if star Wars references about president Trump are

39
00:02:04.461 --> 00:02:06.260
worthy of having him be impeached.

40
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.510
<v 1>Um, Senate.</v>

41
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.010
<v 0>We're going to see if these leftist protesters believe that the president should</v>

42
00:02:13.011 --> 00:02:17.480
be impeached. For instance, of killing a fictional general, general grievance.

43
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.793
<v 1>Hello?</v>

44
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.850
<v 0>I can't wait to hear what they have to say. Let's go for it.</v>

45
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.380
<v 1>Many people felt a disturbance in the forest when general grievance was killed.</v>

46
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.850
<v 0>What do you think about the killing of general grievous and why? You know,</v>

47
00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:45.500
was it right or wrong? Okay. Uh, nobody was saying that, uh,

48
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.670
he was a good person.

49
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.600
There've been a lot of bad people in, uh, in a world. Uh, and, uh,

50
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.010
uh, we have laws, everything. What we'll do.

51
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.870
<v 2>Is our mail that they shouldn't be.</v>

52
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.100
<v 1>Then July. I love them up here.</v>

53
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.710
<v 2>With new XYZ technology though. There's no,</v>

54
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.710
there's no telling what we can accomplish. I mean, you can get anyone anywhere.

55
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.570
Yes, yes, absolutely.

56
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.330
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

57
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.540
<v 2>Uh, do you think that it was right or not right to kill general grievous.</v>

58
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.930
<v 1>There's clearly an assassination. I don't think so.</v>

59
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.090
<v 2>People were saying that a thermal detonator was used for the assassination and</v>

60
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.580
these are very dangerous weapons. Do you have anything to say on that?

61
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.070
You seem to care a lot about this.

62
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.380
<v 1>Technically I can't tell you.</v>

63
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.020
I'm not sure about that yet.

64
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.180
[inaudible].

65
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.980
<v 2>This is just like the kind of music that was</v>

66
00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:01.290
being sang at MOS. Eisley Cantina.

67
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.533
<v 1>It's beautiful.</v>

68
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.890
<v 2>Uh, general grievous was killed by the administration by Trump.</v>

69
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.210
They were saying that was illegal. Do you,

70
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.160
do you believe in those kinds of killings or do you not? We have a rule of law.

71
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.930
If that rule of law says, if I think you're a bad guy,

72
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.260
then I should be able to kill you. Right? That's not our rule of law.

73
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.060
<v 1>I killed them. I killed them off.</v>

74
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.520
<v 2>The rule of laws. If I think you're a bad guy,</v>

75
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.810
I'm supposed to take you to trial and prove that you are a bad guy.

76
00:04:36.811 --> 00:04:39.540
That is our rule of law in the United States of America.

77
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.570
<v 1>You can't, he must have.</v>

78
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.120
<v 2>And trial. Apparently he was killed with a thermal detonator.</v>

79
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.860
This is like a lot concerning to a lot of people. And, uh,

80
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.180
the rule of law either we have it and we need to live by it,

81
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.030
both the citizens and our government, or we don't.

82
00:04:57.031 --> 00:04:59.010
And we don't give a crap one way or the other.

83
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.590
<v 1>My Lord is done.</v>

84
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.730
<v 0>All right. So that's just a small portion of this video that you put out there.</v>

85
00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:12.240
And I think now my audience understands why I wanted to throw that before we do

86
00:05:12.241 --> 00:05:15.570
anything else here. Now that one gentleman at the end did make a good point.

87
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.980
Should we not have taken general grievance in and put him on trial? I mean,

88
00:05:19.981 --> 00:05:21.600
he was the leader of the separatist army.

89
00:05:21.601 --> 00:05:26.520
He had just taken over from count dude, count dugu who's a horrible human being.

90
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.390
It's a good point. Yeah. I mean, it's true. I, I,

91
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.470
who knows. I mean, if it was the Obama administration,

92
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.540
definitely would have taken him out with a drone would have never seen it

93
00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:37.680
happening. You know,

94
00:05:37.681 --> 00:05:40.200
it could have even been an American citizen would have been boom,

95
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.140
Gerald Green was gone when you do these videos.

96
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.090
Cause I know most people watching them are going, Oh, come on.

97
00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:49.980
He must've had to go to a thousand different people to get the five, 10 guys.

98
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.760
First five people, not a single, I kept asking him about general grievous.

99
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.010
And you can see in the video, I keep like pushing him.

100
00:05:56.011 --> 00:05:58.100
Like people felt a disturbance in the force.

101
00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.790
<v 2>It's,</v>

102
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.380
it's very much a dark side to have this technology with a thermal detonator and

103
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.040
XYZ technology to kill this general. No one, nothing.

104
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.810
I even say later in the video that Trump should just execute an order,

105
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:13.610
66 and dissolve the Senate.

106
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.330
And then he can just get rid of this impeachment fiasco.

107
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.890
<v 0>What does this tell you about these people before we get to the star Wars</v>

108
00:06:20.891 --> 00:06:24.350
element of it and why star Wars memes really do work well?

109
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:25.360
What does this tell you about?

110
00:06:25.361 --> 00:06:28.390
A lot of the activists that are out there and people that are, you know,

111
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.460
purporting to know everything about politics.

112
00:06:30.461 --> 00:06:32.410
I'm not even talking about these five people specifically with them,

113
00:06:32.411 --> 00:06:35.230
but these people that are just out there protesting all the time and then

114
00:06:35.231 --> 00:06:37.960
whenever you see them challenge, you know, Crowder is really good at this.

115
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.600
They just suddenly no, no nothing. Yeah.

116
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.430
<v 2>Okay. So the purpose of the video,</v>

117
00:06:42.431 --> 00:06:44.470
like this is never to actually make fun of anyone.

118
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.240
What I'm trying to do is to show that there is a bankruptcy when it comes to the

119
00:06:49.241 --> 00:06:51.700
understanding of why we are impeaching this president,

120
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.690
why do are these people actually out there protesting every person in the video

121
00:06:55.691 --> 00:06:57.940
is protesting for Trump's impeachment yet,

122
00:06:57.941 --> 00:07:01.600
even when asked if they should impeach Trump for killing general grievous,

123
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:02.741
which was my question,

124
00:07:02.741 --> 00:07:07.630
should we impeach Trump for killing a fictional star Wars villain? They said,

125
00:07:07.631 --> 00:07:08.464
yeah.

126
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:13.420
And so what I am doing and what I do on a professional basis every day is I take

127
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.560
the meme culture world, the meme world, prequel meme, star Wars means, I mean,

128
00:07:17.561 --> 00:07:19.300
some of the best memes out there star Wars means,

129
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.730
and you apply that to politics and you were able to get an intersectional

130
00:07:24.731 --> 00:07:29.320
point where you can get a young kid or some young person who might know star

131
00:07:29.321 --> 00:07:31.840
Wars, but doesn't quite understand what's going on with a beach man.

132
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.610
And you can frame it the world for them based on star Wars and actually bring

133
00:07:36.611 --> 00:07:39.040
them into the political process, which is very important. So.

134
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.050
<v 0>What is it about star Wars?</v>

135
00:07:41.051 --> 00:07:45.160
Because I mean the hell out of star Wars probably only second to you, right?

136
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:50.320
And there's something particularly about the prequels that the memes just,

137
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.500
you know, how does a democracy die with thunderous applause?

138
00:07:53.501 --> 00:07:55.510
And I am the Senate and all of those lines,

139
00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.040
they seem so powerful right now. And it's like, what,

140
00:08:00.041 --> 00:08:03.670
what do you think it is about star Wars specifically that leads to this where

141
00:08:03.671 --> 00:08:05.770
other movies, you can mean some things from other movies,

142
00:08:05.771 --> 00:08:09.580
but not like the endless amount from star Wars that just fuels right for the

143
00:08:09.581 --> 00:08:10.540
moment all the time.

144
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.120
<v 2>Star Wars was, if you go,</v>

145
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.450
if you rewind the clock back to George Lucas,

146
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:21.190
he based the empire on Nazis and he based the rebellion on fighting

147
00:08:21.191 --> 00:08:25.330
Nazis. And so for people like us, particularly,

148
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:29.650
you were able to find these moral threads that you can pull out of the basic

149
00:08:29.651 --> 00:08:32.860
star Wars story, the evil of oppressive,

150
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:38.380
overarching brutalist government, uh, how it tries to squash hope,

151
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.520
how hope must rise in order to fight that greatest evil,

152
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.690
which is an oppressive, overarching massive,

153
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.700
usually by emergency powers government that can take over all of our lives.

154
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:55.090
And that is the, the truth that this was based on.

155
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.760
I think it hits at a human truth,

156
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:01.800
a truth that goes all the way back to our founding and much of the Renaissance.

157
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.000
Good. That comes from the idea that man is man, and man wants freedom.

158
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.540
And man has liberties that should not be corrupted and oppressed by a

159
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:10.710
government. It's funny because.

160
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.100
<v 0>Even though you're doing it in a funny way, there,</v>

161
00:09:13.101 --> 00:09:17.870
we could talk about the idea that should the jet. I have captured grievous.

162
00:09:17.871 --> 00:09:21.890
He was the leader of the separatist army, right? So he was an insurgent,

163
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.130
but should they have been allowed to just kill him as,

164
00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:28.640
as obiwan did or should they have captured him and taken him for trial?

165
00:09:28.641 --> 00:09:32.750
That actually is an interesting philosophical point that we debate all the time,

166
00:09:32.751 --> 00:09:35.420
because that's, to your point that when we killed Soleimani,

167
00:09:35.421 --> 00:09:37.400
everyone was saying, well, you can't just kill the guy.

168
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.280
You have to bring them in for a trial or the rest of it. That, I mean,

169
00:09:40.281 --> 00:09:42.160
that really all does add up to why.

170
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.030
<v 2>Yes, correct.</v>

171
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:48.350
Memes are a piece of non-corporate

172
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.700
non-establishment media

173
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.270
imagery that reflects a moment in culture and reflect something that we're all

174
00:09:56.271 --> 00:10:00.590
going through and explains it in a very simple and shareable way.

175
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.460
<v 0>Think for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics instead of</v>
