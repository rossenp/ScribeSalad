WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.230
<v 0>I'm in a journalist with a cause and I've been so active against</v>

2
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:09.060
oppression against radical Islamism against the Muslim brotherhood

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.500
and against care,

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.570
which is the council on American Islamic relations

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.270
relations that are the,

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.610
I call them terrorists in suits because these are the front of the

7
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:27.530
Muslim brotherhood and care who groomed a land groomed,

8
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.590
Rashida and many others. And by the way, in 2020,

9
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.240
we have more care has been grooming more than 120,

10
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.620
uh, Rashida Han alike.

11
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.100
<v 1>When did you move to the United States?</v>

12
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.850
<v 0>So I moved to the United States in 1993,</v>

13
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.730
as soon as I moved. Um, I started working in the media,

14
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.060
my mother as well. Um,

15
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.030
and then I started, um, doing, uh, um,

16
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.130
us media and Arabic.

17
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.290
And it's so funny because I was the youngest one. Um,

18
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.550
well, you know, voiceover American and voice of America is a federal, uh,

19
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.490
federal, uh, entity.

20
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.400
So when I applied for it,

21
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.500
there were like 400 something and I just went and I did my,

22
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.990
uh, test whatever.

23
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.880
And then a week later I was because there was only

24
00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:37.190
one opening and I got it.

25
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.630
So even I know I'm like really,

26
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.460
um, but the first day I was at the office,

27
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.670
all of them were so much older than I am.

28
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.470
And they looked at me. I was like, who is she?

29
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.850
But the first hour I went on air, everybody came and it's like,

30
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.110
now we can say welcome to VOA. And that was a wonderful,

31
00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:07.910
wonderful experience. Don't forget. I came here, I speak English. Uh,

32
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.030
so I came to the us speaking English.

33
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.410
So it wasn't that hard for me to just be there.

34
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.090
Plus I love the culture. I love this country. And, uh,

35
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.570
it's home. It's this where my heart is.

36
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.830
<v 1>But I don't understand.</v>

37
00:02:24.831 --> 00:02:28.640
I thought we were told all the time that America is an evil, racist,

38
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.050
patriarchal state that no dark skinned immigrant could come to and be treated

39
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:36.140
fairly. Especially if they come from the middle East to a place like Iraq,

40
00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:38.420
something like that. Are you telling me,

41
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.290
are you telling me that's not true? And you,

42
00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:45.140
if you'd love this country and work hard, you might be able to make it.

43
00:02:45.141 --> 00:02:46.010
Is that what you're telling me.

44
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.660
<v 0>Been here three decades? Uh,</v>

45
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.370
it was very easy for me to move somewhere and live. If I didn't like it,

46
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.260
why would I stay here if I did it? Like it it's one of the most,

47
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.950
it's one of the greatest, it's the greatest country in the world.

48
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.080
And, um, yeah.

49
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.770
<v 1>Is it shocking to you as someone that lived under what you lived under,</v>

50
00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:10.770
had to do everything that you just laid out to even get here?

51
00:03:10.771 --> 00:03:12.540
When you hear all of this endless,

52
00:03:12.541 --> 00:03:15.660
ridiculous craziness about how horrible America is,

53
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.640
is it just mind blowing to you?

54
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.410
<v 0>It provokes me that first of all,</v>

55
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.350
let's talk about Ilhan Omar, and that's, that's fine.

56
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.290
<v 1>We were going to get there. There's a lot of Johan Omar stuff here.</v>

57
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.150
<v 0>Because I truly believe that when you</v>

58
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.090
go to a new country and this country B becomes your

59
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.070
home, I mean, at least be,

60
00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.880
be grateful that you, you have,

61
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.740
you live in a country that you have the right of

62
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.780
every single American. You're no different than anybody else.

63
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.670
You have the right and you have the duties and that's how you should, uh,

64
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.560
deal with it. Yet.

65
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.560
There are immigrants from different countries. I'm not saying from or from,

66
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.270
uh, that they come here and they don't integrate with the communities.

67
00:04:18.271 --> 00:04:23.100
So they still live in small area that it's

68
00:04:23.101 --> 00:04:27.780
basically, they brought everything from their country and they're not willing to

69
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.620
participate or willing to be part of the, uh,

70
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.550
of the community. And that's what I feel that, um,

71
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.490
organizations and, and, uh, should work on,

72
00:04:40.491 --> 00:04:45.270
on these communities to build bridges, to make them feel,

73
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.550
um, integrated, um,

74
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.110
in schools and workplace and others.

75
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.130
I mean,

76
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.600
can you believe that someone who lives in for 20 years in a

77
00:04:57.601 --> 00:05:00.900
country that can't even speak the language,

78
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.083
how.

79
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.200
<v 1>You mean it's not racist to say that maybe you should speak language of the</v>

80
00:05:07.201 --> 00:05:09.330
country you live in, or at least try to.

81
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.090
<v 0>I mean, this is ridiculous racist, no,</v>

82
00:05:15.091 --> 00:05:18.870
this is, this is the country. This is the language of this country.

83
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.580
You want to be a part of, of this country,

84
00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:28.290
part of the communities you want to be, uh, uh, you want to provide,

85
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.500
uh, uh, you want to fulfill your duties. So you get your rights.

86
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.820
I mean, this is, come on. I mean, at least speak the language,

87
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.040
at least read a sign.

88
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.200
<v 1>Okay. So we can link all of this to Ilhan.</v>

89
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.880
But before we get specifically into her,

90
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.750
just tell me a little bit about what your general political philosophy is,

91
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.300
because now that you're running for Congress, obviously that's, it's,

92
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.560
it can't just be about I'm against Ilhan. Oh, we'll to that,

93
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.500
but just tell me a little bit about your own sort of political beliefs.

94
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.460
<v 0>Uh, a question that I've been asked so many times thinking that</v>

95
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.570
all immigrants and, um, they're,

96
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.790
they should be Democrats. I'm a conservative person. I have conservative,

97
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.770
uh, principles, um, since I came here. So,

98
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.590
um, being a journalist, I know exactly what these two,

99
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.070
uh, political parties are. Uh,

100
00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:33.220
so it's easy for me. I mean,

101
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.050
to be conservative and to be Republican. And that's what I've been since,

102
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.280
since I, I came here, I truly believe that, uh,

103
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.410
decency should be back in our political arena and our

104
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.300
lives. Uh, we we've lost it.

105
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.310
We've lost it. And this is, this is so bad. I mean,

106
00:06:57.311 --> 00:06:59.620
they hatred that we see now,

107
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.900
this was never the narrative in the United States. Yes,

108
00:07:04.901 --> 00:07:07.690
we disagree, but we don't hate each other.

109
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.420
I don't hate somebody because he's a Democrat.

110
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.540
Maybe I would never marry a Democrat,

111
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.930
but that's what we fighting all the time.

112
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.780
<v 1>But not as politician. Yeah.</v>

113
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.540
<v 0>Exactly. But you know what, uh,</v>

114
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.360
it's sad that you see in 2020 that hatred a,

115
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.800
that, um,

116
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:34.540
the toxic narratives coming from the far

117
00:07:34.541 --> 00:07:39.310
left, I wouldn't say coming from the Democrat in general, the,

118
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:44.080
the far left and the progressive that are trying to

119
00:07:44.081 --> 00:07:47.230
destroy this country. People don't want this,

120
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.020
this country to be a socialist country.

121
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.310
People don't want to live in Cuba.

122
00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.560
People don't want to live in Venezuela.

123
00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:01.420
People don't want to live in these countries or even Russia for this matter.

124
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:06.430
So we have people that are appraising these other

125
00:08:06.431 --> 00:08:09.440
countries. Um, I mean, if you praise it,

126
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.930
then you like it so much go be a Senator there.

127
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.780
<v 1>Right. Well, that's what I always say. Nobody ever leaves to come here.</v>

128
00:08:19.781 --> 00:08:22.430
Nobody's leaving. We're not stopping people from leaving, but they,

129
00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:26.350
they never leave. So was it seeing what was happening with the,

130
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.270
with the far left progressives and the socialist?

131
00:08:28.271 --> 00:08:31.330
Is that really what drove you to get into politics?

132
00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:34.630
Or was it specifically about Ilhan? And then we'll talk more about it.

133
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:35.920
<v 0>Well,</v>

134
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.870
being a journalist and I've been doing it for a long time and I do foreign

135
00:08:40.871 --> 00:08:42.520
affairs and, um,

136
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:47.290
I cover the whole world and covering

137
00:08:47.291 --> 00:08:51.790
Wars, uh, uh, conflict zones, human rights,

138
00:08:51.791 --> 00:08:56.730
crisis, um, terrorist attacks all over the world,

139
00:08:56.731 --> 00:08:59.970
especially in Europe. I've been there, done that.

140
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.930
I've so I know what kind of,

141
00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:08.250
of outcome would come from a narrative like, like this,

142
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:12.510
the oppression B uh, the hatred, the antisemitism,

143
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.030
and I think, uh,

144
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.660
Alon Omar made the biggest mistake of her life.

145
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.310
It was right when she, uh,

146
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.790
got elected and she didn't wait for long to bring out

147
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.080
all the ugliness.

148
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:29.990
<v 1>Yeah. Well, it was almost like day one.</v>

149
00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.970
She suddenly flipped on all of these things,

150
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.430
even though a lot of us could see it beforehand, obviously.

151
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.500
<v 0>Yeah. But, um,</v>

152
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.670
being there as a journalist and I'm, uh,

153
00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.100
I'm very active. I'm an,

154
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:47.840
a journalist with a cause and I've been so active against oppression

155
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:52.700
against radical Islamism against the Muslim brotherhood and against

156
00:09:52.701 --> 00:09:57.380
care, which is the council on American Islamic

157
00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.920
relations that are the,

158
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.260
I call them terrorists in suits because these are the front of the

159
00:10:06.261 --> 00:10:10.090
Muslim brotherhood and care who groomed a land groomed,

160
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:14.240
Rashida and many others. And by the way, in 2020,

161
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.890
we have more care has been grooming more than 120,

162
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.850
uh, Rashida L Han a lot.

163
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.660
