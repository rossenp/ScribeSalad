00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>The attack on our rights is shocking.</v>

2
00:00:01.711 --> 00:00:06.660
And it's the social consequences of this are unspeakable really. Um,

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.980
I mean, people are not going to comply. They're not compliant now.

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.650
I'm sure you know, this, in fact you've probably attended them,

5
00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:18.540
but there are speakeasies and all over in New York city popping up, uh,

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.950
where you can go to dinner and gathering more than five, more than 10,

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.870
even 30 people, you know, and, and they're drinking,

8
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:28.950
they're having dinner together. They're, they're in defiance of the law. Um, uh,

9
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.710
friends of mine in Manhattan, sit in their penthouses and,

10
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.310
and every night at, uh,

11
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.170
after nightfall people rush out into the streets with noisemakers, uh, just to,

12
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.360
just to illustrate that they believe in freedom.

13
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:52.160
<v 1>That's great.</v>

14
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.090
<v 0>Interesting to me that you use this word, uh, right.</v>

15
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.160
You've been using this repeated our right to assemble a right to such

16
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.870
a right to speak a right is not something that's contingent.

17
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.180
It's something that you actually possess.

18
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.280
It's not granted to you by the government.

19
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.650
It's something you owned by virtue of each humanity.

20
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.340
It's hard to talk about rights, uh, in these times.

21
00:01:16.341 --> 00:01:20.660
And we don't apparently have the right to our own property because the

22
00:01:20.661 --> 00:01:24.140
government can shut down our business on grounds that it's unessential. Right.

23
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.610
Uh, we probably don't have the right even to leave our

24
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.670
homes, um, that,

25
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.440
so once you take that away, I mean, they've,

26
00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:38.840
I don't want to be alarmist about this or anything,

27
00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:42.170
but look from a philosophical point of view,

28
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.240
we are living the practical reality of what comes very

29
00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:51.830
close to be in a totalitarian state right now. Um, now,

30
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.000
uh, fortunately thank you, political leaders,

31
00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.680
you're letting the grocery stores work. Fortunately, they're private, you know,

32
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.720
uh, uh, uh, thank you for letting us have pharmacies. You know, they're,

33
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.060
they're private entities too. Um,

34
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.630
so we're grateful for the little bit of private, private, private,

35
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.450
private markets that are left, but,

36
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.530
but the attack on everybody else and the attack on our rights is shocking.

37
00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:23.480
And it's the social consequences of this are unspeakable really. Um,

38
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.800
I mean, people are not going to comply. They're not compliant now.

39
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.440
I'm sure you know, this, in fact you've probably attended them,

40
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:35.330
but there are speakeasies and all over in New York city popping up, uh,

41
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.750
where did you can go to dinner and gathering more than five, more than 10,

42
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.690
even 30 people, you know, and, and they're drinking,

43
00:02:41.691 --> 00:02:45.740
they're having dinner together. They're there in defiance of the law. Um, uh,

44
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.520
friends of mine in Manhattan sit in their penthouses and,

45
00:02:48.521 --> 00:02:52.100
and every night at, uh,

46
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.020
after nightfall people rush out into the streets with noisemakers, uh, just to,

47
00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.390
just to illustrate that they believe in freedom, you know, and for God's sake,

48
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:04.240
do, are we not, do we not believe in freedom anymore?

49
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.940
The politicians presume that we're, we're, we're like pieces on a chess board.

50
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.270
They can just move around, but you know what? That's not true.

51
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.510
That is not the human mind. We are not inanimate objects.

52
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.360
We're not birds in cages. We will live free one way or the other.

53
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.080
<v 2>So what would you say? So of course I'm with you,</v>

54
00:03:22.081 --> 00:03:25.590
but what would you say to the people that would say, but all of those people,

55
00:03:25.591 --> 00:03:28.650
your friends that are going out onto the streets at night and the people that

56
00:03:28.651 --> 00:03:32.970
are getting together at speakeasies and going out more than they have to go out

57
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.610
and the rest of it and exercising their rights and freedom,

58
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.820
that those are the people who are going to keep this thing spreading,

59
00:03:38.821 --> 00:03:40.230
because people don't know what,

60
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.570
when to reign in their own personal responsibility and,

61
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:46.770
and do something so that, you know, society doesn't crumble,

62
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.880
something like that.

63
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.020
<v 0>Well, I, I, you know, at, at the, at the, at the head end of the light,</v>

64
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.900
you know, wherever you discovered this idea of human freedom,

65
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.610
there was also disease.

66
00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.360
If we didn't have very clean water, uh, the, you know, th there were, uh,

67
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.300
annual viruses that came along and killed people,

68
00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.670
and there were pandemics and so on,

69
00:04:08.671 --> 00:04:13.650
but they still somehow came to believe that human beings have the

70
00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:17.580
right to speak and associated and trade, and we work around it. And, and,

71
00:04:17.581 --> 00:04:21.240
and part of the belief in freedom is the confidence that society has the

72
00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:25.980
intelligence to deal with things like viruses that come along and the

73
00:04:25.981 --> 00:04:29.400
existence of disease does not disable, uh,

74
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.370
the whole of modernity. It just doesn't,

75
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.300
we can't think this way maternity was for time.

76
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.890
And there was this, and even back to the black death,

77
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.870
then invent venison. And, uh, in the third to 13th century, when it was,

78
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.100
there was still interest, they still kept trade going. There was, there was,

79
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.490
there was some towns would come up with the restrictions and that sort of thing.

80
00:04:53.491 --> 00:04:58.320
But, um, but the idea of violating people's rights,

81
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.800
fundamental rights to live and choose and speak,

82
00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:05.610
and everything was even thinkable 500 years ago. I mean, the,

83
00:05:05.611 --> 00:05:09.690
our response we've done here is it's, pre-modern,

84
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.100
it's medieval, it's, it's, it's 11th and 12th century style stuff,

85
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.000
except with a 21st century technology. Uh,

86
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.190
and we're not responding to the things scientifically, even, even,

87
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.750
even the slightest bit, uh, the response by the political class. And I mean,

88
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.400
from about March 15th,

89
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.710
onward was nothing short of mystical, superstitious.

90
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.790
Uh, it was a panic response. Let's just, uh,

91
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.170
let's just throw everybody in a cage of their own creation and,

92
00:05:42.171 --> 00:05:45.750
and punish anybody for coming out of it. And I, I, I just,

93
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.230
I totally forgive people who are going through these speakeasies. And may,

94
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.320
you could say that prudent, you know, they shouldn't be doing that,

95
00:05:52.321 --> 00:05:55.260
but for God's sake, people exercising their fundamental rights.

96
00:05:55.261 --> 00:05:57.860
I'd say we need more of that. Not of that right now.

97
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:59.630
<v 2>Do you think that's,</v>

98
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.370
that's partly just human nature that so many people just operate purely in fear.

99
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:05.061
So, you know,

100
00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:09.020
like a month ago when we had that two day window where suddenly everything shut

101
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:10.220
down out of nowhere, you know,

102
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:12.800
they announced the entire NBA season was canceled,

103
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.470
and then they canceled all these public events and,

104
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:19.490
and everything sort of happened at within a two day thing that there becomes

105
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:21.650
this odd rush to cancel,

106
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.240
because you don't want to be the one guy who's going against the crowd, right?

107
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:28.130
You don't want to be the one guy who says, no,

108
00:06:28.131 --> 00:06:29.690
we're not going to cancel our season.

109
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:31.700
We're not going to cancel all of our things.

110
00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:33.050
We're going to wait it out a little bit,

111
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.160
knowing that the risk that you take of being just destroyed by the media and

112
00:06:37.161 --> 00:06:41.050
everything else on the other side is probably worse than just going along with,

113
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.160
with, with the crowd, with the wave.

114
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.300
<v 0>Yeah. I understand your point.</v>

115
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.470
I have my doubts that there was any public support for this, uh,

116
00:06:50.471 --> 00:06:53.260
actually at all. Now it's entirely up to private venues,

117
00:06:53.261 --> 00:06:57.250
whether or not they want to have these gatherings or to accept the liability

118
00:06:57.251 --> 00:07:01.300
associated with NBA games or, or South by Southwest, you know,

119
00:07:01.301 --> 00:07:04.450
and that sort of thing, Southwest Southwestern chooses, uh,

120
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.900
to cancel a conference that was a governmental decision. So I'm looking at this,

121
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.100
and I'm not saying whether that was maybe South by Southwest,

122
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.590
should've canceled. You know, I don't know. I think about this a lot.

123
00:07:14.591 --> 00:07:15.760
I'm not actually sure about that.

124
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.790
Cause that's mostly all young people there who are actually not, uh,

125
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.720
in any great danger from COVID. Um, so I'm not, I'm not sure about that.

126
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.670
And it's hard to do counterfactuals here, but with this much, um, uh, Dave,

127
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.060
I know, and I think, you know, to, um,

128
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:37.180
politicians prioritizing governors, mayors, um,

129
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.200
senators and congressmen and so on and not owners of anything,

130
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.600
their main job is to get back to it again, that's it.

131
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.100
So they don't really have a financial economic stake.

132
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.280
They don't have skin in the game, apart from the desire to get voters,

133
00:07:54.281 --> 00:07:55.180
to vote for them again.

134
00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.740
And there was a sudden panic on the part of political leaders at all levels,

135
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:04.180
really, um, that if anybody died while they were in office,

136
00:08:04.181 --> 00:08:08.110
that they would somehow be, uh, uh, blamed for this, unless,

137
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.130
unless they just bludgeoned people, you know, and, and ruin people's lives.

138
00:08:12.131 --> 00:08:16.720
So they somehow believed there was less risk to steal people's property and

139
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:21.730
arrest people in their homes, uh, uh, than it was to, to, to, um,

140
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.380
to be blamed for, uh, pro public death. And, and that,

141
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.420
that gets us back to a problem, regardless,

142
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.410
discussion the role of the media here,

143
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.310
because what they're really fearing ultimately is is,

144
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.140
is this cancel culture, you know, the, the Twitter mops and, and, uh,

145
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.820
and the New York times editorial page and, and, and, and the media culture,

146
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:50.860
that's this last lost all rationality and clearly clarity there.

147
00:08:50.861 --> 00:08:55.800
They're afraid of being, um, uh, denounced and dragged through the mud and,

148
00:08:55.801 --> 00:09:00.390
and drawn and quartered and so on by the press. So I ultimately,

149
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:04.100
I feel like storm to you, doesn't that feel? Yeah.

150
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.970
<v 2>And storm of just of the end of the media that we've all been seeing.</v>

151
00:09:07.971 --> 00:09:10.790
And as you said before, you didn't even want to see it,

152
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:14.420
but that's so many of us have seen the end of mainstream media.

153
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.840
We've watched our academic and political institutions crumble,

154
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.760
and then something like this comes in and just takes the last remaining

155
00:09:22.761 --> 00:09:25.610
foundation of it, and then adds fear to it.

156
00:09:25.611 --> 00:09:29.270
And you take just fearful people who don't even understand what their rights are

157
00:09:29.271 --> 00:09:34.060
as you alluded to earlier. And then you really have, have the perfect storm to.

158
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:39.020
<v 0>To control everybody. But I like this phrase, the perfect storm,</v>

159
00:09:39.021 --> 00:09:42.440
and I think it's the best description to explain what's happened to us. Really.

160
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:47.630
It wasn't, it wasn't really a conspiracy and, uh, uh, from the top,

161
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.150
but of course, you know, there's conspiracy theories was like,

162
00:09:50.151 --> 00:09:53.630
we'll never stop them. You know, they've been generated by the day.

163
00:09:53.631 --> 00:09:55.340
And I totally forgive that.

164
00:09:55.341 --> 00:09:57.920
People want it want to understand what has happened to their freedoms.

165
00:09:57.921 --> 00:09:58.940
What's happened to their rights,

166
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:02.900
but why did the world go dark suddenly then people assume there's some central

167
00:10:02.901 --> 00:10:04.940
plan. I don't believe that actually.

168
00:10:04.941 --> 00:10:06.680
I think it was just this combination of fact.

169
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.970
And I I've been wanting to kind of write about this for a while, but yeah,

170
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.560
it is a perfect storm. It was, uh, uh, Holly media, panic politicians,

171
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.310
um, and just as onslaught, you know,

172
00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.950
combined with a lack of information,

173
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:26.390
but I've described an epidemic crisis that led to a complete panic,

174
00:10:26.391 --> 00:10:27.224
but we're going to be,

175
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.600
we're going to be spending the next 10 years trying to figure this out.

176
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.110
