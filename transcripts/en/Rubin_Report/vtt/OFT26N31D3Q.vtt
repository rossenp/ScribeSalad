00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:08.843
<v 0>Hello.</v>

2
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.410
<v 1>People of the internet. I'm Dave Rubin.</v>

3
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.050
It is December 1st, 2020.

4
00:00:15.051 --> 00:00:19.670
We are finally in the 12th and final month of this

5
00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:21.770
very bizarre year, 2020.

6
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.240
It seems like time has sort of no meaning anymore. Like we could be in December,

7
00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:28.640
maybe it's June, possibly it's February.

8
00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:33.200
Everything time has just sort of like stretched and been pulled and

9
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.670
pushed and thinned out. And it's just very, very weird. But yes,

10
00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:42.140
we are in the last month of the wackiest year,

11
00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:45.050
at least since I've been on this planet since 1976,

12
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.790
and we got a whole bunch to talk about before we do any of that stuff and get

13
00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:54.350
you caught up on some of the news of the day, uh, today is giving Tuesday.

14
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.110
You guys may know about this. It's been going on for the last couple years,

15
00:00:57.111 --> 00:01:00.530
but this is often right after Thanksgiving. It's the end of the year.

16
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.180
People are trying to figure out, uh, where they can donate, uh, you know, some,

17
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.150
some nonprofits that they can give some money to and help some charities and

18
00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:12.800
things like that. Um, so I just made a donation and I just wanted to, uh,

19
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.490
remind you guys that there are all sorts of non-profits that you can give to

20
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.760
that are hopefully in line with some of your beliefs.

21
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.990
So instead of the government having to take from you and give to something that

22
00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:25.790
you don't necessarily believe in, uh,

23
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.520
if you've got a little extra money and you get a tax write off and everything

24
00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:31.400
else, that there are all sorts of great nonprofits that you can give to,

25
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.970
to help education, to help animals, to help elderly, to help homeless. I mean,

26
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:38.210
all of the things that, that we demand the government do,

27
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.650
you can often do for yourself.

28
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.820
So I just made a donation to animal hope and wellness foundation, uh,

29
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.770
which is where we got Clyde. And let's throw up the first picture of Clyde. Uh,

30
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.930
for those of you, I know most of, you know, Clyde already,

31
00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:55.520
but that's the day we got Clyde. That was the first day of lockdown.

32
00:01:55.521 --> 00:01:59.390
That's at animal hope and wellness. And some of you remember the story, uh,

33
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.690
Emma, our previous dog, she was 16 years old. She had cancer.

34
00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:06.020
She had just died a few months before, and I was about to go on a book tour.

35
00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:09.170
We weren't going to get a dog for about a year, but that first day of lockdown,

36
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:13.880
I heard that all these shelters were closing and I just ran over there because

37
00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:17.450
they were saying that they were going to have to put all these dogs down and

38
00:02:17.451 --> 00:02:19.430
animal hope and wellness is not a kill shelter,

39
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:22.490
but they had just rescued Clyde from a kill shelter.

40
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.070
His name wasn't even Clyde at the time, he didn't, he didn't even have a name.

41
00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:29.930
He had no tags or anything. Um, but they adjust, rescued him. He had already,

42
00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:32.570
they had signed the thing like he was going to be put down that day,

43
00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:37.160
this gorgeous one-year-old boxer pit mix. And we adopted him.

44
00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:39.290
I told David, Oh yeah, we'll foster him for a week,

45
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:42.020
but I knew what was going to happen. And now we've had them for months.

46
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.020
And he's just great. And here's a picture of him from this morning. I mean,

47
00:02:45.021 --> 00:02:47.930
look at those two pictures, right? One he's scared. He's nervous.

48
00:02:47.931 --> 00:02:50.630
You could see he's got that scar on his head. We had a little surgery.

49
00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:54.980
We took care of that. And this picture is from, uh, from this morning, that's,

50
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.260
uh, up on the roof and we were doing a little morning meditation and Clyde good.

51
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.450
So yes, I donated to animal hope and wellness,

52
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:05.370
which is animal hope and wellness.org/donate.

53
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.660
But I hope if you have a couple,

54
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.350
couple of extra bucks that you will do a little donating too,

55
00:03:10.351 --> 00:03:14.190
because there's all sorts of organizations out there that lineup probably with

56
00:03:14.191 --> 00:03:18.870
your beliefs and the things that you want, I want to get done in society.

57
00:03:18.871 --> 00:03:22.560
And it's kind of nice when you can help make it happen instead of demanding that

58
00:03:22.561 --> 00:03:25.320
we just take money from somebody else and, uh,

59
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.430
and force people to give away their money, uh,

60
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.220
through taxes instead of just doing it on your own. Okay guys.

61
00:03:32.221 --> 00:03:36.750
So the three topics that we are going to discuss today here. No good book.

62
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.670
Leave this first one, uh, an LA counters County supervisor.

63
00:03:41.671 --> 00:03:46.560
One of the people who voted three to two to shut down all of our

64
00:03:46.561 --> 00:03:50.580
businesses, basically from Thanksgiving up into Christmas till December 20th.

65
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.580
And then of course we know that they'll extend it into Christmas as well,

66
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.790
and put these draconian laws and you can't even have people in your house and

67
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.470
all a series of all sorts of stuff,

68
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.180
but literally closed down all the restaurants.

69
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.820
The only restaurants we have in LA right now, we're just take out.

70
00:04:02.821 --> 00:04:07.080
You cannot even sit outdoors. So think about all these restaurant tours,

71
00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:11.400
these people who have built all these makeshift outdoor things spend more money

72
00:04:11.401 --> 00:04:13.830
when they don't have it because no one's going to restaurants now.

73
00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:17.220
They can't even use that. It's absolutely insane. Well,

74
00:04:17.221 --> 00:04:18.060
you're not going to believe this.

75
00:04:18.061 --> 00:04:22.080
One of the ladies who voted three to two to close down all the restaurants,

76
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.090
guests, where she went right after the vote. Yeah. She went out to eat. Yeah.

77
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.300
Shocking, shocking. So we're going to talk about that. Uh,

78
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.540
then we're going to talk about time magazine time magazine was once a week

79
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.950
expected magazine.

80
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.400
When we had sort of respected places of journalism in the United state States.

81
00:04:38.401 --> 00:04:41.850
It was a long time ago. And for your kids, I know you don't remember it. Uh,

82
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.220
but they have put out their person of the year.

83
00:04:44.221 --> 00:04:47.700
Nominees edited includes such incredible lefty.

84
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.860
All-stars like Stacey Abrams, Andrew Cuomo, Dr. Fowchee, Gretchen Whitmer,

85
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.330
BLM activists, and much more so we'll discuss that.

86
00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.350
And, uh,

87
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.020
and then finally I thought this would be interesting because there's still so

88
00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:04.500
much going on with the election. And you know, I'm trying,

89
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:05.880
not only for you guys, but even,

90
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.670
and for myself not to get totally lost in the weeds like, Oh,

91
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.470
this little thing happened and that leads to this.

92
00:05:10.471 --> 00:05:14.220
And I'm trying to just sort of take in a whole bunch of information and,

93
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.590
and filter it and decipher it in a way that,

94
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.270
that makes it understandable to you guys.

95
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.180
But also so that I don't get completely overloaded. Well,

96
00:05:21.181 --> 00:05:25.050
the Federalist did a really nice room cap, uh,

97
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.400
and they did an article called five more ways. Joe Biden, wait, five more ways.

98
00:05:29.401 --> 00:05:32.940
Joe Biden, outperform, uh, sorry, it's called five more ways. Joe Biden,

99
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.830
outperformed election norms.

100
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.060
And it's their way of sort of debunking some of them strange things that have

101
00:05:39.061 --> 00:05:39.661
happened here.

102
00:05:39.661 --> 00:05:43.500
And basically these are the kinds of things that you'd have to believe happened

103
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.570
if you, if you believe that Joe Biden won. So, so we'll do all of that. Uh,

104
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.140
before we get to all of that though, I want to talk to you.

105
00:05:52.141 --> 00:05:54.090
Good people about bill BARR.

106
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.500
Are you looking for a new protein bar that tastes like a candy bar? Well,

107
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.010
I've got just the one for you. It's in my hand right now, I'm pointing to it.

108
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:05.480
People built bars are super tasty and come in 18 amazing flavors. As you know,

109
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.870
I'm a cookies and cream guy built bars are covered in a hundred percent

110
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:09.381
chocolate,

111
00:06:09.381 --> 00:06:13.400
including both nut and nut-free flavors that are soft and easy to chew with the

112
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:16.370
holidays just around the corner. We're between Thanksgiving and Christmas.

113
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:17.510
It's easy to slip up,

114
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.680
which is why built bars are the perfect alternative to pie for the health

115
00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:22.514
conscious guy.

116
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:26.270
I can actually lose or maintain weight while indulging in a delicious treat.

117
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.580
Bill bars are low calorie, low sugar, high protein,

118
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:32.270
and high fiber go to bill barr.com and use promo code Rubin.

119
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:37.130

120
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.230

121
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:43.543
And now back to me.

122
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.980
<v 2>All right, so we'll start.</v>

123
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.050
<v 1>Here in LA. I know every day,</v>

124
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:51.770
some other insane thing happens here in Los Angeles,

125
00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:56.270
happens in California and not all of you watching are from LA or from

126
00:06:56.271 --> 00:07:00.500
California. God bless you and good work. Good smart life decisions for you guys.

127
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.710
Um, you know, people often ask me, what am I doing here? Like,

128
00:07:03.711 --> 00:07:05.780
that's the main thing I get, you know, I do these shows.

129
00:07:05.781 --> 00:07:09.080
I talk about how ridiculous it is and all that stuff. And people say, well,

130
00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:11.360
what are you doing there? Why do you pay the high taxes?

131
00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:15.020
Why do you deal with the people? You know, the lockdowns, all that stuff.

132
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.340
And the truth is there's really nothing left here, but the weather,

133
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.500
the weather is perfect. It's absolutely perfect. Pretty much all the time.

134
00:07:24.501 --> 00:07:28.100
It's like 75 and sunny, no humidity every day. This week,

135
00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:31.220
we're in the middle of the winter right now. So that is the reason.

136
00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:34.220
And you know, if you, if you live in LA you're in some Soquel,

137
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:37.730
you're in some proximity to the beach and that kind of stuff, it purely is a,

138
00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:40.430
is a weather thing for me at this point. Like at some point,

139
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.650
I guess it was partly because Hollywood was here.

140
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:47.330
And I guess what I do is at least somehow ancillary related to entertainment and

141
00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:51.620
Hollywood and all that, but the whole business has imploded and deservingly. So,

142
00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:53.450
so it's not even really because of that anymore.

143
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.660
And a lot of my friends have left. I do know a couple of nice people here.

144
00:07:56.661 --> 00:07:57.920
There's a couple of refugees. We,

145
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.680
we bring them in for dinners where they can speak freely. Uh,

146
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.560
but it's mostly about the weather. But anyway, uh,

147
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:06.500
this is just absolutely incredible. Uh,

148
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.580
I'm going to give you the quote here from Fox 11 Los Angeles, because, uh,

149
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.020
just out, well, we'll just,

150
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:17.000
let's just go to the quote just hours after Los Angeles County supervisor Sheila

151
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:21.680
cool voted to ban outdoor dining out Los

152
00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:26.480
Angeles counties, 31,000 restaurants over COVID-19 safety concerns.

153
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.490
She visited a restaurant in Santa Monica where she dined indoors cool referred

154
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:35.180
to the outdoor dining as a most dangerous situation.

155
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.840
She then dined at Alfresco. Uh, she died.

156
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:43.820
She died at Alfresco at [inaudible] hours after she voted.

157
00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:47.270
Okay. So you understand what these people are doing.

158
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.990
So she was one of five people that voted three of the people voted to put us in

159
00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:54.530
further lockdown, destroy the restaurants. Two of them said, no, she,

160
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.630
no we're to keep them open. She was one of the ones that said yes,

161
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.850
but then it wasn't as if you make the vote.

162
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:01.110
And then we locked down at that moment.

163
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:04.050
There's still a couple day window before all the lock that's happened.

164
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:06.630
So she then decided, yeah, we're going to destroy all the restaurants.

165
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:09.860
We're going to lock everybody down. Okay. You know, and again, but they never,

166
00:09:09.861 --> 00:09:13.220
there's no science that proves any of this makes any sense or anything like

167
00:09:13.221 --> 00:09:17.360
that. Then if it was so dire lady,

168
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.860
Sheila, if it was so dire, why would you then go to an outdoor restaurant?

169
00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:24.740
Now it turns out she really likes this restaurant. It's really, she's really,

170
00:09:24.741 --> 00:09:27.800
she really enjoys Italian food apparently. And you know,

171
00:09:27.801 --> 00:09:32.030
she wanted a little pasta, you know, little pen, a little food silly. Uh,

172
00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.410
and she went out there and died.

173
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.670
But the hypocrisy it's the hypocrisy more than anything else.

174
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:42.440
If these people behaved in a way that was consistent with their idiotic

175
00:09:42.441 --> 00:09:46.610
voting records and, and all of the things they say,

176
00:09:46.611 --> 00:09:47.780
that would be one thing, by the way,

177
00:09:47.781 --> 00:09:49.970
I would still be against all the lockdowns and the rest of it.

178
00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.960
But that would be one thing, but they want rules for you and not for them. They,

179
00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:55.100
she knows.

180
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:59.240
She knows that it's perfectly fine to go to a restaurant,

181
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:03.470
but she decides to the lock them down. And then she does it herself. I mean,

182
00:10:03.471 --> 00:10:04.660
try to imagine the goal,

183
00:10:04.661 --> 00:10:09.320
like really try to imagine you put this vote in 31,000 restaurants with an

184
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:13.010
untold amount of employees and livelihoods and all that you say I'm going to

185
00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:16.310
further destroy those things. Can I get a, uh, can I get a pasta?

186
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.500
Let me get passed over here. Let me get a, a pen pen, a pasta, please. Uh,

187
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:25.760
this is the S her spokesman said she loves El Forno, uh,

188
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:26.990
and has been sad.

189
00:10:26.991 --> 00:10:30.380
And to see it like so many restaurants suffer from a decline in revenue.

190
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.310
She ate,

191
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:35.720
they're taking appropriate precautions and sadly will not dine there again until

192
00:10:35.721 --> 00:10:38.450
our public health order per permit. Well,

193
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.820
she's the one that is doing the public health order.

194
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.960
And if they're the appropriate precautions, then why can't the rest of us do it.

195
00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:50.510
None of this makes any sense. These people are Tarion lunatics.

196
00:10:50.511 --> 00:10:53.270
And as you know, I am a freedom extremist,

197
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:57.380
and I believe that people should be allowed to eat at restaurants if they so

198
00:10:57.381 --> 00:11:02.330
choose. I didn't think when, uh, 2020 began back in January 11 months ago,

199
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.280
that saying that people should be able to eat outdoors.

200
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.770
And Los Angeles was going to be a controversial statement.

201
00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:10.340
I realized that now it puts you on a list and I'm probably in a lot of trouble.

202
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:15.320
Um, but that's where I'm at people you should be allowed to eat at restaurants.

203
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:20.480
These people who govern us are complete morons and deserve none of our

204
00:11:20.481 --> 00:11:24.110
respect or, or even not even respect, they don't deserve our respect.

205
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:25.790
And they don't even deserve our attention.

206
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.010
Like maybe we just need to start ignoring them. And I mean,

207
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.040
that's at every level, like our police officers should start ignoring them.

208
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.490
Like police officers shouldn't act like the jackboots of the state showing up at

209
00:11:34.491 --> 00:11:36.380
people's houses and clone, right. Closing restaurants.

210
00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.510
And if you're a restaurant tour, open up your restaurant,

211
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:42.470
I saw a story this morning. There's some guy in a, in Staten Island in New York,

212
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.080
who's just opened, bring up his restaurant. He's not charging.

213
00:11:45.081 --> 00:11:48.560
You can make a donation and you know, let's see what happens. Like,

214
00:11:48.561 --> 00:11:50.570
are they going to come for him? Cuomo probably will.

215
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.100
But this is how you fight back. It starts with us. Uh, okay.

216
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:57.730
Let's move on to the second story because you guys know time magazine,

217
00:11:57.731 --> 00:12:00.460
I'm sure none of you subscribe to it anymore. I don't know how many,

218
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.460
how many people are actually subscribing to these things anymore. Uh,

219
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:08.440
and most places of journalism have destroyed themselves. Trump. I mean,

220
00:12:08.441 --> 00:12:10.300
you know, his, his greatest gift, you know,

221
00:12:10.301 --> 00:12:12.580
I think he taught people on the right how to fight back.

222
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:16.510
But his real greatest gift was just to completely unmask the,

223
00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:19.750
the partisan left the Democrat media as something that is,

224
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:24.270
that is in cahoots with the Dems it's it's,

225
00:12:24.271 --> 00:12:28.170
it's their PR agency. Perfect. Uh, so time magazine, you know,

226
00:12:28.171 --> 00:12:29.580
they do their person of the year,

227
00:12:29.581 --> 00:12:33.330
every year and their nominees and the political category this year includes

228
00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:38.160
Stacey Abrams, Andrew Cuomo, Dr. Fowchee, Gretchen Whitmore, BLM activists,

229
00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.470
and more. I'll give you a couple of some of the other names.

230
00:12:40.471 --> 00:12:44.880
So Fowchee 81% said that he should be the man of the year.

231
00:12:44.881 --> 00:12:47.730
He's given us all sorts of, uh, you know,

232
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.740
all sorts of very conflicting and confusing information on that Kamala Harris

233
00:12:52.741 --> 00:12:55.740
who pulled at basically 0% of the democratic primary.

234
00:12:55.741 --> 00:12:59.880
And then they just selected herb for social justice points. As the VB,

235
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.030
she got 68% Joe Biden, broken foot dementia.

236
00:13:03.031 --> 00:13:05.070
Joe Biden got 64 Stacey Abrams.

237
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:09.360
Who's literally never done anything other than lose a Georgia gubernatorial race

238
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:14.130
got 59 AOC. Who's a complete idiot, got 38 Cuomo, 35,

239
00:13:14.131 --> 00:13:17.010
Bernie Sanders, 23, Nancy Pelosi,

240
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:21.390
22 Whitmer who literally shut down, uh,

241
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:24.600
Michigan and told people that they can't garden at their own houses. Yeah,

242
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.470
she got 19%. Elizabeth Warren got 17%.

243
00:13:28.471 --> 00:13:30.600
She would have had 15%, but as a native American,

244
00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:32.490
they gave her two extra percentage points.

245
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.830
And then they did get a couple of people on the right on there.

246
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:39.420
Donald Trump got 8%, uh, Amy Komen Coney Barrett got 6%.

247
00:13:39.421 --> 00:13:40.890
Mike Pence got 3%.

248
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:45.780
I should also tell you that aim Amy Komi Barrett's 6% that was matched

249
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:50.220
by Cardi B, who also got 6%. So Amy Coney Barrett,

250
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:53.520
who is now on the Supreme court got 6%.

251
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:57.270
And so did Cardi B Cardi B, of course, uh, she's got the,

252
00:13:57.271 --> 00:14:01.110
the wet and the bucket and the whole thing. And, uh,

253
00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:05.520
that was worth 6% of support. Anyway, I mentioned, I mentioned all of this,

254
00:14:05.521 --> 00:14:09.600
basically, just that these things like these old structures that exist

255
00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:15.570
the time person of the year, this award, the Emmys,

256
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.410
the Oscars,

257
00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:20.490
all of these things that sort of felt like they meant something for a long time.

258
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.690
They just don't really mean anything anymore. If anything,

259
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.550
it's not that they don't mean anything.

260
00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.940
They probably mean the reverse of what they're supposed to, right?

261
00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:34.710
Like the person of the year, the person who changed the world,

262
00:14:34.711 --> 00:14:37.800
potentially hopefully in a positive way now they don't always do it in a

263
00:14:37.801 --> 00:14:41.310
positive way. I'm pretty sure Hitler was the person of the year at one point.

264
00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:44.010
So it's, it's someone who's just like affecting the world,

265
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:48.060
but this is just more just like fileting, a bunch of lefty politicians.

266
00:14:48.061 --> 00:14:51.350
It's just like boring. And no one cares about these things. And, and again,

267
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.270
all of these institutions, I mean,

268
00:14:53.271 --> 00:14:58.030
the beauty of it is all of these institutions, journalistic institutions,

269
00:14:58.031 --> 00:14:58.930
academic institutions,

270
00:14:58.931 --> 00:15:02.920
and everything else they're burning themselves down in the name of social

271
00:15:02.921 --> 00:15:06.040
justice. The danger of course, is that it's also coming to our government.

272
00:15:06.041 --> 00:15:09.430
I just saw we're going to cover this story tomorrow. But Janet Yellen, who is,

273
00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:14.080
I think Biden's nominee for treasury secretary, if I'm not mistaken, um,

274
00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.680
she just gave a speech this morning where she's talking about how the treasury

275
00:15:17.681 --> 00:15:22.300
will deal with climate justice and, and like just all of,

276
00:15:22.301 --> 00:15:26.050
and gender equality and all of that stuff that it's like,

277
00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:29.380
we moved past all of this. You guys are bringing all of this,

278
00:15:29.381 --> 00:15:32.470
the systemic racism that you're always talking about, your,

279
00:15:32.471 --> 00:15:34.390
the ones that are implementing it in the, the system.

280
00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.390
And that's why all of these institutions, they need to collapse.

281
00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.480
If you would've asked me two years ago to these institutions need to collapse.

282
00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.910
I think I was still sort of on the side of, no,

283
00:15:42.911 --> 00:15:45.190
we've got to fight to keep these things going,

284
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:50.080
but it's just become obvious that at virtually every layer,

285
00:15:50.081 --> 00:15:53.770
they've all become so corrupt that we have to let them collapse. And then,

286
00:15:53.771 --> 00:15:56.080
and then we'll see what happens there. Uh, so anyway,

287
00:15:56.081 --> 00:16:00.670
we shall see who becomes time magazine's person

288
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.310
of the year. You think it might, it may be,

289
00:16:03.311 --> 00:16:06.630
it would have been that Trump guy who had a lot to do with what was going on

290
00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.590
this year, but, uh, only 8% for Trump, but,

291
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.600
but 68% for Kamala Harris, I think the, uh,

292
00:16:13.601 --> 00:16:17.500
the evil cackling laugh got her a bonus 10%. Uh, okay.

293
00:16:17.501 --> 00:16:20.110
Let's move on to the third story, because I think this is probably the most,

294
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:21.400
most interesting of the day.

295
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.120
So the Federalist wrote an article called five more ways, Joe Biden,

296
00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.340
outperformed election norm.

297
00:16:27.341 --> 00:16:31.060
So I want to go through the five bullet points that they make out there.

298
00:16:31.061 --> 00:16:35.980
And basically what they're saying is there's a bunch of strange things

299
00:16:36.190 --> 00:16:40.150
that happened in this election, by the way, this is exactly now what, uh,

300
00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.720
Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani and Jen Ellis and the entire Trump team,

301
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.840
what they're talking about, they're sort of working in two different ways.

302
00:16:46.841 --> 00:16:49.750
We know that the Sidney Powell side of this thing is working on the dominion

303
00:16:49.751 --> 00:16:53.440
voting machines and whether they were actually turning Trump votes into Biden

304
00:16:53.441 --> 00:16:53.651
votes,

305
00:16:53.651 --> 00:16:57.430
or just throwing out massive Trump votes and why there were these very strange

306
00:16:57.431 --> 00:17:00.280
spikes and all sorts of weird hours, uh, that,

307
00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:04.540
that went like 97% for Biden and virtually nothing for Trump.

308
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:06.640
That's what the palace side.

309
00:17:06.641 --> 00:17:11.410
And then the Giuliani side is dealing with late ballots signatures that don't

310
00:17:11.411 --> 00:17:14.560
match duplicate ballots, a whole bunch of other stuff like that. So that's,

311
00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:17.080
that's all the stuff that we're going to see go through the courts over the next

312
00:17:17.081 --> 00:17:18.250
couple of weeks. But again,

313
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.370
because CNN and the New York times and everywhere else,

314
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.630
they're not really touching it.

315
00:17:22.631 --> 00:17:25.620
You've just got all of these people who either you're paying yeah.

316
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.940
Attention to it online. And you think that there's something there,

317
00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:30.040
or maybe you think that there's nothing there, but you know,

318
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.170
if there is something happening, right,

319
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.520
or you're just sort of a brainwash mainstream media NPC,

320
00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.190
and you don't even know that there's something going on.

321
00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:41.830
And imagine if Trump ends up winning, imagine if it gets to the court.

322
00:17:41.831 --> 00:17:45.910
And we find out that there was massive fraud that the dominion voting machines

323
00:17:45.911 --> 00:17:49.240
did things that there were all sorts of fraudulent ballots in, in Pennsylvania,

324
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.230
Arizona, every where else? Well, if that happens in a couple of weeks,

325
00:17:52.231 --> 00:17:53.280
just if it happens,

326
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:58.580
how half of the country will have no idea in a fact that there was anything even

327
00:17:58.581 --> 00:18:00.350
going on because the mainstream media refused.

328
00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:04.010
I used to talk about it and that that's why I'm left to talk about it,

329
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.230
I suppose. So let's go through these five bullet points,

330
00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.350
cause there's some interesting stuff here. Uh, number one 80 million votes,

331
00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:11.240
which is about what Trump got.

332
00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:14.570
A lot of Americans turned out for a Washington politician.

333
00:18:14.571 --> 00:18:17.060
Who's been in office for nearly 50 years. That's of course,

334
00:18:17.061 --> 00:18:21.590
Joe Biden consider this no incumbent president in nearly a century and a

335
00:18:21.591 --> 00:18:26.480
half has gained votes in a reelection campaign and still lost.

336
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:31.220
Now we know that Trump got probably 11 or 12 million more votes than he did

337
00:18:31.221 --> 00:18:33.560
last time. Yet he still was very strange.

338
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:36.830
And Joe Biden got the most amount of votes all times,

339
00:18:36.831 --> 00:18:40.970
supposedly even crushing Barack Obama seems a little strange. Okay.

340
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.340
What's also strange about Joe Biden.

341
00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.090
He was winning despite losing most bellwether counties.

342
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:52.190
Biden is set to become the first president in 60 years to lose the States of

343
00:18:52.191 --> 00:18:56.120
Ohio and Florida on his way to election. Now that is obviously possible,

344
00:18:56.121 --> 00:18:58.250
but it's a little strange for a century.

345
00:18:58.251 --> 00:19:01.700
These States have consistently predicted the national outcome and they've been

346
00:19:01.701 --> 00:19:05.690
considered roughly representative of the American melting pot as a whole,

347
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.720
despite national polling given by an elite in both States,

348
00:19:08.721 --> 00:19:12.620
he lost Ohio by eight points and Florida more than three. So, all right,

349
00:19:12.621 --> 00:19:15.470
that doesn't prove that anything nefarious is going on,

350
00:19:15.471 --> 00:19:19.820
but it's just an interesting point of information. Uh, number three,

351
00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:24.620
Biden, trailed Clinton, except in a few in a select few cities,

352
00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.850
uh, Patrick, Basham a pollster with an accurate, accurate track record.

353
00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:33.230
And the director of the democracy Institute in DC highlighted two

354
00:19:33.231 --> 00:19:36.980
observations made by fellow colleagues, polling guru,

355
00:19:36.981 --> 00:19:41.060
Richard Barris of big data poll and election analyst, Robert Barnes,

356
00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:42.650
Robert Barnes, I've had on the show by the way,

357
00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:47.990
Barris noted a statistical oddity from 2020s, election returns, Biden,

358
00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:53.360
underperformed, Hillary Clinton in every major Metro area around the country,

359
00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.890
except for Milwaukee, Detroit, Atlanta, and Philadelphia.

360
00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:03.170
That is kind of interesting, right? That seems like something is kind of there.

361
00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.290
Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia,

362
00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:11.300
Pennsylvania seemed every other city that was

363
00:20:11.301 --> 00:20:14.480
supposed to go the way it did did those were completely out of whack,

364
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:19.040
seemed a little odd. All right, but again, anything's possible. Number four,

365
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.310
Biden one, despite Democrat losses, everywhere else.

366
00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:26.270
Randy DeSoto noted in the Western journal that Donald Trump was pretty much the

367
00:20:26.271 --> 00:20:31.190
only incumbent president in us history to lose his reelection while his own

368
00:20:31.191 --> 00:20:34.820
party gain seats in the house of representatives. Now that's a bite of miracle.

369
00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:36.320
Let let's unpack this one for a little bit,

370
00:20:36.321 --> 00:20:38.690
because remember we were being told blue wave is coming.

371
00:20:38.691 --> 00:20:41.270
The Democrats are going to pick up all these seats in the house.

372
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:42.860
If I'm not mistaken at this point,

373
00:20:42.861 --> 00:20:45.680
the Republicans have picked up about 27 seats.

374
00:20:45.681 --> 00:20:48.130
We can maybe just fact check on the flyer.

375
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.440
I have no doubt that you guys will check it in the comment section,

376
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:55.230
but about 26, seven seats and they didn't lose any seats.

377
00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:59.430
So you see, uh, it's very odd that down ticket, they did incredibly well.

378
00:20:59.431 --> 00:21:03.840
But the incumbent president who was clearly the national leader with a 95%

379
00:21:03.841 --> 00:21:06.480
approval rating in his own party, he lost,

380
00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.600
but they picked up all the down ticket stuff. It just seems odd.

381
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:11.070
That's all I'm saying. It just seems a little odd.

382
00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.840
And number five Biden overcame Trump's commanding primary vote

383
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:20.550
in the past primary vote totals have been remarkably remarkably accurate in

384
00:21:20.551 --> 00:21:23.250
predicting general election winners, political analyst,

385
00:21:23.251 --> 00:21:27.660
David Chapman highlighted three historical facts before election. Oh,

386
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:31.980
you know what? I think I'm missing those, those three historical facts. Uh,

387
00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:36.300
all right. Um, the point I, well, I know what they are in essence,

388
00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:39.570
they'd all boils down to the fact that Trump did unbelievably well in the

389
00:21:39.571 --> 00:21:40.260
primaries.

390
00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:44.160
There was no real reason for anyone to vote for Trump in the primaries, right?

391
00:21:44.161 --> 00:21:47.700
Like he was obviously going to be the Republican nominee. It didn't,

392
00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:49.620
there was nobody running against him in essence,

393
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.650
but the numbers that he showed up on top of,

394
00:21:52.651 --> 00:21:57.180
if you look at the rallies and not only the rallies that Trump was at all over

395
00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:58.080
in the middle of the country,

396
00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:01.650
but you saw what it was like when I went to the Beverly Hills rally here and

397
00:22:01.651 --> 00:22:05.580
rallies that were popping up all over in these car rallies all over the place

398
00:22:05.581 --> 00:22:10.380
and everything else, I get all just feels a little bit, a little bit odd. Oh,

399
00:22:10.381 --> 00:22:14.010
okay. I've got the, uh, I've got the three, uh, bullet points here,

400
00:22:14.011 --> 00:22:16.050
the Chapman highlighted. So here we go. First,

401
00:22:16.051 --> 00:22:20.760
no incumbent who has received 75% of the total primary vote

402
00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:22.260
has lost reelection.

403
00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.220
Second president Trump received 94% of the primary vote,

404
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:30.660
which is the fourth highest of all time higher than Dwight Eisenhower, Nixon,

405
00:22:30.661 --> 00:22:32.400
Clinton, or Obama. In fact,

406
00:22:32.401 --> 00:22:37.320
Trump is the only one of five incumbent since 1912 to receive

407
00:22:37.321 --> 00:22:39.630
more than 90% of the primary vote. So again,

408
00:22:39.631 --> 00:22:42.420
he did incredibly well in the primaries and it was about the numbers that he

409
00:22:42.421 --> 00:22:45.580
turned out when he was in essence voting, running against nobody. Uh,

410
00:22:45.581 --> 00:22:46.410
and finally,

411
00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:50.220
Trump set a record for most primary votes received by an incumbent with more

412
00:22:50.221 --> 00:22:54.060
than 18 million people turning out for him in 2020. So that,

413
00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:58.860
that gets to that point. So anyway, look, all of this, all of these things,

414
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:04.410
uh, are not proof of anything. They are, they are not proof of fraud.

415
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.930
They are not proof votes were switched.

416
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:11.100
They are strange themes often going back a hundred years or so,

417
00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:14.160
that are at least we're thinking about. And if we don't,

418
00:23:14.161 --> 00:23:17.730
if we don't discuss across any of these, or if, if you bring these things up,

419
00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:22.800
if you're immediately dismissed as a conspiracy theorist or a kook or a

420
00:23:22.801 --> 00:23:26.670
nutbag or whatever it is, or a deplorable, uh, then,

421
00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:31.080
then we've got a real problem. And as I said before, we're seeing right now,

422
00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:35.190
um, in some of these States, the fights are still going on.

423
00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.400
Sidney Powell is still saying she's got something in there trying to move it

424
00:23:38.401 --> 00:23:41.640
through the courts from day one. What have I said?

425
00:23:41.641 --> 00:23:46.640
And I will gladly be quoted on this. And with all my haters, edit my videos.

426
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.740
Hopefully they won't selectively edit this.

427
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:52.280
I am not saying that anything actually happened.

428
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.910
We have to go to where the evidence is. And at the end, if they get,

429
00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.710
if it all gets through the courts and they say, well,

430
00:23:57.711 --> 00:24:01.610
nothing actually nefarious happened. This was totally legit then. So be it, Joe,

431
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:06.140
Joe Biden or Kamala Harris will be president. But if something happened,

432
00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:08.510
it is not even if something happened,

433
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:13.850
it is the duty of the American system to make sure that people believe

434
00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:17.000
in the system have faith in the system. And how do you do that? Well,

435
00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:20.570
you can audit elections. You can confirm things.

436
00:24:20.571 --> 00:24:22.220
You can have things go to the courts.

437
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:24.650
And right now we're watching that system play out. And by the way,

438
00:24:24.651 --> 00:24:26.990
if you don't think something's a little odd here,

439
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.900
Kamala Harris has still not stepped down from the Senate, right?

440
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:34.160
Like she's supposed to be VP in, in a mere six weeks.

441
00:24:34.161 --> 00:24:37.490
Why hasn't she stepped down from the Senate? That, that does seem a little odd.

442
00:24:37.491 --> 00:24:39.260
They do seem like they're getting a little nervous.

443
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:41.690
Chuck Schumer was on the floor of the house yesterday,

444
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.830
demanding that even before I know figuration,

445
00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.710
meaning before January 20th, that the, uh,

446
00:24:48.711 --> 00:24:53.480
that the Congress should start voting on Biden's nominees for all of these

447
00:24:53.481 --> 00:24:56.960
different positions. It's like, well, no, why would we do that?

448
00:24:56.961 --> 00:24:59.510
And of course he's saying it because of COVID and the emergency, blah, blah,

449
00:24:59.511 --> 00:25:02.750
blah, blah. Anyway, I think, I just think there's more things happening here,

450
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:07.660
uh, than certainly you're gonna see on mainstream media. Uh, okay guys, I got a,

451
00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:11.810
a hectic day. Uh, so I'm going to jump, but just a reminder, uh,

452
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:16.190
it is giving Tuesday. So if you've got a couple extra bucks to spare,

453
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:17.420
there's all sorts of interesting.

454
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:21.590
Non-profits just do something that lines up with your own beliefs and that's it,

455
00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:24.740
whatever, whatever that is, if you want to help veterans, help elderly people,

456
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:29.270
animals, education, whatever it is, uh, you know, this,

457
00:25:29.271 --> 00:25:31.550
this is the day to do it. Uh, and as I said,

458
00:25:31.551 --> 00:25:35.360
I donated to animal hope and wellness.org,

459
00:25:35.361 --> 00:25:38.210
which is where we got Clyde and they just do great stuff. They actually go,

460
00:25:38.211 --> 00:25:40.460
if you go to their site, animal health and wellness.org,

461
00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:42.830
they have pictures of all the animals that they rescue.

462
00:25:42.831 --> 00:25:45.950
And usually they rescue animals from, uh,

463
00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.110
from places like Vietnam and China and things like that,

464
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:49.860
dogs that are going to be eaten. And they,

465
00:25:49.861 --> 00:25:53.510
they often they'll have dogs there that are missing legs and missing eyes and

466
00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:57.500
all sorts of stuff. Um, and I, I go off into the, well,

467
00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.900
now you can't go because you have to make an appointment, everything else.

468
00:25:59.901 --> 00:26:03.620
But in normal times, I usually just go there and say hi to the animals.

469
00:26:03.621 --> 00:26:06.740
And there, there are a lot of good people that work there. Uh, by the way, guys,

470
00:26:06.741 --> 00:26:11.390
you can watch part one of my interview with Douglas Murray, the brilliant dare.

471
00:26:11.391 --> 00:26:13.580
I say, the brilliant Douglas Murray,

472
00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:18.050
which is up on our YouTube channel right now. That's all.

473
00:26:18.051 --> 00:26:19.880
If you want to communicate with me directly, uh,

474
00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:23.180
join us@rubinreport.com and I'll see you tomorrow.
