00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.130
<v 0>Prudence means being sensible,</v>

2
00:00:02.131 --> 00:00:04.500
thinking carefully through what will this mean for the community?

3
00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:06.420
What will it mean for them? The next generation?

4
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.410
So what the West has really done is Rob its children and his grandchildren are

5
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.970
the things that we've taken for granted.

6
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.890
<v 1>I'm Dave Rubin, and this is the Rubin report. As long as you're here,</v>

00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:22.340
don't forget to click that little subscribe button and tap that bell over there

8
00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:25.040
so that you actually see our video is crazy. I know. All right,

9
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.940
joining me today is the former deputy prime minister of Australia,

10
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.960
a relentless fighter for freedom and the host of conversations with

11
00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:35.690
John John Anderson. Welcome to the Rubin report.

12
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.930
I am very happy to have you here because I'll start by saying that something

13
00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:44.750
that I'd never have told you in person, even though we've met a couple of times,

14
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.530
you reached out to me about three years ago, right?

15
00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:51.470
When we built this studio and the show was taken off,

16
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.480
there was a nice little bump in what we were doing.

17
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.750
And you reached out to me or your people reached out to me and said,

18
00:00:56.751 --> 00:00:57.441
John Anderson,

19
00:00:57.441 --> 00:01:00.170
former deputy prime minister of Australia would like to chat with you.

20
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.790
He's coming to LA. And it was really the first time that I thought,

21
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.570
Whoa, this thing is seriously international.

22
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.210
That the conversations that I'm having are seriously important.

23
00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:14.660
And we had a great breakfast where we talked about freedom and conversation and

24
00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:18.170
all of those things. And since we've done a couple events together, um,

25
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.120
so I guess my first question is you've been in this fight for a long

26
00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:23.954
time.

27
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.790
When did you start becoming aware that there was something worldwide around

28
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:33.170
having decent conversations that was sort of becoming the new way of going about

29
00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:35.350
discourse? Well, he might.

30
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.810
<v 0>My initial sort of concerns around freedom were largely economic.</v>

31
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.340
So I was part of a coalition government in Australia from,

32
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.430
uh, 1996 to 2007.

33
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.160
And we were a reforming government.

34
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.570
Our emphasis on freedom was economic freedom so that we would not pass on debt

35
00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:57.290
burdens and lack of opportunities to young people. And that was my focus.

36
00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.150
I think for me,

37
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:04.100
it was after the great financial crisis and you saw the blame

38
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.590
game started to really play out.

39
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.200
And I started to see that we needed to make major adjustments

40
00:02:12.201 --> 00:02:14.720
to the way we ran our economies in the West.

41
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.870
They're all hopelessly indebted with the exception of a few places like

42
00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:22.310
Australia. Um, but we wouldn't do it. We wouldn't own what we'd done.

43
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.460
And you started to see the shouting become very shrill.

44
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.600
Now it hadn't started then,

45
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.080
but you asked when I started to realize this is a real problem.

46
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.370
It was about that point because I started to see that that actually understood

47
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:36.170
properly in democracies, governments,

48
00:02:36.171 --> 00:02:40.790
downstream of culture and socioeconomics and the whole,

49
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.680
um, Lehman brothers collapsed was about, uh, collapsing standards. But again,

50
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.090
you didn't have a grappling with what had gone on in terms of the ethics of it,

51
00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:52.580
bankers, instead of saying, what should I do?

52
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.060
How should I behave rather than what can I get away with?

53
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.410
How can I build a bigger bundle for me? Uh,

54
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.350
and for those around me and hang, you know,

55
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.070
the people who bank with us and have trusted in us and rely on us. I thought,

56
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.070
and I started to think this is getting really serious,

57
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.700
but then it was the nature of the debate because it wasn't a debate anymore.

58
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.600
Now you can't get good public policy without a good debate,

59
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.200
and you can't have a good debate without a reasonable degree of respect for the

60
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:21.820
other person's dignity and standing.

61
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.760
<v 1>So it's interesting because I was a struggling standup when Lehman brothers</v>

62
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.930
crash. And I used to work at a comedy club handing out tickets in time square,

63
00:03:30.931 --> 00:03:34.200
right on the corner. I think it was, it was either 50th or 51st and Broadway.

64
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.410
That's where the Lehman brother building wasn't it was this huge lit up,

65
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.710
you know, massive digital display building. And I remember when it,

66
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.930
when it went down, it seems like another lifetime ago,

67
00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:47.680
but what's it like to be one of the guys going, Hey, everybody, we're,

68
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:49.590
we're about to go off a cliff here. I mean, that's,

69
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.240
that's not what politicians want to do.

70
00:03:51.241 --> 00:03:53.850
They want to always give everybody all the things that.

71
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.120
<v 0>That was part of the problem. Yeah. Yeah. There is no doubt.</v>

72
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.210
We need to understand that a lot of this rot started in the 1960s.

73
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.550
We gave up talking about, you know, the big sort of, uh, uh, meta narratives.

74
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.240
You know, who am I? What am I, where do I fit? How does the world work?

75
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.680
It's all too hard.

76
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.980
And you can understand that in a way we'd seen horrific Wars would say in the

77
00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:18.900
great depression let's live for us now. And in an age of cheap credit,

78
00:04:18.901 --> 00:04:21.360
we started to rack up debt right across the Western world.

79
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.840
And now it's not as if I'm singling out one country, your country or my country,

80
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.050
we're all in, we've all done it.

81
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.640
And here's the rub in a democracy. So you can say to Mr. Congressman,

82
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.050
um, now, listen, I'll give you my vote. If you promise me X, Y, or Z, and Mr.

83
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.880
Congressman might know instinctively.

84
00:04:38.881 --> 00:04:40.830
If he knows the stuff you want to have many of them,

85
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.580
but shouldn't single out American Congress and a lot of politicians, no,

86
00:04:44.581 --> 00:04:48.030
as much as they should. Yeah. They might refer on us. I look,

87
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.850
and that is not a good way to do it. We can't afford it.

88
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.130
It'll come against your children and your grandchildren.

89
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.090
Unfunded liabilities have pretended to be a nightmare, but we said, not now,

90
00:04:57.091 --> 00:04:58.170
you don't get to have that. All right,

91
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.000
I'll give it to you because it's on the never, never,

92
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.080
and Kings from of old have known that until the credit runs out,

93
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.930
you can live pretty well. But when the credit does run out,

94
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.690
it's a very different story. So it really,

95
00:05:09.691 --> 00:05:13.530
I think it has this Genesis in the sixties and this idea that it's all about me.

96
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.050
Um, I will do what I like with my life, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

97
00:05:19.051 --> 00:05:22.530
We abandoned the golden rule. Do unto others as you'd have them do unto you.

98
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.360
It's all about me now because most people don't live like that.

99
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.120
But that became the sort of prevailing ethos, right?

100
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.900
<v 1>We live like that in our own lives, right? I mean, sometimes you do.</v>

101
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.500
Or most of us have been in debt at some point or racked up too much credit card

102
00:05:37.501 --> 00:05:40.620
stuff or whatever it is, but you would never just, well, you can't. I mean,

103
00:05:40.621 --> 00:05:42.360
that's the thing as a, as an individual,

104
00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:46.650
you can keep just getting more credit as you keep not paying things,

105
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.630
but somehow in governments, we seem to be able to do that.

106
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.830
<v 0>Well, I think that, you know, it takes two to tango. I think the electorate,</v>

107
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.500
the voters, if you like have demanded too much,

108
00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.500
but politicians so should have known better right across the West have not been

109
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:03.680
prudent enough either. And there's an old fashioned word called prudence.

110
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.360
It was a classic virtue,

111
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.900
went along with integrity and courage and all of those other ones and prudence

112
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:09.734
disappeared.

113
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.710
And the story of Lehman brothers in many ways is the disappearance of prudence.

114
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.780
Prudence means being sensible,

115
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:17.150
thinking carefully through what will this mean for the community?

116
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:19.070
What will it mean for the next generation?

117
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.120
So what the West has really done is Rob his children and his grandchildren and

118
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:26.480
the things that we've taken for granted. And, and, and look,

119
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.710
I don't know what privilege is because you can adjust it a thousand ways.

120
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.710
But as I understand it, I think you and I would buy side. We're very,

121
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:38.000
very fortunate people we've grown up in free society. We've never really wanted,

122
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.830
um, uh, and, and so forth. But those things should never be taken for granted.

123
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.600
<v 1>Do you see a direct connection then between a stop,</v>

124
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:51.610
no longer asking the big questions in the sixties to then directly to, well,

125
00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:55.090
politicians then just say, here's more, here's more, here's more,

126
00:06:55.091 --> 00:06:55.990
here's more because,

127
00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:00.610
because the people no longer have the tools to understand why that's actually

128
00:07:00.611 --> 00:07:03.850
not good. That actually really explains what's happening here in America. Yeah.

129
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:04.541
<v 0>Yeah. Well,</v>

130
00:07:04.541 --> 00:07:09.280
I do think that I really do think that I think we are paying a terrible price as

131
00:07:09.281 --> 00:07:13.300
my personal view for washing out. You see, I think for a long time,

132
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.630
I don't think in, particularly in my country was ever particularly religious,

133
00:07:16.631 --> 00:07:18.580
but there was an idea that broadly speaking,

134
00:07:18.581 --> 00:07:21.160
the Christian view of the world love your neighbor.

135
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.150
You're accountable to a higher authority. You may dislike your neighbor,

136
00:07:25.151 --> 00:07:26.950
but they still have value and worth and dignity.

137
00:07:26.951 --> 00:07:28.870
And I have to respect that broadly seen as true.

138
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.870
Then it just became seen as one of many truths. Now,

139
00:07:31.871 --> 00:07:36.160
of course we know there's open hostility to, uh, traditional,

140
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.370
uh, underlying beliefs in the West on the part of,

141
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.080
I don't know what you call them.

142
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.110
You call them a lot of the intelligency or the politically correct,

143
00:07:44.111 --> 00:07:45.880
or the people who have the microphones or the elites,

144
00:07:45.881 --> 00:07:46.840
whatever word you want to use.

145
00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:50.170
There's enormous hostility there that says the stuff's dangerous and you

146
00:07:50.171 --> 00:07:52.840
shouldn't expose your children to it, but what's a substitute.

147
00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:57.820
What are we putting up in stead the audio of radical autonomy? I might,

148
00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.940
I will hazard a guess that you would understand exactly what I mean.

149
00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:04.750
If I said to you, I don't think you've ever find yourself in yourself.

150
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.250
You actually find yourself by relating to and serving others

151
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.410
and being considerate.

152
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.620
And in looking to see where you can make a difference,

153
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.090
not just for yourself all the time, self-centeredness just destroy.

154
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.990
<v 1>Well, that's the, I guess,</v>

155
00:08:19.991 --> 00:08:24.490
real irony of the situation as we've removed some of these traditional beliefs,

156
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.670
we've replaced them with authoritarian movements.

157
00:08:27.671 --> 00:08:29.920
They don't seem to be replaced by freer movements.

158
00:08:29.921 --> 00:08:32.530
If there was something so wrong with them, you would think, all right,

159
00:08:32.531 --> 00:08:35.530
well then freedom will replace them. But no,

160
00:08:35.531 --> 00:08:37.000
it seems to always go the other way.

161
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.630
<v 0>Well, very much so. I mean, I'm a great believer in the, in the freedoms.</v>

162
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.250
I don't think you can never run them unbundled.

163
00:08:42.251 --> 00:08:45.160
And we've had a debate in Australia. What's the first freedom and people say,

164
00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:47.050
well, obviously it's freedom of speech. I save it.

165
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.630
Cause that's the one by which you defend all the other freedoms.

166
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.650
But I think I want to join with Frank for Rudy, you know? And, and,

167
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.520
and that's an interesting story in itself. I would be seen as broadly speaking,

168
00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.390
classic liberal Stripe conservative. He would not, you know,

169
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:04.470
he was a student radical in the sixties. Wonderful and delightful man,

170
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:08.310
if you've not had him on getting Frank Rudy Kent university. Uh,

171
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:11.280
but he would say, if I said to him, I did, I said to him,

172
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.910
do you think freedom of speech is the first freedom? He said, no, no, no, no.

173
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:15.571
You said,

174
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:19.500
you should understand with your Christian convictions that actually it was

175
00:09:19.501 --> 00:09:20.820
freedom of conscience.

176
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.620
Our forebears were burning one another at the stake and my dreadful,

177
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.580
cruel appalling thing to do to another human being because I had a minority

178
00:09:29.581 --> 00:09:32.880
view. And after a while, people sort of said, well,

179
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.770
this isn't very consistent with Christian charity and it's pretty barbaric

180
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.700
and a stupid because the person with a minority view,

181
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:45.630
the day that we burned at the stake may in fact be part of a movement that

182
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.520
tomorrow, do you spend the majority,

183
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.800
do you sense that sort of where we're heading right now?

184
00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:54.330
And it really worries me. There's a, there's an aura of triumph.

185
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.160
