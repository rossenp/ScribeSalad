00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.000
<v 1>So, this is my place, the pineapple Hill grill in saloon. If you go to my page,</v>

2
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.310
you can see all the work I did for outdoor dining,

3
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.470
for tables being seven feet apart.

4
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.570
And I come in today because I'm organizing a protest and I came in to get

5
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.910
stuff for that. And I walk into my parking lot.

6
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.600
And obviously mayor Garcetti has approved.

7
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.590
<v 0>Has approved.</v>

8
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.460
<v 1>This, being set up for this being set up for,</v>

9
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.290
for a movie company.

10
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.220
I'm losing everything. Everything I own is being taken away from me.

11
00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.230
And they set up a movie company right next to my outdoor patio,

12
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.910
which is right over here.

13
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.230
And people wonder why I'm protesting and why I have had enough.

14
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.660
They have not given us money and they have shut us down. We can not survive.

15
00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:20.210
My staff could not survive. Look at this,

16
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.450
tell me that this is dangerous.

17
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.950
But right next to me, as a slap in my face,

18
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.450
That's safe. This is safe. 50 feet away.

19
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.970
This is dangerous.

20
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.950
Mayor Garcetti and Gavin Newsome is responsible for every single

21
00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:59.870
person that doesn't have unemployment that says not have a job and all the

22
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:02.960
businesses that are going under and we need your help.

23
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.200
We need somebody to do something about this.

24
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.080
<v 0>All right, everybody I'm live.</v>

25
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.210
This is Angela then of pineapple Hill saloon and Sherman. She,

26
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.570
she is the woman who put up that incredible video yesterday,

27
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.240
who I don't think you want it to become famous yesterday,

28
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.420
that the point of all of this, do you want to become famous?

29
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.740
What do you actually want to do?

30
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.560
<v 1>I would actually love to run my restaurant to run my successful,</v>

31
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.790
how that's been there since 1978 and feed my staff and take care of the

32
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:37.730
community. My restaurants will hub for the community.

33
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.640
The people themselves will come just to, to go.

34
00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:43.100
If we can't even open now for girls,

35
00:02:43.101 --> 00:02:46.190
a few for just to see us and just to commune.

36
00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:49.130
And I just want to open up, I just want to open it up.

37
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.630
<v 0>The restaurant. Yeah. And there are.</v>

38
00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:52.850
So even though you did your whole outdoor situation.

39
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.133
<v 1>You can go to,</v>

40
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.010
you can go to pH saloon or you can go to pineapple Hills swimming on Instagram.

41
00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:01.930
And there are photos. I took what little money I had.

42
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.860
I don't have big investors. I'm a one-woman shop. And I did a patio.

43
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:07.210
I followed all the rules.

44
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.230
The picnic tables were more than six feet apart or seven to 10 feet apart.

45
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:15.910
Some of them we did mass. We did temperatures. We did face shields. We did, um,

46
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.280
gel everywhere. Uh, I did flexing all through the inside.

47
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.310
And as soon as I got the plexity done, they made us go outside.

48
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.500
I turned a parking lot into an outdoor patio on my own with help with friends,

49
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:33.850
you know? So there's no way.

50
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.980
And there's no science that shows

51
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.210
it's hurting. Anybody I myself have had. I'm not rich.

52
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.380
I'm not Sheila. Really. I actually have had tuberculosis and shouldn't,

53
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.370
shouldn't be out.

54
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.860
<v 0>By the way, Sheila cruelly, the woman who voted was the deciding vote.</v>

55
00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:55.500
The three to two vote to shut down all the restaurants that I like who went out

56
00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:59.850
to eat that very night. She makes it work. Being told now over $300,000 a year.

57
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.580
<v 1>Yeah. She makes $25,000 a month,</v>

58
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.010
a month to sit at home and stay safely

59
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.960
inside and eat $40 meals from [inaudible] or

60
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.340
wherever she did it from.

61
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.100
But the point is this guys I've been working with the public since day one,

62
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.580
because I have not had the option to be inside, not working.

63
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.870
And I have not gotten the virus because we were safe.

64
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.860
We did everything, right. We did everything they asked and they did it.

65
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.600
They did it in the beginning. They give you,

66
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.840
they give you a little project that costs you, everything you have,

67
00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:39.420
and they think you won't reopen, or can't reopen,

68
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.540
then you find a way to open and then they change that on you.

69
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.630
<v 0>Well, listen, you're, you're a freaking hero. You are what America is all about.</v>

70
00:04:48.631 --> 00:04:52.140
Truly. What, what can people do to help you besides, besides coming out here?

71
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.033
What else can we do?

72
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.233
<v 1>What else can.</v>

73
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.300
<v 0>Tweet out the go fund me? I just did.</v>

74
00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.860
<v 1>Go fund me page,</v>

75
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.300
but just keep supporting us because there's so many restaurants and there's so

76
00:05:03.301 --> 00:05:04.051
many owners.

77
00:05:04.051 --> 00:05:06.780
I have friends that haven't even been able to open because they didn't have

78
00:05:06.781 --> 00:05:11.040
food. They're losing everything. So just keep supporting, please.

79
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.160
