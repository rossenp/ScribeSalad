<v 0>Hey everybody,</v>

2
00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:03.480
Clyde and I are just hanging out in the backyard trying to make the best of this

3
00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:05.940
lockdown situation. And I hope you are too,

4
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:09.840
whether you're locked down and quarantined or just roaming the streets,

5
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:12.540
aimlessly, uh, real quick guys, uh,

6
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.580
wanted to offer you all a free month access@rubinreport.com.

00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:21.030

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.360
we've got ad free video. We've got ad free podcast, Riva newsfeed.

12
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:40.710

I own all the content and the user data, no big tech nonsense involved. Uh,

14
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.930
you can communicate with me. You can communicate with other fans. Uh,

15
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.930
we're doing movie afternoons. We've watched a couple movies together,

16
00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:55.560
and then we do a giant zoom chat. We watched a movie contact two weeks ago.

17
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:57.420
We did Idiocracy last Sunday.

18
00:00:57.421 --> 00:01:00.870
We're going to do a giant dinner night where we're all going to cook the same

19
00:01:00.871 --> 00:01:04.710
dinner and watch each other cook and drink some wine and have some fun.

00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:21.300
bit easier. And, uh, I look forward to communicating.
