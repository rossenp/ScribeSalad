1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.280
<v 0>You go to Durham, North Carolina,</v>

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.900
the Durham public school system has half a dozen schools. They are,

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.060
they close their schools. Schools are not reopening. Okay.

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.700
So instead what they're doing, it's all online learning,

5
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.200
but they are operating six learning centers

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.020
and the learning centers are going to allow kids to come in and, you know,

7
00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:24.060
with their laptops and do the online learning.

8
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.890
Do you know where the learning centers are?

9
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.220
The learning centers at prison? What? No.

10
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.050
Well County prison sort of.

11
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.030
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

12
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.930
<v 2>You're in a reality war. I think that's what we call it. The culture war.</v>

13
00:00:44.931 --> 00:00:47.330
But I think it's starting to become the reality war.

14
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.380
That seems to me where we're.

15
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.840
<v 0>And the issue that you have.</v>

16
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.800
I don't know if the first one of these happened before you went off the grid,

17
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.130
but you had an image of an MSNBC reporter standing in front of.

18
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.580
<v 2>Oh, Ali Velshi yes. Ali bell. She's standing in front of thing.</v>

19
00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:04.220
There's nothing to see here. It's mostly peaceful. Uh, dude,

20
00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:06.050
there's a building exploding on the fire.

21
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.680
<v 0>Yeah. We got another one on CNN. About a week ago. We got another,</v>

22
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.830
it was the same thing. It was like, you could have just swapped the reporters.

23
00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:15.050
It was the exact same thing, same story, but.

24
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.640
<v 2>Why they can't stop?</v>

25
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.750
They can't stop because they're in so deep that to stop,

26
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.620
to stop that wheel that we were talking about before they would have to,

27
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.350
they they'd have to commit Harry Carey. You know what I mean?

28
00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:29.870
They'd have to just impale themselves on their own sword.

29
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.180
That would be the only way they would have to say yes,

30
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.110
we have been artists, Epic,

31
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.020
artists decades. Speaking of arts,

32
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.750
like is the New York times still a newspaper or did that thing wrap up then it

33
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:44.240
was, I mean, it was crumbling. I don't think it's been a newspaper.

34
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.100
They had announced they weren't going to do news anymore.

35
00:01:46.101 --> 00:01:49.220
Or they were going to run it by like a seventh grader. So yeah,

36
00:01:49.221 --> 00:01:51.680
the trans seventh grader was going to be able to correct things or something

37
00:01:51.681 --> 00:01:54.680
like that. All of the editors of the New York times now have to be trans seven.

38
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.530
<v 0>You have to trans all the kids. Well, actually,</v>

39
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.620
so the New York times is still whatever it is.

40
00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:02.600
I'm not gonna say it's a newspaper, but it's still whatever it is.

41
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.560
But on the school front, there is some really weird stuff going on. So.

42
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.050
<v 2>Right. Our school's opening like what's going on there?</v>

43
00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:10.460
Do we have schools anymore? So.

44
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.710
<v 0>Let's look at New York, obviously giant school system.</v>

45
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.610
<v 2>I come from the New York public. It comes as a matter of fact, it was right.</v>

46
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.650
<v 0>So New York has no plan to reopen restaurants.</v>

47
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.490
Nope, no plan. And he said maybe June of next year, they just don't know.

48
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.710
They're just shooting from the hip.

49
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.380
However schools are going to be back in session. It was just today.

50
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.200
It was delayed. So now they're going to push it. It was supposed to.

51
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.290
<v 2>Wait. So schools are not starting in New York next. Well,</v>

52
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:42.350
I guess it would be today. They have delayed it.

53
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.520
<v 0>But they, they didn't.</v>

54
00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:46.850
They got a lot of flack for saying the schools have to reopen and no one

55
00:02:46.851 --> 00:02:49.310
understood. Why are the schools? It made perfect sense to me.

56
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.380
You still want to indoctrinate the kids you've seen.

57
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.160
<v 2>In a good place to warehouse push the indoctrination costs.</v>

58
00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.280
<v 0>That's so weird that in outside of New York, you to Durham,</v>

59
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.450
North Carolina, the Durham public school system has half a dozen schools.

60
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.900
They are, they close their schools. Schools are not reopening. Okay?

61
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.540
So instead what they're doing, it's all online learning,

62
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.040
but they are operating six learning centers

63
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.860
and the learning centers are going to allow kids to come in and you know,

64
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:22.900
with their laptops and do the online learning.

65
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.730
Do you know where the learning centers are?

66
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.060
The learning centers at prison? What know?

67
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.950
<v 2>Well County prison, sort of.</v>

68
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.750
<v 0>The learning centers are in the schools, which are closed.</v>

69
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.013
Nobody gets better days.

70
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.290
<v 2>It gets better. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</v>

71
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.210
I know it's hard because I'm just getting back on the grid.

72
00:03:45.211 --> 00:03:48.510
So maybe my English isn't maybe what you're telling me is Durham has closed the

73
00:03:48.511 --> 00:03:49.344
schools.

74
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:50.970
<v 0>Totally closed. Then they've.</v>

75
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.520
<v 2>Announced that these centers were open where the kids can come with their</v>

76
00:03:53.521 --> 00:03:55.740
laptops to do remote learning, to do remote learning.

77
00:03:55.741 --> 00:03:57.630
And that is at the schools that are closed. That's correct.

78
00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.610
<v 0>Yeah. It makes sense. Doesn't it?</v>

79
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.170
But it actually w w what you're probably saying is though the only way that

80
00:04:04.171 --> 00:04:08.160
would work is if the school district charged the parents more money to come use

81
00:04:08.161 --> 00:04:08.611
the schools,

82
00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:10.980
which are closed to do the online learning from the schools that you can't go

83
00:04:10.981 --> 00:04:12.690
to. Right. That would, that would make sense.

84
00:04:12.691 --> 00:04:17.460
So in order to use the remote learning centers at the schools,

85
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.650
parents have to pay $140 a week, plus $35 registration fee.

86
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.540
Unless you're a bureaucrat who works for the government,

87
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.680
at which case you get a discount.

88
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.420
<v 2>What's the, what's the daily wire, uh, policy on the word.</v>

89
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.540
<v 0>Uh, Oh, it's, it's your show. My friend. We are right? Yeah.</v>

90
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.710
<v 2>You're bananas. Insane. But again,</v>

91
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.240
do you see what I'm saying? That there is nothing too stupid for this movement.

92
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.850
Yeah. There is nothing too insane for this movement. Yeah.

93
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.760
It will eat away and rot out.

94
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.130
Every whatever institution allows this stupidity in it

95
00:04:53.131 --> 00:04:53.964
will destroy it.

96
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.230
And that is what it sounds like is happening in Durham,

97
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.510
North Carolina speaking, but wait a minute,

98
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.820
why would they need more money to do that?

99
00:05:02.821 --> 00:05:06.960
I assume everyone's still paying taxes. They didn't tax rebates to the people.

100
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.300
They're all still paying taxes.

101
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.680
You're paying the exact amount of taxes that you always paid for.

102
00:05:10.681 --> 00:05:12.570
The public schools. The public schools are then closed,

103
00:05:12.571 --> 00:05:14.310
but then less people will be there. Correct.

104
00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:16.260
So you'd think you would be able to save a little money,

105
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.590
but then you still got to charge. So now, so in effect,

106
00:05:19.591 --> 00:05:22.590
only people with money will be able to send their kids to those schools.

107
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.780
But I thought they were also against school choice there.

108
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.820
And their brain is exploding.

109
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.620
<v 0>Here's the way to make sense of it. Has the government agency ever said,</v>

110
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.350
give me less money. Yeah. Has that ever happened?

111
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.590
<v 2>No. It's not the story of humanity. No, they run literally. I mean,</v>

112
00:05:37.591 --> 00:05:38.341
people don't believe this,

113
00:05:38.341 --> 00:05:41.880
but most government agencies run on a thing where they have to hit their budget.

114
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.820
Otherwise their budget gets cut. Nobody could run a business like that.

115
00:05:44.821 --> 00:05:46.740
I can't run my business like that, where I'm like,

116
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.230
I have to spend every freaking cent that I have.

117
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.470
Otherwise I'm not going to magically get well, because I'm not giving money.

118
00:05:52.471 --> 00:05:54.300
I have to earn money. You know? So,

119
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.320
so what I do is I save a certain amount in my business each year,

120
00:05:57.321 --> 00:06:01.430
so we can continue to grow or we might have some problems and then we can figure

121
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:01.960
it out.

122
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.280
<v 0>That's, that's completely foreign.</v>

123
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.190
That's completely foreign to a government economic genius over here.

124
00:06:06.191 --> 00:06:09.280
I know you are. And you know, actually speaking of, kind of naughty words,

125
00:06:09.281 --> 00:06:13.420
going blue. Yeah. I have to read you. There is a song that is.

126
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.140
<v 2>Bust out your glasses, like, excuse me, sir.</v>

127
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.030
<v 0>Now that we're going blue. So.</v>

128
00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.830
<v 2>There's a new song that's taken over the world.</v>

129
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.640
<v 0>And when I say taken over the world, I mean like, this is the story, okay.</v>

130
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.130
This is the story. So I don't even know, you know, I don't go blue on my show.

131
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.690
I'm very clean, clean, cut. I don't wear socks in my loafers. You know,

132
00:06:34.691 --> 00:06:38.200
I try to be, I can't say the name of this,

133
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.180
of this song without going blue.

134
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.520
<v 2>Be better. And you're hosting right now.</v>

135
00:06:42.521 --> 00:06:43.990
So I want you to do what you think is right. Would it be right?

136
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.730
Or if I just read it straight away.

137
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.770
<v 0>I would feel much better if you, so the song is called whap whap,</v>

138
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.990
right? It's my, it's my Cardi. Yeah.

139
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.160
W a P it's by Cardi B and this song, I mean,

140
00:06:57.161 --> 00:07:00.400
this is like at the, now the, the Anthem, the feminist Anthem.

141
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.130
<v 2>Cardi B. I'm not totally sure who she is,</v>

142
00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:05.350
but I know she was like fighting with people right before I went there.

143
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.620
<v 0>She, she supported Bernie Sanders.</v>

144
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.410
<v 2>Long nails. I think she, and I.</v>

145
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.600
<v 0>Think that's racist for you to say that, but yes, she does have long nails.</v>

146
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.600
So here's what this is. This song has just taken over everyone.

147
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:17.980
This is everyone's taken over.

148
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.330
<v 2>So I'll just, I guess I'll just read a little bit, yeah. Whores in this house,</v>

149
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.840
there, some horrors in this house, there's some horrors in this house.

150
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.640
There's some whores in this house, whole up. I said, certified freak,

151
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.840
seven days a week. Wet. Make that pull out game week.

152
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.760
That's good. Yeah. And then the chorus. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

153
00:07:39.761 --> 00:07:44.710
You with some sweet, bring a bucket and mop for this.

154
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.670
Mop for this. Oh, bring a bucket and not for this way. Cause he,

155
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.410
you gotta mop up. Then give me everything you got for this wet.

156
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:55.811
Uh,

157
00:07:55.811 --> 00:07:59.290
I'm going to not do the next paragraph because that's where they'll come for me.

158
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.180
If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics,
