00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.063
<v 0>Hello.</v>

2
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.550
<v 1>And people that get the internet wherever you are. It is nine, nine, 2020.</v>

3
00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:18.140
That's right. September 9th, 2020. And this is the Rubin report.

4
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.500
Direct message. I give you two or three,

5
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.540
possibly four stories in about 24 minutes. And then you move on with your life.

6
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.530
That's how we're doing it. Uh, we've got a bunch today. We've got four.

7
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.840
Although two of them, I'm going to kind of package.

8
00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:36.200
You're going to watch me package two stories into one story.

9
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.310
So you can pretend it's three, but if you need it to be four,

10
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.520
cause it's technically four that's for you to decide, uh,

11
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:46.700
there's a lot going on in the world, uh, real quick before I start, you know,

12
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.010
when I decided to do this show and I was talking to the blaze guys about doing

13
00:00:52.011 --> 00:00:53.930
sort of a semi daily news show and everything.

14
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.510
One of the things that I was worried about is, as I always tell you guys,

15
00:00:56.511 --> 00:00:58.640
I don't want to just add to the craziness,

16
00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:00.620
make everybody angry at all that stuff.

17
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.410
And I was worried that if I do a daily thing and I've been saying this for

18
00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:07.400
years, actually I've said this on my interview show for years and years.

19
00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:11.930
And in many other interviews that one of the problems is everyone does all of

20
00:01:11.931 --> 00:01:13.580
these daily shows where they're like, Oh,

21
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.760
I have to find 15 stories to talk about.

22
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.310
Then we got to clip them 800 different ways.

23
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.090
We got to get everybody lost in the algorithmic ClickHole of YouTube,

24
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:27.410
or just making sure that they're watching our show for an absolute hour at

25
00:01:27.411 --> 00:01:29.420
night, if it's cable news, whatever it might be.

26
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.670
And that that in and of itself keeps us all sort of as the hamster in the wheel.

27
00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:36.170
And we're just running, running, running all the time,

28
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.040
always looking for more stuff and we never stop and relax. Uh,

29
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.630
what I found in just the,

30
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.640
what four or five times that I've now done this new direct message show is that

31
00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:51.230
you can kind of pick a couple of things in the morning that are decent,

32
00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:55.550
that aren't going to make everybody crazy. And I think you can do them in,

33
00:01:55.551 --> 00:02:00.500
in a pretty decent way. So here we go. Number one, I think this is good news.

34
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.000
I think if you're not a partisan crazy lunatic,

35
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:08.540
you might think that this is good news. Uh,

36
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.340
Donald Trump has been nominated for the Nobel peace prize.

37
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.640
Now that seems good because the word peace is attached to it.

38
00:02:16.641 --> 00:02:21.140
And it would seem that maybe he did something that was a pro piece.

39
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:25.130
I'm already seeing tweets that, uh, you know, that's not the case. This is,

40
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.370
this is the ultimate insult to the fame Nobel prize,

41
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:31.180
which of course Barack Obama got like the day he became president,

42
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.460
even though he had accomplished absolutely nothing.

43
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.930
That was not a white power symbol, by the way,

44
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:39.680
that was just as we used to this used to be like a, just zero sorta thing or,

45
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:41.090
okay. Um,

46
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.620
but Donald Trump has been nominated for the Nobel peace prize, uh,

47
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.750
by a Norwegian lawmaker. Uh,

48
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.590
this is a guy who's in a right wing party.

49
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.030
It must be a scary right wing party in Norway. His name is Ty,

50
00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:59.740
bring Getty. I believe I'm pronouncing that correctly. Uh,

51
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.330
and he wrote in his novel.

52
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.860
<v 2>Nation letter that as it is expected,</v>

53
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.270
other meat middle Eastern countries will follow in the footsteps of the UAE,

54
00:03:09.271 --> 00:03:10.470
the United Arab Emirates.

55
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.360
This agreement could be a game changer that will turn the middle East into a

56
00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:16.350
region of COVID.

57
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.800
<v 1>Operation and prosperity. So before I go any further with what he said,</v>

58
00:03:19.801 --> 00:03:24.780
what he's talking about is in August Israel and the United Arab Emirates

59
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.400
signed, uh, at least some version of a peace accord, they're now having,

60
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.820
uh, travel between the countries and trade and things like that.

61
00:03:32.821 --> 00:03:36.180
There's an absolutely incredible video that I've seen on Twitter.

62
00:03:36.181 --> 00:03:38.790
I'm sure many of you seen it too with Benjamin Netanyahu,

63
00:03:38.791 --> 00:03:39.840
the prime minister of Israel,

64
00:03:39.841 --> 00:03:42.360
speaking to an official in the United Arab Emirates.

65
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.060
They're on the phone and they're speaking Hebrew, they're laughing.

66
00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:47.220
Like you can tell something decent happening here.

67
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.290
We're also being told that in the last couple of weeks,

68
00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:53.130
there's talks now for several other countries, maybe four or five,

69
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.940
four or five other Gulf nations to sign deals with Israel.

70
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.750
I thought this is what everybody wanted. You know, it's funny when I,

71
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.230
when I came back on the grid and I did my show with Michael Knowles, uh,

72
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.280
he listed out like the 20 things that I missed. And in a certain respect,

73
00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:12.930
we kind of glossed over, uh, the Israel Arab country,

74
00:04:12.931 --> 00:04:16.200
Gulf country peace agreements here, because it was like,

75
00:04:16.201 --> 00:04:18.870
there was so much going on. And what he said was that, well,

76
00:04:18.871 --> 00:04:21.030
actually the media kind of ignored it.

77
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.050
And that in many ways gets to the heart of what is wrong with so much of what's

78
00:04:25.051 --> 00:04:28.530
going on in the world right now. It's like, if something that we all wanted,

79
00:04:28.531 --> 00:04:31.110
right? Like everybody, I thought the thing that everybody wanted,

80
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.340
the thing that can never happen,

81
00:04:32.341 --> 00:04:36.840
that we all want is that we want peace in the middle East and nobody can do it.

82
00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:39.600
And there's been a million deals they've tried to have,

83
00:04:39.601 --> 00:04:43.890
and they've had agreements and they've had a cords and they've had meetings and

84
00:04:43.891 --> 00:04:47.760
everybody's gone to camp David and they signed things and nothing ever happens.

85
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.010
Uh, but now it actually seems that there's been some sort of realignment in the

86
00:04:53.011 --> 00:04:53.430
middle East.

87
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.260
It seems like there's been some sort of tectonic shift that alliances are

88
00:04:58.261 --> 00:05:03.120
actually changing and maybe the old Wars of the

89
00:05:03.121 --> 00:05:04.470
last century,

90
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:08.400
maybe they won't happen anymore because countries are realizing, Oh,

91
00:05:08.401 --> 00:05:12.660
that little tiny piece of land, the size of New Jersey that has no oil.

92
00:05:12.661 --> 00:05:15.420
Those guys w maybe they're not that all that terrible.

93
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.690
But I thought that was something that we all wanted. And it's like, if you look,

94
00:05:18.691 --> 00:05:21.360
if you just look right now on what the pundits are saying,

95
00:05:21.361 --> 00:05:26.040
it's like either they're ignoring the original deal with the, uh,

96
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.640
UAE in Israel, or they're trying to minimize it. Uh,

97
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.030
but this Norwegian lawmaker who I'm sure is going to have a zillion hit pieces

98
00:05:33.031 --> 00:05:34.800
written about him any day now should be,

99
00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:37.980
by the time I finished speaking the sentence, uh, he feels.

100
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.010
<v 2>Otherwise he went on to say that, uh,</v>

101
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.510
that Trump's key role in facilitating contact between conflicting parties

102
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.130
and creating new dynamics and other protracted conflicts,

103
00:05:49.131 --> 00:05:53.190
such as the cashmere border dispute between India and Pakistan and the conflict

104
00:05:53.191 --> 00:05:54.720
between North and South Korea,

105
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.190
as well as dealing with the nuclear capabilities of North Korea.

106
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.970
<v 1>All basically make Trump worthy of the nomination.</v>

107
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:03.560
Now that does seem legit.

108
00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:08.110
So let's try to remember move partisan politics from this for a second and just

109
00:06:08.111 --> 00:06:11.590
deal with reality. Let's assume for a second,

110
00:06:11.591 --> 00:06:14.740
if we're to believe any of these things that the middle East is shifting a

111
00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:17.200
little more towards peace,

112
00:06:17.201 --> 00:06:20.020
that there doesn't seem to be this feeling that there's going to be suddenly a

113
00:06:20.021 --> 00:06:23.740
war breaking out there. I don't think anyone really feels that. I mean,

114
00:06:23.741 --> 00:06:24.970
there's still some stuff with Iran,

115
00:06:24.971 --> 00:06:27.700
but I don't think anyone really feels there's suddenly going to be a war.

116
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.320
I think part of that is that people don't know what Trump will do now.

117
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.840
His critics would say, Oh, that's because Trump's crazy.

118
00:06:34.841 --> 00:06:37.780
And he's got his finger on the button and the whole world could blow up tomorrow

119
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.430
in world war three. I think it's actually a type of strategy that you go, Oh,

120
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:42.701
you know,

121
00:06:42.701 --> 00:06:46.000
we've got a pretty big army and you don't know what we're going to do with it.

122
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.040
Uh, that used to be called deterrence, right?

123
00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:50.680
That's what you get taught in political science. You have deterrence,

124
00:06:50.681 --> 00:06:54.220
you have a big army. Sometimes you threaten people. Sometimes you don't,

125
00:06:54.221 --> 00:06:58.330
but you keep a little bit of elements of surprise to keep your enemies sorta on

126
00:06:58.331 --> 00:06:59.164
their toes.

127
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.800
So right now it doesn't seem like there's going to be any sort of middle East

128
00:07:02.801 --> 00:07:04.090
war. Um,

129
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.620
he also referenced that North and South Korea seem to be heading a little bit

130
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.620
towards peace. We've seen a little bit of that, right?

131
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.160
We saw the very awkward walk that Trump took with Kim Jong-un. I mean,

132
00:07:15.161 --> 00:07:19.240
we've seen that something decent seems to be happening there. Uh,

133
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.140
the cashmere area between Pakistan and India, uh,

134
00:07:23.141 --> 00:07:24.550
we haven't heard too much about that,

135
00:07:24.551 --> 00:07:26.140
but I don't sense that a war is breaking out.

136
00:07:26.141 --> 00:07:29.680
Like it does seem that the world is shifting a little bit,

137
00:07:29.681 --> 00:07:34.630
maybe the days of giant, you know, ground invasion Wars are ending.

138
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.280
And this will actually get me to the,

139
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.290
to the next story that I'm combining with this one.

140
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.950
So this all seems good, right?

141
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.580
These are all the things that I thought we wanted. Uh,

142
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.970
and if Barack Obama can get a Nobel peace prize for doing nothing,

143
00:07:48.971 --> 00:07:51.850
then it sorta seems to me that, yeah,

144
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.930
Trump is at least worthy of nomination. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this,

145
00:07:55.931 --> 00:07:57.610
though. If, if you disagree with me,

146
00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.950
let me know in the comments right down below.

147
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:04.570
And this actually shifts me to the, to the second part of this story.

148
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:08.860
When I said we had three or four, depending on which way you look at it, uh,

149
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.040
this story is just breaking right now, but Trump has announced,

150
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.690
or it has leaked at least that there is going to be a further troop withdrawal,

151
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:22.060
uh, in Iraq. Now, again, I think this is a good thing, right? What did we want?

152
00:08:22.061 --> 00:08:25.090
We wanted troops out of Iraq. We can debate all day long,

153
00:08:25.091 --> 00:08:28.540
whether you thought the Iraq war was good, we can debate all day long,

154
00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:31.150
whether they were on the path to democracy.

155
00:08:31.151 --> 00:08:33.520
And then we pulled out our troops too soon.

156
00:08:33.521 --> 00:08:37.270
Let's not forget they were having basically free and fair elections.

157
00:08:37.271 --> 00:08:39.760
And then Obama did do what he said he was going to do,

158
00:08:39.761 --> 00:08:42.010
which was just get our troops out quickly.

159
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.610
And then basically the country fell apart again. Then we had the surge, blah,

160
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:49.540
blah, blah, blah. Okay. Uh, it seems to me that at this point,

161
00:08:49.541 --> 00:08:51.610
whether you were for the war, Oregon, to the war,

162
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.950
that we don't need a zillion troops on the ground in Iraq, uh,

163
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.770
it looks like only after this withdrawal, if,

164
00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.380
and this is all sort of happening right now. So some of this stuff could change,

165
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:06.330
but it looks like after this boot draw, we'll only have 5,200 troops Interac.

166
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.810
That seems pretty good. And we, of course you can debate, well,

167
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:11.940
should we have 4,000? Should we have 10,000?

168
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:14.370
Where are they going to be deployed? Are we keeping them in the Gulf?

169
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.050
We can talk about all of those things. But scaling back from these Wars,

170
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.520
I think is what the left used to want, right? Wasn't the left always saying, Oh,

171
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:27.450
it's the conservatives and the Republicans and the neo-cons,

172
00:09:27.451 --> 00:09:30.780
those are the scariest, uh, that are, that want all the war.

173
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.250
And yet Trump is now pulling us back from those Wars. Interestingly,

174
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.560
Tulsi Gabard, who I've had on the show.

175
00:09:37.561 --> 00:09:42.180
Who's a democratic Congresswoman from Hawaii and a veteran she's

176
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:44.400
actively in the military actually. Um,

177
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:49.320
she was completely anti war and she was totally rejected

178
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:54.090
by the democratic establishment, right. She had a lot of underground support.

179
00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:55.320
It was very obvious to me.

180
00:09:55.321 --> 00:09:58.890
She had a lot of underground support during the primaries,

181
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.070
but then in effect, the party just pretty much ignored her.

182
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.710
And even when she hadn't even withdrawn,

183
00:10:04.711 --> 00:10:08.070
they weren't putting in putting her in debates and they did what they do.

184
00:10:08.071 --> 00:10:09.000
We time and again,

185
00:10:09.001 --> 00:10:11.550
when they've screwed Bernie and they've screwed other people where they suddenly

186
00:10:11.551 --> 00:10:15.060
change what the qualifications are to get in debates and the rest of it.

187
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.820
So it's a little hard to tell if you, well, let's put it this way.

188
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.890
If you think that the old idea of Republicans want war and Democrats want

189
00:10:22.891 --> 00:10:26.460
peace, if you think that's the prism that we should be looking at these things,

190
00:10:26.461 --> 00:10:30.120
then you're very confused at the moment because I think most people,

191
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.440
most Americans.

192
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.270
<v 3>Uh, don't want war.</v>

193
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:37.860
<v 1>Would like us to wrap up these things, do it as responsibly as possible,</v>

194
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.250
and then leave the lamb to the people that live there.

195
00:10:41.251 --> 00:10:45.210
So I think that leaving Iraq is good. Oh, wait, let's not forget.

196
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:48.090
He's also getting us out of that Afghanistan thing,

197
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:51.720
which people don't believe this, but the Afghanistan war.

198
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:53.730
<v 3>Which started.</v>

199
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.970
<v 1>Obviously after nine 11, which is it's the,</v>

200
00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.350
what's the 19th anniversary of nine 11, and just two days from now, which is,

201
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:04.290
which is just incredible. And I'll talk a little bit more about that.

202
00:11:04.291 --> 00:11:08.010
I was in New York city, uh, during nine 11. And it was, uh,

203
00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:12.570
that was beyond imagination. I'll talk a little bit more about that tomorrow.

204
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.790
<v 3>Um, but you know, we've.</v>

205
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.480
<v 1>Been in the Afghanistan war for about 18, 19 years.</v>

206
00:11:18.481 --> 00:11:20.790
It's the longest war in American history.

207
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.810
It's hard to really understand that or, or even believe it when you say that,

208
00:11:24.811 --> 00:11:26.760
right? Because it doesn't feel like a war.

209
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.420
Like we don't know really why we're there. We were getting the Taliban out.

210
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.700
<v 3>And what, and then it.</v>

211
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.540
<v 1>Just kind of went on and went on and went on and it went on for Bush and it went</v>

212
00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:41.520
on for Obama. And Trump is trying to scale that back. These are good things.

213
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.260
That's all I'm trying to tell you whether,

214
00:11:43.261 --> 00:11:46.410
whether you like Trump or hate Trump us, you know,

215
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:51.510
I think partly what's happened here is that so many people make their decisions

216
00:11:51.511 --> 00:11:53.830
on whatever Trump thinks. So if you love Trump and you make a decision,

217
00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:56.800
it's automatically good. And if you hate Trump and he makes a decision,

218
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.730
it's automatically bad. You, you can't look at the world like that. You know,

219
00:12:00.731 --> 00:12:04.780
you have to be for something, not just be against someone.

220
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.710
And I think too many people, especially in the media do that.

221
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:13.420
So now you're going to see people sort of jumping through hoops to basically

222
00:12:13.421 --> 00:12:16.810
explain why leaving AraC or Afghanistan is bad.

223
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:20.320
You're going to probably start seeing a lot of that on MSNBC and the

224
00:12:20.321 --> 00:12:23.590
left-leaning places because they can't give Trump credit because what have they

225
00:12:23.591 --> 00:12:27.460
said about the guy the entire time that he's Hitler and you could watch,

226
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.620
I recommend you guys try to find it.

227
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:34.090
There's a video that I did the day after the 2016 election, we were at our,

228
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.880
our old place and we were building the Rubin report studio.

229
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:40.510
So I didn't even have a studio. So I'm, um, I forget if I was using my computer,

230
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:42.850
my laptop or my phone, I think it was off a phone.

231
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.670
And I'm just sitting in the backyard and you can actually hear construction

232
00:12:45.671 --> 00:12:48.370
inside. And one of the things that I kept saying was look,

233
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.190
everyone's surprised Trump is president. Okay.

234
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.010
Even if you were a huge Trump supporter, you were surprised Trump was president.

235
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.980
People are freaking out. They're going crazy. People are young people,

236
00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.890
women screaming. I mean, all hell was breaking loose,

237
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.410
but what you guys could do right now,

238
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.430
and this is what I've tried to get the left to do for,

239
00:13:04.431 --> 00:13:08.680
for a while is a little bit of self-reflection. You might want to go,

240
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:14.260
you know, we've been calling this guy Hitler and his supporters

241
00:13:14.261 --> 00:13:18.070
Nazis, and it's really not what you're doing to them. When you do that,

242
00:13:18.071 --> 00:13:19.360
it's not what you're doing to Trump. It's doing,

243
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.000
it's what you're doing to yourself, because you can never be like, Oh,

244
00:13:22.001 --> 00:13:24.970
that guy I've been calling Hitler and all those Nazis around,

245
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.950
they're actually starting to do good work.

246
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:31.510
And I think that is why the craziness gets ramped up because you can't have

247
00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:34.510
people that for three years were calling him, Hitler suddenly go, Oh,

248
00:13:34.511 --> 00:13:36.490
Hitler's doing good stuff. This,

249
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.910
this is sort of a psychological trap that they're,

250
00:13:39.911 --> 00:13:41.800
that they're locked in at the moment. So anyway,

251
00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.850
I think there's a lot of good stuff happening right here. And,

252
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.510
and we have this sort of get through the brush to understand it.

253
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.720
We are heading towards a place not to say that there will be pure,

254
00:13:52.721 --> 00:13:57.100
perfect middle East peace, but it starts with some economic agreements.

255
00:13:57.101 --> 00:14:00.700
It starts with some travel. It starts with some phone calls.

256
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.930
And the truth is Trump has something to do with some of that stuff.

257
00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:10.060
Getting out of Iraq is good. Getting out of Afghanistan is good. And, uh,

258
00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.210
and we shall see if he wins the Nobel prize.

259
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.220
And speaking of prizes, watch that for a segue. Uh, the Oscars,

260
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:19.360
remember Hollywood,

261
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.050
Hollywood used to be a place where they made things called movies and, uh,

262
00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.780
they made TV shows and other forms of entertainment.

263
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.850
And what they would do is they would generally hire people who were capable of

264
00:14:30.851 --> 00:14:35.110
acting in these movies or writing in these movies and they would then create

265
00:14:35.111 --> 00:14:39.310
something. And then we would go to the movie theater or to, uh,

266
00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.490
turn on our television and we'd watch these forms of entertainment.

267
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:46.870
And perhaps we laugh or we'd cry, or some other emotion would pop up.

268
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.600
And that's what Hollywood was there for. Hollywood is just a business.

269
00:14:49.601 --> 00:14:53.390
People like to think that Hollywood is this sort of, uh,

270
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:57.920
that it's this like obelisk or something, this thing that exists.

271
00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:02.420
And it has this perfect set of rules. And, and that, that is what it is.

272
00:15:02.421 --> 00:15:05.540
But Hollywood is just a business it's in the business of entertainment.

273
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:08.360
And what are businesses? Businesses are trying to make money. Well,

274
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:13.190
unfortunately, Hollywood, which has been one of the prime purveyors of wokeness,

275
00:15:13.191 --> 00:15:17.450
they've decided to go fully stupid woke. And, uh,

276
00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:22.130
now the Oscars are going to have woke points in

277
00:15:22.131 --> 00:15:24.410
effect. Uh, social justice has completely,

278
00:15:24.411 --> 00:15:27.650
if you thought that there was any version of Hollywood that hasn't been corroded

279
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.270
by all of this nonsense.

280
00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:33.040
<v 2>It's here, people it's absolutely here, there are.</v>

281
00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.830
<v 1>Our new Oscar standards, uh,</v>

282
00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.700
to require best pictures to be inclusive.

283
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.340
So we're going to pull up an image here and I'm going to read some of this

284
00:15:42.341 --> 00:15:45.910
stuff. It's, it's just, it's absolutely incredible.

285
00:15:45.911 --> 00:15:47.350
But of course it's not surprising.

286
00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:52.750
<v 2>So standard a, which is about on-screen representation,</v>

287
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:54.670
themes, and narratives now.

288
00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:58.630
<v 1>To achieve a standard, a rating so that you can win.</v>

289
00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:03.520
<v 2>In the Oscar. That means that the film must meet one of the following criteria,</v>

290
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:04.743
a one,

291
00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:09.640
a lead or a significant SU lead or significant supporting

292
00:16:09.641 --> 00:16:10.474
actors.

293
00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:14.320
And what they're talking about here is that means that a leader or a significant

294
00:16:14.321 --> 00:16:15.340
amount of supporting actors,

295
00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:19.660
at least one of the lead actors or significant supporting actors is from an

296
00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:24.550
underrepresented racial or ethnic group. Now this includes Asian.

297
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.100
It includes Hispanic or Latin X.

298
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:31.840
<v 1>By the way, no Latin or Latino person says the phrase,</v>

299
00:16:31.841 --> 00:16:36.340
Latin X. That is something only that social justice warriors forced them to do.

300
00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:37.540
And they don't know why.

301
00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.450
<v 2>And it's very confusing. Usually white lefties.</v>

302
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.750
<v 1>Uh, you've got to have black or African-Americans.</v>

303
00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.550
<v 2>Indigenous slash native American slash Alaskan native middle</v>

304
00:16:48.551 --> 00:16:51.880
Eastern slash North African native, Hawaiian,

305
00:16:51.881 --> 00:16:56.740
or other Pacific Islander or other underrepresented race or

306
00:16:56.741 --> 00:16:57.850
ethnicity. So that's true.

307
00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.620
<v 1>A one. So now first off,</v>

308
00:16:59.621 --> 00:17:02.920
what we're saying is you have to have a certain amount of these types of people

309
00:17:02.921 --> 00:17:06.910
based on the color of their skin or their ethnicity to, uh,

310
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.890
to possibly get that coveted Oscar. Now, this is, uh,

311
00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:16.510
what we would call complete and utter nonsense that if you were doing a movie

312
00:17:16.511 --> 00:17:19.300
about the mafia, let's say, let's say you were doing, I mean,

313
00:17:19.301 --> 00:17:23.500
I could pick any mafia movie, but the, the, to me, the, the best is Goodfellas,

314
00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:27.580
right? So Goodfellas was about the mafia and, uh,

315
00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:32.260
it was about the Italian mafia and it took place in the eighties.

316
00:17:32.261 --> 00:17:34.120
And the Italian mafia had a lot of,

317
00:17:34.121 --> 00:17:37.060
you're not going to believe this Italian people, uh, around them.

318
00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.380
And they were making the gravy and all that good stuff and killing some people.

319
00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:44.200
There happened to be a lot of white people in the film. Uh,

320
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:49.200
they were mostly Italian. Most of the actors were Italian, not all of them, uh,

321
00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:52.920
but there were mostly white people in film. You may remember that. Um,

322
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.460
what's his name? Who's that actor who was a mace Windu who's the actor.

323
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.190
Michael B after mace. Windu what's the,

324
00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:02.430
what the hell is the freaking guy's name? He's a huge actor. What's his name?

325
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:07.020
Frigging Samuel L. Jackson, Jesus come back. Um, Samuel L.

326
00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.890
Jackson was in it for about three minutes. Okay. Now he happens to be black,

327
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.740
but I guess that wouldn't be enough because that would just be one black guy.

328
00:18:13.741 --> 00:18:15.090
He was only in it for a few minutes. Now,

329
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:17.940
putting aside the stupidity of all that you can already see,

330
00:18:17.941 --> 00:18:19.830
everyone knows why this is nonsense.

331
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:25.110
Do you want to judge your actors skills or your writer's skills or

332
00:18:25.111 --> 00:18:29.400
anything else or, or anyone forget your actors or your, your, your writers,

333
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:33.690
anyone, your doctor let's remove the Oscars for just a second.

334
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.260
Let's say you had a heart problem and you're going for heart surgery.

335
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.480
Would you want the best doctor,

336
00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:44.040
or would you want the best doctor who happened to be gay or Latin X

337
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:48.450
or Latin X sounds like a type of mutant or a,

338
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:51.300
or whatever it might be is which would you want.

339
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.250
<v 2>Or, and call me crazy. Would you.</v>

340
00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:59.360
<v 1>Not care about your doctors, gender, or sexuality or skin color?</v>

341
00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.540
And if you were going for heart surgery, you would just say, Hey, can I,

342
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:06.310
can I get the best doctor or do you, are you good at what you do? Could,

343
00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.000
could you do my surgery?

344
00:19:08.001 --> 00:19:12.620
I don't care whether he gets sleep with the dude or not. That's what you want,

345
00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:15.320
but, but they have done this all down and it gets done.

346
00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:19.760
<v 2>Let's just continue, uh, a two. So that was just the rules for a one,</v>

347
00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:23.720
a two are about the general ensemble cast,

348
00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:28.730
at least 30% of all actors in secondary or more

349
00:19:28.731 --> 00:19:33.350
minor roles are from at least two of the following underrepresented groups.

350
00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:38.060
<v 1>Women are women underrepresented in Hollywood. If we took the entire,</v>

351
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:42.110
the entire thing that Hollywood is all of the movies,

352
00:19:42.111 --> 00:19:44.840
all of the TV show it's are women way less underrepresented.

353
00:19:44.841 --> 00:19:46.370
Usually you watch a show. There's some women in it.

354
00:19:46.371 --> 00:19:47.540
There's some men who's counting.

355
00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.710
<v 2>Uh, but you've got to have, uh, racial or ethnic groups,</v>

356
00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:56.330
LGBTQ plus I'm still a little confused what the plus is, uh,

357
00:19:56.360 --> 00:20:00.800
people with cognitive or physical disabilities or who are

358
00:20:00.801 --> 00:20:01.880
deaf or.

359
00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:06.230
<v 1>We're hard of hearing. So I guess kiss off blind people.</v>

360
00:20:06.231 --> 00:20:09.320
You're not on the list, sorry, blind people, but deaf people.

361
00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.680
<v 2>We're going to get a whole bunch of you in there. You hear that, uh,</v>

362
00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.530
a three is that the main.

363
00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:17.420
<v 1>Story or subject matter, and this is of all the stupid ones.</v>

364
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.100
This is peak stupidity, right?

365
00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:20.390
<v 2>Uh,</v>

366
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:25.280
the main storyline theme or narrative of the film should be centered on

367
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:29.420
[inaudible] should be centered on an underrepresented group.

368
00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.960
This includes women racial or ethnic group,

369
00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:38.210
LGBTQ plus people with cognitive or physical disabilities,

370
00:20:38.211 --> 00:20:40.940
or who are deaf or hard of hearing.

371
00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:45.140
<v 1>This is stupidity people. This is absolute stupidity. Oh,</v>

372
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.830
and the best part of all of this, all of these rules,

373
00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:49.900
which apparently are extremely important.

374
00:20:49.901 --> 00:20:53.800
And they're going to end racism and bring the quality, all of this.

375
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:59.610
They're not implying ending until 2024, because you know,

376
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:05.490
you don't have to do a lot of stuff to make sure that the stuff in the can,

377
00:21:05.491 --> 00:21:07.770
that's waiting to come out over the next couple of years, we would,

378
00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:11.280
they have to get rid of all of that old school racist stuff that they're about

379
00:21:11.281 --> 00:21:15.300
to throw on us, all the stuff that's waiting to get on Netflix and on Hulu.

380
00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:19.920
It's, it's just the height of stupidity. It's why social justice,

381
00:21:19.921 --> 00:21:22.140
which sounds sort of right. Again,

382
00:21:22.141 --> 00:21:24.120
if you don't think about all of this and you just hear this,

383
00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:27.990
or we're going to have more gay people and black people and Latin X people and

384
00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.920
deaf people we're, if we're going to have more of these people in everything,

385
00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.810
uh, that things are going to be better, but just,

386
00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.350
just doing it for the sake of those characteristics that are,

387
00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.690
that are meaningless, doesn't make it better.

388
00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:43.120
I will say one other thing before we move on, um, I,

389
00:21:43.121 --> 00:21:47.880
I have a friend who's a extremely well-known sitcom actor or

390
00:21:47.881 --> 00:21:50.820
actress. I'm not going to say whether it's an actor or actress, but has been,

391
00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.700
but it's very famous. And it's been in several shows over decades.

392
00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:58.680
And this person told me that in their last show, which only had a brief stint,

393
00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:02.130
because it did not go well that in the writer's room,

394
00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.630
they in effect decided that they weren't hiring people based on whether they

395
00:22:06.631 --> 00:22:11.160
were funny or not. This person's a comic actor or actress, uh,

396
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:12.930
that they decided they were going to say, Oh, we're going to,

397
00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.810
we have to have one gay person. We have to have one Indian person.

398
00:22:15.811 --> 00:22:19.470
We have to have one black person, one Asian person, et cetera, et cetera.

399
00:22:19.471 --> 00:22:24.000
And that what you got in there was that in effect is not only did you say that

400
00:22:24.001 --> 00:22:27.780
the number one thing to write a comedy show is not to be funny,

401
00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.840
but you get a whole bunch of people who then have all sorts of,

402
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:36.000
they use that identity and then fight over what the storylines will be and

403
00:22:36.001 --> 00:22:38.400
everything else. And the last show that this person did was,

404
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:42.150
was an absolute disaster and miserable for him or her.

405
00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:47.550
So it ruins everything and it ruins every institution it comes in and

406
00:22:47.551 --> 00:22:50.550
it's, it's ruining Hollywood. When's the last time you saw something good.

407
00:22:50.551 --> 00:22:52.920
I mean, all of us right now, we're trapped at home and what happens.

408
00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:55.530
You're on Apple TV, you're on Netflix and it doesn't end.

409
00:22:55.531 --> 00:22:59.610
You can't even find anything worth watching. I'm watching, um, chef's table,

410
00:22:59.611 --> 00:23:01.890
the barbecue edition. That's pretty good actually,

411
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.710
because those people had skills and I don't care whether the guy who's giving me

412
00:23:04.711 --> 00:23:09.420
barbecue is black or white or gay or straight or a lesbian or death. Okay.

413
00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.600
And one story I'm going to do real quick, quick, uh, CNN,

414
00:23:12.601 --> 00:23:15.570
have you heard of that? Uh, former news network? Um,

415
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.900
well they put a, a, they did a little piece,

416
00:23:18.901 --> 00:23:23.040
like an hour long piece on Joe Biden and it was called fight for the white

417
00:23:23.041 --> 00:23:26.250
house, Joe Biden's long journey. And you know,

418
00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.850
the guy has been in politics for 263 years. So it is a long journey.

419
00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:34.410
And one of the things they did, let's throw up the images. They showed image.

420
00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:38.790
Let's show the original image. First, an image.

421
00:23:38.791 --> 00:23:42.000
You can see it right now of Joe Biden with his son.

422
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:47.180
And they're at a Redskins game and his son is wearing a Redskins

423
00:23:47.181 --> 00:23:50.780
hat. Now the Redskins used to be a football team.

424
00:23:50.781 --> 00:23:53.840
You remember football before everyone stopped watching. Uh,

425
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:57.230
but CNN felt that that was too offensive, apparently.

426
00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:02.240
So they edited out the Washington Redskins logo.

427
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:05.990
They didn't mention that they did it. And then they aired the photo this way,

428
00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:11.930
without the deeply offensive red skins logo.

429
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:16.160
Now this story, the reason I wanted to just hit on this real quick,

430
00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:20.630
it's not that important in the scheme of things, right? Middle East peace,

431
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:25.430
perhaps more important, but this type of story,

432
00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:29.750
where a news organization decides to edit out something,

433
00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.740
whether you're for the Redskins, keeping their name or you're against it,

434
00:24:33.741 --> 00:24:35.780
whether you think it's offensive. And usually it's, again,

435
00:24:35.781 --> 00:24:39.470
it's white lefties who are offended by this generally not native Americans,

436
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:43.790
whether you're for it or against it or whatever it is, it existed.

437
00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:47.960
This idea that we can erase history. Let's tear down monuments.

438
00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:51.680
Let's edit out logos on hats. All of these things,

439
00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.980
these are deeply dangerous ideas. They could have shut. Well, first of all,

440
00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:57.050
they didn't have to show the picture at all. So someone,

441
00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:02.030
there was some thought process at CNN where a producer and an AP and an

442
00:25:02.031 --> 00:25:03.980
editor, everybody got together and they said, okay,

443
00:25:03.981 --> 00:25:06.080
this is the picture of Biden. And we want to show it.

444
00:25:06.081 --> 00:25:09.290
Then somebody in the name of social justice said,

445
00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:14.090
we must edit out that picture of the Redskins because they don't exist now

446
00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.210
because we're so tolerant, we've got to get rid of it. And then they just said,

447
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:19.190
we're okay, we're going to do it. We're not going to make, you know,

448
00:25:19.191 --> 00:25:22.670
they could've made a commentary on it. They could've put a little disclaimer,

449
00:25:22.671 --> 00:25:24.440
something, but they do nothing.

450
00:25:24.441 --> 00:25:27.560
And the point of the story and why I wanted to hit on is when they do these

451
00:25:27.561 --> 00:25:29.150
little manipulations,

452
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:33.440
you've got to wonder what the far bigger manipulations are.

453
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:37.250
So I thought it was a story worth, worth noting. I'm sorry.

454
00:25:37.251 --> 00:25:41.360
If we showed you the image and you were, you were deeply, deeply offended.

455
00:25:41.361 --> 00:25:43.670
We should have put a trigger warning before the show.

456
00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:48.350
I will talk to my team about that and I will probably fire at least three

457
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.980
people, preferably white ones. This was the Rubin report.

458
00:25:51.981 --> 00:25:54.110
Direct message for September 9th, 2010.

459
