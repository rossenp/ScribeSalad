00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.390
<v 0>The day started out actually at an MSNBC live taping,</v>

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.450
the taking place a couple blocks away from the Trump rally.

3
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:08.760
And I kind of went there first because I was very nervous about going to the

4
00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:09.594
Trump rally.

5
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.600
And I went there first because it was more of a comfort zone and just started

6
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:15.210
chatting with people. And everyone I told, I was like,

7
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:18.570
I'm thinking about going over the rally. And they were like, don't do it.

8
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.950
They're horrible people.

9
00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:23.160
They're the lowest of the low they're going to harass you.

10
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.790
One woman actually offered me her pepper spray to take with me. And I was like,

11
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:29.430
no, like I'm going to be fine. It'll be okay.

12
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.420
<v 2>Can you just go through a little bit of what your political leanings were</v>

13
00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:42.254
beforehand?

14
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.770
<v 0>Yeah. I've, I've called myself a liberal for like 20 years.</v>

15
00:00:45.771 --> 00:00:47.930
I've been a Democrat since I was 18 years old,

16
00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:50.180
since I was able to register to vote. And frankly,

17
00:00:50.181 --> 00:00:54.410
I never really saw myself leaving the democratic party up until all this started

18
00:00:54.411 --> 00:00:55.244
happening.

19
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.030
<v 2>So then this all happens and you did the scariest, most evil things.</v>

20
00:01:01.031 --> 00:01:02.090
Someone can do.

21
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.010
You went to a Donald J.

22
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.150
Trump rally.

23
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.510
<v 0>I did, but we have to back up a little bit cause it,</v>

24
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.750
it didn't actually start there. It started,

25
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.260
it started several months before the Trump rally and I,

26
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.260
when all this was going on, I basically said, you know,

27
00:01:21.261 --> 00:01:22.730
I need to get out of my echo chamber.

28
00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:24.920
I need to get out of my liberal echo chamber because I,

29
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.460
that was the only people I was hearing from not just liberals by progressives

30
00:01:28.461 --> 00:01:29.294
and all this.

31
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.400
And I made this concerted effort to start listening to voices that I thought

32
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.480
I would disagree with.

33
00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:38.600
And my husband who has always been a little bit more conservative than me said,

34
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.960
Carlin, you should listen to Ben Shapiro. You should watch Ben Shapiro.

35
00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:45.560
You'd like him. And I said, no, Victor, I'm not watching Ben Shapiro.

36
00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:49.490
Ben Shapiro is Satan. And then, I mean,

37
00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:51.920
my husband's a pretty smart guy. So eventually I listened to him.

38
00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:53.210
I waited until he was out of the house.

39
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.590
Cause I didn't want to give him that point.

40
00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:57.860
But eventually I listened and you know, it turns out as you know,

41
00:01:57.861 --> 00:01:59.720
Ben Shapiro is not Satan.

42
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.070
He's just like a conservative guy who is also really funny and really smart.

43
00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:06.200
And I just happened to disagree with him on some things.

44
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.850
And from there it was kind of down the down the YouTube rabbit hole where I just

45
00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:14.480
started listening to all these different people and discovering this

46
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.820
conservatives are really not what I thought they were.

47
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.240
It wasn't the perception that I had and you know, living in New Hampshire,

48
00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:21.021
I'm very lucky.

49
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:24.770
I get to see all the political candidates up close and at one point or another,

50
00:02:24.771 --> 00:02:28.760
I had seen every other political candidate and I thought, you know,

51
00:02:28.761 --> 00:02:30.980
Donald Trump's coming to town. Well, why not?

52
00:02:30.981 --> 00:02:33.350
This is like my big graduation exercise.

53
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.750
<v 2>Yeah. So, all right. So you go to, well, first off, uh,</v>

54
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.640
tell me a little bit more about the,

55
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.500
those sort of what I described as factory settings that you were a liberal for

56
00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:46.280
20 years. Did it,

57
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.750
did it have any real meaning to you or it was just sort of like where I think a

58
00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:53.720
lot of sort of somewhat apolitical people are where it's sort of like,

59
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.010
Oh Democrats, good Republicans, bad Democrats care about poor people,

60
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.610
Republicans care money, like, you know,

61
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:02.440
for the person that's not purely political.

62
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:06.340
It's just sort of the stuff that you kind of get culturally. Uh,

63
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:07.810
is that basically where you were?

64
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.220
<v 0>Yeah, I mean kind of, I,</v>

65
00:03:10.221 --> 00:03:14.130
I think I was very active politically when I was younger and then growing up,

66
00:03:14.131 --> 00:03:17.460
I kind of really, after Obama was elected, I kind of shut it all off.

67
00:03:17.461 --> 00:03:20.970
I was like, okay, he's got it. A Democrats in office, it'll be fine. Uh,

68
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.770
but really what I didn't realize is how much Democrats have changed since you

69
00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:28.350
know, between w and what we have now.

70
00:03:28.351 --> 00:03:30.060
And that was really the big shocker for me,

71
00:03:30.061 --> 00:03:32.610
because I became a Democrat because I didn't like,

72
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.840
I didn't like people telling me what to do.

73
00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:36.450
I didn't like people telling me what music I could listen to or trying to

74
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.900
translate their religion or what I could wear or all these things.

75
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.190
And that was what and who to love as well. And that was why I joined originally.

76
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.570
And it didn't occur to me that the democratic party had changed so much from the

77
00:03:48.571 --> 00:03:49.404
thing I joined.

78
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.010
<v 2>I have heard this story before.</v>

79
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.640
What did you think intuitively about the Republicans?

80
00:03:55.641 --> 00:03:59.700
So you thought they wanted to tell you what music you could listen to and what

81
00:03:59.701 --> 00:04:00.630
video games you could play.

82
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.390
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, there,</v>

83
00:04:03.391 --> 00:04:07.110
there are horrible evil people that just wanted to control everything I sat and

84
00:04:07.111 --> 00:04:09.120
did was my perception of the Republicans.

85
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.850
<v 2>Okay. So then Trump comes to New Hampshire and there you are.</v>

86
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.250
<v 0>There I am.</v>

87
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.890
So the day started out actually at an MSNBC live taping that taking

88
00:04:22.891 --> 00:04:25.170
place a couple blocks away from the Trump rally.

89
00:04:25.171 --> 00:04:27.480
And I kind of went there first because I was very nervous about going to the

90
00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:28.314
Trump rally.

91
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.320
And I went there first because it was more of a comfort zone and just started

92
00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:33.930
chatting with people. And everyone I told, I was like,

93
00:04:33.931 --> 00:04:37.290
I'm thinking about going over the rally. And they were like, don't do it.

94
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.700
They're horrible people.

95
00:04:38.701 --> 00:04:41.910
They're the lowest of the low they're going to harass you.

96
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.510
One woman actually offered me her pepper spray to take with me. And I was like,

97
00:04:45.511 --> 00:04:48.150
no, like, I'm going to be fine. It'll be okay.

98
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.520
And so then I went over to the rally and you know,

99
00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:53.310
you have to get there early because the line is really big and long,

100
00:04:53.311 --> 00:04:56.760
and you're just kind of hanging out and chatting with people and discovered

101
00:04:56.761 --> 00:05:00.330
there, these are not bad people. There was not a Klan uniform in sight.

102
00:05:00.331 --> 00:05:02.580
I didn't meet a Nazi that I am aware of.

103
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.970
There's normal everyday people like veterans and school teachers and small

104
00:05:05.971 --> 00:05:10.710
business owners that just had different ideas about how the country should run.

105
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.910
<v 2>How shocked were you? I mean, it sounds obvious, right?</v>

106
00:05:14.911 --> 00:05:16.950
The way you're saying it now, it's like, of course it's obvious.

107
00:05:16.951 --> 00:05:19.950
These are regular people. They just happen to have different, uh,

108
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.190
political thoughts than what is sort of more mainstream accepted.

109
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.440
But for you as someone that wasn't part of this bubble,

110
00:05:25.441 --> 00:05:27.690
you get there and you start seeing this, like, were,

111
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.130
were you just like completely blown away?

112
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.340
<v 0>I think I was more relieved than anything. Honestly, I, I think I was just like,</v>

113
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.241
Oh my God,

114
00:05:36.241 --> 00:05:39.870
these are people that I can have a conversation with because that's something

115
00:05:39.871 --> 00:05:44.550
that is very void in, in the democratic spaces. You have to agree with everyone.

116
00:05:44.551 --> 00:05:46.800
And if you don't agree with them, you're a horrible person.

117
00:05:46.801 --> 00:05:50.700
And so I had for a long time, kept some of my I've always been a centrist.

118
00:05:50.701 --> 00:05:51.331
Really. I'm not,

119
00:05:51.331 --> 00:05:55.440
I've never been terribly far left and I'd always kept my views to myself.

120
00:05:55.441 --> 00:05:59.420
Whereas like these people, I having robust conversations with them even in line.

121
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:02.930
And I let it slip a couple of times, you know, I'm, I'm a Democrat.

122
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.320
And they were like, Oh my God, welcome you. We're so glad you're here.

123
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.900
And that was very different than what I was expecting.

124
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.680
<v 2>Yeah. I know the feeling.</v>

125
00:06:11.681 --> 00:06:15.760
So then you go and you hear Trump talk and okay.

126
00:06:15.761 --> 00:06:19.150
There's some agree to disagree stuff. No Nazis is all good.

127
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.810
You decide to write about it. How'd that work?

128
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.200
<v 0>I did. Well, I almost didn't even write the article to be honest.</v>

129
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.650
Cause I was like, I, this is not my lane. I don't want to talk about politics.

130
00:06:29.651 --> 00:06:32.230
I'm going to get in trouble. I'm going to make someone mad, whatever.

131
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.590
But then I sat down at my desk the next day and I just,

132
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.410
I had to get the ball like out of my system.

133
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.770
And so I went on to medium cause I was like, I don't really use medium.

134
00:06:41.771 --> 00:06:43.480
I hadn't published there in over a year. It was like,

135
00:06:43.481 --> 00:06:44.920
no one's ever going to see this.

136
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.390
And so I wrote the whole article about that surprise. Um,

137
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.590
I wrote it in about 20 minutes and didn't even proofread it before I posted it

138
00:06:53.591 --> 00:06:56.890
and just threw it up and kind of posted it on a couple of like Twitter and

139
00:06:56.891 --> 00:07:00.580
Facebook and all that, and really thought nothing of it after that.

140
00:07:00.581 --> 00:07:02.680
And it got about 200 views the first day.

141
00:07:02.681 --> 00:07:06.460
And then the next day it was like a bomb went off on my life.

142
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.500
Yeah.

143
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.220
<v 2>So what, okay, so you put it up, you're not really expecting much of anything.</v>

144
00:07:12.221 --> 00:07:15.400
And then, you know, you just can't control the viral nature of these things.

145
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.160
Do you know where the energy behind it started?

146
00:07:18.161 --> 00:07:21.010
Was there a specific person that caught it that set it on fire?

147
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.420
<v 0>I still haven't been able to figure that out. Honestly,</v>

148
00:07:25.421 --> 00:07:27.820
it started going viral in the morning. Um,

149
00:07:27.821 --> 00:07:31.390
and then I know a whole bunch of people from Fox news tweeted it and Glenn Beck

150
00:07:31.391 --> 00:07:34.990
tweeted it. And at some point in the afternoon, Trump Jr tweeted it.

151
00:07:34.991 --> 00:07:38.950
And that was when it all really started going out of hand. Um, but I mean,

152
00:07:38.951 --> 00:07:41.980
it just I'm, I haven't been able to pinpoint what exactly happened.

153
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.620
<v 2>Okay. So the thing goes viral.</v>

154
00:07:44.621 --> 00:07:49.270
You're getting support from people that maybe you traditionally wouldn't have

155
00:07:49.271 --> 00:07:52.510
thought would have supported you, the president son. I mean, this is,

156
00:07:52.511 --> 00:07:55.720
this is getting weird. What kind of reaction did you get?

157
00:07:55.721 --> 00:07:58.210
And basically why don't you just lay out a little bit more what you said in the

158
00:07:58.211 --> 00:07:59.800
article? I mean, it's sort of what you've laid out here,

159
00:07:59.801 --> 00:08:03.130
but maybe a little more specifically so that when we talk about the reaction,

160
00:08:03.131 --> 00:08:04.510
it'll be a little better framed.

161
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.430
<v 0>Yeah. So basically what I said in the article was that, you know,</v>

162
00:08:09.431 --> 00:08:12.940
we need to start taking steps towards one another and to start healing the

163
00:08:12.941 --> 00:08:14.140
political divides. And that,

164
00:08:14.141 --> 00:08:17.620
that I think was the big message I wanted people to take away from it is that

165
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.230
Trump supporters are not bad people. And you know,

166
00:08:20.231 --> 00:08:23.560
hopefully a liberal writing this article, if Trump's supporters think that,

167
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.140
you know, I'm a bad person, they're going to see that, you know, someone,

168
00:08:26.141 --> 00:08:27.070
someone has your back.

169
00:08:27.071 --> 00:08:30.760
And I think that that was what a lot of Trump's supporters really appreciated

170
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:34.060
about. It was there was this person coming and saying, you know,

171
00:08:34.061 --> 00:08:36.070
you're not a Nazi. I know you're not a Nazi.

172
00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:40.540
We just have different ideas and let's talk about those ideas. And um,

173
00:08:40.541 --> 00:08:43.810
so yeah, and then it was off and running and the response from the,

174
00:08:43.811 --> 00:08:45.940
the Trump supporters or the conservative community,

175
00:08:45.941 --> 00:08:49.840
and those are not always the same thing I've discovered. Um, it's,

176
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.910
it's been amazing, right? They, they really, they,

177
00:08:52.911 --> 00:08:57.420
they embraced me and they was so many of them said, you know, um,

178
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.090
I don't agree with you on a lot of political issues,

179
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:01.410
but I'm so glad you wrote this.

180
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:04.650
I'm so glad you're speaking your mind and let's have those conversations.

181
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.360
And a lot of them too, I mean,

182
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:10.350
I was overwhelmed with the amount of notes I got from people saying, um,

183
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.510
you know, my husband is a Republican Democrat.

184
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.270
I don't know how to make our marriage survive war, you know,

185
00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:18.140
people who have lost family members over this. And I,

186
00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:22.200
so a lot of people really appreciated that. I think they saw in me,

187
00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:23.370
someone that said, you know,

188
00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:26.280
it's possible to get over your Trump derangement syndrome.

189
00:09:26.281 --> 00:09:27.780
And that gave a lot of people hope.

190
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.170
<v 2>Yeah. And then, you know,</v>

191
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.500
you find yourself on the other side of this and then suddenly all the people

192
00:09:33.501 --> 00:09:34.370
that you might've thought were bad,

193
00:09:34.371 --> 00:09:38.170
guys are being nice to you and agreeing to disagree. And the rest of it, there,

194
00:09:38.171 --> 00:09:41.390
there's a moment there where you have to kind of be like, Oh, was I,

195
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.630
was I really wrong? You have to do a little self reflection. Right?

196
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:50.240
<v 0>Yeah. And I've been actually pretty transparent since then that I, you know,</v>

197
00:09:50.241 --> 00:09:53.810
Trump derangement syndrome is a real thing. I had it for years. I,

198
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.980
I regret so many of the things that I've said to people over the last couple of

199
00:09:57.981 --> 00:09:59.930
years now that I've seen the other side of it.

200
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.740
