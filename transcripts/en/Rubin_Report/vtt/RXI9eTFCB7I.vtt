1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.340
<v 0>But I think that what you're saying right now, this, this, this race war that,</v>

2
00:00:04.341 --> 00:00:08.100
that the left is, is fully behind it and really wants to happen.

3
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:09.930
And all of this idea of race and all this stuff,

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.310
you have to understand that these people are freaking out.

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.040
They are terrified that black Americans are really starting to see

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.520
pass their game. When you look at a millennial like me, um,

7
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.930
I have lived through a little bit of this and,

8
00:00:25.931 --> 00:00:28.950
and I used to be on the left and I've made no bones about that,

9
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.000
but it just gets to the point where you've seen this all before.

10
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.190
<v 1>Remember all the way back when to like February,</v>

11
00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:43.520
when we were pre pandemic and we were having those democratic debates,

12
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:44.354
do you remember.

13
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.130
<v 0>Oh my God, it seems like a million years ago at this point. So.</v>

14
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.570
<v 1>There was one of the debates when the Democrats were all going on and on Bernie</v>

15
00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:57.600
and Elizabeth and the whole crew about how racist America was. And,

16
00:00:57.601 --> 00:01:01.610
and I tweeted out something to the effect of, I said, you know, I think it's,

17
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.780
it sounds crazy,

18
00:01:02.781 --> 00:01:06.680
but Trump's going to get 30% of the black vote and they know it.

19
00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:09.230
And that's why they're freaking out. Because before the pandemic,

20
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.960
we know that black unemployment was at an all time low.

21
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.130
There was that crazy moment at the state of the union where he actually,

22
00:01:16.131 --> 00:01:17.510
Trump actually says that,

23
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.480
and you watch the members of the congressional black caucus.

24
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.140
Sit there like this as if, as if this is a problem.

25
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:27.170
I thought that's why they have their caucus because we want people to be

26
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:29.390
prosperous and all that. Um,

27
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.430
then we have now these months of, of race stuff,

28
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.760
um, what, what do you think is gonna happen?

29
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.770
Which way do you think the black vote is going to break at the end

30
00:01:42.771 --> 00:01:43.604
of all of this?

31
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.160
<v 0>Well, look, I think that pre pandemic, honestly, things were going so well for,</v>

32
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.130
for everybody. Um, if you would have asked me that question, pre-plant pandemic,

33
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.420
I would have said, Oh yeah, you know, 30, 40%, whatever, you know,

34
00:01:56.421 --> 00:01:59.510
that that was probably a little high even before pre pandemic.

35
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.190
But I think that what you're saying right now, this, this, this race war that,

36
00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:07.940
that the left is, is fully behind it and really wants to happen.

37
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:09.770
And all of this idea of race and all this stuff,

38
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.150
you have to understand that these people are freaking out.

39
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.910
They are terrified that black Americans are really starting to see

40
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.390
past their game. When you look at a millennial like me, um,

41
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.780
I have lived through a little bit of this and,

42
00:02:25.781 --> 00:02:28.820
and I used to be on the left and I've made no bones about that,

43
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.870
but it just gets to the point where you've seen this all before.

44
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.440
So you've seen this story play out over and over and over again.

45
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.050
So you get to the point where you're like me and your post 30,

46
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.200
and you're just looking at this stuff. And then you start saying, wait a minute.

47
00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:44.810
And you start thinking differently. And then you,

48
00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:49.070
you amass a platform where people actually start listening to your thoughts.

49
00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:52.220
And there are people like me and, and God, there's so many people out there.

50
00:02:52.221 --> 00:02:54.110
There's the, the me and the Candace and Brandon Tatum,

51
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.930
but there's more than I can count right now, which is great,

52
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.950
which is a good thing.

53
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.980
And that week's the left out because they can only

54
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:04.050
control the,

55
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.620
the black people that they fostered into positions of power and in their sort of

56
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:13.480
media, uh, control groups, right? So the CNNs and the MSNBC's of the world,

57
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.900
but there's a lot of conversation that is happening with us.

58
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.170
And I will tell you, I'm Dave, my social media,

59
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:24.640
when all of these riots and all of this stuff started happening exploded.

60
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.920
And when I tell you the following in all platforms is completely exploded and

61
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:32.890
it tells me that people are hungry for different perspective.

62
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.970
So back to the black vote, I think we're looking at somewhere between,

63
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.910
and to be completely honest and a hundred percent rail.

64
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.610
I think we're looking at somewhere between 12 and 15%.

65
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.980
And even if we get to 12%, that's a 33% jump from,

66
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
from 2016. And if you get to 15 and 16%,

67
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.810
that is double all right, what he did. And in 2016,

68
00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.730
and Democrats can not win national elections without

69
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.870
upwards of 90% of the African-American vote. They know this,

70
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:09.400
this is why they did not win in 2016 because black people just stay at home

71
00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:12.580
because they didn't want to vote for Hillary because of a lot of different

72
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:15.970
reasons. And yet they do the same thing. They tried out a,

73
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:18.280
another deeply unpopular,

74
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.440
super establishment candidate that's been around for forever and

75
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:25.150
say that this is going to be our change candidates.

76
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:28.090
So they make these same mistakes over and over and over again,

77
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.110
the guy who's going to change all of the systemic racism is the guy that was in

78
00:04:34.111 --> 00:04:36.990
the Senate for like 30 years and was vice president for eight years.

79
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.650
This time he's going to do it right. It's incredible. Yeah.

80
00:04:40.651 --> 00:04:43.680
This time is going to do the right. And it's the same guy that didn't want, um,

81
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.760
integration in schools because he said that it would turn schools into a quote

82
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.240
racial jungle. Yes. Joe Biden said that. Look it up.

83
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.120
Yeah. What a, what a weird thing do you,

84
00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:58.470
do you sense the gays are gonna have a similar crack? The gays,

85
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.320
Oh, the gays, the gays, the gays. Um, I,

86
00:05:03.321 --> 00:05:07.740
I try my best with the gays. I honestly really don't know. I, you can.

87
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.490
Okay.

88
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.260
So you can only judge by the following that you get and you can judge by the

89
00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:16.110
DMS and the emails and stuff that I get.

90
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.720
But also I I'm in Florida right now.

91
00:05:18.721 --> 00:05:22.680
The gays are generally generally more conservative leaning.

92
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.900
I think that there is a subset and there always has been of gays and lesbians

93
00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:30.520
that are working and law abiding citizens.

94
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.200
And they look at some of this stuff and it, it just doesn't jive with, you know,

95
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.500
uh, and I hope, and I pray that the gays wake up.

96
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.880
I think that a lot of them privately are not into the cult stuff.

97
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.590
I think that a lot of them privately either don't vote for liberals

98
00:05:46.591 --> 00:05:50.760
or possibly even vote for Republicans, possibly even vote for Trump,

99
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.920
but they would never dare say it because they would never want to be.

100
00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:59.450
Ex-communicated, like I said, it was, which is what happened to you. And I.

101
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.000
<v 1>W I think we talked about this last time, but I honestly can't remember the,</v>

102
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:06.190
the closet thing, you know,

103
00:06:06.191 --> 00:06:10.510
coming out as a gay person versus coming out as conservative or on the right.

104
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.830
Or, or basically anything non woke at this point. Um, which,

105
00:06:14.831 --> 00:06:15.880
which was harder for you.

106
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.580
<v 0>It was. So when you come out as gay nowadays, right. You know, you,</v>

107
00:06:21.581 --> 00:06:24.910
everybody loves it and it's so accepting and, and it's all good. And it's,

108
00:06:24.911 --> 00:06:27.040
whatever coming out is conservative.

109
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.030
It was one of the most disruptive life events I've ever had in my life.

110
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.250
And you're talking about somebody that you're talking to,

111
00:06:33.251 --> 00:06:36.880
somebody that's been to war, right. So coming out as conservative,

112
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.460
literally literally been to war.

113
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.670
So command conservative was such a disruptive life event.

114
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.200
And I talk about this a little bit, um, losing all your friends,

115
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.100
um, having youth, some family members say, what, what are you doing?

116
00:06:51.101 --> 00:06:55.540
People that were at my wedding no longer talk to me.

117
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.470
All right. Um, the, the best man at my wedding, no longer talk to me.

118
00:06:59.471 --> 00:07:02.560
So it's just, it's a very disruptive event.

119
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.260
So if I had to say which one was harder for me,

120
00:07:05.261 --> 00:07:08.680
it was coming out as conservative because you coming out as gay people have just

121
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.160
like, Oh, okay, well, you know, sometimes there's a problem with that. Um,

122
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.540
most times there's not in 2020, but when you come out as a conservative, this,

123
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.750
this stigma that is thrown on your shoulders is that you are,

124
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.200
you are basically Hitler.

125
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.430
You are basically supporting the worst, most racist,

126
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:32.380
xenophobic, homophobic the, the worst of humanity as,

127
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.890
as I was called on social media. Um,

128
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.810
and so that is very disruptive and you have to have a very strong sense

129
00:07:40.811 --> 00:07:43.060
of self to come out of it. On the other side.

130
00:07:43.061 --> 00:07:46.810
That's why so openly share my story that people get fired from their jobs.

131
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.630
People. I, it was the most heartbreaking thing. Um,

132
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:54.370
one of my followers on Facebook reached out to me and her two

133
00:07:54.371 --> 00:07:59.080
grown adult children called her a racist Nazi and

134
00:07:59.081 --> 00:08:01.300
completely cut her out of their lives.

135
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:06.100
And those stories make me so sad if you're looking for more.
