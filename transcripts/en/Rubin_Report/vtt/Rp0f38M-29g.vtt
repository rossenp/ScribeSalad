1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.280
<v 0>And this is so unfortunate.</v>

2
00:00:01.281 --> 00:00:05.580
It makes me so sad is that these kids are going to be changing their minds in a

3
00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:09.390
few years, I say five to 10 years. So we're what is this?

4
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.880
This is going to be August, 2020 when this comes out.

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.110
So give it five to 10 years. They're going to be so many kids who are saying,

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.260
why did my parents let me do this? Why did mental health,

7
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.060
why did medical professionals let me do this?

8
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.430
They are going to have issues from being on hormonal treatments from surgery.

9
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.650
I'm already seeing all of these young people,

10
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:30.570
these D transitioners and it really breaks my heart.

11
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:33.870
And no one is listening to them and no one is taking them seriously. And it's,

12
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.850
there are going to be tons of class action lawsuits.

13
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.750
<v 1>The title, the end of gender. Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:45.230
I thought it was kind of interesting because it's like, you're,

15
00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:49.640
you're dealing with and unpacking all of these seriously complex issues

16
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.180
related to identity and gender and everything else,

17
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.370
but you're calling it the end of gender.

18
00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:59.630
Do you think that what we're left with at the end of this

19
00:00:59.631 --> 00:01:02.300
conversation, if we can truly have it honestly,

20
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.770
is that gender won't matter? Won't exist?

21
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.120
What do you mean by the end?

22
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.420
<v 0>Yeah, let me clarify. Because when I announced this,</v>

23
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.520
when I noticed the announced the book on social media,

24
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.840
people got upset at me because they thought I was saying that this is like the

25
00:01:17.841 --> 00:01:21.440
very super woke, far left end of gender.

26
00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:23.060
And that gender doesn't exist anymore,

27
00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:25.790
or that gender is completely what you want it to be.

28
00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:30.170
And it's based in self-identification and there was no tethering to biology or

29
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.750
objectivity, and that's not at all what I'm saying.

30
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.130
And I really want to emphasize I'm actually.

31
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.463
<v 1>The complete.</v>

32
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.760
<v 0>Opposite of that.</v>

33
00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:42.350
I'm saying gender is very much biologically based and it is

34
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.300
the misinformation and denial of science and denial of biology and denial of

35
00:01:47.301 --> 00:01:51.650
evolutionary psychology that is leading us to not have a proper understanding of

36
00:01:51.651 --> 00:01:54.110
gender. And that's why I see it's demise.

37
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.030
<v 1>Yeah. So, so paint the picture that turns some of this around,</v>

38
00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:02.000
besides just some people getting braver,

39
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:06.560
like the political part of this event. I mean, when you see at this point,

40
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.480
all of these, you know, the LGBT organizations, uh, that at this point,

41
00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:15.440
I think are just basically using gay people to now push the gender stuff.

42
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.940
I mean, what,

43
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.290
what has to happen to them or are there non-profits that are fighting this from

44
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.730
a correct scientific perspective? Like what has to happen now? Really.

45
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.030
<v 0>What I see happening,</v>

46
00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:32.990
and I actually have a line in the book where I say I'm appalled and I love,

47
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.480
I love the gay community and I have many gay men.

48
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:38.330
Who've reached out to me over the years, complete strangers who say to me,

49
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:41.930
thank you for saying what you did because I was one of these children.

50
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.550
I actually had one individual reach out to me.

51
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.220
Tell me around this around the time my first op-ed came out, he said,

52
00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:49.400
I was thinking of transitioning and I read your op-ed and I decided to wait.

53
00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:53.450
And I'm so glad I did. So there is a line in the book where I say,

54
00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:57.350
I'm appalled that the number of gay men who are in support of transitioning

55
00:02:57.351 --> 00:03:00.280
children, because this is leading to the extermination of gay kids.

56
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.110
And what I really think is going to happen.

57
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:06.160
And this is so unfortunate and it makes me so sad is that these kids are going

58
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:09.700
to be changing their minds in a few years, I say five to 10 years.

59
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.870
So we're what is this? This is going to be August, 2020 when this comes out.

60
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.130
So give it five to 10 years. They're going to be so many kids who are saying,

61
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.280
why did my parents let me do this? Why did mental health,

62
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.080
why did medical professionals let me do this?

63
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.450
They are going to have issues from being on hormonal treatments from surgery.

64
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.570
I'm already seeing all of these young people, these deep transitioners,

65
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:32.590
and it really breaks my heart.

66
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:35.890
And no one is listening to them and no one is taking them seriously. And it's,

67
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.870
there are going to be tons of class action lawsuits.

68
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.250
And I already see good clinicians in the field who are concerned because they

69
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:43.820
know it's coming and,

70
00:03:43.821 --> 00:03:48.430
and they feel at a loss because we've been trying to raise attention and get

71
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:50.740
people to take us seriously, but they just call us transphobic.

72
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.500
<v 1>Right? And by the way,</v>

73
00:03:52.501 --> 00:03:55.920
it's not just the personal issues and the medical issues and everything else.

74
00:03:55.921 --> 00:03:59.280
There's going to be an insane amount of legal issues that pop up there.

75
00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:01.470
I think there's going to be kids. You know, they'll,

76
00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:03.870
there'll be young adults at the time that are going to start suing their

77
00:04:03.871 --> 00:04:04.291
parents.

78
00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:08.160
I think they're going to start suing the doctors and probably everybody else

79
00:04:08.161 --> 00:04:10.680
involved. I'm sure there were lawyers looking at that right now.

80
00:04:10.681 --> 00:04:11.514
There's got to be right.

81
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.250
<v 0>And I would say to your audience too,</v>

82
00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:17.310
because I'm sure they have been following the, these issues as well,

83
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.050
pay attention to the people who are most loudly and proudly embracing this and

84
00:04:22.051 --> 00:04:24.480
saying, this is great for the kids. Because when this time comes,

85
00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:27.660
they're going to turn around and say, we had no idea this was going to happen.

86
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.840
And they're going to pretend that they had no idea when they are coming after

87
00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:32.220
those of us who are speaking out about it.

88
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.850
<v 1>I know it's a little weird to be ahead of the curve. Isn't it?</v>

89
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.490
Cause you kind of feel like you're behind it sometimes as,

90
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.080
as the things start to come true.

91
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.070
<v 0>I feel the odd thing. And when I was writing this book, I felt the whole time,</v>

92
00:04:44.071 --> 00:04:47.730
it was a very emotional process for me because it felt very much like those of

93
00:04:47.731 --> 00:04:48.361
us who see it,

94
00:04:48.361 --> 00:04:51.600
it's like we're able to see the future and we're just trying to scream as loud

95
00:04:51.601 --> 00:04:53.670
as possible to get people to pay attention.

96
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.930
<v 1>Uh don't I know it. I know it, uh, you just mentioned the deep,</v>

97
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.820
the D transitioning part of this. Is there a lot of literature is there,

98
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.990
or a lot of research on that as far as how many people have done it,

99
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.250
are they happier after? Are they suicidal after? I mean,

100
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.840
what are the numbers look like on that?

101
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.060
<v 0>There was one study in Sweden that looked at people who had</v>

102
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.180
transitioned and then Tran changed the,

103
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.780
the marker on their legal documentation and then changed it back.

104
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.460
And they found that about 2% of people who had transitioned changed back.

105
00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:32.640
But the thing is not everyone who transitions does it legally.

106
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.140
And also the data collected for that study. It finished around 2011.

107
00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:41.970
I think it was. So that was before this huge influx we see of young people,

108
00:05:41.971 --> 00:05:46.770
especially young women identifying as male. Um, and I've written quite a bit.

109
00:05:46.771 --> 00:05:49.140
And in the book I talk about rapid onset gender dysphoria,

110
00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:53.700
which is this phenomenon of young women who are very quickly identifying as

111
00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:56.520
male, wanting to transition to male, taking testosterone, again,

112
00:05:56.521 --> 00:06:01.280
getting double mastectomy, um, when they were very gender typical as children,

113
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.990
it's usually very out of the blue.

114
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:07.160
Usually they have other mental health issues like autism. For a lot of them,

115
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:09.260
they have sexual trauma. That's not being talked about.

116
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.830
And so we don't yet have the data for that.

117
00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:14.090
We don't know what that's going to look like.

118
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.770
Although there is one County in the UK where hundreds of Dee

119
00:06:18.771 --> 00:06:23.000
transitioners are coming out and saying, I'm I have autism I'm lesbian.

120
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.920
And why didn't people, why didn't, why didn't professionals, you know,

121
00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:30.620
do what they should have done, which is ask me questions.

122
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.340
<v 1>Yeah. I can't imagine discussing anything almost more controversial than that.</v>

123
00:06:36.341 --> 00:06:39.850
You couple this sort of rapid transition with autism,

124
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.500
and then you get people to try to talk about that. It's like, no, one's good.

125
00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.070
You could see why the average, uh, researcher just would just be like,

126
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.510
no way I'm not doing this.

127
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.380
<v 0>No. And it's difficult enough to get a study published.</v>

128
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.570
You have to get funding for your, I mean, the book,

129
00:06:55.571 --> 00:07:00.370
I talk about a number of situations where researchers have gotten approval and

130
00:07:00.371 --> 00:07:03.310
they've gotten money to do their study and still they have to deal with all

131
00:07:03.311 --> 00:07:06.550
these extra roadblocks that pop up where people coming after them and

132
00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:08.700
threatening them. So at the end of the day, you know,

133
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.020
the science is taking a very unfortunate turn.

134
00:07:11.021 --> 00:07:13.420
I think we're going to look back on this period with,

135
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.300
with a lot of horror and disappointment,

136
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.910
but I'm hoping that the,

137
00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.350
the outcome is not going to be that terrible if we start speaking out about it.

138
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:24.610
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

139
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:29.380
Have they done real research on the social pressures related to all of this?

140
00:07:29.381 --> 00:07:33.400
So like when you mentioned the rapid onset where suddenly a whole bunch of girls

141
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:38.650
that otherwise, like, it sort of appears out of nowhere in essence, um,

142
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.360
that could it be from a peer group and then they're really doing these things

143
00:07:43.361 --> 00:07:47.680
that are just really just crazily extreme to fit in,

144
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:48.723
in essence.

145
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.830
<v 0>Yeah. So this,</v>

146
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.460
the one study that's been done in rapid onset gender dysphoria to date was

147
00:07:54.461 --> 00:07:56.350
published in 2018 by Lisa Littman.

148
00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:01.330
And she did the research did suggest that there's a peer contagion aspect to it

149
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:02.711
and that these girls.

150
00:08:02.711 --> 00:08:07.210
So for 40% of the girls in the study who had come out as trans very quickly,

151
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.280
they had at least half of their group,

152
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.160
their friend group also identify as transgender,

153
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.660
which is 70 times the rate of what you would see in the general population in

154
00:08:16.661 --> 00:08:18.610
terms of people who identify as transgender.

155
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.600
So that in itself should raise a red flag in most people's minds.

156
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:26.350
