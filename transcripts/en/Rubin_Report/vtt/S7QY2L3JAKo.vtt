00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.660
<v 0>The difference between me and Hunter Biden is I did that through the business</v>

2
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:05.780
that he built up as a capitalist. You know,

3
00:00:05.781 --> 00:00:08.100
if he wanted to give me a billion dollars, I could put it on a pile of floor,

4
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:10.020
light it on fire. And that's our prerogative. I mean,

5
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:11.820
that's sort of the differences.

6
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.050
I didn't do it through my daddy's taxpayer funded office.

7
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.980
<v 1>It seems to me that if Donald Trump Jr was getting about 85 grand a month to</v>

8
00:00:24.981 --> 00:00:27.440
work for a company in a foreign land,

9
00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:30.350
who he didn't have any expertise in doing what they do at LA.

10
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.150
<v 0>And which I didn't speak in a business, I know nothing about,</v>

11
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.610
I think you see where I'm going with this. I mean,

12
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.090
that's the hypocrisy and the media we're talking about Hunter Biden.

13
00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:42.800
Of course the media loves to do this. They go, Oh, Donald Trump Jr.

14
00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:46.400
Attacked Hunter Biden. I go, yeah, well, daughter was from Jr.

15
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.830
He's so not self-aware. I was like, no, no, no, I get it.

16
00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:49.700
I'm the son of a rich guy.

17
00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:52.140
I've gotten a big part where I set it on Hannity a couple of times.

18
00:00:52.141 --> 00:00:55.220
And then I didn't, you know, give the three minute disclaimer,

19
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.010
the second time I was on. So they were like, Oh, he doesn't get that.

20
00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:01.250
He's also benefited. I go, no, no, I've benefited from my father's last name.

21
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.220
I share his name. I get that. I'm not pretending that it hasn't happened,

22
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.260
but also aren't you proud of that? I mean, a hundred percent,

23
00:01:06.261 --> 00:01:08.240
we have this fear of success here, but Dave,

24
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.840
the difference between me and Hunter Biden is I did that through the business

25
00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:13.960
that he built up as a capitalist. You know,

26
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:16.310
if he wanted to give me a billion dollars, I could put it on a pilot floor,

27
00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:18.230
light it on fire. And that's our prerogative. I mean,

28
00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:22.850
that's sort of know the difference is I didn't do it through my daddy's tax

29
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.150
payer funded office. Right. Uh, you know,

30
00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:28.850
it magically become an international businessman. When we won,

31
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.980
before he even took the presidency, we said,

32
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.100
we're not going to do new foreign deals. And we had deals that, you know,

33
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.900
buildings we're building and we can't just pull out.

34
00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:38.450
We have a contractual obligation. We said we will not.

35
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.530
That was a big part of my business.

36
00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:42.200
That's why I'm so involved in politics because that's what I did. I got,

37
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.360
I have a lot more free time now. So it was like, Hey,

38
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:46.370
I'll get involved in this and fight for what I believe in.

39
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.060
It's why I wrote a book, but the false equivalency of being like, well,

40
00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:53.810
how are you different than Hunter Biden? How am I different? Like we start,

41
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.260
I was an international businessman for the last 15 years. Okay.

42
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.060
We stopped doing those deals just so they could have no, you know,

43
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.260
impropriety story,

44
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.000
Hunter Biden magically becomes an international businessmen, you know,

45
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.000
gets on a board of an energy company. He knows nothing about energy,

46
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:14.540
had no track record and is making $83,000 a month in the Ukraine where his

47
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.750
father is in charge media. No, no, no, no. That's off limits.

48
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.870
I wasn't off limits for two and a half years. Uh, you know,

49
00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:24.890
kids are off limits Baron. Trump's not off limits. They hit him. You know,

50
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:28.040
Tiffany Trump who's in law school did nothing. You know, just a nice kid,

51
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.140
you know, going to school. She's not off limits.

52
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.110
I wasn't off limits when they spent two and a half years trying to throw me in

53
00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:36.860
jail for treason, for taking a 20 minute unsolicited meeting, Ben Hunter,

54
00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:39.860
Biden's off limits for a shady board seat in a corrupt company.

55
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.780
He's off limits when he takes 1.5 billion from the Chinese government,

56
00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:49.640
not like a Chinese investor from the Chinese government after traveling

57
00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:52.550
there on air force two with his father. Well,

58
00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:54.320
what would the media do if Donald Trump Jr.

59
00:02:54.321 --> 00:02:57.650
Did that show me that they said they didn't talk about it at the golf.

60
00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.950
Obviously they didn't mention the business.

61
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:02.440
They knew nothing about it when they're playing golf together. They, you know,

62
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.220
I just say, do the other thing, how about this? Let's go earlier in life.

63
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.900
Hunter Biden gets a great job at MBNA right out of school happens to be the

64
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:13.600
largest bank and the largest employer in the state of Delaware,

65
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:18.430
where Joe is the Senator signing favorable tax legislation. He's brilliant guy.

66
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.361
He's a brilliant guy.

67
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:22.180
So he manages to rise through the ranks there faster than anyone,

68
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.320
obviously totally a coincidence. He then gets a board seat on Amtrak at 27.

69
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.750
Huge he's a lover of trains. He's a lover of trains, obviously, Dave. I mean,

70
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:33.160
that's what, that's why he got it.

71
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:36.090
Nothing to do with daddy controlling the purse strings. No, no, no.

72
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.933
That's off limits.

73
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.270
I haven't talked much about it because honestly it's not even worth it,

74
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:43.360
but like you get frustrated enough cause they have to tack my personal life.

75
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:46.090
Everything about it, go, you know, what would happen if Donald Trump Jr.

76
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.640
Got thrown out of the Navy reserve in two weeks, you know,

77
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:53.590
for doing a little of the AAO, you know, you know, testing positive for cocaine,

78
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.570
you think they'd have a problem. You think that gave me the past.

79
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.520
People don't even hear about that. You know,

80
00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:01.120
turning in a rental car or with a crack pipe and all of these things like that.

81
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.010
And the media would have a field day so much.

82
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:06.940
So I almost should go do it because if,

83
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.180
when they catch it, they, the real death wish man,

84
00:04:10.181 --> 00:04:12.160
the aneurism that they would have, no, no, no,

85
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:14.950
it wouldn't be good for us because it would solve the fake news media problem.

86
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.530
Their heads would explode, uh,

87
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.800
without rage that there'd be none left and we could get Mack back to a

88
00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:21.640
reasonable discourse.

89
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:24.700
So they try to do this false equivalency of what's the difference I go,

90
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:25.840
that's the difference.

91
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.160
Like Hunter Biden made millions of dollars through his father's taxpayer funded

92
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:33.190
office has all this other shade in the past and he's totally off limits,

93
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:36.700
but you had no problem with half of Congress saying that I, you know,

94
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.080
literally committed treason,

95
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.400
a crime punishable by death for taking a 20 minute unsolicited meeting.

96
00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:47.230
But Hillary Clinton can go out, pay foreign agents to go collect dirt,

97
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.980
take that dirt through the DNC, leak it to the FBI,

98
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.960
the SBI then leaks it back to the press. The press writes their outrage story,

99
00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:01.000
which the FBI then uses as the basis of an investigation to

100
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.420
have individuals on a campaign for the president of the United States,

101
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:08.410
which started the whole Mueller hoax. I mean, where's the outrage,

102
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.400
not even the outrage. Where's the story. Right?

103
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.930
You have like a couple of guys on yo, Sarah Carter, Sean Hannity, Greg Jared,

104
00:05:16.931 --> 00:05:18.160
a couple of guys pointing out. But like,

105
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.040
where's like you think that this would be big news. I mean,

106
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:23.770
if you're a journalist, like this is kind of a big deal. I mean,

107
00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:28.300
this is a legitimate COO and they're just like nothing to see here.

108
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.010
Nothing going on here, guys,

109
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:32.500
we're just going to pretend this never happened because it,

110
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.420
it goes against what they would like to happen. It goes against the DNC talkers.

111
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.040
It goes against that media narrative.

112
00:05:39.041 --> 00:05:42.850
And since they've made that cognizant decision to be the marketing wing of the

113
00:05:42.851 --> 00:05:46.510
DNC, we should actually look into them, you know, for, you know,

114
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.310
for campaign finance violations,

115
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.910
because they're just literally contributing millions and billions of free

116
00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:54.610
marketing to the DNC covering for their.

117
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.920
So who in the course of all of this.

118
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.470
<v 1>I hear you on all of this, who in the course of all this, do you,</v>

119
00:06:00.471 --> 00:06:03.470
and I guess by extension, your dad actually take counsel from.

120
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:06.680
So I remember during, uh, the Michael Cohen testimony. Yeah.

121
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.870
He was one of the first moments when I was like,

122
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:10.430
this Russia thing is complete nonsense,

123
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.440
but the reason wasn't because of anything he said,

124
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.120
it was because you were live tweeting it. And I was like, if this guy is guilty,

125
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.080
it meaning you, if you were guilty of anything and our lawyers or everyone,

126
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:21.321
you know,

127
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:25.100
would be locking you up and putting you in a room and taking notes because you

128
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:26.270
were live tweeting. It's so funny.

129
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.560
<v 0>Oh, it was, it was funny like by lawyers, numerous, like he was like,</v>

130
00:06:29.561 --> 00:06:34.330
you can't do that. Like anything you say, I was like, I don't care. I'm right.

131
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.310
Like, I don't care. This is. And I'm going to say it like, so,

132
00:06:39.311 --> 00:06:39.521
I mean,

133
00:06:39.521 --> 00:06:42.190
I literally had that conversation that sat down with my lawyers numerous.

134
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.300
I'm like, you're in, I go, you guys are making one critical mistake.

135
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.950
If I sit down,

136
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.030
if I just sit in the corner and curl up in a ball and die or you know, cry,

137
00:06:52.031 --> 00:06:54.970
sucking my thumb in the fetal position, that's what they want. Like,

138
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.310
you think they're going to go any lighter on me.

139
00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.740
They're not Adam Schiff was on TV every day saying I committed treason.

140
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.560
And he seen evidence to the entire country. You see evidence of trays and,

141
00:07:05.561 --> 00:07:09.030
and collusion and all like, I still haven't seen it. You know what I mean?

142
00:07:09.031 --> 00:07:11.620
You think if he's seen it, no one else has like you think, Hey,

143
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.620
maybe it's time to drop it right now. Like it wasn't in the Mueller report.

144
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.320
But so I'm saying I'm just not going to do it, man.

145
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.340
I'm not going to just sit back. I get where you're going from a legal strategy.

146
00:07:21.341 --> 00:07:22.630
I'm not naive to that. It's not that.

147
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.870
<v 1>It's the right thing to do. I'm just saying I'm not.</v>

148
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.390
<v 0>You know, I'm not, I get where they're saying, I go, I just don't care.</v>

149
00:07:28.391 --> 00:07:31.300
And honestly, at the end of it, there go, you know what? You were right.

150
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.090
You needed to push back. Cause you could see it. I mean,

151
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.750
when there I'm in closed door testimony with the house intelligence committee,

152
00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:39.340
right. And I come back,

153
00:07:39.341 --> 00:07:41.980
I'm out of this thing after nine hours or so of testimony,

154
00:07:41.981 --> 00:07:43.450
I get out at seven o'clock at night.

155
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.220
And I look at Twitter and CNN at 1159, Donald Trump Jr.

156
00:07:48.221 --> 00:07:50.290
Was saying this, I go, Jesus Christ. I mean,

157
00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:53.380
Adam Schiff is taking bathroom breaks and leaking this stuff. Door closed, door,

158
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.050
closed door. It was supposed to be totally like, and I go back and say,

159
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.140
I'm looking back. Seven hours in advance. Every time we took a bathroom break,

160
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.030
CNN is breaking this stuff. I mean,

161
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.710
three of their big bombshells had to do with me now. They were all wrong.

162
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.730
They were all false. You know, one of them was the, the WikiLeaks,

163
00:08:09.731 --> 00:08:13.450
like some random dude, like literally DME or send me an email, like,

164
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.970
have you seen this? You know, it was like, whatever, like,

165
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.750
let's call it June 14th right now. They leaked the stuff to CNN.

166
00:08:19.751 --> 00:08:21.970
And I'm looking at the dates. They look, do you have comments on it?

167
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.380
It was June 4th. I was like, Holy. Like they deleted the one in 14.

168
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.650
Right? So the 14 you delete the one, it becomes four.

169
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.710
So the thing broke on like June 10th or whatever it was. Right.

170
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.760
So it looks like I had this information from some random,

171
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:37.720
there it's a Trump voter.

172
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.660
He donated like 25 bucks and some help like spammed our email.

173
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.960
So like actually like hit my email. So it got there. I didn't respond. I didn't,

174
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.060
but it looked like that. And based on the lead email,

175
00:08:46.061 --> 00:08:47.860
like I had it six days before,

176
00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:51.130
rather than four days after the rest of the freak in the world,

177
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.300
no different than sort of, you know,

178
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.500
meet outing the whistleblower after it's been out there in the public four days,

179
00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:00.180
I'm just like, Oh my God, no bombshell Donald Trump Jr. Had it. I'm like,

180
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.910
here's the toilets. Here's the emails saying,

181
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.800
how come we're the only ones being transparent? Like

182
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.840
you ever get a call so many, not even a retraction on some of these, the other,

183
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.470
you know, Michael Cohen was there when Donald Trump Jr said, no,

184
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:14.430
his lawyer pulled that one,

185
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.980
his Lilly or pulled it back because they got it wrong.

186
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.000
And they're the guys leaking it. Like it's so asinine. Like, you know,

187
00:09:21.001 --> 00:09:24.060
and then they questioned about now there was no questioning about him.

188
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:26.760
Then literally perjuring himself. I think it was eight or nine times.

189
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.720
Cause I'm willing to do it. I'm like, Nope, didn't happen. Check X, Y, Z.

190
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:33.330
I mean, you know, Jim Jordan, some of those called it out.

191
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.880
They sent that thing back to the DOJ. Be like, Hey, what about this?

192
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.660
Not that we're not playing the same game. And that's the problem. I mean,

193
00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:41.100
there are some Republicans that are doing it.

194
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.100
There's some that are learning from Trump because Trump has taught conservative,

195
00:09:44.101 --> 00:09:45.690
Hey, you know, you could fight back.

196
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.480
You don't just have to lose because they want you to,

197
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.200
you don't just have to give up because they're going to write a bad story about

198
00:09:52.201 --> 00:09:55.080
you. Like, but you know what the problem is, that mentality is still there.

199
00:09:55.081 --> 00:09:57.930
It's like, okay, well, you know, we're just, we're going to leave this again.

200
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.500
They would never give us that same benefit of the doubt. I say, Hey,

201
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:04.440
we can all play T-ball or we can all play hardball,

202
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.840
but we gotta be playing the same game. And we're not,

203
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:07.860
if you're looking for more, yeah.

204
