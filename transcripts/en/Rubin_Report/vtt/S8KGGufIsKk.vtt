00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.680
<v 0>In these cities, they don't give security or safety in these cities.</v>

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.860
They fail spectacularly.

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.380
And when it comes to education specific example, the city of Baltimore,

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.900
13 public high schools, you want to venture a guess what percentage?

5
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.160
And the 13 schools, not 13 kids, 13 public high schools.

6
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.850
What percentage of kids in those schools? And you don't have to answer.

7
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:27.684
It's not a trick question.

8
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.440
<v 1>Well, I'll ballpark it. I'll try just to see.</v>

9
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.280
<v 0>People are proficient in math and reading.</v>

10
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.240
<v 1>So for a guy that is governing like a conservative, that's,</v>

11
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.950
that's pretty obvious at this point.

12
00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:45.410
One of the things that we've talked about a couple of times on your show is

13
00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:49.280
what's happening in Portland, in Seattle, in Chicago, in New York,

14
00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:53.990
just the crazy situations of violence and murder and everything else

15
00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:57.470
because of these progressive policies, which by the way, years ago, well, well,

16
00:00:57.471 --> 00:00:59.690
before I knew you, when I would flick on your show,

17
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.210
you were basically the only guy that was talking about the,

18
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:06.830
the black on black crime in Chicago and nobody and everyone would,

19
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.770
what would they do? They would call you racist for it for even bringing it up.

20
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:10.221
You'd say, well,

21
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:14.480
30 black people died this weekend and they would call you the racist for it.

22
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.330
Um, but are you, are you concerned at all that,

23
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.050
that optics wise when Trump then sends in, uh,

24
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.980
the national guard and we get federal troops in these things that this is

25
00:01:24.981 --> 00:01:29.030
playing into the hand that, Oh, well, you see, he's, he's the authoritarian,

26
00:01:29.031 --> 00:01:32.600
he's the guy that wanted to throw all the, all the federal troops into the city.

27
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.610
<v 0>Well, when Obama said this week,</v>

28
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.710
the federal troops are using tear gas and Bhutan's on peaceful

29
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.960
protestors. That's not true.

30
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.190
And in spite of all the video evidence with Jerry Nadler and saying,

31
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.350
this is a myth actually said it,

32
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.480
or who would ever think that a major party presidential

33
00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:57.920
candidate would say the words, the police are the enemy by what?

34
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.850
And supporting defunding the police. I mean,

35
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.630
Joe Biden has yet to say a good thing about the

36
00:02:05.631 --> 00:02:09.710
99% of police, men and women that protect and serve their cities.

37
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.220
All of them put their lives on the line for all of us every single day.

38
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.260
And so you, you, you ask a great question. Uh,

39
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.790
Donald Trump has not sent in the national guard unless they request it.

40
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.950
He's been begging New York city and Chicago and

41
00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:30.590
Portland and Seattle begging them,

42
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.840
let us help you restore law and order and safety and security.

43
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.670
It can't pursue happiness.

44
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.940
They Reuben without law and order and a safe community.

45
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.990
If you're a one-year-old shot in a park in New York dad and a stroller or an

46
00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:49.610
eight year old little girl killed in Atlanta because her mom made a

47
00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:53.630
wrong turn into the chop zone near where the Wendy's that street had been taken

48
00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:56.450
over a new autonomous zone. Um,

49
00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.300
and that little girl in the back of the died after getting shot in the head

50
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.220
or a seven year old beautiful girl in Chicago died on the 4th of July

51
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:10.060
weekend. Uh, while at her grandmother's house, you know,

52
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.500
playing on the 4th of July or Horus, Lorenzo Anderson,

53
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.170
uh, junior, 19 years old,

54
00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:21.760
and his father that heart-wrenching interview that I had with him. Um,

55
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.180
it killed me. It was my, my kids 18 and 21. Anyway.

56
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.280
So the answer is he's offering now that's separate. And apart from the,

57
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.390
we're talking about a hundred troops that are being sent in to protect federal

58
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:38.860
property and federal courthouses. That's not only their job,

59
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.330
but their obligation because they would try and to burn them to the ground. Uh,

60
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.860
they're not there to restore law in order to the cities because the mayors

61
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.360
refuse to do it. What w what do all of these cities we're talking about?

62
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.320
New York, Chicago, Portland, Seattle, Los Angeles,

63
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.840
the city of Atlanta, what do they all have in common?

64
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.580
They've all been run by liberal Democrats for decades. Now,

65
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.660
if you believe as I do, and then I get into a lot of this in the book,

66
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.440
which is over your shoulder. Yeah. We're going to get there.

67
00:04:10.441 --> 00:04:13.930
We're going to get there. I promise. We'll get no, but that actually does this.

68
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.580
This does color a lot of this stuff in the book. A lot of it, it,

69
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.580
but if you believe it, our founding document,

70
00:04:20.581 --> 00:04:23.130
our founding document is our declaration, right?

71
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.860
Some people think it's the constitution know the founding document.

72
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.050
What does it say? I can remember it unlike, you know, cookie Jo, uh,

73
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.920
one of my favorite clip had all these truths to be self-evident that all men or

74
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.240
women are created by the thing, you know,

75
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.130
the thing, the thing, God, Joe, God, every the creator of everything. All right.

76
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.630
Oh, that scared me. So, but if you believe in that,

77
00:04:48.631 --> 00:04:53.280
what does that line doubt by our creator means that got rights for all of us.

78
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.990
And I believe those were why mine, my heart, my soul. They come from God.

79
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.720
They don't come from man. They don't come from government.

80
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.100
And that life, Liberty pursuit of happiness.

81
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.750
How do they Reuben? You tell me, how do you proceed to happiness?

82
00:05:09.751 --> 00:05:14.640
If you're living in those cities and you're not safe in a park or your grandma's

83
00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:16.470
backyard on the 4th of July,

84
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.940
or if your mom makes a wrong turn on a city street, uh,

85
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.800
or if your son is in the summer of love zone as mayor Dirk and said,

86
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.690
how do you pursue happiness? If you don't have basic law order safety, security,

87
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.160
how do you pursue happiness in all of these cities?

88
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.750
What is one other commonality?

89
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.270
They all have the worst educational records of most cities in the

90
00:05:42.271 --> 00:05:43.104
world.

91
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.700
We pay more per capita for education than any other

92
00:05:47.701 --> 00:05:51.630
country in the industrialized world. These cities have this income.

93
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.520
We have failed our children. If you look at a ladder, I used to be a contractor,

94
00:05:56.521 --> 00:05:59.330
right? You have the, of the ladder, right? Okay.

95
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.340
You take away that education and I'll give you a little, my BA my background.

96
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:05.150
I learned Latin.

97
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.350
I went to a seminary in high school and the word education from the Latin

98
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:12.110
derivative at Duker day to bring forth from within.

99
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.160
So if we believe that God gives you rights.

100
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.870
If education is to bring forth from what is already there from God talents,

101
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:25.790
he gave you, well, you need safety, security, you need education. So,

102
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:26.121
okay.

103
00:06:26.121 --> 00:06:29.120
Joe Biden is saying that the government's going to take care of everything you

104
00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:30.200
ever want in your life.

105
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.390
He's going to take care of a guaranteed job at a guaranteed wage and K

106
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:39.380
through college education and forgive student loans and government guaranteed

107
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:42.020
vacations and government guaranteed healthy food.

108
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.390
And you're going to have government guaranteed healthcare,

109
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.150
and you're going to have a gun government guaranteed retirement.

110
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:50.210
And you don't have a worry in the world. I'll get to the psychology of that.

111
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:51.230
Okay.

112
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.130
What is the track record in these liberal cities that have been run by liberals

113
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:59.510
for decades, which is what Joe Biden, adopting Bolshevik,

114
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:03.410
Bernie socialism, and AOC, new green deal. And,

115
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.640
and Bazell bozo as I call them or Rourke and

116
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.320
Bozo's gun confiscation plan. All right. So in these cities,

117
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.860
they don't give security or safety in these cities.

118
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.010
They fail spectacularly.

119
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.530
And when it comes to education specific example, the city of Baltimore,

120
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:30.080
13 public high schools, you want to venture a guess what percentage?

121
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.310
And the 13 schools, not 13 kids, 13 public high schools.

122
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.030
What percentage of kids in those schools? And you don't have to answer.

123
00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:38.864
It's not a trick question.

124
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.590
<v 1>I'll I'll ballpark it. I'll try. Just to see.</v>

125
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.840
<v 0>Believe are proficient in math and reading. Matt, let's start with math.</v>

126
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:51.250
<v 1>I mean, I, I'm going to guess I'm going to go obviously crazily low it's.</v>

127
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.010
I'm going to get what's it like 10%, something like that.

128
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.410
<v 0>Not one child in 13 public high schools,</v>

129
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.950
Baltimore spends they're the third,

130
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.510
highest per capita per student spending in the world,

131
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.280
not one kid in 13 schools. Okay. Here's the ladder.

132
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.710
Why don't you just take a sledgehammer,

133
00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.970
rip out all the rungs and beat out most sides of it because you don't have an

134
00:08:18.971 --> 00:08:22.540
education. So they don't provide security, safety, law order.

135
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.740
They don't provide education. All right. What else has government done for us?

136
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.000
If we're going to put all our hate,

137
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:32.590
we're going to believe Joe Biden and Bernie's socialist utopia and AOC is new

138
00:08:32.591 --> 00:08:34.120
green deal. Okay.

139
00:08:34.121 --> 00:08:37.270
And they're going to take care of every single need we have in life. Okay.

140
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.070
How social security doing Dave Rubin? Because the last I checked,

141
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.120
you're screwed.

142
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.680
I'll probably get something until they means test it because it's headed towards

143
00:08:47.681 --> 00:08:48.514
bankruptcy.

144
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.820
