00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.260
<v 0>It was super frustrating.</v>

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.120
I went with my mom to the most storied cathedrals to Western

3
00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:06.690
medicine.

4
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.370
And in every instance I experienced what I've come to call diagnose and

5
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:15.360
adios. And I have a lot of respect for medicine. In fact,

6
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:16.830
when I started college, I wanted to be a doctor.

7
00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:18.990
I was pre-med for the first few years,

8
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.090
but truly in,

9
00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:25.830
in none of those doctor's offices was diet or lifestyle ever really brought up.

10
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.711

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.920

14
00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:46.460
and the author of the new book, the genius life, max Luger here.

15
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.680
Welcome back to the Rubin report. So good to be here.

16
00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:51.860
Thank you for having me New York times, best selling author.

17
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.361
Where are you in New York times,

18
00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:57.350
best selling author last time you were about to become okay.

19
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.090
<v 0>About to become, I didn't know it at the time.</v>

20
00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:02.710
I had no idea how well genius foods would ultimately do, but, um,

21
00:01:02.711 --> 00:01:04.100
I'm super grateful,

22
00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:08.060
humble that it's reached big audience is now published in eight languages around

23
00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:10.340
the world. It's super cool. I was in Columbia.

24
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.870
I was in Bogota and I had like a line of Spanish speaking fans lined up to get

25
00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:17.060
their book signed and, you know, we could barely communicate,

26
00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:19.880
but it was just so, so gratifying to see that, you know.

27
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.440
<v 1>How does it change one's life to become a New York times bestselling author? Um,</v>

28
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.671
you know,

29
00:01:25.671 --> 00:01:29.420
I think he doesn't really like level up the amount of stuff that you suddenly

30
00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:30.171
get. Cause people are like, Oh,

31
00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:31.910
this guy actually does know what he's talking about.

32
00:01:31.911 --> 00:01:33.500
It's not just a book about food.

33
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.990
<v 0>It's a credential. Um, and you know, I'm, I'm very, uh,</v>

34
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.890
I never misrepresent myself. I mean, I'm, uh, I write about health and science,

35
00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:47.360
but I do it not from, uh, not with having a background in academia or medicine.

36
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.410
I'm just a, I'm passionately curious. And I it's a topic, you know,

37
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.680
that I think is the most important topic there is. Uh,

38
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.880
but the fact that the book continues to be it, wasn't just sort of a,

39
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.170
there's this metaphor in, in book sales, you know, when you,

40
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.640
when you launch a book it's like throwing up,

41
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.880
you could be throwing up either a feather or a brick and like a feather is what

42
00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:10.670
you want to happen because the feather, it goes up and then it kind of floats,

43
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.361
uh,

44
00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:14.600
the brick just ends up coming right down to the fact that genius foods has kind

45
00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:18.050
of just stayed up, you know, and it continues to, to,

46
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.130
to sell well, to me as a Testament, to the quality of the work,

47
00:02:22.131 --> 00:02:23.690
really ultimately, and as a writer,

48
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.070
that's the best form of flattery that you can, that you can get, you know, that,

49
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:32.150
that your writing is embraced and that it continues to do well. So yeah,

50
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.530
I'm super thrilled. It's given me the opportunity to write, um, this book,

51
00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:40.640
the genius life I have since launched my own podcast,

52
00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:41.960
which is also called the genius life.

53
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.860
So it's allowed me to get to do what I love to do. Full-time and,

54
00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:48.650
and as you know, it's a great thing to be, you know,

55
00:02:48.651 --> 00:02:53.600
to work for yourself and to, to be, um, driven on your own steam. Yeah.

56
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.660
<v 1>It's a pretty sweet thing. And you're building a studio in your apartment,</v>

57
00:02:56.661 --> 00:02:58.790
which I know a little something about that.

58
00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:01.000
So we could do a separate show on that, but, uh,

59
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.340
for people that didn't see our first interview, we'll,

60
00:03:03.341 --> 00:03:06.280
we'll link to it in this so they can jump back. Um,

61
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.830
but one of the things I find most interesting about you and you and I now go

62
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:12.790
back like six, seven years. So before you wrote genius foods, um,

63
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.440
your story on how you came to kind of care about this stuff is,

64
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.590
well, it's deeply personal, but it's also pretty fascinating actually.

65
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.360
Could you do like a quick recap on that?

66
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.440
<v 0>Absolutely. Yeah. I started as a journalist.</v>

67
00:03:25.441 --> 00:03:29.790
I was a generalist working for Al Gore's current TV, which was not a, my role.

68
00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:34.650
There was not as a, um, uh, a flag bearer of his political,

69
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.750
you know, ideas and environmental ideas. I was,

70
00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:39.360
I got the job right out of college and I got to cover stories that were

71
00:03:39.361 --> 00:03:43.890
important to me. And they ranged from health and technology to, um,

72
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.000
politics occasionally. But when I left that job after six years,

73
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.340
I started spending more and more time in New York city,

74
00:03:50.341 --> 00:03:53.520
which is where I'm from around my mother. And I'm first born child,

75
00:03:53.521 --> 00:03:54.600
very close to my mom.

76
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.980
She started at the age of 58 to display the earliest symptoms of dementia.

77
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.580
And she had a very strange confluence of symptoms.

78
00:04:02.581 --> 00:04:06.120
She had symptoms that were more indicative of a memory disorder,

79
00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:07.650
and then she had movement symptoms,

80
00:04:07.651 --> 00:04:12.090
which would indicate a more Parkinsonian complex, like Parkinson's disease.

81
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.220
And it was something that, um, was traumatic to, to witness.

82
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.490
Uh, you know, when we got the initial diagnosis.

83
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.910
<v 1>Were you literally the first person that noticed anything or was she noticing</v>

84
00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:25.080
that something was going on?

85
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.060
<v 0>She knows she was, she started to complain of brain fog memory problems, but,</v>

86
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.760
uh, we didn't have the vernacular in my family.

87
00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:35.760
We had no prior family history of any kind of neurodegenerative disease.

88
00:04:35.761 --> 00:04:39.930
And interestingly, my mom's mom, my maternal grandmother, um,

89
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.220
was she lived to 96 and she was cognitively sharp until the end. Wow.

90
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.760
So she was, my, my grandmother was not demented.

91
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.850
And so the idea that my grandma's my daughter,

92
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.860
my mom could somehow be succumbing to this condition that I think most people

93
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.810
assume to be an old person's disease.

94
00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.000
It just didn't compute didn't make any sense. Yeah.

95
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.600
And so when my mom was initially prescribed those, you know,

96
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.940
the drugs for Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease,

97
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.910
that was the first time in my life I'd ever had a panic attack. You know,

98
00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:11.640
I'm a pretty chill guy, but, uh, it was,

99
00:05:11.641 --> 00:05:13.350
I was alone in the hotel room in Cleveland,

100
00:05:13.351 --> 00:05:15.300
Ohio Googling the drug prescriptions,

101
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.940
which I think anybody would do in that position.

102
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.350
And the severity of the situation really dawned on me at that moment.

103
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.060
And from that point on,

104
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.670
I decided to dedicate all of my free time to

105
00:05:29.671 --> 00:05:31.650
investigating why this would have happened to my mom,

106
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.560
what could be done to help or what could be done to prevent it from happening to

107
00:05:34.561 --> 00:05:38.940
myself. And that began about eight years ago.

108
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.550
And, um, that was a struggle, obviously,

109
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:45.031
you know,

110
00:05:45.031 --> 00:05:48.870
watching my mom descend and become more and more handicapped by the disease.

111
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.070
And that's what motivated me to write, uh,

112
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.490
genius foods and to do all the work that I've, you know, that I, that I put out.

113
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.520
Um,

114
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.930
and what occurred after genius foods came out was,

115
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.120
uh, I mean, equally surprising, um, and equally heartbreaking.

116
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.250
I was in the middle of writing this book when my mom turned yellow.

117
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.140
And you could, I mean, usually if you turn yellow, uh, you know,

118
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:21.140
it's either going to be jaundice or you've eaten too much, beta carotene,

119
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:25.490
you've eaten too many carrots. Yeah. Um, but what happens, uh, with jaundice,

120
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.080
the whites of your eyes actually become yellow.

121
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:29.870
That's kind of what distinguishes it from just, you know, eating,

122
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.520
eating too many sweet potatoes.

123
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.940
And my family rushed her to the emergency room.

124
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:38.180
They did an MRI of her abdomen and what they discovered was not a gallstone,

125
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:39.350
which is typically what, you know,

126
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:42.110
it'll cause a blockage in the bile duct cause bilirubin,

127
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:45.440
which is a pigment to back up into your blood. What they found was much worse.

128
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:48.710
It was a tumor on the head of her pancreas. And, uh,

129
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.000
she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 90% of the time when pancreatic

130
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.050
cancer is diagnosed,

131
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:58.040
it's already progressed and it was three months and she was, you know,

132
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:01.720
it was the most, it was barbaric and brutal. And, uh, and,

133
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.560
and that's what she ultimately passed from.

134
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.160
But the fact that my mom had these two freak health conditions,

135
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.570
two of the most feared conditions, uh, known to humanity, um,

136
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.480
it motivates me every day to, to learn more,

137
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:19.100
to teach more and to just stay open and curious and always be willing to

138
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.180
challenge my assumptions and my beliefs about what it means to be healthy in the

139
00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:24.020
21st century.

140
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.540
<v 1>Yeah. Well, that's why I think your story is so cool. I mean, just like, you're,</v>

141
00:07:27.541 --> 00:07:30.460
you're a good guy, but you've also like, even when I, you know,

142
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.000
follow you on Instagram and you do a lot of like, you know, don't eat this,

143
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:36.580
eat this kind of stuff. It's a very, it's very human.

144
00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:39.130
You're not like beating people over the head with all this.

145
00:07:39.131 --> 00:07:40.660
And I want to get to some of those, uh,

146
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.230
techniques and little tricks that you use to make things a little bit healthier.

147
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:45.491
Um, but when your,

148
00:07:45.491 --> 00:07:49.360
when your mom got diagnosed and then subsequently when you did all of the things

149
00:07:49.361 --> 00:07:52.570
that you tried to do over the course of that time, um,

150
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.230
was anyone else talking about food or was it all just like,

151
00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.110
this is what you take. This is what you take, we'll up it here. If this happens,

152
00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:02.350
you do this, like, was there any, like eat more avocado? No.

153
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.850
<v 0>Oh, it was super frustrating.</v>

154
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.680
I went with my mom to the most storied cathedrals to Western

155
00:08:08.681 --> 00:08:09.250
medicine.

156
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.930
And in every instance I experienced what I've come to call diagnose and

157
00:08:13.931 --> 00:08:17.920
adios. And I have a lot of respect for medicine. In fact,

158
00:08:17.921 --> 00:08:19.390
when I started college, I wanted to be a doctor.

159
00:08:19.391 --> 00:08:21.580
I was pre-med for the first few years,

160
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.660
but truly in,

161
00:08:24.661 --> 00:08:28.510
in none of those doctor's offices was diet or lifestyle ever really brought up.

162
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.870
And the contrast between what I was experiencing in the,

163
00:08:31.871 --> 00:08:35.560
in the clinician's offices with my mom and what I started to discover in the

164
00:08:35.561 --> 00:08:36.341
medical literature,

165
00:08:36.341 --> 00:08:41.050
there was just this big Valley in between the dearth of information and the,

166
00:08:41.051 --> 00:08:45.370
and the despair that I was seeing there with my mom and the optimism that I was

167
00:08:45.371 --> 00:08:48.130
reading about, um, in the, in the medical literature.

168
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.780
And ultimately what I did was I realized that I had met, uh, media credentials,

169
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.460
and I started to reach out to scientists and who were the authors of the papers

170
00:08:56.461 --> 00:09:00.960
that I was reading. And they echoed that, that sentiment of optimism.

171
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.570
And yet at the point of care with my mom,

172
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:07.230
what I experienced was was anything but optimistic.

173
00:09:07.231 --> 00:09:12.060
So I really had to take it upon myself. And I think when you're a patient,

174
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.090
my mom was scared. She was confused.

175
00:09:15.091 --> 00:09:18.000
She didn't have a framework for understanding health or science or anything like

176
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:22.620
that. I did because I had a, I had had a lifelong passion for the topic. Um,

177
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.160
but, but really, I think there are a lot of people in our,

178
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:30.720
in her shoes that are met with the same kind of, um, I don't know,

179
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:35.250
like a hopelessness and yeah, you're right. I mean, what they, what,

180
00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:39.540
what every doctor would ultimately do would titrate up the dose of a medication

181
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:42.060
that she was already on, throw something new into the mix.

182
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.690
And by the time my mom passed, she was on 10 different pharmaceuticals.

183
00:09:45.691 --> 00:09:47.040
I'm not even being hyperbolic.

184
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.000
And there's just no way that a physician can have, you know,

185
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:55.980
any idea of how each of those pills are interacting with one another in a

186
00:09:55.981 --> 00:09:57.900
body that's growing increasingly frail.
