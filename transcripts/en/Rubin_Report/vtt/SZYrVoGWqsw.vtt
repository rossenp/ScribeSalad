00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.010
<v 0>What hasn't happened in?</v>

2
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.240
It is certainly my life term or my recollection is a guy like Brennan and

3
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:10.710
clapper, deciding that a politician or someone running this one,

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.910
president Trump in this case,

5
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.010
Kennedy Trump in this case was not good enough to assume the presidency.

6
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.990
So they were doing things to kneecap his administration.

7
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.720
<v 1>So.</v>

8
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.050
<v 2>Comes in basically as the firecracker to, you know,</v>

9
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.720
throw the chess board up the whole thing, um,

10
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.780
the administrative state or the deep state,

11
00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:37.310
or maybe you have a different phrase for it.

12
00:00:37.311 --> 00:00:42.230
This is this idea of a constant group of people

13
00:00:42.231 --> 00:00:45.200
that stay no matter what administration comes and goes.

14
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.920
Can you just explain a little bit about what that actually is?

15
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.680
<v 0>Lord have mercy. All right. So folks, uh, who get there,</v>

16
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.720
uh, those jobs, you are there for 20, 25, 30 years. Um,

17
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.990
and it's true that you out last, all ministrations.

18
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.440
<v 2>Are these jobs. Like let's really do like the most base level here,</v>

19
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.320
because this is the type of thing you hear, deep state and everyone online.

20
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.020
You're, you're either a conspiracy theorist or an Alex Jones guy,

21
00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:15.370
or you give me something like, what are these people actually do?

22
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.260
<v 0>All right. So when you let's shake the CIA, right?</v>

23
00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:21.470
So someone like me who went in as an operations officer,

24
00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:24.770
so somebody basically goes out in the field or Coots buys and steal secrets,

25
00:01:24.771 --> 00:01:27.550
right? You have a tremendous amount of power, right?

26
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.170
A tremendous number of tools to read people's emails,

27
00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:33.050
listen to people's phone calls. I mean, you can call it surveillance teams.

28
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.060
You have a lot of power to do or accomplish the mission. And through that,

29
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.980
some people had this mistaken belief that they are now anointed to make

30
00:01:42.981 --> 00:01:47.030
decisions, uh, writ large in terms of foreign policy. That is,

31
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.270
they are the ones that have the knowledge to decide what the nation should or

32
00:01:50.271 --> 00:01:54.680
shouldn't do on a particular issue instead of simply informing a policy maker to

33
00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:57.500
say, here's what I know to be true. Here's what I think we ought to do.

34
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.340
But here are slew different options and you make the choice for the call because

35
00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:04.070
you're a representative, the people, and I am simply a tool.

36
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.670
<v 2>So basically they sort of have access to all of this information.</v>

37
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.740
And then after years of it,

38
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.130
you start thinking you're bigger than the people that are coming. Yeah.

39
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.730
<v 0>So one of the most infamous spies Aldrich, Ames who worked for the CIA,</v>

40
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.910
but indeed worked for the Russian secretly was eventually found out,

41
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.620
led to over 100 individuals, assets being killed when he was asked,

42
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:29.030
why he did it. He said, I know what's best for the nation's foreign policy.

43
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.380
And I'm going to act on that. So that degree of hubris, right?

44
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.560
You go in loving your country, embracing the flag. You're there,

45
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.940
the CIA for the right reasons.

46
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.180
But now suddenly you've come to this belief that you are anointed,

47
00:02:41.181 --> 00:02:45.740
that you are somehow that the guardian of the Republic beyond

48
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.430
the, the, the, the defensive nature that, that you,

49
00:02:49.431 --> 00:02:53.390
the people your government has, has anointed on you to actually do good things,

50
00:02:53.391 --> 00:02:56.510
to support the constitution and support policy makers. Now,

51
00:02:56.511 --> 00:02:59.830
you think that you're actually a King or a queen behind the scenes,

52
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.830
and you will move the, the, the will levers of power.

53
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.300
And you will decide who gets briefed on what pieces of information or you don't

54
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.560
brief certain pieces of information. I'll give you an example. So I worked a,

55
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.660
an issue that I, I can't talk a ton about,

56
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.950
but an Asia related concern and what we were briefing the white house was that

57
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:21.550
what we, as the CIA were doing in terms of record covert action operations were

58
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:24.940
incredibly successful, but I actually knew that that wasn't true.

59
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.780
So I sat down with the analyst and I said, it helped me understand why, uh,

60
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.660
you all make this judgment, like, well,

61
00:03:30.661 --> 00:03:32.770
we don't make that judgment that we don't believe that's true.

62
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:36.040
So I collated all this information. I presented it to our,

63
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.010
what we call the seventh floor. And I said, you know,

64
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:43.390
serves what we are presenting to the white house, uh, as effective isn't.

65
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.320
And they said, well, you know, the song of dancing. And then they said, look,

66
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.300
why don't you read that downtown? Right.

67
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.360
Knowing that I had absolutely no ability to do that. Right.

68
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.530
So they just sort of,

69
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.760
it took an issue that they knew would be problematic for the agency for

70
00:03:57.761 --> 00:04:01.360
themselves. Uh, they lied about it to the NSC and to the white house.

71
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.830
And they decided what was best for America's foreign policy,

72
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:08.860
as it relates to that particular country in that particular issue around weapons

73
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:10.360
of mass destruction. So it's a,

74
00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:14.920
one is a tiny little example of how the deep state can decide

75
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.540
what a nation should or shouldn't do.

76
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.250
Th th th th the rubric that I think has been crossed that's that kind of stuff

77
00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:22.540
is more typical Washington.

78
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.230
What hasn't happened in it is certainly my life term,

79
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.830
or my recollection is a guy like Brennan and clapper,

80
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.550
deciding that a politician or someone running this one,

81
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.260
president Trump in this case, Kennedy,

82
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:39.850
Trump in this case was not good enough to assume the presidency.

83
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.860
So they were doing things to kneecap his administration

84
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.360
before, or I should say his election, his ability to become an elected official.

85
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.410
<v 2>Yeah. Can you, can you explain a little bit about what these guys were.</v>

86
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.780
<v 0>Doing? So let's just start with the dossier. Yeah.</v>

87
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.990
<v 2>Because to me, you've had tweets deleted over this. I mean,</v>

88
00:04:57.991 --> 00:05:02.700
Twitter tried to try to bite you and ban you because you started as a former

89
00:05:02.701 --> 00:05:06.900
CIA guy, you started talking about what, what Brandon was up to, what they,

90
00:05:06.901 --> 00:05:10.080
what these guys were doing. And they, they were going to boot you off Twitter.

91
00:05:10.081 --> 00:05:11.820
And then eventually there was enough of an outcry.

92
00:05:11.821 --> 00:05:14.820
I tried to help as much as I could to get you back on there. Yeah.

93
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.700
<v 0>Yeah. So, all right. If we just look at the dossier,</v>

94
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.900
we knew for a considerable amount of time that this information was unvetted and

95
00:05:21.901 --> 00:05:25.410
uncorroborated, it was, it was internet. Rumor, I think,

96
00:05:25.411 --> 00:05:28.830
is what was in the IEG report, right? So it was one know that this was garbage,

97
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.840
but yet it was utilized by the FBI to continue surveillance of a Trump

98
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.100
campaign officials.

99
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.950
<v 2>This is before the election, this dossier,</v>

100
00:05:37.951 --> 00:05:40.860
which is basically an internet rumor is now used.

101
00:05:40.861 --> 00:05:44.280
So the CIA can use spying techniques. But let me,

102
00:05:44.281 --> 00:05:47.700
let me just tell you how I'm just trying to get me down. Yeah.

103
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.040
<v 0>We had a foreign spy.</v>

104
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.170
It was hired by a domestic political opponent inject this garbage

105
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.500
into the system, which if you work in the field,

106
00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.060
do you know that any Russian sources are oftentimes controlled by Vladimir the

107
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.640
SVR? Right? So unless you really,

108
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.440
[inaudible] amazing these Russians.

109
00:06:08.441 --> 00:06:12.590
So we're pumping this fake garbage that we haven't vetted into the political

110
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:16.880
system or using it for surveillance purposes. And now,

111
00:06:16.881 --> 00:06:20.360
and here's the kicker in early January of 2017,

112
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.310
they clapper and call me and Brendan leaked this dossier to the

113
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:27.260
press, which had already been circulated out there,

114
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:30.980
but giving it their stamp of, we know it exists, and we're going to brief this,

115
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:31.311
right? So we,

116
00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:35.960
they briefed it to president elect Trump and the very act of doing that and

117
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:36.381
saying, Hey,

118
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:41.000
you should be aware that this exists suddenly gave the hook for the press to run

119
00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:44.300
with this story, that we have a Russian agent sitting in the white house,

120
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.890
the FBI and the CIA, you know, they believed enough in his document to brief it.

121
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.730
And then of course the fire was set, right?

122
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.030
The brush fire took off the hysteria was launched,

123
00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.710
but what's amazing is the next number of days in the next couple of weeks,

124
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.810
every one of those bastards, comi and clapper, Brandon, all of them said, Oh,

125
00:07:05.811 --> 00:07:08.480
but you know the dossier, we don't believe it. I guess it's just,

126
00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:10.430
it's just rumors. Well then why'd your briefing?

127
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.530
Why did you spread it around Washington?

128
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.590
Because you knew that it would cause a brush fire.

129
00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:17.480
You knew it would set this nation on fire.

130
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.290
And you knew that the Trump presidency would likely, never recover from it.

131
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.153
And in fact,

132
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.910
John Brennan told a crowd here in Los Angeles that president Trump would no

133
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:30.500
longer be an office interview. He gave in at, by the end of 2018,

134
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.020
he told a bunch of these Hollywood elites. Don't worry about it.

135
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.000
Trump's going to be gone by the end of 2018.

136
00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.330
Thank God John Brennan was gone and now he's under criminal investigation.

137
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.650
<v 2>Okay. So that was my next question. How,</v>

138
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.510
how nervous should clapper and Brennan and Comey be? I mean,

139
00:07:46.511 --> 00:07:49.690
clapper is the guy who lied under oath when they asked him about, uh,

140
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:54.610
are we doing master balance on people are in our own citizens and what it was it

141
00:07:54.611 --> 00:07:57.640
not wittingly that he said as he was scratching the top of his head,

142
00:07:57.641 --> 00:07:59.440
which you ever see that episode of Seinfeld, you know,

143
00:07:59.441 --> 00:08:01.930
when you're lying the higher up on your face that you scratch,

144
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.350
it tells you if it's a big lie or not. I mean, he's literally going, not winning

145
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.710
starts crying, but then, but then,

146
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:13.720
but then becomes like a CNN analyst on this and suffers ramifications for lying

147
00:08:13.721 --> 00:08:16.870
under oath, right? How, how much trouble do you think these guys really,

148
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:17.733
I think they're on.

149
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.650
<v 0>And I think that they know it and I am as a, as an American,</v>

150
00:08:20.651 --> 00:08:23.560
forget my party affiliation, forget it. You know, having worked in the CIA,

151
00:08:23.561 --> 00:08:25.300
although that's a part of my anger,

152
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.270
because I know what they've done to the intelligence community they have now

153
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:32.980
made the American people reasonably concerned about a degree of politicization

154
00:08:32.981 --> 00:08:36.670
that they were aware of or that they thought would be impossible.

155
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.340
So they have really solely not only the reputation,

156
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.940
but the ability of the FBI and the CIA to go out and do the good work that they

157
00:08:42.941 --> 00:08:47.680
need to do. We do in fact, need an FBI and CIA to do the good work that they do,

158
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.680
but it's reasonable for an American to step back and say,

159
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.530
maybe we shouldn't have these guys because they're highly politicized.

160
00:08:53.531 --> 00:08:55.800
So I think that Brennan and, and collaborate,

161
00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:59.220
and that whole cabal that was involved in these shenanigans in 2016 should be

162
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:02.160
very worried. John Durham, a very, very smart man.

163
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:04.410
And I think AGU bars playing a long game on this one,

164
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.560
I think he's letting comi go on some of the smaller stuff. I mean,

165
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:09.480
he's hitting them hard in some areas.

166
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:12.610
And the IgE has called him a dangerous man, a man who,

167
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.370
a dangerous precedent for the 30 plus thousand former and current FBI employees.

168
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.670
And I think you're going to find the same thing, uh, with, with, with, uh,

169
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.630
clapper and Brennan.

170
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.170
<v 2>So if these guys did so much bad stuff,</v>

171
00:09:24.171 --> 00:09:26.690
what do you make of the fact that they don't shut up? Like,

172
00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:29.300
what do you make of the fact that Comey wrote the book? You know,

173
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.390
which nobody bought the books, they pushing the hell out and teaches ethics.

174
00:09:32.391 --> 00:09:35.240
What is happening in this world? Or look at Brennan's Twitter feed.

175
00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:38.090
It's just like, wait a minute. You were the head of the CIA.

176
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.110
I don't think you should be like,

177
00:09:39.111 --> 00:09:41.810
you're basically attacking one of the institutions,

178
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.300
the office of the presidency. Now I get it. Trump attacks everybody too.

179
00:09:44.301 --> 00:09:47.540
So there's nobody that's totally clean here. But like, I, you know,

180
00:09:47.541 --> 00:09:51.320
you look at Brennan's Twitter feed and it's like, what, what are you doing?

181
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:52.970
What, but they don't,

182
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:56.120
I guess they feel that they'll never be caught if you're looking for more honest

183
00:09:56.121 --> 00:09:59.540
and thoughtful conversations about politics instead of nonstop yelling,
