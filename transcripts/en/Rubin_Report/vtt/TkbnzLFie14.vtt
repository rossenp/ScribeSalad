1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.680
<v 0>And of course what it all clarified was the fact that the Antifa</v>

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.040
activists are, have a very clear policy,

3
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:12.330
which is that they want to provoke the police or need any law enforcement

4
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.980
into something they can pretend is an act of violence that they can catch on

5
00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:20.730
camera and use as an explanation for the allegedly fascists nature of the

6
00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:21.600
American state.

7
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.720
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

8
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.950
<v 2>When you left Los Angeles, I said goodbye to you. And you said,</v>

9
00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:37.430
I'm going to Portland. And I said, why are you going to Portland?

10
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.230
And I think you said, I need to see it for myself. So you went up to Portland,

11
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.510
what'd you see up in Portland?

12
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.980
<v 0>I slightly shot my bolt on this because I wrote a piece for one of the papers</v>

13
00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:53.360
saying California is a, California is a failed state. And then I went to Oregon.

14
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.370
Um, yeah. Um,

15
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.430
Portland is some people say to me, you know,

16
00:01:01.431 --> 00:01:04.430
why do you need to go and see this stuff for yourself? And I just think it's,

17
00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:06.770
it's an instinctive curiosity I have. And I also,

18
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.430
even when it is exactly what you think it is going to be,

19
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.180
it's still interesting. You know, um, Portland,

20
00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:18.140
Oregon was exactly what I feared. It would be, but a bit worse. Um,

21
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.320
I was horrified by the immiseration of the city,

22
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.010
the total destruction of all public monuments and public buildings,

23
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.580
the shuffling up of shops, intimidation of the citizenry,

24
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.720
the demoralization of the citizenry, uh, a homelessness problem,

25
00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:37.250
which makes even California's look minimal. Um, and, uh,

26
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.750
the fact that the city is basically been given over to, uh, an,

27
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:44.060
a misery to lawlessness.

28
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.770
I went with Antifa several nights in a row,

29
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.900
uh, to pardon the language, a gentrification protest,

30
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.390
which was my first. And, um, yeah,

31
00:01:59.391 --> 00:02:03.710
it was, yes. I've heard the two always avoided the temptation. I,

32
00:02:03.711 --> 00:02:06.200
I quite like gentrification, actually. I think it's, uh,

33
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.970
I think that how has this being made nicer and neighborhood being smarter is no

34
00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:14.540
bad thing, but old fashioned view. Uh,

35
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.080
certainly not the view of anti for important who sectioned off some of the

36
00:02:18.081 --> 00:02:20.690
streets and went through them in the middle of the night,

37
00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:24.470
screaming at the citizens and the house owners telling them they will all stay

38
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.880
on stolen land. There's included many black families, by the way, uh,

39
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.540
shouting at these black families, white families, families,

40
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.420
wherever the background, shouting at them, they were on stolen land and, um,

41
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.830
and should get out.

42
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.650
<v 2>Were you worried, were you worried for your own safety? I mean, you were,</v>

43
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.650
you were out there with them. I mean, people know who you are.

44
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.080
<v 0>Yes. I was. Um, uh, lucky enough in the era of mask wearing,</v>

45
00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:52.640
you can cover almost your entire face, uh, lawfully, indeed,

46
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.290
almost compulsively. And, um, uh, I was,

47
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.491
uh, I mean,

48
00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:03.310
I've been worse places and war zones where there's more

49
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:07.530
lawlessness than that, but I, I, it was not an, a pleasant situation to be in,

50
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.620
in a, what is nominally, a first world city? Um, uh,

51
00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:14.920
the second night I went with them to the protest,

52
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.920
to the ice facility where, um,

53
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.560
which was a bit Harrier because they were assaulting the,

54
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.420
so it is one of the very few, um, federal buildings in the, in the area.

55
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.480
Uh, they play a game of cat and mouse with law enforcement.

56
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.910
They get closer and closer to the front of the building.

57
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.880
Their aim in the past has been to barricade in the buildings,

58
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.040
put burning dumpster trucks in front of them,

59
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:38.740
and then kill the people inside by burning them alive.

60
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.660
So that's their modus operandi.

61
00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:43.120
So you can understand why the ice officers don't want that.

62
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.250
And they get within a certain closeness to the door and then the,

63
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.200
uh, officers break out and, uh, there was firing tear, gas,

64
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.690
pepper, bullets, and all that.

65
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.650
And people were setting fire to things in the street. And, uh, and that was,

66
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.420
that was a unpleasant. Yes. Uh, it got, um, uh, uh,

67
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.390
uh, you know, shoot out of, uh, uh, of, uh,

68
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.310
an alleyway by federal officers with a bunch of other Antifa

69
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:16.120
with me. And, um, the officers at gunpoint, you know,

70
00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:20.410
told us please to move out of the alleyway and it was

71
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.830
unpleasant, but I have to say that considering the situation,

72
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:27.940
I thought the officers, whereas as decent and reasonable and, uh, um,

73
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.280
efficient in their duties as they could possibly be.

74
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.200
And of course what it all clarified was the fact that the Antifa

75
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.560
activists are, have a very clear policy,

76
00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:42.850
which is that they want to provoke the police or need any law enforcement

77
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.470
into something they can pretend is an act of violence that they can catch on

78
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:51.220
camera and use as an explanation for the allegedly fascists nature of the

79
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:54.910
American state. Um, they are,

80
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.820
it was very interesting to see these activists up close.

81
00:04:57.821 --> 00:05:02.290
I thought they were all, um, reprehensible people.

82
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.760
I thought they were clearly mentally in a very

83
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.770
unstable place. I thought that furthermore,

84
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:15.670
on election night in Washington, DC, when I saw Antifa, um,

85
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.120
gathering in the doorways, just outside the North lawn of the white house,

86
00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:21.820
the world's press were pointing their cameras at the white house.

87
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.620
And beside them underneath some of the doorways I saw what was clearly for

88
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.850
gathering because they were changing into clothes so that they couldn't be

89
00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:33.520
recognized by if CCTV cameras, uh,

90
00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:37.960
went over to film this because it was clear that this was what was going on.

91
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:42.490
And they became very violent, very fast. And, uh, um,

92
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.490
uh, they are thugs. They're a paramilitary group.

93
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.250
They have no place in a democracy. Um,

94
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.940
it's to America's shame that they've been allowed to do what they have been

95
00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:54.460
doing. They threatened to kill journalists.

96
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.280
They had graffitied kill Andy mutual friend,

97
00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:01.190
and a journalist and reporter in Portland, Oregon.

98
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.510
They had repeated calls to murder him across the city.

99
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:10.070
Um, uh, the fact that they can then intimidate a journalist, uh,

100
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:14.850
from abroad who even has the tenacity to try to capture them on

101
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.070
video camera, uh, or look at what they're doing is very bad.

102
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:20.390
There's an embarrassment from America.

103
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:21.710
I think the whole thing's an embarrassment.

104
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.910
<v 2>Did you get a sense that when you're on the ground with him,</v>

105
00:06:24.911 --> 00:06:27.160
that there is a leader because you know,

106
00:06:27.161 --> 00:06:30.400
this is what Joe Biden described Antifa as an idea.

107
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.230
And partly what I think it seems to be is that there's no sort of known leader

108
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.920
sort of by design, but when you're out there with these groups, DC, Portland,

109
00:06:38.921 --> 00:06:41.290
wherever you are, could you sense like, Oh,

110
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.890
somebody is actually in charge or is it just like this roving gang? Yeah.

111
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.430
<v 0>No, of course they have a leadership. Uh,</v>

112
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.630
Andy knows forthcoming book will reveal a lot about this. Um, but yeah,

113
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.490
of course they have a leadership. Uh, they don't gather like, uh,

114
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.570
moisture or something. I mean, it's a, they are brought together.

115
00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:04.930
They are organized, they advertise within their own groups,

116
00:07:04.931 --> 00:07:07.060
what they're going to do and when, and what their actions are.

117
00:07:07.061 --> 00:07:11.860
They tell people what to bring or what not to bring what to

118
00:07:11.861 --> 00:07:15.500
say and what not to say, what to chant and what not to chant. And, uh, um,

119
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.950
and yeah, I mean, they, they, they, they do the whole thing.

120
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:20.440
They have an organized group. And by the way, one of the,

121
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.070
one of the most haunting things for me was, uh, I mean, I,

122
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.930
I interviewed lots of people on my travels, including black police officers in,

123
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.870
uh, Oregon, who I think were some of the most, um,

124
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:36.550
the bravest most remarkable. And I thought, um,

125
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.480
restrained people I've ever met. Uh,

126
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.430
but one of the concessions that haunted me even more than that was speaking to

127
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.230
an owner of a restaurant in caffeine, uh, Portland who, uh,

128
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:55.090
had just recently had, um, just the day before had had bullets live ammunition,

129
00:07:55.091 --> 00:07:59.560
but it's fired through the windows of his, his business because he,

130
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.570
it seemed because he has photos on the wall of, um, first responders,

131
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.130
a woman, a woman soldier, a us soldier,

132
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:13.510
a man in Fireman's uniform. And this apparently makes him a,

133
00:08:13.511 --> 00:08:16.450
a representative of the fascistic American state,

134
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:21.040
thus live ammunition is fired by Antifa BLM activists through his business.

135
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.510
By the way, he is a, is a black American, a very proud Patriot.

136
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.920
And he said to me, actually, we talked about this. I said to him, you know,

137
00:08:29.921 --> 00:08:33.880
what do you think of the, uh, of the them presidential contender,

138
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:36.280
Joe Biden's claim that it's just an idea.

139
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:40.090
And he pointed to the bullet holes in his business, his windows, and he said,

140
00:08:40.091 --> 00:08:42.790
but an idea, doesn't fire bullets.
