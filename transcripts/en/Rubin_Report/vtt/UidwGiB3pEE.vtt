1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.820
<v 0>It's, it's not easy to be great.</v>

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.710
It's very challenging that commitment, that consistency over time.

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.650
And that's one of the things Colby studies just like it's simple math.

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.100
I just put in double the hours as everyone else. When I was a teenager,

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.340
it was the first year he started playing basketball at a summer camp.

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.940
He didn't score one point in this whole, like summer, uh,

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.570
and this tournament that he played in and then he started doing double the hours

8
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.090
and the next year he was like the highest score. He was like,

9
00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:30.810
it was simple math. I wasn't more talented. I simply put in more.

10
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.720
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

11
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.760
<v 2>Pretty solid segue for about 30 reasons to get to a little bit of your,</v>

12
00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:47.240
your chat with Kobe Bryant,

13
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.320
because I think it encapsule encapsulates so much of what you're talking about.

14
00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:55.340
So I watched it again this morning and we talked about it when I was on your

15
00:00:55.341 --> 00:00:57.950
show. And I hadn't seen the interview of you and Coby.

16
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.840
And what I said to you in that interview was that this was just a few weeks

17
00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:04.280
after, after he died,

18
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.870
is that it felt like it was like a rip in the universe because it's hard to

19
00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:12.440
fathom putting aside the tragedy of all the other people in his daughter,

20
00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:16.430
of course, but those aren't public people that we know, but of course it's as,

21
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.470
as equal a tragedy, obviously,

22
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.200
but there was something about Coby that it was like,

23
00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:23.680
I told you I was watching sports, uh, you know, the,

24
00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:26.210
the spectrum Lakers channel the day before.

25
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.080
And I saw him and he was just being interviewed and he's in a suit and he's got

26
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:31.790
the beard and he looks really sharp. And I was like, man,

27
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.970
that guy's just living his best life. That was literally the day before.

28
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.400
And it feels like a rip in the universe when someone who's doing all of the

29
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:44.510
things that you just described, who has reached the pinnacle of their sport,

30
00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:48.110
but then flourished after and started this basketball Academy and a good

31
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.130
jillion, other things then disappears from the earth.

32
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.240
So can you just talk a little bit about what it was like to sit down with Colby

33
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.130
and what it taught you and did he have all of those pieces?

34
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.800
Cause, cause literally just everything that you just laid out right there,

35
00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:05.390
that's what he was talking about in the interview.

36
00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:08.570
And you could see it was real there, there was no BS behind.

37
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.600
<v 0>Yeah. It was a powerful experience. The whole,</v>

38
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.780
the whole setup of it was powerful. We booked the interview the day before.

39
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.580
So I didn't really have much time to prep,

40
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.050
which was probably a good thing for me.

41
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.510
Cause I didn't have like two weeks to think about it. I've got Colby.

42
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.330
It was like literally booked it at 6:00 PM. I think the night before.

43
00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:26.810
And then I was there at 6:00 AM the next morning and his office in the OSI.

44
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.730
And I remember, uh, the most powerful thing he taught me was not what he said,

45
00:02:31.731 --> 00:02:36.200
but his example and what I mean by that is when we got to his office,

46
00:02:36.201 --> 00:02:40.070
I think it was probably around six, 15, six 30.

47
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.760
The interview was at eight o'clock and I knew I was, the publicist was like,

48
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.510
you've got 20 minutes. I think she originally said, you've got 15 minutes,

49
00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:50.840
but I was like, please give me 20. Right when I asked two questions. Yeah,

50
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.333
we get there.

51
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.590
And the assistant opens the door for us and there's a big office space in the

52
00:02:57.591 --> 00:03:01.000
orange County. And she says where we normally film. But my mind,

53
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:02.380
I was like that doesn't really look that good.

54
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:05.410
Can I look around the office and see if there's another spot we can set up our

55
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:06.244
cameras.

56
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.990
So we walked through the office and we go down kind of this long hall with,

57
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.360
um, conference rooms on each side of the hallway with glass windows,

58
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.930
you can see inside the conference rooms.

59
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.850
And then it walks down into another big open space of more

60
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:25.560
office, uh, chairs and things like that. Walked down.

61
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.770
I see the other room. I'm like, I don't really like anything here.

62
00:03:28.771 --> 00:03:31.050
Let's go back to the original space.

63
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.120
So we walked back through the glass hallway and the last window on

64
00:03:36.121 --> 00:03:41.100
the left, I see it. The lights are off and the back of the room, probably 20,

65
00:03:41.101 --> 00:03:41.880
30 feet back.

66
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.650
I see a shadow of a man like this looking up open

67
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.220
ceiling and no computer scheme was on.

68
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.840
There was no phone in his hand look real quick.

69
00:03:51.841 --> 00:03:55.380
Double-take and I see it's Coby sitting there like this, just looking at it.

70
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.850
This is six 15 in the morning. And I'm thinking our interview is not till eight.

71
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.510
And I'm thinking to myself, I asked the assistant, I go, what's that Toby?

72
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.570
She goes, yeah. And I go, what's he doing here so early?

73
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.290
Like this is his company. This is his space. Why's he here she goes,

74
00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:13.410
he's been here for almost an hour. And he was at the gym with his daughter.

75
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.490
The one who passed away at 4:00 AM working out with her and he comes here.

76
00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:20.400
He's always the first one here. And he's always the most prepared.

77
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.550
Just that moment alone of seeing Kobe as a shadow, looking up.

78
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.200
And I can only imagine he was visualizing his dream. He was going over, uh,

79
00:04:31.201 --> 00:04:33.060
you know, his game film for the day.

80
00:04:33.061 --> 00:04:35.280
He was planning what he was going to be talking about.

81
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.310
There was an interview with me afterwards, with little Wayne who was there.

82
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.440
So they were setting up and another part, it was kind of a surreal,

83
00:04:40.441 --> 00:04:43.110
just morning, little Wayne and all his body guards.

84
00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:44.850
And this whole kudu crew was there.

85
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.570
I'm there with one person setting up our three cameras and we're like, Hey,

86
00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:51.660
you know, and I was just like, this is surreal.

87
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.490
And about an hour, about 15 minutes before interview.

88
00:04:56.491 --> 00:05:00.780
So for another hour we're half the lights are off in this room and now people

89
00:05:00.781 --> 00:05:03.810
starting to come in around eight 30 in the, in the office. And so there's some,

90
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.260
there's some activity happening and I'm sitting there in the chair,

91
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:09.630
just kind of waiting, just trying to like be ready.

92
00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:12.090
I don't know if he's going to come out early. Is he coming out on time?

93
00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:12.990
I don't know what's happening.

94
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.570
He ends up coming out probably two minutes before eight o'clock the start time.

95
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.580
And the publicist gave me a,

96
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.620
a bunch of papers of everything,

97
00:05:25.621 --> 00:05:30.150
not to ask him a list of things you can not talk about from his past or his

98
00:05:30.151 --> 00:05:32.820
parents to all these things. Like don't mention this, don't mention this.

99
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.710
I mean a list I've never had this before.

100
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.370
And so I know to myself,

101
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.750
I've got two minutes to connect with. Arguably the greatest of all time,

102
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.540
who's just won an Oscar as well, by the way.

103
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.400
And two minutes to connect before our 20 minute interview,

104
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.270
right? What am I going to say? And hopefully he doesn't, you know,

105
00:05:54.271 --> 00:05:57.380
when you meet people that are really famous and you're inspired by then you meet

106
00:05:57.381 --> 00:05:59.480
them and you're like, gosh, I'm really let down by them. They.

107
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.040
<v 2>Say, never meet your heroes. Right?</v>

108
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.940
<v 0>And this guy was a complete opposite. He was right away,</v>

109
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:07.490
came up to me and gave me a big handshake and was just like, Hey,

110
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.860
thank you so much for being here really means a lot to me.

111
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:11.870
We're trying to get the message out about our podcast.

112
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:14.630
Like thank you for taking the time. Look me in the eyes.

113
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.290
First thing I said to him was like, I just want to say, thank you.

114
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:20.930
I work with our I'm friends with a lot of Olympians.

115
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.990
And all of them say that during the last couple of Olympics,

116
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.260
you were the most giving athlete that you would show up to,

117
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.100
to other sporting events that you would take photos with everyone in the,

118
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.851
you know,

119
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:35.480
in the village and during lunches that you were just so kind and giving.

120
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:37.790
So as a, as a USA handball player,

121
00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:42.020
I want to thank you for how you show up during this times. And right away,

122
00:06:42.021 --> 00:06:46.040
he goes, you play handball. And I go, yeah, I love handball. And he goes,

123
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.040
I love handball playing it in Italy, growing up.

124
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.970
That's all I did as a F as a fun activity. And I go amazing. Yeah,

125
00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:57.170
it's such a great sport. I wish we had it here, the USA more. And then, um,

126
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.790
I mentioned a couple of people we had in common and he's like, man,

127
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.980
those guys are my brothers. Like, I love that.

128
00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:07.670
I'm glad we have some good connections. And I said, one more thing. I said,

129
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.320
you know, your, your team has told me what not to share and what not talk about,

130
00:07:12.321 --> 00:07:15.890
is there anything else off limits that I shouldn't talk about? And he said,

131
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.640
rip that up, ask me anything you want and take as long as you want.

132
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.040
So I was only supposed to have 20 minutes.

133
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.700
We have to think we went 40 to 45 and I tried to be respectful because the

134
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.210
publicist kept saying, like wrap it up in the background. And I was like, okay,

135
00:07:29.211 --> 00:07:30.080
let me be respectful.

136
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:34.190
But even the last few questions he answered and we was talking about like his

137
00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:39.080
whole mission was to tell great stories and him talking about love and

138
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.100
family. For me, it was really inspiring. Not only the words he says,

139
00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:44.180
but his example,

140
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:49.340
he isn't just saying work hard and outwork everyone he's actually showed me as

141
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:51.490
an example. I didn't know if he was going to,

142
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.010
if he was going to see me seeing him that morning,

143
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.700
like he didn't think I was going to walk past his office cause I wasn't supposed

144
00:07:58.701 --> 00:08:02.090
to. But he was there. Just that example of,

145
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:06.350
I don't get to my place 30 minutes before my interviews. Right. You,

146
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.480
I guess, I mean, you come in when you're ready,

147
00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:13.220
but it's like just that example of hard work is shows why he was so

148
00:08:13.221 --> 00:08:14.630
great. And that was inspiring to me.

149
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:16.720
<v 2>Isn't it interesting that, you know,</v>

150
00:08:16.721 --> 00:08:19.600
they say the same thing about Michael Jordan. He outworked everybody. He,

151
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.840
he practiced the hardest, like you'd think that every athlete would be like, Oh,

152
00:08:22.841 --> 00:08:24.340
that's the obvious way to do it.

153
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.950
Or forget athletes that all of us in our lives would be like, Oh,

154
00:08:26.951 --> 00:08:29.860
you want to be the best at what you do. You got to work the hardest.

155
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.830
You've got to show up first and you got to leave the last and blah, blah, blah.

156
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.090
And yet 99.9, nine, nine, 9% of us. Don't do it.

157
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.890
Even though you look at the guys that you admire most and they're the ones

158
00:08:41.891 --> 00:08:42.724
doing it.

159
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:46.270
<v 0>It's a big sacrifice is a lot of time. And a lot of energy in you.</v>

160
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.540
You have to give up so much to go all in on one thing.

161
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.470
So I know why it's hard to do. I mean, it's like he was up at four,

162
00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:56.460
am working out with his daughter and then he at the office at five 30 or

163
00:08:56.461 --> 00:09:00.150
whatever it was or six or whatever it was. And it's like, it's a sacrifice.

164
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:05.040
We'd much rather be comfortable and sleep more and watch Netflix

165
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:09.810
more. I like watching Netflix. It's it's not easy to be great.

166
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.670
It's very challenging. The commitment that consistency over time.

167
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.640
And that's one of the things Colby studies just like, it's simple math.

168
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.090
I just put in double the hours as everyone else. When I was a teenager,

169
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:24.300
it's the first year he started playing basketball at a summer camp.

170
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.900
He didn't score one point in this whole, like summer. Uh,

171
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.530
and this tournament that he played in and then he started doing double the hours

172
00:09:31.531 --> 00:09:34.070
and the next year he was like the highest score. And he was like,

173
00:09:34.071 --> 00:09:38.580
it was simple math. I wasn't more talented. I simply put in more hours.

174
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.330
<v 2>It's a good transition to something else that he said that I think is</v>

175
00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:42.650
interesting where he talked,

176
00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.040
you were asking him about when he was sort of hitting his stride.

177
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:50.360
And he talks about this moment where Shaq is injured for like eight games that

178
00:09:50.361 --> 00:09:53.510
he scored, I think 40, over 40 and eight straight games or something like that.

179
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:57.500
And then Phil Jackson calls him into the office when Shaq comes back and

180
00:09:57.501 --> 00:09:58.580
basically is like,

181
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.710
now you got to tone it down because now Shaq is back and the East plays

182
00:10:03.711 --> 00:10:06.470
different. So when we get to the finals, we're going to do this differently.

183
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.130
And he, you know, you'd think that he would just be like, no, we're,

184
00:10:10.131 --> 00:10:14.570
we're winning like crazy. I'm better than shackle. We don't even need shack.

185
00:10:14.571 --> 00:10:17.660
You know, they had their own problems later, but, but he basically was like,

186
00:10:17.661 --> 00:10:20.870
yeah. So I listened to the, to the mentor. That's what I wanted to get to.

187
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.530
Cause you talk a lot about mentorship. He listened to the mentor in this case,

188
00:10:24.531 --> 00:10:27.980
Phil Jackson, who had already done this with Jordan and he dialed it back.

189
00:10:27.981 --> 00:10:30.020
And then of course they ended up winning a championship.

190
00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.690
