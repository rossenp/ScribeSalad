00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.940
<v 0>Something that I think few people appreciate is that when you use a hand</v>

2
00:00:02.941 --> 00:00:05.820
sanitizer, before you go shopping,

3
00:00:05.821 --> 00:00:07.410
and then you touch the store register receipt,

4
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.320
these store register receipts are actually coded with bisphenol a,

5
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.190
which is a pretty potent endocrine disruptor that hand sanitizer,

6
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:15.690
when you use it just before,

7
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:18.450
or even just after you touched these receipts that actually dramatically,

8
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:23.040
by at least an order of magnitude increases the permeability of your skin to

9
00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:23.874
these compounds.

10
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.540
<v 1>I'm noticing now at whole foods,</v>

11
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:32.390
just because we're in the midst of this odd thing with Corona virus,

12
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.400
that nobody, at least at my whole foods,

13
00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:37.820
nobody's touching the grains that you can do yourself. You know,

14
00:00:37.821 --> 00:00:40.190
they've got that wall of grains. It's like,

15
00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:41.810
nobody's even going over there anymore,

16
00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:45.320
which is probably I guess good at the moment, but you know, who does?

17
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.430
<v 0>Yeah. A lot of people are now using these hand sanitizers. If you like,</v>

18
00:00:49.431 --> 00:00:53.720
go on Amazon, it's there, the markup has just shot up exponentially.

19
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.890
Um, but something that I think few people appreciate is that when you use a hand

20
00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.770
sanitizer, before you go shopping,

21
00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:02.330
and then you touch the store register receipt,

22
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.270
the store register receipts are actually coded with bisphenol a,

23
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.110
which is a pretty potent endocrine disruptor that hand sanitizer,

24
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:10.640
when you use it just before,

25
00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:13.370
or even just after you touched these receipts that actually dramatically,

26
00:01:13.371 --> 00:01:16.670
by at least an order of magnitude increases, um,

27
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.780
the permeability of your skin to these compounds. So you want to be you,

28
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.380
I don't know.

29
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.250
<v 1>Well, that's incredible.</v>

30
00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:24.980
They were literally selling hand sanitizer at the register.

31
00:01:24.981 --> 00:01:28.250
You probably people are buying it right then and there you put it on,

32
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.600
you grab the receipt now. Okay.

33
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.110
<v 0>Yeah. It's not good. Um, that's actually a big topic that I cover in, uh,</v>

34
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.880
in the new book is, um, endocrine disruption and environmental toxins without,

35
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.940
uh, trying to fearmonger, but just to kind of alert people, um,

36
00:01:42.941 --> 00:01:45.950
and to get people to think a little bit more critically about, uh,

37
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.350
the industrial chemicals to which they are routinely exposed.

38
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.000
<v 1>All right. So before we go fully there,</v>

39
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.380
I want to tell you what my basic diet is on a day like today,

40
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.150
where I told you right before we sat this last time,

41
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.520
we didn't do this last time. And I think I was doing pretty good,

42
00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:00.850
but on a day like today, I'm having, I have a crazy day. I have,

43
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.090
I told you I have two shoots.

44
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.400
Then I have three other shows and we're doing a live stream.

45
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.910
Like I'm going to be just crazed all day long. So this morning, uh,

46
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.230
all I've had so far today, it's about 10:00 AM right now. I had a cup of coffee.

47
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.000
You know, I grind the beans myself, do that.

48
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.220
I put a scoop of collagen protein in there and a half teaspoon of lion's

49
00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:21.860
mane mushroom, which is good for the brain, as they say,

50
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.300
I've had that one cup and I've had, um, about, uh,

51
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.830
three quarters of a cup of oatmeal with a little almond milk and a tiny bit of

52
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.770
sugar-free syrup. And that's going to get me to lunch.

53
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.970
How am I doing in the morning?

54
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.100
<v 0>It sounds pretty good. Pretty good.</v>

55
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.570
<v 1>It's just it's college in proteins. So it's like maybe 18 grams of protein.</v>

56
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.960
Something like that is not. Yeah. Talk to me about college.

57
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.110
This is LA everybody's obsessed with college and you can't go anywhere with

58
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.380
that.

59
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.480
<v 0>I'm actually a fan of college. College is one of the few,</v>

60
00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:54.710
especially today where we tend to eat for the omnivores in the audience.

61
00:02:54.711 --> 00:02:55.970
We tend to eat mostly muscle meat,

62
00:02:55.971 --> 00:03:00.010
which is concentrated in an amino acid called methionine an essential amino

63
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:00.430
acid.

64
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.840
But there is thinking that by consuming too much methianine without adequate

65
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:05.471
glycine,

66
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:09.460
which is an amino acid that is found predominantly in collagenous tissue and

67
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:11.950
also in college and protein. It's about one third of one,

68
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:16.240
third of collagen protein is glycine. Um, that that might be to our detriment.

69
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:17.620
So especially for an omnivore,

70
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:20.890
I think supplementing with college and protein is actually a pretty good idea.

71
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.740
Um, so.

72
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.010
<v 1>So coffee with a little college and protein and some of the mushroom powder I'm</v>

73
00:03:26.011 --> 00:03:27.060
doing okay in the morning.

74
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.580
<v 0>Fan of, of lion's mane as well. I use, uh, you know, the lion's mane powder.</v>

75
00:03:32.581 --> 00:03:36.750
I think it's, um, they've the studies on lion's mane. It,

76
00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:40.590
it can potentially boost, uh, nerve growth factor. And I've seen,

77
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.160
there was a clinical trial performed in Japan where it's been used to, uh, they,

78
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.330
they, what they observed was a,

79
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:49.860
a boost in cognitive function in patients with mild cognitive impairment. So,

80
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.130
um, you know, I'm a fan of these, uh,

81
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.200
these like quote unquote medicinal mushrooms.

82
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.840
There's not a ton of research on them, but.

83
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.560
<v 1>Right. And then oatmeal, little sugar-free syrup I'm doing okay. Yeah. Oatmeal.</v>

84
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:02.543
So common milk.

85
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.560
<v 0>It's a little for me,</v>

86
00:04:04.561 --> 00:04:07.680
it's a little high-glycemic to have first thing in the morning, but, uh,

87
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.670
oatmeal, you know, it's a great source of soluble fiber it's satiating. Um,

88
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.750
you've got these beta glucans in it, which are immunomodulatory. Um, so yeah,

89
00:04:15.751 --> 00:04:19.110
I think oatmeal is a steel cut is generally the best it's going to have the

90
00:04:19.111 --> 00:04:19.710
lowest.

91
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:20.880
<v 1>They're still cutting. You can confirm,</v>

92
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.440
you can confirm when you walk out of here. Okay.

93
00:04:22.441 --> 00:04:25.020
So then I'll have two shows and then I'm going to have lunch.

94
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.910
I think they placed the order already.

95
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.630
We're doing like sweet greens or tender greens, like a Chipotle,

96
00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:34.230
a chicken salad romaine. There's probably a little cheese in there.

97
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.123
I'm a big fan of them.

98
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.500
<v 0>But I, I eat what's called a big fatty salad every day.</v>

99
00:04:37.501 --> 00:04:40.020
I feel like I might've talked about this the last time I was here, but yeah,

100
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.750
researchers at rush university, actually one of the research, one of the, the,

101
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.910
the lead author in a lot of the studies that I use, um,

102
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.720
that I cite in, in my, in my books, in my, and in my talks,

103
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.130
Martha Clare, Morris, she just passed away of a soft GL cancer. Um,

104
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.200
she is the originator of the mind diet,

105
00:04:58.201 --> 00:05:02.490
and she also has done a lot of the epidemiology surrounding, um, you know,

106
00:05:02.491 --> 00:05:04.890
risk factors for cognitive decline. And what she found,

107
00:05:04.891 --> 00:05:09.720
what her team found is that the consumption of a big salad every day about a cup

108
00:05:09.721 --> 00:05:13.110
and a third of dark leafy greens is associated with brains that perform up to 11

109
00:05:13.111 --> 00:05:16.110
years younger. So yeah, I mean, there's probably a strong,

110
00:05:16.111 --> 00:05:20.430
healthy user bias there too. Um, people who eat more greens, more whole grains,

111
00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:24.030
things like that tend to be more health conscious, but, uh, you know,

112
00:05:24.031 --> 00:05:27.300
we know that dark leafy greens are good for us. They contain carotinoids,

113
00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:30.600
which are really beneficial for iHealth, for brain health. Okay.

114
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.000
<v 1>You can eat a lot of spinach really quick,</v>

115
00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.180
cause you can put a whole handful of it. And once it cooks down,

116
00:05:36.181 --> 00:05:37.860
it's like three bites and you're good.

117
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.430
<v 0>Yeah. Spinach. Yeah. I'm a fan of dark leafy greens. I mean,</v>

118
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.450
we live in this weird contentious time in,

119
00:05:44.451 --> 00:05:48.270
in nutrition where we've got these different factions, like breaking off,

120
00:05:48.271 --> 00:05:51.390
we've got the vegans, we've got the carnivores. Um, and so I, you know,

121
00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:54.300
I actually have a pretty balanced message. I think I, uh,

122
00:05:54.301 --> 00:05:59.030
I'm a strong advocate of the consumption of animal foods, grass fed beef,

123
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.470
fatty fish, things like that. Um, but then also, yeah, dark leafy greens, kale,

124
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:04.304
spinach, arugula.

125
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.250
<v 1>So speaking of the carnivores, you know,</v>

126
00:06:06.251 --> 00:06:09.850
I was on tour with Jordan Peterson and he became famous or infamous for

127
00:06:09.851 --> 00:06:11.470
partaking in the carnivore diet,

128
00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:16.060
which I think his daughter Mikayla has now called the lion lion, the lion diet,

129
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.190
which is quite literally only beef. I mean, and I was on tour with this guy.

130
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.010
He ate rib-eyes for breakfast. We'd have,

131
00:06:24.011 --> 00:06:27.160
he'd often have to revise for lunch and sometimes a whole time Hawk at night,

132
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.910
or maybe two more, rib-eyes little salty at some club soda, water, that's it,

133
00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:33.280
people kept asking me that this can't be true. And I was like,

134
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.550
if he is secretly eating cookies in his hotel room, I don't know about it.

135
00:06:36.551 --> 00:06:39.220
But from what I know, uh, he was keeping to it. And,

136
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.180
and I did see throughout the year that we were together on the road,

137
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.130
that he actually, his skin started looking better.

138
00:06:45.131 --> 00:06:48.730
He said it fixed some stuff related to like oral hygiene.

139
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.540
And that I thought his hair looked even like a little thicker or something. Wow.

140
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.300
Um, do you, have you studied this at all? Do you sense, uh,

141
00:06:57.301 --> 00:06:59.890
an imbalance there, but not about him specifically,

142
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.590
but just generally like when, when people do these,

143
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.860
what are seemingly sort of extreme versions? What you're talking about?

144
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.510
<v 0>I think meat is, is very nutrient dense. Um, you know, there's certain,</v>

145
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.510
I think people in the carnivore community, um, you know,

146
00:07:13.511 --> 00:07:16.510
there's some debate about whether or not they're getting adequate amounts of

147
00:07:16.511 --> 00:07:19.810
vitamin C or even optimal amounts of vitamin C, um,

148
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.210
which is found predominantly in, in, you can get it in,

149
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.320
you can get small amounts of vitamin C and fresh liver, raw, fresh liver,

150
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.320
but you got to eat raw, fresh liver to get it right for a carnivore, right.

151
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.900
<v 1>By the way, I should mention that in the midst of all this, he took,</v>

152
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.900
he had a physical for some insurance stuff and it's all his numbers.

153
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.600
He told me he came back fine. So just that in that way.

154
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.030
<v 0>No, I think that meat is very healthy. Like I'm not, you know,</v>

155
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.930
I think that there's a lot of confusion about the value of meat in a healthful

156
00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:48.460
diet, in an environmentally friendly diet, um, or way of eating, I should say.

157
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.900
But, uh, but yeah, no, I'm a big, I'm a big advocate. I think a lot of people,

158
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:56.710
the people that I see tend to do best on the carnivore diet, because it's a,

159
00:07:56.711 --> 00:07:59.320
it's a very extreme elimination diet is essentially what it is.

160
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:00.580
And it's also a very safe,

161
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.210
it's very hard to over-consume meat because protein is the most satiating

162
00:08:04.211 --> 00:08:07.270
macronutrient. It's going to be more satiating than fat.

163
00:08:07.271 --> 00:08:10.270
It's gonna be more satiating than carbs. So it's very difficult to overeat meat.

164
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:11.920
Um, so a lot of people,

165
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.050
what you'll see is they're going to end up losing weight.

166
00:08:14.051 --> 00:08:14.950
And when you lose weight,

167
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:19.870
a lot of biomarkers that we associate with ill health tend to get

168
00:08:19.871 --> 00:08:22.900
fixed, you know, high blood, you know, if you have high blood pressure,

169
00:08:22.901 --> 00:08:24.880
it's gonna go down when you lose weight, um,

170
00:08:24.881 --> 00:08:26.410
inflammatory markers and things like that.

171
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.520
So just losing weight is going to help you if you, if you are overweight. Um,

172
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.940
but also people with, uh, with inflammatory conditions,

173
00:08:33.941 --> 00:08:38.110
with autoimmune conditions, what I've observed and in my conversations with,

174
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:39.550
uh,

175
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:42.490
people who are advocates of the carnivore diet and also medical doctors who are

176
00:08:42.491 --> 00:08:47.320
advocates of the carnivore diet, um, that you're removing problematic compounds,

177
00:08:47.321 --> 00:08:48.220
you know, uh,

178
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.480
plant-based compounds that can be allergenic for some people that can

179
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.860
induce, uh, you know, a form of mimicry,

180
00:08:55.861 --> 00:08:59.220
which can aggravate an already confused immune system and cause an autoimmune

181
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:03.240
response in some people. So, um, that being said,

182
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:06.310
do I think that people need to, that, you know, it's, uh, it's,

183
00:09:06.311 --> 00:09:08.190
it's a very difficult diet to adhere to.

184
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:12.300
And if I were still suffering from some kind of autoimmune condition,

185
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.620
I would probably give it a shot, but then I would try to reintegrate. I mean,

186
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.320
elimination diets are not meant to be, um, you know,

187
00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:22.440
adhere to long-term you're supposed to like cut everything out and then

188
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:26.370
reintegrate one by one, um, you know,

189
00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:29.070
these different food groups so that you can see what the actual source of your

190
00:09:29.071 --> 00:09:32.910
problems is. Right. Um, so yeah, I don't know. I mean,

191
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:34.110
I've never tried it personally, but.

192
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.100
<v 1>Yeah. Can we talk about the anti-inflammatory thing for a little bit?</v>

193
00:09:37.101 --> 00:09:39.080
So I don't remember last time I had you on,

194
00:09:39.081 --> 00:09:42.050
which I think maybe is like a year and a half ago or so. Um,

195
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.180
I don't even know if I had talked about it publicly yet, but, uh,

196
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.370
a couple of years back, about five years ago,

197
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.160
I was getting my hair cut and my girl,

198
00:09:49.161 --> 00:09:51.980
she told me that I was missing some chunks of hair.

199
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.410
And then it started spreading basically all over my head.

200
00:09:54.411 --> 00:09:58.610
And at one point I had lost literally like 40% of my hair and I was doing like,

201
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.250
create ha I told you about this, even, even privately,

202
00:10:01.251 --> 00:10:04.280
maybe I don't even remember if it was private or on the show, but anyway,

203
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.820
I was doing like crazy spray on stuff to be on camera and all this other stuff.

204
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.320
And I was doing steroids and then I went on some experimental stuff and I had a

205
00:10:12.321 --> 00:10:13.910
really horrible reaction to that.

206
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.660
The one thing that started turning it around for me was when I started doing

207
00:10:17.661 --> 00:10:21.320
more of a paleo diet, which I'm still doing, not fully,

208
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.380
I'm doing more of like a slow carb thing, but really just to,

209
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.590
to do the anti-inflammatory thing. And I've seen a change. I mean,

210
00:10:27.591 --> 00:10:30.680
I've lost weight. I feel better, even the little things,

211
00:10:30.681 --> 00:10:33.560
old basketball injuries that don't hurt as much. Um,

212
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:36.530
can you just talk about the inflammatory situation,

213
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.050
why you don't want to be inflamed all the time.

214
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.090
<v 0>Chronic low grade inflammation to a forest fire occurring in the body.</v>

215
00:10:44.091 --> 00:10:48.140
And I mean, my focus, the brain sits directly downwind of that fire,

216
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.680
unfortunately, and inflammation is not a bad thing. Like, you know, it's a,

217
00:10:51.681 --> 00:10:55.670
it's a life saving function of our immune systems and it's really designed by

218
00:10:55.671 --> 00:10:59.630
nature to spot clean cuts, wounds, scrapes, bruises, um,

219
00:10:59.631 --> 00:11:03.080
and you can feel it if you've ever sprained an ankle, the area gets, you know,

220
00:11:03.081 --> 00:11:07.730
it gets hot, it starts swelling, you know, um, will engorge with blood.

221
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:11.780
And, uh, the same thing happens when you, um, you know,

222
00:11:11.781 --> 00:11:15.110
if you have an infection like in, you know, in your body, you become inflamed.

223
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:19.790
And the problem today, I think is that,

224
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:25.460
uh, our immune systems are responding not to what they would have,

225
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:26.840
you know, for our ancestors,

226
00:11:26.841 --> 00:11:28.880
but they're responding more to our diets and our lifestyle.

227
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.930
