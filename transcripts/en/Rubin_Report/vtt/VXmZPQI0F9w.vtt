1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.070
<v 0>Well, I think something really, uh,</v>

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.540
big that's different is Donald Trump because in 2016 he was running as an

3
00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:10.680
outsider. He said, look, I don't have 50 years of political baggage.

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.680
I'm not paying back favors. I'm an outsider, I'm a businessman.

5
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:17.520
I know how to balance a budget. I know how to cut spending. And I know how to,

6
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.610
you know, get, get stuff done basically, and I'll bring the troops home.

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.650
And so that's why the polls got it wrong because people voted for him who had

8
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:27.840
never voted or who hadn't voted for 20 years.

9
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.790
And so now it's four years later and we can see that he's

10
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:36.780
acted pretty much like all the professional politicians that he's increased.

11
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:40.710
The deficit he's increased the debt, uh, still has some brought the troops home.

12
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.000
So now I think that maybe people will say, you know, uh,

13
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.040
maybe Republicans are beyond hope.

14
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.170
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

15
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.870
<v 2>Rubin report. As always guys,</v>

16
00:00:56.871 --> 00:01:01.520
don't forget to subscribe to our channel and click that pesky notification bell.

17
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.590
And joining me today is a senior lecturer in psychology at Clemson university

18
00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:10.370
and libertarian presidential candidate, Joe Jorgensen,

19
00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:15.260
welcome to the Rubin report. Oh, so glad to be here. Thanks for having me. Well,

20
00:01:15.261 --> 00:01:16.430
I'm thrilled to have you,

21
00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:19.940
and I know for sure that my audience is thrilled to have you because I've

22
00:01:19.941 --> 00:01:24.680
received roughly 4 billion tweets saying why haven't you had Joe

23
00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:27.320
Jorgensen on? So for the record, uh,

24
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.100
we have been trying to make this happen for a while and we finally,

25
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.840
finally did make it happen.

26
00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:36.890
We weren't avoiding you and you were not avoiding us. Is that fair to say.

27
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.850
<v 0>It just, you just couldn't catch up to the bus back there chasing my bus.</v>

28
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.310
<v 2>You got a powered, we've got a super powered bus over there. Okay.</v>

29
00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:50.000
So there's a lot of stuff that I want to talk to you about. And I think,

30
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:50.331
you know,

31
00:01:50.331 --> 00:01:55.010
a bit about my sort of political evolution and probably most of my political

32
00:01:55.011 --> 00:01:56.260
stances. You,

33
00:01:56.261 --> 00:01:59.870
you may not know that I actually did vote for the libertarian candidate in the

34
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:04.260
last election. I did vote for Gary Johnson. I had Gary Johnson on my show. I,

35
00:02:04.261 --> 00:02:08.450
I liked Gary Johnson. Um, I don't think he was, you know,

36
00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:13.160
the strongest libertarian candidate in a year that there was a moment

37
00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:14.810
for it. Um,

38
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.800
so I guess my first question that'll probably set up everything else is

39
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.080
if it didn't work in 2016, when so many people were frustrated,

40
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.990
what is different this time? What,

41
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:29.150
why should the libertarians have hoped this time?

42
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.270
<v 0>I think something really, uh,</v>

43
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.740
big that's different is Donald Trump because in 2016 he was running as an

44
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:40.910
outsider. He said, look, I don't have 50 years of political baggage.

45
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.880
I'm not paying back favors. I'm an outsider, I'm a businessman.

46
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.720
I know how to balance a budget. I know how to cut spending. And I know how to,

47
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.810
you know, get, get stuff done basically. And I'll bring the troops home.

48
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.850
And so that's why the polls got it wrong because people voted for him who had

49
00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:58.070
never voted or who hadn't voted for 20 years.

50
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.010
And so now it's four years later and we can see that he's

51
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:07.000
acted pretty much like all the professional politicians that he's increased.

52
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:10.930
The deficit he's increased the debt, uh, still hasn't brought the troops home.

53
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.220
So now I think that maybe people will say, you know, uh,

54
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.940
maybe Republicans are beyond hope. Now libertarians have known that, uh,

55
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.640
Republicans are beyond hope since 1971.

56
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.600
And that's why the party was formed after Richard Nixon stopped acting like a

57
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:29.110
Republican, but maybe now the Republican voters. And let me say,

58
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:32.260
there are many fine Republican voters who want smaller government,

59
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.530
it's Republican politicians who aren't giving it to them.

60
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.570
And so maybe after having an outsider come in a businessman who supposedly can

61
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:44.830
balance a budget, maybe they'll say, you know, it's time for a real outsider.

62
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.490
<v 2>So what would you say to the conservatives or the Republicans who want smaller</v>

63
00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:53.640
government? They want lower taxes and they're looking and they're going, okay.

64
00:03:53.641 --> 00:03:56.880
Trump did cut some taxes. He got rid of some regulation.

65
00:03:56.881 --> 00:03:59.430
We're clearly not going into other Wars at the moment.

66
00:03:59.431 --> 00:04:03.060
We're bringing troops home that are basically looking at that stuff and going,

67
00:04:03.061 --> 00:04:07.440
Hey, Trump did give us a bunch of the stuff that th that we want. Yes.

68
00:04:07.441 --> 00:04:11.100
Is the budget going up? Yeah. But the budgets are the deficit going up. Yeah.

69
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.610
But it always seems to go up. Do you think he's done anything right.

70
00:04:14.611 --> 00:04:16.020
From a libertarian perspective.

71
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.320
<v 0>He has cut some regulations. However,</v>

72
00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:24.270
I'd like to point out that a tax cut is also going to

73
00:04:24.271 --> 00:04:28.470
be possibly an increase in spending if they don't do anything to make that up.

74
00:04:28.471 --> 00:04:31.530
So, uh, again, he, the, the bottom.

75
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.840
<v 2>Line either way. Yeah, yeah.</v>

76
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.220
<v 0>Exactly. The bottom line is spending's going up and that's what counts.</v>

77
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.340
Even if we're not paying for it this year would be paying for it next year,

78
00:04:41.341 --> 00:04:44.640
10 years from now, 20 years from now. And that's, that's what matters.

79
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.190
<v 2>Are you constantly amazed as a libertarian that telling people we want</v>

80
00:04:50.191 --> 00:04:54.990
you to keep more of your money is not more of a winning

81
00:04:54.991 --> 00:04:57.570
ticket. I mean, I think when people really hear it,

82
00:04:57.571 --> 00:05:00.480
if you bash them over the head with it over and over and over again,

83
00:05:00.481 --> 00:05:04.170
and you're like, yeah, we want you to have your money. Not them.

84
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.770
I think they do get it, but it seems like it's such an easy sale. And yet,

85
00:05:07.771 --> 00:05:11.490
for some reason, people just don't understand it or, or don't absorb it.

86
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.111
<v 0>Yes. Well,</v>

87
00:05:13.111 --> 00:05:17.160
what really frustrates me are people like bill Gates or Oprah Winfrey who say,

88
00:05:17.161 --> 00:05:20.580
yeah, the government doesn't take enough of my money. You know, text me more.

89
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.770
But look at what bill Gates does.

90
00:05:22.771 --> 00:05:26.670
He starts the bill and Melinda Gates foundation, uh, does, you know,

91
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.710
good work and, uh, Oprah Winfrey opens up her own school right over in Africa.

92
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.060
Well, if they think that the government can do a better job than they can,

93
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.430
why are they starting their own foundations?

94
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.970
Why not simply turn all of that money over to the federal government?

95
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.760
And so I think that actions speak louder than words.

96
00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:47.580
And if even they aren't turning their money over,

97
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.820
I think that that just sent a message to everybody else that, Hey,

98
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.320
the government doesn't do a good job.

99
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.160
I can't think of much that the government does a better job than the private

100
00:05:56.161 --> 00:05:56.880
sector.

101
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.400
And think that bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey and all these other liberals who

102
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:04.670
want bigger government, I think that they're just proving our point for us.

103
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.130
So what do you think.

104
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.920
<v 2>I think is going on in their heads there? Is it, is it just,</v>

105
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:13.900
is it misguidedness or is it guilt or is it that they know

106
00:06:13.901 --> 00:06:17.620
that the, the machine and the media will like them more?

107
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:18.880
If they take these pictures.

108
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.430
<v 0>I'm hoping it's ignorance. The true sense of the word ignorance.</v>

109
00:06:24.431 --> 00:06:27.580
Because a lot of people just don't understand how things work.

110
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.360
And that's one of the biggest compliments that I get from people, uh, just,

111
00:06:31.361 --> 00:06:34.000
you know, non libertarian friends after they meet me, they say, you know what?

112
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.500
I read the news differently. Now I look at things differently. Now they don't,

113
00:06:38.501 --> 00:06:41.890
you know, for instance, yeah, we cut taxes. Okay. What about spending? Uh,

114
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.760
so you can look at things in a superficial way and think things are going great

115
00:06:45.761 --> 00:06:50.290
without, you know, the understanding or the underlying what's going on, uh,

116
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.153
beneath at all.

117
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.780
Does the thing that frustrates you the most.

118
00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.790
<v 2>Anything to do with the sort of simplistic way we look at politics where,</v>

119
00:07:00.791 --> 00:07:01.091
you know,

120
00:07:01.091 --> 00:07:04.480
half of the country seems to think that if you tell them they're getting

121
00:07:04.481 --> 00:07:07.600
something for free, they seem to think it actually is free.

122
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.130
And combating that notion is almost impossible. You say free healthcare,

123
00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:16.450
you say free education, you know, free money now, literally free money.

124
00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:20.470
It's like that combating. Oh, but you do have to pay for it.

125
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.230
That's just not what we do publicly very well.

126
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.850
<v 0>Yes. I would have thought that with the Obama phone, remember those,</v>

127
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.080
I know basically what Obama was going to reach into his back pocket and buy

128
00:07:32.081 --> 00:07:32.980
everybody a phone.

129
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.490
And that's what I've been telling everybody about these $1,200 checks that

130
00:07:36.491 --> 00:07:39.580
they're getting is that money is coming from somewhere.

131
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.890
And I know that, you know,

132
00:07:41.891 --> 00:07:45.430
supposedly there was a hold up because Donald Trump wanted his name written on

133
00:07:45.431 --> 00:07:47.320
the actual check. Well,

134
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.400
I don't think that that check is coming from his back pocket or his private

135
00:07:51.401 --> 00:07:56.130
checking account it's coming from us. So somehow they give us money and, and,

136
00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.100
and make it, you know, make it seem like it's a Santa Claus or something.

137
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.720
But what's frustrating is that they take our

138
00:08:04.721 --> 00:08:09.640
taxes out our income taxes so that we get a tax refund

139
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.260
every year after April. And so looks like we're getting something.

140
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.140
And I wish they had never started that practice.

141
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.880
I don't think we'd be where we are now.

142
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:23.620
If people actually had the head to feel the pain and right now people feel the

143
00:08:23.621 --> 00:08:26.410
pain when they're teenagers, and then they quickly forget, you know,

144
00:08:26.411 --> 00:08:28.870
so many times I hear about somebody, uh, you know, a,

145
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.320
friend's a kid who goes to work and like, wait a minute,

146
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.490
I worked 20 hours this week. W w where's this money going? And it's like, well,

147
00:08:36.491 --> 00:08:39.520
welcome to the world of being an adult, welcome to the world of taxes.

148
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.640
And so it feels painful then, but by the time you're 30,

149
00:08:42.641 --> 00:08:46.060
40 years old and it's grown and grown, you've kind of forgotten about it.

150
00:08:46.061 --> 00:08:47.380
So if you're looking for more.

151
00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.860
