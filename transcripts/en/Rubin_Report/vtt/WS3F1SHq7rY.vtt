00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.550
<v 0>I have to say, and,</v>

2
00:00:01.551 --> 00:00:06.360
and it would be absurd to me if I lost my relationship with my boyfriend

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.160
over politics, I think that would be absurd yet. It's come close.

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.880
It's come close at times. Certainly the summer of 2018,

5
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:17.850
when everything looked like it was blowing up and the Kavanaugh hearings were

6
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.730
happening and we were on separate sides of the,

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.630
I thought the counter hearings were a joke, a complete joke.

8
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.690
He thought she was a hero heroin,

9
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.190
a heroin that I thought was insane.

10
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.750
<v 2>Since you told me that no nothing's off topic and you already brought them up.</v>

11
00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:48.260
So you mentioned, so your, your part, you say partner, I said, partner,

12
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:50.390
you say partner. That always reminds me. My boyfriend,

13
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.960
boyfriend partner always seems like you're playing tennis boyfriend playing golf

14
00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:55.610
or something. Or he was a boy.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.570
<v 0>For two years. And now it's been going on 11. He's a partner now. Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.280
<v 2>So he moved it to partner he's partner. Fair enough. So, um, no, my husband,</v>

17
00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:07.010
so he's a Bernie guy and obviously, obviously you're not.

18
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.220
And I think that's super interesting. We had dinner one night, the four of us.

19
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:12.290
And I think it were interesting because.

20
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.300
<v 0>I get a whole lot of email from people that are breaking up over this</v>

21
00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:17.900
kind of thing.

22
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.800
<v 2>Right. Talking to marriages.</v>

23
00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:22.730
I have had people email me that they have had divorces or in the midst of a

24
00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:26.780
divorce because of this. You guys can somehow work past that.

25
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.100
I think look because Paul.

26
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.720
<v 0>All it takes are not the be all end all.</v>

27
00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:31.880
Even though many people might feel that way in,

28
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:36.020
in this crazy environment and atmosphere that we're living in.

29
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.900
I won't allow it. I simply won't allow it.

30
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.230
And I don't think he will allow it either. I mean, in term,

31
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.600
because we like each other more than that.

32
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.900
<v 2>Right. But is that generally easier for, from,</v>

33
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.230
do you think someone coming from your perspective than usually the leftist

34
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.390
perspective, we don't have to make this about your boyfriend,

35
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.640
specifically your partner, but you know what I mean?

36
00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:59.090
Like I find people that are coming from it from a more, it's all politics.

37
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.930
Isn't everything perspective can let a lot of stuff go versus, Oh yeah.

38
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.720
A lot of lefties, they think politics is everything, right?

39
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.840
They believe that this thing is everything.

40
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.710
<v 0>Look I am of that, of that, of that demo.</v>

41
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.370
I will not let politics destroy a relationship and I will not let it destroy a

42
00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:17.510
friendship at all.

43
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:20.900
I had dinner last night with three friends who are on the right or conservative.

44
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.820
I'm having dinner tomorrow night with three friends who are Democrat and heavily

45
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.523
so-called liberals.

46
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.270
I moved through both worlds and I will never define a friend or not have a

47
00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:34.790
friend based on what their politics are. I simply won't do it. I won't,

48
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.990
disinvite someone based on their politics. It's absurd though.

49
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:40.550
Of course this has happened.

50
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:42.980
And it's happened to me through this book and through my podcast,

51
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.760
even though I am not a vocal Trump supporter and I,

52
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.360
what I do is I I've been criticized in the media and I've been criticizing

53
00:02:50.361 --> 00:02:51.920
people who have been losing their minds over Trump.

54
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.040
That gets you disinvited from a lot of stuff. So that'd be.

55
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.410
<v 2>You mean, you're talking about as well. You didn't even vote for Trump,</v>

56
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.270
but so much of the is related to this. Yeah. It's not enough.

57
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.200
<v 0>You have to call your face off. You have to call your face off. But anyway,</v>

58
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.760
I have to say, and,

59
00:03:05.761 --> 00:03:10.530
and it would be absurd to me if I lost my relationship with my boyfriend

60
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.360
over politics, I think that would be absurd yet. It's come close.

61
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.080
It's come close at times. Certainly the summer of 2018,

62
00:03:19.081 --> 00:03:22.020
when everything looked like it was blowing up and the Kavanaugh hearings were

63
00:03:22.021 --> 00:03:24.960
happening and we were on separate sides of the aisle.

64
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.830
I thought the council hearings were a joke, a complete joke.

65
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.890
He thought she was a hero heroin,

66
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.360
a heroin that I thought was insane.

67
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.250
I thought it was absolutely insane. And so we did get to a couple of,

68
00:03:41.251 --> 00:03:44.820
you know, whisper screaming arguments. And in pavilions.

69
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.490
<v 2>You know, it was just nuts.</v>

70
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.670
<v 0>And I w I could barely drive the car because we're screaming at each other over</v>

71
00:03:50.671 --> 00:03:54.810
this. And I couldn't believe how fast it would come on. It wasn't a slow burn.

72
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.840
It would, it would go one to a hundred and like five seconds.

73
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.210
And you're screaming at each other over this.

74
00:04:00.211 --> 00:04:04.080
You cannot believe I one person at the same time, you know,

75
00:04:04.081 --> 00:04:09.030
you take a deep breath and you realize, what is this about? What is this about?

76
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.320
And I will say, I am the more mature one. I don't say anything anymore.

77
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.230
I just keep it closed. I may look it up and say,

78
00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:19.710
you're the more mature he was saying some things about Bernie, about Trump,

79
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.630
but just like, Oh, well, maybe, you know, so I I'm I'm, uh,

80
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.430
but I can't imagine, uh,

81
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.570
letting politics to fund not only my love life or my friendships. Yeah.

82
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.380
Not going to happen.

83
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.000
<v 2>So all the people that when they've gone crazy,</v>

84
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:36.330
one of the guys who help frame some of this for me, do you know, Michael malice,

85
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.840
by any chance, he's an interesting guy. You'd like a lot. He's a,

86
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.720
he's really sort of a, he's even a first, he's not even a libertarian.

87
00:04:42.721 --> 00:04:45.240
He's more of like an end cap. You know, no government, he likes,

88
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.090
he likes kind of chaos. I call them the Willy Wonka politics.

89
00:04:48.091 --> 00:04:51.150
He's just kind of out there really, really interesting thinker,

90
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.500
but he loves the tumble that we're in right now where I think my default is a

91
00:04:55.501 --> 00:04:59.340
little more, if everyone could just calm down a little bit better.

92
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.450
But I would imagine though, also as a writer and generally as a creative person,

93
00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:05.400
it's like, you kind of have to like it a little bit.

94
00:05:05.401 --> 00:05:07.050
If you're gonna be able to get anything done, right.

95
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.070
Like if you were hating this entire thing right now,

96
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.370
do you think you could be creative through?

97
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.100
<v 0>I actually do hate a lot of it. I really do hit a lot of it. And I,</v>

98
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.110
and it's not, it's not, again, the side that elected Trump that I hate,

99
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.920
I really do hate what's become of the other side of the aisle.

100
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.720
That's really my problem.

101
00:05:27.721 --> 00:05:32.520
And that's what makes me so sad and depresses me all the time is that, uh,

102
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.090
there is this complete absence of,

103
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.980
of connection of wanting to connect and wanting to STEM this divide

104
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.420
that's happening winning to men,

105
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.650
men something. And I do think that the media is at fault.

106
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.270
A huge part of it is a fault.

107
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.880
I don't think brushing bots are there to blame for anything.

108
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.940
The media must be blamed for really sowing the seeds of dis uh, discord.

109
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.310
And the fact that my friends on the left can not speak to somebody

110
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:06.890
often on the right is a problem.

111
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.300
I think there was some poll taken where 92% of people on the right would have

112
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.680
liberal over 8% of liberals would have a conservative or whatever that is.

113
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.460
I really do see that I see that around LA and I see that around, uh,

114
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.630
the people that I know in New York that, that actually makes me depressed.

115
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.070
That is a depressing thing.

116
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:28.400
It doesn't make me happy to be alive or to be a writer. Um,

117
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.880
and a lot of what I'm writing right now really has nothing to do with any of

118
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:33.740
this. I'm writing a novel that said in 1980,

119
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.650
I am writing another novel that's based on an intellectual property.

120
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:40.070
So I don't know if there's anything about this beard that I necessarily want to

121
00:06:40.071 --> 00:06:43.550
write, write about. I do think that it is kind of a very depressing,

122
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.770
stressful period to a degree I'm a lot older. So I kind of let it go off,

123
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.900
run off me, but you know,

124
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.550
there is stress floating around everywhere. Yeah.

125
00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.370
<v 2>Are you surprised how it's worldwide now that it feels it's not just, you know,</v>

126
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:01.630
little LA bubble.

127
00:07:01.631 --> 00:07:04.530
It's not just a little American thing that it seems to be everywhere.

128
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.190
<v 0>Well, look, I was surprised that this book, uh,</v>

129
00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.540
was being published in as many countries as it was because it's

130
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.930
nonfiction. And it seems to be specifically about the United States.

131
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.290
And what's been going on in the last five or 10 years here, culturally,

132
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.260
politically to a degree. But, um,

133
00:07:23.261 --> 00:07:27.880
I did two tours of France for this book because they see the same thing kind of

134
00:07:27.881 --> 00:07:29.080
happening. Uh,

135
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.310
cancel culture is rearing its head political correctness to an almost

136
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.350
frightening degree. Um,

137
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:40.240
as cultural appropriation is starting to also rear its head. Uh,

138
00:07:40.241 --> 00:07:44.710
the me too movement is being weaponized in ways that go against

139
00:07:44.711 --> 00:07:48.460
whatever its initial promise was when it began.

140
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:52.980
And a lot of people were getting worried. Uh, certainly when I was tour touring,

141
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.150
uh, through Italy of all places,

142
00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:00.250
the same concerns that all of these things that we're talking about here is kind

143
00:08:00.251 --> 00:08:03.670
of sweeping alone, Europe, Belize throughout Europe.

144
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.180
And that nationalism,

145
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.030
another thing is sweeping along Europe as well, which of course drives,

146
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:15.400
you know, your average liberal, quite insane. He says, yeah,

147
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.120
but look, but, but also, I mean, what is being recorded? I mean,

148
00:08:19.121 --> 00:08:24.010
what is being recorded or reported? I mean, you know, the,

149
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:28.960
uh, elections in Israel napping the last few days, getting, hear cricket,

150
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:33.910
if about anything, about anything. Right.

151
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.320
And it seems, I mean,

152
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.920
and the way the headlines were in the New York times and the LA times were,

153
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:43.270
might be, looks like it instead of like, you know,

154
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.120
decisively saying that this has happened. So I don't know. I mean,

155
00:08:46.121 --> 00:08:49.330
I think we're in a very weird place in terms of how we're getting our

156
00:08:49.331 --> 00:08:52.570
information and how we're getting information from everywhere.

157
00:08:52.571 --> 00:08:56.370
So like you're saying yes, around the world, this,

158
00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:58.860
whatever this might be, yeah. It's happening.

159
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.760
<v 2>Do you think maybe we're starting to enter a time when we won't need</v>

160
00:09:01.761 --> 00:09:03.530
institutions the way we needed them.

161
00:09:03.531 --> 00:09:06.140
So you mentioned the New York times and CNN before these things,

162
00:09:06.141 --> 00:09:08.690
that core pillars that we all believed in,

163
00:09:08.691 --> 00:09:12.950
and maybe that's part of why younger people are just like, eh, screw all this.

164
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:13.250
Yes.

165
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:17.270
<v 0>And it's almost becoming niche. I'm seeing so much drop away from me.</v>

166
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.900
So much stuff that I used to believe in that I used to watch that I used to read

167
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:26.000
just dropping away from me because of really most of the time I kind of

168
00:09:26.001 --> 00:09:29.330
bias that I smell and I can't deal with.

169
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:34.280
So I find a lot of that, uh, just dropping away from me. So, yes.

170
00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.090
Do you think it's a risk.

171
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:36.740
<v 2>Though, if they all crumble?</v>

172
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.850
<v 0>Uh, well, interesting. What's the risk? Well, the risk.</v>

173
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.300
<v 2>Being that if all the institutions crumbled,</v>

174
00:09:43.301 --> 00:09:48.020
the things that sort of link us to something kind of mainstream

175
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.600
that the Overton window will be so blown away,

176
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:55.850
that we're just going to have factions of people constantly warring over what

177
00:09:55.851 --> 00:09:56.960
is actually true,

178
00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.020
because there will be no institutions that are able to wrangle it out. I,

179
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:01.371
you know,

180
00:10:01.371 --> 00:10:04.220
I do think that's happening and I've started to come to belief that maybe that

181
00:10:04.221 --> 00:10:08.060
is the only alternative, but, but I do think maybe for a democracy to work,

182
00:10:08.061 --> 00:10:10.040
you still need some sort of.

183
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:14.930
<v 0>The, you think having the New York times being regulated? No,</v>

184
00:10:14.931 --> 00:10:19.370
I'm just saying the gray lady and our country is really healthy. I don't know.

185
00:10:19.371 --> 00:10:21.200
I don't either. I really don't.

186
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.620
<v 3>If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics,</v>
