1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.930
<v 0>It's a huge talking point for socialists. And here's why,</v>

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.320
because they've always been held to this standard of, well,

3
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:08.790
how are you going to pay for it?

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.430
So modern monetary theory is, well,

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.570
we'll just digitize or print the money. Well,

6
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:21.990
that sounds like old failed monetary policy,

7
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.410
but this is new. And the idea is,

8
00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:30.360
is that as long as everybody understands that we can just

9
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:32.640
print the money and if we need the money,

10
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.070
we're going to have to tax everybody to death,

11
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.990
but we're not going to need the money.

12
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.240
So we'll just make the money and then we'll spend the money and that will help

13
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:45.960
us make more money, modern monetary theory.

14
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.760
And if there's inflation, we'll use price controls. Uh,

15
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.560
and we'll also use taxes to make sure that people are buying only the things

16
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:56.850
that we want them to buy.

17
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.260
This is total control of an economy through a government,

18
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.250
through the printing of dollars. That's modern monetary theory.

19
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.050
<v 2>How afraid are you generally that we're just going to kind of keep giving away</v>

20
00:01:18.051 --> 00:01:22.910
these things that, that the time the calendar we'll keep marching and slowly,

21
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.570
yeah, we won't go in our cars. We won't leave our house.

22
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:29.390
Suddenly walking your dog will be a problem. And you'll, you know,

23
00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:33.230
it can only go in the backyard or just like the endless cascade of things that

24
00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:34.160
we can think of.

25
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.400
But I'm more worried about the things that we can't think of that they could

26
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:38.234
come for.

27
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.020
<v 0>So here's the, here's the worst part, um,</v>

28
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.170
in the book, um, arguing with socialists, uh, you have a copy there,

29
00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:53.030
open it up chapter six. Yeah. Open it up to chapter six. Okay.

30
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.370
Uh, I don't know if you, if you saw that one,

31
00:01:55.371 --> 00:02:00.320
but it's how technology and modern monetary theory can make socialism more

32
00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:04.820
dangerous than ever. Um, this is, this was,

33
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.160
this was assuming that the economic collapse would come over a

34
00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:12.920
slow long period of time, uh,

35
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.200
that the economic collapse would,

36
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.340
and joblessness would happen maybe because of technology. The,

37
00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:20.390
in that chapter,

38
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.100
I outline what happens in that situation where it's lots of

39
00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:25.934
joblessness.

40
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.560
The first thing that happens is the government needs to spend more money.

41
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.310
And so they start to print more money, um,

42
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.020
printed in the last few weeks more money.

43
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.790
Then we, uh,

44
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.500
we digitized more money than we could have printed in a year.

45
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.380
You literally could not print that.

46
00:02:48.381 --> 00:02:53.000
There's not enough trees to print the amount of money that we have just

47
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:55.670
digitized in a two or three week period.

48
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.430
<v 2>It's not about the gold anymore.</v>

49
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.240
It's not about the dollars cause we can't print them fast enough.

50
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.020
Now we're just truly in a sort of imaginary.

51
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.470
<v 0>It's. So it is called.</v>

52
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.910
It is called modern monetary theory. Have you ever heard of it, Dave?

53
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.300
I haven't man. This is a huge, no, no, no, no.

54
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.600
Most people don't know it. It's a huge talking point for socialists.

55
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.950
And here's why, because they've always been held to this standard of, well,

56
00:03:25.951 --> 00:03:27.420
how are you going to pay for it?

57
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.060
So modern monetary theory is, well,

58
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.200
we'll just digitize or print the money. Well,

59
00:03:37.201 --> 00:03:40.620
that sounds like old failed monetary policy,

60
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.040
but this is new. And the idea is,

61
00:03:44.041 --> 00:03:48.990
is that as long as everybody understands that we can just

62
00:03:48.991 --> 00:03:51.270
print the money and if we need the money,

63
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.730
we're going to have to tax everybody to death,

64
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.620
but we're not going to need the money.

65
00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.870
So we'll just make the money and then we'll spend the money and that will help

66
00:04:00.871 --> 00:04:04.590
us make more money, modern monetary theory.

67
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.390
And if there's inflation, we'll use price controls. Uh,

68
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.190
and we'll also use taxes to make sure that people are buying only the things

69
00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:15.480
that we want them to buy.

70
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.890
This is total control of an economy through a government,

71
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.910
through the printing of dollars. That's modern monetary theory.

72
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.370
The fed is doing it right now, but the UK treasury,

73
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.410
the crown just announced that they are using monitoring modern

74
00:04:34.411 --> 00:04:38.040
monetary theory. And they are actually just printing the deck.

75
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.690
They're at least admitting it. We're doing it as well. In this chapter,

76
00:04:42.691 --> 00:04:44.670
I talk about when that starts,

77
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.620
the government is going to know it needs tech and tech will

78
00:04:49.621 --> 00:04:51.390
know it needs the government.

79
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.460
And so the tech and the government will start to work together to monitor people

80
00:04:56.461 --> 00:04:59.400
because they'll need to monitor and track, et cetera, et cetera.

81
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.830
The Corona virus has made chapter six, a reality. It is.

82
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.530
You asked me, you know, how nervous are you?

83
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.780
I'm terrified that what I wrote in chapter six is happening

84
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.890
right now.

85
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.240
<v 2>Oh, okay. So there's so much there. So, so jumping from that,</v>

86
00:05:18.241 --> 00:05:22.140
which will sort of lead us further into the book. So how much of this,

87
00:05:22.141 --> 00:05:23.850
the situation that we're in right now,

88
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.130
do you think was just because our systems were collapsing in

89
00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:32.700
front of us, we were watching the media system collapse in front of us.

90
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.370
We were watching academia collapse in front of us.

91
00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:40.050
We were watching the political establishment collapse and that all of those

92
00:05:40.051 --> 00:05:40.980
collapses.

93
00:05:40.981 --> 00:05:45.150
And then you find a crisis that you can throw in the middle of that lead to this

94
00:05:45.151 --> 00:05:48.750
perfect stew where suddenly numbers don't even mean anything.

95
00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:50.850
And we have new monetary policy.

96
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.400
<v 0>Okay. So let me, let me answer it this way. You know, the,</v>

97
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.620
the Reichstag fire.

98
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.710
<v 2>Of course never let a good crisis go to waste.</v>

99
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.970
<v 0>Correct. Now the Germans said,</v>

100
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.580
let's separate this from what we know, let me give you two aspects or two,

101
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.170
two answers on this one. The German said that that fire was happening.

102
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.450
And then, uh, the, the Nazis just took advantage of it. That's one version.

103
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.190
The other version is, uh, no, they started it.

104
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.440
They wanted it to burn. Uh, and then they used that fire.

105
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.060
So I don't think, I don't think that that is what happened here.

106
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.820
I don't think anyone started this fire.

107
00:06:36.821 --> 00:06:41.440
I don't think that while I do believe that this did come from bats

108
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.090
that were, you know,

109
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.020
the specimens were collected by the Chinese and brought to that lab.

110
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.350
It was not released intentionally. It was sloppy.

111
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.770
So nobody created this crisis. Um,

112
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.400
and then it's a series of events that just spiral out of control.

113
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.740
But I do believe at some point somebody came in and went, you know,

114
00:07:02.741 --> 00:07:04.780
this whole thing is melting down. Anyway,

115
00:07:04.781 --> 00:07:08.650
this might be a good time just to pull the plug.

116
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.240
I do think that's a possibility, um, man,

117
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.540
we just have the craziest people in charge.

118
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.790
<v 2>Yeah, it's weird because we all sort of become conspiracy theories, theorists,</v>

119
00:07:21.791 --> 00:07:25.720
and then it's like, well, what's really a conspiracy, not you.

120
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.840
Cause what you're saying is it's not that it's some coordinated thing

121
00:07:28.841 --> 00:07:33.310
necessarily, but events transpire and feed off each other.

122
00:07:33.311 --> 00:07:35.560
And next thing you know, here we are.

123
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.970
<v 0>And you not only have events feed off each other,</v>

124
00:07:39.971 --> 00:07:44.350
you do have bad actors. For instance, China is now telling France,

125
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.480
we can help you out all you want, but you have to take our 5g, uh,

126
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.990
systems. We'll give you all the masks that you need,

127
00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:57.220
but we'll only sell them to you if you do. So you have bad actors doing that.

128
00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:02.070
And I do think that there are those who are in, uh,

129
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:06.970
uh, global positions, be them people, uh, uh,

130
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.700
that are, you know, in high tech or in, uh,

131
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.420
high finance or governments that do want a different system that

132
00:08:16.421 --> 00:08:19.630
don't believe in the system of the West. Uh,

133
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.380
and they would like to use an opportunity to their advantage.

134
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:28.150
I don't think it's a conspiracy theory to think that people, you know,

135
00:08:28.151 --> 00:08:31.300
actually believe don't let a crisis go to waste.

136
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:36.310
Especially since many people in positions of power have been saying it out

137
00:08:36.311 --> 00:08:39.490
loud recently. You know, if you look at what, uh,

138
00:08:39.491 --> 00:08:42.310
the Fabian socialists did in world war one,

139
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.740
we wouldn't have gone to war.

140
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.770
If there weren't a group of people that were saying,

141
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.210
this is actually going work to our advantage, um,

142
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.850
we should go to world war because we can change the world closer to our heart's

143
00:08:56.851 --> 00:09:01.410
desire. That's what they did then. And I think it,

144
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.710
it, it plays some role here.

145
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.470
<v 2>So it's interesting because all of this actually is sort of directly related to</v>

146
00:09:09.471 --> 00:09:12.590
why you're constantly arguing with socialists.

147
00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.450
But before we get into the book specifically,

148
00:09:14.451 --> 00:09:15.860
just one more thing on this generally,

149
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:21.140
what do you make of the role or the state of media right now?

150
00:09:21.141 --> 00:09:24.650
I know you and I are in agreement on just watching mainstream media collapsed

151
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.510
and in many, and in many ways it should,

152
00:09:26.511 --> 00:09:28.400
but like just in the last couple of days,

153
00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:33.290
this insane New York times story that sort of defended Biden because there's

154
00:09:33.291 --> 00:09:36.860
no evidence, even though that wasn't the standard they held Brett Kavanaugh to,

155
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:41.270
or, or a million other examples I can give lately of just, you know,

156
00:09:41.271 --> 00:09:44.060
Corona related nonsense and you know, two months ago,

157
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.570
it's not going to be a problem now they're, they're screaming, fire. I mean,

158
00:09:47.571 --> 00:09:48.650
all of this,

159
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.900
cause that's another piece of this that I think has just run Ram shot

160
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.930
basically across everybody and nobody knows who to trust right now.

161
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:03.320
<v 0>So, um, it's a crisis of trust in almost everything.</v>

162
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.830
<v 2>If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics,</v>
