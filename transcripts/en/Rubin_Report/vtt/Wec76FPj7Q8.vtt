1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.200
<v 0>It feels that way. I mean,</v>

2
00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:05.580
it really does feel as though any common bonds that we want shared are basically

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.840
disintegrating and that you're being pressured into mimicking the belief that

4
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:10.674
all those bonds are gone.

5
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.560
So even if you believe that the bonds aren't really afraid and that really,

6
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:16.170
we should have some stuff in common. If you say that out loud,

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.750
you're part of the system, you're part of the white supremacist system. Uh,

8
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.860
and this is it. It's such dangerous stuff. And as we're sitting here very,

9
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.570
in the last few hours, there was a,

10
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:28.260
there was a sort of graphic that came out from the national museum of

11
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:31.260
African-American history and culture, which is a Smithsonian Institute,

12
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.410
taxpayer funded institution by the government funded by the government.

13
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.320
And it was all about whiteness and the evils whiteness,

14
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:40.290
and among the evils of whiteness things that we've all integrated into our lives

15
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:43.740
because of the prevailing system of white supremacy or things like hard work,

16
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.400
individualism, justice, time management,

17
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.020
delayed gratification, science. I'm not kidding. This is all in the document.

18
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:54.570
These are all of these are all things that are listed as elements of white

19
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:57.990
supremacy. That must be rejected in order to move forward into a better,

20
00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.370
more progressive world.

21
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.210
<v 2>I'm Dave Rubin. And this is the Rubin report. Quick reminder,</v>

22
00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:15.110
everybody to subscribe to our YouTube channel and click that notification bell,

23
00:01:15.111 --> 00:01:15.950
especially,

24
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.140
especially on a day like today when I have a guest so dangerous

25
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.910
that we're going to get in a lot of trouble.

26
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.930
You understand the man sitting across me. That's right. It is Ben Shapiro,

27
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.640
author of the new book. How to destroy America in three easy steps.

28
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.290
Here we go again, my friend.

29
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.170
<v 0>I know, just get ready for you. You gotta, you gotta worse than I do. I mean,</v>

30
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.100
honestly, I'm okay. My people will be fine. Yeah. You're the one who pays them.

31
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.380
<v 2>Do I get it worse than you? I'm not sure.</v>

32
00:01:42.381 --> 00:01:46.940
You have a very dedicated group of people at media matters who

33
00:01:46.941 --> 00:01:51.920
sit and wait for you to nod or to move in a way

34
00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:55.430
that they can imply is white supremacist. I have a,

35
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.100
I have a bunch of anonymous anime genderless trolls on, yeah.

36
00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.720
<v 0>That's that's that's fair.</v>

37
00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:02.000
I have a full employment program going over the media matters.

38
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:04.460
I know we have at least one, maybe two people who are on us, basically.

39
00:02:04.461 --> 00:02:06.650
Full-time at daily wire. So that's, that's exciting.

40
00:02:06.651 --> 00:02:08.630
And I'm glad that we can create jobs in all sectors of the year.

41
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.370
<v 2>We are creating jobs. I think the obvious way to start this interview.</v>

42
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.000
Cause I want to focus on your book, but I, you know,

43
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:15.710
of course we have to talk about some of the things.

44
00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:18.550
I don't know if you've heard there's a pandemic and then riots have you.

45
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.810
Haven't heard of that. You're a busy guy. Um, but you know,

46
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:26.630
I titled my book, don't burn this book. And then the,

47
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.070
basically the day the book came out, every store that had the book was on fire.

48
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.860
<v 0>Right. But you didn't say don't burn the store to be.</v>

49
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.940
<v 2>I didn't say don't burn the store that, you know, how's the book.</v>

50
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.600
Now your book is called how to destroy America. Three easy steps.

51
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.260
<v 0>That how to burn your book. Yeah. That's, that's the basic gist of it.</v>

52
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.700
<v 2>But of all times America does seem like it's being destroyed right now.</v>

53
00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:50.690
And that's what you titled the book.

54
00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:53.240
And I know a little something about writing. You finished this book when,

55
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.570
how long? December. January. Okay. So actually not that, no.

56
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.981
<v 0>This is a quick, right.</v>

57
00:02:57.981 --> 00:03:01.240
So what happened is that I gone to Israel for the Jewish holidays.

58
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:04.210
I came back and I just looked around the country and I thought something is

59
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:05.890
really, really deeply wrong. I mean,

60
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:09.240
even more wrong than it has been in prior iterations. And it's,

61
00:03:09.241 --> 00:03:11.050
it's been wrong for awhile. I mean,

62
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:12.190
there've been things that have been going wrong,

63
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:14.140
which is why I wrote the previous book, right side of history,

64
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:16.660
which was the country's kind of falling apart. What do we do?

65
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.180
What common values do we hold? And then I thought, well,

66
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:23.410
we really need sort of a nation specific book about what we're supposed to be

67
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:26.260
sharing because obviously there's this widespread perception that we share

68
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:28.510
nothing. Right? The only thing that we share is an oppressive, evil,

69
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:31.600
terrible bigoted system. And so I come back from Israel,

70
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:32.980
I called up my publisher.

71
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.160
I have a two book deal with my publisher and my publisher.

72
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.710
I actually had another book that was slated to come out, uh,

73
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.210
probably at the beginning of next year. And I said,

74
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:41.590
I want to rush a book out before the election.

75
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.900
I want it to be called how to destroy America in three easy steps.

76
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.280
And I'm going to write it in the next six weeks. And they were like, do I,

77
00:03:48.281 --> 00:03:52.420
do I thank God I, I write incredibly. I used, that was actually a little moan,

78
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.230
Ben Shapiro facts. I used too many, there are many of them, but one of the,

79
00:03:56.231 --> 00:03:59.530
one of the least well-known is I was a ghost writer for many prominent figures

80
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:02.440
for probably a decade. And that's how I supplemented my income.

81
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.390
So I have something like seven or eight New York times,

82
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.540
best sellers that are not under my own name. I was a great specialist.

83
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:11.230
Publishers would come to me, there'd be some prominent figure who, you know,

84
00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:13.900
had three weeks to go until deadline. And they'd be like, okay,

85
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:15.760
well you've got one sentence. What do we do?

86
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:18.100
And so they turned me over to the book and I'd write an entire book in a month.

87
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:18.840
So that.

88
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.900
<v 2>Right.</v>

89
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.540
Can I get you to write a couple of their names on the back of that paper for me.

90
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.410
<v 0>You later, if it's not in violation by NDAs guys, but in any case, uh, it,</v>

91
00:04:27.411 --> 00:04:31.410
it was written in white heat and it was very easy to write because the structure

92
00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:33.060
of the book is very obvious.

93
00:04:33.061 --> 00:04:35.940
I mean that the basic idea is we don't go that far yet. Okay. Well,

94
00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:36.774
we'll get to it.

95
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.090
<v 2>I wrote down all six chapters. Cause I want to talk structure.</v>

96
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:43.020
I think the way you broke it down actually is super interesting. Um,

97
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.090
but before we do full book stuff,

98
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.980
let's just talk about the world as it is at the moment for just show,

99
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.620
Oh, you can curse your brains out, but, but what do you mean you're,

100
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:53.783
you're you don't curse.

101
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.790
<v 0>I know, but yeah, I do. If I, if you promise me a bleed, but then I'll curse.</v>

102
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.100
<v 2>Oh, I, yes. My people will believe it.</v>

103
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.590
I've been waiting for that for a long time Shapiro.

104
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.220
Cause I've heard you say fight off. My guys don't have to bleed my.

105
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.400
They can bleep your privately. And then you're.

106
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.260
<v 0>Well, as, you know, as you know,</v>

107
00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:16.620
there is a bit of a gap between the public persona and in private cursive

108
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.150
illusory. Cause you know what I said, that's, that's not,

109
00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.320
that's not a great shock, but yes.

110
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.560
<v 2>Okay. So yeah, let's, let's just do it for a little bit. Uh, are we?</v>

111
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:23.850
Like what the hell is that?

112
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.460
<v 0>Um, it feels that way. I mean,</v>

113
00:05:26.461 --> 00:05:30.810
it really does feel as though any common bonds that we once shared are basically

114
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.070
disintegrating and that you're being pressured into mimicking the belief that

115
00:05:35.071 --> 00:05:35.904
all those bonds are gone.

116
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.820
So even if you believe that the bonds aren't really afraid and that really,

117
00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:41.400
we should have some stuff in common. If you say that out loud,

118
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.000
you're part of the system, you're part of the white supremacist system. Uh,

119
00:05:44.001 --> 00:05:48.120
and this is it's such dangerous stuff. And as we're sitting here very,

120
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.800
in the last few hours, there was a,

121
00:05:49.801 --> 00:05:53.520
there was a sort of graphic that came out from the national museum of

122
00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:56.520
African-American history and culture, which is a Smithsonian Institute,

123
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.630
taxpayer institution by the government funded by the government.

124
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.350
And it was all about whiteness and the evils of whiteness and among the evils of

125
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:06.230
whiteness things that we've all integrated into our lives because of the

126
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:10.190
prevailing system of white supremacy or things like hard work, individualism,

127
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.570
justice, time management, delayed gratification,

128
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.270
science, I'm not kidding. This is all in the document.

129
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:19.820
These are all of these are all things that are listed as elements of white

130
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:23.210
supremacy. That must be rejected in order to move forward into a better,

131
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.450
more progressive world. And so all the things that you would think like, yeah,

132
00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:29.030
I, I feel like we should all have this in common. Like, you know, science,

133
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.690
this one, this one we should have in common, there's a whole movement to say no,

134
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:37.520
no, all of these things are outgrowths of an evil system. And that in turn is a,

135
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.230
the result of an absolutely despicable redefinition of the term

136
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.830
racism when it used to mean in, from virtually all of human history,

137
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:48.980
but certainly since the 1960s to what it means now. So in the 1960s,

138
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:52.730
racism was what we all think of racism as believing in the inferiority or

139
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:55.730
superiority of a particular racial group. Right? Very easy definition.

140
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.760
You can spot it wherever you see it, right? I mean, it's not, not hard.

141
00:06:58.761 --> 00:07:00.170
It's very easily applied definition.

142
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.680
And then there's been an attempt in the last several years to redefine racism to

143
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:08.270
mean any system that results in racial inequality is itself

144
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.030
racist. And so if you are not seeking the destruction of that system,

145
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.150
you are complicit in racism. And in order to be anti-racism,

146
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.650
you have to seek to destroy that system.

147
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.490
Every system in human history has resulted in inequality of some sort or another

148
00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:22.340
because human beings have different capacities. We make different choices.

149
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.420
<v 2>You literally tell you telling me we're not all exactly the same.</v>

150
00:07:25.421 --> 00:07:27.850
We don't have all the exact same thoughts and gifts and skills.

151
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.310
<v 0>You telling me stop being racist. Stop it, stop it.</v>

152
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.030
So the slightly different it wouldn't Kennedy specifically writes this right,

153
00:07:34.031 --> 00:07:35.020
and how to be an anti-racist.

154
00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:39.220
He says literally any system that generates racial inequality is a racist

155
00:07:39.221 --> 00:07:39.970
system.

156
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.760
And so therefore it's not like you're a bad person because you're a racist,

157
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.010
you're just a product of the system or you're upholding the system.

158
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.490
And in order for us to fight that racism, we have to fight the system itself.

159
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.130
And so anything that is part of that system,

160
00:07:51.131 --> 00:07:55.600
anything and everything that is of that system is tainted by racism and must be

161
00:07:55.601 --> 00:07:58.950
ripped down completely. And if you are complicit in the system by,

162
00:07:58.951 --> 00:08:01.840
by doing things like hard work and individualism, you're an assimilationist,

163
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:02.341
right? This is what,

164
00:08:02.341 --> 00:08:04.360
this is what everyone Kennedy says and how to be an anti-racist.

165
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:07.060
And Robin's Angela sort of mirrors this, and you're saying yourself,

166
00:08:07.061 --> 00:08:07.510
wait a second.

167
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.960
Are you closing in an awful lot of doors to black Americans and minority

168
00:08:10.961 --> 00:08:11.530
Americans?

169
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.730
Like the pathways to success in a free system are things like hard work,

170
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.030
individual effort, you know, thinking ahead, delayed gratification,

171
00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:21.880
like this is not unique to capitalism or the evil American system. Right.

172
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:26.110
<v 2>Right. But, so what are you saying about black pregnancy? It's insane. I mean,</v>

173
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.600
David Duke would write this, right. I mean, you really could. I mean,

174
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:29.380
David Duke.

175
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:34.300
<v 0>Idea that whiteness is about hard work and individual initiative and religious</v>

176
00:08:34.301 --> 00:08:35.350
adherence and families.

177
00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.970
<v 2>Yeah. That's crap. David Duke would. Right. But the.</v>

178
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.970
<v 0>I'm writing the exact same crap and understand. Yeah.</v>

179
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.200
But all those things are bad. Right.

180
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:43.510
And if we just got rid of our adherence to these systems,

181
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:45.910
well then we wouldn't really have to have standards that we hold people to.

182
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.540
And then equality would be the result. I mean, that's insanely dangerous stuff,

183
00:08:49.541 --> 00:08:54.010
but because the charge of racism is the most is the most highly charged charge

184
00:08:54.011 --> 00:08:55.090
you can make against somebody. It's the worst.

185
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.970
You can call somebody in America and for good reason,

186
00:08:56.971 --> 00:08:59.070
because that is an awful thing to be. Right.

187
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.260
And it's an awful thing to say about somebody it's an awful thing to be,

188
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:04.440
because that is such a highly loaded term.

189
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:08.520
It's so easy to cuddle people into line. All you have to do is just acquiesce.

190
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.640
All you have to do is be the person who cheers on the guillotines is the

191
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.920
guillotines chop off heads and we'll leave you alone.

192
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.380
Now we're not going to say that you're left alone forever, right?

193
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.800
That this only holds true until the time for the next year. Um, but

194
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.660
I really feel like in this situation, it's very much like the,

195
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.960
the action movie where the bad guy comes to the good guy and he's got some

196
00:09:27.961 --> 00:09:29.940
blackmail to hold over his head. And the good guy says, well,

197
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:31.440
how do I know you won't use it in the bag that goes,

198
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:34.830
you don't write that that's, that's the anti-racist movement.

199
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.070
They figure that they can call you a racist and they will hold that over your

200
00:09:38.071 --> 00:09:40.380
head until you acquiesce in all the things.

201
00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:42.090
And if you don't acquiesce in this one little thing,

202
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:45.420
then you will be ruined and you will be destroyed and you will be targeted as

203
00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:46.254
part of the opposite.

204
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.670
<v 2>If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics,</v>
