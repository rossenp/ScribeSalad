WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.941
<v 0>But we,</v>

2
00:00:00.941 --> 00:00:05.910
we have got to prepare ourselves now to be

3
00:00:05.911 --> 00:00:09.750
ready, because if you're ready now, the problems go away.

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.870
They think your sheep. I mean,

5
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.310
I asked you on a podcast with you via last time. Where's the line?

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.410
What line do you have as an individual that you say

7
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.760
I won't cross? Well, I won't go there. I mean,

8
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.280
if I said to you last summer, yeah.

9
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:32.790
They're going to tell us that we can't have Thanksgiving with our family,

10
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.690
that we have to wear a mask all the time and the president's going to make that

11
00:00:36.691 --> 00:00:40.620
mandate and they're going to shut down the economy. You and I,

12
00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:43.800
and everybody else would have said never, never.

13
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.130
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

14
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.320
<v 2>And it's interesting. I, I often think now,</v>

15
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.260
now that I've been taking some of these positions that aren't thought of as

16
00:00:57.261 --> 00:01:01.010
popular or, or okayed by mainstream or whatever,

17
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.260
that the only thing to fear is fear itself.

18
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.190
And I've been thinking about that a lot lately, that the more that I say,

19
00:01:07.191 --> 00:01:08.540
the things that I believe to be true,

20
00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:12.770
that happened to be against the mainstream things. The more I get over that,

21
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.150
because if you can get over the fear,

22
00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:17.720
then if it's true that were on a list and they're coming for us,

23
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.130
then we're on a list. And by the way, pretty much everyone's on the list.

24
00:01:22.131 --> 00:01:24.500
And that's why there's that famous thing. You know,

25
00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:26.660
they came for the Jews first. It's like, we're all,

26
00:01:26.661 --> 00:01:27.860
we're all part of this thing,

27
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.030
but it's a very strange time that you can show me some of these things,

28
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.010
founding documents from the United States documents about saving Jews

29
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.600
during world war two. And it feels like something that's kind of now.

30
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.160
<v 0>Only if people don't find their courage. Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.270
I truly believe, and this is why I think you're so powerful.

32
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.170
Courage is contagious. It is people not. Everybody's a leader.

33
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.820
Not everybody's willing to step out into danger, you know,

34
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.260
uh, not everybody's willing to lose all their friends or to whatever,

35
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.840
but when they see someone risk everything and they

36
00:02:11.841 --> 00:02:16.820
see them on a list, if you can get them early enough,

37
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.570
they'll step out. But the longer you wait,

38
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.470
the worse it gets that's Bonhoeffer was, uh,

39
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.110
a pacifist was involved in [inaudible], uh, CU

40
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.110
 how he's a pacifist. He, he said, there's nothing else we can do at this point, because it's too late. The 

41
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.110
people's

42
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.110
 hearts had turned to stone and you couldn't turn them. We have to find a way to make sure that our hearts and the hearts of everybody, we know stay soft and see people as people, not 

43
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.943
enemy.

44
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.550
<v 2>You know, when I was on tour with Jordan,</v>

45
00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:56.990
one of the things that he would bring up often,

46
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.460
because he would talk about the parallels to Nazi-ism to some of the

47
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:03.640
authoritarian movements of the day. And he would say to everyone in the crowd,

48
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:07.270
he'd say, you know, there's 3000 of you sitting out here right now.

49
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.980
And I guarantee you that every single one of you would think that you wouldn't

50
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:15.070
be a Nazi. If this was 1936 Germany.

51
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.670
And that proves probably that you would be.

52
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.340
And I always thought that that was pretty powerful,

53
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.040
that we all think we would do the unpopular thing.

54
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:26.140
We all think we would do the risky thing.

55
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:28.720
We all judge everybody by our standards of today.

56
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.970
<v 0>I'm not sure I'd stand in the end. I mean,</v>

57
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.880
a friend of mine, Marcus Trell, I said to him,

58
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.040
how do you stand torture and not break? And he said, Glen,

59
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.660
everyone breaks. Everyone breaks. He said,

60
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.300
but the ones who break the fastest and the loudest are the ones who will say,

61
00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.360
I'm never I'll stand. Oh, I'll stand because they haven't thought about it.

62
00:04:00.361 --> 00:04:03.810
It's why I wanted to bring my kids to Auschwitz. I need you to feel it.

63
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.060
So you can think about it and really look at this as a possibility.

64
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.400
And once you do that and you realize by the grace of God,

65
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.840
I'll stand, um, then you're, then you're ready.

66
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.081
But we,

67
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:25.050
we have got to prepare ourselves now to be

68
00:04:25.051 --> 00:04:28.920
ready, because if you're ready now, the problems go away.

69
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.040
They think your sheep. I mean,

70
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.450
I asked you on a podcast with you via last time. Where's the line.

71
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.580
What line do you have as an individual that you say

72
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.900
I won't cross? Well, I won't go there. I mean,

73
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.450
if I said to you last summer, yeah.

74
00:04:48.451 --> 00:04:51.960
They're going to tell us that we can't have Thanksgiving with our family,

75
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.540
that we have to wear a mask all the time.

76
00:04:54.541 --> 00:04:57.780
And the president is going to make that mandate and they're going to shut down

77
00:04:57.781 --> 00:05:01.950
the economy. You and I, and everybody else would have said never,

78
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.903
never.

79
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.930
<v 2>I would've said, you know, maybe they're right about that bad guy. Yeah. Right.</v>

80
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.150
Yeah.

81
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.310
<v 0>You would have, it's insane to think, look where we are.</v>

82
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:17.190
And now all of a sudden that's normal. It's the new normal.

83
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.870
Yeah.

84
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.240
<v 2>They get you with that phrase, the new normal, because there's,</v>

85
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.160
there's an implicit. Oh, except it, it it's implicitly. It's here.

86
00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:27.180
So you better accept it.

87
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.430
<v 0>The thing about war is war is just about changing</v>

88
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.240
leadership, borders and financial systems.

89
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.570
That's what war is really about for the people up at the top.

90
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.300
And it's usually so horrible that a society

91
00:05:45.301 --> 00:05:49.860
even great ones never go back to the way they were because

92
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.250
you're so willing to accept peace.

93
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.400
I just want to go back to normal that you never reset back to

94
00:05:58.401 --> 00:06:02.330
normal and you'll accept almost anything. Here we are.

95
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.960
Look at what we're willing to accept at this point.

96
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.100
And I know I did when they started talking about the new normal, I was like, no,

97
00:06:09.101 --> 00:06:12.350
no, no, I don't. No, no, no, no. I don't want a new normal. I want normal,

98
00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:13.184
normal.

99
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.170
<v 2>Normal. We'll be just fine. Yeah.</v>

100
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.340
<v 0>How many people now would just be happy if we just, if we had, okay,</v>

101
00:06:19.341 --> 00:06:22.610
this is a new normal, and they're going to start, you know, letting,

102
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.450
letting things back up, but it's never going to get the way it was lots.

103
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:27.403
Lots would get.

104
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.220
<v 2>Is that why you care so much about history and these things,</v>

105
00:06:30.221 --> 00:06:33.970
because you feel like it kind of grounds you to do the current events that you

106
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.740
gotta do. You gotta wake up every day. You do.

107
00:06:35.741 --> 00:06:40.000
How many hours a day to have talk? Uh, at least at least. I mean,

108
00:06:40.001 --> 00:06:42.220
that's a lot, that's a lot of air time.

109
00:06:42.221 --> 00:06:44.410
I know how much I talk and it ain't five hours a day,

110
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.350
but is that why you care so much about history?

111
00:06:47.351 --> 00:06:52.330
Because otherwise you're just sort of spinning in the, in the morass of the day.

112
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.700
<v 0>I know clearly what I'm fighting for.</v>

113
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:59.230
I know clearly what I'm fighting against and my son was

114
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.293
eight maybe.

115
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.010
And he started taking TaeKwonDo and he had to go in to get his first belt.

116
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.660
And I don't know why, but he didn't expect there to be a crowd there.

117
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.810
And, uh, when he was really young crowd,

118
00:07:13.811 --> 00:07:17.140
scared him because of the,

119
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.460
the stuff that has happened to me, that he witnessed as a little kid,

120
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:22.863
crowd scared him.

121
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.550
And he didn't want to be around crowds and he didn't want to be noticed,

122
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:32.310
you know? Um, and so we're going, and he's like, no, no, no, there's a crowd.

123
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:36.190
There's a crowd. And I'm like, Ray, it's going to be fine. It's fine.

124
00:07:36.191 --> 00:07:39.730
It's just the parents. They're just like us. We're just watching your friends.

125
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.800
No, no, no, no. And he really freaked out. So I had to take him home. Well,

126
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:48.310
the sister got us, got her belt and I'm driving home. And I'm like,

127
00:07:48.311 --> 00:07:50.140
what do I say to him?

128
00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.800
And I was quite frankly, it was a little,

129
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.920
but I didn't want to be at him because he wasn't, you know,

130
00:07:56.921 --> 00:08:00.070
he wasn't misbehaving. And, uh,

131
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.200
and we drove home and I held his hand the whole time, but we didn't really talk.

132
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:10.300
Cause I'm thinking, what do I say, pulled into the house, got into the house.

133
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:14.440
And I knew exactly what I needed to do. And I said, come into my library,

134
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.460
come on, sit down in the library. And at that time,

135
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:23.410
my whole walls were covered with artifacts and men determined to be

136
00:08:23.411 --> 00:08:27.190
free and Raul Wallenberg and the picture of the woman that he saved and a

137
00:08:27.191 --> 00:08:30.820
picture of him, all of, all of the heroes, Rosa parks,

138
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.410
everybody Winston Churchill. And we sat there on the couch. I said,

139
00:08:35.411 --> 00:08:40.090
just want you to look at the walls. And he did. And I said,

140
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.930
why do you think I have them up here? And he said,

141
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.830
because they're all heroes and they weren't afraid. And they do the thing.

142
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.720
And I said, no,

143
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:55.410
because I know each and every one of them was terrified of

144
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:59.880
doing what they knew they had to do. They were terrified,

145
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.650
but they did it.

146
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.390
That's the lesson of history.

147
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.860
They're just like you, Abraham Lincoln was not a big, tall statue.

148
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.460
He knew he was going to die. He knew it.

149
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:20.010
He did it anyway. He didn't want to, nobody. Nobody wants to.

150
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:23.610
Do you think Gandhi? Well, Gandhi may have, because he was doing the hungry,

151
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:29.060
but that was against his people. His own followers. Yeah. Was like, you want,

152
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.290
you want to be full of anger and rage. I'm not with you.

153
00:09:33.291 --> 00:09:36.920
And until my followers stop acting that way,

154
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:41.180
I'll starve myself to death. I mean, these, these people were amazing,

155
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.620
but all of them,

156
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.170
all of them had a change of heart and didn't want to do it. Um,

157
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:52.970
Bonhoeffer went, he was here in America. He escaped Germany.

158
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.540
And he went back to, he came here to America.

159
00:09:56.541 --> 00:10:01.370
He was in New York and he was so guilt-ridden that he left his people in

160
00:10:01.371 --> 00:10:03.800
this dark hour that he went back.

161
00:10:03.801 --> 00:10:08.000
I think it was on one of the last boats that went back and you could get back

162
00:10:08.001 --> 00:10:11.990
into Germany. He went back and he said to all of his pupils,

163
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.070
okay. Let's say you're an atheist. Let's say you're an atheist.

164
00:10:16.071 --> 00:10:17.300
So you really believe that.

165
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.830
But you don't have any other choice than to take somebody's life.

166
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.800
They didn't realize at the time the example,

167
00:10:24.801 --> 00:10:29.720
he was trying to get them to convince him that there's no way you

168
00:10:29.721 --> 00:10:34.100
could do that. Or to accept, convince him that. Yes, I can do that.

169
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.580
He he's involved with Von Stauffenberg.

170
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.180
He's taken to a concentration camp in the end.

171
00:10:41.181 --> 00:10:45.770
He's in a cell with a guy who took the Jews up into airplanes

172
00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:50.150
until their heads popped. He took the, he took people in,

173
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.920
covered them in ice and freezing in the cold water and all of that stuff in

174
00:10:54.921 --> 00:10:58.520
every hospital, in the world, that book from the Nazis,

175
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.090
all of those stats are in every hospital in the world.

176
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:07.160
And that's why he was sent to a concentration camp because Hitler,

177
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:10.460
he, he released all this information and Hitler said,

178
00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:12.500
what the hell are you doing? And he said,

179
00:11:12.501 --> 00:11:15.020
you know how many lives will be saved by this information? He said,

180
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.080
we're saving German lives. Not everybody's life.

181
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:21.140
He a prostitute,

182
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:25.640
double agent and Dietrich Bonhoeffer were in the same cell.

183
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.180
They were all executed four days before Hitler died.

184
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:34.670
The guy at the gallows remembers Bonhoeffer because he thanked him.

185
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:40.130
He walked up the stairs, he got there and the executioner kind of held,

186
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.610
you know, helped him up and then put the noose around his neck.

187
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.480
And Bonhoeffer looked at him and said, thank you for your kindness,

188
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.520
good guns. That's the person I want to be.

189
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.070
But not a person.

190
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.300
<v 3>You just become. That's a person you work hard to become.</v>

191
00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:01.770
