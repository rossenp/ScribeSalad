00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.350
<v 0>If you imagine, what would the world look like if everybody took that advice?</v>

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.310
Well, people making bicycles would never try to make an airplane.

3
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.990
<v 1>Stay in your channel. Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.300
<v 0>Worst advice you could ever give or ever get is stick to your day</v>

5
00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:23.420
job, stay in your channel, stay in your lane.

6
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.980
And I hear this all the time, especially when I transitioned from cartooning.

7
00:00:27.981 --> 00:00:29.000
And even before that,

8
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.090
when I tried to transition from my cubicle life to cartooning,

9
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:33.830
not a lot of support,

10
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.980
not a lot of people saw that that that would work out for me.

11
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.840
But if you imagine,

12
00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:43.550
what would the world look like if everybody took that advice? Well,

13
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.860
people making bicycles would never try to make an airplane for one Steve jobs.

14
00:00:48.861 --> 00:00:51.650
Wouldn't be inventing any companies and computers.

15
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.390
So you are right down the lane,

16
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.860
the line and people leaving their lane was all the good stuff.

17
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.020
Um, now I also tell people to build their talent stacks. I call it.

18
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.260
So if you're good at this or a few things, leave,

19
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.620
you lean a little bit and pick up a few other skills. You might get embarrassed,

20
00:01:09.621 --> 00:01:11.030
you might get tired, but boy,

21
00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:15.230
are you going to be happy when you've got combined skills that are practically a

22
00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:16.064
superpower.

23
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.890
<v 2>Add another one of those things where it just sort of depends a little bit about</v>

24
00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:19.730
how you're wired.

25
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.240
Like some people are just all in on one thing and that is how they can operate

26
00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:24.074
their best.

27
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.280
And some people are a little more designed that they can maybe change careers

28
00:01:28.281 --> 00:01:31.550
more easily, or just learn, learn what their stack is a little bit more easily.

29
00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:33.140
And some people just kind of can't do it.

30
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.600
Or are you saying that's always your job to kind of overcome it?

31
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.420
<v 0>Yeah. There's certainly a personal difference.</v>

32
00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:41.930
There are some people who just want to stay doing what they're doing and do the

33
00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:46.580
best they can. And if you're tiger woods, that's a great idea. Tell you was,

34
00:01:46.581 --> 00:01:49.970
doesn't also need to know accounting, right? Well, except, well,

35
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.691
maybe it would help him.

36
00:01:50.691 --> 00:01:54.380
Somebody else has made it as managing his money and that's never seen it. Um,

37
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.620
so you can usually tell if you're in that situation. Yeah. I,

38
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:01.880
I need to just run on this, this horse as long as I can,

39
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.720
but for most of us in just ordinary life, I mean, I,

40
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.640
I can only be a high-end cartoonist because I assembled a bunch of

41
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.650
pretty good skills that anybody could have done. I mean, I draw like a,

42
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.380
you know, a drunken monkey, I like to say, uh,

43
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.760
but it got better over time and I got better tools figured out how to do it. Um,

44
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.920
I didn't have any experience writing humor,

45
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.710
but I figured it out over time and had some business experience. So I had a, uh,

46
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.360
uh, sort of a canvas to write on. So I,

47
00:02:34.361 --> 00:02:35.360
I'm a perfect example,

48
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.180
a bunch of mediocre skills that just work pretty well together.

49
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.960
<v 2>So I want to back up to something we started with here about your career,</v>

50
00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:43.910
because it does fit sort of lose your thing.

51
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.660
The idea that a guy who I'm guessing you were probably decent at both of your

52
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.600
day jobs, when they told you probably halfway decent,

53
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.290
when you probably not totally, uh, in their election of your duties.

54
00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:56.690
Fair to say, I showed up on time. Okay. You showed up on time.

55
00:02:56.691 --> 00:03:00.640
So you were probably pretty decent at what you did. The idea that they said,

56
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:03.640
okay, well at two different jobs, you know, diversity, you're a,

57
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.310
you're a ineffective straight white male. Like we're just,

58
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.690
you're running out of room here.

59
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.080
That strikes me is like the worst sort of loser. Think of the day.

60
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:15.410
Like people have tricked everybody into thinking that that diversity matters.

61
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.080
<v 0>You know, I surprise people when I tell them that I'm not,</v>

62
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.910
I don't have a feeling about those times that you would expect. I don't feel,

63
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.830
I don't feel like society made a mistake because sometimes you need to use

64
00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:32.460
a hammer and sometimes you need to use the scalpel and you have to know the

65
00:03:32.461 --> 00:03:37.410
difference in those days when there was literally just no diversity in senior

66
00:03:37.411 --> 00:03:41.700
management of two major companies in the Bay area for the newspaper to get on

67
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.260
him about it. I think that's how it happened.

68
00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:48.030
The newspaper got them perfectly appropriate. And for them to say, look, uh,

69
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.260
this is a, this is a sledgehammer situation. And today you're the nail.

70
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.570
I remember thinking of it. It's like,

71
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.230
that's actually a pretty good societal goal. And in fact,

72
00:03:58.231 --> 00:04:01.530
we're much closer to that reality, far better diversity.

73
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.080
I think we're better off. I think it was good.

74
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.010
I just happened to be on the wrong side of the sledgehammer at that.

75
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.210
So while it was bad for me, I don't have, uh,

76
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.260
an activist opinion that it shouldn't have happened because I think it got us to

77
00:04:16.261 --> 00:04:17.094
a better place.

78
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.641
<v 2>Interesting.</v>

79
00:04:17.641 --> 00:04:21.630
But do you think that part of the problem is that we sort of take a sledgehammer

80
00:04:21.631 --> 00:04:25.380
to everything now? So I don't fully agree with the premise there, but, uh,

81
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.940
but because I just think those things are bad, no matter what it's,

82
00:04:28.941 --> 00:04:32.490
it's just too against the individual from my personal taste, but I'll, I'll,

83
00:04:32.491 --> 00:04:36.870
I'll go with you. Do you think that the problem now is that so much has changed?

84
00:04:36.871 --> 00:04:40.860
We have diversity pretty much everywhere. In many ways, it benefits you.

85
00:04:40.861 --> 00:04:43.470
And I'm not talking about diversity of thought. I'm talking about diversity of,

86
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.270
of your color and gender and the rest of it,

87
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.030
but we're still always hitting everything with a sledgehammer now.

88
00:04:48.031 --> 00:04:51.240
And we don't go in with the, with the sort of softer tools.

89
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.380
<v 0>I'm very much, um, uh,</v>

90
00:04:54.381 --> 00:04:59.040
I guess my feeling is that if you've got slavery, you need your biggest weapon,

91
00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:02.010
the civil war. If you've got no civil rights,

92
00:05:02.011 --> 00:05:05.160
then you need the civil right movement and marching in the streets smaller than

93
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.053
the nuclear weapon.

94
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.270
And I think we've gotten to the point where you're talking about things like

95
00:05:09.271 --> 00:05:12.930
institutional racism and which, in which case,

96
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.430
my preference is to teach strategy because there does

97
00:05:17.431 --> 00:05:20.760
exist, you know, some amount of bias, et cetera,

98
00:05:20.761 --> 00:05:23.230
that will affect some amount of people. But we're,

99
00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:28.110
we now live in a world where everybody can find a place where the bias works for

100
00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:28.944
them,

101
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.930
for their there's no fortune 500 company who doesn't want to hire a

102
00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:38.730
qualified woman, blackberries and gay LGBTQ,

103
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.200
you name it. They all want them.

104
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.360
If you walk in the door and you you've got the right degree, right. Experience,

105
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.240
and you say, and also you got a job.

106
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.160
So if you're not teaching strategy, instead of worrying about this one place,

107
00:05:53.161 --> 00:05:55.200
you can't get a job leave there.

108
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.760
<v 2>So how do you, how do you move then if you've succeeded using the hammer,</v>

109
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.580
it's hard to give up that hammer, right? Well.

110
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.550
<v 0>In the political terms, you know, going big is always good. You know, you,</v>

111
00:06:05.551 --> 00:06:09.130
you want to be AOC. If you're going to be the new politician, it's like,

112
00:06:09.131 --> 00:06:11.920
what's the biggest thing I can say to set everybody's hair on fire.

113
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.910
And then if I need.

114
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.250
<v 2>To back up, world's ending at 12 years, that's.</v>

115
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.860
<v 0>Pretty good. Uh, precision wise, pretty good set.</v>

116
00:06:17.861 --> 00:06:21.030
And then you shrink it back as you need it. But it's, you know,

117
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.120
I try not to try not to confuse the, uh,

118
00:06:25.121 --> 00:06:28.450
the hyperbole and the politics with what's the right tool.

119
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.030
<v 2>Right. Do you think AOC is just, uh,</v>

120
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.630
like some other version of trumps I'm like reverse version of Trump just using

121
00:06:34.631 --> 00:06:35.464
those same things.

122
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.110
<v 0>She is the real deal. So I,</v>

123
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.580
I identified her early on people who have similar backgrounds,

124
00:06:42.581 --> 00:06:47.380
Mike Cernovich, for example, uh, almost identically the same time we just said,

125
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.160
Oh, watch out for this one. This was before she was AOC.

126
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.790
She didn't even have the AOC name yet. And sure enough, she was a,

127
00:06:54.791 --> 00:06:57.370
she was like a rocket and everybody could see it. Now.

128
00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:01.660
I believe her backstory is that, um, she was selected, um,

129
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.790
in kind of a, almost an American idol.

130
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.120
<v 2>Yeah. People don't know there are YouTube videos that people can check this out.</v>

131
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.570
They like basically picked her because yeah, she ticked off all the boxes.

132
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.840
<v 0>Out of all the candidates. She was, she was the strongest one.</v>

133
00:07:13.841 --> 00:07:18.580
So we should not be surprised that she she's performed better than a random

134
00:07:18.581 --> 00:07:19.210
person.

135
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.410
<v 2>So as a guy though, that likes, or at the very least understands,</v>

136
00:07:23.411 --> 00:07:27.670
Trump's use of persuasion and go big scale back now, watching AOC do it.

137
00:07:27.671 --> 00:07:30.970
And I'm guessing you probably agree with many less of her policies.

138
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.090
Are you worried that that's all politics will become,

139
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.750
or has it already has the ship already say, Oh, is that just where we are now?

140
00:07:37.751 --> 00:07:39.130
I guess. So, first of all.

141
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:43.840
<v 0>Well, I would say, um, she, she uses hyperbole the same way Trump did.</v>

142
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.020
So when Trump was running for president and he was talking about, you know,

143
00:07:47.021 --> 00:07:50.680
rounding up 14 million illegals, I just had, that's not gonna happen.

144
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.940
So I never really took that seriously when she says we're going to die in 12

145
00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:57.100
years. I don't really take that seriously,

146
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:00.220
but are they persuading in the right direction?

147
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:04.480
Is it good to have tight border security that you can decide to open it up as

148
00:08:04.481 --> 00:08:07.120
much as you need or close it when you need to? Yes.

149
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:08.470
That would just be a good system,

150
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.900
no matter how many people you decide to let in.

151
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.090
<v 2>Right? That's like the conversation. That's a separate.</v>

152
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.850
<v 0>Question. Uh, similar with AOC,</v>

153
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.610
she's got an interest in climate change.

154
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:22.270
I think the scientists have made a case that CO2 warms things.

155
00:08:22.271 --> 00:08:24.730
I know some people watching this will disagree, but,

156
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.050
but most of the scientists say that.

157
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.550
Now there's certainly questions about the predictions and what's going to happen

158
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:33.130
to the future. And I would defer there, but she is,

159
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.460
she is moving people in a way that they weren't moved to before.

160
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.170
It probably is an issue where they have movement. Some of the crazy things.

161
00:08:41.171 --> 00:08:44.170
I think she would have to pull back if she were a national candidate.

162
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.630
<v 2>I think she would. But is there just a general danger?</v>

163
00:08:46.631 --> 00:08:50.680
We don't have to make this about her specifically that if politics just becomes

164
00:08:50.681 --> 00:08:55.150
sort of people throwing out just every theory without really knowing

165
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:57.690
behind it. So I guess I can't make that not really about her.

166
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.510
Cause I just don't think she's that bright. I mean, I just don't,

167
00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:01.740
I think she's being, you know,

168
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:05.280
they selected her and now I think she's being manipulated and they took a sort

169
00:09:05.281 --> 00:09:08.700
of pretty girl who just likes getting up there and saying anything. And,

170
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.280
and that, that strikes me is actually dangerous.

171
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.463
<v 0>Well,</v>

172
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.880
I completely disagree on her intelligence and capability

173
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.433
thought. No, I'm not saying.

174
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.180
<v 2>The ability is not good. I think she's playing a role.</v>

175
00:09:20.181 --> 00:09:22.310
So the capability is there, but the,

176
00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:26.420
I think the actual intelligence behind it, I don't think is that great.

177
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.450
Maybe I think maybe we're talking about a different type of intelligence here.

178
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.470
<v 0>Um, certainly she has the political intelligence.</v>

179
00:09:33.471 --> 00:09:36.890
She has a psychological intelligence, social intelligence,

180
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:38.960
and she's obviously, you know,

181
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:43.970
knows more than most people about the topics because of her job. But,

182
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:44.470
uh,

183
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:49.430
I would say that she's a productive part of the conversation because you need

184
00:09:49.431 --> 00:09:53.690
somebody that's strong on these big issues, like climate change so that,

185
00:09:53.691 --> 00:09:55.940
you know, you, you know, you're getting a good,

186
00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.540
a good back and forth and it meets somewhere in the sensible middle.

187
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:04.050
So I think she's a productive part of the conversation, even when I don't,

188
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:04.884
I don't agree with it.

189
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.420
<v 3>If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics,</v>
