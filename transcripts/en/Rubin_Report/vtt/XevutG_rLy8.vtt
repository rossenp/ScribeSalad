WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.410
<v 0>Well, this particular trend goes contrary to, um,</v>

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.670
the wisdom being espoused by people like, uh,

3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.740
Thornburg and AOC and the apocalyptic

4
00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:16.170
sect within the environmentalist movement.

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.620
There are a lot of smart environmentalist who are making very reasonable points,

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.890
but the apocalypse within the, uh,

7
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:27.810
the environmentalist movement are saying that we are going to lose

8
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.390
millions of people to climate change.

9
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.880
The last trend shows the number of people who die as a

10
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:38.820
result of natural disasters.

11
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.330
These are not things that humanity has any control over.

12
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:46.500
We are talking about earthquakes and tsunamis and what we have seen,

13
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.650
and I kid you not. And I urge people to go to Trent 10,

14
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.990
is that the number of fatalities due to environmental disasters or other

15
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.830
environmental disasters has declined by 99% of the last a hundred years?

16
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.530
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

17
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.380
<v 2>I think people will be able to believe this is real,</v>

18
00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:13.220
the long piece that we're actually the Wars of the,

19
00:01:13.221 --> 00:01:17.870
of the last hundred years are, are winding down in reality.

20
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.260
<v 0>Yes. Um, right now it's, it's actually quite, uh, um, um,</v>

21
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.610
strange to talk about it now,

22
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.330
because we do actually right now had a conflict between two countries and that's

23
00:01:29.331 --> 00:01:30.800
other by John. And,

24
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.560
but what's so interesting about that conflict is that the two countries

25
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.270
didn't declare war on each other. And in fact,

26
00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:45.830
I think that the last time that a country declared war on another was

27
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.380
the Korean war between, uh,

28
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.320
between the United States and North Korea.

29
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.970
And in fact, international conflict,

30
00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:59.600
which is to say to countries that declare war on each other,

31
00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:03.140
and then send armies across borders to slaughter each other citizens that has

32
00:02:03.141 --> 00:02:06.590
pretty much disappeared from the world do have,

33
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.760
we've had an uptick in recent years in, in civil Wars.

34
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.900
So pretty much all the conflicts that are happening in the world today are civil

35
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:17.480
Wars. There are no longer international conflicts. There are civil Wars,

36
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.200
and there has definitely been an uptick in civil Wars,

37
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.030
but nowhere close to the number of civil Wars that were taking place in 1970s

38
00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:30.860
and the eighties. So even though, yes, we are not at a,

39
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.240
at, at, at a historically low level of conflict,

40
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.380
we are certainly at a much level or a lower level of conflict than we were in

41
00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:42.320
the seventies and the eighties. And that's why you need the long-term data,

42
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.730
because just when you think that things are being bad and that we've lived

43
00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:49.640
through some, I don't know, five years of negative news,

44
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.480
look what was happening in the world in the seventies and eighties, compare it.

45
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.380
And you'll be happy.

46
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.810
<v 2>That brings us to trend number 10,</v>

47
00:02:56.811 --> 00:03:00.970
which is that we are living in a safer world than we have in a very,

48
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:02.050
very long time.

49
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.220
<v 0>Yes. Well, this particular trend goes contrary to, um,</v>

50
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.480
the, the wisdom being espoused by people like, uh,

51
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.140
Thornburg and AOC and, uh, the,

52
00:03:16.141 --> 00:03:19.980
the apocalyptic sect within the environmentalist movement.

53
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.430
There are a lot of smart environmentalist who are making very reasonable points,

54
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.730
but the apocalypse within the, uh,

55
00:03:26.731 --> 00:03:31.620
the environmentalist movement are saying that we are going to lose

56
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.200
millions of people to climate change.

57
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.690
The last trend shows the number of people who die as a

58
00:03:39.691 --> 00:03:42.660
result of natural disasters.

59
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.140
These are not things that humanity has any control over.

60
00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:50.310
We are talking about earthquakes and tsunamis and what we have seen,

61
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.490
and I kid you not. And I urge people to go to Trent 10,

62
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.800
is that the number of fatalities due to environmental disasters or other

63
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.850
environmental disasters has declined by 99% of the last hundred years?

64
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.500
Why would that be? One reason is that as we grow richer,

65
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.100
we are able to build more sturdy dwellings.

66
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.560
So as architecture becomes more resistant to earthquakes,

67
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.910
flooding and so forth, um, obviously fewer people die.

68
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.040
And another thing that's improved is, uh, science. Um,

69
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.140
we have satellites which are able to track the formation of a storm

70
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.460
in the Caribbean.

71
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.990
We can project its trajectory along the coast of the United States.

72
00:04:36.991 --> 00:04:41.610
We can predict its landfall within, you know, a few dozens of miles.

73
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.170
And all of that means is that we gain time to

74
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.070
prepare for storms and hurricanes and tsunamis. Well,

75
00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:53.040
I'll get to tummies in a second and therefore fewer people die,

76
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.100
even when it comes to tsunamis, what do we have now?

77
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.530
We are able to monitor the ocean for, for earthquakes,

78
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.790
which then, uh, sent information by, uh,

79
00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:09.420
sensors to the mainland of Japan saying, for example,

80
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.960
saying that 200 kilometers to the East of,

81
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.600
I don't know, Tokyo, that hasn't been yeah.

82
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.460
And you can expect at tsunami in 36 minutes.

83
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.040
And that means that a lot of people can, can,

84
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.790
can move to higher ground or can prepare or whatever. Yeah.

85
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.750
<v 2>All right. So those were the top 10 that you guys focus on in the book.</v>

86
00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.740
Now I'm going to really challenge you as an author because I am going to

87
00:05:37.741 --> 00:05:42.330
randomly flip to three more. We will finish with three more of the 78,

88
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.870
and let's see if you know what you're really talking about here. So here we go.

89
00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:48.630
All right. Trend 52,

90
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.550
rising natural gas reserves. We've actually got extra gas.

91
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.090
I know we've got a lot of wind bags out there, but we've got extra.

92
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.060
<v 0>That's right. So before I go there and actually let me say that,</v>

93
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:06.950
I don't actually know if Tokyo is on, on the Seacoast or not, but nevermind.

94
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.130
We are going to get, I'm going to get a lot of hate mail for that.

95
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.720
But when it comes to gas, what happened was, was extra ordinary.

96
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:18.350
And that is that in the last, uh, 10 to 15 years,

97
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.940
last 10 years, uh, shale fracking, uh,

98
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.570
has become much more efficient than people ever assumed.

99
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.850
And so a lot of natural gas that was trapped in rocks and you

100
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:32.900
couldn't get to it.

101
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.670
We can now get to because of superior technology

102
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.190
that people decades ago didn't have.

103
00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:45.080
And so the known reserves of natural gas are now

104
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.100
at a record level.

105
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:49.790
So in spite of the fact that we've been using natural gas for decades,

106
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.080
we now know of more reserves than ever before.

107
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.160
That has the positive effect, of course,

108
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.350
of driving down the price of natural gas. When you have natural gas,

109
00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:08.000
that is very cheap, you can then use it instead of coal generating electricity.

110
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.550
When you use it instead of coal generating electricity,

111
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.990
you are emitting fewer CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.

112
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.750
Um, so that is shale, uh, that is shell fracking. And, uh,

113
00:07:20.751 --> 00:07:22.760
we are very lucky that in the United States,

114
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.610
we are the center for some of the most innovative minds,

115
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:28.400
because this is very much an American success story.

116
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.340
<v 2>There you go. All right, I'm randomly selected here. Here we go. Uh, Oh,</v>

117
00:07:33.341 --> 00:07:34.990
41. This'll be an interesting one.

118
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.500
Nuclear arsenals are actually going down.

119
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:43.750
<v 0>Yes. So at the height of the cold war in the mid 1980s,</v>

120
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:48.490
the United States and the Soviet union had something on the order

121
00:07:48.491 --> 00:07:49.780
of, uh,

122
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.730
20,000 nuclear warheads each aimed at one another.

123
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.690
If those exploded at the same time, it would be over for civilization.

124
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:02.170
The planet would have been uninhabitable. The end.

125
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.840
What has happened since then, uh,

126
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:09.700
is that I believe we are down to about 3000 nuclear warheads per

127
00:08:09.701 --> 00:08:14.530
Soviet unit per Russia and per United States. So we have decreased, uh,

128
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.280
the amount, the number of warheads dramatically. Now,

129
00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.890
unfortunately in recent years,

130
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.400
there has been some backsliding on these international treaties,

131
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.580
which are regulating how many nuclear weapons the country can possess.

132
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.650
And it's possible that in the future, the number of weapons possessed by China,

133
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:34.150
India, United States, Russia,

134
00:08:34.151 --> 00:08:36.880
and so forth will start climbing and we should be on top of this.

135
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.770
It is a serious problem.

136
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:44.770
It is a serious problem because the knowledge that we have in terms

137
00:08:44.771 --> 00:08:49.550
of producing nuclear weapons, that cannot be unlearned, you can in a, in a,

138
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.900
uh, you know, on a shelf somewhere and hope that people will forget about it.

139
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:58.410
I think that what we should be aiming is having the scientific community,

140
00:08:59.400 --> 00:08:59.460
um,

141
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:04.440
tell us what would be the minimal number of warheads that

142
00:09:04.441 --> 00:09:08.220
could go off on earth whilst at the same time,

143
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:13.350
preserving civilization, some semblance of civilization, preserving humanity,

144
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.910
and then distribute that number of warheads or access to those numbers of false

145
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.860
warheads amongst nuclear powers.

146
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.200
So I think we should be going in the opposite direction.

147
00:09:22.201 --> 00:09:24.630
We should try to get nukes as low as possible,

148
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.740
and then have some sort of a, um, uh,

149
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.470
proportional distribution amongst great powers.

150
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.240
<v 2>That would be a hell of a meeting trying to get proportional distribution.</v>

151
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.570
<v 0>Well, that'd be four. We've done that before in the 1920s,</v>

152
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:42.350
the United States presided over, uh, the navel,

153
00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:46.460
this armament between the United States, uh, uh, France,

154
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.500
Britain and Japan, where there was a key, according to which, uh,

155
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:55.880
Naval warships, uh, juggernauts where, uh, where, uh, sorry,

156
00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:00.500
juggernauts dread notes were distributed amongst, uh, different, great powers.

157
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:04.430
And, uh, I think it was something like 10, 10, seven, seven, four, four,

158
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.480
depending on the power of the relative power of,

159
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.340
of that great power. But my point is,

160
00:10:10.341 --> 00:10:15.020
we had done this before with what was then the equivalent of a

161
00:10:15.021 --> 00:10:17.210
nuclear weapon, which was the Dreadnought.

162
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.750
<v 2>If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversation about the</v>
