WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.550
<v 0>We're in a massive process of de norming.</v>

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.260
We are unraveling every standard, uh,

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.060
in the name of racial justice. So what happened in your car?

4
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:16.560
That's, that's a product of largely of proposition 47.

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.080
Uh, one of the ballot initiatives in California that downgraded a whole bunch of

6
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:25.110
felonies, including felony theft, uh,

7
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.610
to misdemeanor status because of the problem of

8
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.610
criminal laws, having a disparate impact on my.

9
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.993
<v 1>You think it's funny.</v>

10
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.220
<v 2>That the, that the billionaires that are thought of as the good guy,</v>

11
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.650
billionaire. So, you know, bill Gates is thought of as good.

12
00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:46.100
Let's say Warren buffet is thought of as good, you know, Koch brothers, bad,

13
00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:49.640
or whoever the right ones are bad, but the ones that are thought of as good,

14
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.900
they sort of think that they can give away enough money or say enough things

15
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.590
that it will save them, but it will never save them right. In the,

16
00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:00.860
I ultimately have the base, no matter they could give away everything,

17
00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:05.510
they can destroy their fortunes and empires, and it just will never end.

18
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.070
You think they just don't realize that, or it's like,

19
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:12.470
you just have to do it no matter what, because you want to survive.

20
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.840
<v 0>Do they not realize that? Yeah, I don't, they don't really have a choice. Um,</v>

21
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.790
but they are playing with fire. I mean, they have to realize that the,

22
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.110
to the extent that they continue feeding this and Marc Benioff is just a great

23
00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:28.490
example. There he is in,

24
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.860
in San Francisco promoting this idea that the San Francisco has not done enough

25
00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:35.330
to help the homeless. And, you know,

26
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.440
we need to save the children and what not through just endless

27
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.170
bulking up of the bureaucracy,

28
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:45.800
without dealing with the profound questions of norms,

29
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:48.800
public norms of behavior, uh, you know,

30
00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:52.760
he probably thinks he can buy a exoneration, but it's just,

31
00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:57.290
it's not going to happen. Because again, it's all connected. You know,

32
00:01:57.291 --> 00:01:59.330
this the same left that is,

33
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.070
has been dominating homeless politics in San Francisco for

34
00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:06.350
decades, the coalition on homelessness,

35
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.150
they are connected to the entire woke, uh,

36
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.340
discourse, whether it's regards to illegal aliens or, uh,

37
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.780
you know, white supremacy or male toxic masculinity, it's all,

38
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.130
it's all part of the same thing.

39
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.620
<v 2>So let's shift actually towards the homeless portion of this. Cause I,</v>

40
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:29.300
I watched this morning a talk that you did about the San Francisco situation,

41
00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:32.270
which everyone knows is horrific. I've told this story a million times,

42
00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:33.830
but when I was there about a year ago,

43
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.940
I went out to dinner with a friend and we were at Morton steakhouse.

44
00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:40.520
So it's a nice street. We're on supposedly nice street.

45
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.550
Our car got broken into right outside the restaurant.

46
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.100
They stole my bag and my notebook and all this stuff.

47
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.870
And I took a picture of the broken glass and I tweeted it out and I kid you not,

48
00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:54.020
I got hundreds. If not thousands of responses,

49
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.420
basically all saying the same thing, Dave,

50
00:02:56.421 --> 00:03:00.430
what kind of idiot leaves a bag in a car in San Francisco?

51
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:04.780
Because there is such an epidemic of break-ins that they know that

52
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.610
regular people know not to leave a bag in a car. What is happening up there?

53
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.670
<v 0>Well, it's happening across the country.</v>

54
00:03:11.671 --> 00:03:14.100
We're in a massive process of de norming.

55
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.840
We are unraveling every standard, uh,

56
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.610
in the name of racial justice. So what happened in your car?

57
00:03:23.611 --> 00:03:28.110
That's, that's a product of largely of proposition 47,

58
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.630
uh, one of the ballot initiatives in California that downgraded a whole bunch of

59
00:03:33.631 --> 00:03:36.690
felonies, including felony theft, uh,

60
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.190
to misdemeanor status because of the problem of

61
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.820
criminal laws, having a disparate impact on minorities.

62
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.110
<v 2>Do you think the people that are pushing these laws that it's the road to hell</v>

63
00:03:49.111 --> 00:03:50.310
is paved with good intentions, always.

64
00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:53.550
Do you think that they really think they're doing something good,

65
00:03:53.551 --> 00:03:57.240
even though all the evidence always points to the fact that it gets worse after

66
00:03:57.241 --> 00:03:58.590
these policies are?

67
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.040
<v 0>I don't? I think I've, you've said yourself,</v>

68
00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:05.070
you're not a big fan of conspiracy theories. I'm not either. I really,

69
00:04:05.071 --> 00:04:06.420
I take people if their words,

70
00:04:06.421 --> 00:04:10.080
I think that they really do believe that the

71
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.150
overrepresentation of blacks in prison is due to criminal justice racism.

72
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.670
And that we're throwing a whole bunch of,

73
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.870
of trivial offenders in prison, which is not the case.

74
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.740
You have to work very hard to get yourself a prison sentence, most,

75
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.550
any big city you're triaged out. Uh, you know,

76
00:04:29.551 --> 00:04:31.590
if you steal somebody's car,

77
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.690
a da is going to be completely uninterested in you.

78
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:39.600
You have to steal it at gunpoint with the driver's still in to get a big city da

79
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.090
interested in actually prosecuting your case,

80
00:04:42.091 --> 00:04:46.650
as opposed to just giving you probation and sending you on your way. Uh, but no,

81
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.730
I think that they, they really do believe that, uh,

82
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.860
the criminal justice system is racist and that the way to solve that is to,

83
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.810
is to not prosecute,

84
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.010
not put people not and defang the police.

85
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.680
And of course the problem is yes,

86
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.830
there's a vast over representation of blacks in prison.

87
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.310
But the thing we should be concerned about is that blacks are victimized by

88
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.270
crime the most.

89
00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:16.590
And I go to community meetings in inner city

90
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.240
neighborhoods all the time,

91
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.070
those good law abiding Borzois residents of high crime neighborhoods,

92
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.850
beg for more police protection. Those are the voices that never get hurt.

93
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.630
<v 2>So when these policies are put in place or like in New York city,</v>

94
00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:33.720
the Blasio has now done this thing where you're allowed to jump the turnstile,

95
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.970
they will not stop you. So it's like,

96
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.120
you're basically saying to everybody that pays. Yeah. Right.

97
00:05:39.121 --> 00:05:41.880
And I lived in New York city. Most of my adult life, I never jumped a turnstile.

98
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.230
You're basically saying if you pay, you're an idiot, like why should you do it?

99
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.100
And so they're actually encouraging more and more people to not fall.

100
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.160
<v 0>I know. And AOC has as well. I mean,</v>

101
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.180
this is really for a politician to defend turnstile

102
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.450
should be, that's an impeachable offense because

103
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.330
social norms are fragile and respect for the

104
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.340
rule for the rule of law is the essence of a civilization.

105
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.990
We lose that and you get third world anarchy with everybody trying to

106
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:21.740
game the system. You know, queuing is a thing of beauty.

107
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.030
We take it for granted,

108
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.380
but for people to be able to quietly wait in line and wait their place as

109
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:31.340
opposed to trying to, you know, get to the top and just muscle,

110
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.780
everybody else out, break the rules, whatever to get ahead, that is, uh,

111
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.390
you know, has been in sort of normal condition.

112
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.550
And for respect for the rule for the law is incredibly precious.

113
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.270
And to say it doesn't matter and the police should walk on by,

114
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.770
you are playing with fire, you are on the road to anarchy.

115
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.930
<v 2>You sense that we're in a much more precarious place right now related to that</v>

116
00:06:55.931 --> 00:06:58.330
then than we've ever been, or at least, or maybe in the last,

117
00:06:58.331 --> 00:06:59.740
let's say 50 years, something like that.

118
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.260
<v 0>We have this extraordinary revolution that nobody foresaw in the 1990s</v>

119
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.270
in the eighties,

120
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:12.370
the reigning wisdom unlock enforcement itself was that

121
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.310
police could do nothing about crime.

122
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.360
That crime was a product of inequality and injustice.

123
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.890
And until you solve poverty and, and economic inequalities,

124
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.240
all the police could do would respond after the fact. So why even bother.

125
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.290
<v 2>Likewise New York city and especially times square was a drug den. When,</v>

126
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.850
when I was growing up, going into the city.

127
00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:36.940
<v 0>Because you just police were just walking by the FBI,</v>

128
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.510
publishes an annual crime report throughout the eighties,

129
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.310
they had a disclaimer saying, well,

130
00:07:42.311 --> 00:07:46.660
of course we know homicide is a social problem that the police can't solve.

131
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.070
So the nineties had this incredible

132
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:56.020
profound moment where that whole ideology of passivity

133
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.160
before social anarchy was turned on its head.

134
00:08:00.161 --> 00:08:03.940
And you had mayor Giuliani coming in Giuliani. And his good days,

135
00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:06.550
I don't know what's happened to them now. It's very depressing to me,

136
00:08:06.551 --> 00:08:08.800
but he was the great one of the greatest mayors,

137
00:08:08.801 --> 00:08:10.600
if not the greatest mayor New York ever had.

138
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.470
And his police commissioner William Bratton said, no, we are actually going to,

139
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.590
the police are going to lower crime by enforcing the law.

140
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:22.150
And we learned that enforcement matters. You change people's behavior,

141
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.550
you deter criminal offending.

142
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:29.500
And they started paying attention to those low level crimes in times square,

143
00:08:29.501 --> 00:08:31.510
the squall or the, the,

144
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.590
the turnstile jumping that graffiti the urinating in the streets.

145
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.410
And they changed public norms. And,

146
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:41.020
and the whole broken windows theory is correct.

147
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.200
And even if it doesn't prevent higher level crimes,

148
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.250
it's what people in high crime neighborhoods beg for.

149
00:08:48.251 --> 00:08:52.510
They want public order on the streets. And now that is all being thrown away.

150
00:08:52.511 --> 00:08:56.190
And again, the reason is disparate impact. So, all right. So as.

151
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.190
<v 2>Someone that deals in fact, and that's what your books have been about,</v>

152
00:08:59.191 --> 00:09:01.410
and that's why my audience digs what you do.

153
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.990
Do you ever find that sometimes facts just aren't enough to

154
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:10.980
change the discourse? So it's like, all right, well, okay.

155
00:09:10.981 --> 00:09:14.520
We could probably move on. So how do you, how do you deal with that then?

156
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.670
Because I find this to be like the most, um,

157
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.310
sort of strangest place for conservatives to be right now,

158
00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:24.630
which is that most of the facts seem to be on the conservative side of things at

159
00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:27.300
the moment. Like, it just seems to be reality right now,

160
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:31.410
but I think conservatives have a really hard time breaking through either the

161
00:09:31.411 --> 00:09:33.960
cultural part. I think that's actually really changing right now,

162
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.850
partially because of Trump. Um,

163
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.960
but sometimes facts just aren't enough, right? I mean,

164
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:41.280
I was telling you right when you sat down,

165
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:42.660
but we were talking about the homeless thing,

166
00:09:42.661 --> 00:09:44.520
the target that's a half mile from my house.

167
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:48.450
There is a massive homeless encampment, massive. I mean,

168
00:09:48.451 --> 00:09:52.470
it's like a city there now when I go to target and it's like, well, I,

169
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.280
we could talk about why some of the reasons that you just laid out are allowing

170
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.470
this to expand, but a lot of people don't want to hear that.

171
00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:00.230
<v 0>Well, you know,</v>

172
00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:04.070
this is something that you have been thinking about for much longer than I have

173
00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.860
of how do you change minds?

174
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:11.300
What is the nature of rational discourse? What is its limits?

175
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:12.800
And, you know,

176
00:10:12.801 --> 00:10:17.240
we learned from people like Jonathan Haidt that in fact reason,

177
00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:18.980
often acts as a,

178
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.780
after the fact justification for people's instinctive

179
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.910
value systems and ways of looking at the world. So, well,

180
00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:33.320
I would like to claim non ironically that I have the facts on my side.

181
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.530
And in fact, I believe that, I mean, that's what drives me.

182
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.080
And it's sort of a hatred of what I call idiocy.

183
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:44.630
I have to acknowledge that the Progressive's would say the

184
00:10:44.631 --> 00:10:45.440
same thing.

185
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.770
<v 2>If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics,</v>
