1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.130
<v 0>These people we keep hearing from, uh, who,</v>

2
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.680
uh, chase Barry Weiss out to the New York times who chase Suzanne more out

3
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:14.310
of the guardian in the UK, uh, who, uh,

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.510
who cry when they learn that a new Jordan Peterson book is going to be published

5
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:22.890
and pay their salary the next year, this is a generational thing.

6
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:27.810
And I don't know at this stage that we can see it's completely a political

7
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:28.680
movement.

8
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.900
It's some kind of counter revolution that has been going on.

9
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.180
It believes as you know,

10
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:40.500
that speech is harm and harm is not harm,

11
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.800
but silence is violence and violence is fine.

12
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.470
It has a set of mantras. And I simply think it won't stop until it,

13
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.460
it hits the reality of this light.

14
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.190
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

15
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.450
<v 0>It was to me that something very wrong has happened with your media. Uh,</v>

16
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.920
not just the broadcast media, but the print media. Uh it's it's um,

17
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.330
I don't wanna get stuck on it, but I mean, every country I know about,

18
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.650
I know the New York times and can prove that it's lying. Uh,

19
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.730
so I can't read it because any country, I don't know very much about,

20
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.090
I wouldn't, I would assume that they're lying, but I wouldn't know exactly how,

21
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.000
um, so,

22
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.450
so you've got a very deep problem in your legacy media.

23
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.290
And, uh, obviously a lot of people have been pointing that out for a long time.

24
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.750
Um, and I wonder now, if, if Trump does go, uh, those,

25
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.140
those papers and magazines will be in want of an enemy. And, uh,

26
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.400
often as you know, that's,

27
00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:50.840
that's the worst thing for a person is if they lose their enemy. Um,

28
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.700
but yeah, so we, we, we, we don't have that media from the, the, the,

29
00:01:54.701 --> 00:01:57.890
the problem we do all have, it seems to me, and you've written about this as,

30
00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.090
you know,

31
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.440
as well as anyone is that people have become very bad at listening to a contrary

32
00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:05.900
opinion. And that is,

33
00:02:05.901 --> 00:02:10.670
I think that's gonna prove to be a generational thing that there just

34
00:02:10.671 --> 00:02:15.200
is. Uh, I speak 24 hours after the news came out. Uh,

35
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.350
Jordan Peterson, as publishers in Canada, that that'd been yeah.

36
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.080
<v 2>Wailing and gnashing of teeth, actual tears.</v>

37
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.770
<v 0>At the staff meeting when some,</v>

38
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.810
some employees of, uh, paint, uh,

39
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.920
hang around half, uh, uh, the, the, the,

40
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.910
that some of the employees of penguin discovered that they were going to, uh,

41
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.140
publish another book, uh,

42
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.220
next year by a man who's actually earned them their salaries. Um.

43
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.510
<v 2>He sold probably about 7 million copies last I heard.</v>

44
00:02:44.511 --> 00:02:48.710
So he floats in many ways, the entire ability for them to,

45
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.280
to choose all these other books that aren't going to do quite as well.

46
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.841
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:57.200
It's only because of him that they can publish the sort of intersectional

48
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.270
fictional team list. Um, yeah, no, the, these, um,

49
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.680
this, these people we keep hearing from,

50
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.500
uh, who, uh, chase Barry Weiss to the New York times,

51
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.180
who chase Suzanne more out of the guardian in the UK, uh,

52
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.080
who, uh,

53
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.280
who cry when they learn that a new Jordan Peterson book is going to be published

54
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:25.630
and pay their salary the next year, this is a generational thing.

55
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:30.580
And I don't know at this stage that we can see it's completely a political

56
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:31.420
movement.

57
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.670
It's some kind of counter revolution that has been going on.

58
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.950
It believes as you know,

59
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:43.270
that speech is harm and harm is not harm,

60
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.570
but silence is violence and violence is fine.

61
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.240
It has a set of mantras. And I simply think it won't stop until it,

62
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.350
it hits the reality of this life.

63
00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.460
I don't know when that will happen. I just hope it happens very, very soon.

64
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.240
I think that everybody who cried at the meeting,

65
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:05.890
I said this this morning on social media,

66
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.340
everybody who cried at the meeting and said that they didn't want to be at the

67
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:14.080
publishing house that published John Peterson, bang Sally out next morning,

68
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:17.590
your job is advertised so many smart young men and women should be in the

69
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:19.960
publishing business and have, and have a very,

70
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:23.920
very good reason to be so and could be excellent in their chosen profession.

71
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.640
And they're not because these people who have no right to be in a publishing

72
00:04:27.641 --> 00:04:31.690
house are in it and, and clogging up and making everyone stupid.

73
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.810
And so there's the, these people that has to be fun.

74
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.240
We have to make sure that media companies and others are

75
00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:43.750
not held hostage by the stupidest youngest.

76
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.430
Most ignorant people in the room.

77
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.450
<v 2>Is the biggest problem there that these companies,</v>

78
00:04:48.451 --> 00:04:51.060
once they fall under the spell, I mean, you wrote a book about this,

79
00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:52.590
but once they fall under the spell,

80
00:04:52.591 --> 00:04:55.290
they bring in the diversity and inclusion department.

81
00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.720
Their HR department is teaching people to watch out for white supremacism and

82
00:05:00.721 --> 00:05:04.620
all of these things. Thus, they destroy their own entities.

83
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.140
I'm completely with you. And, and I run businesses.

84
00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:11.070
If I had employees that were upset with me over my decision-making goodbye,

85
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.110
goodbye, that's it. You know, but,

86
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.490
but isn't that the bigger problem that once you've let this thing in,

87
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.850
in many ways, you're, you're the people, you're the very people.

88
00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:22.110
You let the bad guys in,

89
00:05:22.111 --> 00:05:24.960
and now they're in the house running around and what can you do?

90
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.730
<v 0>Well, what you can do is to reassert your rights as an adult.</v>

91
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.950
What I see everywhere in America in particular is the

92
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.510
complete retreat of being adults. Let me give you an example.

93
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.000
I'm sure you've heard many times. I,

94
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.830
thankfully nobody has actually said it to my face or they'd have it coming to

95
00:05:46.831 --> 00:05:50.940
them. But I have heard a lot of people told in recent years,

96
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.800
educate yourself.

97
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.810
Everybody who says educate yourself in my observation

98
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.610
is without exception, the dumbest person I have seen speaking,

99
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.520
they have no right to go around being the stupidest

100
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:14.480
person in the room, telling everyone else to educate themselves.

101
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.120
They don't mean educate yourself.

102
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.040
They mean agree with me or else. Well, here's a suggestion.

103
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.570
The adults say, no, you do not know anything.

104
00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.130
You're 23.

105
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.460
You've got a totalistic view of the universe that you're going to discover quite

106
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:34.340
soon. At some point in your life is wildly wrong.

107
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.310
And you are making yourself unemployable.

108
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.080
Here is your unemployment form your jobs up through advert tomorrow.

109
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.350
That's what the adults have to do. I'm fed up by the way. You've see.

110
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.210
So CEOs and heads of companies and all sorts of things that it's ever since the

111
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:54.110
madness of crowds came out. I find they signed all up to me.

112
00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:57.260
They whisper up to me and tell me that this is what they have.

113
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.330
And I'm fed up with the whispers and the is, I'm fed up with the adults,

114
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.680
the people at the tops of their careers, all of whom are bearing down.

115
00:07:06.681 --> 00:07:09.380
It's like that video that went viral. The other day of this,

116
00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:13.580
you saw this weird LGBTQ plus kid kid thing,

117
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:20.000
and literally they're bowing down and worshiping the new

118
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.343
God thing,

119
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.880
which is the stupidest person in the room.

120
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.910
And I'm not up for the opportunity costs society that that involves. Um,

121
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.830
and I think nobody else should be either.

122
00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.480
And I'm fed up over the grass and I'm fed up conservatives grousing about it.

123
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:44.920
<v 2>This is the stuff that we've been talking about for years. So it is nice.</v>

124
00:07:44.921 --> 00:07:47.380
You, you, you, you and I, and many other people,

125
00:07:47.381 --> 00:07:50.050
we write books about these things. We, we can write columns.

126
00:07:50.051 --> 00:07:52.030
We can do shows about it and all of that stuff.

127
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.080
And then we get what I think you just said is the most frustrating part,

128
00:07:56.290 --> 00:08:00.220
which is people at companies and people in their own private lives who are just

129
00:08:00.221 --> 00:08:04.780
still simply afraid to do anything. So then they'll, Oh, Douglas,

130
00:08:04.781 --> 00:08:08.170
I loved your book, but I don't want to take a picture with you or, you know,

131
00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:11.410
something like that. Like you're, you're still too out there and too scary that,

132
00:08:11.411 --> 00:08:15.250
that in many ways is the, is the most frustrating part, don't you think?

133
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.070
<v 0>Uh, well, I think they usually love photos anyway. Yeah.</v>

134
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.930
Uh, no, they just don't want to post them on Facebook.

135
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.520
What I find is, uh,

136
00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:35.500
that they don't realize that what they

137
00:08:35.501 --> 00:08:36.334
are,

138
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:41.230
what they are bringing in is mental and moral asbestos.

139
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:47.320
They don't realize that it's toxic to everyone in the atmosphere who has to

140
00:08:47.321 --> 00:08:48.154
breathe. It.

141
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:53.260
The job of the adults is to strip the moral and mental

142
00:08:53.261 --> 00:08:56.940
asbestos from the building fast as possible.

143
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:02.520
And if that means stripping a whole load of under thirties

144
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.140
out then fine,

145
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.390
there are a lot of very smart under thirties who could fill those positions

146
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.820
and would do a great and noble a job at it.

147
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:17.250
But it is absolutely incumbent upon people as you know what I argue

148
00:09:17.251 --> 00:09:21.000
in the madness of crowds to understand that that is what we are dealing with.

149
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.360
Once you play the diversity and equity game,

150
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:29.430
you are infusing the lungs of your

151
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:32.670
employees with this asbestos,

152
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.580
and you have to get it out. Now.

153
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:39.320
<v 2>If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics,</v>
