00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.780
<v 0>Robert George,</v>

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.050
he's the moral professor of the professor of moral philosophy over at Princeton.

3
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.780
He says he uses this as this sort of thought experiment. He says, okay,

4
00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:09.870
so he'll ask his class, you're living in 1860 in Alabama.

5
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.210
Are you an abolitionist or are you pro slavery?

6
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.610
And everybody in the room that everyone says, I'm an abolitionist.

7
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.930
And then he's like, really,

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.640
really are you because I'd love for you to name these extremely unpopular

9
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:22.410
position you're taking at the risk to your life,

10
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:24.420
reputation and career right now today.

11
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.570
Like it actually risks anything because none of you can name any of them, right?

12
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:30.510
You're, you're actually going along to get along with most of your morality.

13
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.810
The example that I like to use on this is w we're living in an era where

14
00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:35.040
everybody thinks of themselves as,

15
00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:38.160
as deeply enlightened and all of this 100 years from now, all these,

16
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.170
all the statues of president Obama will come down. Why?

17
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.120
Because he ate meat a hundred years from now.

18
00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:44.640
All the statutes of president Obama will come down because there's video of him

19
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.030
at campaign rallies in Iowa, campaign stops eating a corn dog.

20
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.430
<v 2>Pause there for a second because we're dealing with this cancel culture nonsense</v>

21
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.620
right now. Do you think that there is just a certain inertia to movements,

22
00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:10.610
like cancel culture? Because of, because of all of the stuff that we started,

23
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:12.470
this conversation talking about that it's like,

24
00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:14.180
we've had this thing slowly building,

25
00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:17.660
but now it does feel like it hit the tipping point and now it's just spread

26
00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:20.540
everywhere. Do you think there's like a functional reason?

27
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.471
<v 0>Yeah. I mean,</v>

28
00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:24.380
I think that there've been decades of an attempt to rethink what rights actually

29
00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:25.790
mean. So one of the things that,

30
00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:28.790
that the left has done is in the same way that we started off by talking about

31
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:29.930
the redefinition of racism,

32
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.080
they've redefined nearly every term that we've talked about here,

33
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.870
they've redefined every element of American philosophy to mean almost the

34
00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:38.030
precise reverse of what originally was meant to me.

35
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.180
They've redefined virtually all of American history, which is what the 16,

36
00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:43.880
19 project is about. And they've redefined our culture of rights.

37
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.940
So that rights are in fact ways to oppress people, right?

38
00:01:46.941 --> 00:01:49.490
This is when we talked a little bit earlier about the rights of free speech

39
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.580
being seen as a way for the powerful to silence the powerless.

40
00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:54.350
And you see people actually saying this kind of stuff. Yeah.

41
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.071
<v 2>I mean,</v>

42
00:01:55.071 --> 00:01:59.750
this is in effect what Ray white fragility is about in effect what all of the,

43
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.080
the whole BLM platform, this is what it is about.

44
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:04.040
Like you're not just making this.

45
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.020
<v 0>No, I mean, I, and when I wrote the book,</v>

46
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.000
I didn't realize that it was gonna break into the open this way.

47
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:11.240
I really thought that honestly, when COVID hit in March, I thought, okay,

48
00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:12.800
I wrote this book to rush out before the election,

49
00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:14.930
and now it's gonna be irrelevant because it's all going to be COVID all of his

50
00:02:14.931 --> 00:02:18.200
time. And then all this stuff just broke loose in the last couple of months.

51
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.620
And I thought, wow. I mean, I'm not a prophet, but if I were that,

52
00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:24.350
that's really how it feels. I mean,

53
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.650
looking back through the book and realizing that all the arguments that I was

54
00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:30.140
making against this particular vision of America,

55
00:02:30.141 --> 00:02:31.250
which I called this integrationist,

56
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:34.070
and the reason I call it this integrationist is because I think that it really

57
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:36.050
stands for the coming apart of America.

58
00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:37.580
I think that there's a group of people who say,

59
00:02:37.581 --> 00:02:39.560
here are all the things we have in common. And as Lincoln said,

60
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.050
we have to be brothers because if we're not brothers, we're going to be enemies,

61
00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:43.370
right? That's, that's just how this is going to be.

62
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.500
The better angels of our nature had better when,

63
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.960
and we better all be on the same page or we're going to fall apart.

64
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.580
I think there's a group of people who believe that they are the sole exposers of

65
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:55.520
ultimate truth. And as the sole expositors of ultimate truth,

66
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.340
they get to club everybody else into submission.

67
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.900
And therefore all of the checks and balances should go away because they are now

68
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:05.020
the godlike leaders who know all the wisdom of the ages.

69
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:05.854
They're the best people who have ever.

70
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.500
<v 2>It's incredible that they're unbelievable are better than everyone that came.</v>

71
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.200
<v 0>Lucky people we are to be living in this time,</v>

72
00:03:13.201 --> 00:03:15.780
this time with such unbelievably special people, right?

73
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.900
We get to rip down statues of Ulysses S grant and who get to suggest that

74
00:03:18.901 --> 00:03:21.780
Abraham Lincoln was a bad man. Whereas they, they would,

75
00:03:21.781 --> 00:03:24.780
if they'd been living in 1863, they wouldn't have just been abolitionists.

76
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.210
They would have been people who are arguing for, for all and to segregation and,

77
00:03:29.211 --> 00:03:32.820
and, and complete mixing of people of different races. Like they,

78
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.770
all the principles they hold today that are good principles, right?

79
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:35.551
All those principals,

80
00:03:35.551 --> 00:03:38.760
they would have held them doubtless in 1863 with no background in any of this

81
00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:39.870
stuff. If they'd been born,

82
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.470
all of their values are sort of floating me as magically in the atmosphere and

83
00:03:43.471 --> 00:03:46.380
they internalize them and they would have been, if it wouldn't matter,

84
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.310
you could have plopped them down in Rome in, in 100 BC.

85
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.520
And they would have held exactly the same values they exist outside of time.

86
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:54.930
They exist outside of history.

87
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.060
They exist absent to any other outside influences.

88
00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.790
They're just the most incredible people who have ever lived in the history of

89
00:03:59.791 --> 00:04:00.870
humanity. Good for them.

90
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.570
And good for us that we get to live at a time of such saints.

91
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.480
<v 2>It's so interesting because I've been thinking about this a lot.</v>

92
00:04:06.481 --> 00:04:09.420
Like if you think about how fast it seems, the world is moving right now, like,

93
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.420
just think about today, versus just what we were talking about.

94
00:04:12.421 --> 00:04:15.570
Say 10 years ago in 2010, whatever the hell it was. Now,

95
00:04:15.571 --> 00:04:20.040
if you take that further back and you pop that person down in 1863,

96
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.420
and try to imagine how different the world is like people don't really just sit

97
00:04:24.421 --> 00:04:28.440
in that for a minute and realize how different it was without plumbing and

98
00:04:28.441 --> 00:04:30.720
electricity and all of those things. And yet,

99
00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:35.130
somehow their entire moral code would have been you to which they make up.

100
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.570
[inaudible].

101
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.000
<v 0>They're not standing on the shoulders of giants.</v>

102
00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:40.080
They didn't learn anything from Lincoln.

103
00:04:40.081 --> 00:04:41.760
American history has nothing to do with their positions.

104
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.050
They exist as free floating moral actors in the universe without any background

105
00:04:46.051 --> 00:04:49.680
whatsoever. They came to all of the exact right conclusions about life.

106
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.550
Simply through APR. I thinking it's, it's,

107
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:55.200
it's truly an unbelievable achievement of the human mind. I think again,

108
00:04:55.201 --> 00:04:58.020
we should, we should all feel very lucky to be in their presence. Look,

109
00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.070
of course, this is all. I mean,

110
00:04:59.071 --> 00:05:02.130
the fact is Robert George is the moral professor of professor of moral

111
00:05:02.131 --> 00:05:04.110
philosophy over at Princeton. He says,

112
00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:06.270
he uses this as this sort of thought experiment. He says, okay,

113
00:05:06.271 --> 00:05:10.740
so in Alaska's class, you're living in 1860 in Alabama, are you an abolitionist?

114
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.380
Or are you pro slavery? And everybody in the room that everyone says,

115
00:05:13.381 --> 00:05:15.420
I'm an abolitionist. And then he's like, really,

116
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.460
really are you because I love for you to name these extremely unpopular position

117
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.940
you're taking at the risk to your life, reputation and career right now today.

118
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.090
Like it actually risks anything because none of you can name any of them, right?

119
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.030
You're, you're actually going along to get along with most of your morality.

120
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.690
The example that I like to use on this is we're living in an era where everybody

121
00:05:33.691 --> 00:05:34.530
thinks of themselves as,

122
00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:37.680
as deeply enlightened and all of this a hundred years from now, all these,

123
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.690
all the statutes of president Obama will come down. Why?

124
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.640
Because he ain't made a a hundred years from now.

125
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.160
All the statutes of president Obama will come down because there's video of him

126
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.520
at campaign rallies, you know, in Iowa campaign stops eating a corn dog.

127
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.450
He had that hot dog, right. And people are going to say, w w.

128
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.360
<v 2>I'm with you on this? It's the next frontier of this lunacy.</v>

129
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.950
<v 0>And what's going to happen is it's going to be,</v>

130
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.690
there were people who back then that this was being mean to animals and you

131
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:02.750
ignored that sort of, that sort of suffering. It means animals.

132
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:05.600
It's also destroying the environment, right. It's just right, right. Yeah.

133
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:08.000
You drove a car, right? I mean, there were people who aren't driving cars.

134
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:09.800
You can't say that you were completely innocent in all of us,

135
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.660
but nobody's completely innocent in all of this.

136
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:13.700
The reason that we erect monuments to people's for the good stuff,

137
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:16.580
they did not the bad stuff they did. Um, but again,

138
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:19.700
when you think of yourself as better than any human being who has ever lived,

139
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.820
it gives you an awful lot of moral authority to rip down everything around you.

140
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.350
<v 2>So we've, we've sort of veered into chapter two here, which is,</v>

141
00:06:26.351 --> 00:06:28.210
when you talk about that disintegration,

142
00:06:28.211 --> 00:06:31.960
do you think that once something starts disintegrating at a certain rate,

143
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.920
that then it's inevitable that it will disintegrate because,

144
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.000
and that's sort of what we're.

145
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.180
I think a lot of people are feeling that right now, like, Oh my God,

146
00:06:40.181 --> 00:06:43.090
the world really has shifted. The conversation has shifted.

147
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:48.040
It feels like everything's out of control. Can it actually, you know,

148
00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:50.350
if the wave has started, can you actually turn the way?

149
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.410
<v 0>I mean, I think the only way to really turn the wave around is to refamiliarize</v>

150
00:06:53.411 --> 00:06:55.990
ourselves with principals, which is a difficult task. I mean, we've,

151
00:06:55.991 --> 00:07:00.400
we've basically assumed that freedom was in the water for 50 years,

152
00:07:00.401 --> 00:07:02.470
60 years. And it turns out freedom was not in the water.

153
00:07:02.471 --> 00:07:05.800
Kool-Aid was in the water and people have been drinking at a university campuses

154
00:07:05.801 --> 00:07:07.210
and they've been reading Howard's in for awhile.

155
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.790
And now they think they have a very sophisticated view of the world. And,

156
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.990
and so it takes some,

157
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.220
some education in American history and American philosophy to really rethink

158
00:07:15.221 --> 00:07:17.230
locate that. But that's a hard, that's a hard slog.

159
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.300
I think it's gonna be a rough time here. I don't think this is gonna,

160
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.760
I think there's this assumption on the part of liberals,

161
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.920
like good-hearted liberals who actually believe a lot of the stuff in the book,

162
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.150
cause this is not partisan right now.

163
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.240
I really believe that everything that I've said about American history and

164
00:07:28.241 --> 00:07:31.720
American culture, like rights are good. And the declaration of independence,

165
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.460
all human beings are equal before the law.

166
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.650
Like this should be pretty consensus stuff. I mean,

167
00:07:35.651 --> 00:07:38.530
this is not right left or center. I know a lot of liberals who agree with us,

168
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.380
but I think that there's this assumption that because everything is Trump

169
00:07:41.381 --> 00:07:44.560
polarized, that if Biden is elected, that all this sort of goes back to normal,

170
00:07:44.561 --> 00:07:46.180
everybody calms down, it goes away.

171
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.260
I think they are really underestimating and descendant left that sees the,

172
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.240
that sees the wave of history behind them.

173
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.240
And they also see a weak actor in JobBite and they feel like they can push them

174
00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:56.650
around. And I think they're probably right about that.

175
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:01.030
<v 2>I mean, the guy has got serious problems. It's like, that's the scandal, right?</v>

176
00:08:01.031 --> 00:08:03.700
Like, isn't that the scandal that no one will talk about the scandal,

177
00:08:03.701 --> 00:08:05.350
which is that obviously something's wrong with them.

178
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.091
<v 0>I mean, it's,</v>

179
00:08:06.091 --> 00:08:09.520
it is pretty incredible that that's considered such an out of balance opinion.

180
00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:11.440
I mean, the boy held it without any evidence.

181
00:08:11.441 --> 00:08:13.300
You're suggesting that he's on the verge of senility. I mean,

182
00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.520
I don't watch a tape of him like eight years ago and then watch a tape of him

183
00:08:15.521 --> 00:08:17.470
today. And Joe Biden was never any great shakes,

184
00:08:17.471 --> 00:08:20.350
but he looks like a different dude. I mean, and listen,

185
00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.140
you can elect them if you want. I mean, that's, that's your prerogative,

186
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.960
but recognize that there's a high likelihood,

187
00:08:25.961 --> 00:08:27.100
you're also electing as vice-president.

188
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.400
<v 2>Right. So, okay. So we,</v>

189
00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:31.480
we started talking about culture and I wanted to pause you in the middle of it

190
00:08:31.481 --> 00:08:34.480
because when we talk about culture and someone's going to say,

191
00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:36.640
you're talking about American culture, that's chapter three,

192
00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:39.040
but American culture must mean white culture.

193
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.730
That's what you really mean Shapiro is that it's about white.

194
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.480
<v 0>Culture, right? And this, this goes back to this whole anti-racist idea,</v>

195
00:08:46.481 --> 00:08:49.750
which is that rights themselves are a vestige of white supremacist system,

196
00:08:49.751 --> 00:08:52.570
which ignores all of the progress. Not only made by black people,

197
00:08:52.571 --> 00:08:55.950
but made by black people in the name of rights, in the name of rights,

198
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.580
Martin Luther King saying we ought to have the same freedoms that you all are

199
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:02.820
guaranteed. W our freedom of speech matters no less than your freedom of speech,

200
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.760
an American saying, because you're making that argument, not the argument,

201
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:06.690
the entire system is bad,

202
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.390
not the sort of early Malcolm that's argument that white people are devils.

203
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:11.010
And the entire system is garbage and all of this,

204
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.020
this stuff that he abandoned later in his career, you know,

205
00:09:13.021 --> 00:09:16.490
because you're making the actual American argument. Yeah. We'll give that.

206
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.960
We'll give that a hearing that makes it, that makes sense to us, right? I mean,

207
00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:20.940
this was the argument, again, being made by Frederick Douglas.

208
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:22.830
He wasn't saying that July 4th is bad.

209
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.780
He's saying we're not included in that promise.

210
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.490
We should be included in that promise.

211
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.630
When you invoke the deep principles of America, you are like, your,

212
00:09:29.631 --> 00:09:31.560
your movement is likely to see victory, right?

213
00:09:31.561 --> 00:09:33.660
This is the same thing that happened with, with the gay rights movement.

214
00:09:33.661 --> 00:09:34.590
The gay rights movement said, listen,

215
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.540
you guys are guaranteed freedom of association,

216
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:40.290
you're guaranteed freedom and who you love. Right? So it was a rights argument.

217
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.040
Now I may not have agreed with the application with regard to behavior, but the,

218
00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:47.850
the actual rights are with regard to marriage with the actual early argument,

219
00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:49.650
which was, everybody should basically be left alone.

220
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.900
That was a very robust argument.

221
00:09:51.901 --> 00:09:54.570
It had a lot of power behind it because most Americans went. Yeah,

222
00:09:54.571 --> 00:09:56.370
that makes sense to me. I mean, I have that kind of freedom. Why that,

223
00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:58.620
why shouldn't that guy have that kind of freedom? Like why not? Right.

224
00:09:58.621 --> 00:10:00.810
Which is a different argument than some of the arguments we're now having,

225
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.360
which had moved beyond the rubric of rights into, well,

226
00:10:03.361 --> 00:10:05.900
I can demand from you a good or service. I can write that.

227
00:10:05.901 --> 00:10:06.734
That's a bit of a different thing.

228
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.130
<v 2>We're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics</v>
