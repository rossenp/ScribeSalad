00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.523
<v 0>All right, here we go.</v>

2
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.300
<v 1>All right, everybody here we are.</v>

3
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.160
And you believe it is November for the election was

4
00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:22.610
yesterday. The election continues into today.

5
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.480
The election will continue tomorrow. The day after tomorrow,

6
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.720
the day after the day after tomorrow and in perpetuity,

7
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.040
this is our lives. We're going to live it forever now.

8
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.050
Um, there's so much to talk about and I just want to set the table.

9
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.600
Let me just set the table with you guys right now.

10
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.710
I am going to try to take a bit of a light tone today with all of this.

11
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.800
I try to give you the news in, in an easily digestible,

12
00:00:48.801 --> 00:00:52.280
somewhat pleasant format, but I'm really going to double down on that today,

13
00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:54.860
because first off, despite all of the insanity,

14
00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:59.360
and there is a hell of a lot of insanity, I am feeling pretty good about things,

15
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.520
uh, perhaps more than anything else.

16
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.740
That's so many people actually took part in the process.

17
00:01:03.741 --> 00:01:06.590
So many people care and sure.

18
00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:09.560
There's a lot of people that are trying to manipulate that process right now.

19
00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:13.880
And we got major problems ahead, but we also got it out of the way.

20
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.850
And even though it's still here, it's still sitting with us.

21
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.970
It's like we didn't finish the voting part at least for now.

22
00:01:19.971 --> 00:01:23.330
And I think that that's kind of good and life goes on and you're not going to

23
00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:27.080
believe this people. But I also do think about other things besides politics.

24
00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:30.170
And I S I suppose, and I hope that you do as well.

25
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.970
And there are more important things out there, but this is obviously important.

26
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.870
Uh, everyone's sorta going bananas. We've got the charts,

27
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.600
the updated charts here. We're going to show them to you.

28
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.570
And then I was scribbling down some things right before we started,

29
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.200
I tried to beat myself a tic TAC toe could not do it. I could not beat myself.

30
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.400
I'd take tat go. Amazing. Right. So look, you know, we're,

31
00:01:52.401 --> 00:01:55.370
I don't have the fake glasses today, uh, because I'm just,

32
00:01:55.371 --> 00:01:57.290
I'm just going straight to you. Uh,

33
00:01:57.291 --> 00:01:59.300
but we're going to talk about a lot of stuff, uh,

34
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.150
including a video that I'll get to in a second,

35
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.870
where I kind of predicted the whole, the whole thing. Uh, but before we do that,

36
00:02:05.871 --> 00:02:09.920
guys, are you looking for a new protein bar that tastes like candy? Well,

37
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:13.670
I've got one for ya. I've got the brand for you. And it's in my hand right now,

38
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.870
built bars are super tasty and coming 18 amazing flavors.

39
00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:19.100
My personal favorite is right here.

40
00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:22.430
It's the cookies and cream built bars are covered in a hundred percent chocolate

41
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:26.900
and include both nut and nut free flavors and are soft and easy to chew with the

42
00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:29.300
holidays just around the corner. It's easy to slip up,

43
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.710
which is why built bars are the perfect alternative to the pie for the health

44
00:02:33.711 --> 00:02:35.570
conscious guy. I love that for a ride.

45
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.750
I can actually lose your maintain weight while indulging into delicious treat

46
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.450
built bars are low calorie, low sugar, high protein,

47
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.990
and high fiber go to bill barr.com and use promo code Rubin,

48
00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:47.000
and you'll get 20% off your first order.

49
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.620
Use promo code Rubin for 20% off@billbar.com. Good for bar is built,

50
00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:55.820
go or built boost. And now back to me, all right.

51
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.480
So I think the main takeaway matter what happens right now is the

52
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:06.340
pollsters and the mainstream media and the media elite

53
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.600
and the New York times and the networks that they're all wrong.

54
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.710
And we really should stop listening to them. As I said last night,

55
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.830
I don't want to put these people in jail. I don't want to put them in gulags.

56
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.970
I can't say I don't want to, but I don't plan on doing it. Uh, no,

57
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:23.290
I don't want to do that.

58
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:27.100
And that is not the American way to jail your political opponents,

59
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.380
at least for now. Um,

60
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.560
but some people need to be ignored.

61
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:36.040
The people who for weeks have been telling us that this thing was going to be a

62
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.280
blowout and the margins were bigger than last time.

63
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:40.900
And they got it all wrong last time.

64
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:44.320
But this time they weren't getting it wrong. And all of these things,

65
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:47.590
they got everything wrong again, because this is way closer.

66
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.640
As a matter of fact, Trump might win. I still think that's quite likely. Um,

67
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.050
so it's way closer.

68
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.920
And even the little things about minorities and things,

69
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:59.860
things that they said could never happen actually did happen.

70
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.740
So we're going to unpack some of the numbers and we'll get into all that.

71
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.540
And I'll give you the, I'll give you the latest updates,

72
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.220
but I want to throw to a clip of something that I did on

73
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:11.140
Monday with Glenn Beck,

74
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:14.140
I was on Glenn Beck's podcast for about an hour dissecting.

75
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:17.680
Everything that we thought we could happen would end could happen in the

76
00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:21.880
election. And Glenn asked me about what could happen on election night,

77
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.100
if it was getting kind of close and, uh, dare I Pat myself on the back,

78
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.960
but let's go to the video. Well, there's so many ways to think about this,

79
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:32.561
that some of them,

80
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:36.190
I don't even want to voice because I don't want to even add energy to it.

81
00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:39.190
But one of the ones that I've been thinking about is what happens if on election

82
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:43.870
night, the, the powers that be at ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, et cetera,

83
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:45.640
let's say things are really coming in close,

84
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.550
but in the old days where it was like, Oh, it's, it's three points.

85
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.150
That actually is a lot three points towards Trump. You call it, you call it,

86
00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:55.000
we've done our due diligence. You call it. Well, what if there's,

87
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.930
I'm not saying they're sitting in a room in a dark room with evil laughter

88
00:04:58.931 --> 00:04:59.764
necessarily.

89
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.970
But the idea being that most of these people obviously are Democrats they're

90
00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:07.270
media elite. They, they don't want to give up their power.

91
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.060
Why wouldn't they be on the phone going, you know what?

92
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.330
We're actually just not going to call Florida. It's three points on Trump,

93
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.750
but we're not going to really say that or something,

94
00:05:15.751 --> 00:05:18.730
or we're just not going to call it. And then ABC doesn't call it. Then NBC,

95
00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:22.750
doesn't call it. Then CNN doesn't call it. So I'm worried about that layer.

96
00:05:22.751 --> 00:05:25.840
It's not just voter fraud in terms of the number.

97
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:31.060
It's actually the numbers translating into what the media will then communicate

98
00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:34.600
with us. I'm actually more worried about that. So we, man,

99
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:35.830
it is going to be a crazy week.

100
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.880
The guy you're listening to right there is Dave Rubin, election prediction,

101
00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:44.620
expert. Extraordinary. Yeah.

102
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.480
I don't have the fancy numbers and a team of data scientists and all of that

103
00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:53.200
stuff that Nate silver over at five 38, uh, has,

104
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:55.510
did you see that guy on ABC last night? My God,

105
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:57.250
he looked like he got hit by a truck.

106
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.500
These people just keep getting everything wrong.

107
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:05.200
And some reason the pundit class keeps going back to you guys. But in essence,

108
00:06:05.201 --> 00:06:08.800
what I said there was that if this thing was closed,

109
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.600
what would stop the networks and the machinery

110
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.950
from calling it? If it wasn't yeah. Going in the way that it wanted.

111
00:06:17.951 --> 00:06:22.810
Now I'm not officially saying that's exactly what happened here. Okay.

112
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.760
But you can't say it's not sort of in the realm of what is true and

113
00:06:27.761 --> 00:06:31.330
certainly in the ballpark of what is possible.

114
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.250
So I was on live with the daily wire guys and I was on at about

115
00:06:36.251 --> 00:06:38.980
5:30 PM that w so that's Pacific time.

116
00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:41.560
So about 8:30 PM Eastern.

117
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.590
And at that time it was still very up in the air.

118
00:06:44.591 --> 00:06:45.940
There was no sense it was going either way.

119
00:06:45.941 --> 00:06:49.840
It was all sort of shaking out the way it was supposed to by about seven 30

120
00:06:49.841 --> 00:06:54.190
Pacific. So now this is about a 10 30 Eastern time.

121
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.770
Suddenly there was real momentum like Trump,

122
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.230
the Trump thing was starting to work. It was starting to work.

123
00:06:59.231 --> 00:07:03.100
And there was a real feeling like Holy cow, this really is happening.

124
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.690
And then suddenly it looked like Michigan and Wisconsin and Georgia and

125
00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:09.910
Pennsylvania, it looked like they were all going to go Trump.

126
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.290
And then by about eight 30 or so, I did my live, no,

127
00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:17.350
I did my live stream here at about eight 30 Pacific.

128
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.330
So by about nine 30 Pacific,

129
00:07:19.331 --> 00:07:23.530
suddenly the voting just seemed to have stopped in all of these places.

130
00:07:23.531 --> 00:07:26.290
I didn't know that that was a thing. Suddenly people had to go home.

131
00:07:26.291 --> 00:07:27.640
They couldn't count votes anymore.

132
00:07:27.641 --> 00:07:32.260
This is the most important election of a generation of a lifetime ever.

133
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.110
Uh, people got, I take naps also. Um,

134
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:39.490
it all got very bizarre that it seemed to all happen at the exact same time.

135
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.900
And then I think it was at about 11:00 PM. Pacific Joe Biden came out,

136
00:07:43.901 --> 00:07:45.280
gave about a four minute speech.

137
00:07:45.281 --> 00:07:48.100
He stumbled and bumbled made a really weird remark at the end,

138
00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:51.970
got a little confused as to who the governor of Delaware was. Uh, and then,

139
00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.080
and then left the stage.

140
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:58.150
And then Trump came out about a half hour later and in essence said,

141
00:07:58.151 --> 00:08:02.920
we won. Um, and you got to S he made a mistake. So here's what this is.

142
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:06.490
This is one of the things that were Trump and language, get a little screwy.

143
00:08:06.491 --> 00:08:09.520
And then you, you throw in a dishonest media and you have a problem.

144
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.750
Trump in essence said, you don't go ahead and count more votes.

145
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.200
Now what he meant. And I, I, I would bet anything on this.

146
00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:19.570
What he meant was you don't count votes. That shouldn't count.

147
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.230
Not that you shouldn't continue counting all of the legitimate votes,

148
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.510
but that's sort of like a Trump sort of, you know,

149
00:08:25.511 --> 00:08:28.540
he makes these broad statements and then you have to whittle it into something.

150
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.460
But I could see someone watching this right now.

151
00:08:30.461 --> 00:08:32.260
I can see one of you watching this right now and say, Dave,

152
00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:33.940
don't give him the leash on that.

153
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.860
That it seems to me that that's what he was saying.

154
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.740
I don't think that the president of the United States was saying,

155
00:08:38.741 --> 00:08:40.450
don't count legitimate votes,

156
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:43.840
but I saw a million people in the media saying the fascist has arrived.

157
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.380
He doesn't want us to finish the election and everything else. Um,

158
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:52.090
now the problem is that many of these States, uh, Michigan, Pennsylvania,

159
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.210
a couple of the others, they've got democratic governors.

160
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.940
Now that means that they have democratic administrations that most likely the

161
00:08:59.941 --> 00:09:02.430
machinery in those States probably won't buy it and to win.

162
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.500
That's exactly what I was talking about with Glenn Beck on Monday that a

163
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:10.840
conspiracy isn't just, you know, it's not just the,

164
00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:14.310
the evil guys in the Simpsons, laughing in the room. You know,

165
00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:15.420
it's not just that,

166
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:20.430
but that it sort of moves and morphs and kind of happens in real time.

167
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.690
And suddenly as they,

168
00:09:21.691 --> 00:09:25.710
it seems that as they kind of realize that Trump really was gonna win and the

169
00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:26.850
numbers weren't looking good.

170
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.150
Well then suddenly they just started shutting down these States as if that's

171
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:32.880
something that we do on election night. I mean, that, that,

172
00:09:32.881 --> 00:09:37.680
isn't something we do, but I do know we live in a time with, with no rules.

173
00:09:37.681 --> 00:09:39.300
So I suppose anything is possible.

174
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.210
So I want to give you guys a quick update and then we'll talk a little bit about

175
00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:45.630
the media coverage as well. Uh, as of right now,

176
00:09:45.631 --> 00:09:49.350
Trump is up by about 500,000 in Pennsylvania. So that looks pretty,

177
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.180
pretty solid. Apparently they have to vote.

178
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:56.040
They have to do some counting in the Philadelphia area that could go more

179
00:09:56.041 --> 00:09:58.290
blue. You know, big cities tend to go more blue,

180
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:02.640
but the chances that they make up 500, probably not great. That's what 66% in,

181
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:07.140
in Michigan Biden is up 50, which is pretty negligible at 96% in.

182
00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.380
So that clearly could go either way, but by, in technically, as in the lead,

183
00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:13.890
Biden's up 20,000 in Wisconsin, which has absolutely nothing.

184
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.140
And I'm pretty sure that the Trump administration has already said,

185
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.500
they're going to demand a recount there that's with 95% in,

186
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.870
and then the other two big ones at the moment, uh,

187
00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.990
Trump is up by 80,000 votes in Georgia,

188
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.980
not a tremendous amount, uh, but that's with 95% in,

189
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.820
and Trump is up 80,000 votes as well, with 94% in,

190
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.420
in North Carolina. So that's kind of where we stand at the moment. And if,

191
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.680
if the recounts are happening right now and there are notion Nanigans,

192
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:44.940
then hopefully we will have some answers. I mean, nobody wants this thing. Well,

193
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.830
let me not say nobody. Most people don't want this thing to last pass today.

194
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:54.000
Right? Um, I think most people wanted it to wrap up last night. And,

195
00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:55.800
and let me just be very clear on this.

196
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.880
If the numbers had come back and it was clear that Joe Biden had one, well,

197
00:10:59.881 --> 00:11:02.880
you guys know I wanted Trump to win and I still want Trump to win. Right.

198
00:11:02.881 --> 00:11:07.700
I think that is the, I think he is the leader for this time,

199
00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:10.550
this bizarre time we lead in here, uh, we live in,

200
00:11:10.551 --> 00:11:13.910
he is the guy that can lead us most effectively. Uh,

201
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.990
if you care about the things that I care about. So I'm,

202
00:11:15.991 --> 00:11:18.230
I'm putting my cards on the table here, right? I'm not,

203
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.010
I'm not hiding behind anything like everyone on network news does it as if they

204
00:11:22.011 --> 00:11:25.220
have no opinions about any of these things. Meanwhile, you know,

205
00:11:25.221 --> 00:11:28.910
I'm watching ABC news last night and it's anchored by telling you this George

206
00:11:28.911 --> 00:11:32.390
Stephanopoulos, former Clinton staffer. And who's he sitting next to,

207
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.000
but Rahm Emanuel, former Clinton staffer,

208
00:11:35.001 --> 00:11:36.890
and then they've got all Democrats around them. And then Chris,

209
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.120
Christie's there. Now he's a big guy.

210
00:11:38.121 --> 00:11:41.800
So maybe he counts as a couple of Republicans, but it's like, in essence, you,

211
00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:46.340
you guy, he liked that one. Michael liked that one. Um, so, okay,

212
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.610
so I'm putting my cards on the table. So I'm telling you, I,

213
00:11:49.611 --> 00:11:53.860
I do want Trump to win, but if the numbers came back and it was an obvious win,

214
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.750
then I would have absolutely accepted this, accepted that last night.

215
00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.220
And then I would have had to do an autopsy on what I talk about here

216
00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:06.180
and maybe did I see something wrong or whatever, but in essence,

217
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.640
the things that I've been talking about here, this election,

218
00:12:08.641 --> 00:12:13.410
because of the really high numbers for Trump, um, in essence,

219
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:17.160
this is, this is so when, for the future of the Republican party,

220
00:12:17.161 --> 00:12:19.680
I think either way, because they started to get more diverse,

221
00:12:19.681 --> 00:12:24.570
which we'll get into in a minute. And, and the numbers really did go up. So,

222
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.590
so that is good. But here's the question now, it's what I said to Glenn.

223
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.430
How do we trust the machine right now? Like you watching this right now,

224
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.860
do you trust the machine? Do you trust that Philadelphia? Yeah.

225
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.340
Which is in Pennsylvania,

226
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:45.060
obviously that those people there are democratic run Philadelphia in a

227
00:12:45.061 --> 00:12:49.800
democratic run state by a attorney general with an attorney general,

228
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.860
this Shapiro guy, not, not Ben Shapiro, different Shapiro.

229
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.400
That's a good Shapiro. This is the bad Shapiro who literally said days ago.

230
00:12:56.401 --> 00:12:58.560
And we talked about it the other day, uh,

231
00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:03.480
that that Biden will win Pennsylvania. That's what he said before election day.

232
00:13:03.481 --> 00:13:05.940
That's what the attorney general of Pennsylvania said.

233
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:10.080
So do you trust the machinery? Meaning the, the machinery,

234
00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:13.440
the political machinery of Pennsylvania, which happens to be democratic,

235
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.310
do you trust them to, to actually count the votes? Honestly,

236
00:13:17.311 --> 00:13:19.440
if they feel like they can actually flip the election,

237
00:13:19.441 --> 00:13:22.410
which they potentially have the power to do. And then do you,

238
00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.290
at the secondary level, do you trust what I was talking about with Glenn?

239
00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:30.300
You trust the media elites, who all want this guy out?

240
00:13:30.301 --> 00:13:33.870
Do you trust them to do the right thing? As I said before,

241
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.890
it's not conspiracy to say, I don't think these people are fully trustworthy.

242
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.710
I don't think that's it conspiracy theory. Right. So if you're,

243
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.250
if you're out there right now and you're confused and you're not totally sure

244
00:13:44.251 --> 00:13:48.210
who to trust, and you think the system's a little whacked, your, your,

245
00:13:48.211 --> 00:13:51.390
that means you're, you're kind of thinking right now, like everybody else,

246
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:51.930
that's just like,

247
00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:55.050
get me the numbers and I want the numbers and the numbers better be what I want

248
00:13:55.051 --> 00:13:57.870
them to be. And that's how it's going to be. And it's like, come on, man. Like,

249
00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.690
that's not what we're doing here. You see what? I just, I just did a Biden ride.

250
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.170
Come on, man. That was my Biden impression right there. Um,

251
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.680
so I think that that sort of trust level is,

252
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.890
is a huge problem that we've got right now. And I don't know how we get past it.

253
00:14:10.891 --> 00:14:14.680
So my hope here's my hope right now. My hope is that out of the,

254
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:19.110
the States that I just read off to you, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin,

255
00:14:19.111 --> 00:14:20.130
Georgia, and North Carolina,

256
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.260
if we can get results that are tangible results,

257
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.370
uh, from those States, then we can probably declare a winner today.

258
00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:31.620
It doesn't sound like it's going to happen. I mean,

259
00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:34.410
even you could even see on ABC, especially last night,

260
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.710
the entire time they were teasing, Oh, we're going to need a week for this.

261
00:14:37.711 --> 00:14:40.590
We're going to need a week for this. And the thing is, you guys know this,

262
00:14:40.591 --> 00:14:43.800
remember two weeks to flatten the curve. That's what the,

263
00:14:43.801 --> 00:14:48.750
the establishment told us back in March about COVID now we're eight months

264
00:14:48.751 --> 00:14:52.400
later, right? So when they tell you, Oh, we need a week to figure this out.

265
00:14:52.401 --> 00:14:55.130
Well, before you know, it it's six months before you know it,

266
00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:57.260
we're fighting this thing out in Supreme court,

267
00:14:57.261 --> 00:15:01.400
right before the new president or the returning president is supposed to be

268
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:05.210
sworn in on January 20th. So we got a, we got a big set of problems,

269
00:15:05.211 --> 00:15:06.350
but in essence,

270
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:12.230
I think what Trump did last night was he basically drew a line in the sand.

271
00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.050
He said, first off, I'm going to, I'm going to fight. He said,

272
00:15:15.051 --> 00:15:17.690
we're winning in these key States. We've got these numbers here.

273
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.630
We think we're going to win them. And by the way, that's what Biden said too.

274
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:23.480
So they're both in essence saying the same thing. We're losing here,

275
00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:24.830
we're wearing it here, but we think we're going to win.

276
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:28.070
We think we're gonna win. Okay. That's fine. That's just politics. But,

277
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.460
but what, in essence, Trump said, he did say the F-word right? He said,

278
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:34.670
he said the fraud word. So that's number one. Um,

279
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:39.650
but he also basically drew a line in the sand and made it clear that if

280
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:44.390
they feel that there are shenanigans and that's a legitimate

281
00:15:44.391 --> 00:15:48.800
fear that is not calling the election into question, that is a legitimate fear.

282
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.940
Uh, well then in that case that then they'll go to the courts. Now,

283
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.310
do we want this thing going to the courts? If it, I mean,

284
00:15:55.311 --> 00:15:56.300
if this thing goes to the courts,

285
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.850
that means it's worked its way through the system,

286
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.680
the States have made decisions.

287
00:16:00.681 --> 00:16:03.050
We're not totally sure if those decisions were right.

288
00:16:03.051 --> 00:16:06.080
And then we got to get this thing all the way to the Supreme court,

289
00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.050
knowing that Trump put in three of these people,

290
00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:10.730
knowing how contentious that is. I mean,

291
00:16:10.731 --> 00:16:13.670
maybe it feels like it's all just supposed to go that way because,

292
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:16.610
because the energy of the universe or something is just,

293
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:21.110
is just dragging us that way. But, but I hope that is not what happens.

294
00:16:21.111 --> 00:16:25.580
I hope that maybe there are some elected officials in these

295
00:16:25.581 --> 00:16:30.200
States who care about getting it right more than getting their

296
00:16:30.201 --> 00:16:31.790
guy in. And you know,

297
00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:35.780
you can't be bringing in votes that weren't postmarked by election day and you

298
00:16:35.781 --> 00:16:38.510
can't be doing all of this random stuff. You know, there was this,

299
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.430
there was this, uh,

300
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:45.110
image going around Twitter this morning of apparently a hundred thousand

301
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:49.160
extra votes that magically appeared in Michigan for Biden overnight.

302
00:16:49.161 --> 00:16:52.520
So meaning Biden's number went up by a hundred thousand from the time they

303
00:16:52.521 --> 00:16:55.730
stopped counting until the morning, but Trump's, didn't move now.

304
00:16:55.731 --> 00:16:59.960
That's mathematically impossible. It is literally impossible.

305
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.330
And I'm not using the word, literally figuratively. I'm using it,

306
00:17:02.331 --> 00:17:05.960
literally that Joe Biden or Trump. But in this case,

307
00:17:05.961 --> 00:17:09.860
Biden could get a hundred thousand votes with the competitor getting zero votes.

308
00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:14.150
Now they're saying that somebody actually made a mistake and they forgot to put

309
00:17:14.151 --> 00:17:18.920
a one in there. And it's closer to like 15,000 votes for Biden, not,

310
00:17:18.921 --> 00:17:19.880
not a hundred thousand,

311
00:17:19.881 --> 00:17:23.810
but like this sort of stuff is what we're just going to keep hearing more of.

312
00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:28.880
And the unfortunate part is it makes people worry. It makes people go, man,

313
00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:33.590
is the system strong enough to withstand this stuff? Is it,

314
00:17:33.591 --> 00:17:37.070
is it trustworthy enough? I don't know exactly what the answer is.

315
00:17:37.071 --> 00:17:39.710
I don't think anyone knows exactly what the answer is.

316
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:44.420
And I certainly don't think that anyone watching mainstream media is going to

317
00:17:44.421 --> 00:17:46.520
get anything saying, I mean, whatever you do,

318
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:49.440
I hope you give me a couple of minutes of your day, right?

319
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.470
Like that that's wonderful. And this thing's really growing.

320
00:17:52.471 --> 00:17:55.890
And I guess I've carved out a nice little space in that. Um,

321
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.110
but you should not be sitting at home. You know,

322
00:17:58.111 --> 00:18:00.210
we're all sitting at home because of these stupid lockdowns.

323
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.430
You should not have CNN on all day.

324
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:04.530
And I don't even mean that just to make fun of CNN,

325
00:18:04.531 --> 00:18:05.670
it's easy to make fun of CNN.

326
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.690
You shouldn't have any of these channels on all day waiting every minute for the

327
00:18:09.691 --> 00:18:13.470
breaking news of th this, uh, state operatives said that,

328
00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:16.410
that through when he forgot to carry the one and this guy is going there and

329
00:18:16.411 --> 00:18:20.700
they postmark this, like it will make you crazy. So try not to do it.

330
00:18:20.701 --> 00:18:23.430
I don't know if you come here for life advice, but try not to do it.

331
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.300
I don't even have cable anymore, so we don't keep those channels on. Um, but,

332
00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:29.460
but if you want to be engaged in this, it's like, yeah,

333
00:18:29.461 --> 00:18:31.740
you can check in every couple of hours, flip through Twitter,

334
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.670
see what's on your Facebook feed and the rest of it so that you're aware of

335
00:18:35.671 --> 00:18:38.400
what's happening, but, but don't be sucked in at that level.

336
00:18:38.401 --> 00:18:39.840
The idea that we're all trapped at home now,

337
00:18:39.841 --> 00:18:42.990
and then we're watching all of this stuff more and it's designed to make us all

338
00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:46.350
crazy and make us hyper-partisan and everything else. It's, it's,

339
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.560
it's kinda dangerous. Um, all right. So let's, let's step away though,

340
00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:51.390
from like the specifics of what happened,

341
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:53.970
cause it's going to keep unfolding and I promise you, I will,

342
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.990
I will do my best to communicate whatever the truth is to you.

343
00:18:57.991 --> 00:19:01.260
Whether I like it or not. Uh, I want to move on to, uh,

344
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.020
to two stories here that have to do with race,

345
00:19:04.021 --> 00:19:07.500
because it turns out that in a lot of the exit polls,

346
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.450
and I'm not a huge fan of exit polls,

347
00:19:09.451 --> 00:19:12.660
the idea that someone walks out after voting,

348
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:17.070
and there's an exit pollster there and they ask them, you know, what,

349
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.430
who they voted for and what are the issues they care about, whatever. It's like,

350
00:19:20.431 --> 00:19:23.220
if someone approached me as I walked out of the booth the other day,

351
00:19:23.221 --> 00:19:27.120
I would've been like, go after yourself. Like, I don't need to talk to you.

352
00:19:27.121 --> 00:19:29.520
You know what I mean? Like, it's my business, that's it. And I'm a,

353
00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:34.350
I'm a public person and disregard. Um, so I don't like the idea of it.

354
00:19:34.351 --> 00:19:36.660
And we know that people mess with, with pollsters,

355
00:19:36.661 --> 00:19:39.870
Scott Adams has talked a lot about this, how, especially Trump people, you know,

356
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.131
you're,

357
00:19:40.131 --> 00:19:43.290
you're kind of closeted about your Trump's support depending on where you live.

358
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:46.860
You're not going to just walk out of the thing and then just like tell a random

359
00:19:46.861 --> 00:19:49.890
person what you think about everything. Um, but the,

360
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.030
but from the exit polls, it does seem, uh,

361
00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.420
that there was a real minority shift.

362
00:19:57.421 --> 00:20:01.140
And now we're seeing this in actual voting numbers that are coming out now that

363
00:20:01.141 --> 00:20:04.860
there was a real shift in, in the minority vote. Uh,

364
00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:09.540
but that is very unfortunate for the people that trade and race all day long.

365
00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:14.250
And in essence, this is really what the, the left the establishment does.

366
00:20:14.251 --> 00:20:18.090
It's pretty much all they've got. So joy Reed, who is a host on MSNBC,

367
00:20:18.091 --> 00:20:21.300
who is not a good person, I'm sorry, she's just not,

368
00:20:21.301 --> 00:20:25.140
she has written a lot of anti gay stuff from years ago that apparently was

369
00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:26.340
hacked into her computer.

370
00:20:26.341 --> 00:20:28.260
And then everyone just dropped it because she's a lefty.

371
00:20:28.261 --> 00:20:31.890
But if she was on the right, she would've been canceled. Um, she's,

372
00:20:31.891 --> 00:20:35.640
she's sort of the worst kind of partisan thing and trades and just making it

373
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.960
seem like everyone is racist.

374
00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.800
We'll watch this clip from joy Reed on MSNBC last night.

375
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.740
<v 2>But if somehow they managed to stumble into the Supreme court.</v>

376
00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:47.060
Did any of you guys,

377
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:52.180
uncle Clarence and Amy Coney Barrett and those guys to actually follow the

378
00:20:52.181 --> 00:20:56.800
letter of the law? No. I mean, it is a completely politicized Supreme court.

379
00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.800
<v 1>You want to know what modern racism is, guys,</v>

380
00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:06.660
that there are no people out there that don't think black people

381
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:08.790
should be allowed to use the same water fountains.

382
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:13.770
Everyone believes that virtually everyone in the United States wants a quality.

383
00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:17.040
It doesn't care what your skin color is and doesn't care what your gender is.

384
00:21:17.041 --> 00:21:19.830
And in most cases doesn't even care what your sexuality is. Okay.

385
00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.770
That is a fact that doesn't mean that there aren't fringe weirdos,

386
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.930
that don't think those things, but they have no power.

387
00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:29.520
That is a host of a 24 hour cable news network

388
00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:34.320
using a slur. Okay. Using a slur, uncle Clarence,

389
00:21:34.321 --> 00:21:36.240
you see what she's getting at there, right? It started,

390
00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:39.060
it's a name that starts with a T that's three letters that if I say,

391
00:21:39.061 --> 00:21:41.700
if I say the phrase, uncle blank, if I say it,

392
00:21:41.701 --> 00:21:46.320
we know that this video automatically gets the monetized audit automatically.

393
00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:51.120
The way the system works. They'll find me saying it. They will, de-magnetize it.

394
00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.170
I don't even care about the money,

395
00:21:52.171 --> 00:21:54.240
but what that will then do is hurt it in the algorithm.

396
00:21:54.241 --> 00:21:58.680
And then less people will see it. She just used a racial slur. Imagine,

397
00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:03.900
imagine if a conservative did what she just did,

398
00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:05.640
media matters.

399
00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:10.740
And all of these lefty loonies would be calling for whoever's head. It is,

400
00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:13.650
but somehow the anti-racists,

401
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:18.600
the anti-racists of the left are actually allowed to be the most racist towards

402
00:22:18.601 --> 00:22:22.080
black people. So joy Reed, if you are watching this,

403
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:25.440
you are a racist, you're a genuine racist.

404
00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:28.770
You are a modern racist and good luck with that.

405
00:22:28.771 --> 00:22:31.590
And I have no doubt that you'll continue at MSNBC, but of course,

406
00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:36.270
joy Reed is not the only modern racist, uh, Jamil Hill, who you may remember.

407
00:22:36.271 --> 00:22:40.770
She was, uh, at ESPN and then went crazy, woke on him. Well,

408
00:22:40.771 --> 00:22:42.720
she tweeted this.

409
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:48.150
If Trump wins reelection, it's on white people.

410
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.610
No one else, white people, no one else.

411
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:58.860
Well now first off you're male, um, white people are entitled to their opinions.

412
00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:02.580
White people are allowed to vote for whoever their conscience dictates,

413
00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:07.410
just like black people and Asian people and all other people everyone's

414
00:23:07.411 --> 00:23:10.410
allowed to vote for who they think. Now, the funny thing of course,

415
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.230
of what she said here,

416
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:15.300
and she's one of the prime purveyors of just trading and race all day long,

417
00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.950
she's become super successful in the most patriarchal racist society

418
00:23:19.951 --> 00:23:20.670
ever.

419
00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:25.050
I saw her once in the Inn at lax airport and she was walking with Michael

420
00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:28.800
Jordan, not Michael Jordan, Chicago bulls, Michael Jordan, the actor, Michael B,

421
00:23:28.801 --> 00:23:31.950
Jordan who played creed. Right. And they were walking together and he's,

422
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.650
you know, pimped out in his fancy outfit.

423
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.770
And she's in some crazy outfit with these furry shoes.

424
00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:40.290
And like the furry shoes were clearly a lot of dos.

425
00:23:40.291 --> 00:23:44.370
So she's doing okay in this deeply racist state. I don't have furry shoes.

426
00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.510
I don't want furry shoes, but I wouldn't even know where to get burry shoes.

427
00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.150
The point is, uh, she's doing okay here,

428
00:23:50.151 --> 00:23:54.350
but they trade in racism that no longer exists,

429
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:56.690
but don't even take my word for it.

430
00:23:56.691 --> 00:24:00.380
Let's look at some of the numbers because they're actually pretty fascinating.

431
00:24:00.381 --> 00:24:03.770
And you're not going to believe this guys let's pull up the numbers,

432
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:08.630
Donald Trump, you know, Mr. Mr. Hitler, Nazi white supremacist, Donald Trump,

433
00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:14.720
he just got the highest share of the nonwhite vote for the

434
00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:17.600
Republicans since 1960.

435
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.630
So if you just quickly run through these numbers in 1960,

436
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:24.290
they got 32% of non-white voters,

437
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.890
and then it's been pretty messy and depressing since then. Uh,

438
00:24:27.891 --> 00:24:32.330
it bottomed out four years later, it went from 32% to 6%. I mean, that's,

439
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:37.340
that's actually incredible. And then it was sort of 12, 13, 15, 10, 13, 18,

440
00:24:37.341 --> 00:24:40.700
a little higher 11, 12, nine, 17, 10, 11,

441
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:44.630
and then in 2016. Okay. And this is Trump's first time around.

442
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:49.550
It actually went up a bit, right. So we went up 10 points, okay. In 2016,

443
00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.490
and then it went up another, at least it's preliminary at the moment,

444
00:24:52.491 --> 00:24:54.290
but it went up another five points.

445
00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:59.210
So that means in the two elections that Donald Trump has taken place in 2016

446
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.320
and 2020,

447
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:05.210
that means that non-white vote for the Republicans has

448
00:25:05.211 --> 00:25:08.510
actually gone up 15%. That is pretty amazing.

449
00:25:08.511 --> 00:25:11.810
And it makes you think that no, these people,

450
00:25:11.811 --> 00:25:13.640
aren't all uncle whatever.

451
00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:17.450
And that the election of Donald Trump the first time and potentially the second

452
00:25:17.451 --> 00:25:19.340
time, isn't just on white people.

453
00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:21.590
But if you want to just live in your depressed reality,

454
00:25:21.591 --> 00:25:25.040
then I suppose you can go ahead and do it. Um, okay guys,

455
00:25:25.041 --> 00:25:28.400
so I'm going to jump for now. Uh, there's obviously a lot going on.

456
00:25:28.401 --> 00:25:29.930
I got a couple of other podcasts that I'm doing,

457
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.210
and it's obviously going to be a bit of a haywire week.

458
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:34.910
We're going to be going five days a week here for awhile. You know,

459
00:25:34.911 --> 00:25:36.920
originally when I started doing this direct message thing,

460
00:25:36.921 --> 00:25:39.380
we said three days a week, Tuesday through Thursday. Uh,

461
00:25:39.381 --> 00:25:43.190
but there's obviously so much going on and the reaction's been so fantastic and

462
00:25:43.191 --> 00:25:45.770
I'm actually loved doing this. And I think we're,

463
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:49.850
we're doing something important throughout the chaos that, uh,

464
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.060
we're going to do it five days a week. And if things really break today, I'll,

465
00:25:53.061 --> 00:25:55.910
I'll come back and we'll do another live stream and all that as always,

466
00:25:55.911 --> 00:26:00.650
if you want to communicate with me directly, join us@rubinreport.com,

467
00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.341
which by the way,

468
00:26:01.341 --> 00:26:04.880
I put out a link to Rubin report.com today on Twitter and Twitter,

469
00:26:04.881 --> 00:26:09.740
it was warning people that, uh, that it could be a fraudulent website, uh,

470
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.070
and that it may be giving fake news something to that effect. I, I tweeted the,

471
00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:17.510
the screenshot of that. Um, so you know, our big tech overlords,

472
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:21.320
they're always up to something anyway, uh, stay calm. We're,

473
00:26:21.321 --> 00:26:25.370
we're going to get through this thing one way or another. And, and I, I still,

474
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:28.670
I'm, I'm feeling confident. I'm feeling good about everything. And even if,

475
00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:31.060
even if it doesn't go the way I want it to go, if,

476
00:26:31.061 --> 00:26:33.440
if we get through this in an honest, sensible way,

477
00:26:33.441 --> 00:26:37.010
and that's a big gift and everything, everything will be okay. And if not,

478
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.490
let's build a bunker or let's build a rocket and let's get the hell out of here.

479
00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:42.830
So we've got options. Okay. Have a good day, everybody.
