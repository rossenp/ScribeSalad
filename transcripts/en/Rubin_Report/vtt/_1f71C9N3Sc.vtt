1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.260
<v 0>Being black, isn't a get out of jail card as Candace Owens, as Larry elder,</v>

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.460
as Thomas soul. Yeah. These people are, you know, uh, uh, Shelby Steele.

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.220
Those people are not their persona non grata on, on, uh,

4
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.750
on as Condoleezza rice who wasn't allowed to speak.

5
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:19.740
I think it was land concert, pianist, smart woman,

6
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.180
but you're not on that side. So those people are afraid.

7
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.310
They're afraid of true scholarship of nuance and of,

8
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.140
of deep thinking.

9
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.600
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

10
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.390
<v 0>I think it was another guy who was maybe VOC club smell.</v>

11
00:00:38.391 --> 00:00:42.740
I can't remember what he said. Most of these people who are driving this debate,

12
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.530
who are coming up with these terms, like white privilege,

13
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.360
like systematic racism and stuff like that, um, are at the bottom of a well,

14
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.810
and they're looking up at their sliver of the sky and all they can see is that

15
00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:55.250
sliver of the sky, there,

16
00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:58.790
isn't a comprehensive understanding of the world when you live in the real world

17
00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:01.130
and you have to make a restaurant work. When you have to manage a restaurant,

18
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.260
when you get down to the level of detail,

19
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.190
nobody is talking about your gender or your sex.

20
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.020
We've got to get the food to the customers, man.

21
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.080
And we've got to stay in business, which means I don't have time for that.

22
00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:15.320
I have time for bottom line stuff. And I, and I got my kids and I got,

23
00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:18.710
I gotta make my relationship work. And I got up and I got this pain here.

24
00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:22.040
So I'm nervous about that. That's what it is to be a human being. Yeah.

25
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.810
So a lot of this stuff, when you say getting in trouble for what you said,

26
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.750
it's not real, there's a lot of chatter and a lot of white noise,

27
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.120
but you can ignore it. Your job is to, to stay honest and, and,

28
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.820
and be in the business of original self-expression and keep doing it because

29
00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:41.210
it's needed. And it's water. Bill Burr will say that bill burrow would be like,

30
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.540
he says crazy things on stage. And people are like, Oh, I mean,

31
00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:48.980
I've seen people go our deal out of, if you don't say that. And I said to bill,

32
00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:52.250
I go, you're so gutsy. I mean, he goes, no, not eight people on Twitter.

33
00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:54.320
Hate me, everybody else gets it. And he's right.

34
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.750
<v 1>Right. They'll call them racist. And then it's like, yeah,</v>

35
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.760
my wife happens to be black, right? Not that that.

36
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.680
<v 0>That's not a get out of jail card. It's not anymore being black.</v>

37
00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:08.270
Isn't a get out of jail card. Ask Candace Owens, ask Larry elder as Thomas soul.

38
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.390
These people are, you know, uh, uh, Shelby Steele.

39
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.320
Those people are not their persona non grata on, on, uh, on,

40
00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:18.650
on you as Condoleeza rice who wasn't allowed to speak.

41
00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:22.640
I think it was land concert, canister, smart woman,

42
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.080
but you're not on that side. So those people are afraid.

43
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.000
They're afraid of true scholarship of nuance and

44
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.480
of deep thinking. And it requires that.

45
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.190
<v 1>What about the regular people though,</v>

46
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.950
not the comics that are supposed to be doing this and the artists that are

47
00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:41.660
supposed to be expressing themselves. Cause that's,

48
00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.920
that's the big one I get now,

49
00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:46.280
like the amount of mail I get every day from people that are just like,

50
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.570
I have to be anonymous on Twitter. I can't post on Facebook anymore.

51
00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:54.440
All of that stuff because their job is not expression and they're afraid they're

52
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.450
going to lose their job if they can.

53
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.000
<v 0>And that's, what's so disheartening that corporations,</v>

54
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.430
if you work for a large corporation, they don't care.

55
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.400
They're about their bottom line. You really think,

56
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.510
and it's not that they're racist or anything. Do you really think that, uh,

57
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.460
because Adidas or Nike or Netflix, whoever stands against racism,

58
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:18.700
do you stand against racism guys? Da, da. That's awesome.

59
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.030
If you can go back and stop slavery, would you? Wow.

60
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:26.020
You're so noble and thanks for posting that black square because that's what a

61
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:29.020
single mom in the hood needs from you,

62
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.860
but she must be breathing a breath of fresh air as she's trying to raise three

63
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:34.660
kids. That must be fantastic.

64
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:37.870
And our other kids just got picked up on a marijuana bid and is looking at

65
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.000
getting stuck in the system that he can't get out.

66
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.580
But thanks for your black square. And thank you,

67
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:47.320
Hollywood actors for taking responsibility. I appreciate that.

68
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.830
Cause you guys are making such a difference. It's embarrassing.

69
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.440
It's embarrassing. And thank you.

70
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.180
Thank you for repeating the phrase that was given to you by someone you don't

71
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:02.380
know, like systematic racism and white privilege, it sounds good.

72
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:05.680
It makes you feel emotionally cathartic. I suppose.

73
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.740
What are you actually doing? Where were you?

74
00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:12.430
When a hundred black people were shot in Chicago, uh,

75
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:15.910
over father's day weekend, five of them, children who were killed.

76
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.450
Where were you? Why are you not in the street? They're my friends,

77
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.020
but you're not because you're too busy because at the end of the day,

78
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:26.680
you can't be, unfortunately, sometimes things are bigger than you are.

79
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.660
And so all you can do is, is reach out like a spastic and kind of say,

80
00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:34.600
I let me tweet something. I'm against racism.

81
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.900
I'm for peace and harmony. You're for peace and harmony.

82
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.710
I'm for war and chaos. Dude, I can't believe that.

83
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.980
But your bumper sticker and that thing you put up in your store,

84
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.480
it really has changed my mind. So I just see a bunch of 'em.

85
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.910
It's like watching a bunch of people on,

86
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.110
on stationary bicycles trying to get somewhere. And I it's, it's embarrass.

87
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.250
<v 1>There's a guy that's about five houses over.</v>

88
00:04:59.251 --> 00:05:01.260
I will walk out with you after this and show you.

89
00:05:01.261 --> 00:05:05.390
Who's got the Bernie bumper sticker and you know, co-exist and the whole thing.

90
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.100
And he has literally the biggest fence in the neighborhood.

91
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.980
Not only does he have a fence in front of his house,

92
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.070
his door has a fence in front of it. I've never even seen this before.

93
00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:16.620
I'm sure they have more of them in Beverly Hills, but like, uh, you know,

94
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.710
his front door, extra fence right there. And it's like, Oh,

95
00:05:19.711 --> 00:05:21.390
well you got all the bumper stickers. Right?

96
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.470
<v 0>Look, I've never been a fan of Donald Trump. I don't like his personality.</v>

97
00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:28.110
I don't think he's an effective leader. I have a lot of criticisms.

98
00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:31.410
I did not vote for him. Um, I'm not a fan. Never have been.

99
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.650
Did you vote for Hillary? I did vote for Hillary and I don't like Hillary.

100
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.600
I didn't know what to do. I couldn't vote for that guy. I just, he just,

101
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.210
and especially in the beginning when he was like, you know, if, if I have,

102
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.970
I want a ban on Muslims, I want to build a wall.

103
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.500
It just all sounded on American. But my biggest criticism of Trump is that he's,

104
00:05:52.501 --> 00:05:55.980
he's a Trumpist. Yeah. I mean, you know, if I were debating Trump, I'd be like,

105
00:05:55.981 --> 00:05:59.510
you care about Trump. You don't about the country. So I have my, my criticisms,

106
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.230
but what's interesting about the sort of, and I was a critic of it.

107
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.700
I don't like the idea of building a wall.

108
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:07.490
There's gotta be a smarter way to do this. I mean, you know, I, I just, it just,

109
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.310
it just sounded terrible. So, but,

110
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.520
but what's interesting about the most vocal,

111
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.170
the people that are really against the wall and things is the people that are

112
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:21.230
doing that live behind very expensive walls. Try getting in,

113
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.770
try and getting over the wall. That is Harvard, the wall that is Yale,

114
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.740
the wall that is Princeton, the wall that is wetland,

115
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:31.610
the wall that is Williams Collins. Oh, well, forget that.

116
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:32.750
Forget that.

117
00:06:32.751 --> 00:06:36.860
Isn't she responsible for the Tenderloin and isn't that her district in, in, uh,

118
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.800
or was that Maxine waters? The late Maxine? I'm not sure. Oh, vaccine is here.

119
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.530
Yeah. That's Nancy. Yeah. So I mean,

120
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:45.590
of course people live behind very expensive walls.

121
00:06:45.591 --> 00:06:48.950
I can't afford those walls and I don't have the grades. So,

122
00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.320
but why is it people can't connect those two things? Well,

123
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:52.850
here's another thing that I, that I thought of it.

124
00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:55.160
I thought Kansas Owens was w had said in,

125
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.230
because what I've been doing lately is I'm on YouTube.

126
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.710
And I watched debates between black conservatives and black liberals.

127
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.460
And I get a lot from both sides. Yeah. I love I'm not, I'm not, you know,

128
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.650
it's very interesting. I'm I'm the guy who has been,

129
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.980
my dad had me reading Thomas. So a long time ago, you know, this stuff. But,

130
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.090
but what what's, what's interesting is that she said, look,

131
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.230
if black lives really matter and you, you are worried about black,

132
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:23.090
the black sort of, uh, vote and the black, you know, political influence,

133
00:07:23.091 --> 00:07:25.430
which is what it comes down to, especially in local politics,

134
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.210
you better get serious about criminalizing the border.

135
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.400
Because if you have unchecked immigration from South of the border,

136
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.190
the Latino vote, God bless him,

137
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:42.320
is going to render your vote as an African-American obsolete.

138
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.180
You can say whatever you want,

139
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.900
but when it comes down to getting votes,

140
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.100
politicians are going to be able to skip over your districts.

141
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:56.600
It's not going to matter in five years. And I, I kinda, I went, Ooh,

142
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.500
wow, Oh, that's a, that's a contradict. That's a real, that,

143
00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:03.650
that puts the left in, in a real predicament here.

144
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.970
It really does because now you've got to get very serious about, uh,

145
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.960
immigration, maybe even draconian hard, terrible,

146
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.610
terrible problem.

147
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.490
When you have children and you have desperate people trying to come over your

148
00:08:16.491 --> 00:08:18.830
border, I don't know the answer. I don't know how to solve that,

149
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:22.610
but what a dilemma and what a corner they have painted themselves.
