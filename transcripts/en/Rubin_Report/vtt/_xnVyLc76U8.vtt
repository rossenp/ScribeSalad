2
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.031
<v 1>This week,</v>

3
00:00:14.031 --> 00:00:18.560
150 writers and academics signed an open letter published in

4
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.040
Harper's criticizing the current cancel culture.

5
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.130
The letter was equally praised in mocked.

6
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.200
Joining me now to react author don't burn this book, our friend, Dave Rubin.

7
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.360
All right, Dave. Good to have you on, you know, Dave,

8
00:00:32.361 --> 00:00:36.680
this letter to me is fascinating because you have all of these

9
00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:38.870
liberals who were saying, you know,

10
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.950
we refuse any false choice between justice and freedom.

11
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.970
We cannot have an intolerance society and they go on and on.

12
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.530
And this letter about, you know, the people I have to accept the opposing views.

13
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.600
I just find that hysterical because as someone on the right we've

14
00:00:56.601 --> 00:01:01.100
had heart views censored for several years now, what's your take on this?

15
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.400
<v 2>Yeah. Well, you're setting it up the right way because look any defense.</v>

16
00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:09.200
I know you're going to agree with me on this.

17
00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:13.850
Any defense of free speech is good, especially right now. However,

18
00:01:13.851 --> 00:01:17.360
most of the people on there who are lefties, liberals, progressives,

19
00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:18.320
whatever you want to call them,

20
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.910
they've been pretty much silent as the mob has come for anyone.

21
00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:24.530
That's right. Leaning. I mean,

22
00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:28.790
we know right now during this show that there are people at media matters who

23
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:30.200
are waiting for you, judge,

24
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.640
Jeanine or me to say one word wrong so that they can send a mob and try to

25
00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:37.280
cancel advertisers. They do this with Tucker.

26
00:01:37.281 --> 00:01:41.480
They do this with everyone on the right. And it's like, where were you guys?

27
00:01:41.481 --> 00:01:44.720
So what's happening now is that, although it's late, it's like,

28
00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:48.800
they're suddenly seeing their universities crumble because Princeton and Harvard

29
00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:51.530
and Yale, they're all having massive problems. We all see it.

30
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.980
And we know that all the statues are coming down as you were talking about

31
00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:56.870
earlier and they're suddenly going, Oh,

32
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.610
the mob is starting to show up to my university and take down my statues and

33
00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:04.160
they may show up at my house. So I better speak up,

34
00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:06.830
but I have to tell them it's a little too late.

35
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.120
And I'll just say one other thing,

36
00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:12.290
which is a couple of the people on the list have tried to cancel me. So, uh,

37
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.760
this thing was personal for me too.

38
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.770
<v 1>Well, I got to tell you, I read your book, don't burn this book and I,</v>

39
00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:22.640
and I have to say, I love it. It's great reading. It is. And, uh, but,

40
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.950
but what's, what does it make sense to me,

41
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.970
Dave is the fact that, um, sorry about that.

42
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.470
What does it make sense to me is the fact that they wouldn't, uh,

43
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.300
at least attempt to join forces with those of us on the left,

44
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.670
because if they truly on the right, I should say,

45
00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:43.790
because if they truly believe that there is no choice between justice and

46
00:02:43.791 --> 00:02:44.480
freedom,

47
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.800
why not align yourself with people on the right with conservatives we're

48
00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:51.320
stronger United aren't we.

49
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.471
<v 2>Absolutely.</v>

50
00:02:54.471 --> 00:02:58.430
And that's what actually my whole book and my political evolution is about

51
00:02:58.431 --> 00:02:59.200
because I,

52
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.820
on the left and then as I saw the left failing consistently on free speech

53
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.110
failing to stand up for the liberal principles that it purported to believe in,

54
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.510
what I suddenly found was, Whoa, look at this.

55
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.010
There's all these people on the right,

56
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:16.240
these conservatives and libertarians who I may have some political disagreements

57
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:19.180
with. That's fine. You, you read my book, you know, we disagree on some stuff,

58
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.390
but that's okay. But what do we believe in? We believe in the constitution.

59
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:24.910
We believe in free speech. We believe in free expression.

60
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.170
We believe in capitalism.

61
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:30.700
We believe that fundamentally America is a good experiment and that's all it is.

62
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:33.730
It's an ongoing experiment. And yeah, I think they're,

63
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:38.200
they're really afraid of being called conservative that in liberal

64
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:40.840
circles, that is still the scariest thing. Oh,

65
00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:44.400
you're suddenly friends with conservatives. You must be a conservative. And,

66
00:03:44.401 --> 00:03:47.800
and they've got to get over that because the ivory tower is crumbling and it's

67
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:49.330
going to crumble right on top of their heads.

68
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.410
<v 1>Well, the amazing part of it is that the feelings are usually, I mean,</v>

69
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.800
from what I'm about to know, and I'm kind of in the middle of things here,

70
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.110
it's from the left toward the right.

71
00:04:01.111 --> 00:04:02.700
They don't want to hear people on the right.

72
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.620
I've never heard people on the right side.

73
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.120
I don't want to hear from that person.

74
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.810
I don't think that they should be allowed to speak at my child's university.

75
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.280
I mean, and, and we know from the time that Donald Trump was elected,

76
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.660
that you become, you know, people on fringe, you, they don't want you to be, uh,

77
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.720
they don't want to communicate with people I've had at my wedding,

78
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.890
don't talk or that my, my children's weddings actually,

79
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.820
they don't talk to me anymore. And it's not usually the right toward the left.

80
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.960
I mean, the intolerance is on the left. Am I wrong?

81
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.600
<v 2>But the woke, no,</v>

82
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.740
the woke condition is a mind virus. What is a virus?

83
00:04:40.741 --> 00:04:44.520
A virus is very easy to catch and very hard to get rid of.

84
00:04:44.521 --> 00:04:46.920
And that's what this thing is. It all kind of sounds right.

85
00:04:46.921 --> 00:04:50.460
Everyone I disagree with is a racist. Well, that sounds pretty good.

86
00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:53.640
That's pretty lofty. Once you accept those ideas,

87
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.810
you know that if you then walk away from it, you will be called a racist.

88
00:04:57.811 --> 00:05:01.650
So it's almost a self hostage situation. Uh, but you know,

89
00:05:01.651 --> 00:05:04.590
you also hit on something, which is that in the letter, the implication was, Oh,

90
00:05:04.591 --> 00:05:07.260
well, we're not on the right. The right still has these problems.

91
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.630
I don't think there was one Trump supporter on there. It's like,

92
00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:12.180
if you really want to be for a plurality of opinions,

93
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.250
couldn't you have found one Trump supporter or one really staunch conservative

94
00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:20.970
that you would have believed, could have signed on to that thing. So it's a,

95
00:05:20.971 --> 00:05:22.530
it's a disease of the left right now.

96
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.390
<v 1>Thanks for being with us, Dave, thanks so much.</v>
