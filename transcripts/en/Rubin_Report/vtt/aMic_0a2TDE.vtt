00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.180
<v 0>I think a lot of companies are saying, well, Hey, we're already doing that.</v>

2
00:00:03.181 --> 00:00:03.900
We don't,

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.130
we don't make these decisions based on someone's race or their gender or their

4
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.470
age or any other protected characteristic,

5
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.290
but should we be doing something else? Um,

6
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.590
sometimes people want to throw training at it. Um,

7
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.140
and there's unfortunately not a lot of data that says training is very effective

8
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.910
and even the federal government has said that.

9
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.620
<v 2>Hey, I'm Dave Rubin and it's small business week here on the Rubin report.</v>

10
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.940
Joining me today is Wendy motor reli co-owner of HR

11
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.660
Northwest from Seattle Washington, Wendy, welcome to the show.

12
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.840
Thank you very much, Dave. So I know that legally,

13
00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:52.670
I have to ask you about what life is like in Seattle right now with your

14
00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:55.340
autonomous zone before we get into anything else.

15
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.050
<v 0>Of course, of course we are outside of the autonomous zone,</v>

16
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.500
but it seems to be changing by the day. Yes.

17
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.780
<v 2>Are you hearing from people that have businesses that are in the autonomous own</v>

18
00:01:08.781 --> 00:01:13.760
or around the autonomous zone about how they can treat their employees or ask

19
00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:17.300
people to come to work or are people not wanting to come to work or anything

20
00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:18.134
else like that?

21
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.500
<v 0>Yes, we have clients that are outside of,</v>

22
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.360
but near the autonomous zone who are dealing with the

23
00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:30.950
need to protect their employees from, from some, some,

24
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.080
from some of the writing that is happening.

25
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.030
So they are dealing with opening up late, leaving, um,

26
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.860
letting people leave early and otherwise allowing employees to get out so they

27
00:01:42.861 --> 00:01:46.430
can board up windows and, uh, that kind of thing.

28
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.960
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.340
So I thought you'd be interesting to talk to for a couple reasons because your

30
00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:56.780
business sort of deals in many ways with the business of business, how,

31
00:01:56.781 --> 00:02:00.560
how do you handle these strange situations, not just, you know,

32
00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:02.870
autonomous zones and protests and that sort of stuff,

33
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.760
but obviously COVID asking employees to come back to work when everyone hears

34
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:11.720
these mixed messages from the government and from their employers and everything

35
00:02:11.721 --> 00:02:14.420
else. Uh, so I guess first, can you talk a little bit about your,

36
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:18.980
your company's sort of general ethos and then how you apply that to these

37
00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:20.270
strange times that we're in right now?

38
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.790
<v 0>Sure. Yes. Well,</v>

39
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.300
what we do is we are HR professionals.

40
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.190
We help our clients make good business decisions with respect to

41
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.190
employment related matters. So we,

42
00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:38.780
we try to help our clients strike that balance between taking care of

43
00:02:38.781 --> 00:02:43.640
employees and doing right by them and then also doing right by the business so

44
00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:48.560
that this business can continue to be sustainable and exist for a long period of

45
00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:53.090
time. So, um, we help our clients navigate very tricky laws,

46
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.650
especially the more recent laws like the FCRA, the families,

47
00:02:57.651 --> 00:03:02.110
first coronavirus response that just recently passed, um, you know,

48
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:05.380
back in late March. And there are,

49
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.440
there's just a tangle of complexities around that. So.

50
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.740
<v 2>You guys learn on the fly because I know that looking at these PPE</v>

51
00:03:13.741 --> 00:03:15.660
documents and everything we signed up for,

52
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.190
and it from talking to other small businesses,

53
00:03:17.191 --> 00:03:20.670
it's like whether you're an HR professional or a small business owner or a

54
00:03:20.671 --> 00:03:24.840
lawyer, I mean, this is seriously complex stuff that often changes. I mean,

55
00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:27.450
every week it seems like the rules and regulations change.

56
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.080
<v 0>It is it's changing constantly. We,</v>

57
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.910
we subscribe to a number of different alerts with the government, with, um,

58
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.800
with law firms and then we have some HR related resources that we buy into as

59
00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:45.690
well. But then a lot of it is our team just keeping on top of it,

60
00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:49.380
reading up on the regulations themselves. And,

61
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.650
and then we're constantly kind of, um,

62
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.780
discussing it with each other to make sure that we're,

63
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.560
we're all staying on the same page about how these should be interpreted and

64
00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.633
utilized.

65
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.610
<v 2>What are the types of things that businesses are going through right now?</v>

66
00:04:02.611 --> 00:04:06.470
Like some of the consistent questions that you guys are getting as businesses?

67
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.410
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

68
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.970
A huge question that keeps coming up is that my employee is scared to come to

69
00:04:11.971 --> 00:04:16.950
work. They are, they are immune compromised maybe,

70
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.420
or they just don't want to come to work right now because they're afraid of

71
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.430
coronavirus or they have some other reason that they just feel really

72
00:04:26.431 --> 00:04:29.820
uncomfortable coming in. So that's been the biggest challenge.

73
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.830
And I would say most of the time we're seeing employers giving people a leave of

74
00:04:34.831 --> 00:04:36.720
absence, um,

75
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.640
at least for a few months while we all sort of weather the storm,

76
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.400
um, of course it's understandable,

77
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.100
but at some point businesses get to a point where they say, Hey,

78
00:04:47.101 --> 00:04:51.060
this is causing serious staffing issues now. And I have to bring my people back.

79
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.240
<v 2>Are you hearing a ton? This is a slight offshoot of the,</v>

80
00:04:54.241 --> 00:04:55.650
of the Corona thing specifically,

81
00:04:55.651 --> 00:05:00.360
but are you hearing a ton from employers or employees that are now,

82
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.960
uh,

83
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.740
being confronted with all these diversity and inclusion memos and all of these

84
00:05:04.741 --> 00:05:07.350
things, sort of a set of guidelines that it's,

85
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.130
it's always seems sort of unclear where it comes from or how they have to apply

86
00:05:11.131 --> 00:05:15.210
it, uh, where suddenly, you know, just hiring someone on,

87
00:05:15.211 --> 00:05:17.880
on the basis of their qualification is no longer.

88
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.890
<v 0>Yeah, that is a really difficult question. We've had clients come to us and ask,</v>

89
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.000
Hey, what should we be doing around diversity equity inclusion?

90
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.850
And should we be doing more? So we're,

91
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.920
we're definitely having that conversation.

92
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.750
I personally really like to look at the data and the research around it. Uh,

93
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.400
not just assume it's a hiring problem or it's a promotion problem,

94
00:05:41.401 --> 00:05:44.730
but really try to try to dig into the details.

95
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.930
I think that certainly it makes sense for companies to look at whether they have

96
00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:53.490
any specific biases in their hiring processes. If it's,

97
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.610
if that's clear that you are making these decisions based characteristics other

98
00:05:58.611 --> 00:06:00.890
than their qualifications for the job,

99
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.520
then of course a company should absolutely look at that. Um,

100
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.270
but I think a lot of companies are saying, well, Hey, we'll already doing that.

101
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:09.020
We don't,

102
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.250
we don't make these decisions based on someone's race or their gender or their

103
00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:15.560
age or any other protected characteristic,

104
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.410
but should we be doing something else? Um,

105
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:21.650
sometimes people want to throw training at it. Um,

106
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.230
and there's unfortunately not a lot of data that says training is very effective

107
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.900
and even the federal government has said that. Um,

108
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.180
so it is an area where we're still grappling.

109
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.950
We're talking to various diversity experts out there to try to figure out

110
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.360
what does, what is the right way to approach this problem? Have you seen.

111
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.920
<v 2>The general sort of business of, uh,</v>

112
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.900
HR change say over the last decade or so where now it seems like so much of

113
00:06:49.901 --> 00:06:54.310
it is public where maybe back in the day, if people had a problem,

114
00:06:54.311 --> 00:06:58.540
you complain to your superior, they take it to HR. There's some sort of process,

115
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.320
maybe it's good. Maybe it isn't versus these days where it's sort of like,

116
00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:05.620
if something happens to someone at work, what's the first thing you do,

117
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.520
you screenshot the email yet you text it to somebody at Buzzfeed.

118
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.630
Next thing you know,

119
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.530
the boss has been fired before the company has done any sort of, uh,

120
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.290
research or, you know, uh, uh, an investigation.

121
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.400
<v 0>Yes, that has added a huge new component.</v>

122
00:07:21.401 --> 00:07:25.870
So now instead of employees, maybe off of work,

123
00:07:25.871 --> 00:07:30.340
having a few beers at a local bar might have a conversation together about

124
00:07:30.341 --> 00:07:31.330
something work-related.

125
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.370
Now that conversation ends up getting broadcast and it is causing a lot,

126
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.850
I think a lot of harm in a lot of ways because people aren't,

127
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:41.680
aren't filtering what they're saying.

128
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.630
The information is getting back to their boss,

129
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:48.430
that they called their boss a jerk on social media and it's causing a lot of

130
00:07:48.431 --> 00:07:53.350
issues and sometimes employees get fired and that firing is upheld when they're

131
00:07:53.351 --> 00:07:55.810
all they're saying is my boss is a jerk.

132
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.320
And sometimes the language is a lot more colorful than that. Yeah.

133
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.790
<v 2>That must be interesting for you that you deal with all sorts of different</v>

134
00:08:03.791 --> 00:08:05.680
companies that have different cultures,

135
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:10.720
as opposed to being just an in-house HR team that you're dealing with.

136
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.650
You're dealing with one boss or one culture you're dealing with all sorts of

137
00:08:14.651 --> 00:08:15.484
different ones, right?

138
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.580
<v 0>We are yes, all sorts of different businesses,</v>

139
00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:21.400
all sorts of different cultures and environments.

140
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:25.960
And so we really try to tailor what we do to that culture and environment and

141
00:08:25.961 --> 00:08:30.250
get to know our clients well and understand what they're trying to do so that we

142
00:08:30.251 --> 00:08:35.110
can help guide their policies and their reactions to employee questions and

143
00:08:35.111 --> 00:08:37.180
concerns in that way.

144
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:42.550
<v 2>So what should the average person that doesn't know anything about HR</v>

145
00:08:42.551 --> 00:08:44.830
people? What should we know about HR people?

146
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.970
Because I think you guys probably get caught in the mess more than anybody else

147
00:08:48.971 --> 00:08:49.780
these days.

148
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.240
<v 0>We do. I would say right now,</v>

149
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:57.000
HR people are all just trying to keep up with of the legislation and how it

150
00:08:57.001 --> 00:09:01.860
all interacts together. And we work with clients in Washington, Oregon,

151
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:02.671
and California,

152
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:07.350
which have a lot of complex state laws on top of new

153
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.930
brand new federal laws. And it's often very,

154
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.490
very unclear how they all are supposed to work together. Um, I,

155
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.740
I think that in general,

156
00:09:16.741 --> 00:09:20.760
HR people are doing their best to navigate all of that and act as sort of that,

157
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:26.010
that intermediary between senior management and

158
00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:30.450
employees. Um, and of course,

159
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.500
just like in any profession, there's some, some bad apples out there too.

160
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.770
<v 2>Yeah. All right. Well now I'll let you be sales woman or sales person, uh,</v>

161
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.610
pimp out your website and the bids for anyone that wants more info.

162
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:48.620
<v 0>Yeah. Thank you. We, you can find out more information at our website,</v>

163
00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:52.340
which is HR T northwest.com.

164
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:56.930
