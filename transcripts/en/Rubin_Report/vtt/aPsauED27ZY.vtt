00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.560
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage.</v>

2
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.393
[inaudible].

3
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.950
<v 1>Holy. Are you real people?</v>

4
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.330
Are you guys real people look at this,

5
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.800
a room full of real people in

6
00:00:36.801 --> 00:00:39.710
2020. This is absolutely incredible.

7
00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:44.120
You guys are doing the greatest protest in American history,

8
00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:45.080
right this second.

9
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.870
I did not think when I signed on to do SAS this year,

10
00:00:53.871 --> 00:00:58.130
that my first speech of 2020 was also going to be my last speech of

11
00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:01.490
2020, but they shut us down all year. Right?

12
00:01:01.491 --> 00:01:04.070
I have not spoken in front of people all year. This is,

13
00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:05.780
this is my favorite thing to do. I mean,

14
00:01:05.781 --> 00:01:09.080
far more than doing a YouTube show and interviewing people and babbling to the

15
00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:12.620
camera, actually seeing real live human beings.

16
00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:15.680
And I come from a place,

17
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.630
a different place than Florida. Okay. I come from a place.

18
00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:22.850
Some of you may have heard of called California.

19
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.860
Recall Gavin, there you go.

20
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.110
I come from a place that is completely locked down. I have not seen people.

21
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:42.770
I went out, I got here in Florida yesterday. Freedom, love and Florida.

22
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.753
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.870
<v 1>You know what I did. You're not going to believe this.</v>

24
00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:52.430
I went to a place called a restaurant. Okay.

25
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.190
I sat down a woman who I did not know approach the

26
00:01:58.191 --> 00:02:02.660
table. She took my order and 15 minutes later, food arrived.

27
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.070
Can you believe that guys? That.

28
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.253
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

29
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.800
<v 1>That is what can happen in the great state of Florida. That, yeah,</v>

30
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.040
it can't happen. It can't happen in California. So I was thinking guys,

31
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.770
you've been here for a couple of days. You've heard a ton of great speakers,

32
00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:22.400
YouTubers, podcasters, politicians, all that stuff. I was thinking, well,

33
00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:24.440
what can I say? That's different. What can I say?

34
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:28.460
That's different at this point. And I try to never give the same speech twice.

35
00:02:28.461 --> 00:02:32.150
You guys know I was on tour with Jordan Peterson for about a year and a half.

36
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.130
Love Jordan. And he's coming back, guys, he's coming back.

37
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.940
<v 0>Okay.</v>

38
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.280
<v 1>I promise you. He's going to be back and better than ever.</v>

39
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.910
And it's coming and it can't be too soon. But one of the things,

40
00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:49.190
when I toured with Jordan, he never gave the same speech twice.

41
00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:51.140
And I really tried to do that. So I was trying to think, well,

42
00:02:51.141 --> 00:02:52.670
what can I say to these guys?

43
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.500
That's different than every other speaker has said. And here's the truth guys.

44
00:02:57.501 --> 00:03:00.790
Here's the real truth for you that are in high school that are in college.

45
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.170
You right now, you're about to hit the prime of your life, right?

46
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.900
You are about to hit the prime of your life. Okay.

47
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.670
And what that means is that you are growing up in the most unique time,

48
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.040
possibly, possibly since the inception of this country, everything,

49
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.060
everything is up for grabs right now. Right? I mean, imagine this,

50
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:26.530
if you would have said to anyone, anyone, you know, back in February,

51
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.260
Hey, do you realize, uh, nine months from now,

52
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:32.020
you're going to be locked in your house. You're not going to be going to work.

53
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:33.580
You're not going to be going to school.

54
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.010
You're going to be taking classes on zoom.

55
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:39.130
You're not going to go to restaurants. They're going to, you know,

56
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.970
put no fans in the NBA and the football games and everything else.

57
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.450
You would have told them that they were bananas. And that's real.

58
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.770
That's real right now.

59
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:52.030
So when I tell you guys that you are protesting in the most beautiful freaking

60
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:54.070
way possible right now, you really are.

61
00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.373
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

62
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.790
<v 1>And you have an opportunity because I'm telling you guys the generations before</v>

63
00:04:02.791 --> 00:04:04.380
you that have done a ton of good, right?

64
00:04:04.381 --> 00:04:09.210
We've we fought Wars against real Nazis, not imaginary Nazis, right? We've done.

65
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.430
We've expanded freedoms, right?

66
00:04:11.431 --> 00:04:15.030
We've expanded freedoms for women and for black people and for gay people in all

67
00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:17.850
of these things that America has done it. And it's this place,

68
00:04:17.851 --> 00:04:21.630
this idea as my friend, Dennis Prager calls it, America is this,

69
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.980
this idea that everyone can come from every walk of earth,

70
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.280
from whatever religion, whatever region, whatever nationality,

71
00:04:29.281 --> 00:04:33.510
whatever skin color, we can all come to this magical place and make it better.

72
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.190
And yet, right now you guys, 18, 20, 20, two years old,

73
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.700
it's on you to fix this thing because something ain't right.

74
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.210
And we all know something ain't right, right. Something is not right here.

75
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.080
And it's up to you guys and that's pretty freaking powerful.

76
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.630
So I know a lot of you kind of feel like, well, who's going to,

77
00:04:51.631 --> 00:04:53.310
who's going to come and fix this. Right?

78
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.350
And Donald Trump has done a hell of a lot.

79
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.940
Donald Trump has done a hell of a lot,

80
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.080
man. If Dave Rubin of 2018, whatever, her Dave Rubin a 2020 saying that.

81
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.480
But that's the truth. You know, I'll tell you this.

82
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.620
I'll tell you this one year ago, today, one year ago today at SAS,

83
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.730
Donald Trump spoke. And then I met Trump Jr. Backstage. He said, Hey,

84
00:05:17.731 --> 00:05:21.690
you want to join me at Mar-a-Lago tonight for dinner. So, uh,

85
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.110
my husband I'm gay big Dan whoop. I know you guys don't care.

86
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.340
We're gonna write Tiffany Duda. Very exciting.

87
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.460
Well that tells you that tells you all, you need to know. Conservatives.

88
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.340
Conservatives want people to be free, right conservatives.

89
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.150
So one year ago tonight,

90
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.710
my husband and I went to dinner at Mar-a-Lago with Trump Jr.

91
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.020
And Kimberly Guilfoyle, we're sitting there, we're in there.

92
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.480
And for those of you that haven't been tomorrow Lago,

93
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.740
it kind of looks like Trump.

94
00:05:52.741 --> 00:05:57.090
It's very shiny and it looks very kind of hairspray and the whole thing.

95
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.160
And we're sitting like 10 feet away from Trump. And you remember a year ago,

96
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:04.850
that was the middle of, of the impeachment, the sham, the absolute sham,

97
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.420
impeachment that they put this guy through. And if you were watching CNN,

98
00:06:08.421 --> 00:06:10.430
you're watching MSNBC is that's going on.

99
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.260
They're telling him Trump's freaking out. The walls are closing in.

100
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.160
They're coming to get him. We're sitting there. The guy's laughing up a storm.

101
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.670
He's sitting next to Rudy Giuliani who has the biggest head you've ever seen.

102
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.640
Sky's head is like, got its own orbit,

103
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.740
but he's sitting there and he's got no tie on.

104
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.380
And he's relaxed in his hair's a little floppier than usual.

105
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.900
And a junior says to me at the end of the meal, he says, Hey,

106
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:32.270
you guys want to meet my dad? And I was like, bet, right?

107
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:36.930
I guess I'll meet the president. Why not meet the president? Right. We go up to,

108
00:06:36.931 --> 00:06:41.630
to the president and he's sitting down and Jr says to them, Hey dad, uh,

109
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.960
this is Dave Rubin. He's a podcaster. He's got a great show. Uh,

110
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.810
and Trump looks up at me and he goes, he goes, Hey,

111
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.900
I kind of recognize you kind of recognize you. I said, Oh, well, I'm on,

112
00:06:50.901 --> 00:06:53.420
I'm on Tucker a lot. Maybe it's that. And he goes, Oh yeah, that must be it.

113
00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:56.870
And then he looks at my husband. He goes, well, who are you? And he goes, well,

114
00:06:56.871 --> 00:06:59.540
I'm his husband. He goes, husband.

115
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.400
He slaps his hands on the table. He stands up. He goes,

116
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.240
that is great. You know what? That is great. And I want you guys to know.

117
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:11.300
I don't give a. Yeah.

118
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.640
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

119
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.940
<v 1>And the reason I mentioned that to you guys is because I know that many of the</v>

120
00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:25.330
people in this room have some different religious differences,

121
00:07:25.331 --> 00:07:28.330
some philosophical differences, some existential differences.

122
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.760
But what I know is that right now, guys, it's all of us verse the woke sisters.

123
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.310
That's what it is. That's what it is.

124
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.170
They are coming for every single one of you.

125
00:07:41.171 --> 00:07:44.200
And if you think you're protected because you're black or you're gay,

126
00:07:44.201 --> 00:07:48.160
or you're trans, or you got a limp or a lazy eye, or you're a half a lesbian,

127
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.780
it will not protect you. It will half a lesbian. If you're a small lesbian,

128
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.600
um, it will not protect you guys. It really won't because this thing,

129
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.290
this thing that we're fighting, it's spreading like a virus right now.

130
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.310
And it is on you guys to fix it. The cavalry ain't coming,

131
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:08.530
there are a couple of people that are fighting it.

132
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:11.080
And a lot of them were on this stage over the last couple of days and we'll

133
00:08:11.081 --> 00:08:13.690
continue to be here, but it is on you guys.

134
00:08:13.691 --> 00:08:17.800
It is on you guys in your life to stand up for what you believe in that is the

135
00:08:17.801 --> 00:08:21.610
only way we fix this thing. The adults have dropped the ball.

136
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.010
It's just how it is. There's a lot of reasons for that,

137
00:08:24.011 --> 00:08:25.930
that are for a much longer speech.

138
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.630
The adults have dropped the ball and you guys have a chance.

139
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:32.170
And the reason I'm actually enthused the reason I can end this year with a smile

140
00:08:32.171 --> 00:08:37.060
on my face while this whole thing has been such a disaster is because I see you

141
00:08:37.061 --> 00:08:40.120
guys. I see it. And I know something good can happen.

142
00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:44.860
And we know now that that young people are swinging way conservative,

143
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.040
but not conservative the way they want to frame conservatism.

144
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.120
All of these are these close minded, bigots, and the rest of it, conservative,

145
00:08:52.121 --> 00:08:54.670
meaning you want to conserve freedom. And man,

146
00:08:54.671 --> 00:08:56.790
I will there with you every step of the way,

147
00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.820
but I know I could Babylon for a long time.

148
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.850
And I always like ending the year by getting a little bit from you guys.

149
00:09:07.851 --> 00:09:09.200
So there are two microphones out here.

150
00:09:09.201 --> 00:09:11.450
Let's do a little quick Q and a give me something good guys.

151
00:09:11.451 --> 00:09:14.510
Give me something good to end on. Where, where are the mics? Where am I? Sorry,

152
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.900
people are running already. We got a mic. We'll do a real quick, Oh,

153
00:09:17.901 --> 00:09:21.530
we got 800 people. I'm going to give one word answers. We'll do it real fast.

154
00:09:21.531 --> 00:09:26.360
Everybody wears it. What's that? How is it working for the young Turks?

155
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.670
You know, I'm, I'm trying not to curse too much these days,

156
00:09:28.671 --> 00:09:32.750
so I'm going to have to pass on that question. Um, yeah,

157
00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.640
you could figure it. All right, here we go. Here we go.

158
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.670
<v 2>Hi. So my name is Dee D. My question to you is about middle ground. Obviously,</v>

159
00:09:40.671 --> 00:09:41.301
as students,

160
00:09:41.301 --> 00:09:45.260
we want to be able to be the reasonable ones and have conversations with those

161
00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.480
we disagree with or those who disagree with us.

162
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.770
But we also don't want to give up too much middle ground because they don't seem

163
00:09:51.771 --> 00:09:52.820
to do the same for us.

164
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:57.410
So my question to you is what is the key thing to keep in mind when trying to

165
00:09:57.411 --> 00:10:00.980
talk to someone you disagree with in terms of giving up middle ground,

166
00:10:00.981 --> 00:10:03.620
that way you seem reasonable, but not overstepping.

167
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.590
<v 1>I try to do them as quickly as possible so I can get to as many of you as</v>

168
00:10:06.591 --> 00:10:07.250
possible.

169
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:12.050
The best way is all you gotta do is be a little bit better than them and guys

170
00:10:12.051 --> 00:10:15.830
that ain't that tough cause they're pretty terrible. Okay. That really,

171
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.580
that really is the truth. That really is the truth. What are they going to do?

172
00:10:19.581 --> 00:10:22.100
You've all been in these arguments. You're a racist, you're a bigot,

173
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:24.860
you're a homophobe. All of these things be a little bit better,

174
00:10:24.861 --> 00:10:26.750
be a little more gracious than they will be.

175
00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:30.470
And you can actually win these people over because at the end of the day,

176
00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.850
nobody wants to be miserable. But what is at the end of leftism,

177
00:10:34.851 --> 00:10:38.060
they think they're bringing you to some utopia and they're just bringing you to

178
00:10:38.061 --> 00:10:41.270
endless misery. And if you can show them, if you can show them that boy,

179
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.420
you know, if you believe in personal responsibility, you believe in freedom,

180
00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:46.790
you believe in the ability for people to compete for things,

181
00:10:46.791 --> 00:10:49.300
to make a better society. And all of those things, you know,

182
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.310
will happen one day, they're going to wake up and they're going to go, Oh,

183
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.010
they were right. So just be a little bit better. That's all you gotta do.

184
00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.810
<v 3>Hi, Dave. Um, mine's pretty similar to what he said,</v>

185
00:10:59.811 --> 00:11:02.420
but you just had kind of an amazing conversion,

186
00:11:02.421 --> 00:11:07.370
so to speak and how can I be a good example to my

187
00:11:07.371 --> 00:11:09.680
friends? What can I do to help them to also turn?

188
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:10.761
<v 1>Yeah. Well,</v>

189
00:11:10.761 --> 00:11:13.190
it's a little bit of the first answer that you got to be a little bit better,

190
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.700
but I think the other thing that you can do is welcome the conversation.

191
00:11:16.701 --> 00:11:19.250
You know, I think partly what's happening also is the more that, you know,

192
00:11:19.251 --> 00:11:23.900
we watch mainstream media collapsed and CNN is a joke and MSNBC is

193
00:11:23.901 --> 00:11:27.080
joke in the New York times. I wouldn't, if I don't have a parrot, but if I did,

194
00:11:27.081 --> 00:11:29.240
I wouldn't even use it to align his cage.

195
00:11:29.241 --> 00:11:30.830
Like the more that these things collapse,

196
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.070
the more that we're all going to go into our ideological echo chambers, right?

197
00:11:34.071 --> 00:11:36.020
The more that you guys are going to go, all right, well, I'll watch,

198
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.830
I'll watch Shapiro and I'll watch Rubin and whatever it is on this side,

199
00:11:39.831 --> 00:11:41.900
and I'm not even gonna pay attention, their side, pay it,

200
00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:43.610
pay a little attention to what they're doing.

201
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.060
Pay a little attention to what they're doing and know that some of this is just

202
00:11:47.061 --> 00:11:49.640
a little bit of a, of a psychological makeup.

203
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.190
Sometimes there may be a little more sensitive than you might be.

204
00:11:52.191 --> 00:11:55.780
Sometimes there, maybe they're occasionally seeing something that you aren't,

205
00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:00.070
but, but you can figure out a way and remind them that you're a real person.

206
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.440
Cause I know what happens. You tell them, well, I'm a conservative,

207
00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:04.780
I'm a libertarian. I'm just anything but woke.

208
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.210
And they'll say the worst things about you. And it's like, well,

209
00:12:07.211 --> 00:12:09.490
what do you mean? We've been friends since I was five years old.

210
00:12:09.491 --> 00:12:11.500
You're telling me I'm the worst of all things.

211
00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:14.860
And there are ways to just be a human. Just be a little bit better.

212
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:16.000
That really is the answer.

213
00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:22.230
<v 4>Hi, my name is Roman. I'm from San Francisco, California. Um,</v>

214
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:23.610
prayers are accepted.

215
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.110
<v 1>One refugee, everybody, a refugee from San Francisco.</v>

216
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.190
<v 4>So one thing that I'm noticing is that people are leaving my state in mass</v>

217
00:12:35.191 --> 00:12:38.070
numbers, specifically liberals, and they are going to red States,

218
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.150
but they are not understanding that the left-leaning policies that they voted

219
00:12:42.151 --> 00:12:44.970
for were responsible for ruining their home state.

220
00:12:44.971 --> 00:12:46.770
And they're bringing those to other States.

221
00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.740
I've tried talking to many people about this issue,

222
00:12:49.741 --> 00:12:53.940
but they are reluctant to facing what's been going on and how they actually

223
00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.510
contribute to it back home in California and how they're bringing it elsewhere.

224
00:12:57.511 --> 00:12:59.730
What can I and other Californians do?

225
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:04.230
<v 1>Yeah. Great question. And as a guy that lives in LA, I hear you, man. I hear ya.</v>

226
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.470
Listen, first off, if you live in a red state, you should build a wall.

227
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.820
I want to be very clear about that.

228
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.180
Well, now,

229
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.180
now I know which portion of this speech media matters is going to clip at the

230
00:13:18.181 --> 00:13:23.070
end. Dave Rubin calls for a wall around Florida. Okay. Um, no,

231
00:13:23.071 --> 00:13:24.870
what you do have to be aware of though,

232
00:13:24.871 --> 00:13:28.020
is that it's great that all of these lefties are waking up and they're going,

233
00:13:28.021 --> 00:13:30.000
Holy cow, I want to live in a free state, right?

234
00:13:30.001 --> 00:13:33.210
I want to be able to live in a place with low taxes and low regulations so I can

235
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.430
build businesses. And they're all moving to Texas.

236
00:13:35.431 --> 00:13:37.950
They're all moving to Florida and all these things. That's fantastic.

237
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.580
But what you don't want is them bringing all of the bad ideas.

238
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.750
And one of the things that's so tricky about leftism is a lot of times I see

239
00:13:45.751 --> 00:13:50.310
this all the time in LA people can't make the connection between voting for

240
00:13:50.311 --> 00:13:52.230
these big government, high tax people.

241
00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:54.600
And the fact that everything around them is crumbling.

242
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.750
So the best thing you can do is try to educate them, get them,

243
00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.440
get them to watch some of these videos, watch them. Larry elder videos,

244
00:14:01.441 --> 00:14:04.320
watch them Thomas soul videos. That's really what you got to do.

245
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.120
Get them to Thomas soul,

246
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.260
have them learn a little something about economics,

247
00:14:10.261 --> 00:14:14.970
supply and demand and understand that the government is not some magical

248
00:14:14.971 --> 00:14:16.230
thing that made us free.

249
00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:19.260
We're born free and the government's most to stay out of our freaking way.

250
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:24.030
That's it? That's it. And fight for that. And then you got a chance.

251
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.163
All right.

252
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.570
<v 4>Hey, I'm Spencer from Boise, Idaho.</v>

253
00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:34.290
And the question I have is how do you get liberals and current servers to work

254
00:14:34.291 --> 00:14:38.850
together and hope liberals understand that we need to work together and combat

255
00:14:38.851 --> 00:14:39.660
the left.

256
00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:40.800
<v 1>Yeah. You know, what's so interesting.</v>

257
00:14:40.801 --> 00:14:42.540
So I've taken what four or five questions already.

258
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.660
And several of them have about the same things you guys want to work with.

259
00:14:45.661 --> 00:14:48.750
The other side, you guys actually want to work with the other side.

260
00:14:48.751 --> 00:14:51.380
That kind of means you guys are good, right?

261
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.500
You think at, at lefty conferences,

262
00:14:57.501 --> 00:15:01.130
do they have conferences would be terrible, but if they did,

263
00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:05.180
you're a racist. No you're racist, you're racist. Um,

264
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.820
but do you think they are going, how do we reach out?

265
00:15:07.821 --> 00:15:11.030
How do we reach out to the conservatives? How do we, how do we know?

266
00:15:11.031 --> 00:15:14.090
Of course they're not doing it because what they've done is they've made

267
00:15:14.091 --> 00:15:18.670
politics or religion and religion is religion. Politics is not religion. So,

268
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:19.601
so again, it's,

269
00:15:19.601 --> 00:15:24.500
it's the same answer as before you got to keep showing them that just because

270
00:15:24.501 --> 00:15:28.850
you don't want the government to do everything for you and for them doesn't mean

271
00:15:28.851 --> 00:15:31.640
you're a bad person. That actually it means you are a good person.

272
00:15:31.641 --> 00:15:33.140
It means you're an evolved person.

273
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.830
It means you're somebody who believes in yourself and you want to give yourself

274
00:15:36.831 --> 00:15:41.750
a chance to succeed because the government's not coming to save you and

275
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.430
the speakers at a conference like this,

276
00:15:43.431 --> 00:15:46.400
who are all doing good work in their own way. We can't save you.

277
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:48.200
You have to save yourself.

278
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:50.720
You guys will build the better businesses of the future.

279
00:15:50.721 --> 00:15:54.680
You'll build the new Twitters and the new YouTube and the new Googles and all

280
00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:57.110
those things. But you guys got to do it. It's as simple as that.

281
00:15:57.111 --> 00:16:00.500
And if you do that, if you do that, then that be a pretty good day.

282
00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:06.903
<v 5>Hey.</v>

283
00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.150
<v 6>I'm Jorge. I run center millennials. And as you know,</v>

284
00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.860
a centrist to somebody who wants to play left and play right now,

285
00:16:14.861 --> 00:16:17.650
I run with a little bit of the Chris rock mentality of, Hey,

286
00:16:17.651 --> 00:16:19.300
I'm a little bit liberal on this side.

287
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.070
I'm a little bit conservative on this side.

288
00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:25.180
But with the growing division of a lot of the conservatives I've see today,

289
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:30.250
like how can I integrate my centrism to get people to be more like,

290
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:34.600
not divided so much like fourth, the left, the right. And even within the right.

291
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:38.200
<v 1>Yeah. It's a good question. You know, I'm, I'm the new guy on the right. So,</v>

292
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:41.290
you know, when I see these divisions that I hear some of you guys talking about,

293
00:16:41.291 --> 00:16:41.590
okay,

294
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:44.620
so we've got the more traditional conservatives let's say we've got the more

295
00:16:44.621 --> 00:16:48.280
libertarian side of it and whatever else you want to whittle it down to, to me,

296
00:16:48.281 --> 00:16:51.610
that's great because I know you guys are all in this room right now that that is

297
00:16:51.611 --> 00:16:54.160
fantastic, right? There were believers in this room,

298
00:16:54.161 --> 00:16:56.710
there are nonbelievers in this room. You've got,

299
00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.380
you've got people that come from a purely libertarian side of things.

300
00:16:59.381 --> 00:17:02.110
There are people that want a little more government involvement.

301
00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:03.160
All of those things,

302
00:17:03.161 --> 00:17:05.980
those are little side issues just designed to make you hate each other.

303
00:17:05.981 --> 00:17:07.870
You want to live free. You want to live free.

304
00:17:07.871 --> 00:17:10.060
You want to live by the constitution. Hey,

305
00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.790
we're in the best country to do it right. As simple as that,

306
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:18.040
don't worry about the little problems we got a, we got a much bigger problem.

307
00:17:18.041 --> 00:17:22.030
And that is a woke freaking monster that is trying to eat us.

308
00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:25.810
So either team up with some people that maybe want a slightly higher marginal

309
00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:28.720
tax rate than you do, or you're going to be eaten by the monster.

310
00:17:28.721 --> 00:17:31.210
And it's very obvious to me, which one of those is the right choice.

311
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.460
<v 5>Um, hi, my name is Tofor. Um, I have two questions first off. Can I replace,</v>

312
00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:40.503
will wit.

313
00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:46.600
<v 1>Will I replace, will it, will I replay? I don't know that he's got good hair.</v>

314
00:17:46.601 --> 00:17:50.340
That guy I'll give him that much. Um, second off.

315
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:55.260
<v 5>Um, I hear you more described as a, um, liberal,</v>

316
00:17:55.261 --> 00:17:59.100
not a leftist. Um, could you describe the difference between those?

317
00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:04.310
<v 1>I can do it. I wrote a book about it. So look a leftist. If well,</v>

318
00:18:04.311 --> 00:18:06.290
let's do a liberal first. If you're a liberal,

319
00:18:06.291 --> 00:18:10.640
I actually think that most of you here are liberal in the true sense of the word

320
00:18:10.641 --> 00:18:12.110
liberal, meaning your classical liberals,

321
00:18:12.111 --> 00:18:15.950
which is that you believe in individual rights, individual rights,

322
00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:19.760
and that's what you want, right? You want individual rights.

323
00:18:19.761 --> 00:18:22.310
I know that you guys don't care. What color somebody's skin is.

324
00:18:22.311 --> 00:18:24.320
I know you don't care what gender they are.

325
00:18:24.321 --> 00:18:27.440
I know you don't even care about what gender they identify as you want people

326
00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:32.000
that are abiding by the laws of some of the nation to be treated equally.

327
00:18:32.001 --> 00:18:34.430
That's the core tenant of classical liberalism.

328
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.350
And then you want laissez Faire economics.

329
00:18:36.351 --> 00:18:40.130
You want the market to work and you want logic and reason. These are,

330
00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.860
these are liberal principles that have been hijacked by the left.

331
00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.200
So what's the difference between the left and liberals will.

332
00:18:45.201 --> 00:18:49.490
Leftism is about government power. Leftism is about saying, okay,

333
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:51.110
we somehow us,

334
00:18:51.111 --> 00:18:55.310
the imperfect humans can create this perfect system.

335
00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:58.730
And if only everyone could behave in our perfect system,

336
00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:02.780
we would be in Shangrila, we'd be in utopia. And you know,

337
00:19:02.781 --> 00:19:07.100
who thought like that Santos were guys remember Thanos?

338
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.490
What did that [inaudible] what did that [inaudible] want to do in the Marvel

339
00:19:10.491 --> 00:19:11.060
world? Right?

340
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:15.980
And the Avengers movie Thanos saw a universe with finite resources.

341
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:19.340
And what did he say? He said, I'll do the thing that nobody will do.

342
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:23.120
I will wipe out half of the life in the universe,

343
00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:27.590
in the name of creating peace. And that actually is how the left behaves,

344
00:19:27.591 --> 00:19:30.050
which is why communism and socialism,

345
00:19:30.051 --> 00:19:33.200
these things that come with a smile on your face, right?

346
00:19:33.201 --> 00:19:36.050
It's free healthcare and free education and all of these free things,

347
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:39.860
because we love you. We're not trying to indoctrinate you. We just love you.

348
00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.920
Well, you know, you gotta do, you gotta kill a lot of people on the way.

349
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.600
And that's why communism and socialism have a history of murder and all of the

350
00:19:47.601 --> 00:19:49.070
worst ideas. So that,

351
00:19:49.071 --> 00:19:51.620
that in a nutshell is the difference between left and liberal.

352
00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:55.370
And I think we got one more. We got one more. Yeah. There's the last question.

353
00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.400
And then I'm going into hiding for the rest of the year, by the way, guys,

354
00:19:58.401 --> 00:20:01.670
I'm not going back to California. I'm literally hiding somewhere in Florida.

355
00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.400
And if you can find me, I'll give you a cookie. All right.

356
00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:09.920
<v 7>I'm Ben, I'm from California. Um, I know, but, uh, I just wanted to ask you,</v>

357
00:20:09.921 --> 00:20:10.460
you know, I've,

358
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.510
I've seen a lot of people grassroots in California that have been stepping up

359
00:20:14.511 --> 00:20:16.910
and supporting the president. And I just wanted to ask you, like,

360
00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:21.230
as somebody who's gone from the, the more, um, the left to now, you,

361
00:20:21.231 --> 00:20:24.380
you support the right and you still have your liberal, um, like your,

362
00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.050
your classical liberalism. Right. Which is awesome. Uh,

363
00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:31.760
but how do we like encourage more people to come out and support and,

364
00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:36.230
um, and kind of foster this, um, this movement that we've seen in California,

365
00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:36.660
because I don't know,

366
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.410
you've seen the rallies and just the car parades and stuff,

367
00:20:39.411 --> 00:20:41.540
and California has to be red, right?

368
00:20:41.541 --> 00:20:43.070
Like it looks like California is registered.

369
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:45.380
<v 1>It's crazy. I don't know if any of you saw the videos.</v>

370
00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.680
I went to a Trump rally by accident.

371
00:20:47.681 --> 00:20:50.740
I was driving home and I stopped at the Beverly Hills. Trump rally.

372
00:20:50.741 --> 00:20:51.970
I didn't even know what was happening.

373
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:56.620
And I walked out there and it was the most joyous love Fest

374
00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.370
of diverse, truly diverse

375
00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:06.570
black people, Hispanic people, white people, gay people, Asian,

376
00:21:06.571 --> 00:21:11.040
and nobody cares. Nobody cares. Right? Nobody cares.

377
00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:14.010
And that's what they're trying to trick. You, you see what they're doing.

378
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:18.240
They are trying to use the strength of America in that we all come here,

379
00:21:18.241 --> 00:21:20.400
you look around this room, everyone in this room,

380
00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:24.540
you come from people who had it much worse than you. Every single one of you,

381
00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.780
right? Every single one of you think about your grandparents for a second.

382
00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:31.230
I guarantee you there's nobody in this room who has it worse than their

383
00:21:31.231 --> 00:21:33.450
grandparents. Everybody basically has it better.

384
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:36.570
Everyone has a better that's cause of America guys. That is the truth.

385
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:44.610
And that now is what you are trying to conserve as conservatives.

386
00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.990
That's what you should be trying to conserve that this experiment is not bad.

387
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:50.790
That the left is trying to trick you.

388
00:21:50.791 --> 00:21:55.500
That the founding of America was not 1776 and the incredible

389
00:21:55.501 --> 00:21:56.131
documents,

390
00:21:56.131 --> 00:21:59.280
the declaration of independence and the constitution that have freed all of us.

391
00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.150
They're trying to trick you into thinking that the founding of America was the

392
00:22:03.151 --> 00:22:04.620
16, 19 project.

393
00:22:04.621 --> 00:22:09.390
And that slavery was the fundamental issue that ran everything that

394
00:22:09.391 --> 00:22:13.050
caused all of this and that all of our founders were these evil, racist,

395
00:22:13.051 --> 00:22:16.140
and you know what? They were guys. They were people of their time.

396
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.310
They were people of their time. Just like you guys are people of your time.

397
00:22:20.311 --> 00:22:21.144
Yeah.

398
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:26.550
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

399
00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.580
<v 1>And here's the beauty to wrap it all up, guys. Here's the beauty.</v>

400
00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:33.360
While you guys can serve the good things while you guys can serve Liberty and

401
00:22:33.361 --> 00:22:37.770
you can serve freedom and you can serve all of the ideas that allow you to live

402
00:22:37.771 --> 00:22:41.400
the life that you want. I don't care what you do in your life. I don't,

403
00:22:41.401 --> 00:22:45.300
you can't have my stuff, that's it? Okay. You can do what you want.

404
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:48.480
And that that's, that's the American spirit. That's the American dream.

405
00:22:48.481 --> 00:22:49.950
You got a chance. You got a chance.

406
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.430
But what they will do is destroy themselves in the process.

407
00:22:53.431 --> 00:22:55.650
Because the progressives of today,

408
00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:59.250
the people who are silencing you and calling you all of these things,

409
00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:04.230
the Progressive's of today will be hated by the Progressive's of tomorrow. Okay.

410
00:23:04.231 --> 00:23:07.590
And you know why? Because they're always looking for progress, but progress.

411
00:23:07.591 --> 00:23:08.910
Isn't a destination, right?

412
00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:12.180
That's just like going and there's a cliff coming and you know, it's coming,

413
00:23:12.181 --> 00:23:14.820
but you're going to go over either way. So let's not forget.

414
00:23:14.821 --> 00:23:18.870
Barack Obama ran for president the first time in 2008,

415
00:23:18.871 --> 00:23:20.730
he was against gay marriage. Well,

416
00:23:20.731 --> 00:23:24.450
what do you think the progressives of 2040 are going to think of this guy?

417
00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.260
They're going to go, well, wait a minute, that guy was against gay marriage.

418
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:32.130
He was a homophobe and they will want to burn down his library.

419
00:23:32.131 --> 00:23:35.550
And by their own rules, there'll be allowed to do it. So you know what?

420
00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.290
To package this all together.

421
00:23:37.291 --> 00:23:42.240
Guys just know what you believe and don't be afraid to say it.

422
00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:47.210
And if you do that, if you do that, you will the world in extraordinary ways,

423
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:51.380
you have a chance in a way that that people literally 20 years ago could have

424
00:23:51.381 --> 00:23:55.160
never imagined you got a phone and you might have a thought that you can get out

425
00:23:55.161 --> 00:23:59.600
on Twitter or a five second video that you put up on Tik TOK or whatever it is.

426
00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:02.630
And you can change the world in an instant. You can do that.

427
00:24:02.631 --> 00:24:04.070
And the people before you couldn't.

428
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:08.060
So do that fight for this freaking country while we still got it.

429
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:11.180
Cause it's feeling it's feeling tenuous, guys fight for it.

430
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.990
And I will stand with you guys as a conservative all along the way.

431
00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:20.300
Thank you very much. God bless America. All right, everybody,
