00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:07.880
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.550
<v 1>All right, what's up everybody. It is</v>

3
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.280
November 24th in the year 2020. I'm Dave Rubin. This is the Rubin report.

4
00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:17.510
Direct message.

5
00:00:17.511 --> 00:00:22.460
There's a lot going on as there seems to be these days before I do anything

6
00:00:22.461 --> 00:00:25.610
else though, I have to, uh, I have to have a bit of a mayor.

7
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.100
Kulpa I have to issue an apology because something happened yesterday.

8
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.690
And I feel that if I don't acknowledge it now,

9
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.350
it will just spin and get worse and worse and worse.

10
00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:42.800
And one day could potentially destroy me a scandal and the whole thing.

11
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.830
So here it is. Um,

12
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.810
last night at about 10 15, um,

13
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.490
I took my dog Clyde out for a walk. Um,

14
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.740
I know we're not supposed to,

15
00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:02.480
I know we're supposed to remain in our homes trapped like Gratz from 10:00 PM

16
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.250
to 5:00 AM as per the orders from commander Newsome. Um,

17
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.780
but Clyde was looking at me. We were,

18
00:01:08.781 --> 00:01:12.710
we were sitting on the couch and Clyde was glancing at me and I was watching

19
00:01:12.711 --> 00:01:16.250
Seinfeld. That was the soup Nazi episode, actually. Um,

20
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.290
there's so much talk about Nazis now and he's looking at me and it was just

21
00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:23.900
obvious that just letting him out to pee wasn't enough.

22
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.290
He really needed some exercise and he's he's about a year and a half and he's a

23
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:29.720
boxer and part pit, and there's a lot of energy there.

24
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.570
And I thought I'm not going to just let him in the backyard.

25
00:01:32.571 --> 00:01:36.350
I'm going to take them out for a walk. So at about 10,

26
00:01:36.351 --> 00:01:39.980
15 last night, I, Dave Rubin of Los Angeles,

27
00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:44.720
California took my dog out for a walk. So look,

28
00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:47.030
let the chips fall where they may, it's like,

29
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.480
are the stormtroopers going to be banging at the door while we're doing this

30
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:55.310
live stream? Maybe will I have done it to myself, I suppose. Um,

31
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.640
so if that's what happens and they throw me in the Gulag,

32
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.270
I just want to say it's been a pleasure getting to know you guys. I hope God.

33
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:06.410
I've provided a little sanity in the storm and, um,

34
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.450
somebody come to my house and take Clyde and just walk them earlier in the day.

35
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.540
Okay. Uh, alright, now that we've got that out of the way, and again,

36
00:02:14.541 --> 00:02:15.860
if the stormtroopers come we'll often,

37
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:20.360
we'll just pause the live stream and I'll just, I'll just walk out. Uh, okay.

38
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.860
A bunch of stuff I want to talk about today.

39
00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:24.050
Lockdowns are expanding all over the place.

40
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:26.660
I'm actually only gonna focus on LA for just a little bit,

41
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.080
cause there's some really crazy stuff happening in New Mexico where they're

42
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:33.860
actually shutting down grocery stores and Walmarts and all sorts of stuff.

43
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.341
It's like, okay,

44
00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:37.700
we're going to lock people in their houses and also make sure they don't have

45
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.340
access to essential goods. That really makes a lot of sense.

46
00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:43.250
So that's the first story we're covering today. Number two,

47
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.900
you all know about the big Gavin Newsome dinner up at French laundry.

48
00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:50.660
One of the most expensive restaurants in the entire United States.

49
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.250
Well originally when the story leaked, they said it was 12 people.

50
00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:58.160
It was outdoors, there were social distancing masks,

51
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.020
blah-blah-blah it all turns out to be nonsense. Uh,

52
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.490
there is a reporter and we'll get into, it says 22 people were there, no masks,

53
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.420
no social distancing. And get this guys that this, you know,

54
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:13.360
much of the alcohol bill was the bar bill, the booze bill,

55
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.700
$15,000.

56
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.670
That is about $750 a person in alcohol wine booze.

57
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.350
I'm a wine guy. I like good wine.

58
00:03:25.351 --> 00:03:27.750
And I don't begrudge people that work hard for living,

59
00:03:27.751 --> 00:03:29.730
spending their money as such, uh,

60
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.930
but Newsome who are going to have to discuss a little bit about you in just a

61
00:03:33.931 --> 00:03:35.910
moment. Uh, and then finally, you know,

62
00:03:35.911 --> 00:03:40.380
as we're seeing sort of the mainstream media kind of

63
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.880
recalibrate right now,

64
00:03:41.881 --> 00:03:45.690
like they really feel like the Biden thing is here and they're very excited to

65
00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:50.520
get on their knees and, and pholate him endlessly and the empire. Um,

66
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.690
I found this thread by a journalist, the guy by the name of Jake Sherman,

67
00:03:54.691 --> 00:03:57.630
who's a NBC journalist and a political journalist.

68
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.950
And I'm just going to read the whole thing to you because you need to see a

69
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.630
person example of how these people are not journalists, but they're activists.

70
00:04:06.631 --> 00:04:09.240
And I didn't even need to use air quotes around activists,

71
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.610
but before we get to any of that, guys,

72
00:04:11.611 --> 00:04:15.390
I want to talk to you about second thoughts and I've got it right here in my

73
00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:18.870
hand. Second thoughts is this year's new favorite party game.

74
00:04:18.871 --> 00:04:22.410
That's sure to be the hit of your next game night. At some point,

75
00:04:22.411 --> 00:04:25.200
the election results will be official. I don't know when,

76
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.860
but it will be more necessary than ever to connect with family and friends over

77
00:04:28.861 --> 00:04:31.800
some lighthearted, fun. David, we always host Thanksgiving.

78
00:04:31.801 --> 00:04:33.930
We're doing it again this year. As you guys know,

79
00:04:33.931 --> 00:04:38.100
and we're looking forward to playing some second thoughts after a delicious

80
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.040
Turkey dinner, we got a record breaking huge Turkey,

81
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.460
the play of the game calls for each team to quickly create a list of words for

82
00:04:44.461 --> 00:04:49.440
their opponents to decipher leading to hilarious puzzlement and laughter simply

83
00:04:49.441 --> 00:04:50.071
put guys,

84
00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:54.090
it's a classic word guessing game with a unique West that allows players to

85
00:04:54.091 --> 00:04:58.650
personalize the content and with their voluminous sense of word smithery or just

86
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.890
their witty and warped imaginations. Each round of second thoughts,

87
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.130
all areas high-speed attempt to stump the other team,

88
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.670
both teams create a list of five things using the letters revealed from the

89
00:05:08.671 --> 00:05:10.530
color dice, be witty and wise,

90
00:05:10.531 --> 00:05:13.110
but don't take too long because time is not on your side.

91
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.260
The amount of time it takes your team to create the list is exactly how much

92
00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:18.270
time your opponents get to guess them.

93
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.100
This game gets really fun after a glass or two or three of whiskey or wine.

94
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.370
Good for Gavin Newsome. Second thoughts, the quick thinking verse,

95
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.980
fast talking party game. And for the month of November guys,

96
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.750
the game will be on sale at a special price.

97
00:05:30.751 --> 00:05:34.110
So we'll be sure to get yours today at second thoughts, the game.com.

98
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.770
That's second thoughts, the game.com or at your local target store.

99
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.130
And now back to me, okay. Let's, let's talk about Lockton.

100
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.930
I'm going to get us out of California. You know,

101
00:05:42.931 --> 00:05:47.550
I focus a lot on California here because we are the most psychotic

102
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.870
state. I think there's a study that proved that, uh, new York's closed, but, uh,

103
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.610
California is up there and it's oddly,

104
00:05:53.611 --> 00:05:56.760
I've only lived in New York and California. And yet here I am.

105
00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.050
So I don't know what that says about me. I should probably see a therapist, uh,

106
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.190
but let's talk about New Mexico, uh, because new New Mexico,

107
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:08.990
governor Michelle Lujan Grisham is now shutting down groceries for

108
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:12.860
two weeks after a spike in COVID-19 cases.

109
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:16.130
So let's get the quote from the Washington examiner quote,

110
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:20.630
a dozen grocery stores around the state have been forced to close for two weeks

111
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:25.370
because of a public health order issued by governor Michelle illusion

112
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.240
Grisham at a time when the state's residents are suffering from record high

113
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.260
unemployment and food insecurity, critics say,

114
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.200
now they've also closed a couple of Walmarts.

115
00:06:36.201 --> 00:06:38.420
They've got people standing in lines all over the place.

116
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.200
You can feel this kind of all over the country right now suddenly like toilet

117
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:46.880
paper and paper towels are suddenly in short

118
00:06:46.881 --> 00:06:50.210
order. And the, and the, you know, the stock is low and all that kind of stuff.

119
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.220
Um, so look, I'll do this at the broad level. I think,

120
00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:57.480
you know my feelings about lockdowns at this point, there,

121
00:06:57.481 --> 00:06:59.450
there is no evidence that lockdowns work.

122
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:02.450
There's no evidence that keeping people trapped in their homes work. Um,

123
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.110
we know actually that it's increasing suicide and it's increasing depression and

124
00:07:06.111 --> 00:07:08.930
it's increasing alcoholism and all sorts of other bad behaviors.

125
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:10.610
And we know that people are actually gaining weight.

126
00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:14.330
They're not going to the gym as much. They're, they're not acting as healthy.

127
00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:18.020
There's all sorts of mental health stuff. We know all this stuff. Um,

128
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.640
but now we've shifted this to not just closing malls and closing,

129
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:26.600
um, you know, just the shoe store and restaurants.

130
00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:30.890
We're actually closing grocery stores. Now this is a dozen,

131
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.690
roughly a dozen stores in New Mexico.

132
00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:34.730
And there may be a little more to the story.

133
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.410
There may be a little more to the story, but this doesn't fly anymore.

134
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.490
And we, the people better start realizing what's going on here.

135
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:48.290
What right does your governor or your mayor have to tell you,

136
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:52.670
you cannot provide for your family in essence. That's what they're saying.

137
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:53.683
And by the way,

138
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.270
you know what two days from now is two days from now is Thanksgiving.

139
00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:01.400
The holiday where we in America give thanks for the freedoms we have

140
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:06.170
for the incredible 250 year history of joy and

141
00:08:06.171 --> 00:08:10.700
freedom and, and goodness and richness that we have,

142
00:08:10.701 --> 00:08:15.410
that is the jealousy the world over. And as we roll into Thanksgiving,

143
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:19.370
we are under the most extraordinary authoritarian lockdowns,

144
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:24.410
basically in the history of America. This is, this is prohibition on steroids.

145
00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:28.790
This is, this is, it's just extraordinary. It's being a prohibition by the way.

146
00:08:28.791 --> 00:08:30.230
We're not even covering this story today,

147
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:34.370
but the dingbat governor of Pennsylvania has decided that, uh,

148
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.150
starting tomorrow and I think 5:00 PM building no alcohol sales for,

149
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:40.910
for Thanksgiving. Like none of this makes sense.

150
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:44.780
There's no science that says that you can't have alcohol on Thanksgiving during

151
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:47.450
a pandemic or that you can't buy it just the day before. I mean,

152
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:48.920
there's gonna be a lot of people buying alcohol today.

153
00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:53.270
Like none of it makes sense and we're pretending it all makes sense.

154
00:08:53.271 --> 00:08:56.610
But this idea of the grocery stores and shutting down, you know,

155
00:08:56.611 --> 00:09:00.630
a place like Walmart, like these are places where people get essentials,

156
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.340
they get, they get diapers.

157
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:07.050
You don't just get food at a grocery store, right? There's other essentials.

158
00:09:07.051 --> 00:09:09.810
You might get some medicine there. You might get, band-aids all sorts of stuff.

159
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.810
And we are just letting these people do these things.

160
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.410
And I don't know what it's going to take for the average person to wake up.

161
00:09:16.411 --> 00:09:17.310
But as I said yesterday,

162
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:22.260
my hope is that we're just going to start seeing lots of little tea

163
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:27.180
parties popping up all over the United States. It may not be organized.

164
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.930
What I mean by that is the spirit, the spirit of the tea parties,

165
00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:34.920
that individual people and their local families and groups will start banding

166
00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:37.470
together and say, no more of this, no more of this.

167
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.130
We covered two stories yesterday about how people are doing that. We saw the,

168
00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:45.630
the people up in Buffalo who were kicking the regulators out of their

169
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.360
establishment because they had no right to be there. That was great.

170
00:09:48.361 --> 00:09:52.590
And then we saw the woman yelling at, uh, you know, uh, what's his name, uh,

171
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.690
Jersey governor Murphy. And it's like,

172
00:09:54.691 --> 00:09:57.330
I don't like people yelling at each other in public places.

173
00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.170
I think it's a little bit different with, uh, with public figures rather than,

174
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.860
than private citizens. Uh, anyway, none of this is going away, but let's,

175
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.450
let's shift this, uh,

176
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:11.040
to story number two for a moment because the Gavin Newsome the famous dinner at

177
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:14.460
French laundry, the thousand dollar a plate dinner, well,

178
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:19.080
the story gets even better. So this is from Adam Housley.

179
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.600
Who's a Fox news correspondent. Uh,

180
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:24.300
he uncovered that there were a couple things there.

181
00:10:24.301 --> 00:10:28.800
First off Newsome lied because there were 22 people at the dinner,

182
00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:29.910
not 12 people.

183
00:10:29.911 --> 00:10:34.410
Now this is at the same time where he's telling you that you PR shouldn't

184
00:10:34.411 --> 00:10:37.950
have more than 10 people over and you have to do this stuff outside.

185
00:10:37.951 --> 00:10:39.210
Of course they were indoors.

186
00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:42.270
And you can see the picture with the gorgeous chandelier and the fancy carpet

187
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.360
and the mirrors and the whole thing, not indoors. Uh,

188
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.830
he also said Adam Housley, that there was no social distancing surprise,

189
00:10:49.831 --> 00:10:54.180
surprise, and that there were, they weren't using masks, no surprise there. Uh,

190
00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:55.290
but the real kicker,

191
00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:00.510
the real kicker of this story is not that French laundry is super

192
00:11:00.511 --> 00:11:02.790
expensive and not that people go to expensive restaurants.

193
00:11:02.791 --> 00:11:05.100
I've been to some expensive restaurants in my day.

194
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.130
And if that's how you choose to spend your money, that's fantastic.

195
00:11:08.131 --> 00:11:10.890
And that's on you. That's wonderful. I'm a big food guy.

196
00:11:10.891 --> 00:11:13.830
You guys follow me on social media. You see,

197
00:11:13.831 --> 00:11:16.010
I'm always posting pictures of steaks and all,

198
00:11:16.011 --> 00:11:19.380
all sorts of fun stuff that that's just great. And I love good wine too.

199
00:11:19.381 --> 00:11:23.250
I'm not, besmirching the good people of Napa and Sonoma and Youngsville.

200
00:11:23.251 --> 00:11:24.810
I'm really not. Um,

201
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:29.070
but Gavin Newsome at this dinner where there were 22 people

202
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:32.190
indoors, not 12 people, not outdoors.

203
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:37.620
They're bar bill. That's the bill for the booze. That's the wine bill people.

204
00:11:37.621 --> 00:11:38.550
It was 15,

205
00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:43.560
$18,000 for 22 people.

206
00:11:43.561 --> 00:11:45.000
Now I'm not a Mathemagician here,

207
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.930
but that's about 750 bucks per person in booze. Now that's,

208
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.360
that's some seriously expensive wine. And again,

209
00:11:51.361 --> 00:11:54.460
I don't begrudge them that I believe in capitalism.

210
00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:57.760
I believe you're allowed to spend your hard earned money, however you wish.

211
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.550
But the irony of this one,

212
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:05.080
a B little dictator telling us stay at home,

213
00:12:05.081 --> 00:12:07.960
don't celebrate Thanksgiving. We're locking you down.

214
00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:11.800
We're shutting your restaurants and your businesses and all of those things.

215
00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:14.230
And what do we do while we're doing it?

216
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:19.450
We spend $15,000 on expensive wine at the exact

217
00:12:19.451 --> 00:12:20.830
same time. So, you know,

218
00:12:20.831 --> 00:12:25.780
I wrote out a line here for Gavin Newsome and I have my fancy glasses because I

219
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.210
want to, I want to get this just right. So Gavin,

220
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.300
I wrote it out here so that I can get it just right.

221
00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:35.080
But I do want to speak directly to Gavin Newsome,

222
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:42.370
go yourself. That was good.

223
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.950
That was good. That felt right. To me, that felt right to me. You know,

224
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:47.380
I try not to drop the F bomb that often, you know, I'm not,

225
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.720
I'm not like that Shapiro guy. He's afraid of saying it.

226
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:53.680
He won't say it publicly, but I felt that, that, you know, try it again.

227
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.980
Gavin Newsome go yourself.

228
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.570
It's better than CNN over here. People I'm telling you. All right. Uh,

229
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.630
let's talk about the third story. Let's just move on for a second. Oh, no,

230
00:13:10.631 --> 00:13:12.940
sorry. I wanna, I wanna jump back for just a little,

231
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.330
little bonus on this story because these lockdowns are happening all over the

232
00:13:16.331 --> 00:13:20.830
place. Uh, this is a video. I saw this on Twitter. It was catching fire,

233
00:13:20.831 --> 00:13:23.140
but of course you're not gonna see it on CNN. Of course,

234
00:13:23.141 --> 00:13:25.870
you're not gonna see it anywhere mainstream. Oh,

235
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.850
I think you'll see why you should see it there. Uh,

236
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.960
this is from a Twitter user called at the right Melissa on Twitter,

237
00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:36.400
who I noticed she actually does. She does follow me. And, uh, I believe,

238
00:13:36.401 --> 00:13:37.990
and we tried to find some more info on this,

239
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.260
but I believe this is from California. And as you know,

240
00:13:41.261 --> 00:13:45.970
we've got this 10 o'clock curfew here now. And this video is from two days ago.

241
00:13:45.971 --> 00:13:46.804
Let's take a look.

242
00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:52.200
<v 0>Not you guys ACL. It was fine. You know, off the street</v>

243
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:01.260
or you're getting arrested. You're under arrest

244
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.340
[inaudible] you guys are putting your knee in

245
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.110
[inaudible] I can't help it.

246
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.410
<v 1>I mean, if you don't think that that is chilling,</v>

247
00:14:49.411 --> 00:14:51.890
if you don't think that that is disturbing,

248
00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:55.130
if you don't think that that is evil, then I don't know what to say to you. Now,

249
00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:59.060
there might be some more context. We're trying to find out a little bit more,

250
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:01.790
but the line there go as the,

251
00:15:01.791 --> 00:15:05.660
as the officer is charging this man who's standing there in his bathrobe, uh,

252
00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:08.750
apparently a little bit after 10:00 PM go home,

253
00:15:08.751 --> 00:15:12.710
or you're getting arrested dot, dot, dot as the guy says, well,

254
00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.270
what's going on curfew.

255
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:20.030
Did that seem like a responsible or sensible response to somebody be

256
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:24.870
standing outside of their home after 10:00 PM in a free society?

257
00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.620
Did that seem right to you? Uh,

258
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.860
but yet we not only allow this to happen mainstream won't even show that.

259
00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:32.120
Now the irony of course,

260
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:36.740
is that I thought we have a problem with police brutality in this country.

261
00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.680
Don't we have a problem with these evil police officers who were murdering

262
00:15:39.681 --> 00:15:43.160
innocent people all over the place and abusing their power and authority.

263
00:15:43.161 --> 00:15:47.510
Isn't that? Isn't that a thing? Uh, well, I guess not in this case,

264
00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:52.070
cause the guy happened to be white and he was breaking the 10:00 PM curfew,

265
00:15:52.071 --> 00:15:54.560
which the power is at be really loved. So they won't even,

266
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.420
they won't even show you this clip.

267
00:15:56.421 --> 00:15:59.360
So obviously there may be a little more context there,

268
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.780
but I think you have enough to know that there's a guy just standing there and

269
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:06.710
also the way that the officer sort of points to the,

270
00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:10.400
to the camera man and says, Oh, you're okay. And Oh, and ACO,

271
00:16:10.401 --> 00:16:14.570
you guys are okay to break curfew, but this guy is not okay to break her.

272
00:16:14.571 --> 00:16:17.450
If you like, how do they decide who's allowed to break curfew or not?

273
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.200
And if this pandemic was so serious, if,

274
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.670
if the virus was spreading all over the place and just killing swaths of people

275
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:29.540
and not the didn't have the 99% recovery rate that it has,

276
00:16:29.541 --> 00:16:31.730
plus the vaccines that are on the way.

277
00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.190
Well then wouldn't you want everybody inside?

278
00:16:34.191 --> 00:16:38.120
You wouldn't want the camera man or the ACLU or anyone else. Oh,

279
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.490
by the way, watch the video again.

280
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.820
The assaulting officer who's committing the assault right there.

281
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:48.350
He's not wearing a mask, not wearing a mask, no mask that. Nope,

282
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:52.970
no mask, no mask. Oh anyway, guys, I mentioned this again.

283
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.070
I'm not trying to outrage you with these things.

284
00:16:55.071 --> 00:16:58.760
What I'm trying to do is just wake you up to some of the nonsense that

285
00:16:58.761 --> 00:17:01.700
mainstream media just won't cover. Um,

286
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.930
so you should find that video for yourself. Watch check the thread,

287
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.470
see what people are saying, find out more for yourself, but like just,

288
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.680
this is the broader point. The broader point is mainstream. As I say,

289
00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:14.900
it was so many of the things about the election.

290
00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:17.900
So many of the things that are just going on that we all know because of the

291
00:17:17.901 --> 00:17:19.220
internet for now, at least,

292
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:22.520
because I think the social media bannings are coming soon. Um,

293
00:17:22.521 --> 00:17:25.250
we know all these things in the media chooses to ignore them.

294
00:17:25.251 --> 00:17:30.020
And then that creates that schism, that schism, that leads us to the,

295
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.180
to the reality war that I'm always talking about. All right.

296
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:36.590
Speaking of reality, war journalists, as I always say,

297
00:17:36.591 --> 00:17:40.430
have destroyed journalism. What I mean by this is over the last four years,

298
00:17:40.431 --> 00:17:45.260
we have basically seen that most people who consider themselves journalists are

299
00:17:45.261 --> 00:17:48.260
not in fact journalists, they're they're Democrat operatives.

300
00:17:48.261 --> 00:17:52.680
That that is just very, very obvious. And you can see it for four years.

301
00:17:52.681 --> 00:17:56.690
People that were about orange man, bad and Hitler is coming.

302
00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.613
And all of these things,

303
00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.920
you can suddenly see how much nicer they're being because they think they have

304
00:18:00.921 --> 00:18:01.790
their guy in the,

305
00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:05.810
in the oval office coming they're incoming administration and Biden.

306
00:18:05.811 --> 00:18:07.070
It's going to be Democrats again.

307
00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.710
And Democrats are good and Republicans are bad.

308
00:18:09.711 --> 00:18:11.750
And this is why I kept saying the biggest,

309
00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:16.400
the biggest thing that Trump did was show Republicans how to fight back.

310
00:18:16.401 --> 00:18:19.280
And if Trump in fact does lose now, um,

311
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:22.760
I don't know what that means for the future of the Republican party, by the way,

312
00:18:22.761 --> 00:18:24.350
I still don't think the elections fully over.

313
00:18:24.351 --> 00:18:27.410
I still think there's some more surprises like this is 2020 people.

314
00:18:27.411 --> 00:18:30.380
If you don't think that it's got a couple of surprises left,

315
00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:34.190
I don't know what to tell you because this year is the year of the surprise,

316
00:18:34.191 --> 00:18:37.400
right? Uh, but I found this Twitter thread this morning.

317
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:41.990
That's so perfectly encapsulated. What is wrong with modern journalism?

318
00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:46.700
That it is this activist. And, and as Candace Owens says, they're not,

319
00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:49.280
they're not, she doesn't call them activists. She calls them Hitman.

320
00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:51.050
But in essence, what they are,

321
00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:55.640
they're very thinly guised journalists who really are just providing

322
00:18:55.641 --> 00:18:58.730
activism and pushing their own narrative constantly. So this is a,

323
00:18:58.731 --> 00:19:01.010
a Twitter thread by this guy, Jake Sherman.

324
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.080
Now his name's come up in my Twitter thread every now and again,

325
00:19:03.081 --> 00:19:08.060
I don't follow him, but he is a journalist from NBC and political.

326
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:10.820
And I want to pull up this whole thread that he had this morning,

327
00:19:10.821 --> 00:19:14.300
because it's just so perfect and such a perfect example of what I'm talking

328
00:19:14.301 --> 00:19:16.310
about, about how they cheerlead their guys.

329
00:19:16.311 --> 00:19:19.760
And they try to destroy the other guys. So Jake Sherman, he wrote playbook,

330
00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:23.060
the biggest shift. And Oh, by the way, note, as I read this,

331
00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:27.500
that this guy writes as if he's writing the preamble to star Wars with selective

332
00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.490
capitals, you know, you have to selectively capitalize certain words.

333
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.790
The first order it's coming back. Uh,

334
00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.250
the biggest shift in Washington in January,

335
00:19:37.251 --> 00:19:40.220
won't only be that Democrats are taking the white house.

336
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:44.990
It will be that the Biden administration will be as Brendan buck points out,

337
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:46.820
delightfully boring.

338
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:49.910
Now that doesn't really strike me as a statement of journalism. It's a,

339
00:19:49.911 --> 00:19:51.470
it's an editorial right there,

340
00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.590
Harris political calls it Joe Biden's team of careerist.

341
00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:57.350
Now he then lists out a bunch of people that,

342
00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.620
that Biden is potentially bringing into the administration. Okay.

343
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:05.660
This is an admin filled with people who have deep experience in government and

344
00:20:05.661 --> 00:20:08.540
in the agencies, they will be running the post,

345
00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:10.730
puts it this way by design.

346
00:20:10.731 --> 00:20:13.880
They seem meant to protect a dutiful competence.

347
00:20:13.881 --> 00:20:17.870
As Biden creates a government overseen by those who have run it before.

348
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.340
It sounds like a PR piece so far, they believe in a linear plotting,

349
00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:25.400
purposeful and standard policy process,

350
00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:30.470
impulsive policymaking and widespread leaks from competing factions in

351
00:20:30.471 --> 00:20:35.390
the administration are probably over expect interviews with Joe Biden

352
00:20:35.391 --> 00:20:38.240
to be a big deal, meaning they won't happen that often,

353
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.750
which gives them an extra ump will complain and they won't care.

354
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:44.600
His interview with Lester Holt on NBC will air tonight.

355
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:47.560
I think that one's particularly interesting because he's basically carrying

356
00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:47.891
water.

357
00:20:47.891 --> 00:20:51.880
Knowing Biden can't really do interviews because there's something wrong with

358
00:20:51.881 --> 00:20:54.760
him cognitively. And we all know it. So he's basically,

359
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:55.743
they're already leading us.

360
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:59.680
Joe won't even have to be seen that much because his team is going to be so

361
00:20:59.681 --> 00:21:02.290
competent that actually once a month,

362
00:21:02.291 --> 00:21:05.740
when they let him out from the basement and they hop them up on Adderall or

363
00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:08.770
whatever they're doing with him, then, then we'll let him speak. Uh,

364
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.780
but two more here. And then I think you'll really see the point.

365
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.670
We can't imagine he'll pop into the briefing room with regularity or tweet his

366
00:21:15.671 --> 00:21:18.580
emotions, thoughts or decision-making processes,

367
00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:23.110
statements of administration, policy SAP's statements of administration.

368
00:21:23.111 --> 00:21:27.490
Policy will again be a big deal because it will be how you know,

369
00:21:27.491 --> 00:21:29.800
what the administration is thinking on legislation.

370
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:34.390
So he's there already telling you the guy won't pop out for, uh,

371
00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.580
for talks. He's not going to take questions.

372
00:21:36.581 --> 00:21:38.470
They're telling you we're going to do his job.

373
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.590
We're going to carry water for him. He's our guy. And then finally,

374
00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:42.503
and this was the best part.

375
00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.690
You probably won't get conflicting signals from the white house about whether

376
00:21:46.691 --> 00:21:51.100
the president will sign a bill. If he works on it and his party, the agreement,

377
00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:54.340
he probably won't veto it at the last minute.

378
00:21:54.341 --> 00:21:57.190
Sorry that wasn't the last part where there, uh, Oh, you know,

379
00:21:57.191 --> 00:22:00.790
I don't have it here. Can you pull up that last part of it? I'll grab it here.

380
00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:03.310
I think I lost a sheet of paper because it's just so perfect.

381
00:22:03.311 --> 00:22:07.330
People bear with me for one second. I'm working hard over here today.

382
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:11.830
The last part of the thread says this. I almost got it here. One second.

383
00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:15.400
Sorry guys. Um, okay.

384
00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:20.530
It is unlikely to be an administration that has AIDS rushing to get on

385
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:24.040
TV, to praise the president. In fact, you will rarely see many of them,

386
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.570
many of these cabinet officials.

387
00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:28.780
So now they're saying we're not only going to hide Biden and not ask to see him,

388
00:22:28.781 --> 00:22:32.320
but we're also going to hide the officials. Do you see how twisted this is?

389
00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.250
How freaking twisted this is, but here, here was the end of it.

390
00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.400
This is just so perfect. This is just over.

391
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:42.520
If you have a barf bag to any of you have barf bags, Ben,

392
00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:43.630
you had been flying lately. You know,

393
00:22:43.631 --> 00:22:46.030
they leave a barf bag in the seat pocket in front of you.

394
00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:48.790
You may want to grab the barf bag because this is barf bag worthy.

395
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:50.530
In other words,

396
00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:55.600
if the Trump white house was like Downing a VAT of Tabasco sauce over the

397
00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:00.040
past four years, the Biden white house will be like sipping.

398
00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.360
Unflavored it?

399
00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:06.390
<v 2>And milk. Oh, this man Jake Sherman,</v>

400
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:08.400
he's pretend.

401
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.240
<v 1>Ending to be a journalist.</v>

402
00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:13.290
He is a democratic operative who setting the stage so that they'll never have to

403
00:23:13.291 --> 00:23:14.700
ask the president questions.

404
00:23:14.701 --> 00:23:18.780
They'll never have to ask his ministry administration questions. Trump.

405
00:23:18.781 --> 00:23:22.740
Remember that that was like drinking Tabasco sauce because we had to work.

406
00:23:22.741 --> 00:23:27.330
And we don't like orange man, but now we will sip almond milk. Well,

407
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.950
first off who sits almond milk?

408
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.930
I put a little almond milk in my coffee sometimes,

409
00:23:30.931 --> 00:23:33.990
but who's sipping almond milk. But all of that aside,

410
00:23:33.991 --> 00:23:35.260
do you see what this is the,

411
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:38.340
you see why I wanted to read this Twitter thread to you?

412
00:23:38.341 --> 00:23:43.170
It's not to make it about this one guy because every day there are a plethora,

413
00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:48.260
an unending splurge of these types of Twitter threads and

414
00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:49.460
stories from journalists.

415
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:54.560
But I think the biggest story of 2021 going forward will

416
00:23:54.561 --> 00:23:58.040
be if, if Joe Biden is to be president and I'm still putting the,

417
00:23:58.041 --> 00:24:01.400
if there and we still got to see what, uh, Sidney Powell has got.

418
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.820
We still got to see what Trump's team's got with with Giuliani and Jen Ellis and

419
00:24:04.821 --> 00:24:06.830
everything else. The election is not certified.

420
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.440
And I still think surprises are coming as I just said.

421
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:14.150
But I think really the biggest story of 2021 will be how quickly the media will

422
00:24:14.151 --> 00:24:18.860
just go back to being subservient pets and lapdogs

423
00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.520
to the Democrats. And then what will be even more dangerous than that. And Mark,

424
00:24:22.521 --> 00:24:27.380
my words on this guys is that if Biden is president January 20th,

425
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:31.280
that slowly after that, we are going to see mass social media.

426
00:24:31.281 --> 00:24:33.920
Bannings because what they're going to do is they're going to want to continue

427
00:24:33.921 --> 00:24:38.600
lockdowns and they will start making it seem that if you are not pro

428
00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:42.920
lockdown or if you were tweeting anti lockdown stuff or doing videos that are

429
00:24:42.921 --> 00:24:43.940
anti lockdown,

430
00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.600
they will make it seem like you are now a threat to public health.

431
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:50.720
And then the policies of the social media companies will to be,

432
00:24:50.721 --> 00:24:54.170
to ban new people that it's, it's all coming. Like it's all coming.

433
00:24:54.171 --> 00:24:56.120
I don't think this is paranoia or anything else,

434
00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.000
the best chance we have of stopping it is talking about it now.

435
00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:02.960
So that's exactly why I'm doing it. But by the way, uh, if,

436
00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.840
if you're worried about the Mannings and you want to stay in touch with me, uh,

437
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:08.900
we did, I did start a tech company in the midst of all of this. I don't,

438
00:25:08.901 --> 00:25:10.250
I don't just talk about these things.

439
00:25:10.251 --> 00:25:13.820
I actually do things and we started locals because of this.

440
00:25:13.821 --> 00:25:15.290
And you can go to Rubin report.com,

441
00:25:15.291 --> 00:25:17.870
which is powered by locals and directly communicate with me.

442
00:25:17.871 --> 00:25:21.680
That's where I actually respond to people because obviously it's impossible to

443
00:25:21.681 --> 00:25:22.131
do on,

444
00:25:22.131 --> 00:25:26.000
on the other things that are just overloaded with bots and trolls and haters and

445
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:28.880
blah, blah, blah, uh, anyway, guys, uh,

446
00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.730
be sure to check out part one of my interview with Nicole Arbor,

447
00:25:31.731 --> 00:25:33.740
which went up yesterday, people are absolutely loving her.

448
00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.590
You're not gonna believe this. She's a comedian. Who's absolutely funny.

449
00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:40.250
She's actually funny. It's it? You thought it was dead, but it's back.

450
00:25:40.251 --> 00:25:41.990
Nicole Arbor is a funny comedian.

451
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.080
I'm going to try to get on tour with her when this nonsense ends. At some point,

452
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:49.550
um, they, we will be live streaming tomorrow guys tomorrow, Wednesday,

453
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.680
and then we're shutting it down for Thanksgiving.

454
00:25:51.681 --> 00:25:56.090
And on Friday I want my guys to have off and I want to take off and enjoy some

455
00:25:56.091 --> 00:26:00.920
food and some family and friends. And I hope you guys, uh, will not be,

456
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:04.610
uh, online too much on Thursday and Friday. And even into the weekend,

457
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:09.560
like let's escape some of the madness and, uh, you know, be around food,

458
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.350
food, family, and friends. Those are three of the best four.

459
00:26:12.351 --> 00:26:15.860
F's see what I did there. All right guys. See you tomorrow.
