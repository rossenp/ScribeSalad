00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.240
<v 0>I remember I had Marianne Williamson on my show and I told her, you know,</v>

2
00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:06.810
I really don't watch the news. And she goes, that's, you need to watch the news.

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.660
Like you need to be informed, especially as like a white male,

4
00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:11.340
you need to know what's happening in the world.

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.440
And the moment you can get the news from different places.

6
00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:18.120
I don't need to watch the TV to get the news. I can check, you know,

7
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:21.270
Apple news or whatever, or get someone to tweet me something and check it out.

8
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.430
And people are to tell you the news, no matter what.

9
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.170
<v 1>Right, right. You can't, you can't really escape the news. I try to focus on.</v>

10
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.970
<v 0>I truly believe that when I focus on giving to people and service,</v>

11
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.220
I'm a happier human being. And,

12
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.200
and research has backed science of happiness that when you're in contribution to

13
00:00:39.201 --> 00:00:41.900
someone else, whether it's opening the door, buying a coffee,

14
00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:42.910
having a conversation,

15
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.940
listening to someone when they're going through something, doing charity work,

16
00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:49.760
whatever it may be that makes you the happiest when we're giving to others.

17
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.770
<v 1>So I don't want to do straight up politics.</v>

18
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.300
I did not get an essay book of the things that you won't talk about,

19
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.080
but I don't want to do politics because I think it's a good escape. This is,

20
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.760
this is meta politics course. Um, but in a time,

21
00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:16.880
like we live in right now where politics seems crazy,

22
00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:19.670
everyone's trying to destroy each other, all of those things.

23
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.500
Do you have any tricks that you use for yourself or that you've recommended to

24
00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:26.810
other people to scale back? I mean,

25
00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:30.740
one of the things I try to show people is that your worldview just can't be

26
00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:34.160
political. You, you, you know, if your worldview is just politics,

27
00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:35.090
you're always doing this,

28
00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:39.200
you've got blinders on and you need a much bigger philosophical, religious,

29
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.350
whatever it is, whatever your worldview is, it needs to be much wider.

30
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.130
Do you have any tricks? Because it seems like everyone everywhere.

31
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.560
And I know I'm sort of self-selected into the stage.

32
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.950
When anyone sees me at the store, they want to talk politics. But,

33
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.020
but I do sense people. It's making people crazier. It's making people angrier.

34
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.711
Uh, you know,

35
00:01:57.711 --> 00:02:01.040
they just released this big study about how depressed people are right now. And.

36
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.140
<v 0>I, uh,</v>

37
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.130
I remember when I started being an entrepreneur, um,

38
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.660
after leaving my brothers,

39
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.440
I pay two 50 a month for my brother's place to have a room from his place.

40
00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:16.460
Right. And I started making enough money to get an apartment for, uh,

41
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.140
four 95 a month. And it was the scariest thing to write a check for four 95.

42
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.120
Cause I was like, I don't know how I'm going to pay this next month.

43
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.440
But I got the cheapest department I could in Columbus, Ohio. Um, and I remember,

44
00:02:27.441 --> 00:02:29.480
and I didn't have a car at the time. So I was walking everywhere.

45
00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:32.000
And I remember saying to myself, I'm not going to get a TV.

46
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.150
And the first few years I didn't have a TV.

47
00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:38.720
And I just focused on my mission and my vision, which was creation,

48
00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:43.250
which was getting customers and sales and adding value to those customers and

49
00:02:43.251 --> 00:02:47.000
clients and not having a TV was a big blessing.

50
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.450
I love movies and I love TV. So I would go to the movies all the time,

51
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:55.220
but I wouldn't allow myself to browse and see chaos on a screen

52
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.790
until midnight, and then go to sleep with nightmares from the,

53
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.500
so personally, I try to,

54
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.790
I remember I had Marianne Williamson on my show and I told her, you know,

55
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:10.360
I really don't watch the news. And she goes, that's, you need to watch the news.

56
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.210
Like you need to be informed, especially as like a white male,

57
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:14.890
you need to know what's happening in the world.

58
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.990
And the moment you can get the news from different places.

59
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:21.670
I don't need to watch the TV to get the news. I can check, you know,

60
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:24.820
Apple news or whatever, or get someone to tweet me something and check it out.

61
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.380
And people are gonna tell you the news, no matter what, right. You can't,

62
00:03:28.381 --> 00:03:30.600
you can't really escape the news. I try to focus on. Yeah.

63
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.520
I truly believe that when I focus on giving to people and service,

64
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.770
I'm a happier human being. And,

65
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.750
and research has backed science of happiness that when you're in contribution to

66
00:03:42.751 --> 00:03:45.450
someone else, whether it's opening the door, buying a coffee,

67
00:03:45.451 --> 00:03:46.500
having a conversation,

68
00:03:46.501 --> 00:03:50.490
listening to someone when they're going through something, doing charity work,

69
00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:53.400
whatever it may be that makes you the happiest when we're giving to others.

70
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.560
So when we're focused on self and what we don't have suffering is the

71
00:03:58.561 --> 00:04:02.850
result of obsessive. Self-centric thinking. So when I'm thinking of the news,

72
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.500
this is not working in my favor. I need to, this is an outrage,

73
00:04:07.501 --> 00:04:10.410
or I'm not happy about this because it's not helping me.

74
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.910
You're going to be unhappy.

75
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.370
And I'm not saying you shouldn't fight for what you want and, and,

76
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.570
and have things to change. Sure. But if you're going to be,

77
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.630
if you want to be happier, focus on other people,

78
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.770
focused on service and also don't watch the news.

79
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.250
And as media companies, ourselves, we won't be able to watch us.

80
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.530
But I think watch, um,

81
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.270
focus on things that bring you joy. I think as adults,

82
00:04:36.271 --> 00:04:39.810
we don't play enough. You know, in my, in my studio,

83
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.530
I've got a Frisbee and I'll, and we love to work hard. You know,

84
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.040
our team works hard, but I'll grab Matt or CLL or my friend. And I say,

85
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.140
we need five minutes just to throw the Frisbee.

86
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.550
Like we need to play who plays anymore. Especially if we can't go outside,

87
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.330
you can't do this. Who's playing well, I'm chasing a one-year-old dog. Exactly.

88
00:04:57.331 --> 00:05:00.960
Right. So that, but I'm like a big advocate of play.

89
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.100
We're watching TV, go do something fun.

90
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.640
I went out to was it I've been in LA for eight years.

91
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.730
How long have you been here? Uh, about eight years. Eight years. Seven,

92
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.360
literally two days ago. First time I went to, uh,

93
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.480
Franklin Canyon Lake or park. Have you been in this place?

94
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.900
I don't even know what that is. This is 10 minutes from here.

95
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.040
It's a Lake and nature of like a hundred acres in the middle of LA.

96
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.000
You can't see the city. It's literally in the middle of Mohan drive.

97
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.960
Never heard of this place. It's unbelievable. I saw a photo of an audience.

98
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.990
We got a link there.

99
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.350
We got a Lake and it's like ducks and turtles and everything. Yeah.

100
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.130
And I went there on Sunday with my girlfriend and our dog. And it was just like,

101
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.530
we're in nature. We're hanging out. I'm not watching TV.

102
00:05:43.531 --> 00:05:48.240
I'm not on social media. I'm a big salsa dancer. I love slowly.

103
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.560
For 15 years of my salsa dancing around the world. I play guitar.

104
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.530
I like to play sports workout. I'm just like,

105
00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.320
go do something that's going to and benefit your life and contribute and benefit

106
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:02.690
someone else's life. When you do those things,

107
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.450
you're going to be a better person. I'm learning Spanish.

108
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:08.990
I'm trying all these different things that give me a way from the train wreck of

109
00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:12.470
the news. So that's what I recommend. Don't obsess yourself into.

110
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:14.360
What's not working for you. Go be the change.

111
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.300
<v 1>Do you sense that right now? Because of grown-up protests,</v>

112
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.660
because everything is, is so seemingly chaotic,

113
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.560
that people are becoming more receptive to the type of stuff you're talking

114
00:06:26.561 --> 00:06:28.750
about. Because I can just, for me,

115
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.680
like I started gardening since we started doing this.

116
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.460
I'll show you when we get out here, we got a ton of it.

117
00:06:33.461 --> 00:06:37.030
We're growing a ton of great stuff out there. I got carrots, I got,

118
00:06:37.031 --> 00:06:41.290
I got tomatoes, I got cucumbers. I got zucchini. I got broccoli, uh, peppers.

119
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.930
But like I started doing that. I'm cooking a lot more.

120
00:06:43.931 --> 00:06:46.630
David usually cooks a ton, but now I'm barbecuing all the time.

121
00:06:46.631 --> 00:06:48.820
And like I'm refining some skills. And like,

122
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.980
I think there's a unique opportunity in this mess to either come out of it,

123
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.150
more skilled, more refined, more passionate about what you do,

124
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.750
or maybe realize that what you were doing before and what you want to do were

125
00:07:01.751 --> 00:07:02.584
all that stuff.

126
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.310
Versus some people that I think are just gonna have slogged through it and not

127
00:07:06.311 --> 00:07:08.980
really thought about their life critically enough.

128
00:07:08.981 --> 00:07:10.600
And then they'll just be on the other side in the world.

129
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.290
<v 0>I'm on both sides here. I, if you,</v>

130
00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:18.640
if you need to take a pause and rest for these last three months,

131
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.030
because you've been, go, go, go, go, go nonstop for 10 years.

132
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.920
And you had never taken a pause in your life.

133
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.550
This is the most beautiful time for you to sit around and do nothing and read a

134
00:07:27.551 --> 00:07:30.820
book and lounge and not hustle. So for some people,

135
00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:34.210
I think that is what you need. And personally,

136
00:07:34.211 --> 00:07:38.260
my philosophy is I feel like this is what the world needed in general is for us

137
00:07:38.261 --> 00:07:42.130
to take a pause with technology being so fast with us on social media.

138
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.070
Most people are on their phones, six, seven, eight hours a day.

139
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.850
And a lot of it's social media. It's like, what are we consuming our time with?

140
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.490
It's not what we're supposed to be doing all day.

141
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.250
Pretty sure it's not making us happier. It's something that's happier.

142
00:07:54.251 --> 00:07:55.840
It's making us more neurotic of like,

143
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.550
I need more likes and more followers I need to, Oh,

144
00:07:57.551 --> 00:08:01.810
what's happening in the news. It's just, it's craziness. And so for some,

145
00:08:01.811 --> 00:08:04.630
I think don't do anything. And that's what you need.

146
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.770
You need to reevaluate why your life isn't working, why this relation,

147
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.570
I'm seeing so many people. I'm not sure if you're seeing this,

148
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.200
a lot of big personalities are posting. We're getting a divorce.

149
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.090
We're going through a breakup. You're finally evaluating your relationship.

150
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:19.501
<v 1>What's the point. You're,</v>

151
00:08:19.501 --> 00:08:21.940
you're trapped in a house with someone every minute for three months,

152
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.380
go and do it. Do I like this?

153
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.640
<v 0>You can't escape anymore.</v>

154
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.210
So I think people are getting clear on what they want because they haven't been

155
00:08:28.211 --> 00:08:30.760
clear for a long time, maybe partly but not fully.

156
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.930
So for some people you need a pause. You need a break. You need to evaluate,

157
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:38.860
you need to take inventory of everything in your life and create a new game

158
00:08:38.861 --> 00:08:39.700
plan. Moving forward.

159
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.730
You need to find some coaches and mentors and have a game plan and go take

160
00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:46.510
action for other people. I'm kind of in the middle.

161
00:08:46.511 --> 00:08:50.980
I feel like I've hustled more. My business, I've hired more people.

162
00:08:50.981 --> 00:08:52.840
I've been like more creative than ever,

163
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:57.180
but I'm also going to the park and with my girlfriend, my dog on the weekends,

164
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.900
which I would never do. And I'm taking that time to be in nature.

165
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.600
So I feel like I'm trying to do both and bounce my personal life,

166
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:06.450
but then work going kind of all in and getting clear, like,

167
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.150
what is our audience need right now? What does our customers need?

168
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.000
What are the need for the next five to 10 years? If this doesn't change.

169
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.480
So I'm a little in the middle and I have empathy for both sides,

170
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:19.260
but I think if you can rediscover what you want to do in your life and who you

171
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:22.920
want to become, whether you take action on it now, or just discover it now,

172
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.053
that's what.

173
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.860
<v 1>How do you decide how much stuff to put out there in the midst of all this?</v>

174
00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.980
Because a lot of what you're talking about is to ease up on this stuff,

175
00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.550
go live your life, get out there in nature, et cetera, et cetera.

176
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:37.640
I think I mentioned to you last time, like people say to me, Dave,

177
00:09:37.641 --> 00:09:40.790
why don't you do an interview every day, do five interviews a week,

178
00:09:40.791 --> 00:09:42.890
do seven interviews a week. And we do one or two.

179
00:09:42.891 --> 00:09:46.520
And then I obviously do some other stuff. And I, it's not for a lack of time,

180
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.390
but it really, in many cases for a respect of my audience, people saw.

181
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.290
Yeah. Like it's. Cause I it's like if you listen to me,

182
00:09:54.291 --> 00:09:56.210
then hopefully you listened to one of your episodes.

183
00:09:56.211 --> 00:09:59.210
Maybe you listen to Sam Harris or Joe Rogan or whatever. It's like,

184
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.080
I want you to, that's great. If you give a couple hours a week to this stuff,

185
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:07.820
that's fantastic, but I don't want you to give 40 hours of your week to,

186
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.730
I don't even want you to give 20 hours of your week to, to this. So like,

187
00:10:10.731 --> 00:10:13.700
I think it's important what we're doing, it's valuable what we're doing,

188
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:18.110
but how do you decide like what's enough and what's too much.

189
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.440
<v 0>Three factors. One is like, what is my audience?</v>

190
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.590
What I think my audience wants and my intuitive side of what they think they are

191
00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:28.550
going to want or need what works for me personally.

192
00:10:28.551 --> 00:10:30.890
Like I don't want to be on every day doing an interview either.

193
00:10:30.891 --> 00:10:34.640
It's a lot of energy. What personally works for my life and my lifestyle,

194
00:10:34.641 --> 00:10:37.100
my vision for the future. And then what does the data say?

195
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.350
<v 3>If you'd like to be inspired, motivated,</v>

196
00:10:39.351 --> 00:10:42.950
