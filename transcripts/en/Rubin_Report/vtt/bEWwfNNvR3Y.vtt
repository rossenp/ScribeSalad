1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.140
<v 0>There are a lot of people in the press.</v>

2
00:00:01.141 --> 00:00:04.470
And I know you would agree with us that have really abused their position of

3
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:07.440
power. And it is a position of power.

4
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.470
I will never forget the story of this elderly lady.

5
00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:12.210
And I wrote about it in my book, uh,

6
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.850
this elderly woman who had a Facebook group,

7
00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:17.040
that was a pro-Trump Facebook group. I mean, you know,

8
00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:18.750
she can do whatever she wants. She can play Farmville.

9
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:21.840
She can do a pro-Trump Facebook group. And, um,

10
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.550
CNN showed up at her house and they did on her there.

11
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:31.320
Her address was displayed on camera and she ended up getting threats.

12
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:35.280
And I'm, I I'm thinking what, because you don't like her political affiliation,

13
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:39.990
you decide to abuse your authority as a way to really intimidate people

14
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:43.350
into not engaging in a right. That they have,

15
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.300
that that's bothersome.

16
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.490
<v 2>Let's talk about the press a little bit sort of main stream. Um,</v>

17
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.580
everyone's watching it collapse. Everyone's watching, you know,

18
00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:05.000
the quote unquote journalist destroy journalism. Um,

19
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.030
does this thing just need to flame out, uh, you know,

20
00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:11.780
if you would have asked me maybe six months ago, I was still on the, Oh,

21
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.550
this thing can be fixed wagon or at least that we should still be trying to

22
00:01:16.551 --> 00:01:20.060
fix it. And now after Corona, I'm just like,

23
00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:23.690
and after what Chuck Todd did, uh, in the last couple of weeks with, uh,

24
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:27.200
with Bob BARR and just like watching the rest of it, it's like, you know what,

25
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.090
maybe just let it crumble.

26
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.940
And while I think there's major risks on the other side,

27
00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:34.130
if we have nothing that's mainstream, it's like,

28
00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:38.090
what gives us national cohesion? It's like, why are we saving this thing?

29
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.440
Or are you in that space?

30
00:01:39.441 --> 00:01:42.530
Or do you think that there's something worth saving or somewhat so mixed? Maybe.

31
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.870
<v 0>It's kind of a mix.</v>

32
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.070
I don't ever think that the press has been unbiased ever even since its

33
00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:53.690
inception. I mean, I think of the funny little ways that they used to,

34
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.440
like during the days of our founding, that the, uh,

35
00:01:57.441 --> 00:02:01.280
that folks would go after each other, politicians would write nasty editorials,

36
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.100
which were so much more scandalous than some of the stuff that we see.

37
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.713
I mean that.

38
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.540
<v 2>You got syphilis, like a whole bunch of stuff. Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.800
<v 0>Colonial Housewives come to life. That's what it seemed like.</v>

40
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.720
It was crazy. Uh, I don't think that they've ever been unbiased.

41
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.770
I do think that they maybe perhaps have been a little bit more attentive to the

42
00:02:21.771 --> 00:02:25.010
needs of the people because at one point the press was the people, the press,

43
00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:29.570
and the people kind of were hand in hand and the press was the people's way to

44
00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:31.160
keep check on their government.

45
00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:36.050
And now it's dissolved into party allegiances and a lot of the

46
00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:37.670
press, and there have been surveys.

47
00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:41.840
The majority of them identify politically one way as opposed to the other.

48
00:02:41.841 --> 00:02:43.490
And I don't even have a problem with that.

49
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.470
The problem that I have is the egos of so many of these individuals who seem to

50
00:02:48.471 --> 00:02:52.640
think that the byline is the most important thing on a piece,

51
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.570
as opposed to the information that the piece is sharing and or supposed to

52
00:02:56.571 --> 00:02:57.290
share.

53
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.020
And so many of these Q A's with the president turned into some kind of

54
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:06.190
footage for a reporter to, uh, aggrandized themselves and,

55
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:10.510
and make a story out of themselves. Or it's all prop it's, you know,

56
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:14.770
political propaganda. And it's, it's frustrating because I always feel, uh,

57
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.011
you know,

58
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:19.900
a free press is a sacred thing and I will defend that to the

59
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:22.270
end, but are they free though,

60
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.280
when they cannot report on things outside of that, that political filter,

61
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.480
when everything has to run through that party affiliation is that really free

62
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:32.314
reporting.

63
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.210
And I also think that criticism of the press seems to be taboo now,

64
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.460
but a lot of people in the press don't seem to understand that a free press and

65
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:44.740
a free people's right to criticize their free press.

66
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:47.590
These are things that go hand in hand. You can't have one without the other,

67
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.240
and you can't criticize our criticism of you without kind of ultimately what

68
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:55.870
betraying your principles. So I wish I don't, like I said,

69
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:58.960
I don't mind bias when it's honest,

70
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.810
but I don't want people to report something and have it be politically,

71
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:09.700
you know, one cited and then try to rely on the credit earned by a previous

72
00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:13.960
media generation back when they at least attempted to not place so much emphasis

73
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:18.320
on the byline or who was anchoring the news at that particular point. And,

74
00:04:18.321 --> 00:04:19.270
and really just,

75
00:04:19.271 --> 00:04:22.900
I wish that they would just focus on the information and if they want to do

76
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:26.440
editorial do editorial, like I'm not a journalist. I, I'm not a hard,

77
00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:31.270
I'm not a hard reporter. I am an, editorialist an analyst.

78
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.460
I, I am so biased. It's crazy,

79
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.020
but I admit it and I'll be honest with people about it, but just, just, just,

80
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:41.440
I want them to do the same as well. Just be honest about it.

81
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.440
<v 2>I think people get confused when people attack the media.</v>

82
00:04:46.441 --> 00:04:49.740
There seems to be this idea that if people like you and I attack the media,

83
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.450
that somehow we're part of the problem or the other version of this is like,

84
00:04:54.451 --> 00:04:56.670
when, when Trump fights with everyone at CNN,

85
00:04:56.671 --> 00:05:00.360
he's fighting with Jim Acosta and people are like, he's attacking the press.

86
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.790
And it's like, well, I actually have no problem with that.

87
00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:04.890
He has first amendment rights to now,

88
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.400
if he was using the power of the government, obviously to silence them, well,

89
00:05:08.401 --> 00:05:13.140
now we got a problem. Um, but he, as far as I know, he's not doing that yet.

90
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.540
They love to play the victim too. And it's like,

91
00:05:15.541 --> 00:05:19.920
what happens in America constantly is that everyone is exercising their free

92
00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:23.670
speech all the time. I mean, we could get to the big tech problem,

93
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.690
maybe in a moment, but like that, the way it actually is working,

94
00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:31.260
Trump fighting with them, them attacking Trump, us attacking them.

95
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.690
You may not love the whole game. And it may be,

96
00:05:33.691 --> 00:05:36.330
it may be something that burns too hot, you know?

97
00:05:36.331 --> 00:05:38.280
So it's eventually going to explode or something,

98
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.320
but like everyone's free speech is being, you know, protected basically.

99
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.440
<v 0>No, I think that's a good point. I mean, isn't that,</v>

100
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.850
isn't that what it's all about? I mean,

101
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.660
America has always been kind of like a big giant family arguing at the dinner

102
00:05:51.661 --> 00:05:55.710
table and it makes it infuriating, but also amazing. I mean,

103
00:05:55.711 --> 00:05:59.030
I wouldn't change it for the world. That's what it's supposed to be like.

104
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.030
But this idea that you're, you know,

105
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.120
if you criticize or the press for bad reporting,

106
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:07.460
and there are numerous examples of bad reporting,

107
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.230
there are entire media entities on the right that exists to document

108
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.630
legitimate cases of biased reporting.

109
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.520
And that that's not attacking anyone. They act like they're on a battlefield.

110
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.430
And as they're trying to eat their MRE, they're, you know,

111
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:26.480
being hit with missiles from the president or from a Republican or whatever,

112
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.930
because they dared to write a bad story. I mean there, and that's,

113
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:32.270
that's the point of it. We it's like we also,

114
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.270
in addition to keeping our politicians honest, we have to keep our press honest.

115
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.360
And I feel like we were sold a bill that was a bad sale.

116
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.990
Like we were supposed to have them as an ally instead of now,

117
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:44.420
because they had really, there are a lot of people in the press.

118
00:06:44.421 --> 00:06:47.750
And I know you would agree with us that have really abused their position of

119
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:50.720
power. And it is a position of power.

120
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.720
I will never forget the story of this elderly lady.

121
00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:55.490
And I wrote about it in my book, uh,

122
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.840
this elderly woman who had a Facebook group that was a pro-Trump Facebook group.

123
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.030
I mean, you know, she can do whatever she wants. She can play Farmville.

124
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:05.090
She can do a pro-Trump Facebook group. And, um,

125
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.800
CNN showed up at her house and they did on her there,

126
00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:14.600
her address was displayed on camera and she ended up getting threats.

127
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.560
And I'm, I I'm thinking what, because you don't like her political affiliation,

128
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:23.240
you decide to abuse your authority as a way to really intimidate people

129
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:26.600
into not engaging in a right, that they have,

130
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.890
that that's bothersome. You know, I've been the victim of press bias.

131
00:07:30.891 --> 00:07:32.660
You've been the victim of press bias.

132
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.020
I don't think there's anyone that is in this industry that hasn't been affected.

133
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.970
Um, but the idea that any kind of criticism of them means that they are being

134
00:07:40.971 --> 00:07:43.630
persecuted. I would have to say, well, you know, there,

135
00:07:43.631 --> 00:07:47.930
there is a definitive history as to who re who, who started what,

136
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.890
and it wasn't the people who attacked, uh, by, uh, an unbiased price.

137
00:07:51.891 --> 00:07:55.640
It was the people who started pointing out some really unfair and nasty articles

138
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:59.420
that had been written. So I don't give a lot of credence to,

139
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:02.450
and when they're unfairly attacked, I'll definitely speak up,

140
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.250
but not every one of those attacks are unfair or criticisms are unfair.

141
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.020
<v 2>So that's actually a perfect segue to the outrage part of this.</v>

142
00:08:11.021 --> 00:08:13.630
So as I'm doing all my press for my book,

143
00:08:13.631 --> 00:08:18.040
one of the things that people are asking me constantly is when did the

144
00:08:18.041 --> 00:08:22.600
outrage thing start? Is there a moment that you can point to that it started,

145
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.090
I have a couple of different answers for it.

146
00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.970
Cause I think there's a few things that led up to it. Um,

147
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.710
but do you see like a moment or a political movement or a person that

148
00:08:32.711 --> 00:08:36.220
sort of got us into this mess that now we all see.

149
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:37.960
<v 0>Ooh,</v>

150
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.680
that's a good question because it feels like people have been outraged for so

151
00:08:41.681 --> 00:08:45.160
long, even since the, you know, George W. Bush years, even,

152
00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:49.750
maybe even going back to Reagan. People have been outraged for a long time.

153
00:08:49.751 --> 00:08:53.770
I remember going the first time I was ever at the Reagan library and I was

154
00:08:53.771 --> 00:08:56.130
looking at, at one of the exhibits,

155
00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.460
it was about some of the media bias towards Reagan and those headlines were

156
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:04.050
nasty. And he would say one thing or look one particular way.

157
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:05.460
And there were headlines about it.

158
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.140
I do think that it's grown to include almost every aspect of life.

159
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:14.430
So it's it's instead of it just being a reaction, it's now a culture.

160
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:19.590
And when that occurred, I, I, I don't know,

161
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.300
maybe sometime after George W. Bush,

162
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.430
it's one of those things where it's been around for so long,

163
00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:25.710
we don't realize that we are in it. We haven't,

164
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.220
we don't realize how long we've been in it. I, when do you think it started?

165
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:33.740
<v 2>So I, I have a couple of different answers on this, but I think, you know,</v>

166
00:09:33.741 --> 00:09:35.630
as you know, my story, so as a lefty,

167
00:09:35.631 --> 00:09:37.910
I was very much in like the progressive thing.

168
00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:42.440
And I think it was sort of the first time Bernie came around,

169
00:09:42.441 --> 00:09:47.300
he ignited, although I don't think he himself was realizing what he was doing.

170
00:09:47.301 --> 00:09:52.040
Exactly. He ignited this like thing that was laying underneath this, like,

171
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.880
like there was Tinder basically underneath that he ignited that sort of

172
00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:00.020
everything in America was bad. And that once you do that,

173
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:04.970
you couple that with identity politics, you couple that with,

174
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:08.270
you know, 20 years or almost three decades,

175
00:10:08.271 --> 00:10:11.840
maybe of kids being told that they can never lose and their feelings matter and

176
00:10:11.841 --> 00:10:13.280
participation trophies,

177
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:18.170
and basically all of these things that then as we became more

178
00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.050
hyper-partisan and then you finally, you throw Trump onto it,

179
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.410
which I think he was just a symptom of it, not the cause of it,

180
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.960
but that I think is why the last five years. Oh.

181
00:10:26.961 --> 00:10:28.760
And then of course you throw social media into it.

182
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.910
So I don't know that there's an exact moment, but it was like,

183
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:33.530
it was like partisan.

184
00:10:33.531 --> 00:10:38.420
Leftiness coupled with sort of the collapse of the decent liberal you throw

185
00:10:38.421 --> 00:10:41.090
in social media, you throw in trolls, you throw in bots,

186
00:10:41.091 --> 00:10:43.400
you throw in Trump who wants to play that game.

187
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.250
You throw in the dishonest media. And we just, it was like, we,

188
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.390
it was almost like we summoned this thing. We all sort of did it together.

189
00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.600
