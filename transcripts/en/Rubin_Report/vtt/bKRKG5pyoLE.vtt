00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
<v 0>So one of the, one of the things that people often tell me, well, you know,</v>

2
00:00:02.581 --> 00:00:06.600
you're protected by tenure professor, so it doesn't take such courage. Dr. Side.

3
00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:10.500
Well, in 2017, I had to, well,

4
00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:13.380
whenever I would go to teach courses on campus,

5
00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:15.360
I had to be accompanied by security,

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.650
but would then lock the door of my class so that if people left the room,

7
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.760
they'd have to knock to be let back in because of the number of death threats I

8
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:27.900
was getting, when I would leave campus, when my wife would come to pick me up,

9
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.070
I would literally have something akin to kind of a deflation from an anxiety

10
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:35.190
attack, because I didn't know when they were going to come at me.

11
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.780
What upsets me about some of our common friends is that they're not willing to

12
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:48.750
entertain that conversation, which by the way,

13
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:51.360
speaks to an important thing in my book,

14
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:54.990
which is the fact that you are educated and intelligent,

15
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.880
doesn't serve as an inoculation against you being parasitized by idea

16
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:00.630
pathogens,

17
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.440
because many of our common friends have PhDs and they're accomplished and

18
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:06.390
they've written great books. And guess what?

19
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.990
They're some of the biggest sufferers of ostrich parasitic syndrome.

20
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.640
<v 1>Yeah. And that's not to throw anyone under the bus. I mean, this is,</v>

21
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.790
this is purely just to, I think,

22
00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:19.640
continue to try to wake people up to some of this stuff.

23
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.430
<v 0>Exactly. I look at some of our common friends with whom I have, by the way,</v>

24
00:01:25.431 --> 00:01:25.791
yesterday,

25
00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:29.930
I put up a thing where I was defending Richard Dawkins for having been the

26
00:01:29.931 --> 00:01:34.490
platform at Trinity college, Dublin and a whole bunch of people. Yeah,

27
00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:37.310
it's crazy. So people were sending me angry emails saying, well,

28
00:01:37.311 --> 00:01:39.260
why are you defending him? You know,

29
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.770
how he was going crazy about Trump or how he's going crazy about Brexit?

30
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.180
The fact that I defend him because of a universal principle,

31
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.470
doesn't imply that I have to agree or disagree with him on every other issue.

32
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.940
And the fact that I have to enunciate this clearly to you shows you how

33
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.320
parasitized most people are.

34
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.670
<v 1>20 Years ago, when you, when you were first teaching about this stuff.</v>

35
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.550
And even before that, when you were in school learning about all of this,

36
00:02:04.551 --> 00:02:06.170
did you ever think that this was,

37
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.050
that you were going to be talking about politics because you,

38
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.340
you spend a lot of time, you know,

39
00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:12.050
it's not that you're talking about politics all the time,

40
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.860
but everything is now political and you talk about politics on Twitter.

41
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:17.690
And when I bring you on, or you go on other shows,

42
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.700
people ask you your thoughts on politics. Are you,

43
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.210
or does that seem like it was going to be the obvious end of all of this,

44
00:02:23.211 --> 00:02:25.700
that because of the way it spreads that it would end up there?

45
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.710
<v 0>No, I don't.</v>

46
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.310
I would be lying if I said I had the foresight of where my engagement was going

47
00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:36.170
to go. What was clear from my training is I was studying psychology of

48
00:02:36.171 --> 00:02:38.030
decision-making. So one of the things,

49
00:02:38.031 --> 00:02:40.040
when you study psychology of decision making,

50
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.310
one of the things you do is you study what's called rational choice.

51
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.170
So for example, if I prefer car a to car B and I prefer car B to car C,

52
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.720
it has to be that I prefer car eight or car seat.

53
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.040
That's called the trance activity. Axiom. If I violate this order of preference,

54
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.000
that I am being quote irrational. So part of my training,

55
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.580
my doctoral studies was to study psychology of decision-making or behavioral

56
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:04.750
decision theory, which by the way,

57
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:08.960
led to a Nobel prize to one of my professors at Cornell, uh,

58
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.640
Richard Fayler. And so I come from, from a group of folks,

59
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.150
several of whom have won the Nobel prize for demonstrating that economic

60
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.860
decision-making is sometimes faulty.

61
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.870
So it was already part of my training to study irrational behavior.

62
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.970
But what was a surprise to me was that the irrationality would seep its

63
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:31.540
way from this very circumscribed script, you know,

64
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.340
mathematical Axiom to politics, to popular culture.

65
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.360
So in a sense, I was trained to look at human irrationality.

66
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.610
I just didn't know that I would go into all these different things.

67
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.980
<v 1>Yeah. Have you been, uh, we we've talked about this a little bit,</v>

68
00:03:46.981 --> 00:03:51.030
but since I haven't had you on for probably maybe it's eight or 10 months or

69
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.410
something around there, maybe, maybe even longer, um,

70
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.810
can you just talk a little bit about what it's like,

71
00:03:57.811 --> 00:04:01.350
just sort of in the world of academia right now and just dealing with other

72
00:04:01.351 --> 00:04:06.060
professors and have you been ostracized by other people and, and the other,

73
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.710
other kinds of headaches, because I think humanizing some of that stuff, you're,

74
00:04:09.711 --> 00:04:13.500
you're, you know, you're not just some spinning a neuron out there.

75
00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:17.100
You're a human, you've got a family and people you work with and the rest of it,

76
00:04:17.101 --> 00:04:18.420
it's not that this has no cost.

77
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.320
<v 0>I'd say a very good looking human, but yes, uh.</v>

78
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.020
<v 1>Gorgeous runs, man.</v>

79
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.470
<v 0>Uh, so I'll, I'll answer this in several ways. So one of the,</v>

80
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.480
one of the things that people often tell me, well, you know,

81
00:04:30.481 --> 00:04:34.500
you're protected by tenure professor. So it doesn't take such courage Dr. Side.

82
00:04:34.501 --> 00:04:38.400
Well, in 2017, I had to, well,

83
00:04:38.401 --> 00:04:41.280
whenever I would go to teach courses on campus,

84
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.260
I had to be accompanied by security,

85
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.550
but would then lock the door of my class so that if people left the room,

86
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.660
they'd have to knock to be let back in because of the number of death threats I

87
00:04:51.661 --> 00:04:55.800
was getting, when I would leave campus, what my wife would come to pick me up,

88
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.970
I would literally have something akin to kind of a deflation from an anxiety

89
00:04:59.971 --> 00:05:00.510
attack,

90
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.500
because I didn't know when they were going to come at me are the three guys that

91
00:05:04.501 --> 00:05:07.800
are in the elevator with me. Are they the ones who are going to decapitate me?

92
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.950
So tenure doesn't protect you from that tenure.

93
00:05:10.951 --> 00:05:15.390
Doesn't protect you from all of the opportunities I would have had as an

94
00:05:15.391 --> 00:05:18.360
academic. Other job offers higher salary.

95
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.110
I've been denied now several years in a row, a chaired professorship,

96
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.850
which I had held for 10 years. And it would be a cinch for me to get it renewed.

97
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.650
But because now how outspoken I am and as known as I am now,

98
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.920
a lot of people who would be sitting on the committees to decide whether to give

99
00:05:34.921 --> 00:05:36.330
me the chaired professors or not,

100
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.560
are not very happy with my supposedly big mouth and irreverent attitude.

101
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.690
And therefore I don't get that chaired professorship.

102
00:05:42.691 --> 00:05:44.130
That's your professorship comes with a lot.

103
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.800
<v 1>But do you think it's because there,</v>

104
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.550
do you think it's because they are so infected that they're against the ideas or

105
00:05:50.551 --> 00:05:53.010
that they perhaps subtly agree with you?

106
00:05:53.011 --> 00:05:56.100
I suspect some of the people in your department probably agree with you,

107
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.580
but don't want to, you know, if they're,

108
00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:01.730
if they're the ones that vote on you getting in, well, now they're screwed. So,

109
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:03.790
and that goes to the cowardice thing that we were talking about her.

110
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.290
<v 0>I get that. I get that a lot. You're absolutely right. That the silent majority,</v>

111
00:06:08.291 --> 00:06:12.910
I think even within academia is not on board with this lunacy. But,

112
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.880
but again, the fact that they are a minority,

113
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.010
doesn't suggest that their diabolical destruction is not something to worry

114
00:06:21.011 --> 00:06:23.260
about. Right. I always tell people how, how many,

115
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.190
how many committed zealots that it take to bring down the twin towers?

116
00:06:27.191 --> 00:06:30.430
Was it 190,000 people? No. It took 19 people, right?

117
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.630
So I don't need 9,000 blue haired,

118
00:06:34.631 --> 00:06:38.410
social justice warriors on campus to keep the rest of us be quiet.

119
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.460
I just need a few of them that are a lot more vociferous and committed than the

120
00:06:42.461 --> 00:06:45.040
rest of us. And then they, they will call us into silence.

121
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.300
So I think many professors are exactly what you said. They write to me.

122
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.550
Thank you so much. You're keeping me sane.

123
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.500
I don't know how you have the courage to do this.

124
00:06:53.501 --> 00:06:55.780
I would have left academia where it not because of you.

125
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.530
And then they will often, right. So what do you suggest I do?

126
00:06:59.531 --> 00:07:03.130
Because I'm afraid. And then I always tell them the same thing. It sounds harsh,

127
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.720
but it really is. It cuts to the,

128
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.400
to the truth that the 18 year old guys who landed on Normandy

129
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.820
were not granted safe passage. They knew that 60,

130
00:07:12.821 --> 00:07:15.670
70% of them would be mowed down like little mosquitoes.

131
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.540
And yet they did it so that Dave Rubin and God's side could sit here and speak

132
00:07:19.541 --> 00:07:22.840
freely today. So whatever it is that you are afraid of,

133
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.420
it is a lot less than the guys who landed on Normandy.

134
00:07:25.421 --> 00:07:27.400
So stop being a coward and speak out.

135
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.810
<v 1>It's so interesting because you know, I don't come from the world of academia.</v>

136
00:07:31.811 --> 00:07:34.480
So I think one of the things that has harmed harmed,

137
00:07:34.481 --> 00:07:37.900
some of our friends ability to talk about this stuff is they still want to be

138
00:07:37.901 --> 00:07:41.050
liked in those circles. You come from those circles and you've paid a price.

139
00:07:41.051 --> 00:07:45.670
I don't come from those circles. So that PR that cost is very low for me.

140
00:07:45.671 --> 00:07:50.470
But what I find is I'm very frustrated by the people right now. It's like, look,

141
00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:53.470
Trump is getting critical race theory out of the federal government.

142
00:07:53.471 --> 00:07:56.470
That is incredible, right? That's what everybody, what,

143
00:07:56.471 --> 00:07:59.140
we've all been talking about, identity politics. It's like,

144
00:07:59.141 --> 00:08:01.840
he's getting it out of the federal government and the contractors,

145
00:08:01.841 --> 00:08:06.160
the feds can work with. He got rid of title nine. That meant we're, you know,

146
00:08:06.161 --> 00:08:08.050
in effect, there was no due process anymore.

147
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.880
I thought liberals were for due process,

148
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.760
but it's like they can't give him that credit. So my,

149
00:08:12.761 --> 00:08:16.570
my frustration these days is so aim at,

150
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.900
at what was my side. That it's, it's,

151
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.420
it's not a comfortable spot to be in. Actually,

152
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.020
