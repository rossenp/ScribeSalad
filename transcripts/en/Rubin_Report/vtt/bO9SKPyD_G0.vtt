00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.390
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.250
<v 1>Hello. People who are free, at least for now. It's me,</v>

3
00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:15.380
your host, who is free at least for now.

4
00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:19.550
Dave Rubin today is December 7th, 2020.

5
00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:21.860
This is the Rubin report direct message.

6
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.150
And we're doing all locked down edition of the direct message today.

7
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.850
Everything that I'm doing today is about the lockdown we're putting aside the

8
00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:30.170
election stuff for a little bit.

9
00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:32.600
There's obviously a lot going on there and things working through the courts and

10
00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:33.650
the rest of it. Uh,

11
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.000
but I sense something big is happening on the lockdown front. There,

12
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:39.200
there is a major,

13
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.730
major pushback against what's going on and I felt we should just devote the

14
00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:47.120
whole show to it with a whole bunch of different clips from different cities,

15
00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:51.080
different States, people fighting for their rights. I also spent this weekend,

16
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.240
uh, at some rallies and I just feel like people

17
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.370
have had it and they're pushing back.

18
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.660
And that really is the most American thing that you can do. Let's not forget.

19
00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:07.020
I am live in Los Angeles where as of, I believe this morning or,

20
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.540
or like midnight last night, we are now under full, locked down.

21
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.510
They don't want you walking your dog. They don't want you to roller skating.

22
00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:19.070
They don't want you biking. They don't want you doing pretty much anything.

23
00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:22.430
They want you to sit alone and depressed and pathetic and neutered.

24
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.450
I refuse to do that. I've got a couple people in the room with me right now,

25
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.050
come and get me Garcetti, come and get me. I actually, this weekend,

26
00:01:30.051 --> 00:01:32.770
not only did I go to one of the rallies, we'll,

27
00:01:32.771 --> 00:01:34.160
we'll talk about that in just a second,

28
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.210
but because it was important that you only do vital things.

29
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:40.520
You know what I mean? Really vital things. I, uh,

30
00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:43.490
yesterday morning ordered NBA jam.

31
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.060
Remember NBA jam from the early mid nineties, the, uh,

32
00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:49.640
the amazing arcade game NBA jam. Well,

33
00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:53.930
now you can get a home version of the arcade game. It's only 500 bucks.

34
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.300
I ordered it and picked it up at best buy,

35
00:01:56.301 --> 00:02:01.160
but I felt that that was vital for me because you've got NBA jam on there.

36
00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:04.310
You've got like NBA jam tournament edition, and then one other one.

37
00:02:04.311 --> 00:02:08.120
And I put it together yesterday and you can play Wi-Fi and David and I beat my

38
00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:10.910
brother and my 10 year old nephew.

39
00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:13.430
It's like one of the first times I've been able to beat my nephew in anything.

40
00:02:13.431 --> 00:02:17.900
So I'm very excited and that was what's vital for me to stay alive. Uh,

41
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.561
all right. So you know what,

42
00:02:18.561 --> 00:02:21.110
instead of running down all the stories which I normally do at the top of the

43
00:02:21.111 --> 00:02:23.330
show where we're just going to plow into them,

44
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.900
because they're all just one after the other lockdown related things.

45
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.360
So we showed you a video, Oh, you know what, real quick,

46
00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:31.190
before I get into that fully, uh,

47
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.210
our direct message on Friday was our most watched direct message ever about

48
00:02:35.211 --> 00:02:39.830
800,000 views on YouTube alone. That's not that doesn't include what's going

49
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.990
on@therubinreportcommunityandontheblaze.com. And I just want to say that I'm,

50
00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:49.610
I'm thrilled. So many of new people, so many of you who are new are here,

51
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.860
uh, and obviously what we're talking about and trying to noodle through these

52
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:57.230
issues in an honest way, it matters.

53
00:02:57.231 --> 00:03:00.460
And more of you guys are sharing the videos and commenting on them and all that

54
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:02.650
good stuff. So I appreciate it. I thank you.

55
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.660
And I'll do my best not to let you down. Okay. So, uh,

56
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.910
we showed a video last week.

57
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.560
This was a woman by the name of Angela Marsden. And she, uh,

58
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.030
is the owner of pineapple Hill restaurant and bar, uh,

59
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.990
in Sherman Oaks, California in Los Angeles in effect in the Valley.

60
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.090
And she showed, we showed the video,

61
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:29.440
but she basically did a selfie video of her restaurant and the fact that they

62
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:31.750
had closed her down, not only inside,

63
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.140
but even though she did all of this stuff to make a really nice outdoor area,

64
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:40.000
they closed her down. But then right next to that, they were allowing, um,

65
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.230
a movie or a TV show. I think it was a TV show, actually like a Netflix show,

66
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.910
set up tents for their people to eat. So those people are essential,

67
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.830
but apparently she's not essential. Well,

68
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:53.410
I actually went to the rally that she was at and I interviewed her.

69
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:55.390
We put up a video over the weekend about that,

70
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.040
but let's take a look quick at the, uh,

71
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.240
just like a 22nd bite of the original video. And then we'll go from there.

72
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.780
<v 2>So this is my place, the pineapple Hill grill in saloon. If you go to my page,</v>

73
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.090
you can see all the work I did for outdoor dining,

74
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.220
for tables being seven feet apart.

75
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.350
And I come in today because I'm organizing a protest and I came in to get

76
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.690
stuff for that. And I walk into my parking lot.

77
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.490
And obviously.

78
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.240
<v 1>But sake, we're not going to show you the whole thing right now,</v>

79
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.710
but we showed it all on Friday. And I interviewed her on Saturday.

80
00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:37.320
So what happened was, as I said in the parking lot there, you see,

81
00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:40.290
she sets her bar outside stuff. And then if you watch the end of the video,

82
00:04:40.291 --> 00:04:42.540
they show you that, Oh, if you're a TV production,

83
00:04:42.541 --> 00:04:43.860
you're allowed to sit outside and eat,

84
00:04:43.861 --> 00:04:47.250
but they aren't as if any of this has to do with science as if any of this has

85
00:04:47.251 --> 00:04:51.480
to do with anything constitutional or sensible or anything else.

86
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.360
So Sheila and a bunch of people, because I'm sorry, not Sheila.

87
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.720
Sheila's the woman we'll get to in just a minute, Angela,

88
00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.910
because that video went so viral.

89
00:04:59.911 --> 00:05:02.340
And I'd like to think that I had a little something to do with it. Uh,

90
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.020
they did a big rally on Saturday at the house of Sheila.

91
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.580
Cool. Now Sheila cool.

92
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.840
I had talked about last week because she was one of the five city supervisors

93
00:05:12.841 --> 00:05:17.130
who voted just last week to close everything, right?

94
00:05:17.131 --> 00:05:21.990
That's what allowed, uh, furor Garcetti to close everything. And in effect,

95
00:05:21.991 --> 00:05:26.340
they voted three to two to close all of the restaurants. And then Sheila cool,

96
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.780
this woman who makes over $300,000 a year,

97
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.590
$300,000 a year to just be a government,

98
00:05:34.591 --> 00:05:38.100
nothing to just be a middleman who controls people's lives,

99
00:05:38.101 --> 00:05:41.760
who are actually producing. She voted three to two.

100
00:05:41.761 --> 00:05:44.790
So she was the deciding vote to shut down all the restaurants.

101
00:05:44.791 --> 00:05:46.650
And then as we talked about last week, what did she do?

102
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.260
She went to an outdoor restaurant,

103
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.120
even though she was going to close them all down in a few days,

104
00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:55.410
but it was so severe what's happening with COVID. It's so dangerous.

105
00:05:55.411 --> 00:05:59.870
We've got to crush all of these 1000 restaurants that we have in Los Angeles.

106
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.360
And so Cal, and, but she could just get one last quick Italian meal in there.

107
00:06:04.361 --> 00:06:07.000
So these people are hypocrites and Angela,

108
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.760
and a bunch of you organized a rally at Sheila's house. Now,

109
00:06:09.761 --> 00:06:12.490
I don't like doing these things at people's houses. I actually,

110
00:06:12.491 --> 00:06:13.990
when I got there, I said to Angela, Oh,

111
00:06:13.991 --> 00:06:15.760
I wish we would have done this at your restaurant.

112
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.390
I even offered her a thousand bucks. I was just going to buy people food,

113
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.030
but there was just too many things happening too, to do it at once.

114
00:06:22.031 --> 00:06:23.890
But if she wants to do that, Angela,

115
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.880
I'm guessing you're probably watching now when we're texting. So, uh, uh,

116
00:06:26.881 --> 00:06:29.620
that offer still stands. Um, but in any event,

117
00:06:29.621 --> 00:06:31.000
they did it at Sheila cool's house.

118
00:06:31.001 --> 00:06:34.480
Couple hundred people came bunch of a bunch of press was there.

119
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.450
We've we've got a bunch of photographs that I think were relaying in as I'm

120
00:06:37.451 --> 00:06:39.880
discussing some of this stuff. And, and it was,

121
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.330
it was just incredible because you really need to understand that the people

122
00:06:43.331 --> 00:06:44.560
that are showing up to these things,

123
00:06:44.561 --> 00:06:47.410
I met several other restaurant owners and other business owners.

124
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.340
These are not radicals. Many of them probably two months ago.

125
00:06:51.341 --> 00:06:52.630
Didn't think of themselves as trumps.

126
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.600
Although I think a lot of them are rethinking it right now, right?

127
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.790
I don't think these are particularly political people.

128
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.800
These are just people who want to go out and live. That's all they are.

129
00:07:02.801 --> 00:07:07.690
I met a guy who owns 39 restaurants in LA employs about a thousand people.

130
00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:10.480
He's had to lay off about 800 people. He now said,

131
00:07:10.481 --> 00:07:12.790
he's going to run for County supervisor,

132
00:07:12.791 --> 00:07:16.660
which is a cool Sheila cools job.

133
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.160
So people are getting involved and pushing us. It's like, you're just pushing,

134
00:07:21.161 --> 00:07:24.190
pushing, pushing on good people. I don't know if we showed it already,

135
00:07:24.191 --> 00:07:28.340
but we can also throw up the image of me signing the petition. Yeah, we did, uh,

136
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.450
of me signing the petition to recall Gavin Newsome.

137
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.500
And it's a very complex situation. And if your pen literally touches the line,

138
00:07:35.501 --> 00:07:38.290
it doesn't count. And like a whole bunch of a whole bunch of stuff.

139
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.620
But I signed the petition to get rid of Newsome. Who's just a horrific,

140
00:07:41.621 --> 00:07:45.700
horrific governor and our awful mayor here in New York city. And again, uh,

141
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.880
here in Los Angeles. And again, these are just good people.

142
00:07:48.881 --> 00:07:51.430
These aren't political people. They don't want to hurt anybody.

143
00:07:51.431 --> 00:07:54.460
They want to be able to live and to meet all of these people.

144
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.280
Who've dedicated their lives to something, to build something.

145
00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.800
And then just watch bureaucrats, take it away,

146
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.890
knowing that there's no science behind it. It's, it's, uh,

147
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.340
I feel different actually than I felt over the last couple days.

148
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.040
And I was sort of more annoyed than usual last week. And this week I'm,

149
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.440
I'm feeling some kind of like righteous indignation.

150
00:08:11.441 --> 00:08:14.530
Like we've got to fix this and no one's coming to save us guys.

151
00:08:14.531 --> 00:08:15.940
No one is coming to save us.

152
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.120
If you think some good guys are coming and the Avengers are going to assemble,

153
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.630
they aren't your, the Avengers now. And you got to push back. So Eric,

154
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.560
our city let's throw a couple of quotes in, uh, from, uh, Mr. Mayor. He said,

155
00:08:26.561 --> 00:08:27.880
my heart goes out to Ms.

156
00:08:27.881 --> 00:08:31.630
Marsden and the workers at pineapple Hills saloon who have to comply with the

157
00:08:31.631 --> 00:08:35.350
state and County public health restrictions that close outdoor dining,

158
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.600
meaning no one likes these restrictions,

159
00:08:37.601 --> 00:08:42.490
but I do support them as our hospital ICU beds to capacity in cases of increased

160
00:08:42.491 --> 00:08:46.960
500%, we have to stop this virus before it kills thousands of more Angelenos.

161
00:08:46.961 --> 00:08:51.460
Now we showed you a chart on Friday about ICU, uh,

162
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.370
the amount of beds that are taken in ICU and in the regular hospitals.

163
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.180
And although they are now going up again,

164
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.960
they have never gotten close to being overwhelmed here in Los Angeles.

165
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:01.891
As far as I know,

166
00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:06.030
we haven't had anywhere in the United States where its hospitals have really

167
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:08.520
been overwhelmed. That means we've done something good.

168
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.300
That means people do wear masks. That means, you know,

169
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:17.340
businesses are acting responsibly. And again, guys, and don't forget it.

170
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:20.160
Cause they're going to try to make you memory hole, everything.

171
00:09:20.161 --> 00:09:25.140
1984 in March, we were told two weeks to flatten the curve.

172
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.800
Does this feel like this is about COVID anymore?

173
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.090
Does it feel like it's about something else? And,

174
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.550
and also just think about it this way.

175
00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:34.110
And this is what you need to bring up when your,

176
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.250
when your crazy uncle or whoever is screaming at you about this stuff.

177
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.890
We have some States like Florida in particular,

178
00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:44.190
Texas red States that are opened up. They're much more opened up.

179
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.170
People are doing what's responsible,

180
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:47.760
whatever they feel is right for their lives.

181
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:51.480
And then we have these States and severe lockdown like California. Now,

182
00:09:51.481 --> 00:09:55.940
why are the numbers not wildly out of control? If they are, please show me.

183
00:09:55.941 --> 00:10:00.020
But nobody seems to be able to show me right? If, if this is to be true,

184
00:10:00.021 --> 00:10:02.300
if all of this is to be true, follow the science and all that. Well,

185
00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:04.340
one state's opening up. They're letting people do what they want.

186
00:10:04.341 --> 00:10:06.140
People are eating out. They're talking to each other.

187
00:10:06.141 --> 00:10:10.100
They're singing during holidays. Well, shouldn't those numbers be exploding.

188
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.550
Not, not just a little bit higher or just comparable,

189
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.670
but shouldn't those numbers be exploding while these are going down.

190
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.420
And then if that was the case, wouldn't people from red States, Florida,

191
00:10:20.421 --> 00:10:23.960
and Texas be fleeing. There's a mass outbreak of a disease.

192
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.270
That's killing everybody. We have no hospital beds or any of those.

193
00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.630
Wouldn't they be fleeing to the sanctuary of blue States,

194
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.530
but ha ironically, that's not happening.

195
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.210
Obviously you all know what's happening,

196
00:10:35.211 --> 00:10:39.770
which is that people in blue States are fleeing to go to red States to be

197
00:10:39.771 --> 00:10:43.490
freer and live their lives and save on taxes and everything else.

198
00:10:43.491 --> 00:10:47.630
So someone like, like sometimes they'll tell you to follow them science, which,

199
00:10:47.631 --> 00:10:50.120
which really at this point means almost nothing.

200
00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:54.590
And I watched a video this morning of Andrew Cuomo and Fowchee giggling for like

201
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.310
five minutes about which one of them is DeNiro in which one of them is Peshy or

202
00:10:58.311 --> 00:11:01.490
something, or they're just laughing. Like, they're this fun duo now.

203
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.830
And it's like, you guys are all just gross.

204
00:11:03.831 --> 00:11:05.720
These people are gross and this is about control.

205
00:11:05.721 --> 00:11:10.340
It has almost nothing to do at this point, uh, with COVID. But all right,

206
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:13.220
I've been talking about LA in California, let's get to the other coast.

207
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:17.570
So we also talked about the story last week in Staten Island.

208
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.300
And I should mention that one of the things that I'm really going to try to do

209
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.321
with this show,

210
00:11:21.321 --> 00:11:24.410
and I think we're doing a pretty decent job of it so far is that, you know,

211
00:11:24.411 --> 00:11:26.900
one of the things that happens in news is you get a story and then you never

212
00:11:26.901 --> 00:11:28.310
find out what else happens, right?

213
00:11:28.311 --> 00:11:30.710
They just tell you something that keeps you in the initial outrage.

214
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.650
And that's it. I'm going to try not to do that.

215
00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:37.610
So last week you all heard the story of max public house.

216
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:41.510
This is a bar in Staten Island, which is as New York as you can get. Okay.

217
00:11:41.511 --> 00:11:43.910
It's just perfect quintessential New York.

218
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:47.930
And this guy wanted to keep his pub open. The police sent plain clothes,

219
00:11:47.931 --> 00:11:51.710
police officers there. They shut him down. Uh, he tried to stay open.

220
00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:54.190
They wouldn't, they wouldn't let him open. Uh,

221
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.780
well then in the last couple of days, uh, his lawyer and his, uh,

222
00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:02.380
representative held a press conference right outside and, uh,

223
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.100
listen to some of the stuff that that Mack and his guys are going through right

224
00:12:06.101 --> 00:12:07.330
now. This is video from Fox news.

225
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.630
<v 3>The Blasio, and now Cuomo have told the people of Staten Island,</v>

226
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:16.140
New York city and the country that if you speak up to the emperor,

227
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.490
you get crushed in the last week, just to give you a timeline.

228
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.930
Lou jell amino,

229
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:25.920
one of the finest criminal defense attorneys around and Mark Fante, um,

230
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.920
who represent Dan Mac max pub, uh,

231
00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:33.150
Lou was served with Louis charged with a misdemeanor for trying to be a lawyer.

232
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.170
Our political leaders came here to try to stand up for the guys and the

233
00:12:37.171 --> 00:12:38.670
restaurants and the movement.

234
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:43.890
And Andrew Lanza was nearly handcuffed in front of max pub for trying to stand

235
00:12:43.891 --> 00:12:46.950
with the people. The other night,

236
00:12:46.951 --> 00:12:49.080
we found out that it was a political ambush.

237
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.750
More details will come your way on what's happened,

238
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.740
but it's a tale of two cities. Walmart just announced the pain,

239
00:12:55.741 --> 00:12:58.890
$700 million in bonuses and sat down.

240
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.040
Restaurant owners are getting arrested two times in a week for trying to make a

241
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:06.780
hundred bucks. The ignorance is so high that on national television,

242
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.090
they find it funny that small business owners are trying to feed their families

243
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.850
while the millionaire's sitting in their perch. Okay.

244
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.200
<v 1>So I'll reference that last line in just a sec about national television and</v>

245
00:13:19.201 --> 00:13:19.861
what they're doing,

246
00:13:19.861 --> 00:13:24.510
because SNL just dropped in one of their painfully unset on funny skits about,

247
00:13:24.511 --> 00:13:26.460
about just that, but he said a couple of things.

248
00:13:26.461 --> 00:13:30.150
So that's the representative for Mac and, uh, for the, for the pub there, uh,

249
00:13:30.151 --> 00:13:32.880
that they're going after lawyers. And again,

250
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.940
do you think that this representative or this lawyer or Mac,

251
00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:38.190
do you think that any of these people want it to be fighting the government

252
00:13:38.191 --> 00:13:40.440
right now? What do you think these people want?

253
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.300
I think they just want to go to work.

254
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:45.450
I think they just want to feel that they have a sense of purpose and they can

255
00:13:45.451 --> 00:13:48.540
make some money and they can feed their families. That's it? That's it.

256
00:13:48.541 --> 00:13:53.040
Nobody wants to be in this position, not the lawyers, not the, not the owners,

257
00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.650
not the people who want to go out and live their lives.

258
00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:59.100
And we've got governments that are coming, they're coming for everybody.

259
00:13:59.101 --> 00:14:02.010
And we're just sitting there doing nothing about it. And, and by the way,

260
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:05.670
you know, when this makes it to mainstream news, it's only to market.

261
00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:09.600
So SNL Saturday night live, which was a funny show about 30 years ago,

262
00:14:09.601 --> 00:14:10.830
I think it stopped being funny,

263
00:14:10.831 --> 00:14:14.220
basically that last season that Phil Hartman was there yet that Phil Hartman,

264
00:14:14.221 --> 00:14:17.850
Adam Sandler when Adam Sandler was funny season. And then, and then, uh,

265
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:20.340
Ellen Cleghorne was on back then. And, uh,

266
00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.580
Mike Myers I think was on a couple of other guys. And then it's just been trash.

267
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.860
It's just left his trash now for the last, you know,

268
00:14:25.861 --> 00:14:29.640
probably 25 years or something. But this is this guy, Pete Davidson.

269
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.790
Who's just deeply on funny, but don't take my word for it. Uh,

270
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.750
mocking the people who were trying to live while he has a job where I'm sure

271
00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:39.810
he's making hundreds of thousands of dollars and has fame and everything else.

272
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:41.820
So this is SNL this past Saturday.

273
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.260
<v 4>So the rule is that they're supposed to let people eat or drink outside.</v>

274
00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:49.770
And the owner said, no one wants to do that. Cause they'll go out of business.

275
00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:53.540
But the argument that in Staten Island don't want to drink outside can be

276
00:14:53.541 --> 00:14:56.270
disproven by going to literally any little league game.

277
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.360
One guy at the protests even gave a speech where he literally compared not being

278
00:15:02.361 --> 00:15:06.140
able to drink indoors to being Jewish during the Holocaust,

279
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.880
which must've been awkward for.

280
00:15:07.881 --> 00:15:11.480
The people there who had to suddenly pretend they believed in the Holocaust.

281
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:18.020
So I take it. Or you found these protests frustrating. Yeah, man,

282
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.320
that making us look like babies, you know, you know,

283
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:24.560
it's bad when even people in Boston are like, ah, drink at home, your quiz.

284
00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.390
<v 1>W what did I just watch there? People are paid to write that. I mean, what's,</v>

285
00:15:31.391 --> 00:15:35.950
self-righteous drivel by put on a shirt. You Dick,

286
00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:39.280
like these people are awful. They're dope. See, I cursed, I cursed.

287
00:15:39.281 --> 00:15:40.840
I was trying to remember what I said on Friday.

288
00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:44.560
I was trying to not curse as much. Cause I was cursing a little more last week.

289
00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.860
That was a total accident right there. But these are horrible people.

290
00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:52.840
You are mocking the people who want to make a living while you make I'm sure

291
00:15:52.841 --> 00:15:54.910
that guy makes six figures. There's no doubt about it.

292
00:15:54.911 --> 00:15:58.180
And he's been in movies and he's loved by Hollywood. And what is comedy?

293
00:15:58.181 --> 00:16:00.700
Comedy is supposed to be punching up, right? Comedy is supposed to be,

294
00:16:00.701 --> 00:16:04.420
you fight something above you. You make a joke about it.

295
00:16:04.421 --> 00:16:06.010
What does a gesture in a court do? Right?

296
00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:09.340
You make fun of the King that makes everybody realize they're part of the thing.

297
00:16:09.341 --> 00:16:11.470
These are guys. These are people that are punching down.

298
00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:12.580
They're punching people who are out of work.

299
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.480
And what was the implication that people who want to go to these bars don't

300
00:16:16.481 --> 00:16:18.820
believe in the Holocaust. What the hell are you talking about?

301
00:16:18.821 --> 00:16:21.790
These people are absolutely awful.

302
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.780
And the reason it's worth showing you that not that anyone watches SNL besides

303
00:16:25.781 --> 00:16:30.100
the, the blue check, like Twitter elites, like nobody watches it.

304
00:16:30.101 --> 00:16:33.970
Nobody actually thinks it's funny, but you can feel the whole system,

305
00:16:33.971 --> 00:16:38.140
the whole awful system that we've been fighting against for the last four years,

306
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:42.310
you can feel it like kind of recalibrating right now and starting to come back

307
00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:47.080
where SNL will now make fun of Republicans and regular people again.

308
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:51.160
And we're going to have all of the swamp come back and all of these loser

309
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.120
middle-management bureaucrats who are all being let back in by Biden.

310
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.960
It's like the whole awful thing is trying to come back right now.

311
00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:01.330
I don't know that it will come back. I hope that it doesn't come back.

312
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.850
And I still, I said, we're not going to really talk about the election,

313
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:07.000
but I still think there's a lot of things going on there. We shall see.

314
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:09.130
But just Pete Davidson, if you're watching this,

315
00:17:09.131 --> 00:17:14.080
you're a horrible human being who is making money by making

316
00:17:14.081 --> 00:17:18.430
fun of people who are hurting. That's what you're doing with your life and,

317
00:17:18.431 --> 00:17:22.420
and get, get out of that hoodie and put on a shirt like you guys are just,

318
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.360
they're just pathetic. These people. I don't care about the hoodies.

319
00:17:25.361 --> 00:17:26.194
It's not about the hoodie.

320
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.900
These people are just like pathetic and they're unfunny.

321
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:33.160
And they're paid to write that crap to mock decent people while decent people

322
00:17:33.161 --> 00:17:35.530
want to go to work, who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.

323
00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.110
And if you listen to mainstream, it's almost completely backwards.

324
00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:41.290
I'm going to guess that Pete Davidson probably has more friends that are closer

325
00:17:41.291 --> 00:17:44.620
to Holocaust deniers than anyone at that bar. Bigger out what that means.

326
00:17:44.621 --> 00:17:48.280
I'm not even sure. All right, let's move on. Let's go back to this coast.

327
00:17:48.281 --> 00:17:50.460
I'm just bouncing all over America. Today.

328
00:17:50.461 --> 00:17:51.960
We'll have to do more in the middle of the country.

329
00:17:51.961 --> 00:17:54.360
We'll have one from the Pacific Northwest in just a minute,

330
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:55.800
but I need some stuff in the middle of the country.

331
00:17:55.801 --> 00:17:57.030
Can you guys send me some videos?

332
00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.990
This is sheriff Bianco from Riverside County here in California,

333
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.020
who has decided that he's not going to enforce Newsome's lockdowns.

334
00:18:04.021 --> 00:18:07.860
And this is what a brave public servant sounds like. Sheriff, take it away.

335
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.230
<v 5>The dictatorial attitude toward California residents,</v>

336
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.810
while dining and luxury traveling,

337
00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:19.940
keeping his business open and sending his kids to in-person private schools is

338
00:18:19.941 --> 00:18:22.910
very telling about his attitude toward California residents,

339
00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:27.290
his feelings about the virus. And it is extremely hypocritical.

340
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.700
These closures and stay at home orders are flat out ridiculous.

341
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:37.100
The metrics used for closures are unbelievably faulty and are not representative

342
00:18:37.101 --> 00:18:40.280
of true numbers and are disastrous for Versailles County.

343
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.030
When the medical field is so split about this virus,

344
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:47.090
it might be time to employ a little common sense,

345
00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:52.430
keeping money and support from our hospitals who are struggling with normal

346
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:54.500
seasonal increases in patients,

347
00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:58.160
coupled with COVID-19 patients is irresponsible.

348
00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:04.190
It appears part of the new goal is to shift attention away from his and others'

349
00:19:04.191 --> 00:19:06.890
personal behavior with a do. As I say,

350
00:19:06.891 --> 00:19:11.600
not as I do attitude by turning public opinion against California sheriffs.

351
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.500
He is expecting us to arrest anyone, violating these orders,

352
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:18.920
cite them and take their money, close their businesses,

353
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.490
make them stay in their homes and take away their civil liberties.

354
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.680
Or he will punish all of us.

355
00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:30.290
I believe that all jobs are essential to someone leaders do not

356
00:19:30.291 --> 00:19:33.950
threaten attempt to intimidate or cause fear bullied.

357
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.450
<v 1>Sheriff Bianco. If you're watching this, you are a great man.</v>

358
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.780
You are a great man. And I just want to say that I,

359
00:19:41.781 --> 00:19:46.070
for one and I think most good Americans, we stand with our sheriffs.

360
00:19:46.071 --> 00:19:49.760
We stand with our law enforcement. I think blue lives matter.

361
00:19:49.761 --> 00:19:52.130
I think most of these people, not even most,

362
00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:57.020
I think 99.9% of these people are good people who go into this type

363
00:19:57.021 --> 00:19:59.360
of public service to do good,

364
00:19:59.361 --> 00:20:02.360
as opposed to what happens to the people that go purely into the political side,

365
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:04.760
who just want to control everybody and never produce anything.

366
00:20:04.761 --> 00:20:07.760
If you're going into law enforcement, you know, your life is on the line.

367
00:20:07.761 --> 00:20:10.370
Your butt is on the line every single day.

368
00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.190
And I think these people deserve our support.

369
00:20:13.191 --> 00:20:16.040
What this guy is doing is absolutely right. He says a couple things there.

370
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.560
He says the metrics are unbelievably faulty. Well,

371
00:20:18.561 --> 00:20:21.410
of course we know that's true because it's all random.

372
00:20:21.411 --> 00:20:22.370
And none of it makes sense.

373
00:20:22.371 --> 00:20:26.180
I mean the most basic one that I mentioned last week is that part of our new

374
00:20:26.181 --> 00:20:30.770
lockdown here in California is that museums and

375
00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:35.630
zoos must be at 50% museums, virtually all indoors, zoos, outdoors,

376
00:20:35.631 --> 00:20:40.550
but they just okay. 50%, each one that makes sense, 20% real, um, you know,

377
00:20:40.551 --> 00:20:45.020
retail stores. It's like, they're just making up nonsense.

378
00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:48.220
And we are all just going along with it because know what most people don't want

379
00:20:48.221 --> 00:20:51.250
to be revolutionaries. I don't. And yet here we are,

380
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.370
most people want to go about living their lives, but they're literally,

381
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:59.410
they are stealing our lives like this in a weird way. Oh,

382
00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:02.370
one of the people at the, at the rally on Saturday, he said to me,

383
00:21:02.371 --> 00:21:05.070
one of the business owners said to me, this is a fate, worse than death.

384
00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:09.750
This is a fate worse than death. And I kept thinking about that line, like,

385
00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:13.200
like, think about a debt. Okay, you get shot, you get taken out. Whatever it is,

386
00:21:13.201 --> 00:21:15.720
you get hit by a car like it's over, it's over.

387
00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.940
Maybe you did something good in this world. Maybe it didn't.

388
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.520
Maybe you have regrets. Maybe you live like a perfect human being.

389
00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:22.320
You accomplish everything you want to accomplish.

390
00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:27.330
But this thing where your livelihood is being stolen from you

391
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.890
in this restaurant owners estimation was a fate worse than death that you

392
00:21:31.891 --> 00:21:33.660
believe in something, you give your blood,

393
00:21:33.661 --> 00:21:37.890
sweat and tears to something and someone who should have no power over you is

394
00:21:37.891 --> 00:21:41.040
allowed to just take it away. And I don't think we,

395
00:21:41.041 --> 00:21:43.530
the people are going to stand for it much longer. Right. I just don't.

396
00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:48.240
He also said we need common sense. A little common sense. Yeah.

397
00:21:48.241 --> 00:21:49.410
That would probably be good.

398
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.440
And then what I really loved is that he made the point, uh,

399
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:55.710
sheriff Bianco had made the point that this is about shifting attention.

400
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:59.610
So when Garcetti does this and he's out masculine at a rally, you know,

401
00:21:59.611 --> 00:22:02.550
a couple of months ago, or Newsome's at French laundry,

402
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.250
these people are shifting attention from their failures. By the way,

403
00:22:05.251 --> 00:22:09.690
I just read this morning that Garcetti is going to be on Joe Biden's, uh,

404
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:14.010
incoming team. Like that's going to help with the, with the January 20th event,

405
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:17.460
the inauguration event. So it's like, he'll fly here and do that.

406
00:22:17.461 --> 00:22:20.910
That has nothing to do with being the LA mayor. These, these are,

407
00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.400
they're just genuinely horrible people. You know,

408
00:22:23.401 --> 00:22:25.050
one of the things that I try to do on the show,

409
00:22:25.051 --> 00:22:28.020
and I think I mostly succeed on it, not just on the show,

410
00:22:28.021 --> 00:22:32.940
but in life is that I try to talk about ideas more than people. So one,

411
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.690
you know, I'll talk about what people's thoughts are, what their actions are,

412
00:22:36.691 --> 00:22:38.400
things like that as opposed to going after people.

413
00:22:38.401 --> 00:22:41.310
But I do think it's different at this point with politicians,

414
00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.590
which is why I've directly called out these people.

415
00:22:43.591 --> 00:22:46.650
And I've got my fake newsman glasses. When I do it.

416
00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.040
These people specifically must be called out.

417
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:54.720
They must be called out because they are the ones making the decisions.

418
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.070
I don't go after.

419
00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:59.190
I try not to really go after the pundits that I disagree with or that sort of

420
00:22:59.191 --> 00:23:00.990
thing. I tried to talk more about their ideas.

421
00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:05.940
Obviously I'm not perfect at that. Nobody is. Um, but these are bad people.

422
00:23:05.941 --> 00:23:07.710
So I just want to say, and by the way I said it, there were,

423
00:23:07.711 --> 00:23:11.460
there were a group of great officers who were in Santa Monica when I was at the

424
00:23:11.461 --> 00:23:15.900
rally at Sheila cool's house. And I went up to them and I thanked them. And, uh,

425
00:23:15.901 --> 00:23:18.570
and a few of them knew who I was. And it's like, these are good people.

426
00:23:18.571 --> 00:23:23.370
They don't want to stop anyone from living their lives. And,

427
00:23:23.371 --> 00:23:24.780
and basically it's, it's we,

428
00:23:24.781 --> 00:23:29.760
the people versus the small amount of loud lunatics

429
00:23:29.761 --> 00:23:33.030
who want to control us and, and that's what the battle of the future is.

430
00:23:33.031 --> 00:23:33.720
And not only that,

431
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.600
then you couple that with the reality war that I'm always talking about that

432
00:23:36.601 --> 00:23:39.660
half the people don't see any of this stuff, because they're watching CNN.

433
00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:43.620
So anyone in your family that doesn't watch these types of shows,

434
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.820
they have no idea that any of is going on and you see an end showing the

435
00:23:46.821 --> 00:23:50.150
rallies, like think if you were an honest news organization,

436
00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.200
that woman out there that's newsworthy, that's newsworthy,

437
00:23:54.201 --> 00:23:56.060
but what do you get to see on mainstream?

438
00:23:56.060 --> 00:24:01.040
You get to see Pete Davidson make fun of the people who want to live. And man,

439
00:24:01.041 --> 00:24:04.940
this is, this is seriously dangerous. Uh, let's jump to one other video.

440
00:24:04.941 --> 00:24:07.430
And then I promise if you guys send me some videos,

441
00:24:07.431 --> 00:24:09.110
just tweet them at me at Rubin reporter.

442
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.090
It's it's best if you joined the Rubin port community.

443
00:24:11.091 --> 00:24:12.680
And then I have a much better chance of seeing it.

444
00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:15.320
If you see videos from the middle of the country. Cause I don't like that.

445
00:24:15.321 --> 00:24:19.040
I'm just bouncing a lot between New York and LA here or New York and California.

446
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.990
Uh, but this is from bend Oregon and there was a rally to open up,

447
00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:25.610
uh, Oregon. Right?

448
00:24:25.611 --> 00:24:28.250
And that means that there are some same people still in Oregon,

449
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.430
without question, there are, it's just Portland, that's gone completely bananas.

450
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:36.170
Uh, but here is a woman who purports to be a teacher. She says, she's a teacher.

451
00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:39.470
And she has a few choice words for some of the people that just want to go back

452
00:24:39.471 --> 00:24:41.000
to work and try to live their lives.

453
00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:34.413
<v 6>[Inaudible].</v>

454
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:36.580
<v 1>Uh, it brings me back to third grade.</v>

455
00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:39.850
That does remind me of my third grade teacher. I mean, these,

456
00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:41.410
the only reason I'm playing that video,

457
00:25:41.411 --> 00:25:44.140
I don't care about this woman as a private citizen, forget about her.

458
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.330
But the point is, if she is a teacher,

459
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.680
like these are the hysterical nut bags that are teaching your children on top of

460
00:25:50.681 --> 00:25:53.800
the fact that we have critical race theory being pushed back into the schools

461
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.701
and the rest of it.

462
00:25:54.701 --> 00:25:59.540
Like there are mentally unhinged lunatics who often are,

463
00:25:59.541 --> 00:26:02.530
are being pushed on us by the teacher's unions that are completely out of

464
00:26:02.531 --> 00:26:05.500
control at this point that don't even want to work. And in effect,

465
00:26:05.501 --> 00:26:08.380
most of them are not even the teachers aren't even working on these stupid zoom

466
00:26:08.381 --> 00:26:11.770
things. I mean, I'm hearing this from so many parents, it's ridiculous. Um,

467
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.460
but I I'm really playing that video if it had just been some random woman

468
00:26:15.461 --> 00:26:16.480
screaming, I wouldn't have played it.

469
00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.660
But the idea that this woman is a teacher putting aside the,

470
00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:20.860
she dropped a couple of F-bombs.

471
00:26:20.861 --> 00:26:24.220
So even if I hadn't dropped the F bomb before the F bomb was coming in this

472
00:26:24.221 --> 00:26:28.390
episode, so most likely there goes monetization that's okay. Um, anyway,

473
00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:33.040
it's important to know that we're just watching so much stuff kind of

474
00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:37.330
collapse right now. And I think, I think it is your job more,

475
00:26:37.331 --> 00:26:38.680
more than ever before,

476
00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:43.090
more than any of us could have ever realized if you live in modern times that

477
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:46.710
you've got to be one of the ones with the cool heads, you gotta be cool,

478
00:26:46.711 --> 00:26:48.810
calm and collected right now and,

479
00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.030
and know what you believe and why you believe it.

480
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.640
And if you want to find out some of the things that I believe you could check

481
00:26:53.641 --> 00:26:55.350
out my book, cause I lay out all of this stuff.

482
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:59.460
And I was warning about all of this stuff for a long time. Um,

483
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:01.043
anyway,

484
00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:06.120
this was the special lockdown edition of the Rubin report.

485
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.440
Direct message. Uh,

486
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:12.390
we are not going to be live tomorrow or Wednesday because I am actually

487
00:27:12.391 --> 00:27:16.110
heading to DC to go to the white house. That's right.

488
00:27:16.111 --> 00:27:19.890
I am going to the white house Hanukkah party, which is on Wednesday.

489
00:27:19.891 --> 00:27:23.010
So I'm leaving tomorrow. Uh, I'll be there tomorrow and Wednesday.

490
00:27:23.011 --> 00:27:25.050
So we won't have live shows tomorrow or Wednesday,

491
00:27:25.051 --> 00:27:28.260
but I may do some live streams with the, with the trusty phone.

492
00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.990
And I have reached out to the press team. Uh,

493
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.540
that's in charge of the president of the United States.

494
00:27:33.541 --> 00:27:35.850
And obviously we've been going back and forth for quite some time.

495
00:27:35.851 --> 00:27:37.350
I'm going to see if I can get a few minutes with him.

496
00:27:37.351 --> 00:27:40.470
So maybe I can do a little live stream from the oval office or something.

497
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:41.880
We'll see if we can pull that off.

498
00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:44.310
And then I'll be meeting some interesting people in DC.

499
00:27:44.311 --> 00:27:47.640
So we'll probably have a bunch of content that goes up over the next two days.

500
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:53.400
Um, but we will not have an in studio show tomorrow or Wednesday.

501
00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:58.380
Uh, but we will be back at 11:00 AM, Pacific 2:00 PM Eastern on Thursday.

502
00:27:58.381 --> 00:28:00.450
And then of course on Friday as well. Uh, anyway,

503
00:28:00.451 --> 00:28:03.120
send me some videos if you're seeing more of this stuff. And you know,

504
00:28:03.121 --> 00:28:04.170
one of the things that I did in the,

505
00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:07.920
in the Rubin report community this morning was I posted just like,

506
00:28:07.921 --> 00:28:10.230
what are your thoughts on the world?

507
00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:14.850
Because I think I can get way more, uh, incisive,

508
00:28:14.851 --> 00:28:19.070
interesting pieces, little nuggets of knowledge from,

509
00:28:19.071 --> 00:28:20.340
from regular folks.

510
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:25.170
Then I can buy any of the pundit class and certainly anyone on mainstream media.

511
00:28:25.171 --> 00:28:28.590
And that, that does help me shape which way I should take this show.

512
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:32.010
And I could just really feel this morning that so many people are frustrated

513
00:28:32.011 --> 00:28:36.600
with this lockdown. And again, that is not to diminish COVID,

514
00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:41.370
but at some point you have to figure out which one is doing more damage.

515
00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:45.540
Is it the lockdowns that have trapped us in our house and kept us depressed and

516
00:28:45.541 --> 00:28:49.200
rates of alcoholism and everything else and people that are unemployed and

517
00:28:49.201 --> 00:28:50.190
people who have nothing,

518
00:28:50.191 --> 00:28:55.050
just nothing to do and don't feel any reason to wake up and everything else just

519
00:28:55.051 --> 00:28:58.890
on the whims of politicians or is it the actual disease?

520
00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.310
Think about that for yourself. And then we'd probably start having some answers.

521
00:29:02.311 --> 00:29:06.390
All right, guys, that's it for today. Uh, as I said, DC, tomorrow and Wednesday,

522
00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:09.420
I'll do some videos and Periscopes and a whole bunch of other stuff.

523
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.180
And then I'll be back in here on Thursday. All right. People.

524
00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:13.010
<v 0>How.</v>
