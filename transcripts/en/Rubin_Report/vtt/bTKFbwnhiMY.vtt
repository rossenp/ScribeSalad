00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.840
<v 0>My day job is publishing skeptic magazine and directing the skeptic society,</v>

2
00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:07.710
which is a five Oh one C3 non-profit science education organization.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.480
I got interested in the topics,

4
00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:13.500
which is pretty much any of the super interesting topics related to science and

5
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:17.820
religion and spirituality and cults and free will and determinism and God,

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.833
you know,

7
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.860
pretty much all the great topics I'm interested in really goes back to being in

8
00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:24.720
college. And I was a born again, Christian.

9
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.740
<v 2>I'm, Dave Rubin, and this is the Rubin report reminder, everybody,</v>

10
00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:41.570
you can get all our videos and audio podcasts, absolutely add free and

11
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.880
early@rubinreport.com.

12
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.170
And joining me today is the publisher of skeptic magazine host of the science

13
00:00:48.171 --> 00:00:50.990
salon podcast and author of the new book,

14
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.830
giving the devil his due Michael Shermer. Welcome back to the Rubin report.

15
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.250
<v 0>Good to be back. The tournament of champions continues.</v>

16
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.560
<v 2>We've had a couple of technical difficulties today to make this thing happen.</v>

17
00:01:03.561 --> 00:01:06.860
But here we are. I know that as a man of faith,

18
00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:08.870
you're going to pray that our connection does.

19
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.920
<v 0>Uh, I I'm praying away. I'm not going to try to pray away the gay for you,</v>

20
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:14.420
but I'm gonna try to pray away.

21
00:01:14.421 --> 00:01:19.400
The Corona virus plugs in our computer systems here. It's the 5g you see?

22
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.020
<v 2>Oh, it's definitely, it's definitely the 5g it's coming for everybody.</v>

23
00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:27.660
It's spreading coronavirus, coronavirus and the rest of it. All right. There,

24
00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:30.410
there's a ton I want to get to here because I really love this book.

25
00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:33.740
And I just said to you right before we started that so much in,

26
00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:35.750
in my book as well, we really covered the topics,

27
00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:39.050
but come to slightly different conclusions on a couple of things.

28
00:01:39.051 --> 00:01:42.590
And the way we approach the topics is a little bit different each time.

29
00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:47.210
But before we get to the book itself, you've written 16 books.

30
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.170
And as a guy that just wrote one and knows what it takes to write one,

31
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.950
how do you possibly not only come up with enough material,

32
00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:58.670
but enough sort of personal fortitude and patience and,

33
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.740
and all of it to just be able to sit there and put all of those thoughts out

34
00:02:03.741 --> 00:02:06.500
16 times and quite successfully, by the way,

35
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:08.090
it's not like nobody's reading these things.

36
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.050
<v 0>Yeah. Well, thank you. I appreciate that. Well, first of all, I'm 65.</v>

37
00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:17.030
So I've got a couple of decades on your almost, uh, just cumulative time.

38
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:19.910
But I also started riding in my twenties when I was in college.

39
00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:21.680
I actually always wanted to be a writer.

40
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.260
And then by the time I got to my early thirties,

41
00:02:24.261 --> 00:02:26.990
I had written quite a bit that wasn't published, just, you know,

42
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:29.180
just practicing stuff and trying to get things published,

43
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.650
such that by my first book, uh, let's see, in 1997.

44
00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:38.510
So I was 30. Let's see, 33 now. Let's see. No, it was 43.

45
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.190
Um, you know, I had had quite a bit of material, so, and.

46
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.470
<v 2>Three of my first book, C.</v>

47
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.180
<v 0>C that's right. Uh, so,</v>

48
00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.310
so each book kind of ends with a question of sorts or in my mind anyway,

49
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.510
that's the next book. And it's also a strategy when you're cutting.

50
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.770
Cause I always, I usually write too much material then I think, Oh,

51
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:01.210
I really don't want to give this up.

52
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.420
And I could talk myself into doing that by saying, I'll put it in the next book.

53
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.020
And then it shortens that book. So you don't feel like you've wasted your time,

54
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.450
but person by temperament, I feel like if I don't write pretty much every day,

55
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:16.570
it's like, if I don't go work out, if I don't ride my bike, I feel anxious.

56
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.630
Like I really need to write, I just have kind of a need for it.

57
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.590
And I know other people like Isaac Asimov is like that way.

58
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:27.220
Apparently Stephen King is like that. They just got to crank out the material.

59
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.830
Cause it feels good. It's just sort of what I do. You know,

60
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:34.630
like an artist paints, I write whatever. Um, and so I, I find a lot of,

61
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.020
you know, it's not a chore. I don't have, you know, writer's block per se.

62
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.930
I have time block. I just have, you know,

63
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:43.090
I just need more time because I enjoy it.

64
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.140
<v 2>W one of the things that I really like that you do,</v>

65
00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:47.910
and it's not just in this book, it's,

66
00:03:47.911 --> 00:03:51.270
it's in really all of your books or at least the last few since I've known you

67
00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:55.680
is you give credit to a lot of the other current thinkers that are talking about

68
00:03:55.681 --> 00:03:56.820
these things. And I think that's a,

69
00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.240
that's actually a kind of unique trait because a lot of people want to sort of

70
00:04:00.241 --> 00:04:03.300
sit there and make it seem like they came up with all of this.

71
00:04:03.301 --> 00:04:04.440
But even I was looking at the,

72
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.550
I was looking at the blurbs in the back of the book and, and actually I, it's a,

73
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.520
it's a Rubin report reunion over here. Cause you've got Steven Pinker,

74
00:04:11.521 --> 00:04:16.380
Jordan Peterson, Dean Strawson, Nick Christakis, Amy Tewa and Jonathan Haidt.

75
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.420
And these people that you reference, they've all been on the show, which,

76
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.780
which is nice. But, but that is one of the things that I like about this book,

77
00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:28.740
because you reference a lot of these people and their ideas as sort of the

78
00:04:28.741 --> 00:04:33.000
starting point for starting point or maybe mid point for how you think about

79
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:33.834
things.

80
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.530
Were you always that way that you would sort of hear somebody and kind of mirror

81
00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:38.910
what you think against them?

82
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.030
<v 0>Yeah. To a certain extent. Um, uh,</v>

83
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.330
but as a writer and as a consumer of many other books,

84
00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:48.510
I can see some authors are more generous about crediting,

85
00:04:48.511 --> 00:04:51.870
where their ideas came from and, and sort of tracking for the reader,

86
00:04:51.871 --> 00:04:55.890
how they came up with their thesis of the book or whatever, others, not so much,

87
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.380
I'm not going to name any names, but some people do write in a way,

88
00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:02.100
like they just came out of this whole cloth. It just popped into my brain,

89
00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:06.210
like the muses, you know, and that no ideas happen like that.

90
00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:08.940
We all build on each other. Everybody does. And you know,

91
00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:12.990
in scholarly papers you have to cite just tons and tons and tons of references.

92
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.981
Uh, you know,

93
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:17.700
and that's why sometimes the reference says sections are as long as the papers

94
00:05:17.701 --> 00:05:20.880
themselves. So, um, you know, so I always felt like, well,

95
00:05:20.881 --> 00:05:23.760
I want to be generous. And, and just sort of honest and say,

96
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.450
here's where I came up with these ideas because of these three authors or these

97
00:05:27.451 --> 00:05:29.580
16 sources or whatever. Anyway.

98
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.300
So I just got in the habit of doing that just from training, uh, as a,

99
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.390
as experimental psychologist initially, and then a historian of science,

100
00:05:36.391 --> 00:05:39.990
you just have to do that. But just personally, I feel, you know,

101
00:05:39.991 --> 00:05:43.740
when I see that someone like Richard Dawkins is very generous about that.

102
00:05:43.741 --> 00:05:45.870
He's his, his Steve Pinker, you know,

103
00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:49.260
deciding where all these ideas come from quoting other people. And it's like,

104
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.720
I like that. I'm gonna, I wanna make sure I do that too.

105
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.280
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

106
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.000
So one other thing before we dive specifically into the topics in the book,

107
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.410
because you have now been on the Rubin report at least six times,

108
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:03.890
which places you at number one, which I'm sure despite your,

109
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.630
despite your rather lofty resume,

110
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:08.410
I'm sure that's clearly at the top of the list. Uh, but for,

111
00:06:08.411 --> 00:06:11.150
for somebody that's watching this right now that just doesn't know anything

112
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:15.050
about you, can you just give me a two or three minute sort of recap on,

113
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.900
on how you kind of became the skeptic skeptic?

114
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.030
<v 0>Yeah, well, you know, my day job is publishing skeptic magazine and,</v>

115
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.560
and directing the skeptic society,

116
00:06:23.561 --> 00:06:27.430
which is a five Oh one C3 non-profit science education organization.

117
00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.170
I got interested in the topics,

118
00:06:29.171 --> 00:06:33.220
which is pretty much any of the super interesting topics related to science and

119
00:06:33.221 --> 00:06:37.540
religion and spirituality and cults and free will and determinism and God,

120
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.533
you know,

121
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.580
pretty much all the great topics I'm interested in really goes back to being in

122
00:06:42.581 --> 00:06:45.160
college. And I was a born again, Christian. I was, uh,

123
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.820
in 1971 when I was in 11th grade, uh,

124
00:06:48.821 --> 00:06:51.670
I had two close friends who were interested in converting me.

125
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.930
I didn't even know what that meant really. And, uh, uh, uh, George had Frank,

126
00:06:55.931 --> 00:06:59.530
so George had a really cute sister and invited me to church. So I thought, well,

127
00:06:59.531 --> 00:07:03.600
okay, here's my chance. But then when I got to the church, it was,

128
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.270
it was Presbyterian church in Glendale, California,

129
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.660
and that the minister was unbelievably, uh,

130
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.290
dynamic and just really motivating. And, and at the end he said,

131
00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:17.500
come on up and you can accept these as the whole thing will happen right here.

132
00:07:17.501 --> 00:07:20.200
And I'm like, all right, I'm going. So I went home,

133
00:07:20.201 --> 00:07:22.810
I didn't even know I was doing really, but I did it. And then, you know,

134
00:07:22.811 --> 00:07:26.020
took it pretty seriously. And then I went to Pepperdine university, um,

135
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.560
which is a church of Christ school and very conservative. And, you know,

136
00:07:29.561 --> 00:07:33.460
Gerald Ford came to speak and Edward teller came and gave his mutual assured

137
00:07:33.461 --> 00:07:37.270
destruction, speech, and everyone was dying, Rand, Atlas, shrugged,

138
00:07:37.271 --> 00:07:40.210
and all that, you know, pretty much what you'd expect.

139
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.550
But then when I went to graduate school,

140
00:07:42.551 --> 00:07:47.530
I kind of drifted away from being religious, mainly for two reasons,

141
00:07:47.531 --> 00:07:52.270
one, you know, studying social psychology, anthropology, sociology, you know,

142
00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:56.440
I could see that other people's religious belief systems are very much context

143
00:07:56.441 --> 00:08:00.190
dependent, geographically dependent. Right. So had I been born in India,

144
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:03.490
I very likely would not be Christian. Had I been born, you know,

145
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:08.040
10,000 years ago that there would be no Christians. Right. So, uh, you know,

146
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.260
it seemed to me that that, that doesn't make it wrong,

147
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:12.640
but it makes it more likely to,

148
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:17.200
to be mythically true as our friend Joel Peterson would say,

149
00:08:17.201 --> 00:08:22.090
not empirically true. We're going to get into that. Yeah. So,

150
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.690
um, but, but then also the problem of evil that the Odyssey, what, you know,

151
00:08:25.691 --> 00:08:29.140
why good bad things happen to good people. And, and I'm not talking about,

152
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.860
you know, like a human volition of homicide or war or something like that,

153
00:08:32.861 --> 00:08:36.160
but just like innocent children, dying of leukemia, or, you know,

154
00:08:36.161 --> 00:08:40.090
thousands of children dying from starvation every year and so on. It's like,

155
00:08:40.091 --> 00:08:41.800
why would a good God allow that to happen?

156
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.700
I note there's tons of books and papers by theists and theologians about this.

157
00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.210
But to me, they've never squared that circle. They've never solved that problem.

158
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.920
Other than like rabbi Kushner's famous book when bad things happen to good

159
00:08:53.921 --> 00:08:57.030
people, he, his conclusion was, God simply can't do anything about it.

160
00:08:57.031 --> 00:09:00.840
He's just not, um, he's not omniscient. I mean, he's not Omni omnipotent.

161
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.050
He may know everything, but he can't stop evil. Okay. So that's,

162
00:09:04.051 --> 00:09:08.490
that's one solution. Another one is, well, they're just as bad. And, uh,

163
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:10.650
and that's the simpler solution too.

164
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.400
And that explains a lot because if you understand the laws of physics and say

165
00:09:14.401 --> 00:09:18.120
the second law of thermodynamics, entropy, just happens, you know, just,

166
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:20.520
it's mostly just random. And the, you know,

167
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:24.270
there's very little directionality to why things happen other than just

168
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.980
statistical probabilities. And that's it, there's nothing to explain. Um,

169
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:33.330
you know, like the Corona virus, what's the cause, you know, 500 years ago,

170
00:09:33.331 --> 00:09:34.260
it would have been, you know, well,

171
00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:37.200
women have been cavorting with demons in the middle of the night or the Jews

172
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.970
poisoned the well, or, you know,

173
00:09:38.971 --> 00:09:43.320
some of these kind of crazy supernatural paranormal and erases bigoted

174
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.680
targeting of peoples to explain, well, we don't do that anymore,

175
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.920
except for the 5g craziness. Uh, because you know,

176
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:53.730
we live in an age of science and, and hopefully we've moved past that. So to me,

177
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:59.380
um, once I left the church and really religion, um, I,

178
00:09:59.381 --> 00:10:01.590
I was still interested in answering the big questions like,

179
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.840
well then where did the universe came from? If there was no, God,

180
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.140
what's the origins of morality. What about consciousness?

181
00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:09.690
And why is the universe tuned the way it is,

182
00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:12.630
where do all this diversity of life come from? And, uh, you know,

183
00:10:12.631 --> 00:10:15.510
all the great questions from a secular perspective.

184
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.930
So in trying to answer it myself, I thought, well, I want to write,

185
00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.930
this is what I'm going to write about from a skeptical perspective.

186
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:25.110
So my little niche, my lane, as they say is, you know,

187
00:10:25.111 --> 00:10:28.920
kind of on the margins of science, the pseudoscience and the paranormal,

188
00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:29.760
the supernatural,

189
00:10:29.761 --> 00:10:33.990
the sort of controversial stuff that most mainstream scientists don't deal with.

190
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.690
That's my lane. And from there,

191
00:10:36.691 --> 00:10:40.290
I can tackle the great questions just for my particular perspective.

192
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.420
<v 2>And for more honest and thoughtful conversations about academia instead of</v>
