1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.750
<v 0>I'm telling you, I saw that cat do stuff for soldiers.</v>

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.030
Kids who'd been abused Haitians after storms.

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.550
Yeah. Sometimes the, uh, the, uh, in the ma the way that doesn't matter,

4
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.140
the topical stuff, I sometimes find him equally ill at ease as I am,

5
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.450
but walking the walk and that cat gave a lot of money to a lot of

6
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:25.284
people.

7
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.390
<v 2>Hits with you, because I want to, I want to do sort of where you're at now,</v>

8
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.680
but so when you then start doing O'Reilly and then suddenly people are going,

9
00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:45.620
wait a minute, this is the SNL weekend update guy.

10
00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:48.710
He's like this sort of like hip cool lib kinda.

11
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.420
<v 0>For cool, or is not hip and cool. I was the same.</v>

12
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.980
<v 2>But, but the optics of it now suddenly, wait a minute, this doesn't make sense.</v>

13
00:00:57.981 --> 00:01:01.070
He was on SNL and now he's on evil Fox news. I'm just saying, you know,

14
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.060
this is not my opinion. This is just sort of like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.730
But did you fear that at all? Or, or even none of it.

16
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.190
<v 0>Listen, man, that was on the number one rated show on cable.</v>

17
00:01:13.191 --> 00:01:17.240
I think bill for 20 years, um, I was doing six minutes a week.

18
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.230
It was a beautiful gig. We'd go out on the road once a week or once a month.

19
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.760
We'd sell 10,000 seat crazy. Can you believe that? Could he believe it?

20
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.220
We definitely are a one plus one equals three thing because on my own,

21
00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:34.850
I'd probably at that point draw too. I don't know what Billy was drawn,

22
00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:38.120
but probably two, but you put us together in the mutton. Jeff of it.

23
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.940
It always reminded me of that scene in the Chaplin movie,

24
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.520
not saying we were a chaplain asked for Charlie,

25
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.870
puts his foot behind his leg and kicks the guy who is a work in the border guard

26
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.090
or the guy at LSI and kicks him in the butt. I was doing that to around.

27
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.630
And the key moment in that relationship was when, uh,

28
00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.650
I told bill you're like a big mic beat cop, Irish meat beat cop,

29
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.530
where you're spinning that stick. Everybody's scared shitless. See you.

30
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.290
And I'm going to call you get Billy instead of bill.

31
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.910
And that Y was a great move because all of a sudden the, uh,

32
00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:15.620
the power, the, the monolith as being poked fun at, by the,

33
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.010
the mutton Jeff Guy. And, uh, it was, it was cool.

34
00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:22.280
That's why it worked together is because I could make him laugh,

35
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.200
not an unguarded laugh periodically, and I could poke fun at him.

36
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.710
I could call him Billy. I could wear shorts on his show, which, you know,

37
00:02:30.711 --> 00:02:34.940
I put my leg up and he's like, do you know, not have all that work. And now.

38
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.650
<v 2>A lot of those hits from home.</v>

39
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.620
Did you have a home situation or were you going into a Fox affiliate or

40
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:40.130
something?

41
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.810
<v 0>I went over to this place called the Rubin studios. I, uh, I, uh,</v>

42
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.880
I think we did it up at Santa Barbara and another studio.

43
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.230
We're always on a split screen.

44
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.450
It was so funny until we started going on the road.

45
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:53.090
People would say you and bill, like, we're hoping Crosby is I, you know,

46
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:57.230
I've met her twice. We're always on a split screen, but over the years,

47
00:02:57.231 --> 00:03:01.120
I'll tell you what, I'm a relatively ilities, uh,

48
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.340
uh, socially. I don't know what that is. I don't wanna make it precious bill.

49
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.050
I think if you could watch them over the years.

50
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.000
<v 2>Cause off-camera, you seem exactly the same to me where no,</v>

51
00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:13.920
but there's plenty of comics. I know exactly what you're talking about.

52
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.740
There's a lot of comics that are weird, have eye contact stuff.

53
00:03:16.741 --> 00:03:18.870
Don't want to touch anybody. And then the second, you know,

54
00:03:18.871 --> 00:03:20.530
the camera goes on and bam, they're they're there,

55
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.880
but I don't from the little bit, we just did our thing. I didn't catch it.

56
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.581
<v 0>Well, I,</v>

57
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:27.900
I do know that I don't go to a lot of social events and stuff like that.

58
00:03:27.901 --> 00:03:31.050
When I'm working, I have, I meet a hail fellow, well met.

59
00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:33.840
I like to say hi and be normal. I'm going to cat's place,

60
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.470
but I'm not a real social guy. And he isn't either.

61
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.080
So when you put the two of us together, uh,

62
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.630
I was enamored of that part over a rally.

63
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.800
And I sometimes didn't understand his brusque manner. And I sometimes thought,

64
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.250
why is he beating his drum to that degree when I'd watch him on the show and

65
00:03:50.251 --> 00:03:54.000
bill, if you're seeing this, I I'm not, you know, uh,

66
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.590
I I'm telling you, I saw that cat do stuff for soldiers.

67
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.870
Kids who'd been abused Haitians after storms.

68
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.420
Yeah. Sometimes the, uh, the, uh, in the ma the way that doesn't matter,

69
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.980
the topical stuff, I sometimes find him equally ill at ease as I am,

70
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.320
but walking the walk and that cat gave a lot of money to a lot of

71
00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:23.100
people. And I don't know his personal life. You know, people say whatever I go,

72
00:04:23.101 --> 00:04:26.790
do you really think, Oh, okay. So that's, that's my relationship with O'Reilly.

73
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.850
I'm going to call him and talk about dating or whatever the hell is going on.

74
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.260
It's not my life with him.

75
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.130
We went out on the road and I saw him do a lot of good things for a lot of

76
00:04:35.131 --> 00:04:36.780
people. And guess what?

77
00:04:36.781 --> 00:04:41.340
I felt no need to know to probe the underbelly of bill a rally or find out what

78
00:04:41.341 --> 00:04:44.940
really makes him tick. And he felt no need to find out that being said,

79
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.810
I did seem to do enough things over the years that I find him an honorable man.

80
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.540
Yeah.

81
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.290
<v 2>What do you think about the way that we take out people these days?</v>

82
00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:54.750
You don't have to make it about him specifically, but just generally, you know,

83
00:04:54.751 --> 00:04:57.990
now Chris Matthews went out and it's just like this endless cascade of we're

84
00:04:57.991 --> 00:04:59.030
just going to build people up.

85
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.160
<v 0>Crush. It gets worse. You know,</v>

86
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.270
imagine like Twitter during Dickensian, England. I don't know if

87
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.200
you listen, the rules are clear.

88
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.750
<v 3>It's not worse than it's ever been. That's what everyone says every day.</v>

89
00:05:12.751 --> 00:05:14.040
It's worse than it's ever been.

90
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.440
<v 0>I think the way that it'll turn this. Yeah, it might be.</v>

91
00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:17.820
But I think the way it'll turn,

92
00:05:17.821 --> 00:05:21.570
this is everybody who's in the public eye should get up to a joke.

93
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.060
A witticism a pithy revelation and stop it down themselves

94
00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:30.510
and look at the camera and say, I have something here,

95
00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:34.680
but I'm going to stay up because I understand the new rules and have that happen

96
00:05:34.681 --> 00:05:36.330
ad nauseum for a few years.

97
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.710
And I relate to people how crazy and our post store welling.

98
00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:45.300
And it's gotten as far as jokes, dialogue, throwaways, cruelty,

99
00:05:45.301 --> 00:05:48.630
indeed. Humans are cruel once in a while. Uh, you know,

100
00:05:48.631 --> 00:05:50.760
the fact that that's all neutered down now,

101
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.660
I think people should be reminded that we're missing some of the texture of life

102
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.400
walking around, like we're in Logan's or something, you know, it's, uh,

103
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.600
I don't think it will change for a while because to me it's a,

104
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:03.620
the Lord of the flies.

105
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:07.110
And right now the uptight people have the conch and they're the ones that are

106
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.750
going to speak. And therefore,

107
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:12.200
if I'm sitting there and I get to a point in a joke where I go, this,

108
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:15.770
this puts me, uh, where I have to talk to people who I disagree with,

109
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:20.420
about how bad I am. I just, I stopped off at a jail. No,

110
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:23.390
I'm not going to say it. I've tackled myself here.

111
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.330
And if enough of that happens, people are going to start saying, Hey,

112
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:27.290
I'm sick of this.

113
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.250
<v 2>Have a bunch that you just wouldn't tell anymore. Like,</v>

114
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.570
like an old favorite that you're just.

115
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.560
<v 0>Yeah. And it's, it's easy. Listen, when I used to be on network television,</v>

116
00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:39.670
they told you not to swear. I find that easy. Not to swear when I'm in Vegas.

117
00:06:39.671 --> 00:06:43.150
I find that easy to say, when I'm here. I don't know what the rules are here.

118
00:06:43.151 --> 00:06:44.950
You'll bleep them. No, we don't believe it. Yeah.

119
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.300
I don't even want you to cancel it right now. Think about it.

120
00:06:49.301 --> 00:06:54.070
But I am saying that, uh, yes.

121
00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.700
Uh, and not so much at this point, it all my career will be taken.

122
00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:58.780
I don't care about that.

123
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.250
I care about having to spend time reacting to Nimrods,

124
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.390
who quite frankly think second guessing is creativity. It isn't.

125
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.610
I like being with creative people.

126
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.500
I like being with people who say things occasionally I'll believe you said that.

127
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:18.220
And, uh, I don't think it's over then.

128
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:23.290
And I listen to the human. The human fray is kickoff. It is.

129
00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:27.100
It's like, well, where was it written that you never gave me here?

130
00:07:27.101 --> 00:07:29.650
Anything that falls on your, you know,

131
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.460
feel you in your ear and you'll disagree with, I wouldn't want,

132
00:07:33.461 --> 00:07:35.170
I don't want to lead that life.

133
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.710
So therefore I'll stop myself just because I think Christ I,

134
00:07:38.711 --> 00:07:42.760
who needs the bring down of some white kid telling me how I've ruined his day.

135
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.670
<v 2>Yeah. You know, I used to do, if there's some old,</v>

136
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.080
my old stand-up tapes are right there.

137
00:07:47.081 --> 00:07:50.200
And I used to do a joke way back when that I used to say the N word and it was

138
00:07:50.201 --> 00:07:53.230
not to be racist in any way. It was actually a stupid,

139
00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:56.920
silly transformers reference that I was imitating a transformer.

140
00:07:56.921 --> 00:07:59.710
And I would say it would always get a huge laugh, huge laugh.

141
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:00.970
I would close with it sometimes.

142
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.690
And then one night I was on stage at Gotham comedy club on 24th.

143
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.910
And the audience kind of turned on me.

144
00:08:06.911 --> 00:08:10.210
This is like maybe 2004 or something like that.

145
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.360
And I remember thinking I'm putting that one away and I never did it again.

146
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.820
I never, I never liked that feeling, but I was just like.

147
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:16.511
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

148
00:08:16.511 --> 00:08:19.870
this is where you want to do a Nantucket sleigh ride with a bit where they ride

149
00:08:19.871 --> 00:08:22.960
it to the bottom. Yeah. It doesn't interest me. I'm out there.

150
00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:26.230
The police people, I like to get labs. And at some point,

151
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.610
if I have an opinion and I feel it's worth it, uh, I'll push it in.

152
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.020
Even if it draws Iyer.

153
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.380
But there are other times I think this isn't good enough to let this all this,

154
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:39.040
uh, agitate into my life. That's nerve and drags tires. So yeah. You know,

155
00:08:39.041 --> 00:08:42.460
it's so precious to me that we sit down every day and 10 times a day,

156
00:08:42.461 --> 00:08:46.790
somebody has to get themselves back and supine.

157
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.160
And I remember when, uh,

158
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.900
years ago there was a cat who is the general manager for the Los Angeles Dodgers

159
00:08:52.901 --> 00:08:56.730
outcome panelists. Do you remember him? I'm Ted. Uh, I was here,

160
00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:01.050
but here he goes on Ted Koppel one night and he says something that's like from

161
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:05.200
another generation racially and he's dead. You dead.

162
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.990
He's he's got to go supplicate for Sharpton, you know, all,

163
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:14.550
all that silly game. And, uh, cause,

164
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.300
cause sharpen so righteous. Yeah. Yeah. And I remember thinking, you know,

165
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:22.170
when Jackie Robinson first came up and he goes to Montreal and the Dodgers he's

166
00:09:22.171 --> 00:09:25.440
playing minor league baseball and they got to assign somebody to go out with a

167
00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:30.360
cat and you know, uh, right wing, man, I think Campanis is right there.

168
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:32.790
I mean, when it came to real life,

169
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:36.870
he was there and then later he says something brutish from a dead day,

170
00:09:36.871 --> 00:09:40.380
gone by and he's over. And I remember thinking, Oh,

171
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:45.030
this is so tedious. You know, that's the smartest thing Eric Holder ever said.

172
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:46.890
Although I think he backed back, ended into,

173
00:09:46.891 --> 00:09:50.280
I don't even think he meant it the way I took it. When he said we're cowards,

174
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:54.930
we don't even have chats about things anymore. Uh, racial relations, indeed.

175
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:58.560
We don't. And guess what you're going to, you want to be the first guy in

176
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:01.800
early. You want to be over this afternoon,

177
00:10:01.801 --> 00:10:06.660
trying to make some sort of lucid nuanced comment about interactions

178
00:10:06.661 --> 00:10:08.550
between human beings of different colors.

179
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.490
You don't want to be the first guy and you're done.
