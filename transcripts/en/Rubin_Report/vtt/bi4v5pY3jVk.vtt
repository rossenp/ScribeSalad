1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.550
<v 0>I do find it distressing though, that the gay community and I,</v>

2
00:00:04.551 --> 00:00:07.830
and I have gay friends who hate me even using that term now the gay community,

3
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:11.790
they really resent it, but there is a gay community. I live in West Hollywood.

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.520
I see it on the Boulevard all the time,

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.430
but I think the problem is that that is happening everywhere.

6
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.900
And I do think that I would love it if the gay community listened more to

7
00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:22.770
someone like Morrissey,

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.600
who was constantly criticized by the gay community for just being open and

9
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:31.710
honest and saying what he feels, I don't think he's attacking anybody.

10
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.431
He's just,

11
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:36.210
he's not really on the right side of the political curve for most gay people.

12
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.530
And he's automatically attack now. That is really true for a lot of people.

13
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.210
I wish that was pulled back.

14
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.080
<v 2>Your sort of view on all this is shaped by being a bad gay,</v>

15
00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.560
that gays are sort of outsiders off the bat.

16
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.190
And that does frame how you kind of look at the world a little bit.

17
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.880
<v 0>Yeah, well look, it's what I think made me want to be a writer in many ways. Uh,</v>

18
00:01:09.881 --> 00:01:11.810
I think being gay as a kid,

19
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.150
then I'm not so sure now I think it's probably a lot easier and you're

20
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.280
a lot more, what's the word, uh,

21
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.080
acclimated into culture in a way at a much earlier age than we ever were.

22
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.120
Um, I'm a, I'm a bit older than you, but, uh,

23
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.450
growing up in the seventies and into the eighties, you were kind of.

24
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.540
<v 2>Yeah. Of secret nineties, it was the same thing.</v>

25
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.500
<v 0>You were not out and you had to kind of navigate, uh,</v>

26
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.150
these paths on your own.

27
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.350
One of the things that I think is really interesting about being gay is that you

28
00:01:42.351 --> 00:01:46.220
have to, I think you look at the world in a much more realistic,

29
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.180
hard way than your straight counterpoints too.

30
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.430
I think that you see the world for what it's really like.

31
00:01:52.431 --> 00:01:57.110
You're not really involved in the poses and in the game and ship that goes

32
00:01:57.111 --> 00:02:01.280
on, uh, within, you know, societal structures.

33
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.100
And you also have to, you know,

34
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.840
redefine most everything that you experienced, culturally, whether it's movies,

35
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:11.510
whether it's pop songs, whether it's things you watch on TV,

36
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:13.910
whether it's books you read. So you really begin to,

37
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.000
you begin to see the world in a way that none of your other friends do,

38
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:20.270
you are an outsider. You are an outsider because of that.

39
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.750
But I also have to say that I did not let it define me.

40
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.310
And it was not something that ever got me down. I never got depressed by it.

41
00:02:28.311 --> 00:02:32.450
It was something that I realized was just another thing I had to deal with among

42
00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:35.030
many other things I had to deal with. It was not.

43
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.600
And I think this is probably where I was not that concerned with it.

44
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.940
And it became something that, um, was, uh, you know,

45
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.060
I resented the fact that I couldn't express myself in a certain way.

46
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.260
And I think that frustration certainly played a part in wanting to become a

47
00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:54.860
writer. So I have to say, uh, you know,

48
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.920
um, thank you in a way. I mean, it kind of worked me definitely.

49
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.520
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

50
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.300
But when you see what sort of has happened to the gay community where it used to

51
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:08.650
maybe in the seventies and eighties and before that there was a subversive

52
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:09.400
nature to it,

53
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.450
a lot of good art and music and underground scenes or writing and writing and

54
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:16.600
all sorts of things came from it. Where now it seems like it's,

55
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:20.500
so the reverse it's the most sort of woke you sort of

56
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.880
cemented Glenn bland way of thinking. Well,

57
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.610
in terms of mainstream, whatever the hell that is.

58
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.310
<v 0>That's true of everything.</v>

59
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.320
And it's just that what happened last 10 years is that

60
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.450
gay life, whatever that means.

61
00:03:36.451 --> 00:03:40.020
And I do believe that there is a certain aspect.

62
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.980
If you're a gay person that you do have a bit of a gay life,

63
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.460
it doesn't mean that it overwhelms you and everything becomes gay.

64
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.840
It means that, yeah, sure.

65
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.490
You have the same preoccupations and some of the same concerns as fellow gay

66
00:03:53.491 --> 00:03:56.970
people. You obviously have to, in terms of 20 years ago, politics,

67
00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.470
or even further back than that,

68
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.560
how the United States was dealing with the AIDS crisis, for example. So you,

69
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:06.390
you are, you are pushed together to a degree. Um,

70
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.850
but I think that that's happening all over the place.

71
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.560
I do find it distressing though, that the gay community and I,

72
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.830
and I have gay friends who hate me even using that term now the gay community,

73
00:04:16.831 --> 00:04:20.790
they really resent it, but there is a gay community. I live in West Hollywood.

74
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.520
I see it on the Boulevard all the time.

75
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.430
But I think the problem is that that is happening everywhere.

76
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.560
And I do think that, uh,

77
00:04:28.561 --> 00:04:32.220
I would love it if the gay community listed more to someone like Morrissey who

78
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.200
was constantly criticized by the gay community for just being open and honest

79
00:04:37.201 --> 00:04:41.430
and saying what he feels, I don't think he's attacking anybody. He's just,

80
00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:45.210
he's not really on the right side of the political curve for most gay people.

81
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.530
And he's automatically attack now. That is really true for a lot of people.

82
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.180
I wish that was pulled back.

83
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.750
And I wish that the conversation was once we're open. It just isn't right now.

84
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.860
And that is, that is a problem, but it's not just affecting the gay community.

85
00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.940
It's I think everywhere.

86
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:00.300
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

87
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.160
Do you see that as sort of a direct offshoot of what identity politics has done?

88
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.400
Like if you don't identify enough as gay or the new thing is that you can be

89
00:05:08.401 --> 00:05:13.320
gay. So there's like a, like a Peter teal peep, Buddha judge,

90
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.630
maybe the way we are a little bit version of gay,

91
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.310
but we're not sort of like we don't prescribe to the whole set of

92
00:05:20.311 --> 00:05:24.380
ideas. It's not enough to be an out gay person living in West Hollywood,

93
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.690
you know, from LA for, you know, 50 years. That's that,

94
00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:28.920
that doesn't quite get it.

95
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.930
<v 0>But yeah, but you'll have to understand.</v>

96
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.730
I kind of made my way through that in the eighties as a young writer.

97
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.480
And I knew, uh, I was in what I call the glass closet,

98
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.840
meaning everyone I knew, knew I was gay.

99
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.480
And I had a partner when I talked to the media.

100
00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:49.260
I couched it back in those days. Basically,

101
00:05:49.261 --> 00:05:54.030
if you came out and you were a gay writer, you were get a wise two degree,

102
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.040
you were, uh, put into the gay section of bookstores.

103
00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:00.590
I don't think they have those anymore. I'm not sure if they did,

104
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.240
but they did have them. And it meant a kind of death in a way for, for,

105
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.860
for a mainstream acceptance.

106
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.030
<v 2>Right. So even if you weren't writing about gay things specifically,</v>

107
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.740
sort of you were gay so up, right? Look, I was on the gay channel on Sirius XM.

108
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.930
It was ridiculous. I didn't want to be on the gay channel.

109
00:06:16.931 --> 00:06:19.440
I wanted to be on any of the politics channels. I begged them,

110
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.000
put me on the left channel, they'll be on the right channel, the other channel,

111
00:06:22.001 --> 00:06:23.890
anything. But they were like, well, you're gay, right?

112
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:24.820
What do we do with the game?

113
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.160
<v 0>Exactly. Which is the problem.</v>

114
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.760
And that is what I always resisted because I knew I was so much more than simply

115
00:06:30.761 --> 00:06:33.310
gay or were who I wanted to have sex with.

116
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.190
I always knew that from a very early age, that I was a writer,

117
00:06:36.191 --> 00:06:38.470
that I was a person that I like movies, that I,

118
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.000
all these things that I wanted to do.

119
00:06:40.001 --> 00:06:43.690
And then there was gay somewhere over here and I never felt the need to make

120
00:06:43.691 --> 00:06:46.570
that the number one aspect of my identity.

121
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.580
I don't even think I even came out to anybody.

122
00:06:48.581 --> 00:06:52.480
It just sort of happened gradually, Oh, you're bringing Jim to the party or, Oh,

123
00:06:52.481 --> 00:06:54.910
Jim's coming for the weekend or whatever. And that was how it was.

124
00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:00.190
I really didn't think that anyone kind of what I deserve a tearful coming out

125
00:07:00.191 --> 00:07:01.870
from me. And I never even felt that,

126
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.080
that now that's not to say that people needed to go through that narrative and

127
00:07:05.081 --> 00:07:08.860
that's, and that's fine, but I just didn't tie myself into,

128
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:13.870
with a gay identity. Um, and so I do think that that is a problem,

129
00:07:13.871 --> 00:07:18.400
but again, not just Don, not just for gay people, but for people of color,

130
00:07:18.401 --> 00:07:22.960
for women, it really had. But I also believe they,

131
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:28.270
that this is an online problem in a way there is an offline world out

132
00:07:28.271 --> 00:07:29.104
there.

133
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.470
<v 2>All that thing, that thing still exists, which are we right now?</v>

134
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.040
<v 0>We're I think we're having an offline conversation.</v>

135
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.900
I hope I live my entire life offline to a degree, even, even when I'm online.

136
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:41.980
And I have done that.

137
00:07:41.981 --> 00:07:44.170
I've gone into a lot of trouble over the past decade or so,

138
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.670
but I think there's an offline world and I am I'm part of it.

139
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:53.470
And I know that the way women and men and gay people express themselves are very

140
00:07:53.471 --> 00:07:56.530
different than how they express themselves online.

141
00:07:56.531 --> 00:07:59.200
And that is kind of where we're at right now.

142
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:04.060
And I think a lot of people are too afraid to say things that they say offline

143
00:08:04.061 --> 00:08:06.850
online, and we'll just see where this plays out.

144
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.580
<v 2>So it's funny you bring that up because I was going to mention a little bit</v>

145
00:08:09.581 --> 00:08:12.910
later, so this is jumping ahead that American psycho it's almost to me,

146
00:08:12.911 --> 00:08:16.330
which was your third novel, right. It was the third novel that it's like,

147
00:08:16.331 --> 00:08:19.480
we're all sort of behaving like American psycho now, you know, it'd be like,

148
00:08:19.481 --> 00:08:22.780
we're all sort of sane in the functional world, in the real world. Right.

149
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.190
And then everyone with their secret avatars and their anonymous accounts or

150
00:08:27.191 --> 00:08:32.050
whatever is a psychopath online. So maybe, maybe there's your SQL or something.

151
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.520
<v 0>Oh, that's really interesting. I mean,</v>

152
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:38.350
I talk a lot about the creation of American psycho in the book,

153
00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:43.030
white and for some reason it's haunted me because it was something that I really

154
00:08:43.031 --> 00:08:47.500
thought was going to be this strange experimental novel that maybe 3000 people

155
00:08:47.501 --> 00:08:49.930
read. I thought it was so weird. So out there,

156
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.490
so super violent and pornographic that

157
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.510
never find it because it costs you some stuff we can get to that massage.

158
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.420
Monistic saying that I'm saying what the criticism of massaging,

159
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:06.240
just because there's acts of massage and he doesn't mean the book is massage.

160
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:08.310
And of course, so, um,

161
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:11.070
so I really didn't think that many people were going to read it,

162
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:15.810
but I also think that one of the reasons why it's still look popular

163
00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:19.830
today and still in print and tons of people read the book. Um,

164
00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:21.090
a lot of it has to do with the movie.

165
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.940
The movie definitely made people really interested in the book was because

166
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:28.210
Patrick Bateman is kind of a curator of his life in a way, uh,

167
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:33.110
very much the way people are now. I mean, a lot of, uh, American psycho.

168
00:09:33.111 --> 00:09:36.480
It was almost as if Patrick Bateman is showing you a series of selfies on his

169
00:09:36.481 --> 00:09:37.140
Instagram.

170
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.800
He's constantly describing his life and what he's wearing and what he's eating

171
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.180
and where he's going.

172
00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:45.300
And what restaurant is that add and what dishes he's eating in the restaurant.

173
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:50.370
It basically is how people treat their lives today from this kind of like

174
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.380
almost God's eye view of, you know, not living or participating in it,

175
00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:57.930
but actually just like photographing it.

176
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.430
