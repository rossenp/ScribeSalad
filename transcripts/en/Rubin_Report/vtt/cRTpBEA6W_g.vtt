1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.890
<v 0>No. I started the race to run for Congress.</v>

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.670
And part of that reason was because Maxine waters trying to get help with my VA

3
00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:09.660
benefits. Um, I was sleeping outside the lighthouse of renter's promise Virtus,

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.240
and I was going to her office every other day, trying to get help.

5
00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:14.400
I filled out job applications, internships.

6
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:17.010
I even bought her flowers and I was met with silence.

7
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.850
And that really made me upset because the majority of the people who live on the

8
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:24.210
streets are homeless veterans and they ain't 60% of them are black.

9
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.880
And so you have this lady who says, well, I'm pro black,

10
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.400
this pro black that I fight for black people, all of this stuff.

11
00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:32.070
And here I am a young black man and you're not fighting for me.

12
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:35.070
We have 44,000 homeless people in the streets.

13
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:39.150
60% of them are black veterans. You're not fighting for those people. So which,

14
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.670
which black people are you fighting for?

15
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.240
<v 2>I'm Dave Rubin. And this is the Rubin report.</v>

16
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.150
We're doing a mini interview today with Joe Collins.

17
00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:57.710
Joe is a us Navy veteran and a Republican running for Congress in Los Angeles,

18
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.610
his 43rd district, looking to unseat Maxine waters.

19
00:01:01.611 --> 00:01:04.760
Who's been in Congress for a cool 44 years.

20
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.020
I caught wind to Joe after his viral campaign ad that I'm sure many of you have

21
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:12.740
seen. So we're going to show you just a bite of that and then get right to the

22
00:01:12.741 --> 00:01:14.570
interview with Joe. Here we go.

23
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.560
<v 0>I'm Joe Collins. I'm running for Congress against Maxine waters.</v>

24
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.090
Do you know where I am right now?

25
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.900
Maxine waters is $6 million matching.

26
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.760
Do you know where I'm not right now? Maxine waters district. Yup. That's right.

27
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.790
Maxine does not live in our district, but I do.

28
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.500
I was born right here in South LA and the place Maxine refuses to live.

29
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.760
Maxine waters does not drink our water. She does not breathe our air.

30
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.600
And while she sits here and her mansion, our district is in ruins.

31
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:48.583
Let me show you.

32
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.880
This is South LA. I was born here. I grew up on 140.

33
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.690
Normally Maxine waters has been in office for 44 years.

34
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.060
Has anything got better around here?

35
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.280
I can tell you firsthand that it hasn't ossified the drive by shooting and this

36
00:02:10.281 --> 00:02:14.000
house when I was a child gangs, drugs, violence.

37
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.050
That was my upbringing. And where was Maxine waters? Nowhere to be found,

38
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.460
Joe, how's it going today? Good. How are you?

39
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.730
<v 2>I'm doing well. I'm doing well. So look, you put that,</v>

40
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.140
that add up and much like the Kim classic attic caught fire,

41
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.900
uh, are our new people heading your way?

42
00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:34.820
Do you feel like you have some momentum right now?

43
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.890
<v 0>Oh yeah. Um, you know, uh, success leaves clues,</v>

44
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:43.570
and we saw what Kim did and we absolutely, you know, you know,

45
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.720
did one of our own and people have been coming our way for a very long time.

46
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:48.830
We'll be getting a lot of support.

47
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.910
But I think one of the biggest things is we had to actually shine a light on how

48
00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:55.100
Maxine is compared to how we live in a district.

49
00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:57.200
And we absolutely nailed it with that.

50
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.910
<v 2>Yeah. All right. So before we, to a little bit, a little of your history,</v>

51
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:03.070
which is pretty amazing, and you've done some great stuff,

52
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.270
let's talk about Maxine waters because in the ad you talk about the fact that

53
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:10.210
she lives in a $6 million mansion.

54
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.130
That is not in that district. If I'm not mistaken, she's in Hancock park,

55
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:18.040
which is a pretty swanky swanky area of LA,

56
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.070
obviously not South central. Uh,

57
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.950
but that she's also been in business and by business,

58
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:26.500
I mean government for 44 years,

59
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.010
how did she get a $6 million mansion,

60
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:32.590
which I don't begrudge someone earning money, honestly,

61
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.510
but in 44 years of public service,

62
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:36.760
you usually don't think of someone getting a $6 million mansion.

63
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.610
<v 0>Yeah. You know, she has a ton of mansions. And, um, from doing research,</v>

64
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.370
I've seen a lot of backhanded things that she's been doing, you know,

65
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.020
pocket pads and all that other type of stuff. And, uh, we have to say, you know,

66
00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:50.010
it has to be corruption.

67
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.850
She's been labeled the most corrupt politician five times by the citizens where

68
00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:56.280
ethics committee, she has a,

69
00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.990
she has her own page and the judicial watch, uh, called career corruption.

70
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.650
And, uh, it features Maxine waters and everything she's been doing.

71
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:06.990
She's gotten a lot of backend deal. She's even,

72
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.380
she's even ripped off politicians. Um, here in California, she put,

73
00:04:10.381 --> 00:04:15.240
they pay her $45,000 for an endorsement and another, you know, 10,

74
00:04:15.241 --> 00:04:18.690
15, $20,000 to get on her slate, Merlot scheme that she, I was going. So,

75
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.160
I mean, when it comes to the corruption of,

76
00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:23.820
of Maxine waters that knows no limit. Yeah.

77
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.150
<v 2>So, all right. I don't want to get too lost on Maxine. Cause I think your,</v>

78
00:04:27.151 --> 00:04:30.840
your feelings about her are clear and I have a feeling most of my audience

79
00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:31.940
probably agrees with you, but,

80
00:04:31.941 --> 00:04:36.180
but let's talk about you because I don't think most people think that wait,

81
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.650
a black Republican from South central could, that could, that possibly exist.

82
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.590
Now we know a lot of stereotypes are being broken these days,

83
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.660
but can you tell me a little bit about your history?

84
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.460
<v 0>So yeah, I'm from South central Los Angeles. I was born and raised there and,</v>

85
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.560
uh, we ended up having to move to Texas, um,

86
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.980
after my house was shot up at a drive-by. So I was already in high school.

87
00:04:55.981 --> 00:04:58.940
So I ended up finishing high school in Texas. I graduated in 2003,

88
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.920
joined the Navy in 2004. That's where I became a Republican.

89
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.510
And the reason why is because in the history of, um, of black people,

90
00:05:06.511 --> 00:05:10.440
we see that the first black man to get involved in politics were Republicans.

91
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.010
And that's what the Republican party stood for. Freedom. Uh,

92
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.090
antislavery fight for your rights. And that's what resonated with me.

93
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.790
<v 2>So what possessed you to possibly go into politics or cut your</v>

94
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.690
comeback after the Navy? Uh, and what, what possessed you to say, all right,

95
00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:28.830
I'm going to throw my hat in the ring.

96
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.190
<v 0>I actually got out the military to get involved in politics. I take a, uh,</v>

97
00:05:33.191 --> 00:05:36.090
I got an administrative separation general under honorable conditions,

98
00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:39.330
so I can still career in politics. And it was because, uh,

99
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.680
through the 2016 election, the voice of the younger people were not being heard.

100
00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:46.320
And everybody called this lazy millennials, they called us lazy.

101
00:05:46.321 --> 00:05:48.430
They said we were worthless. We couldn't do anything. And,

102
00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:52.110
and mind you in the Navy and the entire military in itself,

103
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.950
it's about 4 million millennials that wake up every day at four o'clock in the

104
00:05:55.951 --> 00:05:59.600
morning, we do more between four and eight than most people do all day.

105
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.650
And so whenever we would bring our issues to the table, they'll say, wait,

106
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:05.870
or it's not your turn yet, or we're going to take care of it for you,

107
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:08.630
but our voice was never heard. And so I wanted our voice to be heard.

108
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.270
So I got out the military, hop into politics.

109
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.470
I actually started off as a presidential candidate. And, um, you know,

110
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.330
after I learned a lot, because you know,

111
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:19.130
you can't get involved in politics in the military.

112
00:06:19.131 --> 00:06:21.800
So I learned a lot as a presidential candidate. Then I started third,

113
00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:22.940
the race to run for Congress.

114
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.400
And part of that reason was because of Maxine waters,

115
00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:27.950
trying to get help with my VA benefits. Um,

116
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.250
I was sleeping outside the lighthouse of renter's probably Virtus and I was

117
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:33.260
going to her office every other day, trying to get help.

118
00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:36.470
I filled out job applications, internships, like, and bought her flowers.

119
00:06:36.471 --> 00:06:38.060
And I was met with silence.

120
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.900
And that really made me upset because the majority of the people who live on the

121
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:45.260
streets are homeless veterans and they ain't 60% of them are black.

122
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.930
And so you have this lady who says, well, I'm pro black,

123
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.450
this pro black that I fight for black people, all of this stuff.

124
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:53.120
And here I am a young black man and you're not fighting for me.

125
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:56.120
We have 44,000 homeless people in the streets.

126
00:06:56.121 --> 00:07:00.200
60% of them are black veterans. You're not fighting for those people. So which,

127
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.110
which black people are you fighting for? You know? And so she has to,

128
00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:04.130
she got her, she got to go.

129
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.990
<v 2>Yeah. So why is it, you know, I'm in LA as well.</v>

130
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.940
And why is it,

131
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.120
do you think that people in LA and really California as a whole,

132
00:07:13.121 --> 00:07:17.860
but I think LA and San Francisco specifically seem unable to connect the dots

133
00:07:17.861 --> 00:07:22.570
between always voting in Democrats and things always getting

134
00:07:22.571 --> 00:07:25.240
worse. They seem to not be able to realize, Oh,

135
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.810
we keep doing the same thing and things keep going the wrong direction.

136
00:07:28.811 --> 00:07:32.080
Maybe we got to vote in some other people. Have you figured out why that is?

137
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.260
<v 0>I think it's because when it,</v>

138
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.440
when it comes to politics and this is something that I've noticed, um, you know,

139
00:07:38.441 --> 00:07:41.440
a lot of candidates don't run to when they want to be famous,

140
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.090
they wouldn't be social media influencers.

141
00:07:43.091 --> 00:07:47.170
So they don't put in the necessary work that it takes to, um, to win a campaign,

142
00:07:47.171 --> 00:07:49.030
to, to raise money, to get their messages out.

143
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.260
And so that's what we've been seeing for a very long time. People want change,

144
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:55.750
but if they don't know you exist, they can't vote for you.

145
00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.680
<v 2>Yeah. So, so what are the things that you want to do? I mean,</v>

146
00:07:59.681 --> 00:08:02.860
we all know the homeless situation in LA is, is just,

147
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:07.060
it almost seems like every week it gets worse. What are some of like the heart,

148
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.210
give me like three, four of just the,

149
00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:11.860
the linchpin things that you want to accomplish and how you're going to do it.

150
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:13.361
<v 0>Okay. Well,</v>

151
00:08:13.361 --> 00:08:17.410
I have my five point plan and the reason why I came to Chicago with all five,

152
00:08:17.411 --> 00:08:19.570
let's do it. All right.

153
00:08:19.571 --> 00:08:23.790
So I want to rebuild the infrastructure to support the expansion of, uh,

154
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.530
small businesses, as well as housing. Um,

155
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:29.860
I want to overhaul the education and start rebuilding our high schools in the

156
00:08:29.861 --> 00:08:32.800
43rd district. I want to bring quality jobs back, um,

157
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.890
improve the relationship between the law enforcement and the community.

158
00:08:35.891 --> 00:08:39.340
And I also want to bring financial literacy back. And these are just basics,

159
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:43.360
basic things that you need in order to have a productive, positive society.

160
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.810
So we have to get back to the basics and, you know, you asked, how am I do it?

161
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.770
It's, it's easy. You just go to work and you do your job.

162
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.160
And I know that on a private capacity, what we've been able to do, um,

163
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:57.210
with the campaign I've been able to do in the community, uh,

164
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.110
as far as bringing jobs and taking care of our community COVID-19 is absolutely

165
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:03.360
possible. And it's easy. You just have to want to do it.

166
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.560
<v 2>Yeah. Let's talk about the policing situation,</v>

167
00:09:06.561 --> 00:09:09.300
because obviously everyone's talking about that all the time. Uh,

168
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:14.180
w w what do you make about the relations between the police and I hate phrases

169
00:09:14.181 --> 00:09:16.610
like the black community, but, you know,

170
00:09:16.611 --> 00:09:19.220
with at least the constituents in your district right now.

171
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:25.280
<v 0>It's kind of tough because everybody overemphasizes the, um,</v>

172
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.380
the issues of police brutality and inner cities,

173
00:09:27.381 --> 00:09:31.190
and they ignore everything else that we have going on in our communities.

174
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.670
And a lot of times, um, you know, when you hear,

175
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.700
or a black person was shot by a cop, it has to be racism.

176
00:09:37.701 --> 00:09:40.910
Even though the cop was either black or the cop was Latino, um,

177
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:44.090
who shot the guy? Uh, it has to be racist for some point.

178
00:09:44.091 --> 00:09:46.250
And then they always point out, well, cops did this,

179
00:09:46.251 --> 00:09:47.480
and cops did that all the time.

180
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.180
And having someone like Maxine waters coming to the community,

181
00:09:50.181 --> 00:09:51.050
doesn't make it easy.

182
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.260
Having organizations like black lives matter coming into the community,

183
00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:56.540
doesn't make it any easy because, you know,

184
00:09:56.541 --> 00:09:58.280
if we have such an issue with police,

185
00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.680
then what we need to be working on is police reform.

186
00:10:00.681 --> 00:10:03.860
We need to get social training within our police departments.

187
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.560
We need to get better oversight committees within our police department.

188
00:10:06.561 --> 00:10:09.710
We need to increase the budget so we can have better training for our police

189
00:10:09.711 --> 00:10:12.380
department. And these are things that people are bringing to the table,

190
00:10:12.381 --> 00:10:15.770
but these are things that I've been able to work with. Um, the mayor on,

191
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.450
and we've been doing a really good job.

192
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.540
So we've been standing in the gap between the,

193
00:10:19.541 --> 00:10:22.400
the police department and the community, making sure things they come.

194
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.460
And a lot of people from the, you know, black lives matter organization,

195
00:10:25.461 --> 00:10:28.760
don't like it because they raised money off hatred and fear.

196
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:30.140
But at the end of the day,

197
00:10:30.141 --> 00:10:32.780
when it comes to taking responsibility for the community,

198
00:10:32.781 --> 00:10:35.590
this is something that, you know, me and my team has done has been.

199
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.800
<v 2>Yeah. So I'm not a huge fan of Eric, our city,</v>

200
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:44.030
our mayor here in LA. Can you want to try to sell me on him a little bit?

201
00:10:44.031 --> 00:10:46.460
Or is this just one thing you've been able to work with him on.

202
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.210
<v 0>No, I'm not going to sell anybody on, on mayor Garcetti,</v>

203
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.550
cause he's never sold anybody on me.

204
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.710
But I think when you're in a leadership position,

205
00:10:54.711 --> 00:10:58.250
it is your obligation to work with the people who are leaders in order to affect

206
00:10:58.251 --> 00:10:58.940
better change.

207
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.030
And I don't have a problem with working with anybody if it's going to create

208
00:11:02.031 --> 00:11:06.020
some type of positive change. Um, do I like him personally? Maybe he's a,

209
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.350
he's a us Navy sailor. Do I like his policies? You know, sometimes I do,

210
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.440
sometimes I don't, but at the end of the day, if we could take some,

211
00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.520
some type of, uh, some type of medium ground to,

212
00:11:15.521 --> 00:11:18.200
to build some type of relationships to improve our communities, I'm with it.

213
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.870
<v 2>Yeah. So backing up for just a sec,</v>

214
00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:25.280
w when you hear people talk about defunding the police and everything else,

215
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:28.910
I've heard, a lot of people basically say, this is just like a media construct.

216
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:32.580
Like nobody really wants it done. Is that what you're hearing from?

217
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.920
<v 0>Um, nobody's going to defy the police department. I mean,</v>

218
00:11:36.921 --> 00:11:39.290
when you look at the amount of gang violence and gun violence,

219
00:11:39.291 --> 00:11:43.760
domestic violence and drugs and alcohol related incidents, and, and, um,

220
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.830
you know, all these cases in our communities,

221
00:11:45.831 --> 00:11:47.750
you absolutely don't want to defund the police.

222
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.530
The crazy part about it is the same people who talk about defunding police are

223
00:11:51.531 --> 00:11:54.340
the same people who call the police. Something happens to him, you know,

224
00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:55.900
so it's never going to happen.

225
00:11:55.901 --> 00:11:58.480
It's like a red hair and it's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my entire

226
00:11:58.481 --> 00:11:59.130
life.

227
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.720
<v 2>Yeah. W what do you make about just the,</v>

228
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.350
the general state of politics right now? Not just your district,

229
00:12:04.351 --> 00:12:08.860
not just Maxine waters, but like what's happening nationally. Trump Biden, the,

230
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.920
the, the over an intense focus on politics all day long. What do you think?

231
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.450
<v 0>I, I think it's a mess.</v>

232
00:12:15.451 --> 00:12:18.300
I think this is the complete reason why we need term limits.

233
00:12:18.301 --> 00:12:22.290
We have politicians who refused to work together. Everybody want to be right,

234
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.650
but they're trying to implement the same things that they had in the seventies

235
00:12:25.651 --> 00:12:27.840
and eighties. It didn't work, then it's not going to work now.

236
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.290
And we have a president who's struggling trying to get things done for our

237
00:12:31.291 --> 00:12:34.680
country. And, you know, people just don't want to work together. So, uh,

238
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.590
we got to get these people out of office and went on every single level.

239
00:12:37.591 --> 00:12:38.520
At some point,

240
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:42.720
these politicians should have been aged out and created an Avenue for new,

241
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.090
a younger politicians with fresh ideas.

242
00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.630
<v 2>Yeah. All right. Well, listen, I wish we had more time, but, uh,</v>

243
00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.900
we did this one on the fly just cause I saw the ad and I want it to help get the

244
00:12:51.901 --> 00:12:52.260
word out.

245
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:56.880
I hope to see you in real life in LA your neighborhood or mine is fine with me,
