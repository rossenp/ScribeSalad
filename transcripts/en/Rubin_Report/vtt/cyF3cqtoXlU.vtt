00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.010
<v 0>In California, they did something really sneaky.</v>

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.720
They put this curriculum into the anti-bullying curriculum.

3
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:10.020
So usually you would think this would go into the sex ed curriculum,

4
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:12.090
which parents are allowed to opt out of,

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.930
but they put it into the anti-bullying curriculum under the pretext that you

6
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:17.880
couldn't possibly police bullying,

7
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.020
unless you taught every child that only they know their true gender.

8
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.860
And of course we know that's nonsense because you,

9
00:00:24.861 --> 00:00:28.920
you can absolutely police bullying and should police bullying against sexual

10
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:30.780
minorities and every other student,

11
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.110
without introducing everybody to a,

12
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:36.120
to a false ideology.

13
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.970
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

14
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.170
<v 2>The five is about the schools.</v>

15
00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:48.740
And I think this is kind of fascinating because we've sort of just watched

16
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.200
intellectual rot run across all of our schools. And you,

17
00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:57.980
you just have to kind of go with whatever the thing of the day is.

18
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.720
Um, how much of this is just sort of being taught at public schools.

19
00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:04.340
Do you think, I know it depends what state you're in,

20
00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:06.230
but here we are both in Cali.

21
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.260
<v 0>So in California, right? It's very extreme in this state.</v>

22
00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:16.080
So it, gender identity, education is something you can't opt out of.

23
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.760
It begins in kindergarten and it's really extreme. We start by teaching,

24
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.060
you know, five-year-olds that, whatever, however, they were born,

25
00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:27.980
a doctor just made a guess and only they know their true gender and this doesn't

26
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.550
push kids to transition necessarily.

27
00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:35.420
But what it does do is the moment these young girls in particular hit

28
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.480
adolescence. They go through a period where they hate their own bodies.

29
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.920
They feel ugly. This is something nearly every woman will, can attest to, um,

30
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.700
the,

31
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.270
the solution readily leaps to mind because it's something they've learned about

32
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:49.700
for years. And it's that, Oh my gosh,

33
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.280
I know why I'm so uncomfortable in my body.

34
00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:53.660
It's because I'm supposed to be a boy.

35
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.880
<v 2>Were you able to figure out at all how these bad ideas get so</v>

36
00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:02.420
influential at all the schools seemingly all the schools,

37
00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:05.780
at least in California, but we, but New York too, and, and all over the country,

38
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.850
just how infectious the ideas are.

39
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.960
<v 0>Right?</v>

40
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.230
So I was a little bit because I was able to get a lot of documents out of the

41
00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:16.550
California teachers association, concerned teachers send them, sent them to be,

42
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.030
uh, sent them to me. And, um, there are,

43
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.590
there's really no division in California between the activists and the teachers,

44
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.460
activists are not only training the teachers. They are, um,

45
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.210
providing all the curriculum for, you know, um,

46
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.820
gender identity and sexual orientation education.

47
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.500
So it's coming from very extreme sources and in teachers who are a little

48
00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:43.130
uncomfortable about it are completely intimidated into silence.

49
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.350
<v 2>So when you say that at five years old, they're, they're taught this, um,</v>

50
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.070
for the average parent that might go into that school and say, well,

51
00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:54.860
I don't want my child hearing that at five years old, which no, five-year-old,

52
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:56.690
it has nothing to do with even what's true or not.

53
00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.400
No five-year-old can comprehend this stuff that, that in effect,

54
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:02.500
that person is going to be blacklisted.

55
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:04.990
And God only knows what they'll do to the poor kid.

56
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.910
<v 0>That that's right. You can't because in California,</v>

57
00:03:08.911 --> 00:03:10.200
they did something really sneaky.

58
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.910
They put this curriculum into the anti-bullying curriculum.

59
00:03:14.911 --> 00:03:18.210
So usually you would think this would go into the sex ed curriculum,

60
00:03:18.211 --> 00:03:20.280
which parents are allowed to opt out of,

61
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.120
but they put it into the anti-bullying curriculum under the pretext that you

62
00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:26.070
couldn't possibly police bullying,

63
00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:30.210
unless you taught every child that only they know their true gender.

64
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.030
And of course we know that's nonsense because you,

65
00:03:33.031 --> 00:03:37.110
you can absolutely police bullying and should police bullying against sexual

66
00:03:37.111 --> 00:03:38.970
minorities and every other student,

67
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.270
without introducing everybody to a,

68
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.310
to a false ideology.

69
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.720
<v 2>Do you have any numbers on what percentage of the public school teachers like</v>

70
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.570
actually buy it versus who's just going along.

71
00:03:51.571 --> 00:03:53.040
I guess that would be hard to quantify.

72
00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.280
<v 0>It's very hard. Public school teachers are terrified. I have,</v>

73
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.480
I spoke to one teacher who posted something on social media was very tame.

74
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.000
She said, I don't know, this seems to be confusing.

75
00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:07.260
A lot of kids at my school effectively. And she was suspended immediately,

76
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.340
and this was on her private, um, Facebook page. So, um,

77
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.100
teachers are very, very afraid. Yeah.

78
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.390
<v 2>So the next chapter is the moms and dads, which speaking of very, very afraid,</v>

79
00:04:18.391 --> 00:04:20.190
it seems like a lot of the moms and dads are too.

80
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.510
<v 0>Yeah. They're afraid. They're afraid to lose custody. And these are, you know,</v>

81
00:04:24.511 --> 00:04:28.500
the parents who call me are overwhelmingly political Progressive's they are

82
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.870
proud allies. They've always been allies, but, um, the,

83
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.360
their only sort of hesitation is problem is they think, gosh,

84
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.860
this came out of nowhere. I mean,

85
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:40.020
I supported her when she said that she was a lesbian,

86
00:04:40.021 --> 00:04:43.800
but now she's saying she's a boy and she wants to have her breasts removed.

87
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.700
I mean, I'm not sure that's right for her. And isn't, couldn't she regret it.

88
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.540
These are the most sort of obvious questions.

89
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.150
There's nothing hateful about these questions.

90
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.200
But today these parents are treated like bigots, they're isolated,

91
00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.580
their friends drop them,

92
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.180
and very often friends will go behind their backs to send their daughters

93
00:05:03.181 --> 00:05:07.260
encouragement by way of a binder that one of those compression garments or

94
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:12.090
otherwise, you know, castigate them for, for, for bigotry. Allegedly.

95
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.720
<v 2>What did this teach you maybe, or you're a parent yourself. I mean,</v>

96
00:05:15.721 --> 00:05:18.750
did this teach you anything about parenting in general and,

97
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.630
and setting rules and being honest and the rest of it?

98
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.681
<v 0>Sure.</v>

99
00:05:22.681 --> 00:05:27.390
I think one thing it taught me was really how much we've

100
00:05:27.391 --> 00:05:29.010
over relied on experts.

101
00:05:29.011 --> 00:05:33.780
These so-called experts who show up and claim to know more than we do

102
00:05:33.781 --> 00:05:35.790
about our kids that we have spent. I don't know,

103
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.990
hundreds of thousands of hours raising. And I, and I think that, um,

104
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.620
I think that trusting your own instincts about what's right for your daughter.

105
00:05:43.621 --> 00:05:46.560
I mean, if you, in many cases, parents will call me and they,

106
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.660
it just doesn't sit right with them,

107
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.340
but they are being pressured by the mental health establishment or doctors to

108
00:05:53.341 --> 00:05:55.500
immediately agree with their daughter and,

109
00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.290
and fast tracker to irreversible consequences that she's likely to

110
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:01.124
regret.

111
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.540
<v 2>So since you said the P word Progressive's,</v>

112
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.280
do you sense that there is a connection between sort of being

113
00:06:09.281 --> 00:06:13.900
politically progressive and that he would end up in a situation like this,

114
00:06:13.901 --> 00:06:16.660
that you sort of just, yes, everything goes all the time.

115
00:06:16.661 --> 00:06:19.540
There is nothing that's really true per se,

116
00:06:19.541 --> 00:06:24.010
and everything is sort of how you feel that this was the obvious outcome of it

117
00:06:24.011 --> 00:06:24.844
in a weird way.

118
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.070
<v 0>Well, I think Mike,</v>

119
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.030
my take is that the reason so many progressive families have,

120
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.870
have fallen into this and let me say conservative families have as well.

121
00:06:34.871 --> 00:06:35.920
But the reason it's,

122
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.150
it does seem to me majority progressive families is because they were less

123
00:06:40.151 --> 00:06:42.520
skeptical of the culture. Um,

124
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.510
conservatives have known for a long time that social a social worker or a

125
00:06:46.511 --> 00:06:51.190
psychologist might not, um, treat their values with respect,

126
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.930
but liberals were genuinely taken aback and completely caught off guard because

127
00:06:55.931 --> 00:06:59.140
they thought, wait a second, I've been an ally my entire life.

128
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.170
This isn't about that. It's about the mental health of my daughter.

129
00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:03.670
She's got anxiety, depression,

130
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.110
shouldn't we look at those things first and they were really assuming good faith

131
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:13.120
on behalf of, um, you know, frankly activists posing as doctors.

132
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:14.710
<v 2>Yeah. And we've just,</v>

133
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.460
it seems to me that that unfortunately for a lot of the liberals, and I think,

134
00:07:18.461 --> 00:07:20.560
you know, a little bit about my story, you know, for a lot of liberals,

135
00:07:20.561 --> 00:07:23.770
until something like this hits them, they think that there's,

136
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.120
there's nothing wrong there that, that it's just like, Oh, anything goes,

137
00:07:28.121 --> 00:07:29.260
and then next thing you know,

138
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.630
they're confronted with this and then they feel a little bit different.

139
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.330
<v 0>That's right. They,</v>

140
00:07:33.331 --> 00:07:37.060
they describe themselves now overwhelmingly as politically homeless.

141
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.670
And it's not because they feel conservative. Um, it's because they,

142
00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:45.610
they are really horrified that by the assault on their families. I mean, that,

143
00:07:45.611 --> 00:07:46.960
that, that all of these medical,

144
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:51.280
these mental health professionals and teachers would go behind their backs to

145
00:07:51.281 --> 00:07:55.630
encourage their children to do something that they think is harmful to them is,

146
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.940
is so stunning to them. And it really,

147
00:07:57.941 --> 00:08:02.800
it does make them really uncomfortable with, with progressive politics.

148
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.600
<v 2>Yeah. So did you have a sense,</v>

149
00:08:04.601 --> 00:08:09.520
or do you have a sense that conservative parents have some better mechanisms to

150
00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:13.450
fight this either by standing up to the school or maybe dealing with the child a

151
00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:15.190
little bit differently or whatever it might be?

152
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.470
<v 0>Yeah, it's interesting.</v>

153
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.330
I think conservative parents were tended to be and should

154
00:08:22.331 --> 00:08:24.760
be more skeptical of the culture.

155
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:29.920
They were more skeptical of the social workers and psychologists who claimed to

156
00:08:29.921 --> 00:08:34.030
know so much about their parents, but they also look their, you know, their,

157
00:08:34.031 --> 00:08:37.780
their default is that, what do you mean? You're suddenly a boy see,

158
00:08:37.781 --> 00:08:41.350
sometimes progressive parents were afraid to say that because they don't want to

159
00:08:41.351 --> 00:08:44.230
be big at it, but a conservative parent is,

160
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.470
might be more comfortable just saying, what do you mean? You've been a girl,

161
00:08:47.471 --> 00:08:50.500
your whole life. You're a girl. I mean, just because you want a short haircut,

162
00:08:50.501 --> 00:08:52.120
doesn't suddenly make you a boy.

163
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.770
<v 2>You're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about women's issues</v>

164
00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:59.430
