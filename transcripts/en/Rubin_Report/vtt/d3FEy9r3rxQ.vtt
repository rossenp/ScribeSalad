1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.140
<v 0>These are foods that are made because of the government helps support these</v>

2
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:08.130
commodity crops, which are 60% of our calories that people consume them.

3
00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:11.610
The most are the sickest globally. It kills 11 million people a year.

4
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:14.120
That's like a Holocaust, every single year,

5
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.550
people dying from eating the wrong foods and not eating the right foods.

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.030
And it's because our whole agricultural system has been moved to make those

7
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:25.500
foods which are causing heart disease, diabetes, cancer,

8
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.510
dementia, obviously obesity.

9
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.590
<v 1>I'm Dave Rubin. And this is the Rubin report.</v>

10
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.010
And joining me today is a doctor who is a leader in the field of functional

11
00:00:37.011 --> 00:00:40.730
medicine, as well as a 13 time, New York times,

12
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.210
best selling author. Uh, and his newest book is food.

13
00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:47.810
Fix how to save our health, our economy, our communities, and our planet.

14
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.110
One bite at a time Dr. Mark Hyman, welcome to the Rubin report.

15
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.730
Thanks for having me, Dave. I think that was my longest intro ever. I mean,

16
00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:57.140
this is a serious updated.

17
00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.730
<v 0>Cause that just hit the list yesterday.</v>

18
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.650
<v 1>I'm doing this on the timeline. You can see as I edited it right there,</v>

19
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.420
but it said 12 on the progress. Um,

20
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.310
I'm super psyched to talk to you because as I,

21
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.540
as I just said to you before we started getting away a little bit from politics

22
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.950
is always a nice break for me,

23
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.820
but this is not purely away from politics.

24
00:01:16.821 --> 00:01:18.050
So we're going to do a little of that.

25
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.570
<v 0>It's probably the most political issue of our time,</v>

26
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.850
even though we don't talk about it that way. Yeah.

27
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.670
<v 1>And, and quite literally you bit off a lot in this title,</v>

28
00:01:25.671 --> 00:01:30.410
because you talk about economics and communities and the planet and all of those

29
00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:34.100
things and how it's related. So before we get into any of that stuff,

30
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.150
how did you get into this field? What made you care about all of this stuff?

31
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.350
Where did it all come from?

32
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.450
<v 0>That's great. Well, I've always been interested in helping nutrition.</v>

33
00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:45.440
I grew up in Spain. My parents lived there for 11 years after the war.

34
00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:47.540
They missed the whole junk food, fast food,

35
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.520
processed food revolution in America.

36
00:01:49.521 --> 00:01:51.320
And I always grew up eating real whole food.

37
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.430
And in college I lived with a guy who was a nutrition PhD student,

38
00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.140
and he introduced me to this whole idea about nutrition against disease. Uh,

39
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.270
and I became a yoga teacher before I was a doctor.

40
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:07.010
And then I became a doctor and kind of got indoctrinated literally and became,

41
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.310
um, very focused on, you know, traditional good medicine,

42
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.900
but I realized the limits of it.

43
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:16.490
And I then got sick myself and ended up having to fix myself using

44
00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:20.330
functional medicine, which is looking at systems, looking at root causes.

45
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.020
And after 30 years of sitting in my office, seeing chronically ill patients,

46
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.041
which by the way,

47
00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:29.420
is six out of 10 Americans have a chronic disease that kills

48
00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:31.760
11 million people a year from food.

49
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.080
I realized that food was causing my patients to be sick and that I had to look

50
00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:39.800
at why they were eating the food they were eating. And then I thought, well,

51
00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:42.860
it's the food system? And I'm like, well, why do we have the food system?

52
00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:44.360
It's our food policies.

53
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.560
And then why do we have our policies is because of the food industry influence

54
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.770
driving our policies and some of it's legacy from good intentions.

55
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.200
Then we still have firm policies 15 and seven years ago.

56
00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:57.530
So current to me that I really want to cure my patients.

57
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.390
I have to step back and look at the big picture of what's wrong with our food

58
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:05.440
system. The impact is causing on disease on our economy,

59
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.910
on social justice issues, poverty, mental health, kids', academic performance,

60
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:11.650
national security environment, climate.

61
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.090
It's all one problem that is predominantly driven by our food and our food

62
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:19.990
system. And it's fixable. If food is the cause it's also the cure.

63
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.490
<v 1>And that's exactly what this book is about. Um.</v>

64
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.370
<v 0>It's called food fix not food apocalypse.</v>

65
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.750
<v 1>So we'll, we'll see about that. Give me another 50 minutes here. Um,</v>

66
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.150
so you know, I, I had your buddy max Luke of on,

67
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.220
and he was also talking about how funk, how regular Western medicine,

68
00:03:38.221 --> 00:03:40.650
when his mom got sick, um,

69
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.910
they did not have enough answers or it was as he calls it, diagnose and adios.

70
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.870
You, you just referenced something there about indoctrination and, uh,

71
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.500
relative to Western medicine and how they don't really talk about food.

72
00:03:52.501 --> 00:03:53.334
Can you explore that?

73
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.980
<v 0>Yeah. One Barry says, you know, um,</v>

74
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.460
the food system produces food with no paying,

75
00:03:59.461 --> 00:04:03.510
no attention to health and the healthcare system treats disease with no

76
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.183
attention to food.

77
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.180
And I think food is the biggest driver of chronic disease is something that, uh,

78
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.610
I've learned as, as a functional medicine doctor,

79
00:04:11.611 --> 00:04:15.180
that food is medicine and can heal, but it also can harm.

80
00:04:15.181 --> 00:04:20.010
And so that's really why I wrote this book was to sort of help our country and

81
00:04:20.011 --> 00:04:24.630
hopefully our global population understand that if we want to deal with some of

82
00:04:24.631 --> 00:04:27.900
the biggest crises we're facing today in America and globally,

83
00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:32.400
we have to focus on the food system. It's the most invisible cause it's,

84
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.970
there's no real conversation about it in the political discourse.

85
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.730
And yet it's probably the biggest political issue of our time.

86
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.430
<v 1>So since we're having the conversation right now,</v>

87
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.970
what are some of just like the basic things we should know about the foods we're

88
00:04:44.971 --> 00:04:48.510
eating and what we're being forced fed that we shouldn't eat,

89
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.820
maybe some things that we should be incorporating.

90
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.781
<v 0>Exactly.</v>

91
00:04:51.781 --> 00:04:56.700
So how we grow food from the seed to how we produce food

92
00:04:56.701 --> 00:05:01.500
and processed food to how we eat it and how we waste it is driving

93
00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:02.850
so much of our issues.

94
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.840
So the food we're producing predominantly today is what we call ultra processed

95
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.040
calories or ultra processed food. What is that? It's food made from a fuse,

96
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.270
simple ingredients, refined white flour, high fructose corn syrup,

97
00:05:15.271 --> 00:05:19.230
and other corn additives and ingredients and refined soybean oil that are turned

98
00:05:19.231 --> 00:05:23.430
into literally hundreds of thousands of processed foods that are all made from

99
00:05:23.431 --> 00:05:25.380
the same ingredients that are different colors,

100
00:05:25.381 --> 00:05:28.350
sizes and shapes of food like extruded substances.

101
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.940
And the frightening thing is the data is not fresh. That's what you're doing.

102
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.360
They're not fresh ingredients. You might even recognize you read.

103
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.530
If you cover the front of a Pop-Tart or a corn dog of the box,

104
00:05:40.531 --> 00:05:43.380
you probably could barely tell the difference in the ingredients, right?

105
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.270
And these are foods that are made because of the government helps support these

106
00:05:48.271 --> 00:05:52.260
commodity crops, which are 60% of our calories that people consume them.

107
00:05:52.261 --> 00:05:55.740
The most are the sickest globally. It kills 11 million people a year.

108
00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:58.250
That's like a Holocaust, every single year,

109
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:01.670
people dying from eating the wrong foods and not eating the right foods.

110
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.180
And it's because our whole agricultural system has been moved to make those

111
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:09.650
foods which are causing heart disease, diabetes, cancer,

112
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.630
dementia, obviously obesity. And it's frightening to me when I was born,

113
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.850
there were 5% of Americans who are obese. When I graduated medical school,

114
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.830
it was less than 20%.

115
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.470
There was not a single state that had an obesity rate over 20%.

116
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:30.020
Now it's 42% and most States have obesity rates over 40%.

117
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.220
That's 42% of Americans are obese, 75% overweight.

118
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.450
It's going to be one in two people in 10 years, that will be obese,

119
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.720
not just overweight. And this is crippling our economy.

120
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.640
We now have one in $3 in Medicare is spent for diabetes

121
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:49.730
alone. Our higher chronic disease epidemic.

122
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.940
80% of Medicare costs are from chronic disease.

123
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.280
We have one in three federal dollars that are spent on Medicare sooner.

124
00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.960
It will be one in two. I mean,

125
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:04.670
Medicare for our company would be the biggest company in the world with a $1.3

126
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.150
trillion a year budget. Wow. And, and a lot of that is unnecessary.

127
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.200
80% of that is unnecessary is caused by the food and the food system.

128
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.110
<v 1>So you mentioned the way our policies going back decades sort of led to some</v>

129
00:07:17.111 --> 00:07:21.040
abuse. Um, is there like a moment? Yeah. So here's what.

130
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:21.761
<v 0>It happened. You know,</v>

131
00:07:21.761 --> 00:07:25.810
nobody was like a big cabal of evil food companies that got together and said.

132
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.850
<v 1>I'm glad you started with that because I think that's right.</v>

133
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:28.743
People think that it's,

134
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.130
it's like these evil companies or the evil government that sit down and how do

135
00:07:33.131 --> 00:07:34.600
we screw over the most amount? Okay.

136
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.810
<v 0>It's the unintended consequences of good intentions, right?</v>

137
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.380
So after the world war II, there was a lot of hunger in the world.

138
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.050
There was a need to produce a lot of starchy calories,

139
00:07:44.051 --> 00:07:48.610
which we thought were good sources of carbohydrates and energy to fuel a growing

140
00:07:48.611 --> 00:07:53.230
population. And so industrial agriculture came onto the scene with,

141
00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:57.010
you know, mass mechanization with intensive use of fertilizers,

142
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.490
pesticides herbicides, which no one knew were bad at the time. I mean,

143
00:08:00.491 --> 00:08:03.100
silent spring was written in the sixties by Rachel Carson,

144
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.880
which expose a harm of DDT and pesticides that was eliminated till the

145
00:08:06.881 --> 00:08:09.790
seventies. Uh, and we didn't know that fertilizer,

146
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.540
woulds destroying oceans and lakes and rivers and killing, you know,

147
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.880
hundreds of thousands of tons of fish every year.

148
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.640
<v 1>Did really nobody know. I mean, I don't, I don't.</v>

149
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.800
<v 0>I believe that people really said, Oh, these pesticides,</v>

150
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.300
we're going to kill people. We're going to use them anyway.

151
00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:26.240
Or that glyphosate is going to cause cancer and destroy our microbiome.

152
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.590
<v 1>You think these companies, they really just, they thought they had answers.</v>

153
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:30.453
Yeah, of course.

154
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.630
<v 0>Create a, uh, a food for a growing population. Uh,</v>

155
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:37.090
but then people started to understand these things.

156
00:08:37.091 --> 00:08:40.420
And then the cat was out of the bag and they didn't want to lose the,

157
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.630
the business and the profitability of growing food in this way.

158
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.020
