1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.770
<v 0>Every single stereotype that was applied in the past toward poor, low status,</v>

2
00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:09.180
blacks was overnight by these same people applied to poor, low status whites.

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.050
You go back and watch that clip and those access they did do.

4
00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:16.950
And those voices hold those lines of that book learning. They are one sec,

5
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.480
they're 60 years away from saying the N word about the same kind of population.

6
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:22.770
It's a status thing.

7
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:26.940
And racism and classism have always been very hand in hand in this country

8
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.580
For a long time. The corporate press has been very good at using persuasion.

9
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.840
And now that the, you know,

10
00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:39.740
animus toward them is at all time highs and hopefully will keep escalating their

11
00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:43.130
mask is dropping and they're demonstrating. They're perfectly comfortable, uh,

12
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.790
using their B move, which is force if necessary. Do you think they think.

13
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.840
<v 2>They're getting away with it?</v>

14
00:00:47.841 --> 00:00:50.960
So a great example of this would be just what happened to Joe Rogan in the last

15
00:00:50.961 --> 00:00:53.870
little bit. So Rogan basically endorsed Bernie,

16
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.110
but he put not even quite right for him. He said, right? So he was,

17
00:00:57.111 --> 00:00:59.600
so everyone was saying it was an endorsement, but it was basically like,

18
00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:02.600
I liked the guy he's been consistent over the years. Something like that.

19
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.910
And CNN from CNN's main verified Twitter account literally

20
00:01:07.911 --> 00:01:12.500
said something to the effect of Bernie Sanders under heat,

21
00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:15.860
because he takes the endorsement of homophobic, racist,

22
00:01:15.861 --> 00:01:20.660
Islamophobic comedian, Joe Rogan. And it's like, know,

23
00:01:20.661 --> 00:01:22.580
you don't have to love Rogan. And I get it.

24
00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:25.580
He's been included on scary charts that you and I have been included on.

25
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.410
You know, these charts they're out there.

26
00:01:27.411 --> 00:01:31.280
Sometimes they put little lines next to each other and then it's like,

27
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.040
Oh my God, but that's not a conspiracy theory. Right. That's not. Yeah.

28
00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:36.410
You're right. Exactly. Exactly. And then, yeah. All right.

29
00:01:36.411 --> 00:01:40.880
We'll put that aside for a sec. Um, but when you see that it's like, Ooh,

30
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.100
they're they got almost nothing left. Yeah.

31
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.170
<v 0>This is the tactic of theirs that I've called out.</v>

32
00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:48.590
I have a master threat on Twitter. It's called as an aside. So for example,

33
00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:51.140
if I was describing you as someone who is an objective,

34
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.870
even bias let's suppose I have a biased journalist and I don't like you. Yeah.

35
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.670
I would still say Dave Rubin comma, who was a popular podcast or comma said,

36
00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:01.100
blah, blah, blah. Right? That's an accurate framing. Yeah.

37
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.110
Their first sentence is always to ascribe the most nefarious framing

38
00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:09.050
possible to this person. So the reader rara hold on,

39
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.290
Rita right away knows this is someone to avoid Joe Rogan,

40
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.700
comma who has a history of making homophobic and racist jokes. Comma.

41
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.490
If you had to describe Joe Rogan, look at this Wikipedia.

42
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.570
That's not what he's known as MMA comedian podcaster.

43
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.760
No one would define him that way,

44
00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:27.950
unless you are telling and training your audience,

45
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.920
what to think it's completely disingenuous.

46
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.520
And that's the difference between having a bias and having an agenda.

47
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.910
If it was a bias, they said, Joe Rogan, Poplar, cat has, however,

48
00:02:37.911 --> 00:02:40.100
he's gotten controversy for this. You show both sides.

49
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.590
That's not what they're doing. They're telling you front and center.

50
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.330
This person is the enemy and you should shun him. And what's beautiful is,

51
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.990
uh,

52
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.580
look who the corporate press has needlessly alienated through their chicanery

53
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.440
Rogan fans, Tulsi fans, Bernie fans, Andrew Yang, fans, Trump fans, Coby fans,

54
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.480
Don Imus fans. It's they can't help themselves. Because again,

55
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.280
when you have a fundamentalist faith,

56
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.460
you are certain that you're on the side of the angels.

57
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.100
<v 2>That is a tough one to fight, huh? Fine mess for us.</v>

58
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.170
<v 0>It's easy because they're delusional, not touch with reality. So as if you,</v>

59
00:03:16.171 --> 00:03:19.380
if there's an asymmetry between truth and lies, right?

60
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.810
If I tell you a hundred truths and one lie,

61
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.460
you're going to look at me as a liar.

62
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.520
If I kill one person and never kill anyone else, I'm still a murderer. Right?

63
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.870
So if I'm presenting myself as an objective news organization,

64
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.260
and I'm caught once, twice, 12 times,

65
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.710
the average person who doesn't have any political persuasion,

66
00:03:37.711 --> 00:03:42.120
one or another will not look at me as trustworthy. And once trust is lost,

67
00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:44.070
it is almost impossible to be regained.

68
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.420
<v 2>So with that in mind, let's talk about this clip that went viral, the CNN, uh,</v>

69
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.020
it's Don lemon, uh, who's their main anchor.

70
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.630
Don Don used to be a friend of mine. He was on this show.

71
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.340
I'm not here to throw the guy under the bus.

72
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.990
<v 0>Don lemon comma, who used to be.</v>

73
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.920
<v 2>Yeah, exactly. Who must be on a chart with Dave Rubin? Um,</v>

74
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.380
and it was Rick Wilson, who is a,

75
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.010
is he a Republican strategist supposedly? Right? I mean,

76
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.820
that's what it says under his name. And the other person was.

77
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.850
<v 0>For Reed. I forget his name. And I'm going to sound racist if I try. All right.</v>

78
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.280
<v 2>So we were right. And some other guy, but it's three of them.</v>

79
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.950
They've got their heads in boxes on CNN.

80
00:04:19.951 --> 00:04:22.380
And can you just describe what happened? And then the reaction,

81
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.630
it's such a perfect example of all of this.

82
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.490
<v 0>There was a lot to unpack in this clip.</v>

83
00:04:26.491 --> 00:04:31.200
So Rick Wilson was making the joke that Trump is so dumb that he couldn't find

84
00:04:31.201 --> 00:04:34.470
Ukraine on a map, right? This is, you know, one-on-one humor.

85
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.300
<v 2>Right? And Don lemon, it was.</v>

86
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.400
<v 0>There's this, there's this mental,</v>

87
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.430
there's this condition called Angelman syndrome. And when kids have it,

88
00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:42.930
they can't help but laugh all the time.

89
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.450
And it's kind of disturbing because there'll be in their crib, just cracking up.

90
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.600
And he just loses it as if it's the funniest thing he's ever heard.

91
00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:51.630
And I'm like, this is first grade playground stuff. It's not clever.

92
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.830
And they start going off on how all these Trump voters are like, Oh,

93
00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.600
you guys are elitist with your geography and your lines on the map. It all felt.

94
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.090
<v 2>Extremely produced. Like, do you think that was spontaneous?</v>

95
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.950
<v 0>I think it was very spontaneous riffing off each other. Here's my point.</v>

96
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.250
There's something I talk about in the book called nitwits and tell me why you

97
00:05:11.251 --> 00:05:12.780
think it's not that not spontaneous.

98
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.450
<v 2>Because the way they were riffing off each other,</v>

99
00:05:15.451 --> 00:05:19.020
these people don't riff off each other. Well, like when you see,

100
00:05:19.021 --> 00:05:22.830
when you see lemon and Cuomo do it, it's horrible.

101
00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:26.970
It's so stilted. You can tell these people don't really like each other.

102
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.030
They have this awkward minute between their shows when they do it.

103
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.730
And also I know a lot of these people, like, you know,

104
00:05:32.731 --> 00:05:37.020
a lot of people like the way they are and their ability to be human on camera.

105
00:05:37.021 --> 00:05:40.190
It's not like this. It literally, it's not like this,

106
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.110
what we're doing right now where it's like, we have cameras on us,

107
00:05:43.111 --> 00:05:44.880
but we're acting basically the same, you know,

108
00:05:44.881 --> 00:05:47.490
there's always like you turn the camera on. What's that, what's that theory,

109
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.090
you know, there's that,

110
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.550
there's a name for that theory when you turn the camera on. Oh, I don't know.

111
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.350
I can't remember what it's called, but,

112
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.680
but we're basically acting like ourselves and there's nothing suddenly that this

113
00:05:55.681 --> 00:05:59.030
camera goes off, that I'm going to, our interaction would be wildly different.

114
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.910
Right. We went out to dinner a couple weeks ago, is this right? As I said,

115
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.200
it began the show. This is how I dress up.

116
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.930
This is exactly what you were wearing. You were wearing the Tulsi,

117
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:08.600
the last slot that tells the appropriate. Right, right, right.

118
00:06:08.601 --> 00:06:09.434
I keep forgetting.

119
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.690
But so it struck me as the level that Don was laughing did not

120
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:17.510
strike me as uncontrollable after he'd struck me as uncontrollably,

121
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:19.010
fake laughter. Interesting.

122
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.160
And the way that they were all bouncing back and forth was like,

123
00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:25.820
they had planned this. Like they need something to go viral. Like,

124
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.741
I don't know you,

125
00:06:26.741 --> 00:06:29.510
you might be writing and maybe it's somewhere in between what we're both saying.

126
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.450
<v 0>Both theories are so stupid. It's hard to figure out which sports reality.</v>

127
00:06:34.451 --> 00:06:37.710
Right. I'm hearing what you're saying. And it's completely plausible.

128
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.950
They sat down and did like the worst improv class in history.

129
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.050
But there's a couple of things in that clip that I thought are very cogent.

130
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.440
There's this concept called Midwest. That is, I've mentioned my book,

131
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.900
which is about people who are marginally intelligent, right.

132
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.730
When you're barely smarter than average,

133
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.240
but you have debt are desperate to demonstrate your brilliance, right?

134
00:06:58.241 --> 00:07:00.670
Because there's very few chances where you're going to be the smart one.

135
00:07:00.671 --> 00:07:03.730
If you're six foot, you are tall, you're above average.

136
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.650
But when are you going to be the tall guy? Never.

137
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.930
So to think that being able to find Ukraine who everyone who's played

138
00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:12.010
risk can find,

139
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.220
it can be found on a map as a sign of your brilliance speaks to your

140
00:07:15.221 --> 00:07:17.190
intelligence. And the other point is Jim goad,

141
00:07:17.191 --> 00:07:18.940
the writer who wrote the redneck manifesto,

142
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.740
he made the point that every single stereotype that was applied in the past

143
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.120
toward poor, low status,

144
00:07:25.121 --> 00:07:29.530
blacks was overnight by these same people applied to poor, low status whites.

145
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.990
You go back and watch that clip and those access they did do. And those voices,

146
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.300
those lines in that book learning, they are one sec,

147
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.830
they're 60 years away from saying the N word about the same kind of population.

148
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.120
It's, it's a status thing.

149
00:07:43.121 --> 00:07:46.630
And racism and classism have always been very hand-in-hand.

150
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.030
<v 2>And in this country. So then what is going on in their minds,</v>

151
00:07:49.031 --> 00:07:50.020
in a segment like that,

152
00:07:50.021 --> 00:07:54.850
do they honestly think that they are helping whatever the cause is? Right?

153
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.760
<v 0>I think this is what I think. I think now they are in retreat.</v>

154
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.900
I think they get a lot of heat on social media where people call them out on

155
00:08:01.901 --> 00:08:05.620
their map, malfeasance and depravity, and they're getting defensive.

156
00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:09.910
And now they are being sarcastic because sarcasm is often a sign of cognitive

157
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.810
incident dissonance,

158
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.930
where your brain has to contradict your ideas and can't reconcile them.

159
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:19.120
So for them, the idea that maybe I always tweeted this, that these people, I go,

160
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.450
have you ever wondered if maybe you're one of the bad guys, uh,

161
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.180
the idea that we're not better than everyone else,

162
00:08:25.181 --> 00:08:28.540
that we're not particularly bright. It's true,

163
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.380
but it's very disturbing to their self image because, Hey, I'm on CNN,

164
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:36.850
I'm on a panel clearly. I'm brilliant. And no, Anna Navarro is on this.

165
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:39.640
She's not brilliant. She's William Howard Taft.

166
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:44.350
<v 2>Is also called me racist on Twitter. So, you know, comma. Yeah.</v>

167
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.540
Who's called Dave and racist comma. Um,

168
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.350
who sat down with Michael malice who was, you know, Tulsi, Gabbard,

169
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.310
appropriated the comma. Okay. Um, it reminds me of, um,

170
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.820
something that happened be about a year ago, a good friend of mine,

171
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.610
who I went to. I grew up with, I went to college with,

172
00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:03.330
we both studied political science together. We've been friends for, you know,

173
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:08.010
our whole lives or, you know, 40 some odd years. Um, he's a huge lefty now.

174
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.640
Obviously we diverged politically. Uh,

175
00:09:10.641 --> 00:09:13.890
but we went out for a drink and we sorta got into it and he was getting very

176
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:16.290
heated and I just kept trying to get out of politics.

177
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:19.290
I tried and I'm sure you've been in a million of these where you just,

178
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.350
you try to let it go. And there's something that's beyond politics.

179
00:09:22.351 --> 00:09:26.090
And I was trying to talk about his kids and everything else going on and he

180
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.520
couldn't get there. And I finally said to him, I said,

181
00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:34.260
do you think that I believe what I believe as much as you believe what you

182
00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:38.460
believe in great question. And without pausing with no hesitation, he said no.

183
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.300
And I thought, and then, yeah, and this is a really willing,

184
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:45.450
this is a really rare moment for me. It, then it then really escalated.

185
00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:48.540
And I've never done this before. I swear to you. I've never done this before.

186
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.640
I've never done this before I threw money down. I paid for the whole thing,

187
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:54.930
the whole tab right there. And I walked out.

188
00:09:54.931 --> 00:09:56.460
I've never done anything like that before.

189
00:09:56.461 --> 00:09:58.770
And it's so counter to write everything you know about me,

190
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.140
but I thought that moment right there,

191
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:05.340
like you have to sit in that now the like I'm not attacking your motives,

192
00:10:05.341 --> 00:10:09.840
but you actually believe that. I can't believe what I proport.

193
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.020
<v 0>What's amazing is there is a continuum and there's lots of people who would</v>

194
00:10:15.021 --> 00:10:18.710
blurt that out. And as soon as they heard themselves say it, they'd be like,

195
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.100
Whoa, Whoa. Oh, okay. I've gone down the wrong path.

196
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.610
<v 2>If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics,</v>
