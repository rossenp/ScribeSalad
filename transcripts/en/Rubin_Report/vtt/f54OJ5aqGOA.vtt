1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.240
<v 0>So I liken it to, um, seeing a parent with a toddler.</v>

2
00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:06.150
Like if you're at a restaurant and the toddler is freaking out and screaming,

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.090
and there are the parents that give a toddler what he wants and that's like

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.420
terrible and white America. When we,

5
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.630
when they see these radicalized black people, cause it's not all black people,

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.470
but they get the attention, right? These radicalized black people screaming,

7
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.350
Welly about something, they just give them what they want. No matter what it is,

8
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:24.660
defund the police. Okay. We'll just start talking about,

9
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:27.180
to find the police because you've made that ridiculous,

10
00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:31.170
absurd demand that has never been made ever. Um, and so I,

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.250
it's hard not to think that this is actually the fault of white guilt, right?

12
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.930
This is, this is white guilt gone too far.

13
00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:40.800
You guys are like overdosing on white guilt right now.

14
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.500
<v 1>All right.</v>

15
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.250
<v 2>Let's talk about the other thing enough about COVID, uh, racism, Candace.</v>

16
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.540
It's everywhere. There's more of it to go around than ever before.

17
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.620
It's a miracle that they even let you use Skype right now as a black woman.

18
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.270
I mean, what do we do about this situation?

19
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.840
<v 0>I mean, I think it is really time.</v>

20
00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:08.630
The challenge now is to just dear white people,

21
00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:11.510
what the hell have you been thinking, allowing this to go on

22
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.090
this far? You know what I mean at this tail in between the legs, Hey look,

23
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.140
my ancestors,

24
00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:22.250
I can at least say we were dragged with chains and whipped and beaten into

25
00:01:22.251 --> 00:01:25.820
submission white people today. I don't even know what this is. This is crazy.

26
00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:30.050
I mean, I've never seen such people, um, that are just so willing, uh,

27
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.410
to, to fight for their own oppression, right? To say, Oh,

28
00:01:33.411 --> 00:01:35.270
I shouldn't deserve it. I should stepped down from my job.

29
00:01:35.271 --> 00:01:37.310
I shouldn't be in this room. I shouldn't be able to say anything.

30
00:01:37.311 --> 00:01:40.440
I should be silent for a day. And it is just such a,

31
00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:44.240
such an openly hostile okay. Society. Um,

32
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.970
in terms of treating white people poorly. And,

33
00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:50.210
but white people had dug the grapes. So it's very bizarre to me. And, you know,

34
00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:53.330
I liken it to, um, seeing a parent with a toddler,

35
00:01:53.331 --> 00:01:56.240
like if you're at a restaurant and the toddler freaking out and screaming,

36
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.210
and there are the parents that give the toddler what he wants and that's like

37
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.540
terrible and white America. When we,

38
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.750
when they see these radicalized black people, cause it's not all black people,

39
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.620
but they get the attention, right? These radicalized black people screaming,

40
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.470
Welly about something, they just give them what they want, no matter what it is,

41
00:02:12.471 --> 00:02:14.780
defund the police. Okay. We'll just start talking about,

42
00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:17.300
to find the police because you've made that ridiculous,

43
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:21.240
absurd demand that has never been made ever. Um, and so I,

44
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.370
it's hard not to think that this is actually the fault of white guilt, right?

45
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.050
This is, this is white guilt gone too far.

46
00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:31.700
You guys are like overdosing on white guilt right now. Um.

47
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.050
<v 2>Hey, not me lady. I'm not guilty for anything. I haven't done me personally,</v>

48
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.913
but you know.

49
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.680
<v 0>And so, um, I always just ask,</v>

50
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.340
please stop giving the toddlers in the black community, what they want.

51
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.630
And similarly, I won't give your, you know, freakish little Antifa, white thugs,

52
00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:49.640
what they want, you know? And, um,

53
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.490
and there just needs to be more people having a bit of a spine, I would say,

54
00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:53.330
in the white community.

55
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.580
<v 2>Did you sense that this thing was coming sort of like what we were</v>

56
00:02:58.581 --> 00:03:02.830
always against when we would do college events together and it would be this odd

57
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:06.790
sort of Antifa thing, but we didn't know exactly what it was.

58
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.200
And it was a little bit before BLM had like fully exposed itself to be,

59
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:14.200
but all of this. And as I said to you in our other interview,

60
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:17.140
and as we've always done it, every event we've ever done together,

61
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:20.500
we take questions from people who disagree with us first,

62
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.490
but are you shocked how quickly in the last six months,

63
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.570
this thing like molded together and BLM and

64
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.290
Antifa and the Marxists and the Twitter,

65
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.400
like the whole thing just morphed into one really evil monster,

66
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.570
really freaking fast, all sort of under the COVID thing.

67
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:41.860
Like it all happened at the same time.

68
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.320
<v 0>Right? Um, I wasn't shocked. I mean, I had been warning about this for years.</v>

69
00:03:46.321 --> 00:03:47.820
I kept saying during an election cycle,

70
00:03:47.821 --> 00:03:51.840
you're going to see race issues drummed up now how violent they'd gotten. Yes.

71
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.090
That surprised me. Um, and uh,

72
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.540
also I would say I've been shocked by the permission they'd been given and the

73
00:03:57.541 --> 00:04:00.690
excuses in the past as they've been given, uh, by politicians.

74
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.520
I never saw that coming. I, I would think a store gets robbed looted, uh,

75
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.760
torn down, burned, and you know, no matter whether you're left or right,

76
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.100
you know, you would stand up and say, this is wrong.

77
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.490
The inability for politicians to now acknowledge what's right. And what's wrong.

78
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.450
That has shocked me. Uh, we, we put a real low point when, um,

79
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.480
people are saying, this is okay when politicians don't have the spine and say,

80
00:04:21.481 --> 00:04:22.620
you know what, I'm actually not okay.

81
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.520
It's been in the police and we need to isolate this incident in compromised

82
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.240
incident and not say that every police officer is wrong. Um, and so I,

83
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:35.820
I am shocked at how much the left hates America, um,

84
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.120
and how much the left hates people that do the right thing,

85
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.760
because that's really, what's come down to it with you do the right thing.

86
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.140
If you earn accolades in life, if you climb the ladder in life, they hate you.

87
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.330
And they're saying, there's not a place for you anymore.

88
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.060
There's something fundamentally wrong with free market capitalism,

89
00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:55.410
with everything that American and Western ideals in Western principles were

90
00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:59.640
built upon. So that part shocked me, but not this narrative.

91
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.110
I was seeing it everywhere I went and I knew that they were organized.

92
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.540
They were well-funded and that they were going to come ready to fight. Yeah.

93
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.400
<v 2>Do you, how do you see any chance of getting out of this thing? I mean,</v>

94
00:05:11.401 --> 00:05:13.650
as you said, you expect Trump to win.

95
00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:15.360
I think you would think he's going to win big.

96
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.300
I think he's probably going to win big too. And it's like,

97
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.860
no matter if Biden wins, if Trump wins, if Biden wins big, if Trump wins big,

98
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.980
it's sort of like, I don't see a way we get out of this either way.

99
00:05:25.981 --> 00:05:30.900
I could see some version maybe where if Trump wins by truly a

100
00:05:30.901 --> 00:05:32.130
landslide, like, uh,

101
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.720
like a Reagan re-election situation that maybe finally the

102
00:05:36.721 --> 00:05:41.430
last few decent Democrats get the kids out of the adult table,

103
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.340
like the kids that they've let taken over that sort of what you were saying

104
00:05:44.341 --> 00:05:47.610
before, maybe they do it themselves. Um,

105
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.280
but that doesn't seem very probable to me.

106
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.350
Do you see any way we get out of this thing?

107
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.890
<v 0>Well, the only way we get out of it is if people,</v>

108
00:05:55.891 --> 00:05:57.620
and I think we are actually going to,

109
00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.630
starting to get out of it now in a weird way,

110
00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:02.600
because people are starting to see socialism manifest, right?

111
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:04.070
Marxist principles manifest.

112
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.490
So looking around their neighborhoods and they're seeing, you know, uh,

113
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.160
stores being looted stores, being robbed violence, happening,

114
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.230
police getting shot, individual, uh,

115
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:17.120
cities that are gone up in crime by something like 267%, right.

116
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.430
In New York city and in Chicago. Um,

117
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.860
and they're seeing that the suburbs are now being threatened.

118
00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:22.790
They're gonna come to the suburbs.

119
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.610
They're telling people in the suburbs to leave their house. You saw,

120
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.760
I'm sure the video clip of maybe you didn't because you were away, but, uh,

121
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.030
throughout DC, they were going up to white people at restaurants and

122
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.260
saying, put your fist up and say, you know,

123
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:38.150
black power or else you get screamed at.

124
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.180
So these people are now seeing you've supported this,

125
00:06:41.181 --> 00:06:42.650
and now you've seen what it's become.

126
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.790
And I think that once those people understand now not once they see that

127
00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:50.390
manifest they'll change their perspective and they'll they'll vote differently.

128
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.210
Right. And then of course, once the Democrats,

129
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.880
if the Democrats lose a ton of seats, it no longer serves them to,

130
00:06:56.881 --> 00:06:59.090
to be funding these Marxism who's no longer serves.

131
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:02.780
And to stand behind the violent criminals, it no longer serves them, uh,

132
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.710
to pretend that these criminals were righteous and you'll see a dramatic change

133
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.920
in society. And I think that it will secure as it did in England.

134
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.180
And I'm hoping to see what we saw in England where after Brexit, it just, every,

135
00:07:14.181 --> 00:07:16.700
every vote went to the Tory party. Um,

136
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.090
I think that we will see the same thing in America and we'll save this country

137
00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:22.850
for a lot of time to come because people will not forget this.

138
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.960
<v 2>Yeah. I, I, since you're kind of right. You know,</v>

139
00:07:25.961 --> 00:07:29.020
I hate when they say the gay community, the black community,

140
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.600
that community thing, I hate that. But, you know,

141
00:07:31.601 --> 00:07:34.840
I saw this poll just since I've been back that at one point, I guess,

142
00:07:34.841 --> 00:07:36.730
post the convention,

143
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.620
24% of black people were thinking about voting for Trump. Historically,

144
00:07:41.621 --> 00:07:43.720
we're looking at like 4%, you know,

145
00:07:43.721 --> 00:07:47.110
I tweeted something like a year ago that I thought Trump was going to get 30% of

146
00:07:47.111 --> 00:07:51.130
the black vote. And I know that might be a little crazy, but I still,

147
00:07:51.131 --> 00:07:56.080
I think that the mask has been pulled off and I think something crazy

148
00:07:56.081 --> 00:07:59.350
is going to happen. I really do. Are you with me on that.

149
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.580
<v 0>A hundred percent? You know, I've been saying this forever and I was laughed at,</v>

150
00:08:03.581 --> 00:08:05.520
in the beginning, right. When I first said black said,

151
00:08:05.521 --> 00:08:09.520
and I said that my vision had always been 20 points by 2020.

152
00:08:09.521 --> 00:08:12.700
I knew it was possible because the left can no longer hide from itself.

153
00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:17.050
And I was so happy when AOC hit the map, uh, because she was just saying it,

154
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.470
you know what I mean? The old school Democrats with it hiding what they wanted.

155
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.730
And then AOC kind of took over their party and said, no, this is what we want.

156
00:08:24.731 --> 00:08:28.060
And they capitulated to what she was saying. And so they couldn't lie anymore.

157
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.610
Right? They couldn't lie about the fact that they were supporting these Marxist

158
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.150
principles and the destruction of family black lives matter on the website,

159
00:08:34.151 --> 00:08:37.570
