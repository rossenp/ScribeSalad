WEBVTT

1
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.900
<v 1>Everybody. It is a bonus Friday show. You know,</v>

2
00:00:11.901 --> 00:00:14.960
we do our direct messages, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, yesterday.

3
00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:18.080
We did two shows cause we also did a debate recap,

4
00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:21.560
which about 400,000 of you guys watched.

5
00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:26.390
You watched me drink tequila and kick my dog under the table. Uh,

6
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.850
MSNBC would be thrilled to have those kinds of numbers.

7
00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:31.280
So thank you guys for watching everything we're doing here.

8
00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:32.630
A lot of good stuff is happening.

9
00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:36.950
And I think we've carved out a little space for sane people who want a little

10
00:00:36.951 --> 00:00:40.340
bit of nuance in their news and who don't want to be hysterical, nut bags.

11
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.510
So you're amongst the lucky few that see the world that way. Are we lucky?

12
00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:47.420
I'm not actually sure about that. It might be ignorance is bliss, you know,

13
00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:51.200
so it might be a little more of a headache, but alas, here we are. Anyway,

14
00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:55.520
today we are doing an ask me anything and all of the questions that I am

15
00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:57.650
sourcing here. And I got a couple dozen of them.

16
00:00:57.651 --> 00:01:00.680
I'm going to get to as many as possible. Uh,

17
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.950
all of the questions are sourced from Rubin report.com.

18
00:01:03.951 --> 00:01:07.310
That is our locals community. And I know a whole bunch of you have joined our,

19
00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:10.130
our numbers are blowing up over there and I'm able to communicate with you guys

20
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:13.010
directly over there. So you can check it out on the

21
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.720
desktop@rubinreport.com or you can download our iOS or Google play app,

22
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.440
just search Rubin report and either of those stores and, uh,

23
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.370
or you can download the locals app and stuff there there's stuff out there on

24
00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:27.230
the internet that, you know, you can put things on your phone.

25
00:01:27.231 --> 00:01:29.710
It's incredible stuff. All right. So let's just jump right into it. There's,

26
00:01:29.711 --> 00:01:33.380
there's a ton of great questions. Obviously most of them are politically based.

27
00:01:33.381 --> 00:01:35.840
I said to the people, you can ask me anything,

28
00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:40.610
I'd be happy to talk about sports or video games or sneakers

29
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.640
or painting or music or anything.

30
00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:45.260
Maybe I'll add a couple of my own questions in,

31
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.850
cause I got mostly political questions,

32
00:01:46.851 --> 00:01:48.650
but they're actually really great questions and it's,

33
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.840
and it's a pretty diverse set of thoughts. Uh,

34
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:53.960
so I'll start with the McRib who says, uh,

35
00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:58.460
what do you think about a Haley Crenshaw ticket in 2024? Well, let me be very,

36
00:01:58.461 --> 00:02:00.230
very, very, very clear about that.

37
00:02:00.231 --> 00:02:03.080
I would vote for a Hailey Crenshaw ticket in a second,

38
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.940
like in an absolute millisecond. I would vote for that ticket. And by the way,

39
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:10.790
I, I truly believe this that, uh,

40
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.810
let's assume for a second that Trump wins and there's some questions later on

41
00:02:14.811 --> 00:02:17.720
about whether, what happens if he wins and what happens if he loses,

42
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.490
if Trump wins and we have four more years of the

43
00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:25.280
destruction of sort of the democratic party.

44
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.970
And finally we're able to get critical race theory out of politics and social

45
00:02:28.971 --> 00:02:31.220
justice really takes a hit. And,

46
00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:35.930
and you see that the sort of Zeit Geist is moving

47
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:40.010
towards sort of more freedom and enough of the political correctness and all

48
00:02:40.011 --> 00:02:43.040
that. I think after eight years of Trump,

49
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.270
Trump and the sort of manga movement, the thing behind Trump,

50
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.440
that was the great wrecking ball. I don't think that will be necessary anymore.

51
00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:55.640
And then what I think will happen is that you will get a truly

52
00:02:55.641 --> 00:03:00.250
diverse set of Republican candidates like seen before and by

53
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:01.084
diverse,

54
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.810
I mean the stupid immutable characteristics stuff that the left loves and that

55
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.890
it'll be, it'll be black and white and Latino and gay and female and blah, blah,

56
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.390
blah, blah, blah.

57
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.960
Maybe we can get one person to hold all of those things at once. Um,

58
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.480
who would be the, that would be the best democratic candidate ever.

59
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.610
You give them a lazy eye and Olympian. It's like, you got,

60
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.640
you got 20 years of running the country. Um,

61
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.730
but I really think that after eight years of Trump, the wrecking ball,

62
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:29.530
that there will be a reset that all of the reasons that you guys watch this,

63
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:34.510
or you watch Ben Shapiro or any of the sort of new voices Crowder like

64
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.250
the younger right leaning thing that is diverse in its set of ideas,

65
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.510
that will be what comes after Trump. Now, if Trump loses,

66
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.410
then I think it's completely, I don't know what happens to the Republicans.

67
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.430
If Trump loses,

68
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:52.480
I could see the Republicans either just going back to the generic Romney

69
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:56.560
Republicans who sort of sound middle of the road. So they lose all the time.

70
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.170
Or I could see actually the much scarier thing,

71
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:02.200
which is we could start growing a genuine far right in the country.

72
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.450
And that's why calling Trump far,

73
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:08.320
right this whole time and a white supremacist and a neo-Nazi was so bad because

74
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:10.420
he's not, as he said in the debate last night,

75
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:12.340
he doesn't care about any of that stuff. He likes,

76
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.690
he likes success and he wants people to be successful. That's what I believe.

77
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.200
Um, and, and if he was to lose,

78
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:22.720
you could see some really bad elements being like, well,

79
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.100
even Trump couldn't do it.

80
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.360
So now let's just go all in and get a real sort of far right party here in

81
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:32.770
America like they have in Europe. So I, I think the best way forward, if you,

82
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.140
if you care about plurality of opinion, if you,

83
00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:39.130
if you care about freedom at any level and Liberty and the rest of it is that

84
00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:39.964
Trump wins.

85
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.900
And then after Trump and I actually think he would be pretty good at passing the

86
00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:46.780
Baton. He, you know, that's what the apprentice was, right?

87
00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:49.810
Like that's what it was all about. The show, the apprentice, which by the way,

88
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.800
well, before Trump was running for office, I never watched any reality shows.

89
00:04:53.801 --> 00:04:56.980
I did not watch any reality shows. I never watched, uh,

90
00:04:56.981 --> 00:05:00.880
the Ozzy Osborne thing or who wants to be a millionaire.

91
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:03.550
I don't watch any of that stuff or the Jersey shore,

92
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.080
but I watched celebrity apprentice.

93
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.180
I don't know why there was something about it.

94
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:09.760
I think he'd be pretty good at passing the Baton and going, Oh,

95
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.930
now we can have a crop of Republicans that are,

96
00:05:13.931 --> 00:05:18.340
that don't have to be sort of so bombastic that don't have to fight the system

97
00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:22.600
as much. We did it for eight years and now we can hand it off to people who are,

98
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.580
who are really well-versed in the constitution and our laws

99
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.300
who have incredibly interesting rich, diverse backgrounds like Nikki Haley,

100
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.080
like Dan Crenshaw. And I think, I think that would be, would be pretty sweet.

101
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.650
Um, storm says, how do you,

102
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.270
how does the average person balance being well-informed versus staying sane?

103
00:05:43.271 --> 00:05:45.580
Man, that's the million dollar question, right? I mean,

104
00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:46.950
I write a little bit about this in,

105
00:05:46.951 --> 00:05:51.790
in chapter 10 of don't burn this book of sort of how to say how to stay sane in

106
00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:55.990
this information war or in this reality war as I've been putting it.

107
00:05:55.991 --> 00:05:59.780
Because as I said last, you know, we've got the political battle,

108
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.100
we've got the cultural battle, but really they sit within the reality war,

109
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.610
which is that everyone's catering information to themselves and you can't have a

110
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:11.540
political battle or a cultural battle with when everybody has a different set of

111
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:14.390
information. So staying sane in this thing is really hard.

112
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.190
There are a lot of people.

113
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:20.840
I know people very well that I'm very close to that are really struggling with

114
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:24.140
this. Uh, I struggle with it to some degree, like I have,

115
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.450
I try to tell you guys what I think to the best of my ability and I try to do it

116
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:32.360
in a, in an honest and truthful way. Um,

117
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.350
but is it possible that sometimes I'm misinformed about something? Sure.

118
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:39.350
It's possible. It could, uh, could a story be changing as I'm talking about it.

119
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:40.820
Sure. That could be happening. Uh,

120
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.760
could some of my biases leak into some of this stuff. Yeah. And I, by the way,

121
00:06:43.761 --> 00:06:46.370
I try to be honest about that and I'm not sitting here pretending that I don't

122
00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:49.310
have biases, but as to your question of being sane,

123
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.660
I would say there are a few things you could do. Um, you know,

124
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:57.590
two of the things we do just involve bedroom. We have no TV in our bedroom.

125
00:06:57.591 --> 00:06:59.150
I believe the bedroom is for two things.

126
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.790
You can probably figure out what those things are. Uh,

127
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.180
we have no TV and I don't bring my phone into the bedroom. You know,

128
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:09.080
the idea that you can, uh, have the last thing that you look at at night,

129
00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:11.960
be that black mirror and see all the chaos. And then you go to bed.

130
00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:15.890
Like your brain is still there. It's still running like an endless speed.

131
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:16.521
And the,

132
00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:19.340
and that you might wake up in the middle of the night and look at it or in the

133
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:22.820
morning, the first thing you do, I can open up Twitter and see a pink enemy,

134
00:07:22.821 --> 00:07:27.140
genderless, avatar, tell me, you know, that I'm a or something. Like, it's just,

135
00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:28.310
it's just not necessary.

136
00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:32.450
So I think there are little things you can do in your life to disconnect, um,

137
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.220
including those types of things. And then, you know,

138
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:35.960
like there's some generic stuff that I could tell you,

139
00:07:35.961 --> 00:07:37.760
like a little bit of exercise,

140
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.480
like find some stuff that you really love watching. I,

141
00:07:40.481 --> 00:07:43.880
I keep joking with everyone around here and my staff that, uh,

142
00:07:43.881 --> 00:07:46.910
when I'm doing cardio, we have a Roku on that TV.

143
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.000
And if you were to look at my YouTube search history, it's like,

144
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.540
I got old episodes of the transformers. I got old basketball games.

145
00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:56.480
I got old GI Joes. I got, uh,

146
00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.980
I watch a lot of like old Frankie Valli concerts and Tina Turner concerts.

147
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.310
And I watched some old WWE wrestling. And it's like,

148
00:08:04.311 --> 00:08:08.420
basically I'm doing things that I probably would have done back in 1987,

149
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:11.050
but do some things that you enjoy that, that aren't political.

150
00:08:11.051 --> 00:08:14.500
I would say that that's a pretty good one. Uh, Oh, this next question.

151
00:08:14.501 --> 00:08:19.150
We're going to throw to some video because Simon tech asks a really good

152
00:08:19.151 --> 00:08:20.850
question here. And,

153
00:08:20.851 --> 00:08:25.180
and I think when I talk about the reality war of how things happen,

154
00:08:25.181 --> 00:08:27.040
and then if you just see them, you would acknowledge it.

155
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.170
But if you don't see it, or if the media is hiding it from you,

156
00:08:29.171 --> 00:08:31.630
then you're living in a different reality. Well, this is a great question.

157
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:35.170
He says, other than masks does Biden actually have plan.

158
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:38.770
Cause Trump lists all sorts of companies involved in everything going on and

159
00:08:38.771 --> 00:08:40.810
Biden complaints that Trump isn't doing enough.

160
00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:43.510
And that masks will set you free. Okay.

161
00:08:43.511 --> 00:08:48.310
Before I say anything here we are now going to throw to a video.

162
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.380
This is a Fowchee, Dr. Fowchee, right? Trust the scientists. We love Fowchee.

163
00:08:53.381 --> 00:08:57.450
Fowchee hates Trump. Trump hates, this is Fowchee.

164
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.610
This is March 8th of this year.

165
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.570
<v 2>Right now in the United States. People should not be walking around with masks.</v>

166
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:10.130
You're sure of it because people are listening really closely to this right now.

167
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:13.130
People should not be walked. There's no reason to be walking around with a mask.

168
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.930
When you're in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask,

169
00:09:17.931 --> 00:09:22.610
might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block, uh,

170
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:23.660
a droplet,

171
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.520
but it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is.

172
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.420
And often there are unintended consequences.

173
00:09:32.421 --> 00:09:35.540
People keep fiddling with the mask and they keep touching their face.

174
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.510
<v 1>Well, hot diggity, dog, Fowchee.</v>

175
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:42.320
People should not be walking around wearing masks. Right?

176
00:09:42.321 --> 00:09:45.470
What else did he say in there? There's no reason to be walking around,

177
00:09:45.471 --> 00:09:50.300
wearing a mask. A mask is just a drop in the bucket, right?

178
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:54.490
You see what's going on here. People, these guys all change things. The,

179
00:09:54.491 --> 00:09:57.950
the who, the CDC over months change things.

180
00:09:57.951 --> 00:10:02.780
When the lockdowns were sold on us, what were we told flatten the curve 15 days.

181
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.280
We're now eight months in.

182
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:08.390
I remember and find the videos of me saying it back in may,

183
00:10:08.391 --> 00:10:11.690
back in June when they were saying, Oh, we're going to in California,

184
00:10:11.691 --> 00:10:14.180
we're going to lock you down until August 1st. And I remember saying, well,

185
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.100
why the hell would we believe you? Of course,

186
00:10:16.101 --> 00:10:19.910
it's going to go on longer than that. Where are we now? End of October,

187
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.010
it's almost November people. This,

188
00:10:22.011 --> 00:10:24.590
this has almost nothing to do with the virus anymore.

189
00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:28.430
That is not to diminish the fact that some people get sick and older people can

190
00:10:28.431 --> 00:10:32.510
die, but the vast majority of people survive. This thing,

191
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.170
I believe you as an individual person should do whatever you think is right.

192
00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:39.050
And you should instruct your family and friends accordingly,

193
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.160
but destroying everything, destroying the deli near my house,

194
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.210
having me wear a mask. When, when no one's in any of the stores that I go to,

195
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.950
or any of these things, it's AB salute nonsense. I said it last night,

196
00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:55.130
but I got my teeth cleaned yesterday and I'm sitting at the dentist's office.

197
00:10:55.131 --> 00:10:57.510
I have to put on a mask to be in the garage. And then I put in,

198
00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.660
I'm wearing the mask. I'm in the elevator. I'm down in the hallway.

199
00:10:59.661 --> 00:11:02.990
I don't see another human being. I get into the office. They've got masks,

200
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:07.310
they've got glass plexiglass in front of them. I sit in the chair,

201
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.180
I take my mask off. The woman tells me to put the mask back on while,

202
00:11:11.181 --> 00:11:13.190
while I'm literally alone in the room. And by the way,

203
00:11:13.191 --> 00:11:15.200
I was getting my teeth cleaned. You know what they do with that?

204
00:11:15.201 --> 00:11:19.760
That's when you have to open your mouth and they, I R I, yeah. So it's like,

205
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:24.140
none of this makes any sense. But if you think that, as Biden said,

206
00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:25.850
we're going to, it's going to be a federal mandate.

207
00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:26.900
We'll keep the lockdowns going. Like,

208
00:11:26.901 --> 00:11:31.430
if you want to live in your basement forever. And I think Joe kind of does,

209
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.500
if you want to live in your basement forever, then,

210
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:37.280
then follow what these people want. But if you want to risk it, if you wanna,

211
00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:41.380
if you think life is about risk and chance and reward and,

212
00:11:41.381 --> 00:11:44.090
and that you have to make decisions for yourself. I mean,

213
00:11:44.091 --> 00:11:45.290
just think about the average.

214
00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.700
Think about someone who's put their whole life into a small business,

215
00:11:49.701 --> 00:11:51.920
a little restaurant, a little shop,

216
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:55.540
whatever it might be that their life is destroyed right now.

217
00:11:55.570 --> 00:12:00.010
And is their life really think about it is their life destroyed by the virus or

218
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:02.380
the government. And the answer is the government.

219
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:06.070
Every buddy that runs a store should be able to make a decision that they want.

220
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.220
And if you want to have people check their temperature when they walk in,

221
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.470
then so be it. But th this is we have,

222
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:16.080
we have crossed the Rubicon into crazy town people. Uh,

223
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.450
okay. Uh, this is THX. He says,

224
00:12:18.451 --> 00:12:21.930
should Trump have asked Biden how we afford his multiple homes being a public

225
00:12:21.931 --> 00:12:24.690
servant for the past 47 years. So, you know,

226
00:12:24.691 --> 00:12:28.320
what's interesting about this is they sort of did it and go in that direction,

227
00:12:28.321 --> 00:12:30.960
right? I mean, Trump, for a good 10,

228
00:12:30.961 --> 00:12:33.840
12 minutes of this was pushing on the Ukraine stuff on the China stuff.

229
00:12:33.841 --> 00:12:37.350
How did Hunter Biden make this money? He's unqualified to do this. You know,

230
00:12:37.351 --> 00:12:40.680
you, are you, what was it, big daddy or you, or you Papa? What,

231
00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.900
what was the phrase he was using providing, are you the big man,

232
00:12:42.901 --> 00:12:45.900
something like that, uh, meaning that, are you getting the kickbacks?

233
00:12:45.901 --> 00:12:48.270
Like this is a mafia operation, right? You watched the,

234
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.640
and it was like the captains make a certain amount of money.

235
00:12:50.641 --> 00:12:55.320
They got to send it over to send their cut over to over to Tony in the,

236
00:12:55.321 --> 00:12:58.470
in the non-descript, uh, white envelope. Um,

237
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.500
so he didn't outright say that, although I think was it,

238
00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.950
was it yesterday or maybe even the day before he said something about Biden's

239
00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:06.960
big house and Biden does have a big house. I mean,

240
00:13:06.961 --> 00:13:10.590
this is a few of you asked questions that were kind of similar to this.

241
00:13:10.591 --> 00:13:15.540
This is where I would say, uh, you know, Maxine waters, who is a, uh,

242
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:19.770
democratic Congresswoman here in Los Angeles for South central LA,

243
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.710
which is a seriously depressed economic place with a lot of crime.

244
00:13:22.711 --> 00:13:25.740
A lot of drug use all of that stuff, primarily a black neighborhood.

245
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.050
That's the district she's represented.

246
00:13:28.051 --> 00:13:30.990
I think she's been in government for about 44 years. Um,

247
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:35.400
she lives in Hancock park in a $6 million mansion. Hancock park, uh,

248
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:40.410
is super expensive, super elite, uh, sort of adjacent to two Beverly Hills.

249
00:13:40.411 --> 00:13:44.130
And she's got a $6 million mansion. She's been in government for 44 years.

250
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.110
I'm not saying she did illegal things.

251
00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.680
I'm not even necessarily saying she did a moral things, but it,

252
00:13:49.681 --> 00:13:53.940
it doesn't surprise me when these government people do this. Right. Of course,

253
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:56.760
they're going to use all of their power, like messy,

254
00:13:56.761 --> 00:13:58.890
dirty game it's game of Thrones.

255
00:13:58.891 --> 00:14:00.690
And what do I always tell you guys about game of Thrones,

256
00:14:00.691 --> 00:14:04.410
last episode of game of Thrones stop, right? Jumped 20 seconds. If you,

257
00:14:04.411 --> 00:14:07.950
if you haven't seen it yet, but the last, the last scene in game of Thrones,

258
00:14:07.951 --> 00:14:11.430
it's like five guys sitting around a table and they're all drinking,

259
00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:16.020
but everyone they know is dead, right? Like it's a messy game of power.

260
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.770
And that's what politics is. So I expect corrupt people to be in this it's,

261
00:14:19.771 --> 00:14:23.520
it's a, it's a corrupt system. Power is going to corrupt.

262
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.440
That doesn't mean they're all equally corrupt.

263
00:14:25.441 --> 00:14:29.280
And I would always vote for somebody that would give me a little bit more

264
00:14:29.281 --> 00:14:33.000
freedom, not take away as much stuff from me, not promise me everything.

265
00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.640
You know, that, that's the thing. Once you see through the,

266
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.370
the lies of the left, it's like, Y you know,

267
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.120
you're putting in people who are just promising to fix your life.

268
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:45.540
We're going to give you all of this stuff. Like, yeah, Joe. Yeah. Joe Biden.

269
00:14:45.541 --> 00:14:48.030
Okay. You didn't do anything. I think for 47 years you were VP.

270
00:14:48.031 --> 00:14:50.940
You were Senator like all of these great ideas that you have.

271
00:14:50.941 --> 00:14:52.850
You just didn't get to them all of these years.

272
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.990
You're either totally inept or you're just a liar. I mean, that,

273
00:14:56.991 --> 00:14:58.220
that just is it,

274
00:14:58.221 --> 00:15:02.420
I actually thought Trump's best moment last night was I ran because of you.

275
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.740
I ran because of you. And that actually is true.

276
00:15:06.741 --> 00:15:09.020
Like if the system wasn't, so corroded,

277
00:15:09.021 --> 00:15:12.110
Trump would have never run and the systems corroded and enough people saw it.

278
00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:15.700
So enough people voted for orange man. Uh, well,

279
00:15:15.701 --> 00:15:18.040
that gets me to the next question from burned, which is, do you,

280
00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:20.830
do you really believe almost all politicians are corrupt?

281
00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.470
Let's say on a national level, I would just add one thing, which is,

282
00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.350
I don't think they're all. Oh, I sort of said this already.

283
00:15:26.351 --> 00:15:29.380
I don't think they're all equally corrupt. And I think there are good ones.

284
00:15:29.381 --> 00:15:31.390
People. I think Nikki Haley is a good person.

285
00:15:31.391 --> 00:15:35.470
I think that Dan Crenshaw is a good person. I think the Tulsi Gabard a Democrat.

286
00:15:35.471 --> 00:15:38.800
I don't know for how much longer. I think she is a good person. Um,

287
00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:42.640
I think that the system sort of corrupts you, it, and it makes you,

288
00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:45.550
and also politics is, is a system of like, you know,

289
00:15:45.551 --> 00:15:49.570
constant different pressures to get things done and having to negotiate with

290
00:15:49.571 --> 00:15:51.970
people you don't like and the rest of it. And in many ways,

291
00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.240
politicians have all sort of backed away from the negotiating with people you

292
00:15:55.241 --> 00:15:57.040
don't like now you just talk to your own team.

293
00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:01.870
So it creates a situation that I think good people probably

294
00:16:01.871 --> 00:16:04.390
become less good. And people say to me all the time, Dave,

295
00:16:04.391 --> 00:16:06.520
why don't you run for something run for mayor of Los Angeles,

296
00:16:06.521 --> 00:16:10.360
run for governor of California. And it's like, I don't think,

297
00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:14.080
I don't think I could make all of those compromises,

298
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.120
although I can tell you this. If I ever ran for anything,

299
00:16:16.121 --> 00:16:18.580
my plan would be simple. I can't fix your life.

300
00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.610
I want you to have as much money as possible. We're cutting all the budgets.

301
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:25.360
And, uh, you know, we'll have a form letter on my website,

302
00:16:25.361 --> 00:16:28.540
but I'm not going to read it. Like, that's it. That's what I would run on. Um,

303
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.230
I have nothing to do with your life. I don't like you. I don't want to know you.

304
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.820
Good luck you get out of my face. Okay. Um, well,

305
00:16:36.821 --> 00:16:39.610
this is another sort of offshoot of that. Uh, this is from Emmy who says,

306
00:16:39.611 --> 00:16:42.310
how do we convince Rick Grinnell to run for POTUS?

307
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.430
Is he bribed bubble with baked goods? To your knowledge?

308
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.820
I've had Rick over for a couple, couple of dinner parties.

309
00:16:48.821 --> 00:16:52.900
I'm trying to think on his baked good situation. I believe he's a dessert eater,

310
00:16:52.901 --> 00:16:56.470
but we usually do like some kind of ice cream situation. Um, Rick Grinnell,

311
00:16:56.471 --> 00:17:00.400
for those of you who don't know, he's been on the show several times, he is, uh,

312
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.280
he worked for several presidents, uh,

313
00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:06.670
as he was like national security advisor and worked for, uh, re uh,

314
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.650
John Bolton at the UN.

315
00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:13.570
He then was our ambassador to Germany under the Trump administration as

316
00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:15.340
administration. Then for about a month and a half,

317
00:17:15.341 --> 00:17:19.780
he was the acting director of national intelligence. Now it's Ratcliffe. Uh,

318
00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.850
it's not, it's not Rick anymore. Uh,

319
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.080
he's now out campaigning campaigning for Trump. Rick is a, is a really good guy.

320
00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.660
He happens to be gay, big whoop.

321
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:32.050
Now you would think that someone that is attained the level of success that he

322
00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:35.740
has and being openly gay and fighting for gay rights and being at the UN and

323
00:17:35.741 --> 00:17:39.040
fighting against all of the anti gay stuff in so many of these countries,

324
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.620
you think that, uh, you know, some of the,

325
00:17:41.621 --> 00:17:44.440
the game media or the lefty media would call him a good guy,

326
00:17:44.441 --> 00:17:48.310
but they constantly try to try to destroy him. Um, I know him,

327
00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.050
him and his Matt for years now, and they're good people will he run?

328
00:17:52.051 --> 00:17:54.420
I would love to. I tweeted out every now and again.

329
00:17:54.421 --> 00:17:56.700
I'm like Rick Grinnell run for governor of California.

330
00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.000
Please I've asked him privately. I don't know that it's going to happen, but,

331
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:04.140
but again, that, that goes to, if you're a decent person, why would you be,

332
00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:07.710
want to be part of the mess, but I'll give you the silver lining.

333
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.710
Cause I'm a silver lining guy. The silver lining is that again,

334
00:18:10.711 --> 00:18:14.280
after Trump breaks the thing, if he wins again and breaks the thing,

335
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:18.570
well then the machine that has crushed so many people and cancel culture and

336
00:18:18.571 --> 00:18:23.220
fear that will have dissipated in a way that new good people will be allowed to

337
00:18:23.221 --> 00:18:26.390
get in. I mean, I think we're seeing that with someone like Kim classic in,

338
00:18:26.391 --> 00:18:30.180
in Baltimore, like maybe some new interesting, good people will get in,

339
00:18:30.181 --> 00:18:34.580
but I still think there's a lot of fear around and it's warranted. Uh,

340
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:38.660
Falcon says, did you see anything strange about Joe's eyes last night?

341
00:18:38.661 --> 00:18:43.600
He looked like he was on meth, huge pupils that took the blue out of it. Uh,

342
00:18:43.601 --> 00:18:46.580
I'm going to go on the record here and say that I don't think Joe Biden was on

343
00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.880
Mac because I know that the losers that media matters watch all my videos.

344
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.550
And they're just waiting for me to say that Joe Biden was on meth.

345
00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.940
And now that I just said it in a sentence where I was saying it didn't happen,

346
00:18:55.941 --> 00:18:58.700
that's the sentence that they can clip that Joe Biden was on meth,

347
00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:02.270
but I'm not actually saying that, um, God,

348
00:19:02.271 --> 00:19:06.710
these people can you imagine it's your job to sit and watch videos of people you

349
00:19:06.711 --> 00:19:09.200
hate so you can try to destroy them. How are you doing guys? Good,

350
00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:13.370
good to see you. Um, so I don't think Joe Biden was on meth.

351
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.100
Do I think he was on something? I mean, look, they shut him down.

352
00:19:16.101 --> 00:19:19.100
They put a lid on the campaign on Monday. So on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

353
00:19:19.101 --> 00:19:21.500
Thursday until the debate, he was Mia.

354
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:23.810
So it was he sleeping that whole entire time. Like,

355
00:19:23.811 --> 00:19:26.450
are they pumping him full of Adderall or,

356
00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:31.340
or God knows what or crazy supplements or something does he in the two debates

357
00:19:31.341 --> 00:19:35.810
seem way more coherent than he does publicly? Yeah, he does.

358
00:19:35.811 --> 00:19:39.530
So I don't know what that's about. I don't know what he's writing down or,

359
00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:42.890
or has pre-written maybe or on the things in front of him. Like,

360
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:44.840
I don't know about any of that stuff. So again,

361
00:19:44.841 --> 00:19:49.700
that's just like kind of conspiracy stuff. Um, but he has seemed more, uh,

362
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.670
more coherent. However, there was a moment about an hour and you know,

363
00:19:52.671 --> 00:19:56.000
he looked at his watch at one point and then there was like two or three moments

364
00:19:56.001 --> 00:20:00.140
where he started stumbling and you could just see him, he could just get back,

365
00:20:00.141 --> 00:20:00.321
you know,

366
00:20:00.321 --> 00:20:03.230
the rollercoaster is going and he's like falling out and then he like kind of

367
00:20:03.231 --> 00:20:03.651
falls out,

368
00:20:03.651 --> 00:20:05.810
but then the roller coaster comes around and he gets back on and that's sort of

369
00:20:05.811 --> 00:20:09.890
the way his, his train of thought seems to work. Um, but he didn't,

370
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.690
he didn't falter. He didn't have like a major falter the ideas I don't like.

371
00:20:14.691 --> 00:20:15.800
And it's, it's kind of depressing.

372
00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.650
Cause once you see through the lies of the Democrats,

373
00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.280
then you just kind of see it everywhere and how it all is just like meaningless.

374
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.860
It's just all meaningless talk about how they can help you,

375
00:20:24.861 --> 00:20:27.260
even though they've never helped you before. Um,

376
00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:30.560
so I do not think Joe Biden was on meth. Is he on something like,

377
00:20:30.561 --> 00:20:33.590
are they giving him something possibly, could Trump be on something possibly?

378
00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.470
I mean, Trump, the amount of stuff that he knows that he can't, you know,

379
00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:38.600
all the companies that he's working with to do this,

380
00:20:38.601 --> 00:20:41.900
all of the numbers that he knows and what we did here and cut this and all that,

381
00:20:41.901 --> 00:20:46.460
like it's impressive. So like public hopped up on something. Yeah.

382
00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:51.150
Maybe. Um, Oh, I like this question. This is Travis. He says,

383
00:20:51.151 --> 00:20:52.200
do you think in the future,

384
00:20:52.201 --> 00:20:55.890
people will refer to Trump as a third-party candidate,

385
00:20:55.891 --> 00:21:00.180
who you SERP the GOP machine to make his run. That's really interesting.

386
00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:05.310
And I'll take a sip of coffee before I get to it. Um,

387
00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:09.510
the reason I think it's interesting is because it gets back to whether Trump

388
00:21:09.511 --> 00:21:13.860
wins the second term or not. If he loses the second term, if meaning,

389
00:21:13.861 --> 00:21:18.030
if he loses in a few weeks and the system that exists just sort of

390
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.570
recalibrate and is stronger again, right?

391
00:21:21.571 --> 00:21:25.590
The very thing Trump was running against. If it destroys Trump, that machinery,

392
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.340
whatever that is, will be way stronger than it was before Trump.

393
00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:33.450
That that's very scary to me. I think it's probably scary to you. Um, and I,

394
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:37.200
by the way, I know a lot of people, public people who privately support Trump,

395
00:21:37.201 --> 00:21:40.770
but they're not doing it because they're afraid if he loses that the system will

396
00:21:40.771 --> 00:21:44.160
destroy them. I mean, I just can't live that way. Maybe I'm an idiot.

397
00:21:44.161 --> 00:21:45.600
I don't know. Um,

398
00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:49.650
but I think if Trump loses then the Lincoln project

399
00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:53.670
people and whatever, the future of the marginalized,

400
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:57.240
basically democratic party that the Republican party will be this neutered,

401
00:21:57.241 --> 00:22:00.870
pathetic, um, flacid group of people,

402
00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:04.140
they will try to destroy any evidence that Trump ever existed,

403
00:22:04.141 --> 00:22:05.760
that anything good ever happened,

404
00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:09.150
that he got rid of regulation that he helped cause peace in the middle East.

405
00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:12.090
I just saw literally a minute before we started this, uh,

406
00:22:12.091 --> 00:22:15.960
that Sudan just signed a deal with Israel. So now there's the UAE,

407
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:19.920
Qatar and the S and Sudan on top of Egypt and Jordan,

408
00:22:19.921 --> 00:22:21.300
which did it obviously years ago.

409
00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.090
And now they're saying five more countries possibly in the next week,

410
00:22:24.091 --> 00:22:26.190
including Saudi Arabia. You know,

411
00:22:26.191 --> 00:22:30.600
what's funny about this was foreign policy mentioned once except for Russia and

412
00:22:30.601 --> 00:22:34.800
Ukraine and China was actual foreign policy named mentioned once in the debates.

413
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:38.260
The answer is no Trump needed to mention it last night. He needed to be like,

414
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.320
can we, can we just stop for just a sec? Uh,

415
00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:42.800
remember that piece in the middle East thing that everybody wanted? Hey,

416
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:47.730
we'll have. Yeah. So I think he, he did miss a little opportunity there,

417
00:22:47.731 --> 00:22:51.540
but I mean, if they get five more countries on board this week, I mean,

418
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.250
it's, it's monumental, isn't even the word. Um, but you know,

419
00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.750
already this morning I saw Chris Hayes on MSNBC, that little dork, uh,

420
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:04.470
who basically was like, Oh, you know, these are just like fake peace deals.

421
00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:07.590
You know, something to that effect like, Oh, this is Jared Kushner's thing.

422
00:23:07.591 --> 00:23:09.390
These, these nothing peace deals.

423
00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:11.340
There's nothing peace deals that nobody could do.

424
00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.170
I know nobody could do them for the last 60 years,

425
00:23:13.171 --> 00:23:16.860
but they're nothing now because, because of orange man. But so if Trump loses,

426
00:23:16.861 --> 00:23:20.250
I could see the machine just trying to spit out and destroy everyone that had

427
00:23:20.251 --> 00:23:25.230
anything to do with Trump. Um, in which case they'll view him. Yeah.

428
00:23:25.231 --> 00:23:29.040
The legacy will be, he was never a Republican. He was never a conservative.

429
00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:33.770
He was just this evil insurgent force. If he wins. I actually think you,

430
00:23:33.771 --> 00:23:38.760
you kick out or you neuter the, the interview effective people of the past.

431
00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:43.320
That would be a, I think a much, much better future. Um, all right. Oh,

432
00:23:43.321 --> 00:23:48.170
look at this. I'm getting a telemarketer me right now. My phone number, uh,

433
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:53.090
somehow got to these, got to every democratic list. Prop, this help this guy,

434
00:23:53.091 --> 00:23:56.570
we're going to stop racism all day long. I need, I need a new phone number.

435
00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.710
I'm going to do that later today, actually. Uh, okay. Real quick. Um,

436
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:03.740
I'm gonna skip that one cause I've sort of done that then about a drug cocktail

437
00:24:03.741 --> 00:24:06.860
that that Biden might be on again. I don't think he was on meth. That was,

438
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.570
that was Kelvin. Uh, Jacob,

439
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.180
I think I got to your question sort of about the alternative realities and the

440
00:24:11.181 --> 00:24:12.410
reality war. Oh,

441
00:24:12.411 --> 00:24:15.140
and here's a perfect one to end on because I've been focusing more on,

442
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:18.650
on the GOP and the right, uh, Forrest says, uh,

443
00:24:18.651 --> 00:24:22.760
what do you think will happen to the democratic party? If Biden loses,

444
00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:27.410
will they continue to exist or would the entire party implode? If so,

445
00:24:27.411 --> 00:24:29.630
do you think that would create room for a new party?

446
00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:32.570
I like this question and it's the perfect, it's the perfect place.

447
00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:34.070
<v 3>To end? Um.</v>

448
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:38.540
<v 1>What I think, well, first of all, that's what I want to happen, obviously,</v>

449
00:24:38.541 --> 00:24:41.270
right? The current democratic party, that,

450
00:24:41.271 --> 00:24:45.650
that is either radically left and using Biden as the host,

451
00:24:45.651 --> 00:24:48.830
as they he's, he's just the body with the alien inside,

452
00:24:48.831 --> 00:24:50.300
that's going to burst out of his stomach.

453
00:24:50.301 --> 00:24:55.070
A bloody monstrosity shaped as AOC is going to burst

454
00:24:55.071 --> 00:24:58.220
through the Biden thing. Once, once he's on board, if he wins,

455
00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:01.010
Biden cannot stop it. Biden will not be leading this thing.

456
00:25:01.011 --> 00:25:04.460
It's all very obvious. We all know it. It's just the truth. Okay.

457
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.620
But Joe Biden does not stand for anything.

458
00:25:06.621 --> 00:25:09.230
If Joe Biden stood for anything that he would have accomplished anything,

459
00:25:09.231 --> 00:25:12.170
but he's running away from all his accomplishments too, right?

460
00:25:12.171 --> 00:25:16.940
Because he was part of what now the left says is a systemically racist country

461
00:25:16.941 --> 00:25:20.720
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Okay. If Trump wins,

462
00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:24.470
then the great destruction can happen. And that's what needs to happen.

463
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:29.180
The Democrats and the lefties need to have their come to Jesus moment.

464
00:25:29.181 --> 00:25:30.740
They need to have their.

465
00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.260
<v 3>If you're an old school liberal.</v>

466
00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.170
<v 1>You have nothing in common with these new guys,</v>

467
00:25:36.171 --> 00:25:40.580
stop pretending you should be the same party, AOC. Who's wrong about everything.

468
00:25:40.581 --> 00:25:43.730
She actually said that she got one thing, right? A couple of months ago,

469
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.640
which is that she, I think she said something to the effect of,

470
00:25:46.641 --> 00:25:50.030
and this is before Biden was, was, uh, the contender.

471
00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.550
She said that I shouldn't be in the same party as Biden,

472
00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.460
meaning that these people have nothing to do with each other.

473
00:25:55.461 --> 00:26:00.440
The progressive is just used the democratic party to get in and

474
00:26:00.441 --> 00:26:04.700
you serve the power. That's what they're doing. Right? So if Biden loses,

475
00:26:04.701 --> 00:26:06.590
it's like, well finally, the Progressive's,

476
00:26:06.591 --> 00:26:10.760
they can just either destroy everybody else and then have their party. Or,

477
00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:15.950
and this is the much less likely one that the good liberals whoever's

478
00:26:15.951 --> 00:26:19.970
left after order 66 would come in and clean up the mess and get rid of these

479
00:26:19.971 --> 00:26:22.550
people and let, let Bernie start a third party,

480
00:26:22.551 --> 00:26:26.450
a socialist party with AOC and the squad and all of them,

481
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.060
but they won't do it because those guys don't want to create anything.

482
00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:31.460
All they're good at is ruining things. They want to destroy things.

483
00:26:31.461 --> 00:26:32.780
That's why in a weird way,

484
00:26:32.781 --> 00:26:36.230
the Progressive's don't really want to run anything because they're not good at

485
00:26:36.231 --> 00:26:38.510
running things. They're good at destroying things, right?

486
00:26:38.511 --> 00:26:43.070
So DeBlasio in New York city he's destroyed New York city ask

487
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:44.670
virtually anyone that lives there. Find me,

488
00:26:44.671 --> 00:26:47.520
somebody who thinks that there's something good happening in New York city,

489
00:26:47.521 --> 00:26:49.680
Eric, our city in Los Angeles,

490
00:26:49.681 --> 00:26:53.040
Gavin Newsome in San Francisco before when he was the mayor before he was the

491
00:26:53.041 --> 00:26:54.990
governor. Now Progressive's just destroy things.

492
00:26:54.991 --> 00:26:56.580
They're not good at building things, show up.

493
00:26:56.590 --> 00:27:00.990
Can somebody point me to one evidence that a progressive came into a city and

494
00:27:00.991 --> 00:27:05.580
cleaned it up and fixed homelessness or got rid of drugs or did something good

495
00:27:05.581 --> 00:27:09.000
with ho uh, uh, house prices and homes and all of those things.

496
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.020
It just doesn't happen.

497
00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:14.010
So I think the implosion of the democratic party is necessary.

498
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:17.580
I think that that hopefully will happen. And then, you know, again,

499
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.640
the silver lining on this thing is that maybe, uh,

500
00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.720
a Phoenix rises from the ashes, maybe after the implosion.

501
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:29.790
There's just a feeling of if there's something here

502
00:27:29.791 --> 00:27:31.590
between the lefties and the liberals,

503
00:27:31.591 --> 00:27:34.230
and if there's anything good about any of these set of ideas.

504
00:27:34.231 --> 00:27:37.470
And I'm not sure that there is any more that maybe something rises out of that

505
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:41.640
and, and a decent Democrat exists. And even if I wouldn't support that person,

506
00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:42.360
um,

507
00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:47.040
it would be a much healthier situation if we had a decent Republican party and a

508
00:27:47.041 --> 00:27:49.890
decent democratic party. So that would be the silver lining on everything.

509
00:27:49.891 --> 00:27:53.370
That would be the way I'd like to. I'd like to do it all right. People, uh,

510
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:57.210
it's Friday. I will be on Greg Gutfeld show tomorrow nights.

511
00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:02.160
You can catch me on Fox news. I think that's a 10:00 PM Eastern 7:00 PM Pacific.

512
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:04.830
And beyond that, I'm just gonna try to cool it. This weekend,

513
00:28:04.831 --> 00:28:08.220
not pay too much attention to politics. We got a couple of house projects.

514
00:28:08.221 --> 00:28:11.040
I hope you are able to get off the grid a little bit yourself and enjoy

515
00:28:11.041 --> 00:28:15.510
yourselves and eat some good food and run around and get out there and live your

516
00:28:15.511 --> 00:28:17.610
life because that's what it's all about. All right. See you guys.

517
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.750
<v 0>Yeah.</v>
