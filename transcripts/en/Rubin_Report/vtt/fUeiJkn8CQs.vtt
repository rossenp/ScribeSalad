1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.100
<v 0>There were 70 million of these dropped by</v>

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.040
allied air force, the American airport.

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.000
And it's gives the name of 12 different cities.

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.050
It says we have a bomb that has more powerful.

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.410
That is more powerful than all of the weaponry.

6
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:23.610
We have dropped in Europe in one bomb.

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.130
If you're in one of these 12 cities, Nagasaki, and Hiroshima,

8
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.210
where two of those cities, please leave now.

9
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.780
<v 1>Couple of other things.</v>

10
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.960
<v 0>Because I think change history, you know what this is.</v>

11
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.520
<v 2>I mean, this it's gotta be well, there's Japanese markings on there, right?</v>

12
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.240
So this is, Oh God, well, that's not dropping. No,

13
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.350
it's certainly not the dropping of the nukes.

14
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.580
<v 0>Okay. But that's what this is about. Yeah. Okay. The back. Okay.</v>

15
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.890
There were 70 million of these dropped by

16
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.830
allied air force, the American airport.

17
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.790
And it's gives the name of 12 different cities.

18
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.840
It says we have a bomb that has more powerful.

19
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.230
That is more powerful than all of the weaponry.

20
00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:22.370
We have dropped in Europe in one bomb.

21
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.920
If you're in one of these 12 cities, Nagasaki, and Hiroshima,

22
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.280
where two of those cities, please leave.

23
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.920
Now if your country,

24
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:38.630
what if your emperor will not surrender? We will be left with no choice,

25
00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.310
but it is so horrific.

26
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.320
Please take food and water and clothing and leave the cities.

27
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.980
We're not targeting you. Please leave.

28
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.910
Those supplies will be in very short supply. Afterwards,

29
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.230
you were shot. If you picked one up, wow,

30
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.910
what country tells their people? We're coming.

31
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.320
We have this bomb. We're going to drop it by this date.

32
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.570
And it's going to happen in one of these cities.

33
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.160
<v 2>Well, there's one country that does it now,</v>

34
00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:12.830
but the left is not thrilled with that country. Right?

35
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.590
<v 0>One. Yeah. How come we don't know about that?</v>

36
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.320
Every time we hear about America is so bad,

37
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.120
they always bring up the atomic bomb. Well, can you throw this?

38
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.530
<v 2>Oh, this is incredible. Yeah. Uh.</v>

39
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.820
<v 0>This is an original letter to the Hitler youth from Neville Chamberlain.</v>

40
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.660
Um, this talks about, um,

41
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.460
I welcomed the intention of the German youth movement to devote a special, uh,

42
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.760
issue of the magazine, uh, to, uh,

43
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.140
your ideals in it. He talks about he's met with the fewer.

44
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.960
He w he's a man of peace and, uh.

45
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.790
<v 2>Germany are set upon you to Hitler.</v>

46
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.530
<v 0>Youth Neville, Chamberlain.</v>

47
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.070
That one I got just because I appeasement never,

48
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.383
ever works.

49
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.510
<v 2>Listen to the last line. I mean, I know you've read it,</v>

50
00:03:06.511 --> 00:03:09.330
but the admirable motto of the year of understanding,

51
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.770
which you have chosen for the year of 1938 shows the part that you are playing

52
00:03:13.771 --> 00:03:18.390
in this work. I mean, talk about appeasement and confusion. Yep.

53
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.003
Wow.

54
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.810
<v 0>Well, of other things, this is wonderful. Read it.</v>

55
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.580
Okay.

56
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.821
<v 2>I,</v>

57
00:03:26.821 --> 00:03:30.990
Ronald Reagan do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of the

58
00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:34.650
president of the United States and will to the best of my ability preserve,

59
00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:39.270
protect, and defend the constitution of the United States. So help me, God,

60
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.870
Ronald Reagan, January 20th, 1980.

61
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.740
And on the top two Nancy who brightens the, uh,

62
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.250
is it the corner who Britons, who brightens,

63
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.570
brightens the corner where we are? Yeah. Wow.

64
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.560
That's the one, that's the one, that's the one.

65
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.040
<v 0>Right in front of him as he was taking the oath of office.</v>

66
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.840
And how many people,

67
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.970
how many people really mean that mean those words.

68
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.280
Um, have you ever heard of, uh, uh, Colonel stone?

69
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.880
Uh, he was a guy. Um, he was, um,

70
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.110
military, actually the guy who, uh,

71
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.790
first protected,

72
00:04:26.791 --> 00:04:31.380
kind of our first secret service agent first protected Abraham Lincoln when he

73
00:04:31.381 --> 00:04:36.090
was coming in to, uh, Washington for the very first time. He's the guy who,

74
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.710
who said, we gotta get you out. We're going to have you go into a theater.

75
00:04:40.711 --> 00:04:41.940
We're going to have you change clothes.

76
00:04:41.941 --> 00:04:43.740
You're going to hunch over like a little old lady.

77
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.110
And we're going to get you out the back into a carriage.

78
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:48.120
And we're going to get you on train, take you to Pittsburgh,

79
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.220
because everybody's going to think that you're going to Washington.

80
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.220
We'll get you to Pittsburgh. They will take another train into Washington.

81
00:04:53.221 --> 00:04:57.930
And no one will know it saved his life, saved his life. He became,

82
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.270
uh, a Colonel in, um, the, uh, Northern army in the fight,

83
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.920
in the civil war. And he refused to hate the other side.

84
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.890
He just thought they were wrong, but he refused to hate them.

85
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.000
That caused a lot of problems with a lot of politicians because they were

86
00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:19.050
whipping up the hate. It's why, uh, Lincoln's,

87
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.900
vice-president walked out and was so upset. It's why we have a picture of,

88
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.680
uh,

89
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.660
the only picture that is of John Wilkes booth and Abraham Lincoln

90
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.350
in the same picture and booth is behind him.

91
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.390
And it's at the second inaugural address.

92
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.260
And he actually tried to kill him there because he was so enraged that this guy

93
00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:43.800
would say, let's come together. Let's heal these wounds.

94
00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:47.730
He was enraged by that and really wanted to kill him with his own hands and

95
00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:51.210
attempted to do it. Well. Um, uh,

96
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.070
this Colonel became a Colonel in the civil war.

97
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.420
He was for something that he never did.

98
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:03.140
It was a trumped up charge because he became very unpopular with, with, uh,

99
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.230
Congress, Congress, uh, tried him.

100
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.210
He wasn't allowed to even put on a defense.

101
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.220
He wasn't allowed to speak in front of Congress.

102
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.700
They never came to a verdict because they know that it would have been,

103
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.380
he would have been set free. So he was held, um, in prison.

104
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.230
He was held in prison. And I think for about six months,

105
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.730
Lincoln found out about it and said, what the hell are you doing? Charge him,

106
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.230
convict him, or let him go. And, uh, they didn't,

107
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.270
they waited another six or eight months.

108
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.520
Lincoln found out about it again and just said, get him out. He was so upset.

109
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.331
He went over,

110
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:43.100
he left the United States and he went over and he was working for the French in

111
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:46.430
Egypt, years later, he comes back. He's thinking,

112
00:06:46.431 --> 00:06:50.210
he's hoping everybody is going to forget about those things that they said about

113
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:54.290
him. He's at home. He gets a knock on the door. No one will hire him.

114
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.710
They do remember no one will hire him. He opens up the door,

115
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.270
it's two representatives from the United States government. And they said,

116
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.010
Colonel, we understand you were in Egypt and you were working with the French.

117
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.130
And he said, yes. And, uh, they said,

118
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.540
so do you speak and read French? Yes.

119
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:16.460
Good.

120
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.350
Cause we just got a big box of stuff and we don't know how to put it together.

121
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.690
It was the statue of Liberty. Oh my God.

122
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.370
This is his purchase order for all of the stones,

123
00:07:28.371 --> 00:07:32.240
for the base of the statue of Liberty. He's the guy,

124
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.680
the guy who could be the worst on America has every reason to be

125
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.510
at America. He builds the statue of.

126
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.760
<v 2>This is incredible. Colonel,</v>

127
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.630
please inform us at what price you can furnish during the summer of

128
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:51.310
1884, about 8,000 cubic yards of stone.

129
00:07:51.311 --> 00:07:56.110
According to the sample for, to you just sat nuts. Just incredible.

130
00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:01.480
<v 0>So this is, this is an example. This is,</v>

131
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:06.400
uh, early American texting. Okay. Do you know who,

132
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.620
um, do you know who, uh, Matt, Anthony Wayne is? I feel that I should. Okay.

133
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:16.090
He's a general on our, on the American side, in the revolution,

134
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.750
he was great, but he was, he was an animal. Okay.

135
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.200
This is a picture of him in the, uh,

136
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.220
in the battle of I'm trying to remember which battle the Stony point.

137
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:32.680
So Stony point, he shot in the head. Okay. He's got a bullet,

138
00:08:32.681 --> 00:08:37.150
a big, huge bullet in his head and he keeps going and they're like general,

139
00:08:37.151 --> 00:08:39.310
general, general. And he's like, come on, let's go.

140
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.540
And so they win and they, uh,

141
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.010
they bring him in and they're like,

142
00:08:45.011 --> 00:08:49.960
we have to get the bullet out of your head. He's like,

143
00:08:49.961 --> 00:08:53.320
fine, fine, but I need a piece of paper and pencil.

144
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.920
So this is his letter to George Washington that

145
00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:03.630
says, Hey, we won. And it says, it says before, he's got the bullet.

146
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:07.350
He writes this letter and it's from Stony point 16,

147
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:10.980
July two, 2:00 AM, dear general,

148
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.840
the Fort and the Garrison with curl Johnstone are hours. Listen to this line,

149
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:21.600
your officers and men behaved like men who are determined to

150
00:09:21.601 --> 00:09:25.890
be free. I read that line and I thought,

151
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.770
what does that even mean to live your life determined to be free.

152
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.970
Most Americans are not there. Um,

153
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.890
so he writes it to George Washington, George Washington, it's folded up,

154
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.450
George Washington then takes it.

155
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.380
And he puts it in his letter.

156
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:50.040
This is a letter to the governor who says, Hey,

157
00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:53.250
I want to tell you about the war. Here's the Colonel's message.

158
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:58.080
So he takes this message, puts it in his letter. That's his signature? Uh, no,

159
00:09:58.081 --> 00:10:00.870
it's this, it's one of these,

160
00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:03.480
I think this is the Washington signature. No,

161
00:10:03.481 --> 00:10:06.570
that's George Washington signature there. Yep. Very good. Does it?

162
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.480
He puts that letter in here. He sends it to the governor.

163
00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:13.440
This is the governor's letter where he takes both of these letters.
