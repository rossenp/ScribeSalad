00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.110
<v 0>My moment was the headline of the New York times.</v>

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:05.993
Uh, after,

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.500
I guess it was the first or second Republican debate where,

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.130
uh,

5
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.640
Trump had gone on CNN and talked about how making Kelly was bleeding through.

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.750
And I, and I thought, okay, well, whatever,

7
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.580
but it was the top headline at the top of the New York

8
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:25.500
times. And I thought that is so strange.

9
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.070
Why is that to humiliate Trump to some degree,

10
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.370
this was just something that you could, you could kind of, you know,

11
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.650
talk about minimally,

12
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.630
but to create an entire narrative over this in order to humiliate them or to get

13
00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:43.860
them canceled was B the beginning for me of like, Oh,

14
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.020
there's something else going on. There's a secret history here.

15
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.470
<v 2>And you mentioned canceled culture before. And then I brought up the,</v>

16
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.580
the charges of misogyny related to American psycho. Yeah.

17
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.550
So I just read on your Wikipedia and if it's on Wikipedia,

18
00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:09.170
it's gotta be true that you had the deal for American psycho with Simon and

19
00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:12.860
Schuster, but then because what was it women have now,

20
00:01:12.861 --> 00:01:16.880
or the now of women or the something they accused you of being misogynistic.

21
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.520
And then, and then was the book dropped. I mean,

22
00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:22.490
this is sort of an early version of cancel calls. Oh, it is. Yeah,

23
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.440
it was that story up for me. I got it.

24
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.030
<v 0>Simon Schuster, big deal at Simon and Schuster. I turned the book in,</v>

25
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.040
this is a long time ago in December of 1989.

26
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.320
And throughout 1990,

27
00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:41.090
the book kind of moved through the usual runs of the ladder that it does through

28
00:01:41.091 --> 00:01:45.650
a publishing house, getting copy edited. We figured out a cover. Um, your,

29
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.900
your editor does some basic editing on it,

30
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.650
but there were people in the publishing house who were very offended by American

31
00:01:51.651 --> 00:01:55.700
psycho, uh, usually assistance young people working in, in the,

32
00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.500
in the publishing house and weeks started happening,

33
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.720
uh, leaks of some of the most violent passages were being sent to the press and

34
00:02:05.721 --> 00:02:09.340
certain members of the press. And so suddenly it became a story, uh,

35
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.460
and the book hadn't been published yet,

36
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.100
but it became a story and it became more and more controversial.

37
00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:16.700
The more and more that these notorious scenes were leaked. And of course,

38
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:20.840
out of context, they're horrible. Um, and so anyway, uh,

39
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.300
the controversy got louder and louder and louder, and yes,

40
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.380
kind of like today in a way, uh, Simon and Schuster, uh,

41
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.940
collapsed and said,

42
00:02:28.941 --> 00:02:33.110
we are not going to publish this book because of the outcry in the media. Now,

43
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.480
this is another thing that happened then is that it was actually the corporation

44
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.140
that owned Simon and Schuster that demanded the cancellation.

45
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.380
It was Gulf and Western who owned assignment issues.

46
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.040
And they head of Gulf and Western did not like the controversy did not like the

47
00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:49.880
fact that his,

48
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.930
his corporation was being blemished by this book who ordered the cancellation.

49
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.820
I knew the head of that company of Simon and Schuster quite well. Um, and I,

50
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.740
that he wasn't the one who canceled it, but he was the fall guy.

51
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.060
He had to take it. So anyway, that is what happened, uh, as a happy ending,

52
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:11.170
because a better publisher picked up American psycho and they published it a few

53
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:14.260
months later. And, you know, the rest is whatever it is, right.

54
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.510
<v 2>So it definitely ends happily. And the movies made, never.</v>

55
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.680
<v 0>Had to say one thing that's very interesting is that Tammy Bruce was the head of</v>

56
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:25.660
now who was the most against American psycho. She was my nemesis then in 1991.

57
00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:29.770
And now that's hilarious. And now she's on, she's one of the leading lights,

58
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:33.700
the bright license Fox, actually. And so, uh, I, uh, I don't know,

59
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:36.610
I find that kind of ironic in the way that the culture war.

60
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.471
<v 2>I mean,</v>

61
00:03:37.471 --> 00:03:40.860
that fits so much of a lot of the stuff that we've talked about privately

62
00:03:40.861 --> 00:03:45.090
because the wa I've only met Tammy Bruce once it was at, uh, David Horowitz,

63
00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:47.760
freedom center thing, and David Horowitz was a famous left.

64
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.740
Each children of communists who then, you know, became, uh, became, you know,

65
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.930
conservatives and his conference.

66
00:03:54.931 --> 00:03:59.880
He did a thing on sort of the new generation of former lefties that have sort

67
00:03:59.881 --> 00:04:03.000
of woken up. And it was me, Tammy, Bruce, Candace Owens, and,

68
00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:06.030
and a couple other people's that's the only time I met her. And it's funny,

69
00:04:06.031 --> 00:04:08.490
she was opposed to you back then. And here you are,

70
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.430
that's actually a great segue for a little political stuff.

71
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.620
Where are you politically? I mean, I,

72
00:04:13.621 --> 00:04:16.530
I have a sense of kind of where you're at and, and everything.

73
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.020
These days feels sort of a morphous, but.

74
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.970
<v 0>Um, I was never a political person. I just wasn't,</v>

75
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.240
maybe it was because I was privileged to a degree and politics just didn't

76
00:04:27.241 --> 00:04:30.870
interest me. Why would they, I was a privileged white kid and, uh,

77
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.860
moving from high school into college during the Reagan eighties everything's

78
00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:39.930
seemed whatever. I mean, I kinda, I guess I complained about Reagan mindlessly,

79
00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:42.090
like all of my other kids in my class,

80
00:04:42.091 --> 00:04:44.990
and a lot of people took American psycho to be, uh,

81
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.850
a book that was critical of the values of the Reagan eighties.

82
00:04:47.851 --> 00:04:51.210
And it was critical of some of the cultural values, certainly, uh,

83
00:04:51.211 --> 00:04:55.260
about greed and about yuppie then. But I ended up beef with Ronald Reagan.

84
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.950
I mean, that, wasn't part of what that book was about. Uh, some of his iconic,

85
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.900
uh, iconic iconography is used in the book, but, you know, that was just,

86
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.560
he was as the president during the time that that book took place. Um, and then,

87
00:05:07.561 --> 00:05:07.861
you know,

88
00:05:07.861 --> 00:05:12.270
I was living with someone for a long time who was very invested in politics,

89
00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:15.840
actually ran a couple of gubernatorial campaigns in the nineties,

90
00:05:15.841 --> 00:05:18.120
and I got a close up look to that and I just hated it.

91
00:05:18.121 --> 00:05:20.940
I just hated the whole notion of how it was all played out.

92
00:05:20.941 --> 00:05:25.380
And none of it interested me and it really, and I, I, uh,

93
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.930
during the Obama era, and everything's funny, I mean,

94
00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:31.290
I wasn't really paying attention. Something happened with Trump.

95
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.400
Something happened with Trump that I think has happened to all of us to one

96
00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:39.750
degree or another something was announced. And I, again,

97
00:05:39.751 --> 00:05:43.920
another presidential election cycles coming up and I'm kind of falling in it,

98
00:05:43.921 --> 00:05:47.970
but suddenly I'm following it because it's very interesting to me how the media

99
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.340
is treating the Donald Trump narrative.

100
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.810
Now I'm talking about a media that I had been following closely for 30 years and

101
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.210
trusted someone the New York times, CNN, New York times and CNN,

102
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:00.590
all of my life,

103
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.780
I read them and I trusted them and I believed in them and it was all they were,

104
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:08.750
you know, and I began to think that they were missing the story,

105
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.890
that they were going off a different path. That really wasn't the reality,

106
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.670
that wasn't the reality that there was a new narrative that they were forming.

107
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.700
And this began to bother me.

108
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.940
And I don't know why I hear ya.

109
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.620
I don't know why I am I'm non-partisan I never saw myself as a,

110
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.850
I never saw myself really. If I saw, I think we have the similar trajectory.

111
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.800
I think that I was a liberal guy who was gay and was,

112
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.210
you know, rightly so rightly so. It was fine. Uh, not never stridently,

113
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.370
never far left or whatever, but I, you know,

114
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.970
I believe in the good fight on the liberal side, something happened.

115
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.580
I began to see that the sign was curdling. Yeah.

116
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.000
<v 2>Do you remember, do you remember a moment? Cause a lot of ideas,</v>

117
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.580
a lot of people have like the moment. Yeah. What was mine?

118
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.650
<v 0>The moment was the headline of the New York times, uh,</v>

119
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:00.520
after,

120
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.020
I guess it was the first or second Republican debate where,

121
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:05.620
uh,

122
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.130
Trump had gone on CNN and talked about how making Kelly was bleeding through.

123
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.440
<v 2>Her eyes. And I, and.</v>

124
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.240
<v 0>I thought, okay, well, whatever,</v>

125
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.070
but it was the top headline at the top of the New York

126
00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:19.990
times. And I thought that is so strange.

127
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.560
Why is that to humiliate Trump to some degree,

128
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.890
this was just something that you could, you could kind of, you know,

129
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.140
talk about minimally,

130
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:34.120
but to create an entire narrative over this in order to humiliate him or to get

131
00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:38.350
them canceled was B the beginning for me of like, Oh,

132
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.510
there's something else going on. There's a secret history here.

133
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.880
And that is how I began to become somewhat,

134
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:51.220
uh, radicalized in a way from who I thought I was to where I

135
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:55.780
ended up being. And, uh, again, I have to say, I'm not a partisan.

136
00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.130
Uh, I, I still am someone who, uh,

137
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.150
is low the vote I'm in the majority of this country. Uh,

138
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.380
and yet what I mean.

139
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.210
<v 2>Notice, you mean you didn't go to my dumping,</v>

140
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.350
my dumpy polling station over here where I'm pretty sure I can track the area

141
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:12.940
you weren't there yesterday.

142
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.250
<v 0>No, I was not there and I'm not going.</v>

143
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.260
<v 2>To be there. Um, but, um.</v>

144
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:22.120
<v 0>Um, I, uh, so, but I, what I found so interesting and really what white,</v>

145
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:27.100
a lot of it is about is about how I saw the left begin to disintegrate and

146
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:31.150
a part of the arm. And I thought I was on, I was, I thought it was in that part,

147
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.210
that side of the theater. And I realized that I'm not,

148
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:38.020
and I don't want to be on this side of the theater if it is this hysterical,

149
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.140
this crazed and it's. And also,

150
00:08:41.141 --> 00:08:45.700
I really hated the creation of narratives that were obviously not

151
00:08:45.701 --> 00:08:50.590
true that were being used to undermine a legally elected president.

152
00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:52.810
Whether I liked him or didn't like him,

153
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:56.940
I just thought there was something so distinctly un-American about the way the

154
00:08:56.941 --> 00:09:00.840
left was, uh, creating their stories,

155
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:05.550
that it just began to, um, uh, unearthed.

156
00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.900
<v 2>Yeah. You know, what's super interesting about that, that David Horowitz,</v>

157
00:09:08.901 --> 00:09:12.860
who we just mentioned when I had him in here, um, he's a huge Trump supporter.

158
00:09:12.861 --> 00:09:15.350
And I asked him, do you have a moment when that happened?

159
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.470
And he mentioned the Megan Kelly, uh, bleeding line.

160
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.530
Cause he said for him as someone that had was a conservative, but was,

161
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.840
but didn't understand the Trump thing.

162
00:09:23.841 --> 00:09:25.670
He's like that moment got it for him because,

163
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.490
because it was basically Trump being like, screw all of you,

164
00:09:28.491 --> 00:09:29.900
I played by none of your rules.

165
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:34.040
So that same moment that sort of had you wake up from a media perspective as a

166
00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:37.310
lefty for him as a conservative was like, that was why he loved Trump.

167
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:42.290
<v 0>Weird because yes, the Trump screw all the rules guy is what everyone loves.</v>

168
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.060
That's what everybody loves. Yeah.

169
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.840
And it's so interesting that yet on the other side is what a lot of people are

170
00:09:47.841 --> 00:09:48.770
horrified by.

171
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.560
<v 3>Who wouldn't normally learn. Right. They're supposed to be.</v>

172
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.210
<v 0>And yet, because it's Trump and this is the problem with Trump.</v>

173
00:09:56.211 --> 00:09:58.820
And I talk about this again in the book, it is about,

174
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.710
I really believe it's about an aesthetic it's about this guy

175
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:04.610
and what he looks like.

176
00:10:04.611 --> 00:10:08.600
And I always have said that if Trump was in the package of a Mitt Romney,

177
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.520
it might be more palatable for a lot of people.

178
00:10:10.521 --> 00:10:15.350
And we certainly would not have this kind of like, uh, re what is truly,

179
00:10:15.351 --> 00:10:16.184
I believe Trump story.

180
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:16.700
<v 3>Syndrome.</v>

181
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.970
