00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.800
<v 1>What's up people.</v>

3
00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:13.430
It is November 25th,

4
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.140
2021 day before Thanksgiving. I'm Dave Rubin and this is the Rubin report.

5
00:00:18.141 --> 00:00:20.600
Correct message. I just realized, as I looked to the side,

6
00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:23.960
I looked at my camera for a second on the screen over there, I'm dressed like,

7
00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:26.390
it's like, it's the summer today. This is like, I'm in,

8
00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:31.250
I'm going to a cocktail party on the roof in Beverly Hills when I should be

9
00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:34.070
in some sort of more festive fall thing.

10
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.770
But I guess I'll have to make up for that next week.

11
00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:39.920
I'll do a little more of a fall outfit, some darker colors,

12
00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:42.410
maybe some Browns and some oranges right now.

13
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.550
I look like I'm off to a Cabo or something for a very important business

14
00:00:46.551 --> 00:00:50.390
meeting. Um, Hey, real quick, before we do anything else,

15
00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:53.660
I want to address that two days ago, we showed you a video, uh,

16
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.830
that I said to people I wanted to source better and we weren't exactly sure what

17
00:00:57.831 --> 00:00:59.150
was going on, but it was a video of,

18
00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:04.010
of police officers assaulting somebody over violating curfew.

19
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.500
And I said that according to the Twitter account, it came from,

20
00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:08.240
it was from California. Uh,

21
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.690
but if we had any more information that we would address it and I'm not above

22
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.200
being honest with you guys, actually, that's exactly how I want to be.

23
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.920
So it turns out that that video is from October in Wisconsin.

24
00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:21.650
So it's just worth mentioning. Uh, but I, I,

25
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.910
although I had a feeling that maybe it wasn't exactly what it was, what it was,

26
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.410
I thought it was worth showing to you guys because the idea of people being

27
00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:34.850
assaulted and attacked by police officers for violating curfew in America is

28
00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:35.331
scary.

29
00:01:35.331 --> 00:01:40.160
Whether it happens in October in Wisconsin or whether it happens in

30
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:42.260
November in California. So anyway, uh,

31
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.100
just putting that out there for a public information, uh,

32
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.560
and before we get to today's stories, uh, yes,

33
00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:51.500
tomorrow guys is Thanksgiving.

34
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.820
That means that right now, as I speak,

35
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.380
as you watch this,

36
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.690
there are gangs of roofing criminals going

37
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.990
to other people's houses, getting into cars,

38
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.620
sometimes crossing state lines.

39
00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:14.600
You hear me state lines to go visit friends,

40
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.530
family members, new acquaintances,

41
00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:20.780
that they were just happened to be invited to their house,

42
00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:25.040
to celebrate Thanksgiving. There are criminals amongst us here in America.

43
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.450
People who will literally literally eat

44
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.100
Turkey and stuffing and mashed potatoes

45
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.380
and cranberry sauce with other people in

46
00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:42.920
someone else's home. They're preparing to do that. And in many cases,

47
00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:44.660
traveling to those people right now,

48
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.870
there are people not just doing this via car.

49
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.850
There are people getting on airplanes to go visit,

50
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.270
loved ones to celebrate the holiday tomorrow.

51
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.000
And we're just going to sit here and let it happen. Okay.

52
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.940
What has happened to America? What has happened? I, I don't know.

53
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.560
It's just, it's scary stuff.

54
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:10.330
So I just wanted to address that up front that most of us are now Outlaws on the

55
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:11.380
run from the government,

56
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:14.650
because you're probably going to have Thanksgiving with someone that doesn't

57
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:19.360
live in your house, and this is how stupid everything has become.

58
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.470
Uh, but speaking of stupidity, uh, we're gonna do a couple of stories today.

59
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:24.011
And then, uh,

60
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:26.620
and then I just want to give you guys a nice Thanksgiving message and then we're

61
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:29.710
not doing a show tomorrow. We're not doing a show on Friday.

62
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:31.750
We're not doing a show over the weekend.

63
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:34.750
I want to give my guys a little time off it's it's time to be thankful.

64
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:37.270
And I hope that you're going to be with family and friends tomorrow and over the

65
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:39.060
weekend. And maybe we can all, uh,

66
00:03:39.061 --> 00:03:42.700
avoid a little bit of the political madness and the current events for,

67
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:46.090
for a couple of days. Uh, so the stories we're covering today, uh,

68
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.560
bill de Blasio, who's probably the worst mayor in all of America.

69
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:53.020
And that's tough because, you know, we have cities like Portland, Seattle,

70
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:54.910
Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Uh,

71
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.530
he has COVID-19 checkpoints going up at bridges right

72
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:02.200
now. Uh, if any of you saw, I am legend,

73
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:04.660
I tweeted out the video this morning.

74
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:08.170
Remember when will Smith was trying to get his family out of New York city?

75
00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.250
They had checkpoints at bridges in New York city did not go that well for will

76
00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:14.290
Smith and family. So we're going to talk about that.

77
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.940
And then I'm going to show you two clips.

78
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:19.360
One from NBC news and one from ABC news,

79
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.830
they are super duper excited about this Biden administration.

80
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:28.660
And they are just so happy to be doing journalism about people that they

81
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:32.710
love and they can't contain their happiness and their even coordinating their

82
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:37.450
language around the happiness that they all have. It's very, very exciting. Uh,

83
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:40.690
and then two more quick stories. Uh, one this incredible,

84
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.340
absolutely freaking staggeringly mind-blowingly phenomenal

85
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.420
video out of the United Arab Emirates, where Avi Berkowitz,

86
00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:50.770
who works for the Trump administration.

87
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.760
And it had something to do with the deals that are causing actual peace in the

88
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:55.780
middle East. Well,

89
00:04:55.781 --> 00:05:00.130
now they've got Israeli fruit in the United Arab Emirates and he takes a video

90
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:03.520
at a store and they've got the flags of the countries. And it's just incredible.

91
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:06.040
And I'm guessing you haven't seen the video because although it went,

92
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.660
it went wild on Twitter in amongst the right wing, scary conservatives. Um,

93
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.901
you know,

94
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:14.020
it doesn't really fit the narrative that Trump might have done something good

95
00:05:14.021 --> 00:05:16.750
for the world. So you're not going to see it on mainstream. Uh,

96
00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:20.380
and then finally, governor Kate Brown. Well,

97
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:24.730
she's got a Thanksgiving video that I saw this morning,

98
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.990
basically telling you to invite uninvite everybody to your Thanksgiving.

99
00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.320
And I thought it would be worth seeing to show how hysterically psychotic these

100
00:05:32.321 --> 00:05:35.440
people are. And then I'll wish you guys all Thanksgiving. Uh,

101
00:05:35.441 --> 00:05:37.120
but before we get to any of that guys,

102
00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:40.690
this holiday season will undoubtedly be like no other.

103
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.310
There is no doubt about that.

104
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.450
Families may not have the opportunity to be physically together due to COVID-19

105
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.900
and the lockdown, social distancing, and financial restraints.

106
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.450
Despite the global events that may keep us apart.

107
00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:57.070
Physically ancestry brings you closer to family past and present through your

108

113
00:06:10.571 --> 00:06:13.870
And then I've got a genealogist in my family. Who's even gone further than that.

114
00:06:13.871 --> 00:06:14.710

127
00:06:59.411 --> 00:07:03.850
but criminals, I mean, I'm talking about far, right?

128
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.570
Gangs of criminals, people that right now they're traveling,

129
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.920
you might be traveling right now.

130
00:07:08.921 --> 00:07:13.540
You might be in a car watching this on your phone, traveling clan desk,

131
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.460
dine to go have Turkey with your grandmother. You sick freak. Okay.

132
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.460
You might be one of the people doing this. Well, bill de Blasio,

133
00:07:21.461 --> 00:07:26.140
the mayor of New York city, the far left lunatic, who's ruined New York city.

134
00:07:26.141 --> 00:07:29.500
And all of my family members have escaped New York city already wisely,

135
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.940
a city that I spent most of my adult life in that I absolutely loved the

136
00:07:33.941 --> 00:07:38.080
cultural. And, and in many ways, not just cultural,

137
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.440
the political, I think you could argue political also, not just DC,

138
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.450
but like the center of the world in many ways, this man has helped destroy it.

139
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.020
Uh,

140
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.610
and now he's going to have COVID checkpoints at bridges into New York city to

141
00:07:51.611 --> 00:07:55.840
catch and find violators of his travel ban. Uh,

142
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.830
got a couple of quotes here from just the news under orders of mayor,

143
00:07:59.831 --> 00:08:00.970
bill de Blasio,

144
00:08:00.971 --> 00:08:05.230
New York city will have vehicle checkpoints manned by law enforcement of

145
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:10.360
officers at key bridges and crossings to strictly enforce travel

146
00:08:10.361 --> 00:08:13.270
quarantine over the Thanksgiving holiday.

147
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.830
The city's regulations mandate that travelers either quarantined for

148
00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:22.300
14 days or take a COVID 19 test to prove that they don't have the

149
00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:27.220
virus by Elations of self quarantine will be enforced and ma may carry fines

150
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:31.840
of one to $2,000 according to the mayor's office. Okay,

151
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:36.250
you guys, I think we probably share a similar sentiment on just these,

152
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.450
these hysterically overreaching. I would argue at this point,

153
00:08:40.451 --> 00:08:45.220
anti-constitutional authoritarian lockdowns that they are doing, uh,

154
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:48.760
the idea that you cannot travel freely in the United States,

155
00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:53.110
that you cannot be trusted to say, if you live in New York city, I mean,

156
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.350
think about it this way. When they're talking about the bridges of new city.

157
00:08:55.351 --> 00:08:58.240
So if you're in New York city and you want to travel out to New York city,

158
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.140
you're probably going to long Island, you might be going to Westchester Jersey,

159
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.200
Pennsylvania, Connecticut, like that's, you know, and then there's some,

160
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.060
obviously some States further than that,

161
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.570
but you're doing like the tri-state area kind of thing. And most likely,

162
00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:10.710
you're going to family,

163
00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:15.690
the idea that the government and this lunatic mayor thinks that you can't

164
00:09:15.691 --> 00:09:17.640
make the right decisions for your family,

165
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.200
so that if you get in the car with your family and then go to somebody's house

166
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:27.030
and decide to have the most to celebrate actually the most

167
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:31.050
important American holiday with members of your family or friends,

168
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:33.750
and that you can't be trusted to do it responsibly or,

169
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:36.090
or whatever way you feel you should. And that,

170
00:09:36.091 --> 00:09:40.380
that then gives them a right to have checkpoints on our

171
00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:44.880
bridges. Like guys, if you don't see it already, I don't know what to tell you,

172
00:09:44.881 --> 00:09:47.490
but this is not about COVID. At this point,

173
00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.420
they are testing to see how far they can push you. Can we have,

174
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:56.220
what else can we have lockdowns for? What else can we have, uh, checkpoints for?

175
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.510
Can I see your papers? Remember, remember when seeing papers, uh, that,

176
00:10:00.511 --> 00:10:04.530
that was a bad thing in, in Nazi Germany. Remember that like again,

177
00:10:04.531 --> 00:10:05.940
and I say it every time,

178
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.750
because I know people want to misquote me and misinterpret what I say that is

179
00:10:09.751 --> 00:10:14.460
not to diminish the reality of COVID 1990 9% of people,

180
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:19.260
97.5 to 99% of people get better. We know we've got these vaccines coming.

181
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.160
The idea that we are letting the governments run crazy with this stuff is

182
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:27.270
absolutely insane. Um, they also said there's a couple of other points here.

183
00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.380
The New York city sheriff said that the Sheriff's office will be conducting spot

184
00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:34.800
checks when out of state buses drop people off.

185
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.650
So if grandma got on a bus to come visit you,

186
00:10:37.651 --> 00:10:40.890
she's also going to get questioned when she gets off that bus. That seems,

187
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.950
that seems good. Uh, Oh, and governor Cuomo, he wants,

188
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.650
he wanted everybody to cancel all their plans.

189
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:50.430
Then it turned out that he was going to celebrate Thanksgiving with his 89 year

190
00:10:50.431 --> 00:10:54.390
old mother who he doesn't live with and he got shamed. And now he's saying,

191
00:10:54.391 --> 00:10:57.390
he's just going to work all day. Yeah, work. Right. You're the governor.

192
00:10:57.391 --> 00:11:01.710
You don't have anything to do. You're you're you're come on fool. Uh, and, uh,

193
00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.390
Oh, well now actually,

194
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.930
maybe this has been even updated since I last looked at it. Um,

195
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:09.330
now he's saying that maybe his mother,

196
00:11:09.331 --> 00:11:13.230
his 89 year old mother and his two kids will come to his place up in Albany.

197
00:11:13.231 --> 00:11:16.920
So I'm actually unclear about that, but here's, here's one for you,

198
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.050
for everybody that, uh,

199
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:23.520
takes a picture of a well-known mayor or governor,

200
00:11:23.521 --> 00:11:26.850
a mayor of a major city or a governor breaking their own rules.

201
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.580
If you can get a picture of it, I'll give you a 500 bucks.

202
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.950
So I'll do that up to say 2000 bucks. So, uh,

203
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.960
for people that I can find a picture,

204
00:11:33.961 --> 00:11:37.590
you find me a picture of daba Newsome with other people outside of his family,

205
00:11:37.591 --> 00:11:42.390
or build a Blasio outside his family or Cuomo or any of these clowns.

206
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:47.160
I'll throw in 500 bucks per picture that you take as long as it's all confirmed

207
00:11:47.161 --> 00:11:49.020
and good to go and not breaking any laws,

208
00:11:49.021 --> 00:11:52.170
don't break into anyone's homes or anything like that, please.

209
00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.650
But these people are all frauds.

210
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.560
We know they're going to celebrate holidays in ways that they're,

211
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.280
that they're telling you not to celebrate them. And,

212
00:11:59.281 --> 00:12:03.940
and of all years that we ever needed to, to be thankful, right.

213
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.700
And, and to be around family, right?

214
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:10.390
My own family's Thanksgiving is messy this year because of certain,

215
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.240
because of age and people not wanting to travel them and a whole bunch of stuff,

216
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.670
like we're all dealing with this. And if there was ever a time,

217
00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:20.110
you needed to sit around the table and hash some stuff out. It's like,

218
00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.730
now's the time to do that.

219
00:12:21.731 --> 00:12:24.490
And I'm also seeing all these think pieces in the New York times and these other

220
00:12:24.491 --> 00:12:28.690
places about how to, how to avoid talks at Thanksgiving.

221
00:12:28.691 --> 00:12:31.360
And don't talk about politics and blah, blah, blah. And it's like, well,

222
00:12:31.361 --> 00:12:34.060
you guys have made politics or religion. My family,

223
00:12:34.061 --> 00:12:37.300
I write about this in my book. I mean, we grew up arguing about politics at the,

224
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.360
at the table, but it was always civil. And then at the end,

225
00:12:40.361 --> 00:12:43.450
dessert was served and everybody was fine. We could use more of that.

226
00:12:43.451 --> 00:12:45.060
We could use more face to face talks.

227
00:12:45.061 --> 00:12:48.220
So we'll just leave all of our communication to Twitter. Cause that,

228
00:12:48.221 --> 00:12:50.740
that seems like it will be sane. So anyway,

229
00:12:50.741 --> 00:12:53.050
do what you think is right for you and your family.

230
00:12:53.051 --> 00:12:56.530
And I have a feeling that everything will be okay. Uh,

231
00:12:56.560 --> 00:13:01.180
but let's talk about our deeply corrupt and uh, potentially at this point,

232
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.420
state run media because I saw these two clips yesterday,

233
00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.400
one's from NBC and one's for ABC.

234
00:13:06.401 --> 00:13:11.290
And I think you'll find a language that the two anchors use in this

235
00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:14.380
case, it's Martha Raddatz at ABC.

236
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.540
And it is a Andrea Mitchell at NBC. There,

237
00:13:18.541 --> 00:13:23.350
there's an interesting choice of words and the way they frame these new

238
00:13:23.351 --> 00:13:26.110
Biden administration picks. And I think you're going to see, well,

239
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.400
it goes without saying, uh,

240
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:30.580
they're treating this a little bit differently than they treated the previous

241
00:13:30.581 --> 00:13:33.940
administration, but let's, let's do Andrea Mitchell first.

242
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:38.770
Let's listen to Andrea Mitchell discussing Biden's new administration

243
00:13:38.771 --> 00:13:39.610
picks his captain.

244
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.010
<v 2>Uh, they are now being told that it is not going to be political.</v>

245
00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.350
And Joe Biden is saying, these are people.

246
00:13:46.351 --> 00:13:50.640
This is a team who's going to tell me this team will tell me what I need to know

247
00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.850
what, not what I want to know. That is a big change.

248
00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:00.000
<v 1>All right. That's just one little bite there. And I guess, uh, on surface value,</v>

249
00:14:00.001 --> 00:14:03.420
if you just listen to it, it doesn't sound that bad, but if you unpack it,

250
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:05.640
those 12 or 15 words, she said,

251
00:14:05.641 --> 00:14:09.840
it does sound a little worse because they're not going to be political. That is,

252
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.690
that is rather incredible. The president of the United States,

253
00:14:12.691 --> 00:14:16.650
the incoming president of the United States is putting people in his

254
00:14:16.651 --> 00:14:18.510
administration who are not political.

255
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.750
Although their jobs are completely political.

256
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:26.730
These are political positions chosen by a politician to

257
00:14:26.731 --> 00:14:30.660
figure out the political laws that we will live under.

258
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.770
You see why this is silly, but these people, it's not going to be like Trump.

259
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.330
They're not going to tell him what he wants to hear.

260
00:14:36.331 --> 00:14:39.750
They're going to tell him the truth, but orange man bad did it the other way.

261
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:43.440
And not only that, but they're not even political.

262
00:14:43.441 --> 00:14:45.150
These people they're gods,

263
00:14:45.151 --> 00:14:49.860
they're just benevolent public servants who live to serve and they have no

264
00:14:49.861 --> 00:14:53.720
political beliefs and they're above it all in there working for Joe Biden.

265
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:58.400
It's so wonderful. And if you think that's odd now, watch ABC's Martha Raddatz.

266
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.260
<v 2>It's about the least flashy team you could possibly get.</v>

267
00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:05.410
They are deeply experienced. Uh,

268
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.640
they are humble and they are life long public servants.

269
00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.970
When I look at that group up there and let's put John Kerry aside,

270
00:15:12.971 --> 00:15:16.060
because as we know, he was the democratic nominee for president once,

271
00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:20.050
but they are not political. They are just career people.

272
00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:24.490
They have worked together for many years. I remember Jake Sullivan at the,

273
00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:28.900
at the side of Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state all the time.

274
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:33.670
And as they say, they really do reflect America.

275
00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:38.320
<v 1>Oh, Raddatz, Raddatz, your beat,</v>

276
00:15:38.321 --> 00:15:40.750
Andrea Mitchell there with so much nonsense.

277
00:15:40.751 --> 00:15:44.950
And so little time deeply experienced, humble,

278
00:15:44.951 --> 00:15:48.130
lifelong public servants. And guess what, guys,

279
00:15:48.131 --> 00:15:51.040
you're not going to believe this. They're not political.

280
00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.080
They're not political people.

281
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:57.250
They're being chosen to do jobs that are purely political things, right?

282
00:15:57.251 --> 00:16:01.510
They're not in the private sector, they're in the public sector.

283
00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:02.770
They didn't earn these jobs.

284
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:07.330
They're being selected for these jobs by the guy that is the supposedly incoming

285
00:16:07.331 --> 00:16:09.430
president. But these people are not political.

286
00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:13.960
They're also humble and decent and good. And it's just also wonderful.

287
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:15.880
She goes on to say that Jake Sullivan,

288
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:18.730
this guy he's so good and humble and not political,

289
00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:22.960
that he was always next to Hillary Clinton. When she was secretary of state,

290
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:24.880
I guess she was political at secretary of state.

291
00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:27.850
The guy that was right next to her the entire time he was completely apolitical.

292
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.450
Anyway, you see why this is just nonsense.

293
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.440
This is what state run media sounds like. It really is. It is.

294
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.120
It's a white washing of truth.

295
00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:41.980
They lie to your face in a way that kind of makes you feel good about, Oh,

296
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.940
the new people. Aren't going to be political and they'll be in charge.

297
00:16:45.941 --> 00:16:47.830
And they're just humble public servants.

298
00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:51.820
They're not like those evil mean Republicans who do everything for politics and

299
00:16:51.821 --> 00:16:54.670
who are mean, and these are humble people.

300
00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.860
They live on farms and it's like, it's,

301
00:16:57.861 --> 00:17:02.800
it's such Epic nonsense. And I suspect I don't watch a lot of,

302
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:04.990
uh, Chinese TV. Uh,

303
00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:09.520
but I suspect that if you were to hear about the way that

304
00:17:09.521 --> 00:17:13.000
Chinese TV fawns over Chinese politicians,

305
00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.040
I'm going to guess it's something like that.

306
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.580
And what you need to understand is that, and prove me wrong. Andrea Mitchell,

307
00:17:18.581 --> 00:17:23.290
if you're watching Andrea Mitchell is a Democrat and Martha Raddatz proved me

308
00:17:23.291 --> 00:17:23.530
wrong.

309
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:28.150
If you're watching Martha Raddatz is a Democrat and all of the people that you

310
00:17:28.151 --> 00:17:31.720
get your mainstream news from are Democrats.

311
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:36.280
It just is. As I said the other day, do you think Wolf Blitzer, Jake Tapper,

312
00:17:36.281 --> 00:17:41.200
Don lemon, Chris Cuomo, Brian Stelter, the entire lineup at CNN.

313
00:17:41.201 --> 00:17:44.050
Are they all Democrats? Of course they are. Now people will say to me, but Dave,

314
00:17:44.051 --> 00:17:48.260
what about Fox news? Yes. Fox is there first off, they're telling you that,

315
00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:52.290
that does anyone Tucker Carlson hide what he is to Sean Hannity,

316
00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:54.000
hide what he is by the way. Those,

317
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:57.750
those are on the opinion side of things where CNN does just a much worse job of

318
00:17:57.751 --> 00:18:01.540
blending, a news and opinion. It's like a CNN is Don lemon,

319
00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.720
limited news guy or an opinion guy. But anyway,

320
00:18:03.721 --> 00:18:08.430
the point is we are going to seek so much of this sort of

321
00:18:08.431 --> 00:18:12.750
thing where it'll, everything will be juxtaposed for four years.

322
00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:15.420
This is assuming Biden becomes president.

323
00:18:15.421 --> 00:18:17.340
And I'm still not sure that's going to happen. Uh,

324
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:20.820
but for four years we saw people who always said yes,

325
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:23.670
and they were corrupt and they only were out for themselves.

326
00:18:23.671 --> 00:18:28.380
And now we have angels who live for you. The people you see,

327
00:18:28.381 --> 00:18:32.910
because they are the ones who are here for you. They're not political.

328
00:18:32.911 --> 00:18:37.830
They're wonderful, magical unicorn like creatures. Oh,

329
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.410
Lordy, Lordy people. Our work is cut out for us. All right,

330
00:18:40.411 --> 00:18:44.190
let's move on to story. Number three, this is really incredible. I, I saw this.

331
00:18:44.191 --> 00:18:48.930
This is, this is absolutely staggeringly, incredible. Oh.

332
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.710
And I should reference actually that one of the things from the previous story,

333
00:18:52.711 --> 00:18:57.240
because it blends us right into this so perfectly is that she also mentions

334
00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:02.040
Martha Raddatz and the previous thing she mentions, um, John Kerry right now,

335
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.830
John Kerry, who was secretary of state under Obama, did nothing.

336
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:08.730
John Kerry has never accomplished anything. He, he lost as president, you know,

337
00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:13.020
the nominee, uh, years ago. Uh, he did that against George W. Bush,

338
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:16.260
but he's never really accomplished anything other than he married a Heinz,

339
00:19:16.261 --> 00:19:19.920
right? So he's got great access to catch up. If you need up,

340
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:24.240
you go to John Kerry and also he's had a tremendous amount of Botox.

341
00:19:24.241 --> 00:19:28.920
So if you need Botox advice or you need access to large quantities of

342
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.350
catch-up, you should talk to John Kerry. But besides that,

343
00:19:31.351 --> 00:19:34.860
he's never done anything good. He's never really accomplished anything.

344
00:19:34.861 --> 00:19:38.160
And as a matter of fact, there's an incredible video. Uh,

345
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:40.350
maybe we'll play it for you next week. We should have grabbed it for today.

346
00:19:40.351 --> 00:19:43.770
There's an incredible video of a couple of years ago where John Kerry is going

347
00:19:43.771 --> 00:19:46.170
on and on and on about middle East peace.

348
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.720
And it must be done with the Israelis and Palestinians first,

349
00:19:48.721 --> 00:19:50.670
you can't go to these other countries first.

350
00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.340
And literally everything he said is wrong.

351
00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:57.480
Everything is he has said is proven wrong as all of these peace deals come.

352
00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.960
And there has been no war in essence in the last four years and everything else.

353
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:06.090
I mentioned all of that because now our next story is this is Avi Berkowitz who

354
00:20:06.091 --> 00:20:10.890
works for the Trump campaign and was a part of a longer Jared Christian or a

355
00:20:10.891 --> 00:20:11.970
couple of other people, uh,

356
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.870
helping push these deals with the United Arab Emirates and with Sudan.

357
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:20.640
And we're seeing some really amazing things happen. So obvi posted this video,

358
00:20:20.641 --> 00:20:24.270
this is from the United Arab Emirates and it's, it's truly staggering.

359
00:20:24.570 --> 00:20:27.060
And yet I'm guessing you didn't see this on mainstream media.

360
00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:32.270
<v 3>Okay. Friends, you have to see that right now.</v>

361
00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:36.860
I mean the middle of the fresh fruits and vegetables market in

362
00:20:36.861 --> 00:20:39.590
Dubai, the United, uh, in the rights,

363
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:43.580
see what they put in front of the store,

364
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:48.580
the flag of Israel, the flag of the UAE together, uh, from roots.

365
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.390
But wait until you see that

366
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:56.590
you can see,

367
00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:02.770
they put Israeli product C with the flag of Israel on it.

368
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.500
You can buy oranges and avocado and

369
00:21:08.501 --> 00:21:10.450
other stuff with the flag of Israel.

370
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:14.860
I'm just thinking about all these BDS activists who want to boycott Israel,

371
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.760
uh, from UVA, from United States,

372
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:24.070
and to see an out of country who is giving the answer

373
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:29.230
by bringing Israeli products with, uh, uh, with,

374
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:33.820
uh, Israeli flags, wait,

375
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:38.140
we'll see the avocado and the dates,

376
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:43.450
and to see the people that are coming in buying and it's in the front of the

377
00:21:43.451 --> 00:21:47.260
store, not on the backstage, in the front of the store.

378
00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:52.450
That's the answer that our country is given to all

379
00:21:52.451 --> 00:21:55.510
these BDS activists around the world. Who's calling to,

380
00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:00.820
we're calling to boycott Israel. This is the answer guys you want, uh,

381
00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:03.190
you want to buy oranges, just come,

382
00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:06.220
come to the United Arab Emirates to buy it

383
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.750
amazing, complete.

384
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.460
<v 1>That's how you make peace. Guys.</v>

385
00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:19.260
You make peace by having these exchanges of commerce by trading embassies

386
00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:21.150
and ambassadors and things like that.

387
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:23.340
This is completely against what John Kerry said.

388
00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:25.800
It's completely against what all the experts have said over the years,

389
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:29.820
by the way, the same exact experts who are now all being imported into the Biden

390
00:22:29.821 --> 00:22:32.340
administration. So I thought it was just worth showing that, I mean,

391
00:22:32.341 --> 00:22:34.740
the idea that it, an Arab market,

392
00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:38.130
that they wouldn't have the Israeli flag there with the Jewish star and the

393
00:22:38.131 --> 00:22:42.180
whole thing that nobody's burning it down. There's no buddy attacking anything.

394
00:22:42.181 --> 00:22:45.330
Nobody vandalizing anything. That's the seeds of peace.

395
00:22:45.331 --> 00:22:48.810
I know this is very upsetting to Ilhan Omar and Rashida to leave, but yeah,

396
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.550
peace, peace can happen. People.

397
00:22:50.551 --> 00:22:53.070
It actually kind of happened and it's happening right in front of our faces.

398
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:57.780
And hopefully, um, well hopefully we're not just going to throw it away, uh,

399
00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:01.650
with whatever happens over the next couple of years. Um, Oh, you know,

400
00:23:01.651 --> 00:23:04.560
before I get to our final story about Thanksgiving, which, uh,

401
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.990
which is an important one, I realized that in my,

402
00:23:06.991 --> 00:23:11.700
in my ability to Blasio bit about locking down the city and the checkpoints and

403
00:23:11.701 --> 00:23:12.031
everything,

404
00:23:12.031 --> 00:23:16.720
I wanted to put a particularly special message out there to build a buzzy.

405
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.440
Because yesterday I put a very personal,

406
00:23:19.441 --> 00:23:23.580
important message out there to, uh, to Gavin Newsome.

407
00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.520
And many of you were very excited about it was it's important.

408
00:23:26.521 --> 00:23:30.600
A lot of people shared it. Uh, so I do want to put a message out there to,

409
00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.250
to build a Blasio. So here we go,

410
00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:38.550
build a Blasio mayor of New York city. Well,

411
00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:43.710
this message goes out to you. And I want to be very careful with my words here.

412
00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.520
So bill de Blasio.

413
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:50.300
<v 4>Go yourself.</v>

414
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:59.570
One more time. Bill de Blasio,

415
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:03.350
go yourself.

416
00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:05.050
<v 1>All right. I felt good about that.</v>

417
00:24:05.051 --> 00:24:08.170
Now let's move on to Thanksgiving people because I know you're going to

418
00:24:08.171 --> 00:24:11.380
celebrate it in the ultimate act of defiance. You might hug people.

419
00:24:11.381 --> 00:24:15.880
You might kiss people. You might sing with people. Well, Oregon, governor,

420
00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.040
Kate Brown, she doesn't want you doing any of that.

421
00:24:18.041 --> 00:24:22.450
She wants you to sit home alone miserably, as I assume she will.

422
00:24:22.451 --> 00:24:27.160
Although if you find out that she doesn't and you see her leaving her house, or,

423
00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:30.820
you know, doing anything publicly on Thanksgiving, if you take a picture of it,

424
00:24:30.821 --> 00:24:33.820
as long as you don't break any law, I'll give you 500 bucks for it. Well,

425
00:24:33.821 --> 00:24:37.360
she posted this video on her Twitter account today.

426
00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:12.010
<v 4>[Inaudible] Oregon. Governor Kate Brown,</v>

427
00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:15.550
go yourself.

428
00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:21.370
<v 1>We're onto something here. I really do look forget Kate Brown,</v>

429
00:25:21.371 --> 00:25:23.950
forget everything else I wanted to just give you a little, uh,

430
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.150
Thanksgiving message,

431
00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:29.800
which is that I hope that whatever you're doing that it makes you happy that it

432
00:25:29.801 --> 00:25:34.180
gives you some joy. I hope you're going to eat great food and drink great wine.

433
00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:37.000
I hope you're going to be around people that you love.

434
00:25:37.001 --> 00:25:41.620
I hope you're going to escape politics for a moment and just enjoy yourself and

435
00:25:41.621 --> 00:25:46.510
be thankful for the spectacularly wonderful freedoms that

436
00:25:46.511 --> 00:25:50.320
we still have in America that are tenuous freedoms at best,

437
00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:52.930
because they feel like they're being eroded right now,

438
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:57.100
but it is up to us to protect those freedoms and fight for those freedoms.

439
00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.880
And perhaps more than anything else, just personally for me,

440
00:26:00.881 --> 00:26:04.030
I want to thank you. Uh, people watching this,

441
00:26:04.031 --> 00:26:05.740
every single person watching this,

442
00:26:05.741 --> 00:26:10.600
you have given me an ability to do what I believe has given me

443
00:26:10.601 --> 00:26:14.050
purpose and, and joy and happiness in this world.

444
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:17.280
And I love doing what I'm doing. And I think in some ways I've,

445
00:26:17.281 --> 00:26:21.760
I've perhaps helped some of you figure out what you think of this mess too.

446
00:26:21.761 --> 00:26:25.690
So it's a, it's an even exchange man. We're, we're good. And, uh,

447
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:30.370
I'm just so thankful for all of you and for my team here and for living in this

448
00:26:30.371 --> 00:26:32.950
great country and I'm going to keep fighting for it. And I hope you will,

449
00:26:32.951 --> 00:26:37.720
as well. And as I said, no show tomorrow, no show Friday, enjoy the weekend.

450
00:26:37.721 --> 00:26:42.040
Have a great time. Eat lots of food, gain a couple pounds, drink, lots of booze,

451
00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.700
whatever you want to do, you want to smoke a little something? It's all good.

452
00:26:45.701 --> 00:26:49.900
This is America, baby. All right, thanks everybody. Enjoy your Thanksgiving.

453
00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.100
And I'll see you next time.
