1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.850
<v 0>It's an act of tremendous cowardice, in my opinion, um,</v>

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.720
for people not to realize that even in times of a pandemic, uh,

3
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:08.580
we still have to have our basic freedoms,

4
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.130
the freedom for if you are an individual.

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.620
And you think that COVID-19 is the bubonic plague.

6
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.690
You should have the freedom to be able to decide,

7
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:18.630
to stay at home and lock yourself in a basement in order, you know,

8
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:20.880
seamless and Instacart, if that's what you want to do.

9
00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:24.030
But you should also allow me to have the freedom to open my business and to say,

10
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.300
you'd like to come into my business. Um, you know, I'd love to host you here.

11
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.220
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

12
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.290
<v 2>I'm Dave Rubin, and this is the Rubin report.</v>

13
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.150
I originally interviewed Candace Owens on March 12th to discuss her new book

14
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.480
blackout. But as we recorded news of COVID related,

15
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.620
lockdowns began and suddenly the news cycle totally shifted. Now,

16
00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:49.850
six months later,

17
00:00:49.851 --> 00:00:54.260
we're picking up the conversation and then releasing the original conversation

18
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.770
unedited along with the new pickup we're doing right now,

19
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.830
most guests would never allow an interview to sit for so long.

20
00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:03.410
But if I can say one thing about Candace Owens,

21
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.560
it's that she's a woman of her words, Candice,

22
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.190
we shot that interview. It seems like a lifetime ago,

23
00:01:10.191 --> 00:01:11.900
but it was March 12th.

24
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.770
And it basically was the day that the lockdowns were beginning.

25
00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:20.330
And the second we stepped out of the studio, your assistant, my whole team,

26
00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:23.840
everyone's telling us we're freaking out. You guys had to get out of LA,

27
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.800
but you are a woman true to your word even now, six months later.

28
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.880
Cause you were like, ah, I don't think this is anything. This is nonsense.

29
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:35.630
They're trying to take Trump out. And from everything I know of you since then,

30
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.190
you, you have consistently put that message out there. Um, so first off,

31
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.380
how are you haven't seen in a while? How are you doing?

32
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.740
<v 0>I'm doing well? I think it's also important that I break the story here.</v>

33
00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:48.980
That on that day, uh, the morning I woke up at my hotel,

34
00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:53.960
I had an allergic reaction to a feathered pillows lease was scratchy and

35
00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:58.670
I had a cold and I came in and Dave and his husband did not believe that I had

36
00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:03.200
had an allergic reaction and they thought I was COVID-19.

37
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.770
<v 2>And just that you had an allergic reaction, you came in,</v>

38
00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:11.210
you were coughing and sneezing. The news is breaking all over the world.

39
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.910
And, and you were telling us that you had blood,

40
00:02:16.911 --> 00:02:20.240
that you were coughing blood earlier in the morning, and then you're like, Oh,

41
00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:23.570
you don't mind if I work from your house all day, do you, and what did I do?

42
00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:26.960
What does a real friend do? You did? And we even fed you.

43
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.390
<v 0>Yes, but that is what feather pillows do to me.</v>

44
00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:31.670
I have the strangest allergy with feathered pillows.

45
00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:34.700
And if I sleep on what I wake up and I will literally be coughing blood,

46
00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:36.560
but the timing I will give you credit,

47
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.000
it was just bad timing with COVID-19 stuff freaking out. So.

48
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.710
<v 2>How bad would,</v>

49
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.930
would Vox love it if Candace Owens was patient zero on

50
00:02:47.931 --> 00:02:49.580
COVID-19. I mean, come on.

51
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.830
<v 0>She would have loved it so much.</v>

52
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.220
<v 2>They would have loved it. All right. So listen, I said to you,</v>

53
00:02:55.221 --> 00:02:56.090
before we did this,

54
00:02:56.091 --> 00:02:59.230
that I wanted to do a pickup with you because it does feel like a totally

55
00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:02.260
different world in just six months, it feels so different,

56
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.730
but we are going to air that interview. Totally unedited just as it was. Um,

57
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.370
but I thought it was worth talking for another half hour or so.

58
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:12.460
Just about what has gone on for the last six months,

59
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:16.660
if any of that has changed your, your feelings on anything or anything else.

60
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.450
So first off you, you are in DC, uh,

61
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.900
you've become a creature of the swamp somehow. Um,

62
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.220
what's life like in DC, how has COVID effected you? And, and, you know,

63
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:29.470
you're pretty outspoken about this stuff, but are you,

64
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.580
are you okay with any level of lockdowns, any level of masks, anything.

65
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.240
<v 0>I'm not okay with any of it? You know,</v>

66
00:03:36.241 --> 00:03:39.450
I think it's very easy when people are scared, um,

67
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.210
to convince them to give up their freedoms. And we saw that. I mean,

68
00:03:42.211 --> 00:03:45.150
people hardcore, conservative suddenly like, yes,

69
00:03:45.151 --> 00:03:48.390
we should all be locked down for businesses to close. Um,

70
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.450
and it's an act of tremendous cowardice in my opinion, um,

71
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.320
for people not to realize that even in times of a pandemic, uh,

72
00:03:55.321 --> 00:03:57.180
we still have to have our basic freedoms,

73
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.730
the freedom for if you are an individual.

74
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.280
And you think that COVID-19 is the bubonic plague.

75
00:04:02.281 --> 00:04:05.580
You should have the freedom to be able to decide to stay at home and lock

76
00:04:05.581 --> 00:04:08.460
yourself in a basement in order, you know, seamless and Instacart,

77
00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:09.480
if that's what you want to do.

78
00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:12.630
But you should also allow me to have the freedom to open my business and to say,

79
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.900
if you'd like to come into my business, um, you know, I'd love to host you here.

80
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.320
Um, that's that freedom doesn't go away because of a pandemic.

81
00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:21.840
And I think people sort of lost the thread on that because they were so

82
00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:22.980
terrified. You know,

83
00:04:22.981 --> 00:04:26.070
now people have obviously shifted their opinions and where people are on my

84
00:04:26.071 --> 00:04:26.461
side.

85
00:04:26.461 --> 00:04:31.380
I tend to take a very bold and strong opinion early on when people are unsure.

86
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.130
Um,

87
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.360
but to me it was the entire coronavirus narrative was just too perfect and too

88
00:04:36.361 --> 00:04:39.630
timely, uh, in an election cycle, uh, we have to force,

89
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.280
we have to shut down the economy.

90
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.450
We had to put everybody on welfare and give them stimulus checks. And you know,

91
00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:46.950
nobody, nobody can leave their home.

92
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.280
So they have to rely on the mainstream media narrative because they can't go out

93
00:04:50.281 --> 00:04:53.310
and have experiences with their friends that would make them say, you know what?

94
00:04:53.311 --> 00:04:54.270
Maybe, um,

95
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.600
it's not as scary as it is as I've been out to a party a few times and I haven't

96
00:04:57.601 --> 00:05:00.220
gotten the illness, so I never trusted it. Uh,

97
00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:02.310
of course I think coronavirus is real. Um,

98
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.760
what I was questioning was the idea that it was some plague,

99
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.670
like thing that was going to take us all out if we stepped outside of our door.

100
00:05:08.671 --> 00:05:11.280
And I really thought it was about mail-in voting from, from day one.

101
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.520
<v 2>Yeah. And by the way, you were taking it from both sides,</v>

102
00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:16.020
you kind of touch on this because you were,

103
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.070
you were given it to conservatives who were all about a lockdown suddenly and,

104
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.880
and you know, government overreach, let's say. And then I saw like this,

105
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.730
the usual suspects, the lefty blue check people,

106
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.060
because you dared to go to whole foods without a mask.

107
00:05:30.061 --> 00:05:33.690
And then there were several blue check people that blood is on your hands.

108
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.840
Candice, how many people have you killed? How many.

109
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.650
<v 0>Apparently times for going to whole foods, they were like, well,</v>

110
00:05:40.651 --> 00:05:44.550
how could you possibly say, she goes to whole foods every day and I'm like,

111
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.680
look, I can't go anywhere because you shut down.

112
00:05:46.681 --> 00:05:49.140
All of my events happen to live near a whole foods.

113
00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:53.040
And I like to look at what they have at the meat counter every day. Um, so,

114
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.220
you know, I, you know, at the time during COVID lockdowns,

115
00:05:56.221 --> 00:06:00.650
I was early in my pregnancy. So, um, I am an asthmatic,

116
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:04.550
so I have pre-existing conditions. And I ended up deciding to travel the world,

117
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.310
uh, because I was that convinced of how untrue narrative was.

118
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:10.760
And I was shocked to discover the second you step outside of America,

119
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:13.820
you realize we're the only ones playing the crazy game. And I was in England,

120
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:15.830
there were no mass mandates. I went to Croatia.

121
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.970
They have no idea that there's even a Krone coronavirus going on.

122
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.800
The kids are running around really no mask, no social distancing. Um, so it,

123
00:06:23.801 --> 00:06:26.390
it just felt to me, especially when I got home,

124
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:29.810
because I had those experiences and it was really being manufactured for

125
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:30.644
Americans.

126
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.661
<v 2>All right.</v>

127
00:06:31.661 --> 00:06:36.190
So I want to ask a question that I think cuts to the heart of the Candace Owens

128
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.310
that I know, but is also the public Candice owns,

129
00:06:39.311 --> 00:06:43.450
which is those first few days when everyone was freaking out,

130
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.800
when everyone is really freaking out and you just took that position of this is

131
00:06:47.801 --> 00:06:51.950
BS, this is nonsense, all of that stuff. What is it about you I've,

132
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:53.980
I've asked you some version of this before,

133
00:06:53.981 --> 00:06:56.410
because I even remember seeing your tweets right at the beginning.

134
00:06:56.411 --> 00:06:59.530
And I was kinda like, Oh, Candace, like,

135
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.080
you might really be stepping in it right now. You know,

136
00:07:02.081 --> 00:07:05.080
if a week later it turns out that, you know,

137
00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.890
half of us have this thing or everyone over 60 is dead,

138
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.350
but what is it about you that you just do it?

139
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.040
You just get the thought and you're just like, I'm rolling.

140
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.530
<v 0>You know, I think I have very good gut instinct. Um, I, I, I have,</v>

141
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:23.980
I just always really trusted my gut, um, on certain things. And,

142
00:07:23.981 --> 00:07:26.020
and like I said, it was, it was too perfect.

143
00:07:26.021 --> 00:07:30.040
And usually if something seems too perfect, it's because it's too perfect. Um,

144
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.250
and it was just also all of the media at the death.

145
00:07:33.251 --> 00:07:36.760
Ticker was very strange to me like that. We've never done that before. I mean,

146
00:07:36.761 --> 00:07:41.220
if, if CNN MSNBC did a death ticker for every time, there was a car accident,

147
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:42.790
you'd be terrified to get in your car.

148
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.180
So I was already seeing that there was a psychological element that the media

149
00:07:46.181 --> 00:07:47.260
was playing because there was,

150
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.750
it was just very bizarre to see a death ticker for anything, of course,

151
00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:52.510
you're way more likely to get into your car and get into an accident in LA,

152
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.790
but they would never do that. Um, and,

153
00:07:54.791 --> 00:07:59.230
and so I really felt that it was just too easy for them to get into the minds of

154
00:07:59.231 --> 00:08:03.850
so many people. And I'm so crazy about not being brainwashed. And, um, it just,

155
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.700
none of it made sense to me at all. It just, it just from start to finish,

156
00:08:06.701 --> 00:08:07.840
never thought it made any sense.

157
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:11.470
<v 2>You're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics</v>
