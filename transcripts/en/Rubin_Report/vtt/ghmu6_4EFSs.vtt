1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.210
<v 0>Sure. So look, you know, we're,</v>

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.000
we're living through probably the biggest medical scandal today is that there's

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:10.890
a sudden spike and these teenage girls out of nowhere, medically transitioning,

4
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.860
all of a sudden they want hormones and surgeries and they're easily obtaining

5
00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:15.510
them. And, um,

6
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.430
I wrote a book about it and because two Twitter users decided the

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.470
book was transphobic. Um,

8
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.500
they told that they called it that to target target removed it.

9
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.410
[inaudible].

10
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.861
<v 1>Dave Rubin.</v>

11
00:00:33.861 --> 00:00:38.120
And this is the Rubin report joining me today for a long overdue interview is

12
00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:43.070
author of the new book, irreversible damage, the transgender craze,

13
00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:47.300
seducing our daughters, Abigail Shrier, welcome to the Rubin report.

14
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.310
<v 0>Thanks so much for having me on.</v>

15
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.290
<v 1>So the book came out in June and kind of caught fire in June,</v>

16
00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:58.340
and then I was going to have you on in August. And I went off the grid and then,

17
00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:01.280
you know, there was election stuff, so I didn't have Yon.

18
00:01:01.281 --> 00:01:03.140
And then a couple of weeks ago,

19
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.090
all hell broke loose because target tweeted that they were going to no

20
00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:10.070
longer carry the book.

21
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:13.640
So let's just start with the controversy because actually the reason I'm having

22
00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:17.180
you on right now is that after the controversy, uh,

23
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.230
the book absolutely sold out everywhere and we had to hold this interview so

24
00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:23.660
that the book would be stocked again. So a lot's going on.

25
00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:25.910
So let's just start with the controversy first,

26
00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:30.590
because what you write about here and the transgender craze is really

27
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:34.880
like the hot topic of the day and the thing that seems to get the most people in

28
00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:37.070
hot water. So what happened with target? Let's start there.

29
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.600
<v 0>Sure. So look, you know, we're,</v>

30
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:43.430
we're living through probably the biggest medical scandal today is that there's

31
00:01:43.431 --> 00:01:48.320
a sudden spike and these teenage girls out of nowhere, medically transitioning,

32
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.260
all of a sudden they want hormones and surgeries and they're easily obtaining

33
00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:52.940
them. And, um,

34
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.860
I wrote a book about it and because two Twitter users decided the

35
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.350
book was transphobic. Um, they told that they called it that to target, target,

36
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.060
removed it. And people were very upset. You know,

37
00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:06.860
the book has a lot of grassroots support.

38
00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:11.120
A lot of parents feel like it really explained the story of what happened to

39
00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:13.280
them when they're teenagers suddenly out of the blue,

40
00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:16.670
decided with their friends that they were transgender. And, um,

41
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.600
they were really upset and a lot of people wrote to target and target, you know,

42
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.270
reinstated it. It was you, uh, you know,

43
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.870
one of the few victories I think against cancel culture.

44
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.191
<v 1>Yeah. You,</v>

45
00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:31.580
must've been pretty enthused to see the amount of support that you got because

46
00:02:31.581 --> 00:02:31.791
yeah,

47
00:02:31.791 --> 00:02:36.080
you get the usual Twitter haters and the anonymous accounts and all that stuff,

48
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.290
you know, pushing target to a decision like this. But,

49
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.850
but pretty much everybody that still stands on the side of free speech.

50
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:45.200
I guess we don't have that many people anymore,

51
00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:48.920
but pretty much everyone that was around supported you to get this thing back.

52
00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:49.850
And it actually did work.

53
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.880
<v 0>Yeah. I was very gratified. Look, you know,</v>

54
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.810
there are literally hundreds of books out there promoting

55
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.390
unskeptical early, the immediate medical transition of teenagers.

56
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.060
If you want to read that book, there are hundreds you could read. And,

57
00:03:05.061 --> 00:03:06.460
and you know what I, you know,

58
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.970
I certainly would never call for any of them to be banned because I don't want

59
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:12.100
to live in that kind of world. But you know,

60
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:16.480
there is exactly one book that did a deep dive into this phenomenon of teenage

61
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:20.590
girls suddenly transitioning. And it's my book and for the activists,

62
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.570
even one book is too many.

63
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.360
<v 1>Yeah. Okay. So let's start with the most important converse question.</v>

64
00:03:27.361 --> 00:03:32.130
Let's just get it out there, right from the top. Abigail, are you a transphobia?

65
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.790
Do you have an irrational fear of trans people?

66
00:03:35.791 --> 00:03:37.320
And is that why you wrote this book?

67
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.690
<v 0>No, I wrote the book, first of all,</v>

68
00:03:39.691 --> 00:03:42.720
because a reader wrote to me and she told me her daughter had gone through this

69
00:03:42.721 --> 00:03:45.600
phenomenon. And when she, um, you know,

70
00:03:45.601 --> 00:03:49.410
she said her daughter had always been a girly girl, never had gender dysphoria.

71
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.530
This is, um, severe discomfort in one's biological sex.

72
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.420
But when she got to high school,

73
00:03:54.421 --> 00:03:57.690
she had a lot of mental health issues and she went off to college and with a

74
00:03:57.691 --> 00:04:00.180
group of girlfriends, they all decided they were transgender.

75
00:04:00.181 --> 00:04:02.610
And she started a course of testosterone.

76
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.510
And I tried to find another investigative journalist who would take it up

77
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.560
because I had, you know,

78
00:04:07.561 --> 00:04:10.170
I wasn't an investigative journalist and I couldn't find one.

79
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.980
So after four months I finally got back in touch with her and I said, all right,

80
00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:17.400
I'll do it. I mean, that's, that's the world we're living in. And,

81
00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:20.490
and let me just say that a lot of transgender adults and I interviewed a lot for

82
00:04:20.491 --> 00:04:23.550
my book support the book. I mean, the book does not,

83
00:04:23.551 --> 00:04:25.470
I'm not against medical transition.

84
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.400
It just urges caution when it comes to these teenage girls.

85
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.690
<v 1>So just to be absolutely clear, and I know my audience totally understands it,</v>

86
00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:38.310
but so you don't have a problem with adults that transition that make

87
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.890
the choice in their lives to transition?

88
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.800
<v 0>No, I mean, not only am I not against it,</v>

89
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.220
I've interviewed a lot of transgender adults. I believe it has helped, um,

90
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.850
trans it can help. Um, I know them,

91
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.840
like I talked to them and I'll tell you something else.

92
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.590
I'm not even against all medical transition for teenagers.

93
00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.630
The only thing I sh I show in the blog is that the current medical regime

94
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.940
has no medical judgment in place.

95
00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:05.490
It's totally based on the judgment of teenagers.

96
00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.670
And the doctors are told to affirm, affirm, affirm,

97
00:05:08.671 --> 00:05:10.710
meaning they have to agree with the teenager.

98
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.760
Self-diagnosis so there's no checks in place. So the regime,

99
00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:17.610
the current medical regime is really not safe for teenage girls.

100
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.900
<v 1>Yeah. So I was trying to think how I wanted to conduct this interview because,</v>

101
00:05:21.901 --> 00:05:24.960
you know, this is one of the topics that we've touched on a bunch here.

102
00:05:24.961 --> 00:05:29.880
Not because I particularly care about these issues as much as

103
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.300
when it's become such a hot button issue, then it sort of gets to my plate.

104
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.140
But I thought I read the book and I thought that the way that you laid it out,

105
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.060
uh, just even in the chapters,

106
00:05:39.061 --> 00:05:42.210
the way you separated certain things was really good. So if you don't mind,

107
00:05:42.211 --> 00:05:45.450
we'll just go through chapter by chapter and discuss each one.

108
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.930
So the introduction is about the contagion and that's sort of what you're

109
00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:52.320
hitting on about what happened with, uh, with your friend's daughter at college.

110
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.460
Can you, can you describe that?

111
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.230
<v 0>Sure. So, um,</v>

112
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.700
it's based on the research of Lisa as we'll talk about in the next chapter, but,

113
00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.180
um,

114
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.380
the public health researcher who looked into why there was a sudden huge spike

115
00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:06.680
in teenage girls who claimed to have gender dysphoria,

116
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.600
and this is not the population that traditionally had it, it was always males.

117
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:15.650
And it usually began in early childhood. And all of a sudden across the West,

118
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:16.730
including America,

119
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.650
we have this sudden spike of teenage girls deciding they're transgender often

120
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:25.490
with their friends and often after the encouragement of social media

121
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:26.330
influencers.

122
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.610
<v 1>Right? So you talk about this a little bit later in the book.</v>

123
00:06:30.611 --> 00:06:31.510
So I'm jumping ahead a bit,

124
00:06:31.511 --> 00:06:35.800
but you tell a story of a girl who in essence in high school came out as

125
00:06:35.801 --> 00:06:36.640
transgender. There,

126
00:06:36.641 --> 00:06:39.640
there weren't a lot of issues that she was bringing up before that,

127
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.880
but then suddenly she's getting more likes on tumbler.

128
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.810
She's now part of an oppressed minority at school and in different groups.

129
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.390
And that, that allure basically,

130
00:06:49.391 --> 00:06:51.070
and I know I'm getting a little ahead of ourselves here, but,

131
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.420
but that allure in a weird way is what's fueling so much of this.

132
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.230
<v 0>That's right? So it's young teenage girls. These are often white,</v>

133
00:06:59.231 --> 00:07:02.740
middle or upper middle class girls. They're very precocious. Um,

134
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.950
but they are high anxiety and high depression girls.

135
00:07:05.951 --> 00:07:09.070
They have a lot of mental health issues. And for the first time,

136
00:07:09.071 --> 00:07:12.580
the moment they get to high school and or middle school and decide they're

137
00:07:12.581 --> 00:07:14.260
transgender, you know,

138
00:07:14.261 --> 00:07:17.380
it's the first time they get so much encouragement and love,

139
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.250
especially online and sometimes from adults and,

140
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:25.630
and some of these adults are not, you know, are, are not up to very much good.

141
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:26.170
Um,

142
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:29.800
but they get the showering of love and praise and they don't want to walk away

143
00:07:29.801 --> 00:07:30.634
from that.

144
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.420
<v 1>So chapter one, which is about the girls that you're describing right there,</v>

145
00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:36.370
you know, we've talked a lot about it. And I think, you know,

146
00:07:36.371 --> 00:07:40.750
I was on tour with Jordan Peterson for a year and a half and he focused more.

147
00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:44.740
So I would say on young men, but it was a message that obviously traversed,

148
00:07:44.741 --> 00:07:46.750
it didn't matter what gender you really were,

149
00:07:46.751 --> 00:07:51.430
but is there something specific going on with young girls that we're

150
00:07:51.431 --> 00:07:52.420
not aware of?

151
00:07:52.421 --> 00:07:56.050
Like there does seem to be an a masculization of young boys that we see,

152
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.210
but what do you think is happening with young girls?

153
00:07:58.690 --> 00:07:59.111
<v 0>Right.</v>

154
00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:03.430
So teenage girls specifically fall for almost every one of these so-called as

155
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.750
stereos. And the reason they do is they tend to take on their friend's pain.

156
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:12.280
If a young man is depressed, very often, his friend will say, okay,

157
00:08:12.281 --> 00:08:17.110
let's go play basketball or, or suggest doing something. But he won't say,

158
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.600
what are you feeling? Tell me about your pain.

159
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.060
And he won't start to take it on himself.

160
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:26.590
He won't agree with his friend about how terrible life is just to make his

161
00:08:26.591 --> 00:08:28.360
friend feel better. But we know,

162
00:08:28.361 --> 00:08:31.960
and I interviewed a lot of psychologists about this young women tend to not only

163
00:08:31.961 --> 00:08:33.160
take on their friend's pain,
