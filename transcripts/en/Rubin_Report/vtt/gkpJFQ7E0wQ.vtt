00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.740
<v 0>You know, um, Donald Trump is not the caricature that they make him out to be.</v>

2
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:06.270
And, you know, I, I just, I, I,

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.020
there are certain little vignettes that I remember, you know, when,

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.110
when my kids would be, we'd go, we'd fly down to Florida.

5
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:16.390
We had a house in the first he had Mar-a-Lago. Um, and,

6
00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:19.350
and he would say very quietly to his kids.

7
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.070
Don't talk to her like that. You don't talk to your sister like that.

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.860
You don't talk to him like that never raised his voice. You know,

9
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:29.460
he was always serious. And then when he got a little more upset,

10
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:33.450
it would be no, no emotion. You just lost your allowance,

11
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.460
keep it up, keep it up.

12
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.800
He was always attentive to their behavior and how they acted toward each other.

13
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:46.910
[inaudible].

14
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.750
<v 1>So let's, let's back up for a second because, because you know, Trump and I,</v>

15
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.170
and a lot of my audience, you, you know,

16
00:00:51.171 --> 00:00:53.330
a bit about my political evolution and that I was,

17
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.570
I was a Bernie supporter and a progressive and a lefty and all those things.

18
00:00:56.571 --> 00:00:56.690
And.

19
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.090
<v 0>I you're good.</v>

20
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.230
<v 1>You're a pro you're a pro I should be judged accordingly for all of those</v>

21
00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:04.370
things. Um,

22
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.330
but I know that there's a lot of my audience that I would say they don't

23
00:01:08.331 --> 00:01:11.630
consider themselves conservative per se, or even on the right.

24
00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:15.680
But they consider themselves what I would say is sort of the disaffected

25
00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:20.360
liberal. And I think that is a huge, huge amount of people in America right now,

26
00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:23.510
the liberals that just can't believe how bananas the left has gone.

27
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.220
But I think the other piece of that is they just find something

28
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.690
about Trump. Off-putting whether it's the way he speaks or the tweeting or,

29
00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:33.920
or whatever, something like that.

30
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.280
So since you know him and you talk about it a little bit already, can you just,

31
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.300
if you wanted people to be more okay, that, that he does love this country,

32
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:44.990
that he's a decent guy and it took me a long time to get there, by the way,

33
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.290
I think I mentioned this on your show. It wasn't until I actually met him.

34
00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:53.030
And I had about 10 minutes to talk to him that I felt more. Okay. Um,

35
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.930
when he, when he literally turned to my husband and I, and he goes,

36
00:01:56.931 --> 00:01:59.000
you guys are gay. He goes, that's great.

37
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:01.280
Your only problem is you're too handsome. And I thought,

38
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:03.650
this is the guy who says, everyone's a home. You know, they,

39
00:02:03.651 --> 00:02:06.620
they say he thinks that he's a homophobe. Um,

40
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.310
but since you know him a little bit more, yeah. Can you.

41
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.900
<v 0>Dive into that? You know, um,</v>

42
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.040
Donald Trump is not the caricature that they make him out to be. And, you know,

43
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.480
I just, I, I, there are certain little vignettes that I remember, you know,

44
00:02:20.481 --> 00:02:23.900
when, when my kids would be, we'd go, we'd fly down to Florida.

45
00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:27.200
We had a house in the first, he had more Lago. Um, and,

46
00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:30.140
and he would say very quietly to his kids.

47
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.890
Don't talk to her like that. You don't talk to your sister like that.

48
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.650
You don't talk to him like that never raised his voice. You know,

49
00:02:36.651 --> 00:02:40.250
he was always serious. And then when he got a little more upset,

50
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:44.270
it would be no, no emotion. You just lost your allowance,

51
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.250
keep it up, keep it up.

52
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.620
He was always attentive to their behavior and how they acted toward each other.

53
00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:56.170
And, and I I'll never forget. It was, it was sort of the beginning of, of, of,

54
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.880
uh, school or, uh, no, the second semester, I guess. And he said, uh,

55
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:03.910
when we land, we're going to K-Mart to get our school supplies.

56
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:08.350
You said to the kids, and I'm like, Donald Trump goes that Kmart. Wow.

57
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.480
When we would walk down the street in Manhattan, we went out with him a lot. Um,

58
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.780
he was always kind to me, he would say to people, you know, this Janine Bureau,

59
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.970
she's the da, you know, from Westchester.

60
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:22.300
And I was always on television for something. And, um,

61
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.560
and he was always more, um, you know,

62
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.660
it was beholding and try and get people to recognize you. Instead of him,

63
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.370
whenever he saw a cop, whenever he saw a construction worker or a hard hat,

64
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.850
and they were all enamored with him, they were like, Oh, hi.

65
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:43.450
And then they didn't have phone cameras maybe back then, but they say,

66
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:46.090
can I shake your hand? He would absolutely do it.

67
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.900
Whenever we go into a restaurant and have dinner or something,

68
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.710
you'd March right into that kitchen and take care of everybody in the kitchen.

69
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.070
He is a good, generous man.

70
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.420
And his kids are a Testament to the success,

71
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.340
uh, that he instilled in them. Every one of them. I mean, those kids are smart.

72
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:10.810
They're successful. They're brilliant. They really are. And as a human being,

73
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.990
you know, you go through tough periods in your life or your career.

74
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.830
He was always there for me, or, you know, for my then husband,

75
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:21.700
he was always there, always generous in spirit,

76
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.650
loved his brother. Robert. I was at the white house for the, uh, uh,

77
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.130
for the week, uh, was very, very sad about that.

78
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.200
Uh, very family-oriented day. They were always together.

79
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.940
He was with his sisters and his brother, um, and never drank.

80
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.100
And I remember when I interviewed him in 2016, right before, um,

81
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.120
he ran, uh, it was, there was talk of him running. And I said,

82
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.000
you want to tell people you don't drink? He said, no, I don't drink,

83
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:54.640
never had a drink. And people were floored by that,

84
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:58.150
but I've seen him in parties all hours of the day and night go tomorrow,

85
00:04:58.151 --> 00:05:02.920
Lago everybody be, you know, half in the bag, not Donald Donald.

86
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.730
I love the guy. He's, he's a wonderful, wonderful man.

87
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.720
And he loves this country. And you know what? I don't know anyone, Dave,

88
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:15.640
who could take the assaults that he's taken on a daily basis and survive

89
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:19.270
them. The guy looks better than ever, usually after four years, you're,

90
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.640
you're exhausted. He's raring to go.

91
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.680
<v 1>I know he's, he's more bronze than usual now. It's, it's very,</v>

92
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.770
it must be because of peace in the middle East, it made him bronze or something.

93
00:05:28.771 --> 00:05:30.960
But, but speaking of the, the human side of things,

94
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.990
I've had a bunch of the Fox hosts on, and you know,

95
00:05:33.991 --> 00:05:38.760
you guys all just get endlessly trashed in the media and you get the

96
00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:42.780
media matters boycotts, and they go for your sponsors and all of that stuff.

97
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.300
And I don't know how comfortable you comfortable.

98
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.350
You you'll be talking about this,

99
00:05:46.351 --> 00:05:50.550
but you did mention to me once how it can take a toll, you know, when you're,

100
00:05:50.551 --> 00:05:52.020
when you're in your town and Oh,

101
00:05:52.021 --> 00:05:55.440
there's judging and she's on Fox and just dealing with some of,

102
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.580
some of that kind of hate. And yet you always have a smile on your face. I mean,

103
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.600
what, what's that like? Just, just being, you, you live in New York,

104
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.170
you you're a public person and you got to deal with some,

105
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.640
some pretty hateful stuff.

106
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.640
<v 0>Yeah, I do. I do. But you see the difference for me is, um,</v>

107
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.710
I ran for office five times. I am hardened with steel, uh,

108
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.910
and, uh, I'm used to it. I mean, I used to boy copy for this or that,

109
00:06:21.911 --> 00:06:26.290
or I'd prosecuted case. They didn't like it. Or, uh, you know, you know what,

110
00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.850
I really don't care if you care enough that,

111
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.860
uh, you're thinking about changing your mind, then care and change your mind.

112
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.250
But if you're, if you believe that what you're doing is right,

113
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.810
I don't give it a second thought, but what I am amazed, uh,

114
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.520
at, or with is the fact that people on the left dropped me.

115
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.510
You know, when Trump got elected, my friends dropped me and I was like,

116
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.140
but I would never drop you. You know, I, I just wouldn't,

117
00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:01.270
it all started, you know, we all got dropped and I, I found that hurt.

118
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.310
That hurt It hurt. And you know,

119
00:07:06.311 --> 00:07:11.230
when you try, you know, to, to, to not maybe sound as crazy,

120
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.910
and then you just say, you know what, I am who I am. It's a short visit here,

121
00:07:15.911 --> 00:07:20.050
Dave, all of us are here for a short time. And if you,

122
00:07:20.051 --> 00:07:24.040
if you can't be who you are, and if you don't know who you are,

123
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.600
then you better, you know, re-introduce yourself to yourself and get moving.

124
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.970
So I have, I have no regrets and I also don't worry about those people.

125
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.030
Uh, and I also am a gun owner. I have six guns.

126
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.040
<v 1>Uh, as you know, I am an, I am a new gun owner. So, uh, we,</v>

127
00:07:42.041 --> 00:07:45.430
we share some things in common. So you end the book, uh,

128
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:50.080
fittingly with the closing statement. So I feel that we should end this, uh,

129
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.360
interview with a closing statement. I mean,

130
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.860
if someone picks up your book and we're six weeks now, roughly,

131
00:07:56.861 --> 00:07:59.980
but when the book comes out about five weeks before the election,

132
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.630
what is it that you want them to take more than anything else from the book?

133
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.420
<v 0>I want people to recognize that, uh, it is,</v>

134
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.760
it's not just about the lies. I mean,

135
00:08:12.761 --> 00:08:15.610
I identify the lies and I go through the lies,

136
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:19.390
but the most important thing for them to understand is that there's a quote from

137
00:08:19.391 --> 00:08:22.540
Abraham Lincoln, uh, from his speech at Lyceum,

138
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.680
where he talks about the destruction of this country will not come from a

139
00:08:26.681 --> 00:08:29.440
foreign source. It will come from within,

140
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:34.360
and that's what we're facing right now. We're facing an absolute,

141
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:40.030
um, destruction of America. As we know it from forces within America.

142
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:41.500
And we can't let that happen.

143
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.850
<v 1>We're more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics instead of nonstop</v>
