1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.840
<v 0>Look back at your ancestors, look back at your, your grandparents,</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.170
look back at what they did, what they lived through,

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.530
the seeds that they planted,

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.350
that you can afford to be in the circumstance that you are in today.

5
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.950
If you are a black American and you are breathing in the United States today,

6
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.790
you are the luckiest among the luckiest of black people that have ever lived

7
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.690
anywhere on the face of the planet. That is an incredible statement.

8
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.770
All of human history,

9
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.830
the luckiest black people that have ever lived on the face of the human planet

10
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.950
are the ones that are living and breathing in America today. Okay.

11
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.520
If you understand that and you should understand it by simply saying,

12
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.610
where would you like to live in Africa for all of that, that, that,

13
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.820
that hoopla about they took us from Africa,

14
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:42.930
find me a black American that will tell you they want to move back to Africa.

15
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.850
I will listen right now or Europe.

16
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.830
<v 1>I'll book the flights for them.</v>

17
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.010
<v 0>Right? For any person that says we were stolen from our ancestors,</v>

18
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.770
I can assign words in pledging that I will book the flights.

19
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:55.080
If you were now to us, citizenship for you to go live back in now.

20
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.750
<v 2>All right, sir.</v>

21
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.231
<v 1>You're going to books.</v>

22
00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:07.400
I don't have a copy of blackout here because the galleys have not arrived yet,

23
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.200
but the galleys are on the way.

24
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.490
I know that a lot of what we discussed here obviously is what blackout is about.

25
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.230
Um, but what, what maybe did I miss? Or should we, should we hit on?

26
00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:19.070
Or what else?

27
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.520
<v 0>You know, so blackout for me, it was, I really wanted to first and foremost,</v>

28
00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:23.690
lay out my personal story.

29
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:26.300
There's been a lot of conjecture about where I came from,

30
00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:27.620
how I became conservative.

31
00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:31.430
Is she a fraudulent conservative and all of that craziness because people don't

32
00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:34.030
realize that I just was apolitical, if anything else.

33
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.990
<v 1>So to be clear, you're not some sort of secret agent.</v>

34
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.460
You really have been there through all. I've been there since the beginning.

35
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.073
Yeah.

36
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.560
<v 0>Like digesting my entire life saying she must be a plant. Like,</v>

37
00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:47.660
I mean a Soros plant. And I'm like, I've never even voted.

38
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.030
<v 1>Like I literally, prior to getting.</v>

39
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.170
<v 0>Getting into things I had, I genuinely just was not politically inclined. Um,</v>

40
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.290
and I just thought I had to be a Democrat and thought I had to be liberal. And,

41
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.920
you know, looking in the retrospect, I realized how foolish that is. Um,

42
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.740
you know, that I didn't realize that everything was really the,

43
00:02:03.741 --> 00:02:06.980
everything that bad happened in my life was really routed to, uh,

44
00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:09.710
bad policies and bad politicians. Um,

45
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:12.290
but I wanted to first lay out just my personal story. Um, you know,

46
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:16.340
the subtitle of the book is how black America can make it second escape from the

47
00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:20.800
Democrat plantations. Um, and I do believe, um, I say this all the time,

48
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.440
people get upset, um, that black Americans are still enslaved today. Um,

49
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.110
that the left just got smarter and they realized that you, you,

50
00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:30.920
you can enslave people, um, their bodies, you can't have black,

51
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.660
black Americans on the plantation anymore,

52
00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:36.110
but you can still have black Americans doing all the work for you and reaping no

53
00:02:36.111 --> 00:02:36.860
benefit.

54
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.760
And that is a structure that we see today between black America and the Democrat

55
00:02:39.761 --> 00:02:41.870
party. We are doing all of the work we get,

56
00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:46.400
we carried them over the finish line and we benefit not in one single way. Um,

57
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.270
and so I really kind of lay out that argument, um, and,

58
00:02:49.271 --> 00:02:52.730
and talk about what slave life was really like, uh, the breakdown of family,

59
00:02:52.731 --> 00:02:55.310
why it was necessary for families to be broken down, uh,

60
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.170
to trade constantly be treating, um, uh, slaves from one plantation to the nut,

61
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.410
to the next they could, they could have no feelings for one another. Um,

62
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.230
at Frederick Douglas, uh, in his autobiography, the first couple of pages,

63
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.470
he started talking about his life as a slave. Uh,

64
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:11.320
he talks about the fact that when his mother died, he felt nothing. Uh,

65
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:15.400
when his sisters were treated until he felt nothing, he had no sense of kinship,

66
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.200
no, no familial love, uh,

67
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:20.410
for his own blood that was necessary to the institution of slavery.

68
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:24.250
We still have that kinship and that relationship and that community still broken

69
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:26.260
down all of these years later. But later,

70
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:29.230
despite the reconstruction era post-slavery, uh,

71
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:31.810
which we saw black American families getting back together, we weren't,

72
00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:34.240
we were doing something, um, it's all been wiped out.

73
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.560
<v 1>At a higher rate, by the way, until about 72 or so.</v>

74
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.070
<v 0>1850S, black Americans were outpacing whites in terms of economic growth. Um,</v>

75
00:03:43.071 --> 00:03:45.060
and then immediately following, you know, the night,

76
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.160
the 1960s and the great society act, um, and, and the systemic oppression,

77
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.310
which started via the welfare system. Everything started falling apart, um, and,

78
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.660
uh, reading another, another topic, uh, talking, going back to slavery, uh,

79
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.020
black Americans, it was illegal for black Americans learn how to read. In fact,

80
00:04:01.021 --> 00:04:04.230
it was so illegal that if you were a white person, you were taught and you were,

81
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.810
and you were caught teaching your slave to read, uh,

82
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.240
you would be found guilty too. It was a serious sin.

83
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.750
The reason for that is because they didn't want black people being educated

84
00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:15.960
because an educated mind can't be enslaved. Well, what's changed now.

85
00:04:15.961 --> 00:04:18.960
Look at the literacy rates in black America today. Look at Baltimore,

86
00:04:18.961 --> 00:04:22.170
look at the inner cities, look at we're in California at California,

87
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.980
70% of black boys could not pass a basic literacy exam.

88
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.713
Nobody's talking about that.

89
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.350
You have politicians that are standing on stage saying that all they care about

90
00:04:31.351 --> 00:04:32.190
is black Americans.

91
00:04:32.191 --> 00:04:35.790
They're not talking about everything that is harming black Americans today.

92
00:04:35.791 --> 00:04:39.630
Everything that is recreating the very same plantations that we can.

93
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.840
<v 1>Did you catch that brilliant line that Bernie had in one of the debates,</v>

94
00:04:42.841 --> 00:04:46.350
which is he wants, he's not only so pro marijuana, that he wants it to be legal,

95
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.370
but he also wants to have a black community, blacks,

96
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.200
black business owners owning black marijuana shops in black communities.

97
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.830
And again, I say this, I say this as someone that's pro legalizing weed,

98
00:04:58.831 --> 00:04:59.160
but like,

99
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.050
we're going to incentivize black people to own black marijuana shops

100
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.580
in black communities that, that.

101
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.670
<v 0>Right. And, and, and, but that's, and that's why I don't celebrate by the way,</v>

102
00:05:08.671 --> 00:05:11.970
why I'm conservative on the marijuana front is because when you talk about, uh,

103
00:05:11.971 --> 00:05:14.580
where this is happening, Chicago, I think just passed, uh, you know,

104
00:05:14.581 --> 00:05:17.910
marijuana laws. It is, to me, I know it's,

105
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.850
it's going to lead to more dysfunction, um, you know,

106
00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:23.490
amongst black America first and foremost, because that's how it always is.

107
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.690
You know, it's, it's,

108
00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:28.260
what is it about progressive policies that always leads to progressive results

109
00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:32.340
for the black community first and foremost. And, um, so I,

110
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.040
I am low, uh,

111
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.020
to S to be smart enough to see the debate between, uh, alcohol and marijuana,

112
00:05:40.021 --> 00:05:44.070
so that I can't firmly say Ana, but I have a thinking brain,

113
00:05:44.071 --> 00:05:47.550
and I just don't see how conservatives can make a sound argument against it at

114
00:05:47.551 --> 00:05:48.384
the moment.

115
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.520
<v 1>What else has to happen for the black community to break? Uh,</v>

116
00:05:52.521 --> 00:05:54.840
I'm going to guess, although I don't have the book yet that at the end,

117
00:05:54.841 --> 00:05:55.231
you're going to,

118
00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:59.630
you either make some predictions or you tell people what tools they need to

119
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.710
really break out of this.

120
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:01.770
<v 0>Yeah. You know, it's, it's,</v>

121
00:06:01.771 --> 00:06:04.900
it's not even about making predictions and I have my own personal predictions,

122
00:06:04.901 --> 00:06:06.370
but I definitely am not doing that in the book.

123
00:06:06.371 --> 00:06:08.380
I'm giving black Americans a guide. I'm giving,

124
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.770
giving black Americans and option, uh, the same option, uh,

125
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.200
that I saw before me when I started waking up.

126
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:16.930
And I'm having this conversation with you, um, you can,

127
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.480
you can have the option to accept this victim narrative, right?

128
00:06:19.481 --> 00:06:23.350
You can have the option to say, I accept this diagnosis of cancer,

129
00:06:23.351 --> 00:06:26.470
even though I feel fine, walk fine and have been living fine my entire life.

130
00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.070
I accept that it's terminal illness and I'm going to live like I'm going to die

131
00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:32.830
any moment. Um, or, or you can,

132
00:06:32.831 --> 00:06:35.770
you can develop a different perspective and you can develop a victim mentality.

133
00:06:35.771 --> 00:06:39.100
As I say, forget the victim mentality, develop a victim mentality. Um,

134
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.910
look back at your ancestors, look back at your, your grandparents,

135
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.280
look back at what they did, what they lived through, the,

136
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.600
the seeds that they planted,

137
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.420
that you can afford to be in the circumstance that you are in today.

138
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.020
If you are a black American and you are breathing in the United States today,

139
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.860
you are the luckiest among the luckiest of black people that have ever lived

140
00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.760
anywhere on the face of the planet. That is an incredible statement.

141
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:01.840
All of human history,

142
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.900
the luckiest black people that have ever lived on the face of the human planet

143
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.020
are the ones that are living and breathing in America today. Okay.

144
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.590
If you understand that, and you should understand it by simply saying,

145
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.680
where would you like to live in Africa for all of that, that, that,

146
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.890
that hoopla about they took us from Africa,

147
00:07:17.891 --> 00:07:22.000
find me a black American that will tell you they want to move back to Africa.

148
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.530
I will listen right now, or Europe I'll book the flights for them, right?

149
00:07:26.531 --> 00:07:29.080
For any person that says we were stolen from our ancestors.

150
00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:31.840
I can't assign words in pledging that I will book the flights.

151
00:07:31.841 --> 00:07:33.840
If you were now to us, citizenship for you to go live back.

152
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:34.720
<v 1>In Africa,</v>

153
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.150
you want to cap this and maybe a 10 people just in case people were punking.

154
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.350
Yeah. I hate America.

155
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.530
Everyone offered them money and flights. I think you might have done.

156
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.230
<v 0>You took, nobody took the bait, right?</v>

157
00:07:47.231 --> 00:07:51.160
Because they know America is the greatest place they could possibly live. Um,

158
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.053
and I feel.

159
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.630
<v 1>Like if someone takes you up on this I'll guarantee one first-class upgrade.</v>

160
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.290
That's amazing. I will do. There you go. Right here. First class upgrades.
