00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.290
<v 1>Talked about reasons to close schools, even if kids there are.</v>

2
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.580
<v 2>Yeah. I mean, school closures. There's a lot of debate about this.</v>

3
00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:18.230
There are two kinds of school closures,

4
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.630
and most of the countries shutting the schools anyway. Now,

5
00:00:20.631 --> 00:00:22.340
so this point is behind us.

6
00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:25.610
I was sending out this information like three or four weeks ago,

7
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.380
but school closures are two kinds.

8
00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:31.280
There's reactive school closure when there's a case in the school and you close

9
00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:34.490
the school and that's pretty uncontroversial. I mean, most parents, teachers,

10
00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:37.520
public health experts. There's an outbreak epidemic in the school.

11
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.530
Let's close the school. And it's been shown that if you do that, you lower the,

12
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.090
if you close the schools in an, in an area, you lower the cumulative, um,

13
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.010
prevalence of the condition by about 25% and postpone the epidemic by a

14
00:00:52.011 --> 00:00:56.060
week or two, which is good. So reactive school closure is helpful,

15
00:00:56.061 --> 00:00:59.120
but you know, it's not as good as we can do.

16
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.480
Even better is something called proactive school closure.

17
00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:06.050
When you close the schools, even before there's a case in the schools,

18
00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:10.520
for instance, you living in a mid-sized town, there's a case in the community.

19
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.850
It's something called the community acquired case.

20
00:01:13.851 --> 00:01:18.080
So it's not like someone from Italy or China flew to your town,

21
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.180
landed, had symptoms and you diagnose them. That would be an imported case.

22
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.530
Maybe you could isolate that person and self quarantined,

23
00:01:27.531 --> 00:01:30.050
the people who they connected with. No,

24
00:01:30.051 --> 00:01:32.750
we're talking about a situation in which someone in the community is diagnosed.

25
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.620
And we have no idea where they got it. They're like a Canary in the coal mine.

26
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.940
And if that's happening, you can be quite confident that within a week or two,

27
00:01:40.941 --> 00:01:42.260
it's going to be in the school.

28
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.090
So why not close the school now reduce the force of the

29
00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:50.630
epidemic by decreasing social mixing. And ironically,

30
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.090
even though the kids aren't affected by this condition,

31
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:56.630
they still can transmit the pathogen, even though they themselves aren't sick.

32
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.860
And furthermore,

33
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.270
one of the ways that school closure works is precisely because it compels the

34
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:06.650
parents to stay home. So it reduces the parents interacting with each other.

35
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.270
That's how it works in part.

36
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.110
<v 1>Yeah. And it sounds like we've, we've basically done this pretty well,</v>

37
00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:15.770
maybe a little later than you want it to, but it sounds like now we're there.

38
00:02:15.771 --> 00:02:16.604
Right?

39
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.920
<v 2>Definitely, definitely later than we wanted to.</v>

40
00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:22.700
And for schools that are still open, what I would strongly recommend.

41
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.830
And my wife and I had an article in the Atlantic about this a few days ago is if

42
00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:30.950
you insist on staying open and I don't think that's the best course of action,

43
00:02:30.951 --> 00:02:35.420
at least you can implement a whole host of other harm mitigation strategies.

44
00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:39.320
For example, give parents the choice. If they want to keep their kids home,

45
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.760
they should stay home.

46
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.410
I want to mention this because it's also relevant to employers and workers,

47
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.310
allowing any worker who can work at home to work at home.

48
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.000
It's not just good for that worker from like their selfish point of view.

49
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:56.840
It helps everybody because you reduce the number of people at the office.

50
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.790
So only the people that have to be there, be there, same with schools.

51
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.150
If some parents want to keep the school should let them keep their kids home.

52
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.060
You can broaden drop off and pick up hours.

53
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:10.690
So not everyone is arriving between eight and eight 15 to drop off their kids,

54
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.890
bumping against each other. As they come through the door, parents interacting.

55
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.000
You let's say you give a 45 minute drop-off it needs a bit more manpower on the

56
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:22.960
part of the school, but you reduce the social density at pickup and drop off,

57
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.280
cancel staff meetings, uh, uh, provide cafeteria seating,

58
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.850
broadened the lunch hour and have the kids sit. Every other chair.

59
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.700
These are things that schools can do if they insist on staying open,

60
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:35.380
maybe in our Southern States, for instance,

61
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:39.220
where maybe the virus hasn't hit so much yet, but that nevertheless are helpful.

62
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.840
<v 1>We're obviously in some unchartered territory with coronavirus and our plan here</v>

63
00:03:42.841 --> 00:03:46.470
is to help you make as much sense of the situation in a not alarmist fashion as

64
00:03:46.471 --> 00:03:47.041
possible.

65
00:03:47.041 --> 00:03:50.760
