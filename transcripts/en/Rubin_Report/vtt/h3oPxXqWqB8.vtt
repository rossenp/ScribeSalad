WEBVTT

1
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.173
<v 0>Oh.</v>

2
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.870
<v 1>Really cow people. It is</v>

3
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.630
November 19th, 2020, I'm Dave Rubin. This is the Rubin report, direct message.

4
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.550
And I am caffeinated. I chugged the glass of water and I'm ready to roll today.

5
00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:25.190
There is so much going on yet. Uh, today,

6
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.580
yesterday I did three stories that just sort of, uh,

7
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.510
shined a light on just general progressive lunacy across the board.

8
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:35.480
But today there is like just so many things happening at once.

9
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.580
I hope and assume that some of you watched at least part of this Rudy

10
00:00:40.581 --> 00:00:43.160
Giuliani, Sidney Powell, uh,

11
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.930
press conference that they just had where they're beginning to lay out the case

12
00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:51.860
for what they are now calling massive election fraud.

13
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.980
Just because they're saying it doesn't mean it's true,

14
00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:56.990
but they are beginning to lay out the case.

15
00:00:56.991 --> 00:01:00.110
We're going to show you some video and I'll tell you a bit about what they said.

16
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.110
If you didn't see it, but it seemingly starting to come together.

17
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.850
And ultimately either at this point, these guys are lying and,

18
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.650
and at the same time taking down their careers and probably personal

19
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.000
lives in any prospects for a D a decent future on this earth,

20
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.470
or they've really got something here. So for all of the people that,

21
00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:25.550
for the last, you know, roughly 15, 16 days since the election have been saying,

22
00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:28.070
well, you got to have some proof, you've got to have some proof. Of course,

23
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:30.980
that is true and correct. Uh,

24
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.280
well now it seems like they're starting to leak some of that out.

25
00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:36.170
There was some really interesting stuff that they were talking about.

26
00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:38.900
So we'll get to that. We're also gonna talk about,

27
00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:43.220
I'm going to play some video of a California Republican,

28
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.630
who had some interesting things to say about Gavin Newsome, having dinner.

29
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.540
And he had an interesting flip on it. The guy by the name of Tom McClintock,

30
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.210
I had never heard of him. He's a representative in Northern Cali,

31
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:57.230
but he had a nice flip on what Gavin Newsome has been up to locking us down

32
00:01:57.231 --> 00:01:59.560
while he's having thousand dollar plate dinners. Uh,

33
00:01:59.561 --> 00:02:03.260
and then two stories that are really kind of one story in Illinois. Uh,

34
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.040
they are going to be pushing, uh, this concept to quote,

35
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:11.930
embrace and promote progressive views in schools, not good, not good.

36
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.820
Uh, and directly linked to that.

37
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.890
Megan Kelly is taking her two kids out of New York city schools, uh,

38
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.470
because of some of the stuff that they were trying to brainwash them.

39
00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:22.490
So we're going to link those,

40
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.580
those two together before I do anything else though, real quick,

41
00:02:25.581 --> 00:02:27.800
I just saw this tweet and I felt,

42
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.480
I felt that this exchange that I'm going to read to you right now,

43
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.960
we're going to show you is just like, this is peak 2020.

44
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.140
This is everything that 2020 is about. So I don't know who this woman is.

45
00:02:39.141 --> 00:02:42.980
It doesn't matter who he is, who she is. Don't tweet at her, just let it be.

46
00:02:42.981 --> 00:02:45.990
But I have to read this exchange to you. So this is a woman her,

47
00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:50.510
her Twitter is at, in touch for now. And she tweets, uh, she's in, uh,

48
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.590
Southern Australia.

49
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.180
So she tweets at Hey S a police news that Southern Australia police news,

50
00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.270
for the sake of my stupid husband, who's doing a Karen from Brighton moon.

51
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:06.220
Can you please broadcast very specific information about walking

52
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:10.930
the dog, the South Australian police then respond, hi, Andrea,

53
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.920
you cannot leave the house to walk the dog or to exercise.

54
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.280
She then follows up in a further tree where she thanks them for, uh,

55
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.730
telling her that and say, uh, you know, basically says stay safe,

56
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:24.970
but I just thought it was like the perfect exchange of 2020.

57
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.710
We have people literally tweeting at police stations as to whether their

58
00:03:29.711 --> 00:03:31.630
stupid husband, her words,

59
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:35.410
not mine are allowed to walk the freaking dog.

60
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.180
This is where we're at. This is where we're at. It's just bananas,

61
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.930
but instead of bananas, you know, what's good people. What's good bananas.

62
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.260
Second thoughts of the game. It's this year as new favorite party game,

63
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.430
that's sure to be the hit of your next game night after the election results are

64
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:52.780
made official. If that ever happens,

65
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.200
it will be more necessary than ever to connect with family and friends over some

66
00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:59.740
lighthearted, fun. David and I host Thanksgiving all the time,

67
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:01.750
and we're going to do it this year, despite what's going on.

68
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:05.650
And we're looking forward to playing second thoughts after a delicious Turkey

69
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:06.280
dinner,

70
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.520
the play of the game calls for each team to quickly create a list of words for

71
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:11.890
their opponents to decipher, leading to hilarious,

72
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.060
but puzzlement people love when I say puzzlement and laughter simply put it's a

73
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:17.050
classic word,

74
00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:21.220
guessing game with a unique twist that allows players to personalize the content

75
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:25.450
with their voluminous sense of word smithery or just their witty and warped

76
00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:26.284
imaginations.

77
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.860
Each round of second thoughts is a hilarious high-speed attempt to stump.

78
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:30.694
The other team.

79
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.940
Both teams create a list of five things using the letters revealed from the

80
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:35.830
color of dice, be witty and wise,

81
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:38.710
but don't take too long because time is not on your side.

82
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.390
The amount of time it takes you to create the list is exactly how much time your

83
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:44.560
opponents get to guess them.

84
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.070
This game gets really fun to after a couple of glasses of wine or whiskey or

85
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:50.560
whatever your beverage of choice is. Second thoughts,

86
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.870
the quick thinking versus fast talking party game.

87
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.050
And for the month of November, the game will be on sale at a special price.

88
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.850
So be sure to get yours today at second thoughts,

89
00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.200
the game.com that's second thoughts, the game.com or at your local target store.

90
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.010
And now back to me, okay. People. So for the last hour,

91
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.290
it's been streaming all over the place,

92
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:10.930
but you're not going to see much of it on mainstream news. Again,

93
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.160
the reality war I'm always talking about Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell,

94
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.730
they're Trump's lawyers. They have been making the case. Now you can say,

95
00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:20.950
it's all nonsense. You can say, where's the proof,

96
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.050
but they are now starting to slowly leak things out and they're making

97
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:27.220
massive allegations.

98
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.870
They are talking about massive illegal allegations.

99
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.630
Uh, let's go to this video of Sidney Powell.

100
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:39.070
This is just in the last 15 minutes or, or so, uh, and well,

101
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.080
I don't want to put any words in her mouth, so let's take it.

102
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.560
<v 2>We're allowed to rig their elections. This is stunning,</v>

103
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.630
heartbreaking infuriating,

104
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.430
and the most unpatriotic acts.

105
00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.950
I even imagine for people in this country to have

106
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:03.560
participated in, in any way, shape or form.

107
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.120
And I want the American public to know right now that we will not be

108
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:08.954
intimidated.

109
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.000
American Patriots are fed up with the corruption from the local level to

110
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:17.060
the highest level of our government.

111
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.650
And we are going to take this country back. We are not going to be intimidated.

112
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:26.210
We are not going to back down. We are going to clean this mess up.

113
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.710
Now, president Trump won by a landslide. We are going to prove it.

114
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.360
And we are going to reclaim the United States of America for the people who vote

115
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:36.440
for freedom.

116
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.380
<v 1>So if this is, this is pretty big stuff, okay?</v>

117
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.560
Now she later goes on and there is other video of this.

118
00:06:44.561 --> 00:06:47.560
We were scrambling because it just happened right before we started, uh,

119
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.670
there's other video,

120
00:06:48.671 --> 00:06:52.090
where she talks about how the dominion software actually has a function,

121
00:06:52.091 --> 00:06:53.890
a drag and drop function. This is,

122
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.670
these are her words where you can actually drag votes from one candidate,

123
00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.090
give it to another candidate or an outright, throw it away,

124
00:07:01.091 --> 00:07:04.480
like throw it in your desktop trashcan. Okay? Now,

125
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.900
if they have proof of this and she's saying that they do then,

126
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.380
and she's also saying that thousands and thousands of votes were changed by

127
00:07:11.381 --> 00:07:15.790
this. Well, then we really got something. Okay. Now I am not sitting here.

128
00:07:15.791 --> 00:07:18.580
Dave Rubin on November 19th,

129
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.510
2020 is not set sitting here saying this is true just because they say it,

130
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.720
but let's try it this way. If you're Sidney Powell,

131
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.840
you're a respected lawyer for, for many decades. Rudy Giuliani,

132
00:07:28.841 --> 00:07:33.340
former mayor of New York city got us through nine 11, former attorney general,

133
00:07:33.341 --> 00:07:38.050
former lawyer in, uh, in a presidential administration. Reagan, um,

134
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.330
took down the mafia in New York city.

135
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:42.490
These are people who know how to build a case.

136
00:07:42.491 --> 00:07:44.560
These are people who know how to fight the system.

137
00:07:44.561 --> 00:07:48.250
Sidney Powell was Michael Flynn's lawyer. Now that doesn't mean they're,

138
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:50.590
they're true. They're what they're saying is true.

139
00:07:50.591 --> 00:07:52.330
It doesn't mean they have some airtight case.

140
00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:54.580
I'm literally not sitting here saying that.

141
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.130
What I am saying is just at a personal level,

142
00:07:57.131 --> 00:08:00.250
like if they're just saying crazy stuff,

143
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.800
if they're just making it up and saying crazy stuff,

144
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.020
even though they have sworn affidavits,

145
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.850
they're saying that they have people on the inside and they're putting together

146
00:08:06.851 --> 00:08:10.300
the case. Everyone wants them to just drop all the info now, but that's not,

147
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.210
you know, if any of you have ever been in any sort of legal proceedings,

148
00:08:13.211 --> 00:08:17.170
whether you're in a divorce or a civil case or a criminal case,

149
00:08:17.171 --> 00:08:19.510
you don't just drop everything that every, the second you get info,

150
00:08:19.511 --> 00:08:21.460
you don't just drop it and share it with everybody. Right?

151
00:08:21.461 --> 00:08:25.180
You build a case so you can drop the bomb or release the crackin. As they say,

152
00:08:25.181 --> 00:08:28.300
now, I'm not even saying there is a crack in, but what they are saying now is,

153
00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.880
Hey, we know thousands of boats were switched.

154
00:08:30.881 --> 00:08:33.640
We know how it happened within the electronic voting systems.

155
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.410
She's also calling it a,

156
00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.370
I think she said an international conspiracy because votes were counted in

157
00:08:39.371 --> 00:08:41.290
Venezuela. Like, like a whole bunch of stuff.

158
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.020
But the point is at the personal level,

159
00:08:44.021 --> 00:08:47.920
putting aside the political level for a moment, if they're just making it up,

160
00:08:47.921 --> 00:08:52.120
like then, then Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani are legitimately insane, right?

161
00:08:52.121 --> 00:08:54.760
Like if they're going to destroy their professional lives, their,

162
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.360
but not just that their personal lives. Yeah.

163
00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:59.090
Their ability to get jobs in the future,

164
00:08:59.091 --> 00:09:02.510
their ability to be part of respectful society. It's like,

165
00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.970
if they're willing to do that out of what misguided loyalty to Trump or,

166
00:09:06.971 --> 00:09:09.110
or something like that, like then they're,

167
00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.980
they're actually nuts and should probably be examined by psychological

168
00:09:12.981 --> 00:09:15.140
professionals. I suspect.

169
00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.710
It's not that it doesn't mean that everything they're saying is exactly right.

170
00:09:18.711 --> 00:09:21.740
And this is what they're going to have to prove. But, but we're in a really,

171
00:09:21.741 --> 00:09:24.380
really interesting spot right now. And again,

172
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.940
watch idea. I don't like having to ask people to do this,

173
00:09:28.941 --> 00:09:33.800
but watch a little bit of mainstream media tonight. Watch, watch CBS, ABC, uh,

174
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.390
ABC, CBS, ABC, and NBC. Wow. Watch them tonight. Watch CNN tonight.

175
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.050
I never tell anyone to do that. I'm sorry. But if you watch them tonight,

176
00:09:42.051 --> 00:09:44.540
like see how they report on this.

177
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:49.310
See if they show you the quotes about the dragon drop about talking about

178
00:09:49.311 --> 00:09:54.050
massive fraud. Like whether the people at ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN,

179
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:55.310
et cetera, whether they think it's true or not,

180
00:09:55.311 --> 00:09:58.430
like they're supposed to report on them. The news, this is a news event. Now,

181
00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.220
if it's a news event of people that are fraudulent liars, well,

182
00:10:01.221 --> 00:10:04.310
then you report on that. But when they ignore something,

183
00:10:04.311 --> 00:10:06.230
well then people start going, well, wait a minute.

184
00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:09.500
Maybe something is here that leaves people like me going. All right.

185
00:10:09.501 --> 00:10:12.710
I guess I got to, I guess I got to talk about these things. Uh, Hey guys,

186
00:10:12.711 --> 00:10:16.250
before we get to the other stories though, I want to talk about Glint card.

187
00:10:16.251 --> 00:10:16.401
You know,

188
00:10:16.401 --> 00:10:19.700
I've been talking about Glenn card for the last week or so it really is a super

189
00:10:19.701 --> 00:10:24.440
cool way of buying and selling gold. And then actually being able to use it,

190
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.200
not just saying I've got some gold, I can't do anything with it. Oh, it went up,

191
00:10:27.201 --> 00:10:28.034
it went down.

192
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:32.720
Whatever else you can actually use it by using your own Glint

193
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.880
pay card, the Glint card,

194
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.980
which allows you to buy products on Amazon or at Starbucks or

195
00:10:39.981 --> 00:10:42.830
wherever you go, you can use it just like a debit card.

196
00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:44.210
And you can choose within the app,

197
00:10:44.211 --> 00:10:48.680
whether you want to actually spend gold or you want to spend your own cash and

198
00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:51.920
then you can buy and sell within the app as well. And it's all super easy.

199
00:10:51.921 --> 00:10:54.140
They take really low fees and all that good stuff.

200
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:58.100
And it's just an interesting way of getting a little more control over your

201
00:10:58.101 --> 00:11:00.020
finances. So you guys should totally check it out.

202
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.770
And the Glint card is issued by Sutton bank, which is a member of FDI.

203
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:08.090
See pursuant to license from MasterCard international. It's free to sign up.

204
00:11:08.091 --> 00:11:08.924
So go to Glint,

205
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:14.240
pay.com/rubin for more info and to start purchasing gold today, that's Glint

206
00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:19.100
pay.com/ruben to get your gold today. And now back to me. So,

207
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:23.600
so we'll go from Glint to McClintock. Did that work?

208
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.240
I felt like that was sort of a transition there. That was something like that.

209
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.850
So you guys all know the story of the last couple of days.

210
00:11:28.851 --> 00:11:31.850
Gavin Newsome our ridiculous governor here in California,

211
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.580
who was the mayor of San Francisco who ruined San Francisco,

212
00:11:34.581 --> 00:11:38.960
but then became governor. And he wants rules for the, but not for me.

213
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.140
He's up at French laundry, which is in wine country.

214
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.930
He's at a dinner with 12 people. It's indoors,

215
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.840
big chandelier's carpets thousand bucks a plate.

216
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.420
I don't begrudge him any of that. Uh,

217
00:11:50.421 --> 00:11:53.710
other than he's telling us not to do that and telling us that we can't have

218
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:57.970
people over for Thanksgiving. Well, a representative Tom McClintock,

219
00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:01.300
who is a rare Republican here in California, uh,

220
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:05.680
he was on the floor and he had this to say about Gavin. And I thought it was,

221
00:12:05.681 --> 00:12:08.410
I thought it was a nice twist on things. So take a look.

222
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:14.880
<v 3>Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning and defense of governor Gavin Newsome,</v>

223
00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.570
who recently defied his own idiotic COVID edicts.

224
00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.650
As he partied at one of the few restaurants is not yet been forced out of

225
00:12:22.651 --> 00:12:23.484
business.

226
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.560
I defend him because he was doing what we once all did in a free

227
00:12:28.561 --> 00:12:29.394
society,

228
00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:34.500
make our own decisions over what risks we're willing to run and what precautions

229
00:12:34.501 --> 00:12:35.460
we're willing to take.

230
00:12:35.461 --> 00:12:40.410
According to our own circumstances to protect our own health. Yes,

231
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.120
COVID is a nasty bug in a quarter of a million Americans have died while having

232
00:12:45.121 --> 00:12:48.420
it, but this isn't double Bohnet plague.

233
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.500
The CDCs best estimate is that if you're under 49,

234
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.980
your chance for surviving COVID if you get it is

235
00:12:55.981 --> 00:12:59.910
99.92%.

236
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:05.130
Even if you're over 70, you have a 94.6% rate of recovery,

237
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.000
40% who get it, don't even know they have it.

238
00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.620
And yet we've allowed our officials to ruin our quality of life over it,

239
00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:18.690
destroying countless businesses, throwing tens of millions into unemployment,

240
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:23.790
robbing our children of their educations and shredding our most cherished rights

241
00:13:23.791 --> 00:13:24.720
as Americans.

242
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.530
<v 1>McClintock. I don't live in your district, but I like, yeah.</v>

243
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.660
And I liked the way you took the flip on that thing,

244
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:35.100
because he's saying in essence, yes, people,

245
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:39.840
we have to make some choices in our lives and we can't stay locked down

246
00:13:39.841 --> 00:13:43.200
forever. While our leaders decide to not, uh,

247
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:47.970
obey the very laws that they're pushing on us, the laws, the edicts,

248
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.440
the all of the,

249
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:53.370
all of the nonsense that every day they tell us some new thing can't happen and

250
00:13:53.371 --> 00:13:57.900
it's, or new, some new thing must be obeyed. And it's like, man,

251
00:13:57.901 --> 00:14:01.800
how can you run a business? How can you live a functional life like this?

252
00:14:01.801 --> 00:14:03.720
So I like this Tom McClintock and you know,

253
00:14:03.721 --> 00:14:06.750
one of the things that everyone in California, it's so interesting.

254
00:14:06.751 --> 00:14:09.510
One of the things that I find about California, more than anything else,

255
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:13.470
if you ask anyone in California, especially San Francisco and LA, you ask them,

256
00:14:13.471 --> 00:14:17.850
well, how's it going here? Everybody is like, man, education sucks.

257
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.990
The road sucks. There's homelessness everywhere. The drug use taxes are high.

258
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.230
That it's hard for businesses and we're locked down, but like, and then,

259
00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:26.940
and then you go, well, why do you live here? And they go, well, the weather,

260
00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.010
the weather is nice. And the weather is nice by the way.

261
00:14:29.011 --> 00:14:30.870
It's basically last week here,

262
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:35.280
it's been 78 to 82 and just beautiful, nice and crisp. In the morning,

263
00:14:35.281 --> 00:14:38.400
I took a long walk with the dog this morning and I was with my buddy.

264
00:14:38.401 --> 00:14:38.761
And I was like,

265
00:14:38.761 --> 00:14:42.900
this is why you pay the high taxes and you deal with all the nonsense,

266
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.540
but that at some point become secondary to all of the crazy stuff.

267
00:14:48.541 --> 00:14:53.090
Right. And we are a party state pretty much.

268
00:14:53.091 --> 00:14:55.340
So Tom McClintock, you're doing something right.

269
00:14:55.341 --> 00:14:57.800
You want to run for governor dude. Cause that, that would be,

270
00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:59.150
that would be pretty great.

271
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.060
We do need some people I know more and more people keep thinking I'm running for

272
00:15:02.061 --> 00:15:05.420
governor, but I like this. I like this. You know, like the idea,

273
00:15:05.421 --> 00:15:09.960
I gotta go to the state Capitol and deal with the lobbyists and the morons. I,

274
00:15:09.961 --> 00:15:13.760
I just can't do it. Uh, but speaking of, uh, education, uh,

275
00:15:13.761 --> 00:15:16.910
these last two stories that I'm going to sort of combine into one story,

276
00:15:16.911 --> 00:15:19.310
I think they're sort of perfect and they come out of,

277
00:15:19.311 --> 00:15:22.760
you're not going to believe it guys, totally Democrat run States,

278
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.360
Illinois and New York and specifically, uh,

279
00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.970
Chicago and New York city. Uh,

280
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.870
so Illinois schools are now proposing a rule that would force teachers to

281
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.790
promise that they would him quote,

282
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:41.290
race and promote progressive views. So let's, uh, get some quotes on this.

283
00:15:41.291 --> 00:15:42.880
This is from the daily wire,

284
00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:47.020
the rule published in the Illinois register on September 11th,

285
00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:52.000
title culturally responsive teaching and leading standards for all Illinois

286
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:56.470
educators requires that educators embrace and encourage progressive

287
00:15:56.471 --> 00:16:01.240
viewpoints and perspectives that leverage asset thinking towards traditionally

288
00:16:01.241 --> 00:16:03.280
marginalized populations.

289
00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.970
It further States to address systems of oppression.

290
00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:12.250
A culturally responsive teacher and leader will be aware of the effects of power

291
00:16:12.251 --> 00:16:17.200
and privilege and the need for social advocacy and social action to

292
00:16:17.201 --> 00:16:21.520
better empower diverse students and committee. Okay,

293
00:16:21.521 --> 00:16:26.110
I could go on and on. And again, you can read the full piece at the daily wire.

294
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.810
Um, but I think you get where I'm going with this.

295
00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:33.700
They are trying as if they haven't done it enough as if the cultural

296
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:38.440
and intellectual rot of the left of social justice,

297
00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:43.180
of critical race theory of oppress oppressor and the oppressed as if

298
00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:48.010
all of this hasn't wrought enough damage on our systems and our way of thinking

299
00:16:48.011 --> 00:16:52.090
and led us to this insane polarized place that we're in right now.

300
00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:57.070
Well now they want it in public schools, not just at places of higher education,

301
00:16:57.071 --> 00:16:59.560
which mostly is about getting stoned because I don't think anyone's getting any

302
00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:02.110
real higher education at colleges anymore. Um,

303
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:04.570
seriously dangerous stuff,

304
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:09.610
the effects of power and privilege and the need for social advocacy and

305
00:17:09.611 --> 00:17:13.680
social action to better empower diverse students and communities. Meaning in,

306
00:17:13.681 --> 00:17:17.020
in short, it is judge us on our skin color,

307
00:17:17.021 --> 00:17:19.330
judge us on our ethnicity,

308
00:17:19.331 --> 00:17:22.450
judge us on our gender and our sexuality,

309
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:27.460
all of the stuff that is the reverse of what the United States was set up

310
00:17:27.461 --> 00:17:29.620
to do. And now they are going to,

311
00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.530
they're going to infect this into the system.

312
00:17:32.531 --> 00:17:37.420
So they will actually create a system of systemic racism

313
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:41.740
and systemic privilege. And the rest of it, I should mention that, you know,

314
00:17:41.741 --> 00:17:43.180
one of the things when people say to me, Dave,

315
00:17:43.181 --> 00:17:46.240
how do you say you're liberal anymore? And I, I barely do say that it's not,

316
00:17:46.241 --> 00:17:49.090
it's not that I am not classically liberal.

317
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:51.810
I have discussed for years and years and years, but in effect,

318
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.980
if you're a classical liberal, you're an old-school JFK liberal and you,

319
00:17:54.981 --> 00:17:56.940
and you believe any of the things that I laid out in my book,

320
00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.910
or I talk about here, like in effect, you're, you're a conservative of today.

321
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:01.890
Like it just, it just is reality.

322
00:18:01.891 --> 00:18:04.920
I don't mind if someone calls me a conservative, I'm trying to conserve America,

323
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.330
I'm trying to conserve liberalism.

324
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.900
But one of the things that I say often is people say, well,

325
00:18:09.901 --> 00:18:11.550
what makes you a liberal? And I could, you know, okay,

326
00:18:11.551 --> 00:18:16.170
I'm for gay marriage and I'm against the death penalty and I'm begrudgingly pro

327
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:16.710
choice.

328
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:19.950
And one of the other ones that I always say is I feel that there is some level

329
00:18:19.951 --> 00:18:22.890
of state education, public education that is valuable.

330
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.730
I'm not sure how much longer I can say that one because as the state gets taken

331
00:18:26.731 --> 00:18:29.280
over by these terrible ideas, which by the way,

332
00:18:29.281 --> 00:18:32.010
Trump was really fighting by getting CRT,

333
00:18:32.011 --> 00:18:35.610
critical race theory out of the institutions. If he's gone and,

334
00:18:35.611 --> 00:18:39.000
and these ideas get back in there, it's like, how can I possibly defend that?

335
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.340
The state should have to educate anyone because in essence,

336
00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.790
they're not educating anyone. They're just indoctrinating people. Uh,

337
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.450
but speaking of that, very thing, uh, Megan Kelly, who, as you guys know, she's,

338
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:51.780
she's a friend of mine and has been on the show a few times and I'm actually

339
00:18:51.781 --> 00:18:54.900
taping her podcast tomorrow. So I think that'll air, uh,

340
00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.760
probably in a day or two after that. Uh,

341
00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:01.410
she is actually now taking her kids out of New York schools.

342
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:05.070
And, uh, let's go to the quotes from her. It's really quite something. Uh,

343
00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.210
this is from her,

344
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:10.740
from her podcast where she announced this it's out of control on so many levels.

345
00:19:10.741 --> 00:19:14.160
And after years of resisting it, we're going to leave the city.

346
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:18.810
We pulled our boys from their school and our daughter is going to be leaving

347
00:19:18.811 --> 00:19:22.260
hers soon, too. The schools have always been far left,

348
00:19:22.261 --> 00:19:25.890
which doesn't align with my own ideology, but I didn't really care.

349
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:29.940
Most of my friends are liberals. It's fine. I come from Democrats as a family.

350
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.790
I'm not offended at all by the ideology.

351
00:19:32.791 --> 00:19:37.230
And I leaned center left on some things, but they've gone around the bend.

352
00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:41.370
I mean, they have gone off the deep end this summer in the wake of George Floyd.

353
00:19:41.371 --> 00:19:43.830
They circulated amongst the diversity group,

354
00:19:43.831 --> 00:19:45.930
which includes white parents like us.

355
00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:51.090
There are people who want to be allies and stay attuned to what we do an article

356
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.530
and afterward they research-related it and wanted every member of the

357
00:19:55.531 --> 00:19:59.790
faculty to read it. So what you need to understand here, and if you want,

358
00:19:59.791 --> 00:20:01.590
if you want the full context of all of that,

359
00:20:01.591 --> 00:20:04.380
you should listen to Megan Kelly's podcast. But in essence,

360
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:07.890
Megan is saying she's pretty much on the right, right. She's a,

361
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.190
she's a conservative, but much like some of the things that I just laid out,

362
00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.520
gay marriage, I think she's against the death penalty.

363
00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.930
I'm not totally sure on that one.

364
00:20:15.931 --> 00:20:18.000
I think she's a little more open when it comes to abortion.

365
00:20:18.001 --> 00:20:20.220
I don't want to speak totally for her, but you,

366
00:20:20.221 --> 00:20:23.880
you get it that this is not Megan Kelly, whether you like or not.

367
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.610
And by the way, some of my audience that that's more on the trumps, I'd really,

368
00:20:26.611 --> 00:20:30.570
doesn't like her. And that's just fine, by the way, um,

369
00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.030
that this is not an extremist by any estimation.

370
00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:36.750
This is someone who comes from a family of Democrats who says right here that

371
00:20:36.751 --> 00:20:38.340
she has some center left,

372
00:20:38.341 --> 00:20:42.600
use this as someone who obviously should be able to educate her kids and send

373
00:20:42.601 --> 00:20:46.110
her kids to a school that is open and pluralistic and all of those things.

374
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:50.320
But in essence, she's saying is they have gone too far.

375
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:53.530
They have just gone too far. They are injecting racism and everything.

376
00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:57.290
They're teaching white kids to feel inherently guilty by the car,

377
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:58.540
the color of their skin,

378
00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:02.560
that's called racism and she's getting her kids out.

379
00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:06.940
So I combine that with the story from Illinois that I just went over

380
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:10.270
because I think good people are going to start selecting out.

381
00:21:10.271 --> 00:21:11.530
I think over the next year,

382
00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:14.680
we're going to see more of more and more of this good people are just going to

383
00:21:14.681 --> 00:21:17.170
start selecting out of the system and out of the system. I mean,

384
00:21:17.171 --> 00:21:18.760
they're going to take their kids out of public school.

385
00:21:18.761 --> 00:21:22.150
They're going to do more homeschooling or, or charter schools or school choice,

386
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:22.930
by the way,

387
00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:26.860
charter schools and school choice things that Democrats are against as they send

388
00:21:26.861 --> 00:21:29.710
their kids, usually to charter schools and private schools,

389
00:21:29.711 --> 00:21:31.060
much like Gavin Newsome does,

390
00:21:31.061 --> 00:21:34.810
of course the governor here and just like Elizabeth Warren does in

391
00:21:34.811 --> 00:21:37.270
Massachusetts, um, Elizabeth Warren,

392
00:21:37.271 --> 00:21:41.410
who also pretended to be native Americans so that she could, uh, you know,

393
00:21:41.411 --> 00:21:43.720
get a job. So, you know, that, that sort of what these,

394
00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:45.250
what these people are up up,

395
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:48.010
but I think more and more people are going to select out they'll select that a

396
00:21:48.011 --> 00:21:50.560
public schools. I think they're going to select out of social media.

397
00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:53.620
I think they're going to select out of jobs that traditional companies,

398
00:21:53.621 --> 00:21:57.040
as more and more companies become infected with these ideas. And by the way,

399
00:21:57.041 --> 00:21:59.110
I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.

400
00:21:59.111 --> 00:22:03.970
I think the thing that I am probably most proud of in my life is that by going

401
00:22:03.971 --> 00:22:06.790
independent, by going solo, building studios,

402
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.740
building technology like we did with locals to make sure I'd be okay without big

403
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:15.340
tech. And it's not a perfect system, but we're, we're getting pretty close, uh,

404
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.500
to employ people, to treat my guys well.

405
00:22:17.501 --> 00:22:20.800
So they work hard for me so we can grow the business so I can treat them better

406
00:22:20.801 --> 00:22:23.170
and we can keep doing that wonderful exchange.

407
00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:27.070
The capitalism is all about while in some ways I've, I've selected out.

408
00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.880
Now I do this on YouTube. Obviously we got to get stuff on Apple podcasts,

409
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:34.780
Spotify, and everywhere else. So there's no perfect system,

410
00:22:34.781 --> 00:22:38.170
but I think we have opportunities now to rethink the world and think about what

411
00:22:38.171 --> 00:22:39.400
you really want to do.

412
00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.460
Do you want to send your kids to places where there'll be brainwashed?

413
00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:45.730
Do you want to work at big companies that are ant that hold views that are

414
00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:50.080
antithetical to your own? You got an opportunity to figure it out.

415
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:53.800
So that is today's silver lining. Uh, by the way, guys,

416
00:22:53.801 --> 00:22:57.790
part two of my interview with North Korean defector Youngmi park,

417
00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:01.960
who's also a friend of mine and just an absolutely inspirational person who is

418
00:23:01.961 --> 00:23:05.770
now worried about America after living in North Korea and China.

419
00:23:05.771 --> 00:23:09.580
And she tells us why, uh, part two of our interview just went up this morning.

420
00:23:09.581 --> 00:23:14.530
Part one's already there. Uh, the full episode is already up@rubinreport.com.
