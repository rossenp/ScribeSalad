1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.110
<v 0>What we've done is we've,</v>

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.030
we've taken $7,500 from every American or

3
00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:10.830
16, 16,500 from every taxpayer

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.830
$16,000 from every taxpayer.

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.620
And then given some of those taxpayers,

6
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.090
a check for $1,200 that that's, that's not helping.

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.170
We taken two and a half trillion dollars and only given

8
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:29.550
355 billion to small businesses. Where's the rest going?

9
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.410
Same place. It went last time.

10
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:41.331
<v 2>Dave Rubin.</v>

11
00:00:41.331 --> 00:00:45.440
And this is the Rubin report joining me today is the founder of the blaze,

12
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.460
the host of the Glenn Beck radio program and the author of the new book,

13
00:00:49.461 --> 00:00:53.300
arguing with socialists Glenn back. Welcome back to the Rubin report.

14
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.490
<v 0>Thanks, man. How are you?</v>

15
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.980
<v 2>I'm all right. Uh, you know,</v>

16
00:00:57.981 --> 00:01:01.460
we are in the midst of a zombie apocalypse and I'm in the people's Republic of

17
00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:06.170
California. So I probably have a shorter list than you do, uh, but I'm okay.

18
00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:06.650
Yeah.

19
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.770
<v 0>Yeah, yeah. I'm good. I'm glad I,</v>

20
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.350
New York glad I'm not in LA, you know,

21
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.730
move to the center of the country for a reason. And, uh, this would be it,

22
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.110
this would be it.

23
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.360
<v 2>So I guess the first obvious question here, uh, beyond just the general,</v>

24
00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:28.160
how you doing during Corona is a as a guy who's sort of been in

25
00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:31.130
mainstream media and out of mainstream media and a,

26
00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:32.900
and a trailblazer in new media.

27
00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:37.130
Did you ever think you'd be doing your show from home? Like Dave Rubin,

28
00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:38.660
does his show from home all the time?

29
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.740
<v 0>I tell you something, Dave, it is cause I've,</v>

30
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.000
I've been in broadcast for like 42 years now. Um,

31
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.630
the technology and what we can accomplish now,

32
00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:54.140
we couldn't have accomplished even 10 years ago. It's phenomenal.

33
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.650
It's really phenomenal. Uh, how,

34
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.600
how the power of the media really is in the hands

35
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.160
of the average person, if they care to take it, it's really crazy.

36
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.040
<v 2>So how treating you in the middle of the country where you are at</v>

37
00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:14.480
least a little bit kind of safe?

38
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.750
<v 0>Yeah. Um, it's, it's pretty good. It's pretty good. Uh, it's not New York.</v>

39
00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:23.270
Thank God. Um, uh,

40
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.010
Texas is still free. Thank God. We've got a good, uh,

41
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.070
governor who is not trying to, uh,

42
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.540
tell everybody exactly what to do. Um, uh, you know,

43
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.140
being home with the kids cause I, my kids live next door,

44
00:02:39.141 --> 00:02:43.460
so we're kind of quarantined together. So we've got nine of us, uh,

45
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.080
you know, uh, living at home, which is, this is nice. It's nice.

46
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.040
It's times where you're like, Oh yeah, I gotta get up. I gotta get out of here.

47
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.310
Um, but most, most of it is good. Most of it is good.

48
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.640
<v 2>So I know we could get into the numbers about Corona and all of stuff. Well,</v>

49
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.790
let's just put that aside,

50
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:03.700
but let's talk about the thing that I think mostly animates,

51
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:07.480
almost everything that you and I do, which is, which is freedom and Liberty.

52
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.950
So as we're hearing about lockdowns being extended and just in the last couple

53
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:14.410
of days, we heard now in LA where I am now,

54
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:17.680
we're at May 15th and we know it'll go beyond that because it's not like you

55
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:20.770
just magically flip the switch and suddenly we're all out there again.

56
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.530
And we see this cascading across the country.

57
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.750
How concerned are you that as we just get more and more stuck in our homes,

58
00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:32.080
as we don't go out, as we don't socialize, as we,

59
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.640
as you probably saw in Michigan,

60
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:37.090
you can't buy seeds at stores to plant your own food.

61
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.890
All of these types of things.

62
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.660
I'm much more concerned about that than I am the virus specifically.

63
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.000
Are you sort of in line with that and what do you make?

64
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.410
<v 0>Yeah, so I said, um,</v>

65
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.750
back in January,

66
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.590
when we were starting to look at this and I said,

67
00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:58.980
this thing is going to sweep. This looks like 1918. I said,

68
00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:02.130
but it's not what concerns me is not the death rate.

69
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.110
What concerns me is what it will do to the economy and what it can do to

70
00:04:07.111 --> 00:04:11.760
freedom. And I think that's, I think that's turning out to be accurate.

71
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.800
Um, the, uh, what, what the federal reserve has done,

72
00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:19.140
what the government has done, uh,

73
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.920
is unprecedented and it's, you know,

74
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.620
to really fully understand it. Cause the, the,

75
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.730
the system of the free market is so complex.

76
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.870
And while it has taken a beating for the last 20 years,

77
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.540
it is very fragile. Uh,

78
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.920
and it's as if we were all on a seven 47, uh,

79
00:04:40.921 --> 00:04:45.390
brand new, uh, Boeing seven 47. And, and, uh,

80
00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:48.870
the pilot said, you know what? It's going to get really, really bumpy up here.

81
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.280
So what we're going to do,

82
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.080
some of you had maybe one could get a concussion or

83
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.860
die. Um, but there are 400 of us on this plane.

84
00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:03.270
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna turn the engines off and right before we

85
00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:08.010
hit the ground, we're going to turn them back on. I wouldn't be for that.

86
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.990
Uh, I would say maybe,

87
00:05:09.991 --> 00:05:13.350
maybe a couple people could bump their head and maybe we could even lose a

88
00:05:13.351 --> 00:05:15.870
couple of people on the plane. I hate to say that,

89
00:05:15.871 --> 00:05:20.640
but nobody's ever turned the engines off in hopes that you

90
00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:25.200
turn them on at exactly the right time before it's just a pile of rubble on the

91
00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:28.620
ground. Um, and that's what they've done.

92
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.160
And I don't know how effective it's going to be. You know,

93
00:05:32.161 --> 00:05:36.930
they're talking about a V economy where they just turn it off and then pump

94
00:05:36.931 --> 00:05:40.260
money into it to preserve it. And then when you turn it back on,

95
00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:44.250
it goes straight back up. It won't, it won't go straight back up.

96
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.030
It can't go straight back up. First of all, you're losing, you know,

97
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.400
80% of jobs that are created are created by the small businessman.

98
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.880
How many of them had enough money just to pay the,

99
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.670
and their rental on their machinery or their, their restaurant.

100
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.850
They're not going to be able to open up. They're open there,

101
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.370
they're running on about a 5% margin.

102
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.710
How many of those restaurants are going to be able to a hold two months

103
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.570
or month and a half then open back up when I don't know about you day,

104
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:21.560
but I'm not going to be going, running out to crowded restaurants right away.

105
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.500
That's the last thing that people are going to do.

106
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.670
This is going to affect us enormously,

107
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.260
enormously. And there's something else. I, I just go ahead. Go ahead.

108
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.200
<v 2>No, so with that in mind,</v>

109
00:06:35.201 --> 00:06:38.950
so before we get to some of the stuff that was done wrong, what,

110
00:06:38.951 --> 00:06:41.230
what would be the right thing to do right now?

111
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.810
So if we're concerned about all those small businesses, I mean,

112
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.600
I know you're not necessarily a UBI guy.

113
00:06:46.601 --> 00:06:48.970
You don't want the government to just be handed cash to people,

114
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.420
but what is the right thing to do then in a situation like this?

115
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.880
<v 0>So I'm not a UBI guy,</v>

116
00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:59.620
and I've done a lot of looking into UBI because I know what's coming with

117
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.600
technology and everything else. And I am,

118
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.740
I'm much more of a futurist than a [inaudible] if you will. Um,

119
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.330
and so I have looked into UBI. It doesn't work. Um,

120
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.570
however, this is a different situation.

121
00:07:13.571 --> 00:07:17.740
I'm not talking about universal basic income, but this is a different situation.

122
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:23.050
The, the, the crash of Oh eight was caused by many things,

123
00:07:23.051 --> 00:07:24.640
but the government and the banks,

124
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.450
and then stupid people listening to the government and the banks.

125
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.360
That's why that was caused that in greed.

126
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.360
It just caused that thing to melt down. That wasn't my fault.

127
00:07:34.361 --> 00:07:36.970
Why was I bailing out the banks? It wasn't your fault, Dave,

128
00:07:36.971 --> 00:07:41.680
why are you bailing out the banks? This is different. No, nothing.

129
00:07:41.681 --> 00:07:45.190
Anyone did, except for China caused this.

130
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.840
The government turned it off for the first time in history and said,

131
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.050
you cannot go to work. Well,

132
00:07:53.051 --> 00:07:57.820
article five in the constitution says you better get me some money

133
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.310
because you've just destroyed me.

134
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.140
So you have to make me as whole as you possibly can.

135
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.560
So I am for in this particular case,

136
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:13.240
the government coming up with ways to feed money into the system

137
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:18.100
and help those at the lowest rung of the

138
00:08:18.101 --> 00:08:18.880
ladder,

139
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.830
including those small businessmen who are just barely making it now you've

140
00:08:23.831 --> 00:08:27.040
destroyed them. Instead, what we've done is we've,

141
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:31.960
we've taken $7,500 from every American or

142
00:08:31.961 --> 00:08:36.760
16, 16,500 from every taxpayer

143
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.790
$16,000 from every taxpayer.

144
00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.580
And then given some of those taxpayers,

145
00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:47.020
a check for $1,200 that that's, that's not helping.

146
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.110
We taken two and a half trillion dollars,

147
00:08:50.111 --> 00:08:54.190
and only given 355 billion to small businesses.

148
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.330
Where's the rest going? Same place. It went last time.

149
00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.260
<v 2>Right? So with that in mind, is,</v>

150
00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.790
is this just one of these things where our system is so,

151
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.740
is so broken in so many ways that every time we try to do something to

152
00:09:09.741 --> 00:09:14.130
fix it, we just create more problems. Like we, yeah, we extended.

153
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:18.470
So we survive 2008, but then we see, we make to, you know,

154
00:09:18.471 --> 00:09:22.070
banks are too big to fail. What do we do? We make them bigger, uh,

155
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.370
that we just create bandaid on top of bandaid on top of bandaid,

156
00:09:25.371 --> 00:09:27.080
when my hope is that,

157
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.620
that this thing is so profoundly different,

158
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:36.080
that maybe it actually will get people to look at the root causes and think

159
00:09:36.081 --> 00:09:37.040
about it all differently.

160
00:09:37.041 --> 00:09:39.200
Do you think there's any chance or am I just a dreamer?

161
00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.200
<v 0>I think you're a dreamer on that one. Um,</v>

162
