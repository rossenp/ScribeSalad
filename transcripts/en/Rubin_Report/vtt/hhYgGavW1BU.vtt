00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.370
<v 0>When people have me on, they expect me to,</v>

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.850
to make the case for essential workers.

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.170
And of course I do because everybody understands that case.

4
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.230
And when dirty jobs went on, nobody was making that case.

5
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:17.820
So I felt special and I felt like, uh, you know, iconic class out there saying,

6
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:21.540
Hey, don't forget about this one. And this one and this one right now,

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.340
while I still hold them in the absolute, highest esteem,

8
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.130
I'm amazed at how we've taken 35 million people and

9
00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:34.710
deemed them on essential.

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.260
That to me is something I reckon we're going to look back on with

11
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.650
great linguistic embarrassment.

12
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.630
<v 1>The main question that I think I wanted to ask you that I think will sort of</v>

13
00:00:56.631 --> 00:01:00.140
frame everything else we're going to talk about is that there seems to be a

14
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:04.670
narrative out there from a certain set of people, um, that, that it's like, Oh,

15
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.230
going back to work, it's just too risky. And no one really wants to work anyway.

16
00:01:09.231 --> 00:01:13.610
And you know, AOC had some version of this sort of thing. Like only in America,

17
00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:15.800
would we value work so high.

18
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.720
And as a guy that I've seen do the craziest jobs, you know,

19
00:01:20.721 --> 00:01:24.950
where you're stepping in and your hands in this animal, the bats,

20
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.110
electricity water,

21
00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:30.830
you can give me 10 other examples of the crazy things that you've had people.

22
00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:33.740
Do you work with people who are do this for a living?

23
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.200
Can you just talk about just broadly,

24
00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:40.820
like the importance of work relative to finding purpose in life,

25
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.630
relative to just setting up the rest of the things that you want out of life?

26
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.720
Because that actually is one of the things that I'm most worried about right now

27
00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:52.340
that as we sort of give away our day-to-day lives,

28
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.610
that we're going to forget that work is important.

29
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.670
Not I'm not talking about slavery, but I'm just talking about the,

30
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.060
getting up with something to do, because it makes you some money.

31
00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:05.000
So you can do everything else with your life that you want to do.

32
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.950
<v 0>So it's the frog in the boiling water. Uh, I share your fear.</v>

33
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.420
It's not going to happen like a light switch though. Um, what's the old poem,

34
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:16.340
not, not with a bang,

35
00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:21.290
but a whimper and the way it will happen here is people

36
00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:25.400
like AOC and others who genuinely are maybe not so genuinely

37
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.090
believe that work is fundamentally.

38
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.010
Another expression for drudgery are going to make those points.

39
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:34.844
They're going,

40
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.260
they're going to reduce it to something that's purely transactional.

41
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.780
That's that's the first step.

42
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.640
And if you only look at what you do as a means

43
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.350
to make money, then I, then, then,

44
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.030
then you're not an interesting person. Okay. It's just,

45
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.280
it's such a one dimensional way to look at something that

46
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.680
should in my view. And oftentimes does define us,

47
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.020
you know, it's our work. It's a, it's,

48
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:15.490
it's the thing we choose to do with the most conscious

49
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.500
chunk of our life.

50
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.160
And so to reduce it to a paycheck is dumb.

51
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.020
Obviously there's a giant transactional element involved in it,

52
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:30.850
but there's so much more dirty jobs happened because,

53
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.710
because I couldn't follow in my grandfather's footsteps,

54
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.240
which I very much wanted to do.

55
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.190
My pop was a guy who could build up a house without a blueprint.

56
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.110
You only went to the seventh grade,

57
00:03:43.111 --> 00:03:47.400
but he had the chip right in his brain that he could take your watch apart and

58
00:03:47.401 --> 00:03:51.090
put it back together, blindfolded. He could, he could build a house.

59
00:03:51.091 --> 00:03:55.350
He could run pipe. He was a master electrician, steam fitter pipe,

60
00:03:55.351 --> 00:03:58.890
fitter mechanic architect, all of that. Well,

61
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.240
he was heroic in his youth in his time

62
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.500
for those things today, he'd be, uh,

63
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.680
Mr. Cellophane, you know, he's transparent.

64
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.760
And so many of those trades, so many of those,

65
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.230
those vocations have fallen, uh, into,

66
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.730
into this gap between blue and white collar. They've, they've lost their luster.

67
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.620
And we're simply not really gobsmacked the way we used to be about the

68
00:04:28.621 --> 00:04:31.290
miracle of modern plumbing or the miracle.

69
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.990
What happens when you flick the switch and the light comes on. So,

70
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.610
so dirty jobs was meant to be the attribute to my grandfather

71
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.530
initially. And it was,

72
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.820
and then it became a rumination on essential work,

73
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.320
which is interesting, right? Because obviously the headlines have, have,

74
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.350
have caught up with that. And that's really been my great,

75
00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:57.330
good fortune over the years, I do average shows with low production value,

76
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.340
but big themes. And I stick with those themes.

77
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.320
And every couple of years, the headlines will catch up with them dirty jobs.

78
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.610
And the people we featured became weirdly relevant when the economy crashed in

79
00:05:11.611 --> 00:05:16.440
2009 and it's become weirdly relevant this month,

80
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.450
I've been on every talk show. There is to talk about essential work.

81
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.380
And it's funny. I'll tell you what happens. I mean, look, there's a,

82
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.980
there's a poster I keep, but all my Walter reminded me.

83
00:05:28.981 --> 00:05:33.750
I put a pig on a pedestal many years ago for a lot of. And um,

84
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.490
when people have me on,

85
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.140
they expect me to make the case for essential workers.

86
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.490
And of course I do because everybody understands that case.

87
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.520
Now when dirty jobs went on, nobody was making that case.

88
00:05:47.521 --> 00:05:52.110
So I felt special and I felt like, uh, you know, iconic class out there saying,

89
00:05:52.111 --> 00:05:55.830
Hey, don't forget about this one. And this one and this one right now,

90
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.650
while still hold them in the absolute highest esteem.

91
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.390
I'm amazed at how we've taken 35 million people

92
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.990
and deemed them on essential.

93
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.540
That to me is something I reckon we're going to look back on with

94
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.760
great linguistic embarrassment, because.

95
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.420
<v 1>That, that that's exactly what I wanted to ask you next. So continue, continue.</v>

96
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.020
<v 0>No, it's your turn. I just realized.</v>

97
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.100
<v 1>That was the question really like when, once we say to 35 million people,</v>

98
00:06:30.101 --> 00:06:33.520
you're not essential, it's not just about the job that they do. It's,

99
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.550
it's the message that's getting across to their lives,

100
00:06:36.551 --> 00:06:38.980
which in some ways I actually think in some ways,

101
00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:41.740
if they can get through it and then rethink what they do,

102
00:06:41.741 --> 00:06:43.480
maybe there is something else they want to do.

103
00:06:43.481 --> 00:06:45.970
But I don't think that's the message that most people are going to get.

104
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.090
I think we're going to leave people with some sort of existential crisis.

105
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.910
<v 0>We're doing it. It's part of the grieving process. I was saying earlier,</v>

106
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.590
people are coming to terms with the fact that their vocations don't matter in

107
00:06:59.591 --> 00:07:03.910
the eyes of virtually everyone who has a show to host

108
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:05.440
because in our,

109
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.780
in our well-intended enthusiasm to celebrate the essential workers,

110
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.930
we've done a thing we always do with the language. And I am,

111
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:18.400
I am not a politically correct person. I at least I try not to be,

112
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.660
but language does matter a lot. And you know,

113
00:07:22.661 --> 00:07:26.620
in my own foundation, when I feel most comfortably in my own lane,

114
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.780
I talk about education and the skilled trades and higher

115
00:07:31.781 --> 00:07:36.010
education is a turn of phrase that has become inculpated.

116
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.060
And when we talk about the importance of higher education, well,

117
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.500
who would doubt it? Of course,

118
00:07:41.501 --> 00:07:46.480
we need big people with big brains doing important work, but what,

119
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.880
what does higher education imply?

120
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.560
If not the existence of many forms of lower education,

121
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.750
subordinate education.

122
00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:00.670
So the language bakes in a terrible kind of analysis.

123
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.130
If you don't get a four year degree,

124
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.470
if you don't buy into the idea that the most expensive path is the best path for

125
00:08:08.471 --> 00:08:11.590
the most people, then you wind up doing something.

126
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.920
They don't call it lower education, because that would just be crazy,

127
00:08:14.921 --> 00:08:18.610
but they call it alternative. Ah, we have some alternatives for you, Dave,

128
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.740
maybe you'd like it over here in a trade school,

129
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.070
or perhaps you'd be comfortable over here in a community college or in a

130
00:08:24.071 --> 00:08:25.900
fellowship or an apprenticeship.

131
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.300
So we did that in education and the unintended consequences are breathtaking.

132
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:35.920
We're doing it now with the very heart of people's

133
00:08:35.921 --> 00:08:39.220
identities and we're doing it around the simple word.

134
00:08:39.221 --> 00:08:42.820
We're not meaning to do it, but you watch it's,

135
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:46.240
it's going to come back over the net with a lot of top spend.

136
00:08:46.241 --> 00:08:50.200
People are already off about it. I just don't think they quite understand why.

137
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:51.280
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

138
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.280
Let's actually back up for a second and talk about your foundation a little bit,

139
00:08:54.281 --> 00:08:55.890
because everything saying right now,

140
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:58.860
I think does get to a trend that I've been seeing for a while,

141
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.820
which is I've had so many guests to come from academia. And you know,

142
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:06.330
so much of our national conversation is about outrage culture and cancel

143
00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:08.160
culture. And what's happening at colleges.

144
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.580
And now because of YouTube average people.

145
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.340
And I mean that in the best sense of average, all of us can,

146
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.160
can watch incredible thinkers, give lectures.

147
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:20.310
You can watch Jordan Peterson lectures on YouTube for free,

148
00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:23.580
and maybe get more information from that. Then you can,

149
00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:26.490
from a semester that you're paying 25 grand for,

150
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.710
so talk about your foundation and, and sort of,

151
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:31.620
can you just relate that a little bit to what you see happening with higher ed

152
00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:34.380
relative to, if you have a trade right now,

153
00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:38.430
it's like you are essential again, in the best sense of essential. That's not,

154
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:40.920
I'm not putting down the nonessential.

155
00:09:40.921 --> 00:09:43.110
Maybe we can come up with a better word for it right now.

156
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.510
<v 0>Well, we should because everything has a season.</v>

157
00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.640
And part of the reason we're locked in this endless feedback loop of nonsense is

158
00:09:52.641 --> 00:09:55.730
because we're in love with cookie cutter advice.

159
00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:00.620
And so we dispense it with certainty and this is what

160
00:10:00.621 --> 00:10:03.190
politicians do to be elected. They have to, they,

161
00:10:03.191 --> 00:10:06.950
they have to say the thing that's going to resonate with the most people.

162
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:08.570
And so they wind up,

163
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:14.360
they wind up retrenching to bromide and platitudes and tropes.

164
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.280
