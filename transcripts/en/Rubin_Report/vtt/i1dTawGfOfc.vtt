00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.120
<v 0>When we started getting all that money funneling into the country.</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.660
After the end of world war II and the social Democrats were like,

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.000
look at us how good socialism is working. And it had nothing to do with them.

4
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:16.140
In fact, their policies, big government policies, um,

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.310
wasted all that money. And you know, in the 1990s,

6
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:23.430
we actually had to devaluate our currency.

7
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:27.750
I guess 30% of everything was lost because of the welfare state.

8
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:28.584
They built up.

9
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.430
<v 1>If you listen to our, uh,</v>

10
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.270
socialist Democrats or democratic socialists or whatever the hell they are these

11
00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:41.390
days, I keep saying they're going to drop the Democrat part soon enough.

12
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.980
What they always say is we should be more like Sweden. AOC says this.

13
00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:49.040
Bernie says this. I doubt that AOC has ever been to Sweden.

14
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.460
Perhaps Bernie has been to Sweden, but they say the Nordic countries usually,

15
00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:55.370
but it's specifically, we should be more like Sweden.

16
00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:58.400
Now you guys have 10 million people. We have 350 million people.

17
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.190
We have people from every walk of life, from every corner of the earth.

18
00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:04.850
You guys mainly we're a homogenous society into the last couple of years.

19
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.630
There's all sorts of reasons that that analogy doesn't quite make sense.

20
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.900
But when you hear that America should be more like Sweden.

21
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.450
<v 0>Nothing pushes my buttons than when I hear stuff like that. You know?</v>

22
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:21.050
And this comes out of the mouth of what Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren

23
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.260
let's clear this up once. And for all,

24
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.450
Sweden was never a socialist country in the sense that the Eastern block

25
00:01:29.451 --> 00:01:33.350
was, you know, Soviet union so forth. When Sweden became wealthy,

26
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.300
this was during the last part of the 18 hundreds.

27
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.260
We had a bunch of laissez-faire reforms done. And so we that's,

28
00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:44.930
when we started as a transformation to industrialize,

29
00:01:44.931 --> 00:01:48.590
we were actually quite late to the game. It was these, you know,

30
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.350
market free market reforms, right?

31
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.270
<v 1>When you got the government out, laissez Faire,</v>

32
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.310
suddenly the economy starts booming. Okay.

33
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.580
<v 0>[Inaudible] is the name of the guy that was very forward thinking that that made</v>

34
00:02:01.581 --> 00:02:02.840
these reforms possible.

35
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.140
And then things started getting better and better after that.

36
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.250
The other thing you need to remember is that when we started getting all that

37
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.050
money funneling into the country,

38
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.560
after the end of world war II and the social Democrats were like,

39
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.370
look at us how good socialism is working. Yes.

40
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.490
And it had nothing to do with them. In fact, their policies,

41
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.320
big government policies, um, wasted all that money. And,

42
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.210
you know, in the 1990s,

43
00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:34.100
we actually had to devaluate our currency against the 30% of everything

44
00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:37.520
was lost because of the welfare state they built up.

45
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.710
So if you hear Bernie Sanders or Warren say stuff like we need

46
00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:45.950
to be more like Sweden, well, the park they're missing it stuff.

47
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.080
What was good about Sweden was free market oriented. What was bad about Sweden?

48
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.910
We, we turned out into a decent country in spite of socialism.

49
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:56.840
Not because of.

50
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.430
<v 1>Can, can you add to that? I can confirm.</v>

51
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.150
<v 2>That that is true. And you can look it up. It's factual. Yes.</v>

52
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.640
<v 1>When you guys hear that and doing what you were doing, I mean,</v>

53
00:03:08.641 --> 00:03:12.600
as he just makes your head spin, sort of feel like you're going to smack them.

54
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.370
<v 2>Well, I love my job. I really do. Um, because, uh,</v>

55
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.840
I get to people off and I believe what Larry David once said that if you have

56
00:03:21.841 --> 00:03:25.500
the opportunity to annoy someone, you should take it. Uh,

57
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.910
and you are doing that.

58
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:27.960
<v 1>Yeah, you're doing just fine.</v>

59
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.650
But do you think part of the issue here is that the exterior of Sweden looks a

60
00:03:31.651 --> 00:03:35.250
certain way? So for example, uh, I had two trips to Sweden,

61
00:03:35.251 --> 00:03:37.500
to Stockholm and I was only in Stockholm.

62
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.870
So what I'm seeing is a very snapshot version,

63
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.560
but just from walking around Stockholm, or maybe what we see in the media, if,

64
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.990
or in the movies, if they show from someone from Sweden,

65
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.840
they're always very tall, they look very good. You know, they're,

66
00:03:48.841 --> 00:03:51.900
they're blonde like you in their, uh, in nice jackets.

67
00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:54.810
And what I noticed from walking around and Stockholm was it looked like everyone

68
00:03:54.811 --> 00:03:58.830
bought their clothes that morning, everyone looked fantastic. They,

69
00:03:58.831 --> 00:04:02.310
everything was clean. The streets were clean. All of those things. Now I get it.

70
00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:04.950
It's a very small little micro version of this,

71
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.330
but is that part of the problem that the veneer of this somehow is still selling

72
00:04:09.331 --> 00:04:12.480
well or something like that outside of your borders?

73
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.530
<v 2>Absolutely. Uh, I think it's a sort of a Potemkin village.</v>

74
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.430
If you know what that is, there's a, it's a backdrop and behind it, well,

75
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.070
it reminds me of Hollywood that way. Uh, yeah. If you,

76
00:04:25.071 --> 00:04:27.090
if you look at it and informed, it looks good,

77
00:04:27.091 --> 00:04:30.630
but if you look behind the curtain, you, but you don't hide your homeless,

78
00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:33.570
we would hide them. Yeah. Now we can't afford the hide them anymore.

79
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.021
<v 1>Well,</v>

80
00:04:34.021 --> 00:04:37.200
we can't hide them anymore because you're here in California where there pretty

81
00:04:37.201 --> 00:04:37.810
much.

82
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.490
<v 2>Yeah, I have, I have noticed. Yeah. Uh, so no,</v>

83
00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:46.140
but I think just like not speaking out against things you might see as

84
00:04:46.141 --> 00:04:49.740
wrong or incorrect, uh,

85
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.360
it is very important that everything looks good. If you are to have, uh,

86
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.990
a culture of silence and the quasi socialist state.

87
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.300
<v 1>Or how are you guys able to gauge how much effect you're actually having on the</v>

88
00:05:03.301 --> 00:05:04.290
average Swede.

89
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.180
<v 0>I'd say judging by the reactions we're getting from our enemies, uh,</v>

90
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.340
things are going very well. Uh, they get very upset, you know,

91
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.900
funnily enough, like the extreme left people,

92
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.210
they usually do not touch me.

93
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.490
It is the social liberals who are sort of supposed to be like center. Right?

94
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.870
<v 1>Explain a little bit how,</v>

95
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.930
what the differentiation there is for an American perspective,

96
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.500
because I think Americans here that the social liberals and the far left,

97
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:35.840
that sounds sort of like the same.

98
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.260
<v 0>Oh, of course. Yes. Liberal here means a lefty. Whereas in Europe,</v>

99
00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:44.100
the word liberal is moving that direction in Europe as well. Uh,

100
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.620
but it still means more like the classical Austrian liberalism.

101
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.700
<v 1>I'm a European liberal. Yeah. Right. Something like that. Yeah.</v>

102
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.080
<v 0>Yeah. Me too. That's I, I would use the word, you know, fiscally conservative,</v>

103
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.940
but socially liberal to describe myself. Yeah. Um,

104
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.220
so that's where most of the attacks are coming from on my end, you know,

105
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:07.910
from journalists, you know, people have platform, establishment media platforms,

106
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:10.730
they will be very upset and they will find a single word that don't own,

107
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.900
like in a sentence, pull it out and start a tweet store. You know,

108
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.790
they will tell you things like, well, you're dangerous,

109
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:22.070
you're a populistic alarmist. Um,

110
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.180
you're not taking responsibility for what kind of people you take on your,

111
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.950
to your show. And, you know,

112
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.070
going back to this thing with a Canary in the coal mine,

113
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.100
this is the thing because what all of these people have been doing is

114
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:37.910
working so very,

115
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.620
very hard at guiding the population to the correct moral

116
00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:46.490
standpoint at the end of whatever they produce. And when you don't do that,

117
00:06:46.491 --> 00:06:48.290
you bring somebody else on the show and say, okay,

118
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.470
this is a completely different perspective and I'm not going to attack you.

119
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.850
I don't want to fight you.

120
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.170
I want to explore your idea and just see what I make of it. They hate it.

121
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:58.153
They do not.

122
00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.780
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.460
Is there anyone politically that is echoing some of your sentiments

124
00:07:03.461 --> 00:07:04.630
about what's happening in Sweden?

125
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.460
<v 2>Well, honey, if Bali does the job from time to time, when it, his part,</v>

126
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.840
he doesn't try to reign him in which he's part of the moderate party.

127
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.950
<v 0>Which is right-wing the other would be by American standards.</v>

128
00:07:17.951 --> 00:07:20.140
That would be like light.

129
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.380
<v 2>Well.</v>

130
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.260
<v 1>What type of policies would they have just cause I'm trying to get the math,</v>

131
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:26.420
right.

132
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.820
<v 2>Lower taxes, more personal responsibility and individual choice.</v>

133
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.300
They're trying to get it in there, but basically be a conservative or liberal

134
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.790
socially. Yeah. I think they call themselves liberal conservatives, liberal,

135
00:07:39.791 --> 00:07:40.624
conservative. Yeah.

136
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.780
<v 1>That sort of made that jives with me, I suppose.</v>

137
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.010
So I told you guys that when I was in Stockholm for the two shows with Jordan

138
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:52.690
Peterson and I saw you there, um, that they really stuck out. Well,

139
00:07:52.691 --> 00:07:56.680
first off I was ex I was particularly excited about them because I knew that

140
00:07:56.681 --> 00:07:59.920
this small country was my fifth most watched country. And I was like,

141
00:07:59.921 --> 00:08:01.900
what the hell is going on here? So I sorta,

142
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.440
and Jordan also knew that a huge percentage of his viewership was from there.

143
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.220
So we both sort of had that date, that first Stockholm date in our minds,

144
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.770
it's something special is happening. The shows were incredible.

145
00:08:11.771 --> 00:08:13.540
The first show sold out literally in a minute,

146
00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:17.380
which is why we added the second show. The audiences were, were phenomenal,

147
00:08:17.381 --> 00:08:19.600
correct me if I'm, [inaudible].

148
00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:23.350
<v 0>So popular, there was a black market trading and tickets to Europe.</v>

149
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.530
<v 1>I would like to say that it was Jordan. That was very popular.</v>

150
00:08:26.531 --> 00:08:29.920
So just for the record. But, um, the thing that,

151
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:33.370
that truly struck me was that after the show we would do our meet and greets and

152
00:08:33.371 --> 00:08:35.500
Jordan would meet with hundreds of people. Mine,

153
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.020
we would just quickly sell them basically right before the show.

154
00:08:38.021 --> 00:08:39.280
So I'd usually get, you know,

155
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.550
30 or 40 people because we have to do it very quick. But at the,

156
00:08:42.551 --> 00:08:45.760
at the two stock home shows we had about 80 or a hundred people.

157
00:08:45.761 --> 00:08:48.700
We jammed all of these people into a small room.

158
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:53.230
We're sitting there and it felt like something memorable to me.

159
00:08:53.231 --> 00:08:56.160
It felt everyone in that they had questions for.

160
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.710
<v 2>You. You weren't them. They had prepared for you.</v>

161
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.640
<v 1>Everyone in that room had something written down or something on their phone or</v>

162
00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:04.820
something they wanted to hand to me or a book that I should read or a story or

163
00:09:04.821 --> 00:09:08.870
something. And it was, it was so moving to me that I think I said to you, is,

164
00:09:08.871 --> 00:09:10.760
is there a bar around here we can go to?

165
00:09:10.761 --> 00:09:14.840
And we took everybody and we went to a bar and we hung out for hours and I met

166
00:09:14.841 --> 00:09:16.400
some until they closed.

167
00:09:16.401 --> 00:09:19.490
They kicked us out and I met some of the Swedish intellectuals that you guys

168
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.620
hang out with and all these people. Anyway,

169
00:09:21.621 --> 00:09:24.920
I'm not even asking a question here suffice to say that it was so obvious to me

170
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.960
that, that something is going on. And you could just.

171
00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.600
<v 2>Apart from having like an,</v>

172
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:34.300
a disproportionate amount of viewers for such a small country of your show, uh,

173
00:09:34.301 --> 00:09:39.170
and Jordan's, uh, videos, uh, well you caused quite a splash.

174
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.650
