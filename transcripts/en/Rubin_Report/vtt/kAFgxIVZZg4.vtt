WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.990
<v 0>I met the vice president of Pepsi once, uh, vice chairman of Pepsi.</v>

2
00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:06.090
And we became friends. He's a doctor. And, you know,

3
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.180
he had some interesting conversations and I said, why,

4
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.220
why do you guys use high fructose corn syrup? He says,

5
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:13.290
the government makes it too cheap for us not to use it.

6
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.700
<v 1>Wait, let's talk about corn a little bit.</v>

7
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.690
Cause I always the high fructose corn syrup,

8
00:00:20.691 --> 00:00:25.280
what always strikes me as the craziest thing that if you buy a Coca Cola in the

9
00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:29.690
United States, uh, I believe it's the second ingredient in it's water.

10
00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:33.590
And then it's high fructose corn syrup. If you buy a Mexican Coke,

11
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.620
Coke in Mexico or that one that's been brought here,

12
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.420
the second ingredient is sugar. Yeah. How did we in America? We're so advanced.

13
00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:43.280
And yet we can't even do the sugar thing,

14
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.740
even though sugar that [inaudible], I met the vice president.

15
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.320
<v 0>Pepsi wants, uh, vice chairman of Pepsi and we became friends. He's a doctor.</v>

16
00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:54.890
And you know, he had some interesting conversations and I said, why,

17
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.930
why do you guys use high fructose corn syrup? He says,

18
00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:59.840
the government makes it too cheap for us not to use it. There's,

19
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.770
there's all kinds of tariffs on sugar to prevent importing sugar,

20
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.050
to keep the prices, you know, uh,

21
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.970
higher and to actually help corn farmers use their products for the sugar,

22
00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:15.530
which helps Americans. But it also kills Americans. Yeah. Geez.

23
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.023
Yeah. Yeah.

24
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.280
<v 1>You want to screw anyone? I mean, it's just, it's just,</v>

25
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.990
you go to a store and you've got to pay more for the sugar one, then.

26
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.060
<v 0>The core is, is artificially low. Right? So, uh, it's challenging. And I think,</v>

27
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.930
uh, we, we kind of have to look at how do we create, uh, things that aren't,

28
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.630
you know, really, uh, onerous for people,

29
00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:38.660
but that incentivize them to do the right thing and disincentivize them to the

30
00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:42.470
wrong thing. Right. I think that's what, what we do through our tax code.

31
00:01:42.471 --> 00:01:46.550
We can incentivize for our tax code. Why, why do we, for example, pay,

32
00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:51.440
allow the food industry to take a $15 billion tax cut or not

33
00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:56.240
pay taxes on marketing junk food. Why do we do that?

34
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.960
I mean, cigarettes, there's enormous taxes. There's enormous that disincentives,

35
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:03.680
you can advertise. Why do we let them do that? I mean, we can say free speech,

36
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.320
fine, but why should we let them have the benefit of that? Right.

37
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.640
<v 1>So what, what model is better for us? I see what you're saying. So, okay.</v>

38
00:02:10.641 --> 00:02:13.580
We're exporting a lot of this, but where are the places that are,

39
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.830
that have a model that maybe makes a little more sense?

40
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.430
<v 0>Well, I mean, listen, Europe is so far ahead of us. There's no GMO,</v>

41
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.330
half the ingredients in our food that we allow, they don't allow food.

42
00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:24.980
Additives, callers dies.

43
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.050
Something like [inaudible], which is a yoga mat material that is used in isn't

44
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.050
that in the McRib, is that the one that it was in some way, it was in subway 

45
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.050
bonds. It was in a lot of it's in a lot of the fast food bonds. And, and, and 

46
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.883
it's still allowed this country. It's.

47
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.630
<v 1>A real good teacher at a food guy that's supposed to kill.</v>

48
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.500
<v 0>You. That's right. And, and, and, and in Singapore, for example, uh,</v>

49
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.810
which is a very, you know, restrictive country,

50
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.200
if you use that as a food manufacturer in your product,

51
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.520
you get a $450,000 fine. And 15 years in jail.

52
00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.610
And we allow it here, right. Products like D B T, and, and, uh,

53
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.150
and are, are, are preservatives that are not allowed in Europe.

54
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.780
There's a whole list of these in my book of why do we have them here and not

55
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:09.150
there? Uh, and,

56
00:03:09.151 --> 00:03:13.000
and so we had to look at how different countries are addressing this in Europe,

57
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.740
as collectively,

58
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.610
as focusing on regenerative agriculture and changing their system. Chile is an,

59
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:22.150
a great example of a country that has implemented a whole series of food

60
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:26.590
policies that have had great impact in reducing obesity and ill

61
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:29.560
health, which are completely unpalatable in this country.

62
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.330
So the only way it got done was the vice president of the Senate and the

63
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:37.780
president of the country at the same time were doctors,

64
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.530
and they got this and they're like, we're going to fight the food industry.

65
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.091
So they,

66
00:03:42.091 --> 00:03:46.870
they put in a ban on junk food advertising to kids from six in the morning to

67
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:50.470
11 at night, they banned all cartoon characters on kids' food.

68
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:53.200
So no more Tony the tiger, they killed two canned salmon, Tony,

69
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:57.880
the tiger slaughter. Yeah. They put warning labels on the front of packaging,

70
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.800
like cigarettes for bad food.

71
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.280
They eliminated our advertising of formula to kids.

72
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.120
They eliminated any junk food in schools, and they put an 18,

73
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.550
18% soda tax. And,

74
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:14.050
and they they've funded that there's been funding to assess the impact of this

75
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.760
$30 million from Bloomberg actually to fund what this actually is doing.

76
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.620
And they found dramatic improvements.

77
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.770
And the most dramatic benefit wasn't even from the soda tax,

78
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.720
it was from the ban on marketing and the warning labels reduce consumption

79
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.550
four times more than soda.

80
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.510
<v 1>Taxes is the increasing of taxes on these things.</v>

81
00:04:33.511 --> 00:04:36.510
Is that just really a short-term stop though?

82
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.400
Because eventually if you get enough people to stop,

83
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.870
then you don't have the tax money anymore.

84
00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:41.880
And then you might be funding other things with the tax, man.

85
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.430
<v 0>I don't know. I mean, it's, it's been a model that, you know,</v>

86
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.020
is very controversial, but, uh, uh,

87
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.820
Larry Summers and Michael Bloomberg create a fiscal taskforce around the world

88
00:04:50.821 --> 00:04:54.540
of financial finance ministers to look at how do we use financial policies to

89
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.290
change behavior, right? So you, you tax the things you don't want people to do,

90
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.280
and you incentivize the things you want people to do, right? So, so savings,

91
00:05:02.281 --> 00:05:05.520
you don't tax, uh, you know, and maybe soda you shouldn't tax. Right?

92
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.580
And I think that it's been effective across the world. It's just a,

93
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.460
it's just a challenging thing to do with the data is really clear that it works

94
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.280
cigarettes. We do it in cigarettes and we've done it in Berkeley.

95
00:05:14.281 --> 00:05:16.530
We've done it in Philadelphia. We've done it in many, many cities,

96
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.850
but the problem is the food industry fights back. So, so in, uh,

97
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.680
the last election, 2016, four cities in California passed a soda tax.

98
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.770
There are six cities totally, uh, in the country and,

99
00:05:28.771 --> 00:05:30.570
and the food industry freaked out.

100
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.190
So the big soda companies then created a S S a strategy to prohibit future

101
00:05:35.191 --> 00:05:37.230
taxes. So what they did, for example,

102
00:05:37.231 --> 00:05:42.090
they went in California and they created a ballot measure that would prohibit

103
00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:44.580
local taxes, unless it was a two thirds, majority,

104
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.900
which would mean it would cripple local governments to fund schools,

105
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.320
to fund police departments, fire departments. And,

106
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.180
and they didn't care about that, but they spent $7 million funding.

107
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.380
This campaign that would have passed because people don't like taxes, right?

108
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.660
Five days before the election,

109
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.230
they went to governor Brown who was also called governor Moonbeam,

110
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.840
probably the most liberal governor in history. They said,

111
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:13.550
if you don't pass this preemptive law

112
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.640
that prohibits future taxes on soda and junk food,

113
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.030
we're going to leave this ballot measure in and you're going to be screwed.

114
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.900
So he basically was bullied. They made him unquote an offer.

115
00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:27.470
He couldn't refuse like the mafia. And he had to pass this tax,

116
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:31.160
which now prohibits future taxes. And they're doing this in state, after state,

117
00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:35.900
after state. So all this happens behind the scenes, all politics is messy.

118
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.910
Yeah. And so, so as, as consumers, we're sort of like stuck with, uh,

119
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.240
you know, this is system that is perpetuating, uh,

120
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.980
a disease creating system and a disease creating economy. Uh, and it's, it's,

121
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.570
it's threatening our entire way of life. And, and people just don't get it.

122
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.910
It's like, if we don't fix this, you know,

123
00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.050
we're all going to be really sick and fat and get all these chronic illnesses,

124
00:07:00.051 --> 00:07:03.560
which we already are. Our economy is going to be crippled by this. I mean,

125
00:07:03.561 --> 00:07:08.330
think about it. If one, in $2 of our entire federal budget is for Medicare.

126
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.360
I mean, like there's no money for anything else, right? Yeah.

127
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.370
<v 1>All right. So we have sick people suddenly from all of this,</v>

128
00:07:15.371 --> 00:07:17.860
or I guess not so suddenly it's happened over generations.

129
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.910
We've gotten an economy that the incentives are completely out of whack.

130
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.040
Let's talk about that planet thing too.

131
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.060
How is this affecting the planet we've talked a little bit about,

132
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.230
so we talked about some of the.

133
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.320
<v 0>But you know, when people don't realize is that, um,</v>

134
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.650
the very way we grow food is threatening our ability to grow food because of its

135
00:07:35.651 --> 00:07:38.080
impact on our climate and weather. Right? So,

136
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.350
so if you look at end to end our entire food system,

137
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.310
it's 50% of climate change or fossil fuels is about a third.

138
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.720
So it's worse than fossil fuels. Why deforestation? You know,

139
00:07:49.721 --> 00:07:53.770
we kill 7 billion trees a year, the size of Costa Rica, soil erosion,

140
00:07:53.771 --> 00:07:57.880
from our way of farming and the tilling factory farming of animals, food waste,

141
00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:01.570
transport refrigeration, all of these things end to end you add them up.

142
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.800
And it's 50%. The good news is that if that's true, we can fix it.

143
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:11.260
And the UN said that if we took 2 million of the 5 million

144
00:08:11.261 --> 00:08:15.100
degraded hectors of land around the world from overgrazing and from poor farm

145
00:08:15.101 --> 00:08:17.950
techniques, and we converted to regenerate agriculture,

146
00:08:17.951 --> 00:08:21.040
which is a way of farming that we store is and build soil that conserves water

147
00:08:21.041 --> 00:08:24.070
that increases biodiversity, pollinators, et cetera, et cetera,

148
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.920
produces better food, more food, that's more profitable for the farmers.

149
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.790
If we did that, we could stop climate change for 20 years.

150
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.800
And it would cost $300 billion,

151
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.880
which is less than Medicare spends on diabetes every year.
