00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.630
<v 0>Hello.</v>

2
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.890
<v 1>Hello and welcome to the Rubin report. Direct message. I'm your host,</v>

3
00:00:12.891 --> 00:00:16.940
Dave Rubin. It's December 18th, 2020.

4
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.900
And I'm pretending that I'm a network news anchor. How am I doing?

5
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.270
I feel pretty good. All right, guys,

6
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.190
this is our last live direct message of

7
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.560
2020 that's right.

8
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.650
I'm giving my guys off for the remainder of the year.

9
00:00:33.651 --> 00:00:38.600
We've got a bunch of best of shows coming out over the next 10 days or so.

10
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.760
And I'll be at turning point student action summit in Florida giving a talk

11
00:00:43.761 --> 00:00:45.440
on Monday, which we're going to post that talk.

12
00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:48.470
I'll be in front of live human beings. My God,

13
00:00:48.471 --> 00:00:50.720
what a world I haven't been in front of live human beings,

14
00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:53.960
at least giving a talk in front of a whole bunch of them while holding a

15
00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:58.190
microphone, uh, since literally one year ago at this very same event.

16
00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:00.440
So I'm super psyched to be doing that. Uh,

17
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.820
but my guys have been busting their butts, working really hard all year.

18
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.970
The team has expanded in the midst of lockdown.

19
00:01:07.971 --> 00:01:11.030
Actually the two guys that I have in studio right now,

20
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.870
now not to get Garcetti looking at me like I have people in my room right now,

21
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.170
but, but Michael and Connor, uh, both our new hires this year.

22
00:01:18.171 --> 00:01:21.890
So our team has expanded and everybody's worked incredibly hard, you know,

23
00:01:21.891 --> 00:01:25.700
doing stuff remote and now, uh, in a new studio, right?

24
00:01:25.701 --> 00:01:28.490
We started another studio this year, like just so many things.

25
00:01:28.491 --> 00:01:31.550
So I want my guys to enjoy the Christmas break and the end of the year.

26
00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:35.330
And actually one of the things that I write about in Dover in this book is that

27
00:01:35.331 --> 00:01:39.320
if you're ever going to take just a week off of social media,

28
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.410
that Christmas week basically rolling into the new years,

29
00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:47.060
like that's kind of the time to do it right. To focus on food, family,

30
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.380
friends, remember those things. Uh, so that's what I'm mostly going to be doing.

31
00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:53.270
I'm really going to limit all my social media stuff.

32
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.340
I'm going to be posting on the Rubin report community.

33
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.870
So if you want to join us there,

34
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.160
I can have a little more actually human interaction with you guys there.

35
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.920
And as I said, we'll post a couple of videos, but really,

36
00:02:03.921 --> 00:02:07.370
I just want people to kind of enjoy the end of the year. So that,

37
00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:11.350
that is my goal. Uh, it's been a busy day already though, and I've,

38
00:02:11.351 --> 00:02:13.880
I've got a busy day ahead. So we're, we're ended strong.

39
00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:17.300
I was on outnumbered on Fox, uh, this morning already.

40
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:20.540
I think that was at 9:00 AM. Was I on at 9:00 AM? And, uh,

41
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.980
it's four lady hosts and they bring in a guy. I was the guy, uh,

42
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.860
this morning and that, that was fun. And then I'm on, uh,

43
00:02:27.861 --> 00:02:31.160
with Martha MacCallum a little bit later this afternoon,

44
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.180
and we're going to hit a couple of stories here and, uh, then you know,

45
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.910
you'll go about your way. You know what I mean? Simple as that, Oh, by the way,

46
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.250
I do have my trusty glasses today because I may have to give a special

47
00:02:43.251 --> 00:02:47.750
message for somebody. Oh, and one other thing before we get to, uh,

48
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.500
to the main meat of the show today, uh, you know, I talked about, uh,

49
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.060
having alopecia areata yesterday and I showed some pictures of,

50
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.490
at one point I had lost probably about 40% of my hair.

51
00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:02.320
I went under these horrible experimental treatments and just awful, awful stuff.

52
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.130
And I just want to say, I got so many freaking messages yesterday from,

53
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.090
from many of you who not only have dealt with alopecia, uh,

54
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.830
but have dealt with just like all sorts of strange auto-immune diseases that you

55
00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:16.930
chalk up to stress that in many cases,

56
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.010
doctors couldn't figure out exactly why you were breaking out in hives or having

57
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.180
other kinds of skin problems or alopecia or whatever it is. Uh,

58
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.080
and I just want to say,

59
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.070
that's exactly why I try to do this show the way I do it.

60
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:32.470
Because as I always tell you, I'm not trying to make you crazy.

61
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:37.360
I'm not trying to make you nervous or frantic or psychotic or tense or

62
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:41.470
any of those things. Like I'm trying to do this stuff in a, in a palatable way.

63
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.420
Uh, but it's also why I started doing the August off the grid thing,

64
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.040
uh, where I take the month off August.

65
00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:51.520
It's why I think shutting it down as we roll into Christmas and new year,

66
00:03:51.521 --> 00:03:54.850
I think is important. And I hope you guys are just taking care of yourselves.

67
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.140
However you see fit. Uh, but speaking of taking care of yourselves,

68
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:03.820
we have governors in this wonderful country, democratic governors,

69
00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:08.500
people like Andrew Cuomo in New York and Gavin Newsome in

70
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:13.480
California and Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan.

71
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.240
And if you don't remember Gretchen Whitmer, she is the woman who,

72
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:17.950
after a couple of weeks of lockdown,

73
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.930
she announced that people in Michigan should not do gardening and

74
00:04:22.931 --> 00:04:27.340
landscaping outside of their homes, meaning on your own property.

75
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:31.420
She was trying to get people to stop planting plants. Okay.

76
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.600
Literally trying to stop people, planting plants. You may not remember this,

77
00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:37.810
but I actually sent seeds to people in Michigan.

78
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:41.590
We did a little thing on Twitter and I sent seed. So people could plant tomato,

79
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:45.100
plants, cucumbers. I think we sent a, what else did we send?

80
00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:46.270
We send some Brussels sprouts.

81
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:47.710
Somebody told me they didn't want Brussels sprouts,

82
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:50.380
which made me send it to them. Cause I was like, you know, if you can't,

83
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.860
you know, I'm moving seeds here. You're going to take what you can get. Anyway,

84
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:58.120
the point is, she's a ridiculous authoritarian lockdown,

85
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.530
ho and a locked down. Oh, I like that one.

86
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.670
Um, but of course she doesn't abide by her own rules.

87
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.180
In the midst of the lockdown she was seen, uh, on,

88
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:14.110
I believe it was on her boat or a friend's boat for her husband's birthday party

89
00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:16.690
with a whole bunch of friends, no social distancing and the rest of it.

90
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.000
Of course the hypocrisy known knows no bounds.

91
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:23.620
You guys know how all of them flaunt their rules and make you the

92
00:05:23.621 --> 00:05:28.570
peons, uh, live under their boot? Uh, well, Gretchen Whitmer,

93
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.520
uh, she did a zoom with some children from Michigan and, uh,

94
00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:36.460
and Santa Claus. So I don't know how she got ahold of Santa Claus.

95
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:40.150
He's very busy this time of year, but here is governor Gretchen,

96
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.040
Whitmer Santa Claus and the children of Michigan.

97
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.280
<v 2>Thank you for joining us.</v>

98
00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:51.840
I'm governor Gretchen Whitmer and I'm really excited

99
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.850
to be here with all of you.

100
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:59.180
And I also know someone who's been really following the

101
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:03.620
rules and making sure that he stays safe and the elves stay

102
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:08.300
safe. And so my special guest is Santa Claus. Hello,

103
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:10.520
boys and girls. How are you?

104
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.150
Does anyone have a question for Santa Claus? Cinda?

105
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:16.130
Do you have to wear a mask?

106
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.820
I'm in my workshop with all my ELLs,

107
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.240
we all are mashed up in social distancing.

108
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:25.663
How SAC?

109
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.140
Yes, please do carrots and cookies. If you can.

110
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.750
That was a good suggestion.

111
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.830
Everyone has been testing negative. We're still getting tested.

112
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.840
I think we're so far up North that it might not be getting to us,

113
00:06:56.841 --> 00:07:01.700
but are not going to take any chances. We're all gonna mask up.

114
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.800
We're all gonna launch our hands and we're all going to stay

115
00:07:06.801 --> 00:07:08.360
six feet apart.

116
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.600
How can we keep people safe for Christmas?

117
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:16.790
What I would suggest to do,

118
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:21.290
just let the governor is telling all the people of the great state of Michigan

119
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.200
to do social distance,

120
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.150
wash your hands and make sure you wear your

121
00:07:29.151 --> 00:07:31.760
mask when you're outside your home.

122
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.280
And another way to stay safe during the holiday is to stay

123
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.173
home,

124
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:42.950
but call your grandparents and your cousins and your family.

125
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:46.490
And it's the safest way to tell the people you love,

126
00:07:46.491 --> 00:07:48.800
how much you care about them this year.

127
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.830
It has to look a little bit different so we can stay safe.

128
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:55.280
And I appreciate all of you doing your part.

129
00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.980
Phanta thank you so much for making time for us today. Let's hear your boss.

130
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:03.803
Oh,

131
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:08.990
hi everybody.

132
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.720
<v 1>Oh, excuse me. I was vomiting that entire time.</v>

133
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:24.280
I don't like you Gretchen Whitmer that whole thing was so absolutely

134
00:08:24.281 --> 00:08:26.590
staggeringly nauseated.

135
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.580
Okay. There's so much there. The first question,

136
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:38.980
the first question that a child has for Santa Santa's,

137
00:08:38.981 --> 00:08:42.430
do you have to wear a mask? That's what the first question was Santa,

138
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.540
can I have a train Santa? Can I have a shotgun Santa?

139
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.470
Can I have a new governor? Those things, all would've made sense, Santa,

140
00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.380
do you have to wear a mask? Um, then he,

141
00:08:53.381 --> 00:08:56.340
you see this moment where he tells them that all have to stand six feet away

142
00:08:56.341 --> 00:08:58.800
from each other. And then a whole bunch of kids who are all together,

143
00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:02.220
probably about 10 kids at a [inaudible]

144
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:09.060
it, this is such ridiculous propaganda and training

145
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:11.250
children to be obedient,

146
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:16.500
pets by adults who won't even behave by their own

147
00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:17.010
rules.

148
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.720
If you think for even one moment that Gretchen

149
00:09:21.721 --> 00:09:26.520
Whitmer is going to spend Christmas six feet away from

150
00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:31.350
everybody, not with anyone from her home or obeying the rest of the

151
00:09:31.351 --> 00:09:32.460
lockdown orders,

152
00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:36.060
that she would wish that these children's parents would live under.

153
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.430
You got another thing coming. And you know,

154
00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:42.780
I haven't busted out the old newsman glasses in a while, right?

155
00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:43.680
I've busted them out.

156
00:09:43.681 --> 00:09:47.940
I've talked about bill de Blasio special message to Andrew Cuomo,

157
00:09:47.941 --> 00:09:49.350
special message to Eric,

158
00:09:49.351 --> 00:09:53.280
our SETI special message to Gavin Newsome.

159
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.430
But I haven't busted them out in a while. And people have said,

160
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.700
a lot of people have said, Dave, we wish you would bust the glasses out more.

161
00:09:59.701 --> 00:10:01.170
It's a very important message. You,

162
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.590
we put the glasses on and you take them off and you talk directly to the camera

163
00:10:04.591 --> 00:10:06.150
and you lay out a message for these people.

164
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.450
I haven't done it because it's the holiday season. And I've been trying to,

165
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.530
you know, not curse as much and everything else, but I just, here we are.

166
00:10:13.531 --> 00:10:14.520
And it's just, you know.

167
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:21.110
<v 0>Gretchen Whitmer.</v>

168
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:29.270
<v 1>Merry Christmas. Could you be a little bit better? I should've said it.</v>

169
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.590
I should've said it now. I was trying to be nice. I'm trying to be nice here.

170
00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:36.230
You see what they've done as a, as a general rule. I'm a,

171
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:41.060
I'm a pretty nice guy and they've put me in a position of not only am I

172
00:10:41.061 --> 00:10:45.230
now a radical freedom extremist,

173
00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.220
but then I'm also saying these words every now and again. All right.

174
00:10:49.221 --> 00:10:51.380
So that was graduating. America's I'll just

175
00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.140
Michigan governor Gretchen, Whitmer.

176
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.710
<v 0>Go yourself.</v>

177
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.110
<v 1>Joking aside. This is just serious drivel.</v>

178
00:11:09.111 --> 00:11:11.090
Like this sort of training of children.

179
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:15.530
It's so dangerous and this has nothing to do with what the

180
00:11:15.531 --> 00:11:18.820
government is supposed to do, right? Like this isn't,

181
00:11:18.821 --> 00:11:20.510
the government is supposed to protect life, Liberty,

182
00:11:20.511 --> 00:11:23.750
and the pursuit of happiness. It's just supposed to put the guard rails there.

183
00:11:23.751 --> 00:11:26.210
So we're not killing each other out on the streets, that's it.

184
00:11:26.211 --> 00:11:27.380
And it's supposed to get out of our way,

185
00:11:27.381 --> 00:11:30.590
the idea that we're looking to these people as our role models,

186
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.280
or as people who should be telling us what to do and when to do it and who we

187
00:11:34.281 --> 00:11:37.940
can be with and what we can eat and when we can eat where we can go and all of

188
00:11:37.941 --> 00:11:42.860
these things, it's just absolutely crazy. And I, I hope that if nothing else,

189
00:11:42.861 --> 00:11:46.300
if you do nothing else during Christmas, you,

190
00:11:46.301 --> 00:11:50.750
you spend the time with your loved ones and people that you want to be with and

191
00:11:50.751 --> 00:11:55.450
friends and family and all that, and ignore these silly, silly people.

192
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.980
But let's talk a little bit more about lockdowns because I've been saying

193
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.690
something for a couple of weeks here that now I see bubbling up all over

194
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:07.810
mainstream media. Tucker was talking about it last night on Fox news,

195
00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:08.860
Tucker Carlson, of course,

196
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.930
and a whole bunch of other people have been bringing it up.

197
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.400
I hadn't heard anyone saying it.

198
00:12:12.401 --> 00:12:14.860
And then I've said it a couple of times over the last few weeks.

199
00:12:14.861 --> 00:12:18.340
And I think I mentioned it, uh, uh, on Newsmax and maybe on Fox,

200
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:23.320
but one of the very odd things to me about these lockdowns that we're told are

201
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:27.760
so important is that here in California, we've been under a perpetual lockdown.

202
00:12:27.761 --> 00:12:32.020
Everyone's wearing a mask everywhere. Yes, I did. Uh, you know, may a Copa guys.

203
00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:36.070
I walked the dog this morning and I had an illegal haircut yesterday. I know,

204
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.340
I know I'm a radical, what can I tell you? But,

205
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:43.240
but what seems odd to me is if, if these lockdowns work well,

206
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:48.100
I am in the most lockdown state here in California, Florida is open.

207
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:52.690
Texas is basically open shouldn't their numbers be

208
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:57.730
double, triple exponentially, larger, right?

209
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:01.300
Exponentially, more than the numbers in the lockdown States.

210
00:13:01.301 --> 00:13:04.600
If any of this made sense, now not everything is apples to apples.

211
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.140
California has a ton of people. There's weather, things that are different,

212
00:13:08.141 --> 00:13:12.400
but also you could look at Florida, which has an extremely elderly population.

213
00:13:12.401 --> 00:13:14.050
I mean, there there's all sorts of factors,

214
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.080
but the point is that if lockdown as a general rule worked,

215
00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:22.060
wouldn't we see that lockdown States would be going down and open States

216
00:13:22.061 --> 00:13:23.380
would be going up. And in fact,

217
00:13:23.381 --> 00:13:26.590
we see the reverse and it's partly because we're not letting these States that

218
00:13:26.591 --> 00:13:29.710
are locked down, hit herd immunity, and a series of other things.

219
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.740
So the Federalist did an interesting piece on this and, uh,

220
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.110
here's what they said thus far in Florida,

221
00:13:35.111 --> 00:13:39.760
approximately 20,000 people have died of COVID-19 in Texas.

222
00:13:39.761 --> 00:13:43.060
The numbers stands around 24,000 and in New York,

223
00:13:43.061 --> 00:13:47.770
around 35,000, New York is the smallest of the three.

224
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.080
So it's the smallest of those three States.

225
00:13:50.081 --> 00:13:53.380
And it has the most numbers with 19.5,

226
00:13:53.381 --> 00:13:58.090
4 million residents then comes Florida with 21.67

227
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:02.530
before Texas with 28.7 million restaurants

228
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.130
that have residents, not restaurants. There were no restaurants left anymore.

229
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.310
Uh, the reason that I said restaurants is because, uh,

230
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:13.660
we also got an interesting number here, uh, that according to New York state.

231
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.300
<v 0>1.4 0.1 0.4,</v>

232
00:14:18.301 --> 00:14:20.100
3%.

233
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:24.600
<v 1>Of Corona cases in New York have been linked to restaurants.</v>

234
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.740
So really think about this for a moment. We are telling people,

235
00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:33.060
stay out of restaurants, not even outdoor restaurants, sorry,

236
00:14:33.061 --> 00:14:35.370
you built all that outdoor space, which isn't cheap.

237
00:14:35.371 --> 00:14:38.040
And isn't easy to do when you're already hurting financially.

238
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.080
You can't go to restaurants,

239
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:45.030
even though only roughly 1% of the cases have anything to do with restaurants.

240
00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:48.060
We're going to send you back home where then they showed according to their

241
00:14:48.061 --> 00:14:48.894
numbers.

242
00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.190
People are getting more infected at home because around family and friends and

243
00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:53.180
everything else again,

244
00:14:53.181 --> 00:14:56.120
which I think you should be allowed to do it as well within your right.

245
00:14:56.121 --> 00:14:59.210
And you should figure out what works for you and your family.

246
00:14:59.211 --> 00:15:02.780
And if you have elderly people, they're infirmed people or everything else,

247
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.180
there's no such thing as a perfect system.

248
00:15:05.181 --> 00:15:09.950
They can't keep you perfectly safe from an a morphous virus that

249
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.280
eight months ago, we were told two weeks to flatten the curve.

250
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.550
And then I watched the infallible Fowchee. That's my new name for him,

251
00:15:16.551 --> 00:15:20.650
the infallible Fowchee, uh, who should really just be a magician. Doesn't it,

252
00:15:20.651 --> 00:15:21.660
it sounds like a Madrid, but you know,

253
00:15:21.661 --> 00:15:25.550
now the infallible Fowchee who will slice this woman in half,

254
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:31.070
I saw him this morning and he's talking about how, uh, by April,

255
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:35.480
after we have further lockdowns and more masks and everything else by April,

256
00:15:35.481 --> 00:15:37.910
we can start thinking about getting back to normalcy.

257
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.840
Even though now the vaccines are being taken.

258
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.220
I have a friend in, uh, in Texas, you know who you are, uh, who's a doctor,

259
00:15:46.221 --> 00:15:48.380
frontline worker, and he got the vaccine today.

260
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.900
It is up to you in your own personal life.

261
00:15:50.901 --> 00:15:54.440
And with the choices that you think are appropriate for you to figure out if you

262
00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:56.750
want to take the vaccine or not. Okay. I mean, it's just,

263
00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.140
it's just as simple as that, but, but getting to those earlier numbers,

264
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:04.820
New York has a smaller population than Florida or Texas.

265
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.060
Not everything is equal. I get that. Um,

266
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.570
but clearly the lockdowns don't work.

267
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.060
There's no science behind it. Uh,

268
00:16:14.061 --> 00:16:18.530
yesterday we did the story out of San Diego where a judge looked at the science,

269
00:16:18.531 --> 00:16:20.420
he looked at the science and he said, guess what?

270
00:16:20.421 --> 00:16:21.800
We got to open up the strip clubs.

271
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:26.060
Cause there's no science to say these things can be, uh, should be closed. Okay.

272
00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:30.410
So we're really getting to this sort of breaking point where some States are

273
00:16:30.411 --> 00:16:33.110
going to be free and some States are not going to be free.

274
00:16:33.111 --> 00:16:35.870
And speaking of free States, as I said at the top of the show,

275
00:16:35.871 --> 00:16:40.010
I'm heading out this weekend to Florida, I'm going to go see what free people.

276
00:16:40.011 --> 00:16:41.840
I feel like I'm going to another country. I mean,

277
00:16:41.841 --> 00:16:46.460
we've really reduced this lunacy that I feel like when I go to Florida,

278
00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:50.150
which I've been to many, many times, and I've always liked Florida.

279
00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:53.480
And I don't mind the humidity, uh, that I'm going to be in another country.

280
00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:56.630
I'm going to get off the plane and I'm going to see people and they might be

281
00:16:56.631 --> 00:16:58.580
hugging each other or talking to each other.

282
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.720
And I might go to a restaurant and order French fries. I don't know.

283
00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.440
Maybe I'll have a burger or a steak who knows? Well, it's Florida, right?

284
00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:10.340
I have a lot of fish. I like fresh fish. And I'm going to have that in Florida.

285
00:17:10.341 --> 00:17:15.020
And you can't stop me Gretchen Whitmer Andrew Cuomo or Gavin Newsome.

286
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.570
Anyway, it's all just silly nonsense. Uh,

287
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.270
let's just do one other story on,

288
00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.560
uh COVID before I wrap up our last live stream of the year, uh,

289
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:28.520
you guys may remember the newspaper formerly known as the New York times.

290
00:17:28.521 --> 00:17:31.850
It was once thought of as the paper of record in the United States.

291
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:36.710
And really now, if you have a bird parakeet, whatever, it might be,

292
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:39.890
the really the best thing you could use the New York times for is to lie in the

293
00:17:39.891 --> 00:17:43.100
cage. It really has no other purpose besides that. I suppose,

294
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.410
if you were doing papier-mache, do people still do that?

295
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:48.470
Whatever you do with papier-mache and you can create some sort of sculpture or

296
00:17:48.471 --> 00:17:50.280
something you could the New York times for that.

297
00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:54.270
But the New York times is a crap factory of fake news and drivel.

298
00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:55.890
They've called me all right. They've written,

299
00:17:55.891 --> 00:17:58.600
hit pieces around a ton of people that I know we,

300
00:17:58.601 --> 00:18:03.040
we know they constantly lie about anyone. That's a conservative and they,

301
00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:07.920
they cover the crimes and dribble that that comes out

302
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:11.370
of the progressive left. They've completely wholly embraced, uh,

303
00:18:11.371 --> 00:18:12.510
identity politics,

304
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:17.760
a moderate liberal like Barry Weiss had to resign from the

305
00:18:17.761 --> 00:18:22.650
New York times because it has become such a cancerous awful organization. Uh,

306
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:25.770
I know a couple other people that are loosely affiliated with the New York

307
00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:28.110
times. Some of them that are actually there, uh, that,

308
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:30.720
that are constantly talking about how horrible it is.

309
00:18:30.721 --> 00:18:34.280
So the New York times is a, organization,

310
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:38.690
and it it's indicative of how the news and mainstream media has just

311
00:18:38.691 --> 00:18:40.310
absolutely crumbled. Well,

312
00:18:40.311 --> 00:18:44.360
they did a piece this morning and the title of the article in the New York times

313
00:18:44.361 --> 00:18:49.160
is the elderly versus essential workers who should get the first,

314
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.620
who should get currently. Let me start that again.

315
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:55.850
The elderly versus essential workers who should get the Corona,

316
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.090
no virus vaccine. First. Now that's an interesting title for an article.

317
00:18:59.091 --> 00:19:00.140
And there's an interesting,

318
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:05.030
I would say moral and ethical debate about who should get the vaccine first,

319
00:19:05.031 --> 00:19:05.181
right?

320
00:19:05.181 --> 00:19:08.810
We've got frontline workers and bus drivers and delivery people and doctors and

321
00:19:08.811 --> 00:19:10.850
nurses and everything else we've got, you know,

322
00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:14.570
who generally are younger and they're putting themselves out there.

323
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:15.530
So they're more at risk,

324
00:19:15.531 --> 00:19:18.770
but they might have stronger defenses against it and everything else.

325
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.190
So maybe we do that and get it to them first. Maybe we don't.

326
00:19:22.191 --> 00:19:27.110
Then we have elderly people who we know are dying at a higher rate and are more

327
00:19:27.111 --> 00:19:28.790
at risk. So maybe we want to do it there.

328
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:32.540
And we have to figure out where resources go, great, moral and ethical debate,

329
00:19:32.541 --> 00:19:37.100
right? But here's how the New York times framed it. This is just so spectacular.

330
00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.710
Quote, Harold Schmidt,

331
00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:45.230
an expert in ethics and health policy at the university of Pennsylvania

332
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.880
said that it is reasonable to put essential workers ahead of older

333
00:19:49.881 --> 00:19:54.110
adults given their risks. And now here's where it gets good.

334
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:58.040
And that they are disproportionately minorities.

335
00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:02.390
Older populations are wider. Dr. Schmidt said,

336
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:07.130
society is structured in a way that enables them to live longer.

337
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:12.260
Instead of giving additional health benefits to those who already had

338
00:20:12.261 --> 00:20:17.060
more of them, we can start to level the playing field a bit.

339
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.390
Did you catch what he just said there?

340
00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:24.770
Did you catch what Schmidt just said there? I can tell you this, uh,

341
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.630
ethics and what they used to be.

342
00:20:26.631 --> 00:20:29.060
And I don't know what the hell is going on at university of Pennsylvania.

343
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.740
In essence, he is saying,

344
00:20:30.741 --> 00:20:35.060
because some frontline workers who happen to be minorities,

345
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:39.890
we should let grandma and grandpa Whitey, right? Old, white people,

346
00:20:39.891 --> 00:20:43.130
they should just die. You see how,

347
00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.950
what he framed there is so different than what I framed before that if you want

348
00:20:45.951 --> 00:20:49.000
to have the ethical debate about frontline workers versus older people and how

349
00:20:49.001 --> 00:20:50.920
to figure out resources, well, that's just fine.

350
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:55.480
But once you put color ethnicity into the mix

351
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.910
level, the playing field,

352
00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:02.680
that is the most dangerous phrase that I've ever heard related to all of

353
00:21:02.681 --> 00:21:06.520
this, because what he means is yeah, more of them should die.

354
00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:09.220
More white people should die. And by the way,

355
00:21:09.221 --> 00:21:10.990
if you're thinking that this is shocking,

356
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.970
this is just the end of what identity politics is.

357
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:21.100
Identity politics is not about raising certain people based on skin color.

358
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.260
It's about taking down other people.

359
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:28.150
And it literally the end of identity politics is either killing Whitey,

360
00:21:28.151 --> 00:21:32.800
grandma and grandpa, or having laws that will be against white people.

361
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:35.560
It really is. As simple as that, it is as simple as that.

362
00:21:35.561 --> 00:21:37.930
If you take this thing to its logical conclusion,

363
00:21:37.931 --> 00:21:41.620
and I'd like to give a special shout out to you, losers at media matters,

364
00:21:41.621 --> 00:21:45.580
who are undoubtedly watching this and going to selectively clip what I just said

365
00:21:45.581 --> 00:21:50.260
there, but that is the truth. Uh, they go on to say in the article still,

366
00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:52.030
or he goes on to say, still,

367
00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:56.080
some people believe it is wrong to give racial and

368
00:21:56.081 --> 00:22:00.910
socioeconomic equity more weight than who is most likely to

369
00:22:00.911 --> 00:22:05.500
die. Holy balls, man. You're a horrible person.

370
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:10.120
Harold Schmidt, university of Pennsylvania should be absolutely embarrassed.

371
00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:14.440
And you, you have no understanding of ethics. Yes.

372
00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:15.640
Who will die,

373
00:22:15.641 --> 00:22:19.750
should absolutely have more weight than the racial and

374
00:22:19.751 --> 00:22:23.440
socioeconomic equity of a group of people.

375
00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:26.363
<v 3>Right.</v>

376
00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:33.150
<v 1>Okay. You get it guys, you get it. This is, this is what we're fighting. And,</v>

377
00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:38.670
uh, as I, as I wrap this last direct message of 2020, uh,

378
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:42.420
let me just say that this is going to continue.

379
00:22:42.421 --> 00:22:46.890
This stuff is going to continue because it has to get to whatever it's

380
00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.210
awful sort of horrific rock. Bottom thing is,

381
00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:55.140
and it just isn't there yet. And that I think is the unanswered question.

382
00:22:55.141 --> 00:22:58.920
And maybe that will be the question of 2021.

383
00:22:58.921 --> 00:23:03.750
Maybe the real question of 2021 is now that wokeness has just burst

384
00:23:03.751 --> 00:23:08.700
forth into the disgusting grotesque, anti American anti freedom.

385
00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.500
Anti-capitalist thing that it is now that more people get it instead of just the

386
00:23:13.501 --> 00:23:18.030
fringe YouTubers and you crazy people who watch us instead of that,

387
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:22.080
uh, maybe now that more people see it, it eventually will get,

388
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.870
it will destroy so much. That is good.

389
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:29.040
It will destroy company's ability to hire qualified people. It will,

390
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:34.020
it will harm every governmental agency because we'll be hiring transportation

391
00:23:34.021 --> 00:23:37.800
secretaries because they're gay rather than they know what they're doing.

392
00:23:37.801 --> 00:23:41.190
And the litany of other things that you guys know about, right.

393
00:23:41.191 --> 00:23:43.230
That I don't have to talk ad nauseum about.

394
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:48.380
Maybe 21 will be the year that it all comes crashing down on itself.

395
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:51.110
I actually felt that 2020 could have been that year,

396
00:23:51.111 --> 00:23:55.160
but then COVID complicated things in a way that obviously nobody fully

397
00:23:55.161 --> 00:23:59.300
understood. Um, alright on that note folks, uh,

398
00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:03.830
this was officially my last in studio live stream for 2020.

399
00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.020
I have told my guys, you're not going to believe this guys.

400
00:24:06.021 --> 00:24:10.940
I have here an electronic telephone with a video camera on it.

401
00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:13.730
And, uh, over the course of the next 10 days,

402
00:24:13.731 --> 00:24:17.600
I will maybe I'll do some live streams. I may do some random ones. Uh,

403
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:19.220
maybe from the beach, walking down the beach,

404
00:24:19.221 --> 00:24:22.760
I'm going to be in Florida trying to enjoy myself, maybe eating some nice,

405
00:24:22.761 --> 00:24:24.260
fresh fish who knows. Uh,

406
00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:28.430
but I will be spending all of my social media time on the Rubin report

407
00:24:28.431 --> 00:24:31.300
community. So you can go to Rubin report.com if you want to join. And,

408
00:24:31.301 --> 00:24:36.200
and we can share thoughts and share food and recipes and music and all

409
00:24:36.201 --> 00:24:38.690
the other pictures of family and all that good stuff.

410
00:24:38.691 --> 00:24:42.290
And I really do love connecting with you guys. A reminder though,

411
00:24:42.291 --> 00:24:45.170
we do have one more sit-down for the year. Uh,

412
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.540
my last interview of the year is with Adam Carolla,

413
00:24:47.541 --> 00:24:51.530
where we're going to just recap everything that happened in 2020 he's on that

414
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:54.290
short list that I always talk about of sane people. Uh,

415
00:24:54.291 --> 00:24:59.120
so we will recap the craziest year of my lifetime and one of the craziest

416
00:24:59.121 --> 00:25:01.550
years in American history, by the way,

417
00:25:01.551 --> 00:25:03.680
part three of my interview with Abigail Shrier,

418
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:08.750
all about the sudden burst of trans of young

419
00:25:08.751 --> 00:25:11.330
girls who are transitioning, uh,

420
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.910
that's up right now on YouTube and the full part, uh,

421
00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:16.940
the full interview I should say is@rubinreport.com.

422
00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.280
And then we've got a couple year-end compilations.

423
00:25:19.281 --> 00:25:23.420
One is just all my appearances on other shows. And then the other is, uh,

424
00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.980
interviews that I did here.

425
00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:29.240
That's that's pretty much it that's pretty much it.

426
00:25:29.241 --> 00:25:32.300
So my final message to you guys, if, uh, as my,

427
00:25:32.810 --> 00:25:36.560
as we shut down here is, uh, love each other.

428
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:39.980
Love your families be with your families and your friends.

429
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.920
I know it can be tough. I've got versions of it myself,

430
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:47.720
as I keep telling you guys, um, try to cool it on the, on the political thing.

431
00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:49.610
Uh, during this time of year,

432
00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:54.290
it's like we got a lot to be thankful for and a Merry Christmas to you

433
00:25:54.291 --> 00:25:58.280
guys. Last day of Hanukkah. Technically last night was the last candle,

434
00:25:58.281 --> 00:26:01.610
but I guess it rolls into sundown today. Uh,

435
00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.830
and I look forward to seeing you guys in Florida.

436
00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:07.670
I will be at turning point student action summit on Monday,

437
00:26:07.671 --> 00:26:11.510
I'll be doing a couple interviews and, uh, we'll see what else happens. So, Oh,

438
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:12.950
and just more than anything else, just this,

439
00:26:12.951 --> 00:26:15.320
thank you guys for being part of this adventure this year. I mean,

440
00:26:15.321 --> 00:26:19.900
what a wacky year we have all had and everyone, it, everyone, you know,

441
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.100
there were two ways to end this year, right?

442
00:26:22.101 --> 00:26:26.270
You either kind of went completely nuts or, or you lined some things up in life,

443
00:26:26.271 --> 00:26:29.450
right? Like you started like figuring things out or you just sort of went,

444
00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:33.500
went down with the ship. And, uh, and I'm proud to say that.

445
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.920
I think we've done something really good here. You know, we launched this show.

446
00:26:36.921 --> 00:26:39.320
I wasn't even doing this show at the beginning of the year.

447
00:26:39.321 --> 00:26:43.170
We just launched this show in September. As I said, the team has expanded. Uh,

448
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.730
locals is absolutely crushing it. I think we're,

449
00:26:45.731 --> 00:26:49.980
we're fighting big tech in a really effective, good way. And, uh,

450
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.380
I'm just proud of what's going on. And it's all because of you guys.

451
00:26:52.381 --> 00:26:56.340
So thank you guys. Merry Christmas, happy new year. And.

452
00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:00.200
<v 0>I'll see ya in 2021.</v>
