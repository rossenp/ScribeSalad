00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.680
<v 0>I am not surprised to see the end of Trump's at least first four years ending</v>

2
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:07.770
chaotically since that is how they began. And that is how they went.

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.160
And that is why he was elected in the first place to be a disruptor.

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.130
So why are people so shocked that he continues to disrupt?

5
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.190
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

6
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.420
<v 2>All right. This is the Rubin report.</v>

7
00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:27.740
I'm Dave Rubin and we are doing a quick on the fly interview today because I

8
00:00:27.741 --> 00:00:30.890
mentioned on the show the other day, I don't know who to trust anymore.

9
00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:32.870
I don't know. Who's making sense. I don't know.

10
00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:37.100
Who's looking at the world with clear eyes and I went through my mental Rolodex

11
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.040
and Megan Kelly popped up and Megan,

12
00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:44.430
you agreed to do the show just like that. And here we are.

13
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.030
<v 0>I'm doing well for you, Dave. Anytime clear eyes, full heart. Can't lose.</v>

14
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.930
<v 2>All right. Well, here are my notes for today's interview.</v>

15
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.590
<v 0>Oh, are you just like Tony Barrett?</v>

16
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.110
<v 2>You got nothing. Although my guys did tell me, this is,</v>

17
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.930
this is going to enter on Sunday. We're taping this Friday afternoon.

18
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.600
So people will have to bear with, you know,

19
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:09.890
if any little crazy vote got changed or anything else. But generally speaking,

20
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.460
as we tape this on Friday afternoon,

21
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.190
how are you feeling about the state of this election? The media portion of it,

22
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.210
the recount portion of it, Biden and Trump, the whole thing.

23
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.750
<v 0>I have a lot of thoughts. Um, a lot of thoughts.</v>

24
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.800
I am not surprised to see the end of Trump's at least first four years ending

25
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.890
chaotically since that is how they began. And that is how they went.

26
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.280
And that is why he was elected in the first place to be a disruptor.

27
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.910
So why are people so shocked that he continues to disrupt, uh,

28
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:46.910
right up to the last, what appear to be the last final moments of, you know,

29
00:01:46.911 --> 00:01:49.670
his, his, if not his presidency, his, you know,

30
00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:54.230
the time in his presidency before election? Um, I think Trump has lost.

31
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.780
I do. I know people don't want to hear that. Um,

32
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.250
but I think he's lost and I think a lot of people are struggling to

33
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.000
accept it, right? It's like, uh, a grief process. The first,

34
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.990
first step is denial. And I think Trump,

35
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.170
and I'm not saying that he shouldn't get, we should do all the stuff we should.

36
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.780
We should check out what's happening in Pennsylvania.

37
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.380
He should see those legal challenges through.

38
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:17.480
We should make sure we have a Wisconsin, Wisconsin, recount,

39
00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:19.220
and a Georgia recount. Um,

40
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.990
but my assessment from where I sit out here is there are not enough

41
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.950
gettable boats,

42
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.940
even if he can prove fraud or some untoward process with the Malin boats to get

43
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.590
them over the top anymore. It's that that phase has passed. Um.

44
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.340
<v 2>Do you have faith that the numbers that we're getting are real? Like,</v>

45
00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:39.500
do you have faith that not only the people on the ground,

46
00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:43.060
in whatever state you want to pick, whatever city you want to sit, uh, pick are,

47
00:02:43.061 --> 00:02:46.340
are being honest. And that is being translated to us, honestly,

48
00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:48.050
through the media. Do you have faith in that?

49
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.320
<v 0>Not utter faith, but enough faith. I mean,</v>

50
00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:56.270
these are the same people who did the count four years ago and he won. So let's,

51
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.340
let's be real. They didn't just become, uh, you know,

52
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.930
vote counters in the past four years.

53
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.850
And they also hated him four years ago. It's not like they loved him.

54
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:08.500
They thought he was going to be full of love and rainbows.

55
00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:12.400
When he got into office, they wanted to kill him four years ago. And you know,

56
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:14.920
Philadelphia is famous for its voter fraud. And so like these,

57
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.430
these problems have existed long before now.

58
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.220
And what I'm seeing in the electoral process is it, to me,

59
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:24.550
it's akin to like when we went HD in television,

60
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:28.030
where everything looked just fine when it was like, there's a little fuzzy.

61
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:30.370
And then like, when you could see it up close and personal, it was like,

62
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:33.850
my eyes were like, God, I didn't want to see this as serious.

63
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.690
And that's what's happening with our electoral process. It isn't perfect.

64
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:41.170
It's far from perfect. It's the best we have. Should we do better?

65
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.550
Can we do better? Yes. And yes. Hello Florida. Let's just be like Florida. Um,

66
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.440
but we're not right now and we're not going to get it to the point of, ah,

67
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.970
now it's perfect.

68
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.660
And we can perfectly know that every vote that was proper was counted and

69
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:58.810
everyone that wasn't was not, it's not going to happen. People.

70
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.550
That's not the way our system is built.

71
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.930
So we're going to have to do good enough. That's how the system set up. And the,

72
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.670
even the votes he's counting,

73
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.460
even the ones he's like that was fraudulently filled out. Or that's Bubba,

74
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.850
you're talking about handfuls handfuls here and there. You know,

75
00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:15.700
you're not talking about 70,000 votes.

76
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.960
That's going to get him over the top and Arizona, that's not going to happen.

77
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.101
And you know,

78
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:25.360
the places where it's tightest Biden is a hit Biden is a head right now in

79
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:27.700
Georgia. Biden is ahead. Um,

80
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.580
in a couple of these States that Trump is contesting.

81
00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:35.500
So I just think the odds of Trump turning this around right now

82
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.760
are infant testimony. And so re I'm not saying it's totally impossible,

83
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.610
but realistically, if you want to know what I think,

84
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.390
I think he's lost and I don't think his legal challenges or the recounts are

85
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:47.403
gonna amount to much.

86
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.680
<v 2>Yeah. So, so what do you think he'll do,</v>

87
00:04:49.681 --> 00:04:53.070
do you think he just runs the table with every legal recap, every,

88
00:04:53.071 --> 00:04:56.280
every legal course of action and just does absolutely anything,

89
00:04:56.281 --> 00:04:59.520
or do you sense that maybe at some point, if what you're saying is right,

90
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.200
that he will throw in the towel.

91
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.680
<v 0>I know throwing in the towel doesn't sound like Trump. And, uh,</v>

92
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.680
I also think he owes it to his supporters who love him and,

93
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.360
and don't trust these systems for good reasons to see these challenges through.

94
00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:15.090
I have no problem with him stoking those fires and getting in there and making

95
00:05:15.091 --> 00:05:19.290
sure to the extent he can, maybe it's his final act as president,

96
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.150
right before his lame duck period to like disrupt yet another system to upend

97
00:05:24.151 --> 00:05:27.480
it, blow it up and ultimately make it better, right.

98
00:05:27.481 --> 00:05:31.800
Tear it down so we can come back better for the next four year period. Um,

99
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.360
but I, I support his, his willingness to challenge these, you know,

100
00:05:36.361 --> 00:05:38.910
where he has good faith evidence of a problem,

101
00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:42.540
like what happened in Pennsylvania with allowing the Malin votes to be

102
00:05:42.541 --> 00:05:43.920
postmarked on election day,

103
00:05:43.921 --> 00:05:48.630
something that was approved by judges and not legislators, which is not okay.

104
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.960
The court refused to take that challenge. They said,

105
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.640
get back to us if this becomes an ongoing problem after the election.

106
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.190
And if there's a split in the States that we might have to resolve,

107
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.540
he should pursue that. You should. But again,

108
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.200
it doesn't look like there are enough votes in that pile that could help him

109
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.240
anyway. I think he should see it through,

110
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.780
I don't think you should give up before he has to, but I think realistically,

111
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.850
when it becomes clear that he's lost,

112
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.300
we're going to need the people who are closest to him, who he trusts,

113
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.710
not the media, which he doesn't for good reason to sit him down and say,

114
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.460
it's no longer about you. This is about the country.

115
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.850
And there will be a peaceful transfer of power.

116
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.770
And while you can go out there and say,

117
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:30.800
I have real problems with the way the system conducted itself.

118
00:06:30.801 --> 00:06:32.150
And I don't know about this vote.

119
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.250
I am going to pass the torch and put America first to quote

120
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.660
somebody. We all know.

121
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.260
<v 2>Do you think that part of his calculation of, of even if he sees it,</v>

122
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.720
that he's lost, like the challenges aren't going anywhere?

123
00:06:46.721 --> 00:06:50.560
That part of it will be the burn it down thing, because you know,

124
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.830
even just a few minutes before we started here, I saw a tweet by AOC and,

125
00:06:53.831 --> 00:06:57.340
you know, in, in effect, you know, we're going to have to come for Trump. And,

126
00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.790
you know, they keep saying enablers and the sycophants and whatever.

127
00:07:00.791 --> 00:07:03.280
And it's like, you know, a few weeks ago, Robert Rice,

128
00:07:03.281 --> 00:07:06.730
who was in the Clinton administration talking about a truth and reconciliation

129
00:07:06.731 --> 00:07:11.230
commission and that these people love lists and all of these weird things.

130
00:07:11.231 --> 00:07:14.710
And it's like, for all the chance of lock her up, it never happened.

131
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.431
There was no,

132
00:07:15.431 --> 00:07:18.520
there was nobody knocking on Hillary's door and that Trump may feel.

133
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.850
And I think actually for good reason that, that these people,

134
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.040
whether the guy did anything illegal or not,

135
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.340
they've created this monster in their heads, let's say,

136
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.690
and that they will do things that are unimaginable in,

137
00:07:30.691 --> 00:07:32.320
in the American political landscape.

138
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.290
<v 0>Well, I think, yes, they will.</v>

139
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.200
It's not paranoia when they really are out to get you.

140
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.050
And that explains a lot of Trump's behavior. I mean,

141
00:07:41.051 --> 00:07:45.460
I think the media is like so disgusted by his rhetoric from the white house.

142
00:07:45.461 --> 00:07:47.560
And they're like, it's not great. I'm not going to defend it,

143
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.540
but I understand where he's coming from.

144
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.470
They have been out to get him for more than four years.

145
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.660
The media is his enemy. They absolutely are his enemy.

146
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:03.700
And the Democrats load him in a special

147
00:08:03.701 --> 00:08:04.534
way.

148
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:09.040
And one does have to wonder if a lot of these Democrats think the ends justify

149
00:08:09.041 --> 00:08:10.410
the means. I mean, th we,

150
00:08:10.411 --> 00:08:14.380
we really have had a baseless attempt to impeach the guy

151
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.630
that was right on the heels of a completely made up Russia

152
00:08:19.631 --> 00:08:24.520
investigation and not to mention all the non controversies the media fed

153
00:08:24.521 --> 00:08:29.080
off of for the last four years. So he is right to totally distrust them.

154
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.350
The pollsters have had it totally wrong when it comes to Trump all along.

155
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.370
I do want to make a distinction between the pollsters who predict vote prior to

156
00:08:36.371 --> 00:08:40.870
the vote and the people at the decision desks who analyze for a living

157
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:44.860
raw vote tallies, two totally different animals. Okay.

158
00:08:44.861 --> 00:08:48.310
So just because we don't trust the pollsters like Nate silver doesn't mean we

159
00:08:48.311 --> 00:08:51.100
shouldn't trust the Fox news decision desk, but anyway,

160
00:08:51.101 --> 00:08:55.180
Trump has a general distrust of the systems that's well-founded.

161
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.510
And so, and I, and so to his fans,

162
00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:00.000
and that's why I think people aren't being nuts right now.

163
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.160
It's not crazy conspiratorial people like no one,

164
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:06.750
but it's based on data it's based on experience. And, uh,

165
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:11.310
and to expect the left, to understand any of that is too much to expect.

166
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.460
They won't there isn't grace on the other side. I mean, there's,

167
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.490
there's great guys like Andrew Yang, right? Who's saying all the right things,

168
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:20.370
like be cool. And like, let's not go too far and whatever.

169
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.090
And then there's just jerks like AOC or Nancy Pelosi coming out and saying,

170
00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:26.920
we have a mandate, which you don't even have close to a mandate. And,

171
00:09:26.921 --> 00:09:29.370
and one other point on her, the more you say, you have a mandate,

172
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:32.460
which you've clearly do not lost how seats instead of gaining them,

173
00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:34.140
it looks like you're not going to have control of the Senate.

174
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.560
You didn't get the blue wave at the federal at the presidential level.

175
00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.450
The more the Republicans,

176
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.440
if they do take over that Senate are going to do to stymie every piece of Joe

177
00:09:43.441 --> 00:09:46.560
Biden's agenda. There will be no grace on their side either.

178
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.390
