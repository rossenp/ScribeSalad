WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.130
<v 0>Yeah. So in 2007,</v>

2
00:00:02.131 --> 00:00:07.110
I was 13 years old and we didn't have anything to eat anymore.

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.920
So we were thinking, what do we do? You know,

4
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:13.200
there were tons of people dying from starvation,

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.120
and I was fortunate enough to live on the border town of North Korea.

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.990
So I was able to see the lights coming from China's side.

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.320
So if you look at the satellite photos of North Korea,

8
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.780
it is like the literary darkest place on earth.

9
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.630
You don't have interesting nights.

10
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.280
So I was looking at China and then wondering maybe if I go where the lights

11
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.800
were, I might find something to eat.

12
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.380
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

13
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.540
<v 2>I'm Dave Rubin, and this is the Rubin report.</v>

14
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.070
Joining me today is a human rights activist author of in order to

15
00:00:52.071 --> 00:00:56.930
live a North Korean girl's journey to freedom and someone that I'm honored to

16
00:00:56.931 --> 00:01:00.350
call a friend beyond me park, welcome to the Rubin report.

17
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.850
<v 0>Thank you so much for having me. It's a real honor to be on your show.</v>

18
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.640
<v 2>Um, I'm thrilled to have you, can I call us friends?</v>

19
00:01:07.641 --> 00:01:11.570
We've only hung out one time and just in the last few weeks,

20
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.570
but I feel that we are long lost friends.

21
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.430
<v 0>Definitely. I've been following,</v>

22
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.310
you're almost like stuck in here for the last three, four years.

23
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.870
I've been to your show with the Joe Jordan Peterson in Chicago,

24
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.620
and I wasn't even one of the audience. So yeah.

25
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.130
<v 2>Well, I, I do consider you a friend and I, and I'm thrilled.</v>

26
00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:32.800
You're here because your story is,

27
00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:36.290
is just absolutely incredible.

28
00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:38.510
And you've become a fighter for so many of the things that,

29
00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:39.860
that this show is about.

30
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.990
So let's just start at the beginning for people that don't know you.

31
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.440
Uh, let's just, let's just do your biography. Just,

32
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.750
just tell me your story and then we'll go from there.

33
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.461
<v 0>Right? Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:56.990
So I was born in the Northern part of North Korea in end of

35
00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:58.400
1993.

36
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.530
So that was right after Soviet union collapsed and North Korean regime stopped

37
00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:07.760
providing ration to the people. So because in the socialist system,

38
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.560
the trading is illegal. And if the government doesn't give you food,

39
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.450
what do you do? We staff death. And unfortunately, that's when I was born,

40
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.140
when North Korea began going into this thing called like the, you know,

41
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.920
I mean the worst family in human history in 21st century,

42
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.640
I was going in North Korea. I had a father,

43
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.510
my mom and my sister in a very ordering hassle word.

44
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.770
And I had no clue that North Korea was, uh, you know,

45
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.180
her making the one where the country is truly isolated.

46
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.880
We don't even know what isolation means.

47
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.140
And growing up in North Korea, of course it was, uh, you know,

48
00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:52.970
we didn't have a word for love. We didn't have a role for Liberty.

49
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.340
We didn't have words for a lot of, uh, things.

50
00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.330
<v 2>So you were 13 when your family decided to leave</v>

51
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:02.164
North Korea, is that right?

52
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.880
<v 0>Yeah. That's me gay from North Korea.</v>

53
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.820
It wasn't like you're getting a passport. Yeah.

54
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.770
<v 2>Right. Escape escape is a much better word.</v>

55
00:03:10.771 --> 00:03:13.170
So can you just tell us a little bit about what that was like?

56
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.320
<v 0>Yeah. So in 2007,</v>

57
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.300
I was 13 years old and we didn't have anything to eat anymore.

58
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.110
So we were thinking, what do we do? You know,

59
00:03:25.111 --> 00:03:27.420
there were tons of people dying from starvation.

60
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.310
And I was fortunately enough to live on the border town of North Korea.

61
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.180
So I was able to see the lights coming from China side.

62
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.540
So if you look at the satellite photos of North Korea,

63
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.000
it is like the literary darkest place on earth.

64
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.820
You don't have interesting nights.

65
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.580
So I was looking at China and then wondering,

66
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.990
maybe if I go over the lights or I might find something to eat,

67
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.210
and that was the motivation why we risk our life to escape from China. I mean,

68
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.103
North Korea.

69
00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.310
<v 2>Yeah. And your story of, of actually how you did it is pretty incredible.</v>

70
00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:03.630
So you have to tell that to everyone.

71
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.660
<v 0>Where we, I was,</v>

72
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.610
we had to cross a frozen Weaver to China and they are like every

73
00:04:11.611 --> 00:04:14.280
10 meters, the border guards with the machine guns.

74
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.500
Now the North Korea buried the landmines and electrify the wire fences

75
00:04:19.501 --> 00:04:23.700
to prevent people to stay. However, when we were escaping,

76
00:04:23.701 --> 00:04:26.520
we had a person, a human trafficker,

77
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.330
she sold us two Chinese human traffickers.

78
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.440
And that's how we were able to safely cross the border to China.

79
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.370
<v 2>Did you guys know what was going to happen to you? I mean,</v>

80
00:04:38.371 --> 00:04:41.670
I know you were just a kid, but did, did your parents at that point? No.

81
00:04:41.671 --> 00:04:44.100
You're being sold to human traffickers and I know you'll,

82
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.450
you'll tell what happened next,

83
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.080
but did your parents have any idea what that meant or, or it was just like,

84
00:04:49.081 --> 00:04:52.050
we have to get there no matter what is about to happen to us.

85
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.410
<v 0>So it wasn't like my parents deciding it.</v>

86
00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.330
My sister escaped a few days before me and I was in the hospital

87
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.980
and you know, North Korean hospitals, we don't of course have x-rays or nothing.

88
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.940
The doctor is like, no touching my tummy and told me,

89
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.080
you might have some bursting of appendix and we have to operate on you this

90
00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:17.070
afternoon. And they'll of course, call my belly without any anesthesia.

91
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.610
And they realized it wasn't like appendix.

92
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.900
It was just malnutrition and infection. So I couldn't go with my sister,

93
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.950
but she left me a note to say, go find this lady.

94
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.550
And she will help you to go to China. And when I saw that letter,

95
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.950
I told my mom like, mom, you got to come me to me.

96
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.720
I couldn't leave my father who was very sick. So it was, uh,

97
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.990
I took my mom to get me in the mirror, crossing that river.

98
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.100
We didn't even know the word human trafficking. Like it wasn't something,

99
00:05:47.101 --> 00:05:49.860
a concept I was aware. Right. Thing. It's like,

100
00:05:49.861 --> 00:05:52.440
I didn't even question why the person was a happiness.

101
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.710
I was so desperate and I wasn't, he didn't really matter if me,

102
00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.260
if I was only a kid in China, my fate in North Korea was death. Anyway.

103
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.050
So really matter what it was.

104
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.600
<v 2>Yeah. Do you think your mom knew what,</v>

105
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:08.710
what was about to happen when you got there to China?

106
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.000
<v 0>No clue. She also had abs, so in North Korea, we don't,</v>

107
00:06:13.001 --> 00:06:14.890
we have like one channel on TV,

108
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.570
which is all propaganda and we don't have internet. And there is only,

109
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.580
we don't have one newspaper.

110
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.610
We do not have any else of information coming in.

111
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.100
So I never even seen the map of the word.

112
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.730
I had no clue the different races existed.

113
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.420
I did not even know what Africa was in North Korea.

114
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.950
The regime taught me that I was,

115
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.190
in some ways they didn't tell me that I was Asian.

116
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.440
So I didn't really know how many countries existed or none of the us or

117
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.710
North Korea. So she, of course, in the nano,

118
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.350
we just went there and found out what it was.

119
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.161
<v 2>Yeah. Okay.</v>

120
00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:56.140
So you get to China and I think you probably thought you were going to

121
00:06:56.141 --> 00:06:58.900
be safe, but that's not exactly how that worked out either.

122
00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.160
<v 0>Yeah. So I was 13 and crossing is frozen.</v>

123
00:07:03.161 --> 00:07:06.640
We were with mom and the human traffic we're us to go there.

124
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.560
And as soon as the first thing I was seeing was my mom waved involve me

125
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.000
and I was 13. And in North Korea, we don't have any sex education.

126
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.900
So I didn't even need to know what that was.

127
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.110
Didn't even know that was a rape horrible.

128
00:07:23.111 --> 00:07:27.280
And I couldn't believe what was happening. And then they told us later,

129
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.370
they were like negotiating our price in front of us.

130
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.250
And they talk about a slave markets exactly like that.

131
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.350
They stored in my mouth for one $65 in 21st century right

132
00:07:38.351 --> 00:07:41.950
now. And I was above $200.

133
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:46.830
They bought me because I was a Virgin and I was young and they sold us

134
00:07:46.831 --> 00:07:49.540
separately to different human traffickers. Right.

135
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.810
<v 2>And then what I feel like this whole interview, I could just say to you,</v>

136
00:07:52.811 --> 00:07:56.050
and then what, and then what, because it's such a, it's such a series of things,

137
00:07:56.051 --> 00:07:58.750
but I think it's important for people to really understand all these steps.

138
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.300
<v 0>So as soon as they were separating mom and me, and, you know,</v>

139
00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:07.270
even I was like 13 mine, I didn't care. They were like,

140
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.330
they want to make more money out of us than splitting us.

141
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:15.010
They told us to me to another human trafficker, he was like a hand Chinese.

142
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.410
And he of course tried to rape me. And I was trying to kill myself.

143
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:24.820
I was, I couldn't take it anymore. So I was trying to kill myself. And he said,

144
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:30.100
if I become his mistress and he would become buying my mom

145
00:08:30.101 --> 00:08:33.100
and bring my family to me, I was in a way,

146
00:08:33.101 --> 00:08:37.210
very lucky that I found the trafficker who wanted to help me that way.

147
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.080
So at third, and I thought like, okay, if I become his mistress,

148
00:08:41.081 --> 00:08:45.100
I can sell my family. And I get to become his mistress.

149
00:08:45.101 --> 00:08:48.790
He raped me and did it bring my money back?

150
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.760
He bought my mom from the farmer he sold to.

151
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.220
So because of the U2 one child policy in China right now,

152
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.460
there are more than 30 million men cannot find the wives.

153
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.200
North Korean women are IP demanded by these men.

154
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.690
And so there's a sexual slave STEM.

155
00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.030
<v 2>Did. Did, did you think your life was better at that point? Like,</v>

156
00:09:11.031 --> 00:09:14.390
did you feel better now, suddenly you had seen a wider world,

157
00:09:14.391 --> 00:09:17.030
but horrific things were happening to you. I mean,

158
00:09:17.031 --> 00:09:20.480
the rape of your mom rape of you, you were, it's not that you were free.

159
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.780
Like what, what did you think at the time in terms of like, was,

160
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.610
were things better? Was it worth going?

161
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:32.060
<v 0>I stopped feeling things. The thing through my therapy,</v>

162
00:09:32.061 --> 00:09:36.520
that's like my struggle and not trying to feel again, like at 13,

163
00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:40.370
somehow I just learned not to fear. So it wasn't like I was thinking about,

164
00:09:40.371 --> 00:09:42.110
am I happy? Or like, it wasn't like that.

165
00:09:42.111 --> 00:09:45.860
It was like every second of a survivor and trying to

166
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.560
get called by Chinese authority because they were like looking for us like every

167
00:09:51.561 --> 00:09:52.394
second.

168
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:55.520
