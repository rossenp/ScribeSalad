00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.110
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.380
<v 1>Far left. Lunacy is hitting every corner, though. New radical,</v>

3
00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:16.640
extreme democratic party.

4
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.910
Look at the city of San Francisco handling the pandemic.

5
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.160
They given out free drugs and alcohol and weed and cigarettes to homeless

6
00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:28.610
people to help them stay quarantine, Congressman a Casio,

7
00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:32.630
Cortez she's outraged or fainting. It slamming jet blue.

8
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.220
They did a New York city fly over honoring first responders and frontline

9
00:00:37.221 --> 00:00:41.870
healthcare workers tweeting out nothing like a corporate PR campaign that

10
00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:46.520
burns jet fuel at low altitudes over vulnerable communities,

11
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.250
dying from a respiratory virus, uh,

12
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.620
Congresswoman one of you as Nancy Pelosi,

13
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.760
how she goes back and forth from San Francisco and whether or not she uses a

14
00:00:55.761 --> 00:01:00.620
private jet. Ask her that here with reaction author of don't burn this book,

15
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.480
Dave Rubin, Salem nationally syndicated radio host, Larry elder, Mr. Rubin,

16
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.320
really weed booze cigarettes.

17
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.800
Maybe I want to be homeless cause I probably could use all of them at this

18
00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:14.150
point. Not that I use drugs.

19
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.110
<v 2>Sean, they're really onto something up there. I mean,</v>

20
00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:21.620
let me get this straight so you can get drunk. Then you can get stoned.

21
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.820
Then you get the munchies.

22
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.790
Then you swing on over to Pelosi's for some ice cream. I mean,

23
00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:30.440
I think San Francisco has got some sort of new economic thing working out right

24
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:34.130
now, but the whole things, of course it's nuts. Look my good friend,

25
00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:37.340
Larry elder and I were here in Los Angeles. I mean, quite literally,

26
00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:41.420
I can't bring a bottle of wine to Larry's house, house and us have a drink,

27
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.320
but we're going to give booze and weed to homeless people.

28
00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:48.770
I'm not even against booze and weed. Okay. But it's just crazy.

29
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.850
This is just typical San Francisco stuff. Larry.

30
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.890
<v 1>I don't think I could have made this up.</v>

31
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.230
<v 3>You really can't but this is California Shaun. This is,</v>

32
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.910
this is a one party state there isn't a single Republican who holds an office

33
00:02:04.911 --> 00:02:06.740
statewide. They've gotten majority.

34
00:02:06.741 --> 00:02:09.470
It's not just majorities in both houses of the legislature. Sean,

35
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.180
they've got super majorities.

36
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.330
This is a town that gives elite a state that gives illegal aliens.

37
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.790
In-state tuition. Something that your kid couldn't get.

38
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:19.400
If your kid got into UCLA or USC.

39
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.150
So why should anybody be surprised you can deprecate in the streets and in

40
00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:23.960
California,

41
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.280
as long as you're not cutting it clutching a bunch of banned plastic straws.

42
00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:29.070
You're good to go.

43
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.130
Make sure you're wearing your face mask while you're doing it.

44
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.640
<v 1>Yeah. All right. So what happens? You just get online.</v>

45
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.590
How do you get your free weed, booze and cigarettes? Uh, the, uh, Ms. Dave,

46
00:02:39.591 --> 00:02:40.424
how do we do that?

47
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.940
<v 2>I love that. I love that concept. It's like,</v>

48
00:02:43.941 --> 00:02:46.760
do you have to prove you're homeless somehow? I mean,

49
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:49.340
I thought these are the same people that are against IDs.

50
00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:50.930
How do you prove you're homeless?

51
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.020
So you can show up to get the weed and the booze. I mean,

52
00:02:54.021 --> 00:02:58.130
none of it makes sense, but it's so consistent with progressive policies.

53
00:02:58.131 --> 00:03:01.030
I mean, look Gavin, who's our governor here. I mean, elder,

54
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:01.990
we gotta get out of here.

55
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:04.360
Can we talk after the show we got to get out of this state.

56
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.690
You guys got to get out of there, man. We shouldn't be surprised.

57
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.580
I've got to get out of, Oh, let's see.

58
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.470
<v 1>And the COVID patients to nursing homes to infect everybody. That's vulnerable.</v>

59
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.100
That's the state I live in Larry. Last word. Absolutely.

60
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.050
<v 3>This, this is where we are. Uh, my, my two-step solution, the same California.</v>

61
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.740
Sean, keep the illegal aliens, deport the Democrats.

62
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.950
<v 1>All right, go run. Thank you. Both. Congrats on the book, Dave.</v>

63
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.550
