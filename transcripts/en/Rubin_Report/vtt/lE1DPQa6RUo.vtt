00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.860
<v 0>Hello, how are you?</v>

2
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.760
<v 1>What's going on? What's new.</v>

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.140
How's the family how's work. How's the country.

4
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.550
I'm Dave Rubin. It's November 6th, 2020.

5
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.800
We are three full days.

6
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.900
Post-election and we still don't have a winner. We'll unpack that.

7
00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:33.470
And more on today's episode of the direct message. All right, guys,

8
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.340
a lot to talk about, uh, I'm not going to bludgeon you with stats today.

9
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.710
I've been trying not to do that anyway. Uh,

10
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.090
but I'm going to try to analyze a little bit of what could possibly happen in

11
00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:48.710
the future. And we'll kind of go from there. I'm going to do a little bit on,

12
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.270
uh, on some media coverage.

13
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.340
And then I do want to talk about one sign that I hope most people would see

14
00:00:55.341 --> 00:00:56.660
as good either way,

15
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.610
which is that the gay vote did shift a lot. Uh,

16
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.420
even if you're a lefty gay, I hope that you wouldn't want, uh,

17
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.650
gay people to only have to vote for one party as if the entire gay community is

18
00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:12.650
a monolith and must think the same way. Uh,

19
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.500
although that's generally how they think about these things. Uh,

20
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.120
so we'll break down some of those numbers.

21
00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:20.810
I mentioned some other numbers in the last couple of days about how Trump did

22
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.820
actually shockingly well within the Muslim community and the Latino community.

23
00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:27.170
And we're seeing all sorts of,

24
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.880
of interesting things that have maybe changed the demographics of the way the,

25
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.570
uh,

26
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.320
parties actually look at who they have to go after and how they have to go after

27
00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:36.740
them.

28
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.420
But obviously all of that is secondary to the fact that we don't know who

29
00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:45.350
won the election, uh, in case you forgot on Tuesday night,

30
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.120
it was looking really good for Trump.

31
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.990
And then at about 11 o'clock Pacific,

32
00:01:50.991 --> 00:01:55.190
suddenly all the States that seemingly were going to Trump, uh,

33
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.610
suddenly stopped counting. I didn't know that stopping counting was a thing.

34
00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:01.370
I didn't know. You can't count late into the night,

35
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.340
but suddenly everybody stopped counting. And then in the last, you know,

36
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.660
48 hours or so,

37
00:02:05.661 --> 00:02:09.470
we're seeing sort of recounts and they're checking ballots and in

38
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.760
Pennsylvania,

39
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.540
apparently your ballot doesn't even have to be postmarked by the date of the

40
00:02:14.541 --> 00:02:16.910
election. So it could have come in after the election.

41
00:02:16.911 --> 00:02:20.030
That seems a little weird. There's all these stranger regularities.

42
00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:24.980
And one of the strengths and weaknesses of America is that we have

43
00:02:24.981 --> 00:02:27.680
States that can all kind of do things their own way.

44
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.250
And they've done things their own way for decades and decades and decades,

45
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:33.590
about 200 plus years of that.

46
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.660
And there are strengths in that we have a diverse country where you can choose

47
00:02:38.661 --> 00:02:39.231
where to live in.

48
00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:42.290
That might be hopefully a little more in line with the way you think and want to

49
00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:42.501
live.

50
00:02:42.501 --> 00:02:45.830
And you can be around people that you like strange that I'm here in Los Angeles,

51
00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:49.400
but nobody's perfect. Or, uh, the counter to that of course,

52
00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:53.000
is that you'd have one giant sort of machine on top of you.

53
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:54.740
And then it would make a decision.

54
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:57.440
Meaning the federal layer would make some sort of decision, the King,

55
00:02:57.441 --> 00:03:01.450
the president, the prime minister, and then everyone would have to obey that.

56
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.010
I don't view that as good. Now the weakness part of that is all of these States,

57
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:07.150
and we're seeing this right now.

58
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:10.210
They have different rules when it comes to how they count the ballots,

59
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:11.380
when they count the ballots,

60
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:14.530
what they're going to do in many of the States that we're having these odd

61
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:18.250
recount things and they are democratic governors and democratic attorney

62
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:20.710
generals. That's just a fact that doesn't mean they're corrupt.

63
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:23.040
That doesn't mean they're evil, but it is just a fact.

64
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.020
And as I've been talking about this,

65
00:03:25.021 --> 00:03:28.830
a attorney general of Pennsylvania actually said days before the election,

66
00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:30.270
that Biden was going to win the election.

67
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.750
And now Pennsylvania obviously is one of the ones where Trump went from up

68
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.870
700,000 to now I think he's down a couple of votes, but again,

69
00:03:36.871 --> 00:03:39.720
I don't want to get lost in the numbers because that will just make everybody

70
00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:40.441
crazy. And by the way,

71
00:03:40.441 --> 00:03:44.280
you can really feel the craziness going all over the place. Um,

72
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.390
before though I get into some of my predictions and I want to kind of lay out

73
00:03:48.391 --> 00:03:52.350
what will happen. I think if, if Trump wins, what will happen if Biden wins,

74
00:03:52.351 --> 00:03:53.184
what will happen if this,

75
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.040
it really gets strung out for a while and everything else? Um,

76
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.340
I do want to mention one thing about being here in Los Angeles during this.

77
00:03:59.341 --> 00:04:04.110
Now I know a ton of people here in Los Angeles that secretly voted for

78
00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:06.960
Trump. And as I've been saying for weeks, I didn't know anyone.

79
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.100
That was a Trump person last time that voted for Biden this time. And I hear it.

80
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.940
So many versions of that story from you guys,

81
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.860
literally across the country.

82
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.330
And yet here we are in these numbers that that we're supposed to believe,

83
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.600
but okay, that, that's just fine. Uh, one of the interesting things though,

84
00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:27.600
is that I went to my local supermarket. Yes.

85
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.000
And in the supermarket for the last, since lockdown, you know, it's been,

86
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.190
and it depressing in there and they only let a certain amount of people in and

87
00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:38.190
you got to wear your mask. And there's someone outside that looks depressed.

88
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.580
And one day I didn't have a mask. And I say, I forgot my mask at home.

89
00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:44.550
And I was like, Oh, can I just have a mask? I'm just, I'm literally,

90
00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:47.100
I'm like picking up. I was picking up coffee. I think, you know,

91
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.970
can I just get a mask from you guys? And the manager came out and he was like,

92
00:04:50.971 --> 00:04:54.030
if I give you a mask, I have to give everybody a mask,

93
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.520
which is the same thing as, remember when you were in third grade.

94
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.220
And they're like, if you bring cupcakes for your birthday,

95
00:04:59.221 --> 00:05:00.450
you got to bring them for everybody.

96
00:05:00.451 --> 00:05:05.220
You can't just bring them for the people you like anyway, yada, yada, yada,

97
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.570
the place has been kind of depressed.

98
00:05:06.571 --> 00:05:09.840
They've had their outdoor seating pretty much all closed throughout this.

99
00:05:09.841 --> 00:05:12.780
There's been like two or three tables. It's been kind of quiet in there.

100
00:05:12.781 --> 00:05:15.180
I'm not even sure if they've been playing music. Anyway,

101
00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:19.890
I go yesterday and music sick is blasting all the employees. You could just see,

102
00:05:19.891 --> 00:05:24.000
like everyone's happy. The outdoor section suddenly magically opened again.

103
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.420
Like there's just some weird stuff. Now they're all on the assumption.

104
00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:29.070
Obviously that, that Biden is good.

105
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.810
But if your state of being your you're very happiness,

106
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.490
your existential like worldview has been so caught up in this that you chose to

107
00:05:38.491 --> 00:05:41.640
be depressed for however long. And now magically,

108
00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:44.580
even though we don't even have a decision yet, you're, you're up and about,

109
00:05:44.581 --> 00:05:47.640
and you're happy and you're singing and everything else, man, that is,

110
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:48.990
that is not a way to live.

111
00:05:48.991 --> 00:05:52.800
And that's why I always say you have to have a wider philosophical or religious

112
00:05:52.801 --> 00:05:56.310
view of the world. The thing that is eternally true,

113
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.120
otherwise know your guy gets in your depressed.

114
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:03.080
The other guy gets in your happy and you'll basically end up bipolar. Okay.

115
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.280
So now let's, let's talk a little bit about where we're at and what's going on.

116
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:09.400
So right now it's still,

117
00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.850
it's basically just a complete cluster of incentive.

118
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.550
That's kind of where we're at. We got about six,

119
00:06:15.551 --> 00:06:19.050
seven States that still haven't been decided most of them Trump was leading it.

120
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.150
Now it's either getting closer or Biden has taken the lead.

121
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.930
Arizona is the reverse of that, where, uh, they had called it for Biden.

122
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.690
Now it's looking towards Trump, but it doesn't, none of that stuff matters.

123
00:06:28.691 --> 00:06:29.410
Let's just,

124
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.860
let's just put that aside because I don't think all these States are going to

125
00:06:32.861 --> 00:06:34.060
make some decisions today.

126
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.200
There's a feeling in the mainstream media and from the Twitterati that it's

127
00:06:38.201 --> 00:06:41.020
like, it could happen at any moment. They're just going to announce Biden.

128
00:06:41.021 --> 00:06:43.960
And it wouldn't, I wouldn't put it past these people to just announce by it.

129
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.500
And, and then after go from there and,

130
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:49.300
and the Biden campaign released a statement today saying something like, if,

131
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.660
if Trump doesn't leave the white house in 70 days, you know,

132
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.720
will the law enforcement will escort him out or something.

133
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.750
So that type of tweets aloud on there, but you know, not the other tweets. Okay.

134
00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:03.250
Okay, fine. Um, so let's, let's do it this way. So if Biden wins, let's do,

135
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.760
let's do Biden winning first and kind of, kind of where we're at. Oh,

136
00:07:06.761 --> 00:07:08.920
by the way. Uh,

137
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:13.180
I do want to mention that this morning on the Rubin record community, I posted,

138
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.070
you know, sort of how I can help.

139
00:07:15.071 --> 00:07:18.460
What do you guys think I can do in the midst of all this? Like at a micro level,

140
00:07:18.461 --> 00:07:23.160
meaning personally at, at a macro level, meaning sort of societaly like, what,

141
00:07:23.161 --> 00:07:25.960
what can we all do? Not just me, but what can we all do individually?

142
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.660
And we got hundreds of responses and really interesting stuff,

143
00:07:28.661 --> 00:07:32.080
and I'm trying to respond to as many people as possible in there. So again,

144
00:07:32.081 --> 00:07:34.720
if you do want direct communication with me, um,

145
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.620
especially because it's very obvious that the Twitter bands and the suppression

146
00:07:38.621 --> 00:07:40.390
and all that stuff like it's coming, man,

147
00:07:40.391 --> 00:07:43.540
it's coming and that will lead me into the Biden stuff. And just a sec. Uh,

148
00:07:43.541 --> 00:07:47.560
so please do join us@rubinreport.com because you it's direct communication with

149
00:07:47.561 --> 00:07:51.130
me and it's sane and there's no trolls and there's no box and it's all good.

150
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.070
Okay. So look, if Biden wins first,

151
00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:59.140
I think what we'll get out of the media class and out of the

152
00:07:59.141 --> 00:08:04.090
establishment class is basically OD you see the four evil

153
00:08:04.091 --> 00:08:07.480
years before cancer is vile,

154
00:08:07.481 --> 00:08:11.320
disgusting years where we're now purged,

155
00:08:11.321 --> 00:08:12.490
we've now purged them.

156
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.510
And now we can return to some level of norm is normalcy.

157
00:08:16.511 --> 00:08:21.400
Now the good guys will be in charge again. Now we will be America again,

158
00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:25.390
and we'll have, we'll have removed that cancer and all of that.

159
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.820
And I think you'll, you'll really see that yeah. Messaging.

160
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.870
And then I think what you'll also see is what I've been warning about for the

161
00:08:31.871 --> 00:08:35.260
last couple of weeks where we've seen these tweets from people like Robert

162
00:08:35.261 --> 00:08:39.670
Reich, who was in the, uh, Robert Rice Reich, I suppose at some level, uh,

163
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.700
who was in the Clinton administration, you know,

164
00:08:42.701 --> 00:08:45.010
talking about these truth and reconciliation committees,

165
00:08:45.011 --> 00:08:46.270
and we're going to need lists of people.

166
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:51.070
Like I don't put it past any of the establishment people to just really start

167
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:56.100
coming up with lists and names and try to just destroy people and destroy anyone

168
00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:57.750
associated with Trump and everything else,

169
00:08:57.751 --> 00:09:01.730
which in many ways would be see the most anti-American thing you could do.

170
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.630
And what I'm saying is if Trump actually stepped down, stepped away,

171
00:09:05.631 --> 00:09:08.750
said I lost this thing by it and comes in and then you still are going after

172
00:09:08.751 --> 00:09:09.021
them.

173
00:09:09.021 --> 00:09:13.040
You're going after all the people remember after for all the cries of lock her

174
00:09:13.041 --> 00:09:16.100
up and everything else, Trump never did it. You never did it.

175
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:21.170
And we have to allow for government to have their run and then

176
00:09:21.171 --> 00:09:24.200
step away. And we can't be just chasing everybody. And by the way,

177
00:09:24.201 --> 00:09:28.970
once you break that seal and you start going after the people before you, uh,

178
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:29.780
well then of course,

179
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:33.080
what you've welcomed is that someone will come for you as well. Um, all right.

180
00:09:33.081 --> 00:09:35.300
But if Biden wins, I think first we're going to,

181
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.620
that will be the main messaging.

182
00:09:36.621 --> 00:09:40.400
America is somehow back the world likes us again.

183
00:09:40.401 --> 00:09:42.140
We like ourselves again.

184
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.950
And then I think what you also see is that coronavirus will slightly start

185
00:09:45.951 --> 00:09:48.800
disappearing. Now that I think you can argue this one either way,

186
00:09:48.801 --> 00:09:49.730
because on one hand,

187
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.390
Biden was really ramping up the fear around it and talking about, you know,

188
00:09:53.391 --> 00:09:55.220
a national lockdown and everything else.

189
00:09:55.221 --> 00:10:00.020
But my personal suspicion about Corona is that once the system

190
00:10:00.021 --> 00:10:03.290
gets what it wants, if it gets what it wants in a Biden win,

191
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.710
I think suddenly we're going to start seeing that things start opening up again,

192
00:10:06.711 --> 00:10:08.930
and that States will start opening up again and everything else.

193
00:10:08.931 --> 00:10:12.440
And I don't think it was a grand conspiracy to say that the lockdown,

194
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:13.670
especially in the blue States,

195
00:10:13.671 --> 00:10:16.490
had something to do with trying to take out Trump as much as possible.

196
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.380
So I think you could argue it either way. On one hand,

197
00:10:18.381 --> 00:10:21.470
they've really ramped up the fear and people seem to like the lockdowns,

198
00:10:21.471 --> 00:10:23.450
they like being controlled. Then on the other hand, it's like, Oh,

199
00:10:23.451 --> 00:10:26.810
but they accomplished their goal. We got by it. And so now let's let's return.

200
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.920
Um,

201
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.250
I think one of the other things that I'm really worried about if Biden wins is

202
00:10:31.251 --> 00:10:33.770
that big tech will now have nothing to fear.

203
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.260
So you can even see with this election and, you know,

204
00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:40.220
last week they had those silly, uh, Senate hearings with big tech.

205
00:10:40.221 --> 00:10:42.530
And it was like, all right, it's just theater. I like it, Ted Cruz,

206
00:10:42.531 --> 00:10:45.110
but it's just theater because you're not going to do anything before the

207
00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:46.820
election. And then what happened? Well,

208
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.640
we're seeing tweets taken down left and right. I woke up this morning.

209
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:54.200
I had like six emails from Twitter about warnings, about my tweets, um,

210
00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:55.730
and that people were reporting them.

211
00:10:55.730 --> 00:11:00.290
You only get the report emailed to you if like a high level person reports it

212
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.230
because otherwise every single one of my tweets is reported by a bunch of

213
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.520
genderless, anime, avatar, losers. Um, so like they're,

214
00:11:07.521 --> 00:11:10.460
they're clearly going to make the move, right? Like, and this is what, you know,

215
00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:13.370
when I make all my star Wars references, one of the things I kept saying was,

216
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.110
well, if, if Biden gets in,

217
00:11:15.111 --> 00:11:18.800
if the machine starts taking over again and we've had this battle two-sided

218
00:11:18.801 --> 00:11:23.090
battle, but now the machine takes over Biden, big tech,

219
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.730
the Democrats protect, well, why wouldn't you do it? Shut down.

220
00:11:25.731 --> 00:11:28.160
Half of the people you shut down the droid army. That's,

221
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:31.010
that's the analogy that I've been using here. And in essence,

222
00:11:31.011 --> 00:11:35.630
I think that big tech at that point would just begin the purge. Like why,

223
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.850
why wouldn't they, why would you allow for all of these,

224
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.730
these bad people who mainstream will call, uh,

225
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.000
Hitler and racist and accomplices and all of these things.

226
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:48.140
So I think big tech will be emboldened to do bad right stuff. Um,

227
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:49.410
but there will be there,

228
00:11:49.411 --> 00:11:52.430
there are reasons that maybe things could be somewhat okay,

229
00:11:52.431 --> 00:11:56.200
which is the Republicans actually did pretty decently down kick ticket,

230
00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.070
assuming they keep the Senate. Well then, you know, whatever this machine is,

231
00:12:00.071 --> 00:12:04.210
I don't think Biden's in charge of it. The Biden, Harris, Clinton, Obama, blah,

232
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.070
whatever this thing is, it's going to have, you know, some bulwark against it,

233
00:12:09.071 --> 00:12:11.440
which is a Republican Senate. But, you know, I don't know.

234
00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:14.680
Can the Republicans actually stand up to anything without Trump or are they just

235
00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:18.250
like a bunch of in-between losers? I don't know. And again,

236
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.220
this is why I'd never considered myself a Republican in all of this, right?

237
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:24.340
Like I absolutely supported Trump, especially in the last couple of weeks.

238
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:28.300
Cause I thought he was the best vehicle to just keep breaking this thing so we

239
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.460
could try to rebuild something good. Um,

240
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:34.960
but I never have once said that I'm a Republican because these guys are pretty

241
00:12:34.961 --> 00:12:37.330
unimpressive, uh, as a, as a group of people,

242
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.810
do they have the better ideas in my view than the Democrats at this point? Well,

243
00:12:40.811 --> 00:12:44.380
of course they do, but that doesn't mean they do anything really. Um,

244
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.800
so I think we'll have an emboldened, big tech we'll have, you know,

245
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:51.490
hopefully some level of Republican resistance. And,

246
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:56.440
and then I think what that then leads to is some interesting things. Uh,

247
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.090
you know what, I'm going to move, uh, Michael,

248
00:12:58.091 --> 00:13:01.630
I'm going to move our third story up to, to now actually, because, uh,

249
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.990
there were some demographic things and then I'll get to what happens, uh,

250
00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:06.430
if Trump wins in just a sec,

251
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.790
but there were some demographic things that were super interesting in the midst

252
00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:14.230
of all this. So the LGBTQ vote,

253
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.660
it's a lot of letters I could have thrown an I in there.

254
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.000
It's unclear to me how the queue is different than the other letters,

255
00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:23.200
but that LGBT Q vote in 2016 for Trump,

256
00:13:23.201 --> 00:13:27.580
it was 13% and it more than doubled to 28%.

257
00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:30.550
So Trump did pretty well with the gays. You know,

258
00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:35.290
this guy that they said hated the gaze. Uh, even though when I met him that day,

259
00:13:35.291 --> 00:13:39.700
he was thrilled, but we were there and said he couldn't care less. Um,

260
00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.550
so he, more than doubled with the gays,

261
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:47.140
black men went from 14% to 20%.

262
00:13:47.141 --> 00:13:48.700
That's pretty significant, right?

263
00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:51.340
And black women actually doubled from four to eight.

264
00:13:51.341 --> 00:13:54.760
So of course the 20% of the 8%, it's not that those are huge numbers,

265
00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:59.140
but it does show you that the traditional, Oh,

266
00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:02.170
you cannot vote for a Republican if you're this,

267
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.190
but that thing may be broke breaking right now. And,

268
00:14:05.191 --> 00:14:07.540
and no matter what happens to Trump after this,

269
00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:10.600
I think you'd have to credit him for that. Right. Well,

270
00:14:10.601 --> 00:14:11.890
you don't have to do anything right.

271
00:14:11.891 --> 00:14:13.900
And they'll always figure out a way around it. But like,

272
00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:17.830
I think that that might be his greatest legacy. Um,

273
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.800
especially if come 20, 22, if we have, you know,

274
00:14:20.801 --> 00:14:24.610
two years of democratic rule and they invite and brings back critical race

275
00:14:24.611 --> 00:14:28.690
theory and they bring back title nine and the riots continue because the

276
00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:32.530
anarchists and the riot riot people, whatever they are, they don't,

277
00:14:32.531 --> 00:14:34.270
they don't like bite and they don't like the Democrats,

278
00:14:34.271 --> 00:14:38.350
but he'll just do nothing about it. Um, and the States will do nothing about it.

279
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:42.790
Um, so I think there are promising signs in that regard, as I said before,

280
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.510
even the Muslim vote was very high for Trump considering, uh, you know,

281
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:51.410
relative to years past. So there's, there's good signs here. Okay.

282
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.220
So that's, that's if Biden wins, if Biden wins, I think basically the forces,

283
00:14:55.221 --> 00:14:59.210
at least that, that I have been fighting against. I think they get emboldened,

284
00:14:59.211 --> 00:15:03.260
but I think there are some ways that they don't go completely bananas and

285
00:15:03.261 --> 00:15:05.870
perhaps, perhaps,

286
00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:08.270
and I would love for this to happen.

287
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:13.370
Perhaps those last sliver of good liberals actually feel kind of

288
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:17.720
emboldened with Biden. And then they actually do push back on the woke nonsense.

289
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.150
I don't see that there's any evidence that that can happen.

290
00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:21.830
And the woke ism just destroys everything.

291
00:15:21.831 --> 00:15:25.190
So will Harvard suddenly become a little better now,

292
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.370
will the New York times suddenly become a little bit better?

293
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.550
Will any of these people who run around calling everybody racist become a little

294
00:15:31.551 --> 00:15:32.900
bit better? I don't think so,

295
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.930
but I suppose there is a chance and I'm trying to give you guys a little silver

296
00:15:35.931 --> 00:15:40.640
lining today. Um, I, Oh, you know what? I want to pull up this tweet by,

297
00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.013
uh, before we get to Trump,

298
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.260
I want to pull up this tweet by Megan Kelly and I will be interviewing Megan

299
00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.560
Kelly later today, just to sort of break down the media,

300
00:15:48.561 --> 00:15:50.720
take on this whole thing, because as I always tell you guys,

301
00:15:50.721 --> 00:15:55.610
I think the media take on it and the level at which we get information is

302
00:15:55.611 --> 00:15:59.600
sort of more important at some level than the level of what actually is

303
00:15:59.601 --> 00:16:02.420
happening. It's only happening if we can actually, actually,

304
00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:05.600
if we can only actually get the information. Um, so Megan,

305
00:16:05.601 --> 00:16:08.240
let's throw this tweet up. She had an interesting tweet. Uh, she said,

306
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.620
Pelosi says Biden has a huge mandate, really Dems,

307
00:16:12.621 --> 00:16:16.520
losing seats when supposed to gain them in her chamber. Uh,

308
00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.300
DN gain control of Senate saw DT.

309
00:16:20.301 --> 00:16:23.870
Donald Trump win more votes than ever with minority groups and did not see the

310
00:16:23.871 --> 00:16:28.220
promise. Blue wave truth will prevail in January when gridlock settles in.

311
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.970
So the reason I thought that was interesting was because Pelosi's already saying

312
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:35.840
this is a huge mandate, a huge mandate. And it's like, well,

313
00:16:35.841 --> 00:16:39.830
the facts are that it's not really a huge mandate, no matter what happens,

314
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.940
no matter what happens, it's not a huge mandate. Um,

315
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.520
but let's also admit, right. Nancy,

316
00:16:46.521 --> 00:16:50.180
could you admit that you guys never gave Trump a mandate for even one day,

317
00:16:50.181 --> 00:16:54.470
right? You ran with Russia, collusion hoax the entire time, which it's so funny,

318
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:57.860
the same people who ran with a Russian collusion hoax that led to a fake

319
00:16:57.861 --> 00:17:02.120
impeachment, a fo impeachment. They're the ones that saying right now. No, no,

320
00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:05.030
no, no, no. There could be nothing wrong with our election system right now.

321
00:17:05.031 --> 00:17:08.120
The Russian somehow hacked it last time. And Trump had something to do with it.

322
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:08.661
Right?

323
00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:11.750
And we're going to run on that for years and undermine all of the systems,

324
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.900
but right now it's going our way. So the system is perfect.

325
00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:18.200
The system is perfect. I'm seeing a ton of hypocrisy on that one,

326
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:21.170
the same people, the system's evil, it's corrupt. It's broken it.

327
00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:25.190
It's Russian influence now because they're getting the results they want dude,

328
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:29.630
best system ever best system ever. It's just incredible. Amazing,

329
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:33.740
absolutely staggering. Okay. So I thought that was interesting. And as I said,

330
00:17:33.741 --> 00:17:36.920
I'll be interviewing Megan later today. We'll have some clips up tomorrow. Uh,

331
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.350
the full will be on Sunday and as always,

332
00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:43.370
it'll be early on the blaze and on Rubin report.com. Um, okay,

333
00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:47.030
so now let's talk about if Trump wins now, first off we have to lay out,

334
00:17:47.031 --> 00:17:47.631
I suppose,

335
00:17:47.631 --> 00:17:51.420
a scenario that Trump can win because the media is itching to call this thing

336
00:17:51.421 --> 00:17:51.901
right now.

337
00:17:51.901 --> 00:17:54.600
And the States are trying to do everything they can to make it happen.

338
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:58.770
So Trump winning. So if Biden wins, whatever that means,

339
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.640
meaning that the state certified the media runs with it,

340
00:18:02.641 --> 00:18:05.520
that probably I suppose, could happen in the next couple of days.

341
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.300
It seems like that could happen in the next couple of days for Trump to win.

342
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:12.000
I don't see how that could happen in the next couple of days because he doesn't

343
00:18:12.001 --> 00:18:15.960
look like these recounts are going to help him. Maybe the Arizona one does now.

344
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:20.130
There's probably going to be a recount altogether in Wisconsin.

345
00:18:20.131 --> 00:18:21.660
So that delays things a little bit,

346
00:18:21.661 --> 00:18:23.250
depending on what happens with the other States,

347
00:18:23.251 --> 00:18:26.910
if Biden's not able to get to the magic number, um,

348
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.150
but a Trump win realistically has to go through the courts.

349
00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:34.860
What that means is that there'll be enough contested elections at the state

350
00:18:34.861 --> 00:18:37.320
level that the courts will have to fight this out.

351
00:18:37.321 --> 00:18:41.730
So this would so think of this basically as what happened in 2000 with George W.

352
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.320
Bush and with Al Gore, uh,

353
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:48.240
except that instead of it only happening at one state level and really at a

354
00:18:48.241 --> 00:18:52.410
local level Broward County, that it would be happening at a multi-state level.

355
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:57.420
Now I suspect that Trump still has a card or two

356
00:18:57.421 --> 00:18:58.254
up his sleeve.

357
00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:03.420
I suspect that Trump did think that this could very possibly happen. Uh,

358
00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:05.910
there's a video of attorney general bill BARR from,

359
00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:07.770
I think it's about two months ago, uh,

360
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:12.450
being interviewed by Wolf Blitzer saying how he felt that the Mount of massive

361
00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:16.620
fraud that could happen with mail-in ballots is off the charts and that they

362
00:19:16.621 --> 00:19:20.790
have to look into it and all that. So the idea that Trump didn't think, Oh man,

363
00:19:20.791 --> 00:19:24.540
could the system really come crashing down on me and could they just sort of

364
00:19:24.541 --> 00:19:27.570
stop an election and then cause chaos for a couple days. And it was like,

365
00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:30.780
and again, whether you think all of that is true or not, um,

366
00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:35.160
the beauty of the system of the courts is now the courts then can actually

367
00:19:35.161 --> 00:19:39.330
ascertain the information, right? Like Trump doesn't own the courts. Um,

368
00:19:39.331 --> 00:19:43.710
so if you, if you hate Trump, then still getting things to go to the courts.

369
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:45.600
Well, I guess you don't like the courts at this point either,

370
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:48.330
and he's appointed some of the core people and that's why everything's just such

371
00:19:48.331 --> 00:19:52.470
a mess anyway. But the path for Trump, I think only goes through the courts.

372
00:19:52.471 --> 00:19:55.710
Like I don't see a way that Pennsylvania is going to come around and be like

373
00:19:55.711 --> 00:19:58.590
Trump won. Even if they, even if he actually did, like,

374
00:19:58.591 --> 00:20:00.450
I just don't sort of see that happening now,

375
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.090
Georgia is finding all of these votes in Georgia,

376
00:20:03.091 --> 00:20:06.090
which was Trump is now Biden and it's days later,

377
00:20:06.091 --> 00:20:10.320
like it's just happening everywhere in front of our eyes. Okay. I think,

378
00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.180
I think Trump, if he fights it in court, well,

379
00:20:12.181 --> 00:20:15.060
then we probably ended up in like two months of this craziness and,

380
00:20:15.061 --> 00:20:19.980
and that that's not a reason to stop fighting obviously. Um,

381
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:24.690
but I think it's dangerous for just the health of the nation overall.

382
00:20:24.691 --> 00:20:25.291
You know what I mean?

383
00:20:25.291 --> 00:20:29.070
Like just the endless fighting and you guys know everything being equal.

384
00:20:29.071 --> 00:20:30.420
I want Trump to win here. Right?

385
00:20:30.421 --> 00:20:35.370
Like I think that would be the best scenario to keep America free

386
00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.720
democratic capitalist nation. I still believe that. Okay. Um,

387
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:43.410
for whatever his flaws might be and some of his over the top rhetoric of the

388
00:20:43.411 --> 00:20:46.260
last couple of days, like, you know, when Trump goes out there and says, well,

389
00:20:46.261 --> 00:20:51.160
I absolutely one it's like, well, not really. That's not really what happened.

390
00:20:51.161 --> 00:20:52.330
And he that's what Trump does. Right.

391
00:20:52.331 --> 00:20:55.330
He goes over the top and then kind of reel it back in. Um,

392
00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.360
but unfortunately we don't have a media that can deal with this stuff, honestly.

393
00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:01.990
So what I would sort of fear here is that we end up in like just two more months

394
00:21:01.991 --> 00:21:03.120
of this craziness and I,

395
00:21:03.121 --> 00:21:07.420
and I think there's PR I think there's probably so many mental health issues

396
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:09.370
that we're not dealing with properly. I mean,

397
00:21:09.371 --> 00:21:12.220
I think that's very clear if you look at what the average blue check person is

398
00:21:12.221 --> 00:21:16.570
doing on Twitter, like there's a certain point where, well, we're all,

399
00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.360
we'll all kind of snap. We'll all kind of snap.

400
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:23.230
I have no doubt that you guys are having some problems in your family related to

401
00:21:23.231 --> 00:21:26.170
politics and with friends related to politics.

402
00:21:26.171 --> 00:21:29.800
And I've got a couple of those situations for as public as I am about all of

403
00:21:29.801 --> 00:21:33.310
this at some level you would think, Oh, people know no, what I think.

404
00:21:33.311 --> 00:21:36.700
And it's like, it is what it is. And then still in the last couple of days,

405
00:21:36.701 --> 00:21:40.030
people have started coming out of the woodwork and being all angry at me.

406
00:21:40.031 --> 00:21:42.400
And I do always find that the anger only goes one way.

407
00:21:42.401 --> 00:21:46.300
Like I'm not angry at my friends that voted for Biden or that didn't support

408
00:21:46.301 --> 00:21:49.270
Trump or whatever. Like I think maybe they were mistaken.

409
00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:51.550
I'm not even sitting here telling you I'm totally right about everything,

410
00:21:51.551 --> 00:21:55.600
but like the anger and the I'm going to remove you from my family.

411
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.390
I'm not going to be your friend anymore. I'm going to get you out of my life.

412
00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:03.310
That seems to be a, a one-way anger. And that,

413
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.620
I think there's philosophical reasons for that, that I,

414
00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:07.060
that I actually wrote about in my book. I mean,

415
00:22:07.061 --> 00:22:10.000
I think if you just think this is everything, if you just look,

416
00:22:10.001 --> 00:22:13.960
wake up in the world every day and you just look around and just think current

417
00:22:13.961 --> 00:22:17.140
events are the answer to everything and that's what you do. Oh, that happened.

418
00:22:17.141 --> 00:22:18.730
This happened, that happened. This happened, this happened.

419
00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:22.090
And you never look up, right? You never think about what the big picture is,

420
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.370
what life really is all about. Well then you can,

421
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.620
you'll be angry at everyone all the time.

422
00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.250
So Trump's path I think is through the courts. It would be a messy,

423
00:22:30.251 --> 00:22:32.080
messy slog to get there.

424
00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:36.970
But I will say this Trump is a fighter in a way that normal

425
00:22:36.971 --> 00:22:40.330
Republicans aren't right. Like you can even see it right now. These,

426
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:45.190
these Lincoln project dingbats who pumped like a hundred million bucks into one

427
00:22:45.191 --> 00:22:48.490
of the senatorial races. And then they lost, I think it was to Joni Ernst.

428
00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.270
It's like, well, you guys, they're all feeling emboldened right now.

429
00:22:52.271 --> 00:22:53.470
Like they're feeling emboldened. They're like,

430
00:22:53.471 --> 00:22:55.690
we're going to double down on everything and keep doing everything.

431
00:22:55.691 --> 00:22:58.030
And it's like, you guys aren't even Republicans, like,

432
00:22:58.031 --> 00:22:59.350
what are you fighting for?

433
00:22:59.351 --> 00:23:02.830
How are you conservative or Republican if you're going to put in people,

434
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.620
if you will fight against your only fighters. Right?

435
00:23:05.621 --> 00:23:09.250
And then you're going to actually put in people who are against everything that

436
00:23:09.251 --> 00:23:10.900
you purport to believe in. Like you're not,

437
00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.810
you're not Republicans or conservative. You're not even principled. You're just,

438
00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.510
you're just people that want to be liked, I guess.

439
00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:19.960
And that is a thing that is a thing in the world, um,

440
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:23.410
that people just sort of throw in the towel and just say, okay, I just want to,

441
00:23:23.411 --> 00:23:27.580
I just want to be liked like that. That is a thing. So anyway, Trump's,

442
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:32.050
Trump's slog to get there is, is a long court battle. I think the Biden thing,

443
00:23:32.051 --> 00:23:35.320
they're probably going to try to call this thing for Biden in the next couple of

444
00:23:35.321 --> 00:23:35.501
days,

445
00:23:35.501 --> 00:23:38.940
and then Trump will contest and then we'll kind of see where we're at and we'll,

446
00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:42.490
and hopefully the violence won't be too crazy. You know, Portland,

447
00:23:42.491 --> 00:23:45.380
they've gone into some residential neighborhoods and they're yelling at people

448
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:48.200
and, and burning down. And you know,

449
00:23:48.201 --> 00:23:50.180
we're seeing this in New York city and some other places,

450
00:23:50.181 --> 00:23:53.960
hopefully some calmer heads prevail. Uh, but I don't know.

451
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:58.190
I genuinely don't know. I think, I think, let me throw in one other thing here,

452
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:01.850
I've laid out the map provide,

453
00:24:01.851 --> 00:24:04.550
and it probably happens in the next couple of days, the media runs with it.

454
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:08.030
Big tech gets prepared to like get rid of all of the opposition,

455
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.300
the real resistance, actually like the people who are against the system,

456
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:15.530
there'll be the ones taken out. Right. And that that's a, that is a problem. Um,

457
00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.270
and I've laid out the BA the Trump one,

458
00:24:17.271 --> 00:24:20.930
which is that we go through the courts and we just kind of see where we're at.

459
00:24:20.931 --> 00:24:23.840
And then, and then even after the courts, if they actually said Trump wins,

460
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:28.490
can you imagine the insanity that, that the left would unleash? I mean,

461
00:24:28.491 --> 00:24:31.460
I can't even possibly imagine. You can see how,

462
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:35.900
how vindictive and angry they are right now when they think they've won. Like,

463
00:24:35.901 --> 00:24:38.660
imagine if at the end of this, they actually lose. Then,

464
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:42.680
then we got a bigger problem. So there's all of that.

465
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:47.810
And then there's also, well, okay. If Trump just says, you know what,

466
00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.020
maybe he doesn't take it all the way. Maybe suddenly it's like, you know what?

467
00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.860
We did everything we could there's, there's nothing left. We,

468
00:24:53.861 --> 00:24:57.810
we looked at all the legal, uh, repercussions. We looked at all the options.

469
00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:00.860
There's, there's absolutely nothing left and he steps away. Well,

470
00:25:00.861 --> 00:25:02.990
then what happens to the Republican party?

471
00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:07.730
Do you just get this sort of neutered Republican thing that kind of wants to be

472
00:25:07.731 --> 00:25:12.260
liked by the media never comes to anything? Or did he model enough on,

473
00:25:12.261 --> 00:25:15.170
on how to fight? So you actually get some good Republicans.

474
00:25:15.171 --> 00:25:18.140
Now that was my hope all along. Remember in the last couple weeks I kept saying,

475
00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:20.480
my hope is, if Trump wins again,

476
00:25:20.481 --> 00:25:23.540
you get that beautiful thing out of the Republicans in 2024,

477
00:25:23.541 --> 00:25:27.770
and you get this really wide swath of people that include Nikki Haley and Dan

478
00:25:27.771 --> 00:25:28.191
Crenshaw,

479
00:25:28.191 --> 00:25:33.050
and maybe Candace Owens and Tim Scott and who the hell knows who the hell knows.

480
00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.310
I think that that's a little more difficult to argue if, if he just steps away.

481
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.270
Anyway, it's the weekend guys. I'm having friends over tonight.

482
00:25:41.271 --> 00:25:42.230
We're going to drink.

483
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:46.250
Maybe we'll smoke a little something because I think we're free for now.

484
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.500
Who the hell knows. I hope you have a great weekend.

485
00:25:48.501 --> 00:25:52.460
Try not to spend too much time online. Although, as I said, Megan,

486
00:25:52.461 --> 00:25:56.660
Kelly eclipse tomorrow and full video on Sunday, but get out there,

487
00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:00.920
find the ones you love, have some fun, do something you like to do,

488
00:26:00.921 --> 00:26:04.790
whatever that is. Walk the dog, play some video games,

489
00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:09.770
do a little yoga, take her, take a jog, whatever it is, get out there.

490
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.710
It's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. I promise you.

491
00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.090
And if it isn't going to be okay,

492
00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:18.110
we may as well think it's going to be okay because the alternative is pretty

493
00:26:18.111 --> 00:26:19.940
freaking depressing. All right. Have a good weekend, everybody.
