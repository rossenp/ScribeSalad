1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.170
<v 0>The Disney company in the early nineties, 20 years earlier,</v>

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.480
we're giving benefits to partners of their gay employees. So once again,

3
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.270
we've got the free market looking out for the individuals because they have to

4
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.740
make a profit. They want to hire the best employees.

5
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:20.550
So they've got to basically put in, you know, uh, you know,

6
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.930
about a peer pressure.

7
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.360
[inaudible].

8
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.410
<v 1>Focused obviously more on,</v>

9
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.470
on Trump because he's the president and policies of the conservatives.

10
00:00:33.471 --> 00:00:37.850
W w what do you make about what's going on with the Democrats right now,

11
00:00:37.851 --> 00:00:40.910
and what seems to be a war between the younger,

12
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.600
progressive lefties versus a little bit, I guess,

13
00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:47.210
of what's left of the old guard. There ain't much left.

14
00:00:47.211 --> 00:00:50.450
And I think it's sort of summed up by it's summed up by Biden.

15
00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:51.860
What do you make about what's going on there?

16
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.791
<v 0>Well,</v>

17
00:00:52.791 --> 00:00:57.170
but the old guard is still strong and the thing that I've been pointing out is

18
00:00:57.171 --> 00:01:01.220
how they muzzled Tulsi. Gabard how they unfairly kept her out of the debates.

19
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.320
And what's such a shame is that the democratic party used to be the party of

20
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.020
peace. They used to be the anti-war party,

21
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.670
and they've got a great antiwar candidate, uh, Tulsa Gabbert, by the way,

22
00:01:13.671 --> 00:01:18.560
let me qualify that and say great on that position. I mean, I realize, yes,

23
00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:22.640
she's socialist on the economic issues and that's why I wouldn't vote for her.

24
00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:26.960
That's why I'm running for president, excuse me, but on the war issues,

25
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.950
she's great. And yet the government is the,

26
00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:34.820
the democratic establishment kept her out of the debates because I wanted to

27
00:01:34.821 --> 00:01:39.020
quiet her down. So yeah, the old guard that there may not be many of them left,

28
00:01:39.021 --> 00:01:41.480
but they sure are powerful. And that's really a shame.

29
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.620
And that brings me by the way, just one other quick point is, uh, you know,

30
00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:49.580
I talk about how the democratic party used to be the anti-war party.

31
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.150
When I first joined the movement and people asked me what a libertarian was,

32
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.360
what I would say is, well, we take the best of both sides. You know,

33
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.200
we take the best parts about the right about the Republicans.

34
00:02:00.201 --> 00:02:04.220
So we believe in economic freedoms and we take the best about the left that were

35
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.580
antiwar, that we believe in individual Liberty.

36
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.890
And now I can't say that anymore because Democrats aren't acting like

37
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.530
Democrats and Republicans aren't acting like Republicans,

38
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.110
and maybe it was coincidence that they even agreed with us.

39
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.370
And young people are shocked when I tell them that as recently as 2012,

40
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.960
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, both were against gay marriage. Meanwhile,

41
00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:29.540
the libertarian party was for individual rights. You know,

42
00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:33.410
they were advocating gay marriage in 1972. I hate to say advocating,

43
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.070
advocating the rights, you know, not, not that everybody should do it,

44
00:02:37.071 --> 00:02:41.540
but advocate, whereas Democrats, that's a whole different,

45
00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:45.860
that sounds far more authoritarian. Yeah. Yeah.

46
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.550
The people at the top of the democratic party,

47
00:02:49.551 --> 00:02:53.240
they're saying gay marriage should be illegal. And if you don't mind,

48
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.940
let me bring in one other free market item here,

49
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.850
the Disney company in the early 20 years earlier,

50
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.990
we're giving benefits to partners of their gay employees.

51
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.160
So once again,

52
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.900
we've got the free market looking out for the individuals because they have to,

53
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.420
to, to make a profit, they want to hire the best employees.

54
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:17.260
So they've got to basically put into, you know, uh, you know,

55
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.610
about a peer pressure. So, and, you know, going back to racists and,

56
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.990
and all those laws, again,

57
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.430
the free market can do such a much better job than the government at anything.

58
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.620
<v 1>What do you make about, uh, what's going on with Biden?</v>

59
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.600
Do you think something's wrong? There.

60
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.300
<v 0>I'm not a clinical psychologist, but even if I were,</v>

61
00:03:39.301 --> 00:03:42.120
I think there's some law that would keep me from diagnosing him,

62
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.980
but my answer is

63
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.950
it doesn't w what concerns me is what he was saying 10, 20 years ago. I mean,

64
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.440
what he was saying 10, 20 years ago,

65
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.330
as a younger man that made absolutely no sense. What worries me is,

66
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.991
you know,

67
00:03:57.991 --> 00:04:01.410
how he thought the crime bill was such a good thing to pass in the nineties.

68
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.560
So people are saying, well, maybe he's not all with it. Now.

69
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.380
I would suggest he wasn't with it 20 or 30 years ago.

70
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.190
<v 1>All right. I got one more for ya. I'm gonna,</v>

71
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.120
I'm going to toss you a softball here and just tell you that. As I, as I think,

72
00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:18.750
you know, I have a lot of disaffected liberals that watch this show.

73
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.830
I have a lot of what I would call sort of new school conservatives and even old

74
00:04:22.831 --> 00:04:27.420
school conservatives. Um, but I would say generally at this point,

75
00:04:27.421 --> 00:04:31.470
my audience leans probably center, right? Joe Jorgensen make your,

76
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.480
make your pitch for why they should vote for you. Uh, on November 4th.

77
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.750
<v 0>I would say, I understand why you voted for Trump to the conservatives.</v>

78
00:04:42.751 --> 00:04:45.870
In 2016, he came in as an outsider.

79
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.410
He said he was going to cut the budget. He was going to cut spending.

80
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.500
He said he was a businessman who knew how to get things done in,

81
00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:55.350
he would bring the troops home, but he didn't do any of that.

82
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.620
And I would say to the Democrats, you know, again,

83
00:04:58.621 --> 00:05:02.610
the democratic party has traditionally been the party of peace. Uh,

84
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.230
they shut down Tulsi Gabard, they shut down Bernie Sanders. Basically,

85
00:05:07.231 --> 00:05:11.910
you've got, uh, a very slick party machine going on that gave you Joe Biden,

86
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.420
even though you don't want him, if you really want an outsider,

87
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.610
then please check me out and go to Joe twenty.com. That's J O twenty.com.

88
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.230
And I think you'll see that we are really, uh, what you believe in.

89
00:05:25.231 --> 00:05:27.360
We are the ones giving you what you want.

90
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.190
And I'm so excited to announce that something like 75% of our volunteers are

91
00:05:32.191 --> 00:05:36.270
from outside the party, because they realize that they're just not that,

92
00:05:36.271 --> 00:05:39.480
that the two old parties just aren't giving them what they want.

93
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.400
<v 1>All right. My thank you for your time.</v>

94
00:05:41.401 --> 00:05:45.120
I'm glad we were finally able to do this and, uh, good luck the rest of the way.

95
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.970
Can I ask you one quick question? Sure.

96
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.480
<v 0>So you voted for Gary Johnson. Have I won your vote?</v>

97
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.790
<v 1>That's good. That's good, Joe, listen,</v>

98
00:05:56.791 --> 00:06:01.760
I am so frustrated by what is happening with the left and the

99
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:06.590
destruction of our institutions, academic media institutions, everything else.

100
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.630
And I, at this point, I see Trump as the bulwark against that,

101
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.710
the ideas that you've laid out here for the little marginal differences we have,

102
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.330
I think are the right ideas. My audience knows that. I say that all the time.

103
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.880
Um, I don't think this time that I can vote for a third party to,

104
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.520
to be totally honest. And I get you hear a lot of that.

105
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:33.530
And I think you can probably hear it in my voice that it's not the way I sorta

106
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.780
want to go in a certain regard,

107
00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:40.520
but I think Trump has done enough on the big things that I care about. Um,

108
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.800
but I'll be happy to discuss this with you privately,

109
00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:44.570
maybe the day before the election. How about that?

110
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.010
<v 0>Can I make one last plea tier of yours,</v>

111
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.890
which is many of you live in a solidly red state? Like I do,

112
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.670
uh, you know, we were one of only six States to carry Bob Dole.

113
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.710
Your state's going to carry Donald Trump. Anyway, uh,

114
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.970
the red States are going to give Donald Trump the electoral college votes.

115
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.990
If you want to send a message to Trump, that you don't like that he's got new,

116
00:07:10.991 --> 00:07:14.950
bigger government vote for me because Trump's going to get the electoral votes.

117
00:07:14.951 --> 00:07:18.790
Anyway, if you live in a solidly blue state like California, Joe,

118
00:07:18.791 --> 00:07:23.350
Biden's gonna get it. If you're not happy with what your candidate is doing,

119
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.340
then vote for me because in the solid red and solid blue States,

120
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.850
it's not going to make much of a difference. So let's send some kind of message.

121
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:32.591
<v 1>You know what, Joe, that,</v>

122
00:07:32.591 --> 00:07:36.670
that is totally in line with what I was saying four years ago.

123
00:07:36.671 --> 00:07:40.420
And that's why I was fighting for J Gary Johnson to get into the debates,

124
00:07:40.421 --> 00:07:44.470
because my thought was okay, if the, if the libertarian isn't going to win,

125
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.770
let's just, you know, if that's just not realistic at the moment,

126
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:52.750
I'm talking four years ago, then at least let's get these ideas out there.

127
00:07:52.751 --> 00:07:54.250
It starts with ideas.

128
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.720
And if that's a policy or if that's an idea that can get you to seed some of

129
00:07:58.721 --> 00:08:02.440
these good ideas out there, ideologically, I'm totally with you.

130
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.490
<v 0>Okay. Well, thanks so much. I hope to be on your show again.</v>

131
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:11.110
<v 1>Yeah, I enjoyed it. And good luck. And we'll talk again. Thanks.</v>

132
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.630
<v 0>Thanks. Thanks so much. Had a great time. If you're.</v>
