00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.290
<v 0>I have a chat. I have a chapter on this in the book, and I talk about how, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.190
th th the most manic of, of these individuals, uh,

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.020
are according to research are incredibly us anti-social and they can't tell if

4
00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:14.100
it's the chicken or the egg,

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.460
is that their own beliefs and ideologies that make them antisocial,

6
00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:21.240
or is it something about them that makes them that way?

7
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.610
And when you look at what's going on in his,

8
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.040
in the streets of Portland and Seattle, there's,

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.780
there is a mental issue going on there. They do not seem stable.

10
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.370
So I think that these are people that have lost contact with their loved ones,

11
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:35.941
their family.

12
00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:39.390
I don't think these are people that come home for Thanksgiving and help with the

13
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:40.224
Turkey.

14
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.500
<v 2>As a guy that just wrote a S you know, a self-help,</v>

15
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.930
it's a self-help mockery in a way, but it's also,

16
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.170
but it is self-help at the same time. What do you think it is about that time?

17
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.411
Like,

18
00:00:57.411 --> 00:01:00.560
what do you think the dividing line is between a type of person who wants to

19
00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:05.180
take care of themselves in their life versus the type of person that wants

20
00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:10.100
to, because we see so much of this everywhere, just take out of it.

21
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.810
<v 0>There are people, well, I have a chat, I have a chapter on this in the book,</v>

22
00:01:14.811 --> 00:01:18.590
and I talk about how th the most manic of,

23
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.220
of these individuals, uh, are according to research are incredibly,

24
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.630
uh anti-social and they can't tell if it's the chicken or the egg,

25
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.990
is that their own beliefs and ideologies that make them antisocial,

26
00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:33.650
or is it something about them that makes them that way?

27
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.020
And when you look at what's going on in his,

28
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.450
in the streets of Portland and Seattle, there is,

29
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.220
there is a mental issue going on there. They do not seem stable.

30
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.780
So I think that these are people that have lost contact with their loved ones,

31
00:01:47.781 --> 00:01:48.351
their family.

32
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:51.800
I don't think these are people that come home for Thanksgiving and help with the

33
00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:52.970
Turkey, right?

34
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.890
I think that their joy in life is to humiliate

35
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.240
and attack. And have you hear their screams in their cries?

36
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.450
I do think that we're living in an age of hysteria,

37
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.980
and I think it's also bleeding into other certain segments that I can't even

38
00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:14.810
talk about certain activists who do not represent the people they

39
00:02:14.811 --> 00:02:16.730
claim to. There's a great, um, Oh,

40
00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:21.530
there's a great clip of this African-American cop in Portland talking

41
00:02:21.531 --> 00:02:25.940
about how black activists came up to him and said, Hey, you know, um, you know,

42
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.020
how do you feel about George Floyd?

43
00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:30.980
As he's talking a white leftist female comes over and goes,

44
00:02:30.981 --> 00:02:34.070
don't talk to him. She's telling a black woman not to talk to him.

45
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.020
And you realize, okay, this is a, this is a mental issue. This is, uh,

46
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.550
so I think that you almost have to pull them out of this cult,

47
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.080
you and I aren't in Colts because th th the measure of a cult is the ability to

48
00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:50.810
admit when you're wrong. Like I admit I'm wrong on like,

49
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.950
at least once or twice a year now once or twice, like we were pretty regularly.

50
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.380
Um, uh, well, it's.

51
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.650
<v 2>Not only do we admit Greg, Natalie, do you admit you're wrong?</v>

52
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.910
Can you tell the good people,

53
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:04.090
what happened this very week on the Greg Gutfeld show with you and cows?

54
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:05.980
You made a major, a major admission.

55
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.890
<v 0>Yes. Uh, emission, nice one or omission, EMIS. And, um,</v>

56
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.430
I might've, I I've noticed this, that,

57
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.130
um, we all have, and even Adams has said this, but he wanted a bit, what, what,

58
00:03:23.131 --> 00:03:27.810
what mistakes that we have these like really embarrassing things that we,

59
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.650
that we won't voice, because we're, for example, in Seinfeld,

60
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.710
it was George SCA. It didn't want to go to a flea market.

61
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.700
Cause he thought there were fleas. I always thought that I thought that too,

62
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.320
they'll do a flea markets in Belmont, California, and my friends want to go,

63
00:03:42.321 --> 00:03:45.300
I go, I'm not going there because I thought so too.

64
00:03:45.301 --> 00:03:50.280
I have two idiotic beliefs in the last month that I've talked about one on the

65
00:03:50.281 --> 00:03:52.830
five. I thought deal was a separate animal.

66
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.340
I didn't know that it was like a baby cow. No idea.

67
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.630
I thought like when you order veal,

68
00:03:57.631 --> 00:04:01.140
it's like ordering lamb or it's just a different animal. So that's a bear thing.

69
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.680
But I didn't know that cows were only female.

70
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.490
I thought that a cow was just like, there was a man, so that's stupid.

71
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.970
But it's like, I, I don't mind confessing that. I know these things.

72
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.620
I I'm an idiot because I know for a fact that everybody,

73
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:20.460
everybody feels that way. I mean,

74
00:04:20.461 --> 00:04:23.190
there are people that think that there might be 52 States, uh,

75
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.880
because they get confused between a deck of cards and the United States.

76
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.150
And also you have those two States that are outside. Sometimes I'm going like,

77
00:04:30.151 --> 00:04:32.820
is it 52 or 50, 52 or 50?

78
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.740
I should check because I get confused. You know, is it 48 plus two it's 48.

79
00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:41.160
Plus it also, there are things like when you think about geography in general,

80
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.700
that you can get stuck totally wrong because, uh,

81
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.780
you kind of skipped over it and somebody could trick you into thinking that

82
00:04:48.781 --> 00:04:51.660
something was part of something when it really wasn't. Um,

83
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.500
there are parts of Europe that I might've thought were parts of other places.

84
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.080
<v 2>But it's all of that is all of that. Really?</v>

85
00:04:58.081 --> 00:05:02.640
Just because everyone seems to pretend that they know everything at all

86
00:05:02.641 --> 00:05:05.400
times, net neutrality was going to kill. Everybody,

87
00:05:05.401 --> 00:05:09.060
sold him on his death was going to start world war three. You know,

88
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.750
there's some, the Russia thing, the Ukraine thing with the Iran, nuclear deal.

89
00:05:12.751 --> 00:05:16.890
People who have no jobs, no people who can't get their lives together,

90
00:05:16.891 --> 00:05:20.850
but they know everything about string theory and economic policy, you know?

91
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.650
<v 0>Yes. I try to do that. You know,</v>

92
00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:26.790
who knows EV I'm convinced you knows everything. According to his fans,

93
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.110
as John Oliver manage usage, his 30 minute on net neutrality,

94
00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:35.640
it'll change your life. It's like, no, thanks. I'd rather be ignorant. I don't,

95
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.240
I don't think I need to know 30 minutes on net neutrality because I know where

96
00:05:39.241 --> 00:05:43.200
it's going to end up in the same place. It always does. And to your point,

97
00:05:43.201 --> 00:05:46.290
it's always the same place. And I think it's helped like, like string theory.

98
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:47.190
This is like,

99
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.960
this is the blessing and curse of podcasts that you can do your curriculum.

100
00:05:51.961 --> 00:05:55.740
I'm going to learn about quantum physics and quantum mechanics or quantum

101
00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:59.750
gravity put quantum in front of everything. And suddenly people like, Ooh,

102
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.920
who is this guy? But I enjoy I quantum leap. Yes.

103
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.790
I love that actor. There was Scott.

104
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.840
<v 2>Cut back. And Oh, the other guy, the other guy.</v>

105
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.770
<v 0>Who played booth, uh, who played Mr. Booth and blue velvet.</v>

106
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.150
<v 2>Who was, he was in green hair. He was in the movie boy with green hair.</v>

107
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.510
He was an air force one. I just watched it this weekend. Uh.

108
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.760
<v 0>Oh God, geez, Louise.</v>

109
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.540
If only somebody here could Google the boy with green hair, that Jew.

110
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.560
Did you see that movie as a kid? Do you ever see that movie as a boy?

111
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.670
He wakes up with gray hair.

112
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.850
<v 2>I don't think I've seen it. Very scary.</v>

113
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.270
<v 0>Amazing. I saw it as a child probably came out in the 1940s, 1950s,</v>

114
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.710
but the guy we're talking about, Stuart stew, Stan,

115
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.040
uh, uh, step, uh, George.

116
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.470
<v 2>We should do it. You know what I'm going to do? Wait, Greg, watch this.</v>

117
00:06:50.471 --> 00:06:52.870
I'm going to do something. I've never done this on my show before,

118
00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:57.430
but my director is remote right now. He's in my ear, Matt.

119
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.690
I want you to Google the actor that we're talking about. He was in quantum leap.

120
00:07:01.691 --> 00:07:04.210
He was not Scott back ULA, but the other guy,

121
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.170
and apparently he had green hair as a child. Can you get me that actor's name?

122
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.510
This is the most cable news I've ever been right now.

123
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.150
<v 0>Yeah. And he was the guy that ran the bordello in the dark. Well,</v>

124
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.410
Dean Stockwell. I hope he's still alive. Do you start well?

125
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.820
Did you, do you ever see blue velvet?

126
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.270
<v 2>Wait, hold on. Let me go back to the control room. Matt is Dean.</v>

127
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.070
Stockwell's still alive. Yes.

128
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.430
<v 0>Stand by Greg. I hope he is</v>

129
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.350
still alive. No. Wow.

130
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.680
<v 2>He's 84 and still alive. At least as of this taping.</v>

131
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:45.870
<v 0>Road trip, we are going on as Dean stop. Did you?</v>

132
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.720
I have to ask you because it's my favorite movie of all time is blue velvet and

133
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.460
these Stockwell's character was the guy that ran the whorehouse that Dennis

134
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:58.750
Hopper came to. And it's one of the greatest scenes in any movie.

135
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.300
Um, anyway, that's mine. Did you wait,

136
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:02.830
you look like you've not seen blue velvet.

137
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.690
<v 2>I actually, I haven't seen it. Believe it or not, but Gutfeld. I got to tell ya.</v>

138
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:08.500
I love ya.

139
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.070
But your movie recommendations over the last couple of months have really been

140
00:08:12.071 --> 00:08:16.420
disastrous. Um, I'm texting you one morning. I'm like,

141
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:18.960
I don't know what we're going to watch tonight. I've watched everything.

142
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.140
You're like, Oh, you got to watch the color of something with Nick cage.

143
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.100
I literally, I got brain damage in the middle of the movie that horrible.

144
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.290
<v 0>Whoa, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.</v>

145
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:34.290
That's the port of call with Nicholas? No, no,

146
00:08:34.291 --> 00:08:39.100
no, not the color. His face. It's, it's a remake. The, uh, the, um, officer the,

147
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.420
um, fire. I can't swear right now because of, you know,

148
00:08:43.421 --> 00:08:45.610
you can square it square. People will like it.

149
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.620
It was a remake of a Harvey Keitel movie, but it really wasn't.

150
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:54.340
And it's called Porter call and it's by the guy who did grizzly man, um,

151
00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:58.290
the director, um, who did grizzly man Werner Herzog did it.

152
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:03.450
And it's called, um, cop officer bad Lieutenant port of call.

153
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.960
And it's got li iguanas in it. How could you not love that movie?

154
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.670
How could you not love that movie? The Nick cage. It's what a Nick cage,

155
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.690
his best films, the cage. Also, if you've ever you didn't like Mandy, did you,

156
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:16.973
Mandy, what are you?

157
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.340
<v 2>Yeah, I tried to watch that because of you two.</v>

158
00:09:19.341 --> 00:09:21.860
I watched it for about a half hour and I couldn't take it anymore.

159
00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:25.970
I was sitting in a pool of my own vomit and I thought I got.

160
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:27.733
<v 0>All right, wait.</v>

161
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.080
<v 2>This is what you call a tangent.</v>

162
00:09:30.081 --> 00:09:33.830
This is the beauty of YouTube that you don't have the luxury as a,

163
00:09:33.831 --> 00:09:37.430
as a cable news host to do these, do these things. Um,

164
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.580
actually I wanted to ask you about something somewhat serious, actually,

165
00:09:40.581 --> 00:09:43.490
because just in the last couple of days, uh, you know,

166
00:09:43.491 --> 00:09:48.200
Tucker did this end of the show monologue about what the New York times is doing

167
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.380
Ram. And they've basically, they've basically threatened to dox him.

168
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.690
They already did one version of this,

169
00:09:53.691 --> 00:09:57.620
and we know that people have shown up at his house before and all that. Uh,

170
00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:02.090
I feel that this is the next level of where this is all going,

171
00:10:02.091 --> 00:10:06.140
that they've said, it's okay to burn down stores, violence. Isn't violence,

172
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.080
words are violence, but violence is, and it's very confusing,

173
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:12.200
but the next level of this will be that it will be,

174
00:10:12.201 --> 00:10:17.150
it will be something to the effect of can Republicans go to public

175
00:10:17.151 --> 00:10:21.110
places and can Republicans have homes that are not doxed?

176
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.570
Or are you worried about that? Like what, what do you make of this thing?

177
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.823
<v 0>Oh, um,</v>

178
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.680
I'm worried in a number of ways that I've actually acted on it. Uh,

179
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:34.070
for the last couple of years, actually I've acted on, uh, on certain things to,

180
00:10:34.071 --> 00:10:37.550
to for safety reasons. And we've talked about that before. Um,

181
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.060
I find it interesting that all the things that you talked about are okay,

182
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:44.300
but they're charging that couple for brandishing,

183
00:10:44.301 --> 00:10:47.420
that weapon when the mob approach broke down the gate and was in front of their

184
00:10:47.421 --> 00:10:51.140
house. So they're actually not only can you be threatened,

185
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.910
not only can your, uh, public and private property be vandalized,

186
00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.860
but you cannot defend yourself.

187
00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:01.190
