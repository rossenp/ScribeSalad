1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.380
<v 0>The United States right now.</v>

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.590
I don't believe I haven't looked at those figures in a while,

3
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.610
but I don't think that the United States is the largest polluter in the world.

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.460
I think that China and India are above us. Now,

5
00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:14.610
here you have four and a half billion people, um,

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.840
who are trying to get rich quick and who are spewing a lot of CO2 into the

7
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:22.650
atmosphere and who are also very competitive with us because they have very low

8
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:27.480
wages. So to tie ourselves to the Paris climate accord,

9
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.840
uh, was the wrong way to go about it. And you know,

10
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:35.130
what else happened was that the United States has decreased its

11
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.140
emissions of CO2 per capita at a faster pace than most places in the

12
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:43.560
world. Why? Because we started, uh,

13
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:48.030
we started getting rid of our coal power plants and we started introducing more

14
00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:52.980
and more natural gas into our electricity production and natural gas

15
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.250
burns, or rather emits much less CO2 than coal.

16
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.640
And so by simply by innovating,

17
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.690
by basically changing the source of fuel from coal to natural gas,

18
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.580
we were able to decrease our CO2 emissions at a faster click than we would have

19
00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:10.770
been obliged to do under Paris.

20
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.380
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.030
<v 2>One of the interesting things about, uh,</v>

22
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.950
this trend I thought was that your answer basically said sort of trust that

23
00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:27.170
human ideas can solve problems.

24
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:31.160
And that in many ways is so counter to what we hear coming out of the left. Now,

25
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:34.370
you know, we hear about the, the green new deal and that,

26
00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:39.140
that this centralized planning thing can somehow magically just

27
00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:43.250
sort of solve all of these problems if we just gave it enough power, but it,

28
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.700
but in many ways, you're what power and money, of course. But in many ways,

29
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.250
what you're saying is you decentralize things.

30
00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:53.930
You let people come up with new ideas and suddenly we will have a thinner can

31
00:01:53.931 --> 00:01:57.320
and less resources will be taken and it'll actually be cheaper and there'll be

32
00:01:57.321 --> 00:01:58.280
more readily available.

33
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.880
<v 0>The answer to climate change is not going to come from central planning and from</v>

34
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:06.530
restrictions for two reasons,

35
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.490
let's divide the world into two halves in one half,

36
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.720
you have rich people like you and I relatively rich, obviously,

37
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.450
um, living in democracies now we are prepared to

38
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.090
pay a little more for the protection of the environment we are.

39
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.090
And we are willing to put up with taxes, which are a little bit higher,

40
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.980
but not much higher. In fact, all the opinion, polls and, and, um,

41
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.880
surveys suggest that people are willing to put up a little more toward, uh,

42
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.530
toward cleaning of the climate.

43
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.780
What they are not prepared to do is to end the first world lifestyles as

44
00:02:41.781 --> 00:02:46.550
they know it on, uh, for the benefit of, uh, of, of,

45
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.100
uh, environment or climate change, right?

46
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.440
<v 2>Isn't that in essence, what was happening in France,</v>

47
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.940
that they kept raising taxes on gas to do climate initiatives. And that,

48
00:02:55.941 --> 00:03:00.040
that basically started riot. And then you've got the rights to she'll homie.

49
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.540
<v 0>And, um, so, um, and so those,</v>

50
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:09.310
this one half reach people in democracies will not vote to

51
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.350
end civilization full stop. Then you have the second half of the world, uh,

52
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.580
let's say very poor people or relatively poor people who live in countries,

53
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:22.330
which are not democracies, places like that.

54
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.090
Places like China and places like India, the governments,

55
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:29.770
there are not going to forego the possibility of rapid economic

56
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:31.810
growth and becoming rich,

57
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.060
just because people in rich countries demand that we shouldn't land it off

58
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:38.830
them because it is immoral.

59
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.060
And those governments are not going to do it because they are not suicidal.

60
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.720
Even China, which is a totalitarian and awful regime.

61
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.800
And which keeps saying we are going to go carbon free by this state and other

62
00:03:50.801 --> 00:03:54.400
day, they are building a record number of, uh,

63
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.810
coal powered power plants. As we speak. In other words,

64
00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:03.010
they understand that there is nothing

65
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.240
surer to destroy the communist parties hold on power than

66
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:10.870
denying the Chinese people a better life.

67
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.580
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

68
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.560
Is that sort of an offshoot of the rationale that got

69
00:04:16.561 --> 00:04:18.840
us out of the Paris Accords that in essence,

70
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.200
these countries were going to keep doing these things because they had to do

71
00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:25.950
them as they go through their industrial revolutions talking say about China and

72
00:04:25.951 --> 00:04:29.340
India, while we were going to put regulations on ourselves and,

73
00:04:29.341 --> 00:04:30.840
and pay for the brunt of it.

74
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.210
And there was no enforcement mechanism and everything else.

75
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.860
<v 0>I said that it was a part of it is that there is the,</v>

76
00:04:36.861 --> 00:04:38.490
the United States right now.

77
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.700
I don't believe I haven't looked at those figures in a while,

78
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.720
but I don't think that the United States is the largest polluter in the world.

79
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.540
I think that China and India are above us. Now,

80
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.720
here you have four and a half billion people, um,

81
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.950
who are trying to get rich quick and who are spewing a lot of CO2 into the

82
00:04:55.951 --> 00:04:59.760
atmosphere and who are also very competitive with us because they have very low

83
00:04:59.761 --> 00:05:04.590
wages. So to tie ourselves to the Paris climate accord,

84
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.950
uh, was the wrong way to go about it. And you know,

85
00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:12.240
what else happened was that the United States has decreased its

86
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.250
emissions of CO2 per capita at a faster pace than most places in the

87
00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:20.670
world. Why? Because we started, uh,

88
00:05:20.671 --> 00:05:25.140
we started getting rid of our coal power plants and we started introducing more

89
00:05:25.141 --> 00:05:30.090
and more natural gas into our electricity production and natural gas

90
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.360
burns, or rather emits much less CO2 than coal.

91
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.750
And so by simply by innovating,

92
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.800
by basically changing the source of fuel from coal to natural gas,

93
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.690
we were able to decrease our CO2 emissions at a faster click than we would have

94
00:05:45.691 --> 00:05:48.600
been obliged to do under Paris. Alright.

95
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.460
<v 2>Right. So let's move on to trend number four.</v>

96
00:05:50.461 --> 00:05:53.460
I thought this was interesting because I see a lot of talk of this kind of thing

97
00:05:53.461 --> 00:05:57.530
online related to peak population. And we're,

98
00:05:57.531 --> 00:06:00.710
we're putting too many people on this earth. Is it true?

99
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.900
<v 0>Eight is not true. Um,</v>

100
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.770
right now there are 7.8 billion of us.

101
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.390
The global population will peak in about 20, 60, 20,

102
00:06:13.391 --> 00:06:16.630
70 at roughly 909 and a half billion.

103
00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.070
And then it will start declining. There are a number of studies done on this.

104
00:06:21.071 --> 00:06:22.840
The latest one came from landset,

105
00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:26.290
which is a very highly regarded British medical paper.

106
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.460
And what they have concluded is that by 2100,

107
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.350
there will be anywhere between 6.8 and 8.8 billion people in the world.

108
00:06:35.351 --> 00:06:40.060
So roughly 1 billion, less than we have today, or 1 billion more.

109
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.670
I'm very ambivalent about this trend,

110
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:47.800
because I think that because humans are the only entities in the

111
00:06:47.801 --> 00:06:50.470
world capable of actually producing ideas.

112
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.020
If you're going to come up with a cure for cancer,

113
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.880
if you're going to come up for a solution to climate change and fusion reactor,

114
00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.710
you need the human brain to do that.

115
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.490
Artificial intelligence is simply not there yet. So fewer human beings,

116
00:07:03.491 --> 00:07:08.380
we have the harder it will be to produce enough geniuses

117
00:07:08.381 --> 00:07:11.710
to come up with ideas, to solve our problems. Nonetheless,

118
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.070
the reality is that the total fertility rate,

119
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:20.050
which is to say the number of babies that a woman can expect

120
00:07:20.051 --> 00:07:24.910
to have in her life is now roughly around 2.4 or

121
00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:29.860
replacement level is 2.1 replacement level basically means that

122
00:07:29.861 --> 00:07:31.210
if you have fewer babies than that,

123
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.480
the global population starts declining in Europe,

124
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:39.520
in places like Czech Republic, where my ancestors are from or Slovakia.

125
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:45.070
Uh, the total fertility rate is 1.3, 1.4, rather than 2.1,

126
00:07:45.071 --> 00:07:49.030
which is needed just to keep the population steady. And, um,

127
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.020
the only place really, which is above 2.1,

128
00:07:53.021 --> 00:07:57.850
2.4 is Africa. Population of Africa is still going to increase for a while,

129
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:02.890
but globally we have fewer and fewer babies being born

130
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:04.510
per woman. Why is that?

131
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.740
Is because women are getting education and they are getting work.

132
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.870
What happens when a woman gets work,

133
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:14.650
is that the opportunity costs of staying at home and taking care of children

134
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:18.040
increases she can do with her life. Other things,

135
00:08:18.041 --> 00:08:21.130
she can earn a lot of money in the marketplace.

136
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.900
And so she has fewer and fewer babies. This relationship, uh,

137
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:30.250
is we are seeing it no matter which continent, uh, you are looking at it,

138
00:08:30.251 --> 00:08:34.450
we see it everywhere. And we expect that as Africa becomes richer,

139
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:39.970
African women will start having fewer and fewer babies below the replacement

140
00:08:39.971 --> 00:08:40.804
level. Yeah.

141
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.940
<v 2>Some of this stuff feels like it must be,</v>

142
00:08:42.941 --> 00:08:45.610
it must be hard to track because if you were to say, okay,

143
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.860
let's look a hundred years in the future.

144
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:53.050
And with the trends of how people are reproducing right now. Well,

145
00:08:53.051 --> 00:08:58.050
all sorts of other trends change and changes and migration patterns change in

146
00:08:58.051 --> 00:09:01.740
everything else. So that, that explains why it could be 1 billion over or under,

147
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:02.574
right?

148
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.990
<v 0>Correct. It is also based on, uh, on,</v>

149
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.740
on assumptions about economic growth and access to education.

150
00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.770
We expect that the economy will continue to grow. I mean,

151
00:09:12.771 --> 00:09:16.850
if the economy stops growing or if there is a de-growth in certain parts of the

152
00:09:16.851 --> 00:09:17.840
world, uh,

153
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.830
then the relationship between increased wealth and fewer babies obviously ends.

154
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.770
<v 2>If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversation about the</v>
