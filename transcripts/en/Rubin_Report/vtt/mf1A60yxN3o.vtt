1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
<v 0>The truth is these foods are designed to be over-consumed and without</v>

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.060
telling consumers how these foods are gonna, um, you know,

3
00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:12.630
affect their behavior when they try to moderate their consumption of these pita

4
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:13.920
chips or the pint of ice cream.

5
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:18.180
And they end up feeling like moral failures because they just simply can't that

6
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:19.950
I think is where the problem lies.

7
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.420
<v 1>So for most of us then that, uh,</v>

8
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.990
that know that Alzheimer's and dementia that these numbers seem to be increasing

9
00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:34.490
and increasing. And your mom, you said 59 was 58, 58 years old. I mean,

10
00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:35.570
that's incredibly young.

11
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.540
So let's talk about some of those things that you can do before they,

12
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.570
before you're sitting at the doctor's office and they're giving you the 10

13
00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:42.404
medications.

14
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.430
<v 0>Well, yeah, yeah. I mean,</v>

15
00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:46.880
the first thing that you need to realize is that dementia often begins in the

16
00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:48.770
brain decades before the first symptom.

17
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.000
And I saw that nobody was talking about this and that's why I decided to step

18
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:54.540
up, you know, I, it, it,

19
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.420
didn't the fact that I wasn't a medical doctor to me didn't seem like a barrier

20
00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:04.280
to entry because I genuinely believe that people should know how to care for

21
00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:07.610
their bodies and their brains. And we're just not taught this. Um,

22
00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:10.670
we're fed misinformation from every conceivable angle,

23
00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:13.940
whether it's the food industry and the way that they market their foods, uh,

24
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.170
making health claims on their products to the way that, uh, the media, um,

25
00:01:18.171 --> 00:01:21.890
reports on, on health studies and research and things like that.

26
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.050
So I think, I mean, what I've learned is that you really,

27
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.700
uh, that the, the, the standard American diet is toxic essentially.

28
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.850
And anything that you can do to run in the opposite direction.

29
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.880
<v 1>So what is the standard American diet, if you're painting that picture,</v>

30
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.830
what does that really look like? There are.

31
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.780
<v 0>There are images that you can, like,</v>

32
00:01:41.781 --> 00:01:45.230
you can go to Google images and you can search for the average, uh, you know,

33
00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:48.470
shopping hall for your typical American family over the course of a week.

34
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.480
And essentially it's all processed foods, um, ultra processed foods to be,

35
00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:55.040
to be more clear today,

36
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.430
60% of the calories that we're consuming come from what are called ultra ultra

37
00:01:58.431 --> 00:02:01.160
processed foods, um, which are made in factories.

38
00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:04.580
They usually are the processed permutations of wheat, corn, and rice,

39
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.480
maybe some soy.

40
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.060
And they generally are what food scientists refer to as being

41
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:15.110
hyper palatable. So they they're extremely calorie dense.

42
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.820
They're not satiating. In fact,

43
00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:19.400
they actually can make you hunger hungry later on.

44
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.270
<v 1>They often put additives in there, right. That actually make you want more,</v>

45
00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:25.070
right. Isn't that the Dorito effect or something?

46
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.301
<v 0>Yeah. I mean,</v>

47
00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:30.710
these foods are just they're they're they become impossibly delicious when you

48
00:02:30.711 --> 00:02:35.270
combine sugar, fat, salt, um, you know, these are,

49
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.021
I mean,

50
00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:40.880
each of these flavors were relatively scarce in antiquity and

51
00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:42.920
today they're just abundantly available.

52
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.850
Like sugar would be available to a Hunter gatherer, you know,

53
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.700
once per year, when it was summer and the fruit, you know, became ripe. Um,

54
00:02:51.701 --> 00:02:52.720
and even then the,

55
00:02:52.721 --> 00:02:56.240
the fruits that would be available to one of our ancestors would be a fraction

56
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.320
as sweet as they are today.

57
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.340
<v 1>Right?</v>

58
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.230
The amount apples that you would have to eat to get the sugar levels that you

59
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.660
can get in a bag of sour patch kids or something.

60
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.760
<v 0>Like the ancestral, Apple is like a crab Apple, essentially. And today they're,</v>

61
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.670
you know, we have like these cosmic crisp apples that are amazing. Like,

62
00:03:11.671 --> 00:03:15.300
don't get me wrong. I'm a huge fan of, of apples,

63
00:03:15.301 --> 00:03:19.350
but they're bred to contain more starch and sugar than ever before in any in

64
00:03:19.351 --> 00:03:20.730
history. And they're also bread.

65
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.180
A lot of our produce now is being bred to remove these bitter compounds,

66
00:03:24.181 --> 00:03:28.110
which are actually compounds that probably produce the greatest health benefit

67
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.730
when we consume them like polyphenols and flavonoids and things like that. Um,

68
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.950
so sugar fat we know is, is highly delectable. Uh, you know, I mean,

69
00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:42.360
it sends off, um, our, our, you know, brain's reward centers.

70
00:03:42.361 --> 00:03:45.330
Like it's one of the reasons why we put half and half in our coffee.

71
00:03:45.331 --> 00:03:48.960
It just allows flavors to linger on the tongue. Um, and then salt, you know,

72
00:03:48.961 --> 00:03:52.110
the word salary derives from salt. It was, uh,

73
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.900
it was something that was it's super important. You know,

74
00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:58.080
we need it for good health. Um, sodium is a macro mineral.

75
00:03:58.081 --> 00:04:01.140
It's also one of these nutrients has been demonized over the past couple of

76
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.170
decades, but you combine them all together.

77
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.940
And it's basically like the 4th of July fireworks in the brain and it makes it

78
00:04:08.941 --> 00:04:11.820
impossible to moderate our consumption of these foods. And so one of the,

79
00:04:11.821 --> 00:04:14.010
one of the ideas that I put forth in the genius life,

80
00:04:14.011 --> 00:04:18.180
I try to really make dietary recommendations without further harming people's

81
00:04:18.181 --> 00:04:18.991
relationship with food.

82
00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:21.780
I think people today have this fractured relationship with food.

83
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.580
<v 1>I always see what, uh, when I'm at trader Joe's, they have guilt-free, uh,</v>

84
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.650
pita chips. And I'm always like the fact that the world,

85
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.450
the word guilt is on there.

86
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.230
Like if like the idea that you'd be buying a regular pita chip and feel guilty

87
00:04:34.231 --> 00:04:39.030
about it is kind of crazy putting aside whether you want carbs or breads or

88
00:04:39.031 --> 00:04:42.900
whatever, but like the way it's all marketed guilt, these are guilt free.

89
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.420
So you can walk out of here and you're not going to feel guilty.

90
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.640
Like that's not the stuff you should feel guilty over it.

91
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.050
<v 0>Oh, it's ridiculous. I mean,</v>

92
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.970
the truth is these foods are designed to be over-consumed and without

93
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.620
telling consumers how these foods are gonna, um, you know,

94
00:04:58.621 --> 00:05:02.220
affect their behavior when they try to moderate their consumption of these pita

95
00:05:02.221 --> 00:05:03.510
chips or the pint of ice cream.

96
00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:05.610
And they end up feeling like moral failures because they,

97
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.540
they just simply can't that I think is where the problem lies.

98
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.700
On the other hand, if you actually are aware that these foods, um, you know,

99
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:18.480
they're so easily over consumed, uh, then it,

100
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.100
it becomes informed consent, you know,

101
00:05:20.101 --> 00:05:22.200
then you actually know what you're opting into,

102
00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:24.530
and then there shouldn't be any guilt about that. You're just making it,

103
00:05:24.531 --> 00:05:26.340
you're an adult making a decision, which you should be able to do.

104
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.450
You should be able to eat whatever you want.

105
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.870
But the problem is I think that most people don't know that these foods actually

106
00:05:30.871 --> 00:05:34.530
drive over consumption. There was a great study that was published. And I,

107
00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:38.910
I wrote about what these hyper palatable ultra processed foods do to our

108
00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:41.370
behavior in genius foods. But since genius foods came out,

109
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.800
there was a great study that was published. Um,

110
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.110
it actually was funded by the national institutes of health,

111
00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:48.480
and they found that when people were given, um,

112
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.910
all you can eat access to an ultra processed diet,

113
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.200
it's called ad libitum feeding that people tend to over consume about 500

114
00:05:55.201 --> 00:05:58.460
additional calories, uh, to reach the point of satiety.

115
00:05:58.461 --> 00:06:01.460
So to just eat until to a point of fullness,

116
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.580
people tend to over consume about 500 calories a day.

117
00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.540
<v 1>And you're more inclined to do that by eating process,</v>

118
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.880
just because of the way they're making you feel.

119
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.500
<v 0>Bagels, muffins, pizzas, burritos, chicken dishes, um,</v>

120
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.800
potato chips sandwiches, things like that. You know, the foods that are,

121
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.450
that are primarily, uh, package shelf, stable, um,

122
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.420
devoid of moisture, which actually can, can, um,

123
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.680
be satiating when food has water in it. But, you know, water is a,

124
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.180
it makes food spoil it.

125
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.670
Like you have to remove the water to make a product shelf stable.

126
00:06:33.671 --> 00:06:37.270
So they're not satiating. They can often induce what's called by phasic hunger.

127
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.840
So they can make you hungry later on. And yeah,

128
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.950
500 additional calories of that a day that might not seem like a lot,

129
00:06:44.951 --> 00:06:48.520
but stretched out over the course of a week. That's a pound of fat gain. Um,

130
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.060
and then they, so it was a crossover study. And when they put these same people,

131
00:06:52.061 --> 00:06:55.270
when they gave them access to foods that were minimally processed, again,

132
00:06:55.271 --> 00:06:58.480
ad libitum feeding, they were able to eat until they were full. Um,

133
00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:59.950
to the same degree of satiety,

134
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.850
they actually under consumed about 300 calories a day.

135
00:07:03.851 --> 00:07:06.700
So what that's going to do is lead to effortless weight loss.

136
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.490
So that's really kind of like the switch that I think people need to,

137
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.830
people need to be aware of that. You know, we,

138
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.120
we tend to think that we have full agency when it comes to our meal choices,

139
00:07:16.121 --> 00:07:20.590
but we don't. I mean, we're, um, our actions are the end result of,

140
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.350
of an interplay between hormones, neurotransmitters,

141
00:07:23.351 --> 00:07:25.990
which are ultimately influenced by the types of foods that we're eating.

142
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.410
<v 1>More than anything else, though. You're always as someone that cares about this,</v>

143
00:07:29.411 --> 00:07:30.880
and you're trying to get people to change their habits.

144
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.330
It's really always about fighting a marketing machine that is oddly ahead of

145
00:07:34.331 --> 00:07:35.290
you. So like,

146
00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:39.280
if you just turn on television and every commercial you see for like a breakfast

147
00:07:39.281 --> 00:07:43.150
food, suddenly they try to make everything healthy. But you know,

148
00:07:43.151 --> 00:07:45.490
it's like an egg that you're cracking this thing.

149
00:07:45.491 --> 00:07:48.820
And then it's got all this other stuff already in there and it's sorta seems

150
00:07:48.821 --> 00:07:51.460
healthy. You're kind of like, Oh, I'm eating an egg in the morning.

151
00:07:51.461 --> 00:07:52.390
And it kind of seems right.

152
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.780
And then I'm sure that when you look at the instructions or the, uh,

153
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.340
ingredients on the back, it's like, yeah, the sodium and everything else, but,

154
00:07:59.341 --> 00:08:02.710
but you have to fight that constantly because they're marketing it all as

155
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:03.580
helping.

156
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.370
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, food marketing, it's, uh, you know, they,</v>

157
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:10.090
they put products at eye level, they market to children, you know,

158
00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:13.360
they get those they've, they've forged those habits early in life.

159
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:18.160
They become exponentially more difficult to break. Um, but yeah, I mean,

160
00:08:18.161 --> 00:08:22.240
I think it's, I'm human. So I had processed foods too, right? Like, I'm,

161
00:08:22.241 --> 00:08:26.920
I'm just as guilty as anybody else. But I think to be aware, I mean,

162
00:08:26.921 --> 00:08:28.480
knowledge is power at the end of the day.

163
00:08:28.481 --> 00:08:32.170
And to be able to act on that knowledge. I mean, that's the most empowering, um,

164
00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:34.990
aspect of all of this, because you know,

165
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.340
like health is something that health care is something that we,

166
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.640
that we do. And we're like pushing the shopping cart through the, you know,

167
00:08:42.641 --> 00:08:45.490
the aisles of the supermarket actually avoiding the aisles because that's where

168
00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:49.690
all the ultra processed foods tend to tend to be. And, you know,

169
00:08:49.691 --> 00:08:52.780
when we're debating with ourselves, whether or not to get to the gym, um,

170
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.700
that's really where healthcare happens.

171
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:58.950
What I with my mom was sick care and the relative lack of options.

172
00:08:58.951 --> 00:09:03.270
Once you actually have one of these like chronic diseases that has set in.

173
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.340
And so at the end of the day, the food industry doesn't have your back.

174
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:12.000
Um, I mean the food industry is great in many, it's not.

175
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.670
<v 1>It's an industry. It's not all bad. I mean, food is.</v>

176
00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.520
<v 0>Food is safer, you know, we're,</v>

177
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.400
we're exposed if you were pathogens than ever before. Um, you know,

178
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.720
the hunger is less of an issue today than it is in the past if you're in the

179
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.880
developed world, the developed world,

180
00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:30.060
but a lot of these conditions that we're seeing society now struggle with her

181
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:34.170
lifestyle mediated, they're mediated by, um, being, you know,

182
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.710
overly sedentary by basing our diet around these ultra processed foods. And.

183
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.730
<v 1>You know, it's funny, I'm noticing now at whole foods,</v>

184
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.610
just because we're in the midst of this odd thing with Corona virus,

185
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.620
that nobody, at least at my whole foods,

186
00:09:45.621 --> 00:09:49.040
nobody's touching the grains that you can do yourself. You know,

187
00:09:49.041 --> 00:09:51.410
they've got that wall of grains. It's like,

188
00:09:51.411 --> 00:09:54.170
nobody's even going over there anymore, which is probably I guess,

189
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.600
good at the moment, but you know, who does?

190
00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.650
<v 0>Yeah. A lot of people are now using these hand sanitizers, if you like,</v>

191
00:10:00.651 --> 00:10:04.940
go on Amazon, it's there, the markup has just shot up exponentially.

192
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.110
Um, but something that I think few people appreciate is that when you use a hand

193
00:10:09.111 --> 00:10:11.990
sanitizer, before you go shopping,

194
00:10:11.991 --> 00:10:13.550
and then you touch the store register receipt,

195
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.460
the store register receipts are actually coded with bisphenol a,

196
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:20.330
which is a pretty potent endocrine disruptor that hand sanitizer,

197
00:10:20.331 --> 00:10:21.860
when you use it just before,

198
00:10:21.861 --> 00:10:24.590
or even just after you touched these receipts that actually dramatically,

199
00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:27.890
by at least an order of magnitude increases, um,

200
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:29.630
the permeability of your skin to these companies.

201
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.800
