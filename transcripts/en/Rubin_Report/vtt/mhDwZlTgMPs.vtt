00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.240
<v 0>The restaurant industry is being challenged. Unlike others, you know,</v>

2
00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:07.260
there's many States where tipped employees get paid about two 20 an hour,

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.100
and it's an employee tip credit of, you know, whatever it is,

4
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:16.050
$13 an hour to adjust their payroll down. So these employees typically make 20,

5
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:20.370
30, $40 an hour in tips in many of these places. So they make two 20 now.

6
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.020
And payroll from two 20,

7
00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:26.550
an hour to $15 is a 600% payroll

8
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:27.384
increase.

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.460
There is no business in a world that can sustain a 600% payroll increase.

10
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.160
So I'm trying to protect my industry.

11
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.030
I'm trying to protect the people that work in the industry by creating a stable

12
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:42.900
economic model. So there is no guilt and stability.

13
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.120
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

14
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.830
<v 2>That small businesses, the guy that just wants to make a great bar,</v>

15
00:00:57.831 --> 00:01:01.100
a great restaurant, not, not a franchise, not a big business,

16
00:01:01.101 --> 00:01:05.750
but the guy that wants in his hometown to just put the greatest restaurant ever

17
00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:06.584
there,

18
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.280
that they will have looked at what happened over the last year and be like,

19
00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:12.920
you know what? The risks, risks always. I'm sure you know,

20
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:14.480
the numbers for restaurants and bars.

21
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.310
If you want to tell everybody the failure rates, they're always absurdly high,

22
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.410
but now the risks seem almost incalculably high for people to want to get in on

23
00:01:24.411 --> 00:01:25.244
this.

24
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.960
<v 0>You know, it's interesting that you mentioned,</v>

25
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.950
I own a franchise called Taphorn Tavern and we created this franchise.

26
00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:33.830
You'll find this interesting, and I'm not doing this as a plug. We, we,

27
00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:37.790
two years ago had no way rapport. We were approaching $15 minimum wages.

28
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.300
And the labor pool that we did have were mostly new Americans who didn't speak

29
00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:42.950
English so well. So I said,

30
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.530
I got to create the casual dining concept of the future.

31
00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:48.950
So I want to cut labor costs in half. I want to bring in robotic cooking,

32
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.720
robotic ovens, eliminate back of the house, uh,

33
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.880
create this whole new restaurant model. So I did,

34
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.570
I worked with companies like Middleby and worked in test kitchens around the

35
00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:03.020
country and created this kitchen of the future concept a year ago,

36
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.120
created called Peffers Tavern.

37
00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:08.900
Did our franchise registration started the franchise COVID happens.

38
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.050
We find out we don't have any raw protein in our restaurant.

39
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.860
It's all Suvi cooking. Everything is individually wrapped, prepared,

40
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:18.170
and computerized ovens. It's really high quality.

41
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.980
So we don't have raw and cooked product. We don't have Greece,

42
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.090
we don't even have hoods. So we have a very different cooking model. It,

43
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.470
it is the kitchen of the future.

44
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.500
We are the most COVID safe kitchen in the world.

45
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.970
We didn't even design it this way. So now we put uniforms on our kitchen staff.

46
00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:36.200
We have cameras in the kitchen,

47
00:02:36.201 --> 00:02:38.540
so you can see your food be prepared right on your phone.

48
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.620
And we created the safest cleanest kitchen concept in the country,

49
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.810
starting on a whole different basis.

50
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.930
So I watch my franchises and I'm answering your question for you,

51
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.960
cause this is interesting. They haven't, we sold a bunch of franchises.

52
00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:52.910
We sold Washington. We sold the Atlanta.

53
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.400
A whole bunch of territories would do it very, very well.

54
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.710
The franchise is going COVID hits shoe sales,

55
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:03.310
stop a franchises about 45 days later,

56
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:05.500
we get a phone call from some people that say, listen,

57
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:08.830
we're a franchise company. We're interested in buying your franchise.

58
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:12.580
And here's why we want to buy it now because we think some of the greatest

59
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:16.060
restaurant locations in America are going to become available in the next 90

60
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:16.894
days.

61
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.490
And we want to jump on those locations with a concept that has good,

62
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:24.820
solid economic modeling. And, you know, it's an interesting,

63
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:28.330
I never quite thought that way. So we just sold the city of Boston.

64
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.130
We just sold the city of Washington,

65
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:34.810
DC to sophisticated developers who are now dropping them in places like Faneuil

66
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:37.120
hall. Cause these locations have become available.

67
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.420
My point is this there's opportunity now,

68
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.230
and the industry is going to go through a shift. There's no question about it,

69
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.140
but there's great locations that are going to be available.

70
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.430
Now there's aggressive landlords who will give you a very aggressive deals right

71
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:55.810
now with 10 and allow in packages and free read for a year or two. I mean,

72
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:58.330
they will bend over backwards to do those deals.

73
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.900
So to that fictitious restaurant guy that we were just talking about,

74
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.650
who's scared to do it. Maybe this is the time to do it.

75
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.620
And I put a fascinating thought model out there.

76
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.140
Now we have a big to go element that we've put in,

77
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:13.240
in tappers Tavern and a curbside element.

78
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.140
So we shifted the business model post COVID, obviously Dave,

79
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.800
but my point is this. If you've ever wanted to be in a restaurant business,

80
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.090
one of the highest costs we got is occupancy and construction today.

81
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:27.310
There's unbelievable opportunity out there.

82
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.160
Don't just think that COVID is bad for the industry.

83
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.330
It could be good for the industry to, uh, for some people in the end.

84
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.790
<v 2>Yeah. Interesting chaos. Yeah. Well, chaos always brings opportunity.</v>

85
00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:42.030
I'm actually glad you brought up the automated kitchen and mentioned a little

86
00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:43.710
bit about the economics of some of this,

87
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.490
because it is something that I talk about a lot on the show relative to minimum

88
00:04:47.491 --> 00:04:50.280
wage and the rest of it. So for you as a guy that won,

89
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.810
I know you want to employ people.

90
00:04:51.811 --> 00:04:55.110
You want people to feel empowered and feel like they have some control in their

91
00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:58.350
lives and all that when you're making those decisions to go, well,

92
00:04:58.351 --> 00:04:58.861
wait a minute,

93
00:04:58.861 --> 00:05:03.750
I can't pay these people $15 an hour because technically they're not worth it.

94
00:05:03.751 --> 00:05:07.260
If they don't speak the language and all that without getting into all the

95
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:10.680
specifics of that. D D do you have sort of like a,

96
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.820
almost like a philosophical struggle there between how to go ahead and do a new

97
00:05:14.821 --> 00:05:18.870
business that isn't going to hire as many people potentially. Uh,

98
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.060
but he's going to be more of say a restaurant of the future and,

99
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:24.510
and something that's sustainable. That's your, that's your whole point.

100
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.580
<v 0>Yeah, honestly, no. Uh, and of course there's a personal fact.</v>

101
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.320
You want to hire as many people as you can. You know,

102
00:05:31.321 --> 00:05:35.040
my proudest day is when I had about 900 employees and I used to sit,

103
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.250
think to myself every night I put about a thousand meals on the table every day.

104
00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:40.140
I was really proud of that. But you know,

105
00:05:40.141 --> 00:05:44.400
today my responsibility is sustain the jobs of the people that work for me to

106
00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:47.730
provide them with an opportunity that is consistent is going to last and provide

107
00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:49.890
them with a good income. Bigger.

108
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.580
It doesn't necessarily mean more stable doesn't mean more income for everyone

109
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.580
also. There's what about the guy who built all the robotics,

110
00:05:56.581 --> 00:05:59.600
who programmed all the systems, they got jobs that didn't have them before.

111
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.820
So I don't think I'm eliminating jobs.

112
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:05.630
I think I'm redistributing those jobs a little bit into technology plays rather

113
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:08.270
than just straight cook lines. But, but, you know,

114
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:12.440
I think that the restaurant industry is being challenged. Unlike others.

115
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:12.651
You know,

116
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:16.640
there's many States where tipped employees get paid about two 20 an hour,

117
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.510
and it's an employee tip credit of, you know, whatever it is,

118
00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:25.430
$13 an hour to adjust your payroll down. So these employees typically make 20,

119
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:29.780
30, $40 an hour in tips in many of these places. So they make two 20 now.

120
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.430
And payroll from two 20,

121
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:35.960
an hour to $15 is a 600% payroll

122
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.823
increase.

123
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.870
There is no business in a world that can sustain a 600% payroll increase.

124
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.540
So I'm trying to protect my industry.

125
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.440
I'm trying to protect the people that work in the industry by creating a stable

126
00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:52.310
economic model. So there is no guilt and stability.

127
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.530
There is no guilt and following, you know,

128
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.180
economic models that provide prosperity for those who work for us. So, uh, it,

129
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:01.700
isn't my choice. I'd much rather be hiring more people,

130
00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:03.530
but it isn't something I have any guilt about.

131
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.390
<v 2>Yeah. I, I love the answer. I mean that, that's the honest answer.</v>

132
00:07:07.391 --> 00:07:10.330
And unfortunately we've got a lot of business owners these days that would give

133
00:07:10.331 --> 00:07:12.010
you the guilt answer, uh,

134
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.160
to just sort of pretend they're doing the right thing as opposed to actually

135
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.350
actually doing the right thing. Um, if somebody,

136
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:22.480
if somebody is watching this right now and they're young and they always wanted

137
00:07:22.481 --> 00:07:25.390
to get into the biz, um, you know, you talked about a,

138
00:07:25.391 --> 00:07:29.560
a long resume of doing basically everything. What would you recommend? I mean,

139
00:07:29.561 --> 00:07:32.300
is, is the first job just to be a bar back or,

140
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:35.860
or do you have like a specific idea on how they get in on this?

141
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:36.821
<v 0>Yeah. You know,</v>

142
00:07:36.821 --> 00:07:40.300
I think the most important two jobs are wine cook and a bar back,

143
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.930
you are in everything from those two positions are bartender. So, you know,

144
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.100
I'm of the belief that,

145
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.910
that you should not go into this business until you at least 10 bar and work in

146
00:07:48.911 --> 00:07:52.000
a kitchen. Uh, those are the two areas where waste occurs.

147
00:07:52.001 --> 00:07:55.390
Those are the two areas with theft occurs. Those are the two hearts of the,

148
00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:58.480
of the business. If it breaks down there. And either of those places,

149
00:07:58.481 --> 00:08:00.340
you have no business. Uh,

150
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.240
the worst thing in the world in a restaurant industry is to be held hostage to

151
00:08:04.241 --> 00:08:05.074
ignorance.

152
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.800
I can't tell you how many friends I've had over the years that have opened

153
00:08:08.801 --> 00:08:12.580
restaurants that have never been in a business before they hire a chef, right?

154
00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:15.610
They pay them X amount of dollars a year. They're open 60 days. The chef says,

155
00:08:15.611 --> 00:08:18.220
this is all on me. I won equity or I'm leaving.

156
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.560
And the guy who owns it doesn't know how to cook a steak,

157
00:08:20.561 --> 00:08:24.880
or doesn't even know one of his own recipes. He's held hostage by his ignorance.

158
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:29.620
This is a challenging business, you know, think of, of a retail store,

159
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.830
but the t-shirts go bad after three days. How about that?

160
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:37.360
Imagine a t-shirt shop that they right away after three or four days, you know,

161
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.500
th th th that the staff that we have to manage production,

162
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.760
we have to manage retail, manage merchandising, manage staff, manage purchasing.

163
00:08:45.761 --> 00:08:50.470
It's a very difficult business and you can't do it from a point of ignorance.

164
00:08:50.471 --> 00:08:52.240
Those are the people who fail. And it's interesting day,

165
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:57.270
because if you look at the statistics about one of eight succeed for first-time

166
00:08:57.271 --> 00:09:00.900
operator, seven of eight succeed for the second time,

167
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.340
wow. It's a fascinating shift in the statistics.

168
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.330
So once you made those mistakes, the first time, they've just sort of ready now,

169
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.340
but without the experience,

170
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.460
you're not in a very good statistical place with the experience you're in a far

171
00:09:14.461 --> 00:09:15.510
better statistical place.

172
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:21.140
<v 2>What resources can we send people to? Are you still doing seminars on?</v>

173
00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.310
<v 0>Oh, sure. Yeah, sure. We still do seminars. You can go to Jon taffer.com.</v>

174
00:09:25.311 --> 00:09:25.761
Matter of fact,

175
00:09:25.761 --> 00:09:27.980
we're working on an industry webinar in the next couple of weeks,

176
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.560
so you can go visit Jon taffer.com. You know,

177
00:09:30.561 --> 00:09:32.810
there's great resources out there for restaurant people,

178
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.120
please go to the national restaurant association site.

179
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.750
They have wonderful COVID information, great marketing programs and such.

180
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.410
There's another organization, a nightclub and bar show and media group,

181
00:09:42.411 --> 00:09:45.740
which also has great information on it. And then of course, you know,

182
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.300
we have our TVT,

183
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.830
which is about 40 hours of training content marketing promotion that we have

184
00:09:51.831 --> 00:09:55.760
that's available on our website. Also, my point is this, you know,

185
00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:59.180
when this pandemic started and I'd like to sort of be positive here for a

186
00:09:59.181 --> 00:10:03.110
minute, Dave, you know, when this pandemic started, I saw people get paralyzed.

187
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.600
They didn't know what to do. They were frozen. You know,

188
00:10:05.601 --> 00:10:09.140
my second book about excuses, which we talked about, you know,

189
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.890
I realized that at this time, great marketers are going to bubble to the top.

190
00:10:12.891 --> 00:10:15.230
Aren't they we're going to see some amazing stuff.

191
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:17.390
Great promoters are going to bubble to the top.

192
00:10:17.391 --> 00:10:21.740
We're going to see great activations and programs and online events and great

193
00:10:21.741 --> 00:10:23.720
operators are going to bubble to the top.

194
00:10:23.721 --> 00:10:25.910
We're going to see incredible things happen out there.

195
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.850
So this is a time to mobilize, not parallel.

196
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.870
