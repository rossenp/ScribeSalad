00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.260
<v 0>How's it going everybody. It's your friendly neighborhood, Dave Rubin.</v>

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.330
You normally see me wandering the mean streets of Los Angeles with my dog.

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.260
But today I am in the swamp.

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.250
I am in Washington, DC,

5
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.340
the most wretched hive of scum and villainy.

6
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.240
And I am here wandering around first off. It's a complete ghost town.

7
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.840
There are no other humans here. I'm in a zombie movie with nose homies.

8
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.310
That's what it feels like. It's like, we, it,

9
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.810
it has the eerie feeling of a zombie movie. And yet the zombies,

10
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.660
I guess there's a little sun out. So this armies aren't coming outside.

11
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:41.220
So I'm basically in, I am legend right now. I'm will Smith and I need a dog.

12
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.650
I really do need a dog. There's there's there's cracks in the street.

13
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.400
Plenty of cracks in the street in this dystopia. All right, well,

14
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:57.510
I am with another human here. All right. We got a thousand people and I am here.

15
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.080
Morning, ladies and gentlemen, with my agent slash bodyguard.

16
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.890
<v 1>The pre pubescent service agents.</v>

17
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.210
<v 0>[Inaudible] my secret service agent. He's keeping me safe on the main streets.</v>

18
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.180
I will be shocked if you see another human in this video,

19
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.640
there's nobody anywhere. Kyle.

20
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.500
<v 1>If you don't wear a mask outside, you'll be shot. You know,</v>

21
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.610
these are the rules. How it's her tank comes up and blast you off.

22
00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:23.444
Sometimes you go to jail.

23
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.890
<v 0>There's nobody here. We could run DC. You think Trump's even at the white house.</v>

24
00:01:27.891 --> 00:01:28.870
I feel like we could just walk in.

25
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.720
<v 1>No doors taking your seventh nap of the day in Calabasas at the moment.</v>

26
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.883
She's not here.

27
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.430
<v 0>Unbelievable. If you want to tell the people about your mere math problem.</v>

28
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.380
<v 1>Yes. So Kyle's got an.</v>

29
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.760
<v 0>Issue with masks. You know, everyone, the mass thing I walked in,</v>

30
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.660
I went into an office and I did have to put a mask on, um,

31
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.910
I considered robbing them at gunpoint, but then at the last second,

32
00:01:49.911 --> 00:01:51.330
I say that I'll just go to.

33
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.850
<v 1>So my mask is not as bougie as it's not the fight. My issue.</v>

34
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.520
I've never had acne as a kid. Never, never.

35
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.290
And now it's popping over everywhere.

36
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.830
<v 0>Adult acne. That's one of the side effects of this thing. You know what I mean?</v>

37
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.320
People talk about the side effects of COVID, but they're not.

38
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.410
<v 1>Nobody talks about the side effects of my face, breaking out. Now,</v>

39
00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:13.790
obviously COVID is real, you know, but you know, this is, I can't wear makeup.

40
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.950
I can't, I don't know how to put on makeup. Right?

41
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.031
<v 0>So the question is,</v>

42
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:20.540
do you want to shut down the world economy forever and usher in a new world

43
00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:22.850
order and have acne at the same time.

44
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.000
<v 1>And then Amazon is going to send you the skin supplies to like fix my face.</v>

45
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.070
And now this, this is the roundabout. Yeah.

46
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.300
<v 0>Anyway, as you can see, we have not seen another human being. There's nobody.</v>

47
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.770
There's nobody. There's.

48
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.340
<v 1>There's one woman across the way we still are in DC or lobbyists and they're</v>

49
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.623
defective zombies.

50
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.410
<v 0>Oh, wait. I'm almost gotten to get into, Oh, there's a car.</v>

51
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.660
There's a car with a man. All right. Very.

52
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.030
<v 1>Exciting. Yeah.</v>

53
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.920
<v 0>We're trying to find a place to eat. We're starving.</v>

54
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.540
Everything's closed a lot of things. Boarded up. I just like a Turkey sandwich.

55
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.040
Just to, could I get a Turkey sandwich or wrap? Maybe a salad. Nothing is open.

56
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.410
Nothing. There's nothing, but we're we're out here. Cause it looks,

57
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.110
listen, look at this. It literally, it looks.

58
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.390
<v 1>Everyday. We're fighting the good fight out here in DC. Okay. Every day. No,</v>

59
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.170
we can't cross. We'll get run over. Listen, we're here fighting corruption.

60
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.600
I'm here fighting skin acne. I do a lot for the people,

61
00:03:15.601 --> 00:03:17.550
for the American people and people don't respect that.

62
00:03:17.551 --> 00:03:21.300
People don't appreciate the full extent my audience respects it for what I do

63
00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:22.134
for us.

64
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.370
<v 0>Anyway. So, um, I'm in DC for about 24 hours. Uh,</v>

65
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.610
this afternoon, I'm going to the white house Hanukah party.

66
00:03:29.611 --> 00:03:32.850
We're going to celebrate eight crazy nights. Uh,

67
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.100
of those pesky Jews survive in the green.

68
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.850
<v 1>If I post a photo that looks like champagne, it's not champagne. It's wine.</v>

69
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.320
<v 0>Yes. Yes. If I post a picture or a video drinking champagne,</v>

70
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.880
it most likely is champagne. Um, so yeah, we're, we're heading,

71
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.130
we're heading to the white house in a little bit. Um,

72
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.070
I actually just this morning I was just sitting, having coffee at the,

73
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.331
at the Trump hotel.

74
00:03:54.331 --> 00:03:57.180
And I bumped into judge Jeanine who I've done her show a million times,

75
00:03:57.181 --> 00:04:00.530
but we'd actually never met in person. So it's kind of fun when you know,

76
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.990
we're going to a real restaurant, if there's a real restaurant. Um,

77
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.950
but it's fun when you actually meet these people in real life, you know,

78
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.210
because I, I think for, for you guys too, you just see,

79
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.780
you see all this, how's it going, man? How are you going? All right. See, good.

80
00:04:15.781 --> 00:04:18.060
We saw real people. We've been trying to find real people.

81
00:04:18.061 --> 00:04:21.030
You guys are real human beings. I'm not I'm on Periscope right now.

82
00:04:21.031 --> 00:04:24.930
Is that cool? Yeah. So real finally, we were trying to find real people in DC.

83
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.650
We couldn't find any, you guys are real humans, humanoids in any way,

84
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.640
real people. Can you believe it? Incredibly cool.

85
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.540
It's good to meet you guys take it easy. Real people,

86
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.930
real Rubin report people. That's what I'm talking about, man.

87
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.470
People in DC and we found it. All right. That was incredible. Did he see,

88
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.710
I touched the guy. Do I have to disinfect my hand now?

89
00:04:45.711 --> 00:04:47.230
I probably shouldn't say that publicly. Yeah.

90
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.130
<v 1>It was just, no, I mean now the FBI and CIA are on your.</v>

91
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.100
This is how it goes to jail.

92
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.340
<v 0>This is it, people. This is it. All right. So, so yeah.</v>

93
00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.750
So I saw judgey Dean this morning and it's nice when you see like actual people.

94
00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:03.690
I think one of the things happening right now is we don't see human beings

95
00:05:03.691 --> 00:05:06.900
anymore. And if you do see human room, good food, right?

96
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.210
If they're wearing a hat like this and we've got glasses like this,

97
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.260
and now I understand why Kylo Ren took off the mask every now and again,

98
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.603
you know.

99
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.550
<v 1>I'm not there yet on the star Wars episodes. So I haven't seen it.</v>

100
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.350
I'm working off I'm on episode six and five.

101
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.290
<v 0>You didn't watch your budget. Let's not get killed here. Look at this.</v>

102
00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:23.280
There's nobody.

103
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.790
<v 1>Anywhere. No.</v>

104
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.970
<v 0>Buddy. There's a couple of cars. I don't know where they're going.</v>

105
00:05:29.971 --> 00:05:33.660
They're all fleeing. Oh, by the way, if you see that little,

106
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.890
little scar on my forehead, I was going to a,

107
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.630
to a rally in Los Angeles the other day to, to rail against this woman,

108
00:05:42.631 --> 00:05:46.050
Sheila Kool who's, one of the city supervisors who shut down all the,

109
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.510
all the outdoor meals, all the outdoor reading.

110
00:05:48.511 --> 00:05:51.480
And then she went for an outdoor meal. She literally voted on it.

111
00:05:51.481 --> 00:05:55.650
This woman who makes $300,000 a year to do Jack,

112
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.760
she voted to close all the outdoor restaurants.

113
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:00.260
And then she went to an outdoor restaurant.

114
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.830
Cause she knew she had like a 24 hour window before they all closed down.

115
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.150
People are major hypocrites.

116
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.940
<v 1>Or something that they know that we don't like.</v>

117
00:06:06.941 --> 00:06:09.040
They don't actually believe their own rules as well. None of it.

118
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.950
<v 0>No people they're middle-management morons who can't produce.</v>

119
00:06:11.951 --> 00:06:15.010
So they want to control other people that that's it. But anyway,

120
00:06:15.011 --> 00:06:18.820
so I go to this, I'm on the way to the rally to protest this woman.

121
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.840
And we got clipped on the four Oh five. And uh, when I,

122
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.670
when I pulled over, when I pulled over.

123
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.861
<v 1>Telling you his,</v>

124
00:06:26.861 --> 00:06:29.890
he got into a fight with Gavin Newsome and he doesn't want to say it publicly.

125
00:06:29.891 --> 00:06:32.380
They had an MMA match. It was paper for you.

126
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.260
I've been thinking about challenging them. They've won.

127
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.960
<v 0>I would challenge Newsome where Garcetti to a duel,</v>

128
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.570
like maybe that's where this is all headed. You know what I mean?

129
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.020
Like we'll just have to have public duals now. Like good to sure.

130
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.670
You've closed down the old,

131
00:06:45.671 --> 00:06:50.590
the restaurants while you rocking up $15,000 Booz bills at French laundry,

132
00:06:50.591 --> 00:06:52.210
I challenge you to do.

133
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.370
<v 1>I would pay for this. People.</v>

134
00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.570
<v 0>Would pay for that. It's the only way. Anyway. I hope we see it was nice.</v>

135
00:06:58.571 --> 00:07:00.340
At least that the only people we saw knew me,

136
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.030
but where it's everybody like,

137
00:07:04.031 --> 00:07:09.010
is everyone just stuck at home? Someone said, my body guard looks high.

138
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.520
<v 1>No, I look hi. I'm actually not. I'm not.</v>

139
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.100
<v 0>No, no he's not high. Actually.</v>

140
00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:19.060
You want to know a little insider information about us? Twitter.

141
00:07:19.061 --> 00:07:22.390
People were like Twitter. People were going to the white house.

142
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:27.100
Kyle forgot socks. Well, not forgot socks. He only had like ankle high socks.

143
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.300
<v 1>Sorry. I didn't want to repeat. I bought them. I only had these socks,</v>

144
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.170
socks record. I was willing to pay for it. Dave, Oxford generously.

145
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.960
<v 0>Happy holidays. Uh,</v>

146
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.600
and I forgot my belt and you can't go to the white house without a belt.

147
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:44.350
So we went to H and M and we got the fanciest socks and belts.

148
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.880
There is nobody here. I mean, I'm not, when I tell you this, I am not kidding.

149
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.190
There is, there is not a human.

150
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.180
I can literally run around naked in the street.

151
00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.160
It's Chile shrinkage. But like,

152
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.260
there is no buddy here. Yeah. Here's the guy here's,

153
00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:08.260
there's icy woman. We're about to pass a man in a little bit.

154
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:09.640
He obviously is a government agent.

155
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.650
<v 2>Hold on, let me, I don't want to.</v>

156
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.500
<v 0>Speak too loudly. He's obvious this guy is up to no good.</v>

157
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.240
<v 2>Hold on. Hold on. He's not wearing a mask. Hold on, hold on.</v>

158
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.480
All right. You see him that, that was shady. I mean,

159
00:08:25.481 --> 00:08:26.920
this is how you destroyed your country.

160
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:31.330
<v 0>Yeah. This is how you destroy a country. I mean, everything is shut down.</v>

161
00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:33.360
I love DC by the way, you know, I,

162
00:08:33.361 --> 00:08:37.810
I joke about the swamp and everything else and politics and all of that,

163
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:42.130
but DC, DC, you know? So where,

164
00:08:42.131 --> 00:08:44.860
w what part of town are we in right now? And we're basically in Capitol Hill,

165
00:08:44.861 --> 00:08:48.640
right? So we're right by the national mall. Um,

166
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.810
so the Capitol building is that, is that,

167
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.350
so that's the Capitol building right there. Here. We'll, we'll, we'll walk that.

168
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.190
I mean, there's just nobody here. You can't even go. I try to get my brother,

169
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.910
uh, toward, you can't even go into the Senate unless like, you can't,

170
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:05.850
you can't go inside. Where's the, where's the Jefferson Memorial.

171
00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:08.040
I know it's a little off the, off the beat. You know what, maybe,

172
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.610
maybe I'll do like a, something in a little bit. I got,

173
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:14.040
I got like two hours here. Uh,

174
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.820
maybe I'll do something from the Jefferson Memorial because it's not in the main

175
00:09:17.821 --> 00:09:19.020
path that all the memorials, you know,

176
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:21.930
people think people think of the Lincoln Memorial, the,

177
00:09:21.931 --> 00:09:23.250
obviously the Washington monument,

178
00:09:23.251 --> 00:09:25.200
but the Jefferson Memorial really is wonderful.

179
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.080
And they have some of his writing, uh, etched in the wall.

180
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:29.970
And it's really quite amazing.

181
00:09:29.971 --> 00:09:32.430
Do you know what any of these other buildings are? As long as we're here?

182
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:41.100
I mean, these are government bureaucracy everywhere, but that's here.

183
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.660
That's the Capitol. So you can see it.

184
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.680
That's the Capitol building right there. That's funny.

185
00:09:49.681 --> 00:09:51.780
Someone made a good point. I've got my bodyguard with me,

186
00:09:51.781 --> 00:09:54.450
but there's no other people out here. Yeah. Up there.

187
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.190
Somebody doing construction, that's good.

188
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.080
Or they're building the underground bunkers, I suppose. All right.

189
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.230
We're going to grab some lunch. Uh,

190
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.360
I assume the people you're allowed to eat that that's illegal. Figure it out.

191
00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.100
I feel like I'm in a reservoir dogs right now.

192
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:18.990
This guy is this mad max. All right, I'm going to go eat something.

193
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:20.550
And then maybe we'll, uh,

194
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.690
we'll wander over to the Jefferson Memorial or something else.

195
00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:27.420
And I'll try to do something from the white house later. We'll see.

196
00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.390
We'll see what happens. But anyway, man, it's weird. It's weird.

197
00:10:30.391 --> 00:10:33.720
This isn't how people are supposed to live. You're supposed to live free.

198
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.180
You're supposed to wander around and have a little risk in life.

199
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.600
See other humans. Oh God.

200
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.090
I had to be a radical revolutionary.

201
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.940
I just want it to be a sports center anchor. You know that that's the truth.

202
00:10:44.941 --> 00:10:47.760
I just want it to be a sports center anchor. And now I got to save the Republic.

203
00:10:47.761 --> 00:10:51.090
What a headache in the NBA now he's doing well in Washington, DC,

204
00:10:51.091 --> 00:10:55.170
trying to say I know. I know. All right guys. Thanks everybody.

205
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:56.573
