00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.210
<v 0>There have been many cases where he's basically been treated as if he doesn't</v>

2
00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:05.280
exist. They use the wrong photo for him.

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.330
He tweeted out that every other campaign gets to have, um,

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.970
people who represent them on your shows. But with him,

5
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:13.020
it has to be him personally.

6
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.060
So when people on the left are starting to realize, Oh,

7
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.710
this isn't about Republican versus Democrat. This is about us versus them.

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.750
And you could just as easily be a Democrat and be them, eyes are opening.

9
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:29.940
And that is a very, very healthy phenomenon.

10
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.300
I always say that the corporate press is the enemy of the people.

11
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:34.800
And I think that's the moderate position.

12
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.860
<v 2>This is the Rubin report. And according to a Russian bot farm, I'm Dave Rubin,</v>

13
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.500
quick reminder guys, to subscribe to our YouTube channel,

15
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.310
Pretty good. Joining me today is the author of the new right? The host of the,

16
00:00:55.311 --> 00:00:59.720
your welcome podcast and the man that I've dubbed the Willy Wonka

17
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.400
politics. Michael malice. Welcome back to the Rubin report. Thanks so much.

18
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.080
Well, sir, where to start? Um,

19
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.080
I think your outfit. Yeah,

20
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.980
it reminds me of somebody, a former guests.

21
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:17.360
I didn't see you until two minutes ago.

22
00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:20.600
You walked in here wearing this gorgeous little thing. Yeah.

23
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.990
<v 0>Yeah. I've been known for this look four years, is that right?</v>

24
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.850
All of a sudden I get phone calls.

25
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.350
Who's this woman Tulsi who has been dressing like you she's so nuts.

26
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.120
She even put a streak in her hair to pass as me even more. And I looked this up,

27
00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:39.140
she says, she's from this state called Hawaii life. I never heard this.

28
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.900
There's a bunch of volcanoes in the middle of the Atlantic.

29
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.870
And we're supposed to believe that this is a state. They live in volcanoes,

30
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.590
rain of liquid metal that they check the weather. And this is people.

31
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.680
This is how they gerrymander the electoral college.

32
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.660
And now they're trying to say, Graham's a state.

33
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.690
When I asked my friend where's Graham, find to me on the map,

34
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.460
he points this little Island by the booth.

35
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.440
<v 2>You saying glam, glam, Graham, have you ever found, they're making up words.</v>

36
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.450
<v 0>This is how the fake news media gets over it. Anyway,</v>

37
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.480
getting back to her campaign. I think she's great. Yes.

38
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.780
I've been following her very closely and I think it's reprehensible.

39
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.180
What's being done to people like Telsey Gabbert,

40
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.830
the Congressman from so-called Hawaii and all the other democratic outliers. Uh,

41
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.570
this is a wonderful, um,

42
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.800
change in our politics where so many people are realizing the nature of the

43
00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:28.280
enemy.

44
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.110
<v 2>All right. So we're going to talk about all of that stuff,</v>

45
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.530
but because a huge portion of our people just listen to audio.

46
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:36.830
I do feel that I have to describe what you're wearing hunky.

47
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.580
You are in a white leisure suit. It's a suit.

48
00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:43.130
This is a business to have your leisure suit. It seems like a leisure.

49
00:02:43.131 --> 00:02:44.420
So you look like leisure suit Larry,

50
00:02:44.421 --> 00:02:47.960
or you look like Larry from a three's company or something like that.

51
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.730
Or we can do this to John Johnson or John Travolta. Yeah.

52
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.590
Like suit, but you are, no, this is very much the Tulsi Gabard whites.

53
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.070
<v 0>This is the Michael malice look that tells the appropriate.</v>

54
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.860
<v 2>Yes, yes, yes, no. Okay. So you hit, you hit a whole bunch of stuff there.</v>

55
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.380
The reason that I wanted to have you back, because as you know,

56
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.280
I find you to be one of the most interesting political thinkers out there.

57
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.490
I do think there you go. I'm paying you a compliment right? In front. You,

58
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:16.810
you consistently strike me as someone that is always like really on what I would

59
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:20.620
say is the forward fringe of what's happening culturally and politically and the

60
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:23.140
whole shebang. So let's, let's start where you just started there.

61
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.270
That there suddenly seems to be a couple outliers with the Dems and,

62
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.590
uh,

63
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.010
the DNC or the powers that be are the gatekeepers or the New York times or CNN

64
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:35.650
or whatever else you want to call that. Not too happy.

65
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.660
<v 0>Yeah. For a long time, conservatives often get things wrong. Um,</v>

66
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.530
and I criticized them very heavily on my Twitter. And when I speak to them,

67
00:03:43.531 --> 00:03:46.170
I do so with great love and affection. Um,

68
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.540
they have always argued that the media is a wing

69
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.433
of the DNC.

70
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.910
And what we're seeing recently now is it's more accurate to say that the DNC is

71
00:03:56.911 --> 00:03:59.490
a wing of the media because, uh,

72
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.550
you'll see things like anyone who deviates,

73
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.570
as you mentioned earlier from basically the media's party line is crushed.

74
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.750
Let's, let's give an example. I'm a democratic Congressman, right?

75
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.130
Let's suppose from Hawaii or some other, or from a real exists.

76
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.620
And for three years,

77
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.180
my constituents have heard CNN and MSNBC talk about Russia, collusion, Russia,

78
00:04:21.181 --> 00:04:23.190
collusion, Trump's Hitler. Trump's this Trump's that?

79
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.290
How am I as a politician supposed to go back to my constituents and

80
00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:31.560
say with a straight face, I think Trump's the worst president ever.

81
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.830
I think he's a racist concentration camps. Uh, you know,

82
00:04:34.831 --> 00:04:36.690
despicable he's ruined the presidency,

83
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.590
but I don't think this is grounds for removing him from office.

84
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.080
I don't have that space. So it's pretty clear.

85
00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:46.140
Who's the one who was leading the charge and who was following it.

86
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.970
And for a long time, again,

87
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.030
conservative thought this was Republican versus Democrat.

88
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.410
And now we're seeing that it's establishment versus outsider because we're

89
00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:57.900
seeing it, how they treated Tulsi. We're seeing it,

90
00:04:57.901 --> 00:05:00.000
how they treated Bernie and Andrew Yang.

91
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.020
That's the special one because Andrew Yang is hardly some wide-eyed radical,

92
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.650
right? He's a. He's in many ways, akin to Mitt Romney. Uh, you know,

93
00:05:07.651 --> 00:05:10.680
in certain ways he wears the math lapel pin. He wants people to succeed.

94
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.940
<v 2>He's a business guy and mostly a centrist probably,</v>

95
00:05:14.941 --> 00:05:17.970
or not probably certainly way too big government for you. Right? Sure.

96
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.810
But at least you think he's a sort of functional human being and doesn't come

97
00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:22.410
out of the machine.

98
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.150
<v 0>Right. And he is,</v>

99
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.360
there've been many cases where he's basically been treated as if he doesn't

100
00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:29.430
exist. They use the wrong photo for him.

101
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.480
He tweeted out that every other campaign gets to have, um,

102
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.120
people who represent them on your shows. But with him,

103
00:05:36.121 --> 00:05:37.170
it has to be him personally.

104
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.210
So when people on the left are starting to realize, Oh,

105
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.860
this isn't about Republican versus Democrat. This is about us versus them.

106
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.900
And you could just as easily be a Democrat and be them, eyes are opening.

107
00:05:51.901 --> 00:05:54.090
And that is a very, very healthy phenomenon.

108
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.470
I always say that the corporate press is the enemy of the people.

109
00:05:57.471 --> 00:05:59.000
And I think that's the moderate position.

110
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.410
<v 2>What is the corporate press really? Like?</v>

111
00:06:02.411 --> 00:06:07.330
What is the psychological makeup of the corporate press that causes this whole

112
00:06:07.331 --> 00:06:07.660
thing?

113
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.110
<v 0>Sure. So basically what you have are the universities and that's where the evil</v>

114
00:06:11.111 --> 00:06:11.590
starts.

115
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.210
And we've been trained since kindergarten in our government schools to regard

116
00:06:16.211 --> 00:06:18.970
the media as authoritative and as you know,

117
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.480
hardworking people fighting for the little guy and trying to present the truth.

118
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.940
Yet we see many, many examples of the little guy.

119
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.130
Nicholas Sandman is a very obvious example. Uh,

120
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.860
those cadets who were playing the circle game, uh, the guy,

121
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.730
here's an easy example. The guy who Photoshop CNN into that, uh,

122
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.180
gift with Trump, wrestling them, CNN said, we reserve the right to Sue you.

123
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.090
<v 2>To hunt him down and destroy him for creating a meme.</v>

124
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.600
<v 0>Not looking out for the little guy that's looking out for number one.</v>

125
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.700
<v 2>Do you, I I've asked a bunch of guests to this year,</v>

126
00:06:45.701 --> 00:06:48.760
but do you think there's a moment where something changed because it wasn't

127
00:06:48.761 --> 00:06:51.940
always this horrible it's being exposed now more because,

128
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.870
because we can all immediately tweet out the truth. The second, you know, they,

129
00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.070
they pump out the lie,

130
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.090
but do you think there was some other seminal moments somewhere along.

131
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.640
<v 0>It was always this horrible, and this is what conserves don't appreciate.</v>

132
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.370
We all learn in high school about William Randolph Hearst,

133
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.850
the Spanish American war. Remember the Maine and yellow journalism.

134
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.570
And then they just kind of the record scratch. And now we're into today. Uh,

135
00:07:13.571 --> 00:07:17.710
I have a big thread on Twitter. Walter Duranti is a prime example.

136
00:07:17.711 --> 00:07:19.780
He was in New York times, man, covering the Soviet union.

137
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.980
And while Stalin intentionally committed a genocide via starvation of Ukraine,

138
00:07:23.981 --> 00:07:28.270
the Holodomor, he was putting out dispatches all the time saying,

139
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.690
there's no problem. If there is a problem,

140
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.160
it is malevolent propaganda. He said the Russian people, it's a little tough,

141
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.690
but they're tightening their belts.

142
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.830
Tighten their belts is a very interesting idiom in this context. And what they,

143
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.910
what Stalin did to these people is, uh, if you were a Kulak,

144
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.370
which meant land owner, but pretty soon, man, anyone,

145
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.340
if you had any food in your home, that was for the people,

146
00:07:51.341 --> 00:07:55.690
they ran sector house and took it. And if you weren't starving,

147
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.930
that's how they knew you were hiding food and that's who they targeted.

148
00:07:58.931 --> 00:08:01.840
So they would beat people, mercilessly. They would tear their house upside down,

149
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.880
kick them out in the streets, you know, so to start,

150
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.920
and there was another reporter who were willing to this area was forbidden

151
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.940
by the Soviet government. There was a reporter who jumped off the train, uh,

152
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.090
went to a few villages, reported back what was happening, these horrors.

153
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.530
And Duranti was like, Oh, you know, he's just an anti-Soviet agitator.

154
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:23.890
So this has been going on for a very long time.

155
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.540
They've always been hardcore. I call them jihadis without the testosterone.

156
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:29.733
They have been

157
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:36.310
very demented idea ideology that will do everything in its power to maintain its

158
00:08:36.311 --> 00:08:37.144
hold on power.

159
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:42.250
And only now that they've been fact check in real time and called out on their

160
00:08:42.251 --> 00:08:45.460
tactics in real time, are people realizing, Oh,

161
00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:48.550
I'm just gonna say one more point. It's not. I had this tweet yesterday said,

162
00:08:48.551 --> 00:08:51.850
it's not about the corruption. It's about the depravity. If it was just, Hey,

163
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.620
I'm hiring my brother and he's getting paid too much money soon asked no one

164
00:08:55.621 --> 00:09:00.570
would care. This is, we know they do that. That's fine. [inaudible]

165
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.690
this is about Amy Roebuck and Jeffrey Epstein.

166
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:08.550
When you have a network that knows that someone is engaged in this sexual

167
00:09:08.551 --> 00:09:12.780
trade of children and their concern is not getting an interview with Meghan

168
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:16.980
Markle. And when this is exposed, instead of coming clean, it's,

169
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:21.570
let's target the person who revealed this footage and get them fired at the

170
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:22.800
network, which they went to.

171
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.730
<v 2>It's a lot, it's a lot, it's a lot.</v>

172
00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.360
But what do you think about the sort of psychological condition of these people?

173
00:09:29.361 --> 00:09:33.980
Like when I watch all of these clips of CNN anchors

174
00:09:33.981 --> 00:09:38.810
saying the reverse of the truth or Cuomo tweeting out that, you know,

175
00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:42.140
look at the way the right attacks Gretta thunbergii when he went after Nixon,

176
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:43.160
men are just, Oh, you know,

177
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.510
a kid is all of this nonsense that they never stop.

178
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.740
They seem completely psychologically unable to stop.

179
00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.250
And that strikes me as very weird. You know, I sit with a lot of people.

180
00:09:55.251 --> 00:09:58.250
If you were to say something to me that was patently true.

181
00:09:58.251 --> 00:10:00.680
That was against what I believe I would struggle with it. I would,

182
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.430
we would work it through. I would ask you some questions, but I know myself.

183
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.980
I would probably change my mind if you made a compelling case.

184
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.460
We now we're at a point where there's a lot of compelling evidence that these

185
00:10:10.461 --> 00:10:13.850
people lie endlessly and nothing ever stops them.

186
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.830
<v 0>I, I don't even know that I would use the word lie.</v>

187
00:10:15.831 --> 00:10:19.040
And here's why I talk about this heavily in the book I regard, uh,

188
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:22.800
what I call the evangelical left these types when you're, uh,

189
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:27.950
an adherence to a fundamentalist, creed facts do not change your opinion.

190
00:10:27.951 --> 00:10:31.130
In fact, contradictory facts make it double down, right?

191
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:35.210
So if you are talking to someone who is a hardcore creationist and you show them

192
00:10:35.211 --> 00:10:38.150
fossils, they're not going to wonder if creations was wrong.

193
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:42.680
They will regard this as evidence that their willpower and faith is correct.

194
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:47.120
And this is just the test and it's the exact same psychology, the contemporary,

195
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.800
and I don't regard all leftists in this vein.

196
00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:50.840
I regard this specifically as these Jihadi types,

197
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:55.640
they have this vision that they are the ones who are going to save

198
00:10:55.641 --> 00:10:56.690
America and the world.

199
00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.320
And it's the degeneration of what happened a hundred years ago called the social

200
00:11:00.321 --> 00:11:04.340
gospel, which was the premise that instead of an individual being saved,

201
00:11:04.341 --> 00:11:08.300
which is a basic premise of Christianity, it's the nation that has to be saved.

202
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.021
However,

203
00:11:09.021 --> 00:11:13.820
when you have this worldview that a nation's soul can be saved or the earth

204
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:14.810
soul can be saved.

205
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:19.310
That means there is no space that is outside your purview.

206
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.880
That means whatever someone watches, whatever someone does at home,

207
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:27.530
anything aspect of your life is subject to their domination and control.

208
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:31.040
So it is an absolute totalitarian worldview and they admit it.

209
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.460
