1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.230
<v 0>Thank you. You know,</v>

2
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.020
if Kamala Harris were at the top of the ticket right now and descending to the

3
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:07.650
white house, it wouldn't happen there isn't support for it in the United States.

4
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.050
The people don't want it. You know,

5
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:12.900
the FDR couldn't get it through when he controlled his party,

6
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:17.430
Democrats controlled the house and the Senate, and he was hugely popular. Well,

7
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.840
the support right now is 20% lower for packing the court than it was back then.

8
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:22.800
It's not going to happen.

9
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.590
<v 2>I actually read your tweet about Nancy Pelosi and the mandate on,</v>

10
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.910
on my show this morning.

11
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.570
And I was trying to frame it in a way that that will give people,

12
00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:41.840
obviously a lot of my audience likes Trump. So I was trying to say, okay,

13
00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:45.290
if this doesn't work, if this doesn't end up the way you want it to end up,

14
00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:47.810
like, what, what are the silver linings around this thing?

15
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.040
And I agree with you that her tweet or her comment was so over the top that

16
00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:55.430
maybe it gets the Republicans to dig. And then I'm starting to think, you know,

17
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:58.370
I'm not a status generally in like a traditional sense,

18
00:00:58.371 --> 00:01:02.600
but I'm starting to think that maybe instead of the small government that I

19
00:01:02.601 --> 00:01:05.450
really want, maybe we never really get to that.

20
00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:09.560
But maybe the best thing we could have is sort of like an endlessly stalemated

21
00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:13.610
government like that, that basically just can't do anything.

22
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.510
And then what'll happen is every four years we'll have the guy do executive

23
00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:19.420
actions and then the next guy will reverse them. And that,

24
00:01:19.421 --> 00:01:22.550
and that'll just be the way we're governed. And I know it kind of sucks.

25
00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:24.500
And for those of us that do this for a living,

26
00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:28.100
it's like not really what you want, but like maybe in a bizarre sense,

27
00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:30.080
that's the last fail safe that we have.

28
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.250
<v 0>Basis stasis could be, could be okay. Right.</v>

29
00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:38.360
I think that the Democrats would much have preferred status to Trump doing

30
00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:41.510
anything meaningful. And I think that's how the Republicans are feeling now.

31
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.170
I mean, I,

32
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.190
my own sense of it is most Republicans aren't that scared of Joe Biden, the man,

33
00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:49.280
because he has a 50 year history of legislating from the middle,

34
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.470
but Joe Biden is elderly and not totally with it mentally from what we've

35
00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:55.190
seen.

36
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.430
And I think a lot of people are worried that he is just going to be the puppet

37
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.790
and people like AOC and Nancy Pelosi are going to be the puppeteers.

38
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.740
And I realized those two women don't have the same agenda,

39
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.280
but as far as Republicans are concerned, neither is good. Um, you know,

40
00:02:07.281 --> 00:02:09.920
you're not going to have some moderate, um, you know,

41
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.820
Joe mansion pulling the strings on, on Joe Biden.

42
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.510
It's going to be people like that, the squad,

43
00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:17.060
and nobody wants a squad getting in there and telling them what to do,

44
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.150
or just pressuring him so much that he does it. So I think Stacy,

45
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.760
this would be okay, but I think it could be worse than Stacy's.

46
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.330
It could be a bloody civil war sort of if you will political.

47
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.140
So for forgive the reference because, um, if they,

48
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.240
if they do go after Trump, if they, if,

49
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.270
if they decide to go after him legally and put them in jail and I'll do

50
00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:38.450
everything and like, you know, completely go after Trump and his supporters,

51
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.860
you know, the Senate does a lot.

52
00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:41.810
If the Republicans control the Senate and I don't,

53
00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:43.970
I know we're looking at two runoffs in Georgia,

54
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.820
but Georgia Republicans have never lost a runoff in the state of Georgia.

55
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.060
Never not realize we're going to have a huge money dump there to try to change

56
00:02:50.061 --> 00:02:52.250
that this time around. But, and George is changing.

57
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.670
It's becoming bluer obviously, but the odds are on the GOP side.

58
00:02:55.671 --> 00:03:00.640
So let's assume for now, GOP can retains control of the they,

59
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.310
if they retain control of the Senate, the Democrats do all those things.

60
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.020
They're going to make it as ugly and as acrimonious and is unfortunate for the

61
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.350
Dems as possible. A lot of these categories just have to be,

62
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.760
they have to be confirmed by the Senate, right? Like what if, what if, uh, uh,

63
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:19.840
justice, uh, God forbid dies and you need confirmation by the Senate.

64
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.370
Like there there's a lot the Senate can do to stop a president from getting

65
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.181
anything done.

66
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:30.100
And then two years we have another election and the Democrats share of the house

67
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.350
majority. I mean, it's going down like this. As we speak,

68
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:34.810
it's getting smaller and smaller and it could get down.

69
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:38.500
When all of a sudden Dunn's just a four seat advantage by the Dems.

70
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.400
If that happens, they're almost certainly going to lose control in two years.

71
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:44.620
So politics never stops.

72
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.300
If you are just a complete prick two and four years later,

73
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.350
it's going to come back at you.

74
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.970
<v 2>Right? And then when you look at some of the interesting numbers that broke in</v>

75
00:03:53.971 --> 00:03:58.830
different ways that the black men voted more than two times as high

76
00:03:58.831 --> 00:04:01.800
for a Republican, as they did last time and black women,

77
00:04:01.801 --> 00:04:05.280
it went up from 4% to 8%. That's not a huge percentage,

78
00:04:05.281 --> 00:04:09.750
but doubling is pretty good. I saw something this morning that 16%,

79
00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:11.670
I think of Muslims voted for Trump.

80
00:04:11.671 --> 00:04:14.730
Like all things that you just wouldn't expect that, that, uh,

81
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.030
LGBT support for Trump actually more than doubled.

82
00:04:18.031 --> 00:04:20.100
So like there are some interesting signs of future.

83
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.400
How worried are you just about general,

84
00:04:23.401 --> 00:04:26.070
like trust in the whole thing like that,

85
00:04:26.071 --> 00:04:30.900
the same people who said Russia are now saying our election is tamper-proof

86
00:04:30.901 --> 00:04:33.870
right. Like, that's the big one that I'm like seeing the hypocrisy on right now,

87
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.080
you guys ran around saying Russia interfered in our elections four years ago.

88
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.720
Now, now you're telling us because you got what you wanted,

89
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.520
apparently that the system is perfect so that people won't trust the electoral

90
00:04:44.521 --> 00:04:48.600
system. They already don't trust the media system. That, that basically,

91
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.530
you know, all of our, the colleges, just the institutional level,

92
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.160
there is just no trust in anything anymore.

93
00:04:56.161 --> 00:04:59.340
And I can't really fake it for people, you know,

94
00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:02.010
like I wish these things were better, but I don't think they are.

95
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.020
<v 0>Well, some of that concerns me, but most of it doesn't, um,</v>

96
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.310
I think for example, I think Joe,

97
00:05:08.311 --> 00:05:11.160
Biden's not going to pack the Supreme court and that's good because that would

98
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.890
have been a massive move that would have ruined the Supreme court that would

99
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.290
have been the end of the Supreme court. And that would,

100
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.540
would've been a catastrophic breakdown of systems.

101
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.060
<v 2>If it ain't, what if it ain't Joe? Cause I'm with you on that?</v>

102
00:05:21.061 --> 00:05:22.350
I think Joe actually, right.

103
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.500
<v 0>Not the forecourt within the democratic party or writ large there, isn't.</v>

104
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.250
<v 2>You think by him getting in it's it's fed them enough that they won't have to do</v>

105
00:05:29.251 --> 00:05:29.970
like that.

106
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.050
<v 0>I even think if, you know,</v>

107
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.960
if Kamala Harris were at the top of the ticket right now and is sending to the

108
00:05:33.961 --> 00:05:34.794
white house,

109
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.310
it wouldn't happen there isn't support for it in the United States are the

110
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.960
people don't want it. You know,

111
00:05:39.961 --> 00:05:43.560
the FDR couldn't get it through when he controlled his party Democrats control

112
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.370
of the house and the Senate. And he was hugely popular. Well,

113
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.780
the support right now is 20% lower for packing the court than it was back then.

114
00:05:51.781 --> 00:05:53.760
It's not going to happen. People don't want it.

115
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.250
These politicians aren't politically suicidal.

116
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.600
So that was a good talking point by Jeffrey Toobin who really should have been

117
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:03.200
more focused on how to work with zoom than writing provocative articles in the

118
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:07.310
new Yorker about that's never going to happen. Um, and it's, I don't think Joe,

119
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.941
Biden's going to do that.

120
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:10.580
I think the reason he wouldn't answer that when he was running is because the

121
00:06:10.581 --> 00:06:13.970
answer was no, it was to protect his left flank. Uh, you know,

122
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:16.970
him from his left flank not to protect himself from the right,

123
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.440
but I also kind of think that distrust in,

124
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.430
in some agencies can be good and it's,

125
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.800
it's not all destructive. You know,

126
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.670
like I think the media needed to be destroyed and,

127
00:06:32.671 --> 00:06:35.960
and now it will rebuild in some way, shape or form. I mean,

128
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.190
I really think I've said this to you before the, the,

129
00:06:39.191 --> 00:06:43.700
the journalists they've been on a kamikaze mission ever since Trump,

130
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:46.460
I didn't start with Trump, but like he he's the, it was the,

131
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.420
that was the real mission.

132
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.260
They've been on a kamikaze mission to take him down and it wound up being a

133
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:56.000
thing where they did kill themselves. And in the end, they,

134
00:06:56.001 --> 00:06:58.250
they, it does appear. They took him with them.

135
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.250
It does appear they brought him down because if you don't think the media played

136
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:03.830
a role in people's perceptions of Trump these past four years,

137
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.260
as controversial as he is legitimately ban,

138
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.870
that I don't mean to give him a full pass on all the crazy stuff he's done,

139
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.550
but the media did so much of it. So they, they are,

140
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.960
they are a force. I don't want to say for evil, that's too strong,

141
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.680
but they're not to be trusted and they're not what they used to be.

142
00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:23.060
And they're not honest about it.

143
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.870
So they needed to be destroyed and we'll see what comes up.

144
00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:28.580
So maybe that's true in the FBI.

145
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.060
They needed to be unmasked as this political organization.

146
00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:36.350
I had complete trust in James Comey, David, I did, I was like,

147
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.850
Jim, call me, I, you know, the guy wrong.

148
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:46.010
And I'm grateful for having that, you know, that that mask pulled off. And so

149
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.650
I can't totally dismiss the dismantling of distrust of trust and some of these

150
00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.480
organs.

151
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.740
<v 2>Right? Like that. Well, that's what I'm saying.</v>

152
00:07:53.741 --> 00:07:55.870
I'm I'm down with the distrust stuff. I don't,

153
00:07:55.871 --> 00:07:58.420
I don't think they deserve our trust anymore,

154
00:07:58.421 --> 00:08:02.110
but the problem is that it's sort of only got halfway. In other words,

155
00:08:02.111 --> 00:08:05.350
if Trump loses, well, then they'd been on mass, but they're about to rebuild.

156
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:09.700
You can already feel it a little bit like, Oh, they didn't fully get us.

157
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.380
So here we go. Again, something like.

158
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:12.730
<v 0>No, no, I don't think that's right,</v>

159
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:16.810
because they never lost trust with the Democrats. They've had it. I mean,

160
00:08:16.811 --> 00:08:18.730
we're just going to a more fractured media world.

161
00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:21.610
Like the country used to have when we were founded for the a hundred years

162
00:08:21.611 --> 00:08:23.230
thereafter where, you know,

163
00:08:23.231 --> 00:08:26.050
the left has its sources and the right has its sources. But one great thing.

164
00:08:26.051 --> 00:08:30.910
Trump did was make very clear that virtually everybody is on that

165
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.840
first side virtually, but he is actually fighting for Democrats.

166
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.870
There is not a Republican in the country left.

167
00:08:37.871 --> 00:08:42.640
I think that thinks CNN is fair and objective news.

168
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.400
We may be some people who really don't pay attention to the news. Might,

169
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.380
might still think that Republicans haven't been fooled know th the mask has been

170
00:08:50.381 --> 00:08:53.260
pulled off. So that's a good thing, you know,

171
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.310
and I don't think they're going to,

172
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.570
I think they're going to be defensive of Joe Biden. I think quietly,

173
00:08:57.571 --> 00:09:01.290
the Washington post democracy dies in darkness is going to just get pulled off

174
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:05.740
the moon. It's no longer dark, so we don't need,

175
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.820
but I think all of that's great and it gives the audience, you know, it's like,

176
00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:13.320
let me, let me put it to you this way.

177
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.750
If you have a friend who's a real jerk and you didn't, you didn't know it. Um,

178
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.230
I'm trying to think of my one friend's example. So I'll get,

179
00:09:22.231 --> 00:09:26.190
I'll give you this friends of ours, interracial couple, the husband's black,

180
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.550
the wife is white. And after the George Floyd thing,

181
00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:34.980
they were very upset because one of their white friends called them up and said,

182
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.840
how are you doing? I hope you're okay. And then they saw, they found out,

183
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:40.703
Oh no, you know what?

184
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.230
I can't tell the whole story because it will reveal who it was,

185
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:47.220
but it was somebody who they thought was a friend and who they had helped out

186
00:09:47.221 --> 00:09:49.350
with there, with respect to their kid, getting into college.

187
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.460
They had done a lot to help him.

188
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:55.740
And basically the guy got outed as repeatedly saying the N word and really

189
00:09:55.741 --> 00:10:00.660
racist stuff about black people. So they were shocked. They were horrified.

190
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.420
And I said to them, you know what, this is a good thing,

191
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.330
because that was the reality yesterday.

192
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:11.080
And you just didn't know what it's better today to know. And,

193
00:10:11.081 --> 00:10:14.550
and then act accordingly. It's not, it's hurtful to find out,

194
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.230
but it's not better to be in the dark.

195
00:10:16.231 --> 00:10:19.410
And that's how I feel about the media and these organizations,

196
00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:20.850
which really are politically driven,

197
00:10:20.851 --> 00:10:25.260
but we didn't know it may hurt to learn it or not, but it's better to know.

198
00:10:25.261 --> 00:10:26.094
And then act.

199
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.960
