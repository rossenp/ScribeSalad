1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.310
<v 0>I've been saying for a number of years,</v>

2
00:00:02.311 --> 00:00:07.260
that all roads lead to narcissism and for the people I know

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.920
who vote that way, they voted that way.

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.100
And then when it kind of will themselves to be correct,

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.550
because it's his ostensibly, what you're saying is,

6
00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:22.440
is you're a Democrat. Yes. You vote Democrat. Yes.

7
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.670
Then you're responsible for Gavin Newsome and Garcetti.

8
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.260
Yes. Well then you're wrong. The next thing you can say is you're wrong.

9
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.200
You're wrong. And these are people that hate being wrong.

10
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.720
They have huge egos and they never want to be wrong.

11
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.650
So it's like a kind of a cognitive dissonance. It's kind of like, yeah,

12
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.850
I voted for that guy and yeah, he's doing a horrible job,

13
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.250
but I'm going to vote for that party again,

14
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.070
because that way I'll never have to admit I was wrong,

15
00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:53.610
but you are wrong because they're running the state into the ocean.

16
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.220
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

17
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.870
<v 2>And that many public people in Cali that are really publicly fighting the</v>

18
00:01:05.871 --> 00:01:08.390
lockdowns and trying to get people back to work, your whole,

19
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.930
your whole sort of public existence is,

20
00:01:10.931 --> 00:01:15.170
is sort of based around the value of work and your story about work.

21
00:01:15.171 --> 00:01:19.580
And you like it. You like people that work, basically you see value in work.

22
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.930
What do you, what's your take on just the nobody's working? I mean,

23
00:01:23.931 --> 00:01:26.090
we got companies with people working thankfully,

24
00:01:26.091 --> 00:01:28.010
but a lot of people aren't working.

25
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.530
<v 0>You know, I think the, the problem it's, it's, it's kind of a,</v>

26
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.610
it's a leftist Democrat sort of mindset,

27
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.500
which is why do you work? And the answer is to get money,

28
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.630
to buy food, to take care of your family, to pay rent. Okay, well,

29
00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:51.950
what if we just paid your rent and gave you food? And it's like, well,

30
00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:56.900
that would seem to handle the problem mathematically at first glance.

31
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.900
But you're forgetting about a super important part of work,

32
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.020
which is self worth and pride and self-esteem,

33
00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:07.220
and the depression that kicks in and all that, once you get on the Dole.

34
00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:11.690
So their thing is they have this bizarre approach to reverse

35
00:02:11.691 --> 00:02:13.730
engineer. Everything like, Hey, if, if,

36
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.530
if a lot of young black teens are being suspended from schools,

37
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.340
then stop suspending young, black deets. It's like, okay,

38
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.050
that's not going to fix anything. If, if, if homelessness is illegal,

39
00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:31.370
then don't make it illegal anymore. Like this gas in. And it's that way too.

40
00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:35.240
It's like the prisons are overcrowded. How do we fix that?

41
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.220
Let everyone out of prison. Well, that obviously doesn't fix, you know,

42
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.530
the 75% of the kids can't do math at grade level.

43
00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:49.130
Well then lower the test course. It's like, okay,

44
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.320
your car's not going fast enough.

45
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.970
Well then bust the glass of the speedometer and take your finger and turn the

46
00:02:55.971 --> 00:03:00.100
needle up to 80 miles an hour. You're still going 23 miles. Why is it though?

47
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.500
<v 2>I think I've asked you this publicly on the show last time.</v>

48
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:05.110
And I know we've talked about it privately. Why is it though?

49
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:10.060
That so many people cannot make the jump from

50
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:14.410
the stupid decisions to their involvement in the stupid decisions that no matter

51
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:18.160
how many times they voted people in policies that make everything worse.

52
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:19.000
Like right now,

53
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:22.060
if you and I walked out of our studios and we just started talking to people on

54
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:25.660
the street and use that to be like, how's it going in LA? Everybody would say,

55
00:03:25.661 --> 00:03:28.930
man, it's a freaking mess. Or if you said how's Gavin Newsome do.

56
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.050
And they'd all say horrible. Nope. There's nobody defending these people at the,

57
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.530
you know, I get there's the rabid sorta crazies, but pretty much nobody else.

58
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.040
But why is it? And is it, is it just because of the weather?

59
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:42.340
It has fried all of our brains, basically. It's nice out.

60
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:46.540
So people cannot realize that the, the stupid, easy answers,

61
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:48.340
aren't the actual answers.

62
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.780
<v 0>I've been saying for a number of years, that all roads lead to narcissism.</v>

63
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.440
And for the people I know who vote that way,

64
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.570
they voted that way. And then what to kind of will themselves to be correct.

65
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.020
Because his ostensibly, what you're saying is,

66
00:04:07.021 --> 00:04:11.910
is you're Democrat. Yes. You vote Democrat. Yes.

67
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.110
Then you're responsible for Gavin Newsome and Garcetti.

68
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.730
Yes. Well then you're wrong. The next thing you can say is you're wrong.

69
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.670
You're wrong. And these are people that hate being wrong.

70
00:04:23.671 --> 00:04:26.190
They have huge egos and they never want to be wrong.

71
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.120
So it's like a kind of a cognitive dissonance. It's kind of like, yeah,

72
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.320
I voted for that guy and yeah, he's doing a horrible job,

73
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.690
but I'm going to vote for that party again,

74
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.510
because that way I'll never have to admit I was wrong,

75
00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:43.170
but you are wrong because the running the state into the ocean.

76
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.350
<v 2>It has no money. There's homeless people, everywhere. Drug addicts are.</v>

77
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.530
Education's horrible. Do you think maybe we should try voting for somebody else?

78
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.860
Did, did you see when, uh, uh, who was it? Um,

79
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.900
bill Maher had Adam chiffon and Mars complaining. Mara's going, Oh,

80
00:04:57.901 --> 00:05:01.380
all of my friends are leaving LA because of high taxes and blah, blah, blah.

81
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.440
And shifts like, Oh, well, we're the business friendly party.

82
00:05:04.441 --> 00:05:06.270
And it's meaningless what he's saying, of course.

83
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.450
But I want it to kind of smack bill Maher through the TV and be like,

84
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.740
what are you talking about?

85
00:05:10.741 --> 00:05:13.200
You are the one that's supporting all of these people.

86
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.110
And then all your friends leave. And you wonder why you're alone.

87
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.510
<v 0>Well, sometimes they don't even say, we're the party of, they just go, well,</v>

88
00:05:21.511 --> 00:05:26.220
people are leaving because of over-regulation and high taxes and a bad

89
00:05:26.221 --> 00:05:28.170
business environments. Like, yes,

90
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.690
they're leaving because of all the policies you enacted,

91
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.600
those are your policies. That's why they're leaving. Yeah.

92
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.290
<v 2>They, they seem to be unable to make that, that jump lockdowns.</v>

93
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.870
I know you're not happy. You're as as I am.

94
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.750
You're you're tweeting about it all the time. Do you think there's any,

95
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.310
like on the science level,

96
00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:47.010
do you just think there's any science behind any of this? At this point,

97
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.740
there are a lot. I mean, again, right now we could both walk out.

98
00:05:49.741 --> 00:05:51.060
We live about 20 minutes away from each other,

99
00:05:51.061 --> 00:05:54.120
but we can walk outside of our house. It's a beautiful day, as it always is.

100
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.060
We cannot sit outside and have a, because of lockdowns.

101
00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.610
<v 0>Yeah. At a place where you purchase a coffee. I think you could,</v>

102
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.560
we could probably go up to your roof deck.

103
00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.490
<v 2>Actually. I, well, you are welcome on my roof deck, but according to Garcetti,</v>

104
00:06:12.491 --> 00:06:13.630
you're not supposed to be on my right.

105
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.380
<v 0>Oh, right. Well, a lot of it is, you know,</v>

106
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.320
most of it is the crops are dying.

107
00:06:20.321 --> 00:06:24.280
We need a Virgin to throw in the volcano and someone goes,

108
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.130
how's that going to help the crops? And they go, you shut up.

109
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.420
I got to do something. The villagers are upset. They want action.

110
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.430
I mean, whoever the, the, uh, health minister or,

111
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.780
or czar or whatever of Los Angeles is much as admitted it, like I said,

112
00:06:40.781 --> 00:06:44.560
outdoor dining, isn't dangerous. We don't have any data to support.

113
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.450
It's dangerous, but we want people to stay home.

114
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.100
<v 2>But you're not making that up. That is what the guy said. Yeah. Okay.</v>

115
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.510
<v 0>Well, first things first, do you get to decide who stays home?</v>

116
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.890
That's your job?

117
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.630
Your job is I will decide when you get to leave your house.

118
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.690
And even if it's for spurious reasons,

119
00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:09.400
and there is no direct correlation between any danger of spreading the disease

120
00:07:09.401 --> 00:07:10.480
and eating outdoors,

121
00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.950
I'm still just going to make this random decision and you shall stay home.

122
00:07:14.951 --> 00:07:17.350
I mean, it's a very, it's funny. It's a,

123
00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:22.120
it's a comment that kind of slid by a lot of people, but it's,

124
00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.920
it's a very scary precedent when the powers that be are

125
00:07:26.921 --> 00:07:31.870
essentially saying you're going to stay home because I told you to stay home and

126
00:07:31.871 --> 00:07:35.590
then you go, give me proof why I should stay home. And they go,

127
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.200
I don't have to give you proof. I told you to stay home.

128
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.660
<v 2>Are you shocked? How quickly we all became sheep? I mean, everybody, everybody.</v>

129
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.860
<v 0>Well, what, what, what I've realized, what,</v>

130
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:52.780
what has happened is California, especially Los Angeles,

131
00:07:52.781 --> 00:07:56.050
especially it's. So over-regulated,

132
00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.580
it's so burdensome it's so it's so

133
00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:01.900
tyrannical and its,

134
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.770
its leaders are so tyrannical in terms of its burden that they put on the

135
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:11.260
taxpayers that we all got sort of indoctrinated into this slowly.

136
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:16.270
Like Magine trying to pull this off in 1955. Right?

137
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.860
People viscerally like, uh, no, I'm not staying home. And by the way, I'm I'm,

138
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.800
by the way, when I leave my house, I'm taking my gun in case one of you,

139
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:29.170
try to try to arrest me. Like that's where we would be at. But it was a slow,

140
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:34.120
quiet indoctrination of, I mean, think about what you can't do.

141
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:38.560
Here's what you can't do. Here's what you must do. Here's all the things,

142
00:08:38.561 --> 00:08:41.710
you know, you, you can't smoke in a restaurant. Okay.

143
00:08:41.711 --> 00:08:44.920
Well go to the smoking and no smoking. Oh, then I'll go to the bar. No,

144
00:08:44.921 --> 00:08:48.100
no smoking at the bar. Well then I'll go to the patio, no smoking a bad,

145
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.190
like it's such a crazy, um,

146
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.550
Stockholm syndrome that everyone lives.

147
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.960
Everyone that in California has a kind of a Stockholm syndrome.

148
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:02.700
Like I would S I say all the time, Hey, your business, your restaurant.

149
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.610
There's no reason why you need to shut down your outdoor dining.

150
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.970
You've made a lot of concessions. You spent a lot of money just eff.

151
00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:12.390
These guys stay open. And I was like, ah, I don't want to get into trouble.

152
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.990
Well, that's what the overregulation has created. This, this,

153
00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:20.250
this huge sort of umbrella, always, you know,

154
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:24.300
under the guise of safety and everyone is just scared, but,

155
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:27.420
but slowly scared, like, just think about,

156
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.070
think about, you know, what? Think about the beach.

157
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.560
I always talk about the beach, but think about the beach.

158
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:39.150
Like imagine telling someone from the fifties and Malibu, Hey,

159
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:42.000
you can't have that cigarette on the beach. Ooh. What are you doing?

160
00:09:42.001 --> 00:09:45.150
I'm drinking a beer. You can't drink a beer on the beach. I mean,

161
00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:49.770
you look at the sign. I always tell everyone, look at the sign at the beach.

162
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.480
Uh, in the fifties, they didn't have a sign. At some point it was like,

163
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:58.980
no bonfires between 3:00 AM and 6:00 AM. You know what I mean?

164
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:03.330
Now? It's like, no Frisbee, no dogs, no football,

165
00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:08.190
no cigarettes, no, no humans, no humans. Like literally.

166
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.710
Yeah, no humans on the beach. And when, think about what,

167
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.360
think about how they ratchet it up. Think about how the sign gets longer.

168
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.340
They always add something to the sign.

169
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.940
They never remove something from the beach sign every year.

170
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:24.060
There's two more things you can't do on the beach.

171
00:10:24.061 --> 00:10:26.220
And when you go physically look at the signs,

172
00:10:26.221 --> 00:10:29.670
now it is a scroll of things.

173
00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:32.580
Citizens can't do on our beach.

174
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.290
