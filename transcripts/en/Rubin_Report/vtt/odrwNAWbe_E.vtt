00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.980
<v 0>You know, you look at the dystopian,</v>

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.760
dystopian worlds.

3
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.670
One of the elements of it is everyone is frozen in their place.

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.620
Socialist countries, communist countries. There are rich people.

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.430
They're powerful people. What you don't see as new rich people,

6
00:00:17.431 --> 00:00:19.440
what you don't say. You know,

7
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:24.390
when my dad in 1957 was a teenage kid from Cuba,

8
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.260
couldn't speak English, washing dishes, making 50 cents an hour.

9
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.490
Why did he come to America?

10
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.480
Because this is a country where you could be a teenage kid,

11
00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:35.160
washing dishes and climb the,

12
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.390
that socioeconomic ladder and kind of worked out for his kid.

13
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.060
It, if someone had told my father in 1957,

14
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:46.680
that 50 years in the future,

15
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.900
his son would be in the Senate that teenage immigrant

16
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.660
could never have believed. And, and that,

17
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.380
but if we can have conversations, then we can say, all right, what works?

18
00:00:58.381 --> 00:00:59.490
What doesn't work?

19
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.370
The left is afraid to have those conversations. Their ideas don't work.

20
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.400
<v 2>Let's push a little further on this. So,</v>

21
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.860
because the left wants to use state power in a way that

22
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.500
generally speaking the right doesn't want to,

23
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.480
or at least that you don't want to,

24
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.870
if we're to go on this dystopian future idea,

25
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.550
are you worried that if these guys really take power, I mean,

26
00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:38.450
they're going to start jailing political opponents. They are going to use,

27
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.170
we know they've already used the IRS to do all sorts of crazy things. I mean,

28
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.210
these are things that are sort of conspiracy theories.

29
00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:47.600
And then suddenly at this point, nothing feels like a conspiracy theory.

30
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.490
<v 0>But it's all justified in the end.</v>

31
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.300
There's a self-righteousness to it. We're right.

32
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.130
Anyone who disagrees is evil,

33
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.540
therefore anything is justified to suppress the evil.

34
00:02:02.541 --> 00:02:07.190
You see that with cancel culture where people go like

35
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.960
get driven out out of the public discourse. Look,

36
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.700
w when I was in college, I was a college debater. Yes,

37
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:17.570
I was one of the cool kids.

38
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.770
But so I was in college. I was the,

39
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:27.310
the chairman of the conservative group in, in the debate debate society. And,

40
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.840
and w one of my closest friends was the head of the liberal group.

41
00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:32.690
And we would have arguments about free enterprise and socialism,

42
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:37.100
like what works, what actually benefits humanity.

43
00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:39.320
And actually that question is an important question

44
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.700
too often. People start with the assumption.

45
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:48.290
The other side wants humanity to suffer. If we start with the premise,

46
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.801
okay,

47
00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:53.720
most people of Goodwill would like people to be happier and more well off

48
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:55.970
and more prosperous. We start with that premise.

49
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.750
Then we can have a conversation about what systems

50
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:06.610
produce more prosperity, more opportunity. It's it's, you know,

51
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.940
couple of years ago, I did three CNN town hall debates with Bernie Sanders and,

52
00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:15.070
and they were 90 minutes long. And Bernie looked to Bernie's credit.

53
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:18.880
He's an unabashed socialist. I disagree with him, but he's honest.

54
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.080
And we can have a conversation about, you know, socialism.

55
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:26.350
I think if you look across the world, it doesn't work.

56
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:31.300
It's produced misery poverty, suffering, death. Um,

57
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.950
you know, my family fled Cuba.

58
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.700
And so I'm more than happy to take the American free enterprise system,

59
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.010
or as the left derisively calls it capitalism and put it up next to

60
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:45.490
communism or socialism or any dictatorship they've implemented in every,

61
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:50.080
any country on earth. And people are better off. They have more opportunity.

62
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:54.940
And, and in particular, there's the mobility. You know,

63
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:56.980
you look at the dystopian, um,

64
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.340
the Stopes in worlds,

65
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.220
one of the elements of it is everyone is frozen in their place.

66
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.170
Socialist countries, communist countries. There are rich people.

67
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.010
They're powerful people. What you don't see as new rich people,

68
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:14.020
what you don't see. You know,

69
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:18.940
when my dad in 1957 was a teenage kid from Cuba,

70
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.840
couldn't speak English, washing dishes, making 50 cents an hour.

71
00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.070
Why did he come to America?

72
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.060
Because this is a country where you could be a teenage kid,

73
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:29.960
washing dishes and climb the,

74
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.290
that socioeconomic ladder and kind of worked out for his kid. It,

75
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.640
if someone had told my father in 1957,

76
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:41.230
that 50 years in the future,

77
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.480
his son would be in the Senate that teenage immigrant

78
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.670
could never have believed. And, and, and that, but if we can have conversations,

79
00:04:51.671 --> 00:04:54.040
then we can say, all right, what works? What doesn't work?

80
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.920
The left is afraid to have those conversations, their ideas don't work.

81
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.390
All right. There, there's a joke that I tell sometimes, which is

82
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.470
how many radical leftists does it take to screw in a light bulb?

83
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.940
That's not funny, guys. Just relax, like,

84
00:05:13.941 --> 00:05:18.640
like, like lighten up. And, and, you know,

85
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.530
I was talking about in college when we were debating, we'd go, you know,

86
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.430
I, he called me a fascist, I'd call him a, uh,

87
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.840
a communist. Then we could get a beer. Like just, you know,

88
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.490
not all of life has to be, I must destroy my enemy. And there's a lot of that.

89
00:05:36.491 --> 00:05:36.640
Right.

90
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.330
<v 2>But do you think there's a fundamental reason for that?</v>

91
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.560
I think there actually is that, that lefties now,

92
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:44.670
and not always,

93
00:05:44.671 --> 00:05:48.000
and I actually want to ask you about what it used to be like when there was a

94
00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:49.620
sort of sane democratic party.

95
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.600
But if there's a fundamental reason for the anger and the outrage and the

96
00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:59.330
perpetual craziness, which is they believe government is everything.

97
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:02.870
And that, you know this as a Senator, it's a pretty freaking messy,

98
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.590
probably often miserable game that you have to play you to be,

99
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.170
to be a politician in America or probably anywhere.

100
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.150
And that because their whole world view is through politics as opposed to a

101
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:17.660
religious or some other spiritual worldview. Well, of course,

102
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:19.760
you're going to be endlessly miserable. Do you think I'm,

103
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.343
ball-parking something there?

104
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.680
<v 0>So I do. And, and it's, you know, it's interesting.</v>

105
00:06:26.681 --> 00:06:31.180
I was talking the other night to a gentlemen,

106
00:06:31.181 --> 00:06:35.800
he and his wife came from Cuba and came from Cuba, flat under,

107
00:06:35.801 --> 00:06:39.010
under Castro. And he was talking about, he said, you know, Ted,

108
00:06:39.011 --> 00:06:41.950
you talk about the constitution quite a bit. And he said,

109
00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:44.200
I think there are a lot of people like me, who,

110
00:06:44.201 --> 00:06:48.850
who came from countries with constitution was meaningless and they don't

111
00:06:48.851 --> 00:06:50.890
necessarily understand why that matters.

112
00:06:50.891 --> 00:06:54.820
And that they're a little bit skeptical of what,

113
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.030
why should the constitution make a difference?

114
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:03.100
And I was agreeing with him in that we need to explain that more

115
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.320
government power,

116
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.900
the history of humanity is largely a history of government

117
00:07:10.901 --> 00:07:14.330
oppressing the people. Now you need some government, I'm not an anarchist.

118
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.340
You need government to, to protect your,

119
00:07:17.341 --> 00:07:21.340
your fundamental rights to life. To Liberty, to property. John Locke wrote,

120
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.040
wrote about the, the fundamental natural rights.

121
00:07:24.041 --> 00:07:26.530
You need government to impose rule of law.

122
00:07:26.531 --> 00:07:30.070
And we see countries that don't have that are disasters,

123
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:35.410
but the more power government has the less Liberty you have.

124
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.840
Jefferson had a great way of putting it.

125
00:07:37.841 --> 00:07:42.640
He described the constitution as chains to bind the

126
00:07:42.641 --> 00:07:47.350
mischief of government. Um, you look at the first amendment,

127
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.660
free speech

128
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.420
is not about silencing those who disagree with you. Um,

129
00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:00.370
religious Liberty. It's not about forcing everyone to practice your faith.

130
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.540
It's about saying, look, it's up to you. What faith you practice or not at all.

131
00:08:04.541 --> 00:08:04.901
That's,

132
00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:09.610
that's that right of conscious that you get to decide that it's not government

133
00:08:09.611 --> 00:08:14.260
that comes in, you know, you just had, all right.

134
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.500
You know, you talked about abortion. You, you and I may disagree on abortion,

135
00:08:17.501 --> 00:08:21.460
but you just had Joe Biden a week ago. Say if he's elected,

136
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.730
he's coming after the little sisters of the poor.

137
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.730
<v 2>No, I'm completely against that, by the way. I mean, I've done videos on it.</v>

138
00:08:27.731 --> 00:08:28.390
Yeah.

139
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:31.510
<v 0>I mean, that is an extreme view.</v>

140
00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:35.290
You literally have politicians saying those Catholic nuns,

141
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:40.510
I'm going to go after them and force them to, uh,

142
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.670
pay for abortion inducing drugs.

143
00:08:42.671 --> 00:08:46.450
And these are nuns who have taken vows of poverty or helping the poor and the

144
00:08:46.451 --> 00:08:48.250
sick and the needy and,

145
00:08:48.251 --> 00:08:53.230
and government now for years has been persecuting

146
00:08:53.231 --> 00:08:57.450
them because must conform. And it's just look,

147
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:01.470
I think being libertarian and live and let live, giving people like

148
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.310
re roofs, respecting diversity,

149
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.330
solves a lot of the problems we have in the country.

150
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:11.720
<v 2>So, so speaking of diversity then,</v>

151
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.050
do you ever feel it because you mentioned your father and your family's story

152
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.820
because you're a Republican because you're on the right. That in many ways,

153
00:09:19.821 --> 00:09:22.670
the people who love to scream about diversity all day long,

154
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:26.630
they've sort of stolen that from you. I know you don't waive it as a,

155
00:09:26.631 --> 00:09:31.610
as a victim card, but your own personal family story. And because you're,

156
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.820
you're, you look white, so to speak and because you're on the right, you're,

157
00:09:35.821 --> 00:09:39.260
you're just a white guy. Congratulations.

158
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:44.630
<v 0>Look, I, on social media, it is amazing. You look at some of the,</v>

159
00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:49.460
some of the angry protestors who sometimes

160
00:09:49.461 --> 00:09:51.950
are Angley angry,

161
00:09:51.951 --> 00:09:55.580
rich white guys who were telling everyone look,

162
00:09:55.581 --> 00:10:00.380
the riots that occurred following the horrific killing of George Floyd.

163
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.730
Many of the neighborhoods that were burned down were African-American

164
00:10:04.731 --> 00:10:05.564
neighborhoods.

165
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.910
Some of the most poignant and powerful videos were of residents.

166
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.680
