1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.740
<v 0>We were at war when I was press secretary. So things are also different. Um,</v>

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.400
but let's say something was happening and it was a national security issue.

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.930
And somebody within the government suggested I say such and such

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.870
answer at the briefing. Well, when I did,

5
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:20.610
because I was a reporter by training is I would double check and

6
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:23.340
triple check. So I had my deputies and I would say, Gordon,

7
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.320
can you call the national security council?

8
00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:30.000
See if this is what they say is going to call, um, DOD,

9
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.140
you call the CIA, let's meet back here in 20 minutes.

10
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.040
And if everybody has the same answer, I'll say it at the podium.

11
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.880
And if we don't, then I would go to the cheapest staff's office. And I'd say,

12
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.770
we got a problem here because everybody's not settled and we have to get this

13
00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:48.870
right, because people's lives are on the line.

14
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.860
<v 2>I liked it.</v>

15
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.140
You said this thing about that you needed sort of this unforced break. Do you,

16
00:01:02.141 --> 00:01:05.240
do you think a lot of people are suddenly feeling that like,

17
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.160
just the way life is and how fast everything seems to move and social media and

18
00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:14.060
the 24 hour news cycle that you're well aware of that we suddenly got this

19
00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:16.580
break. And of course it's not for a good reason, but that,

20
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.810
but basically if you're okay right now and you've got a roof over your head,

21
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:24.170
and hopefully you have a couple of bucks that there really is an incredible

22
00:01:24.171 --> 00:01:27.380
opportunity to kind of look at your life and look at the world a little bit

23
00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:28.214
differently.

24
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.290
<v 0>Absolutely. If you read any, um,</v>

25
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.310
anyone saying like, w what, what do you really want in your life?

26
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.470
Or what it's that people feel over busy?

27
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.350
I made a new year's resolution that when people said,

28
00:01:42.351 --> 00:01:46.280
how are you doing this a couple of years ago that I would stop saying I'm so

29
00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:49.040
busy because everybody is so busy.

30
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.810
Everybody is trying and striving and doing, nobody says, Oh, I'm fine,

31
00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:56.720
totally kicked back. I get eight hours of sleep a night. Everything's good.

32
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.890
Everybody has stuff. So I stopped saying that a couple of years ago,

33
00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:05.450
and that was a good sort of mental shift for me. Um, and I,

34
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.580
but I know it in myself. Um,

35
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.750
I have a very hard time saying no to opportunities that come my way.

36
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.310
Everything's amazing. Especially like in New York city, would you, you know,

37
00:02:16.311 --> 00:02:19.250
would you speak at this event for this wonderful charity,

38
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.450
but what about for this veterans group? And I can be out,

39
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.860
we night every single night of the week,

40
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.590
and then trying to catch up on life on the weekends.

41
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.840
And what I've realized is that you've having to tap the brakes because we have

42
00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:38.960
to all do our part in this pandemic. It's been,

43
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.710
it's been actually really good for me and I don't have,

44
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.910
I know that I can't hold on to this completely when all of us returned to

45
00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:48.170
normal. Um,

46
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.310
but I would like to figure out a way that I could hold onto a little bit of it

47
00:02:52.311 --> 00:02:56.720
because I, it is better for me a lot better.

48
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.830
Yeah.

49
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.640
<v 2>Well, it's interesting. It's one of the why I like doing your show,</v>

50
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:03.370
because even though you're doing informational stuff,

51
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:05.710
you're doing like the daily grind political stuff,

52
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.250
like there is this other feeling that I think you have that a lot of shows kind

53
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:10.060
of miss,

54
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.210
which is that there's something that's going on in the world at all times that

55
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:16.690
doesn't have to do with politics. Exactly. And I think for you guys,

56
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.670
one of the cool things for me over the last couple of years,

57
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:21.610
as I've gotten to know, I would say you, Greg, Gutfeld,

58
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:24.910
who's a good buddy of yours and Tucker Carlson specifically. It's like,

59
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:26.080
when we watch you guys,

60
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:29.440
there's something a little bit different about watching someone on cable news

61
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.670
than on the internet. Like, it's almost like, are these people actual humans?

62
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.430
And I think you've been able to now show that window like, Oh,

63
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.680
there's a human here. Here's the dog. We're real people that,

64
00:03:39.681 --> 00:03:41.110
that actually has been nice during this.

65
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.550
<v 0>You know, it's interesting. I give, um, Greg,</v>

66
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.730
Gutfeld a ton of credit for actually bringing me along on that,

67
00:03:47.731 --> 00:03:51.870
because we started the five in July of 2011.

68
00:03:51.871 --> 00:03:56.070
And before that I'd been the press secretary and that's a pretty serious job.

69
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.210
And even though I was in the public eye, um,

70
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.020
I didn't do a ton of personal things. Like, well,

71
00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:07.210
we didn't have Instagram or Twitter then. So I,

72
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.500
I didn't really share my life because I thought who would care? Well,

73
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.260
then we start doing the five and we would be asked,

74
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.920
what do you think about this? And almost always,

75
00:04:16.921 --> 00:04:20.850
I was instinctively giving the answer as if I was still the white house,

76
00:04:20.851 --> 00:04:25.770
press secretary for George W. Bush. And at what point Greg said, no,

77
00:04:25.771 --> 00:04:29.520
what do you think? And it was about drug legalization,

78
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.450
marijuana legalization. I've never smoked pot. I'm not into it.

79
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.660
I have a very unpopular opinion. I don't think it's a good idea,

80
00:04:36.661 --> 00:04:38.970
but I realized I just froze.

81
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.670
And I had never given my personal opinion about anything out

82
00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:45.504
loud.

83
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.160
And he pushed me a little and teased me a little and made it

84
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.140
okay for me to kind of just more be myself and not have to be the

85
00:04:55.141 --> 00:04:57.690
press secretary so much anymore. Um,

86
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.930
and so I get asked an interview sometimes.

87
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.610
Is there something that people don't know about you like, Nope,

88
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.300
it's been 10 years. We've been doing the five and I was on red eyes.

89
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.530
There is pretty much nothing that people don't know about me.

90
00:05:13.531 --> 00:05:17.250
So Greg actually really helped with that. And then especially on the five,

91
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.520
we take our S we take the new seriously,

92
00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:22.380
but we don't take ourselves that seriously.

93
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.840
And life is life can be sweet and God meant for us

94
00:05:27.841 --> 00:05:32.700
to be joyous. And I've really learned that from president George Bush to, um,

95
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.380
we worked very hard,

96
00:05:34.381 --> 00:05:39.360
but we were always celebrating the joys of getting a chance to serve at

97
00:05:39.361 --> 00:05:42.540
the highest levels of government for the best country the world's ever seen.

98
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.050
<v 2>Yeah. So, all right. Let's back up to that for a second.</v>

99
00:05:46.051 --> 00:05:47.820
So for the people that don't know, you just referenced,

100
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:50.370
but you were press secretary for George W. Bush.

101
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.870
That means you're the person I remember watching you back in the day you were up

102
00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:58.910
there, ants. Yeah. Yeah. You're answering, you're answering,

103
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:00.680
or at least to the best of the ability of a press,

104
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:03.860
secretary answering a lot of tough questions related to foreign policy and the

105
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:06.560
economy and all kinds of stuff. Um,

106
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:11.210
can you give me like some insight into what that job was like then versus

107
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:14.960
maybe how it is now? I mean, Trump barely has to use a secretary,

108
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.180
a press secretary, cause he was just kinda out there and,

109
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:20.780
and then the networks now, CNN doesn't even cover those things anymore. Uh,

110
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:24.320
you guys cover it, but how that sort of has changed over, you know,

111
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:26.360
it's been about what 20 years or so 15 years.

112
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.270
<v 0>W it was interesting, um, in January of 2009,</v>

113
00:06:31.271 --> 00:06:36.070
so January 20th, 2009, uh, the bushes turned things over to the Obamas.

114
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.810
I was there for the last day. And then Peter, I left for Africa.

115
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.600
We went to South Africa for two weeks vacation in two weeks,

116
00:06:43.601 --> 00:06:47.440
volunteering at a PEPFAR site. And I really,

117
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.210
I wanted that time to reset my priorities, reset my marriage,

118
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.220
reset my brain, and to get ready for this transition. But I think back on that,

119
00:06:57.221 --> 00:06:59.950
and I didn't even have a Twitter account at that point.

120
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.720
And if you think just that, that was 2009, thinking 10 years,

121
00:07:04.721 --> 00:07:07.330
how things changed so dramatically. Um,

122
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:12.280
and you think about the Obama campaign that absolutely smoked the Republicans on

123
00:07:12.281 --> 00:07:15.250
social media in 2008 campaign.

124
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.370
And then in 2016,

125
00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:22.150
president Trump realizes that he can talk directly to people.

126
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.800
And he was very comfortable with that. I don't know if George Bush ever would.

127
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.000
Sometimes I laugh and think about, um, writing a book of, um,

128
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.320
tweets, Bush would have sent by would have been

129
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.710
pretty funny, but I, um, it has changed so much.

130
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.190
Like now I will say this, I think for the country

131
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:47.860
briefings from the press secretary,

132
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.490
I always tried to turn down the temperature in the room. I thought,

133
00:07:51.491 --> 00:07:53.890
why are we fighting? I'm here to give information.

134
00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:56.950
You're here to elicit information. I always remembered too,

135
00:07:56.951 --> 00:08:00.880
that those reporters have a job to do. And part of my job as press secretary,

136
00:08:00.881 --> 00:08:05.440
I believe was protecting their right to have access to the government. And,

137
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.400
but here's the other thing.

138
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.990
I truly believe that a press briefing a daily press briefing

139
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.710
forces, a white house to have really good process,

140
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.060
because if they know that the press secretary is going to have to go out there

141
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.760
and she's going to have to answer answered these questions.

142
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.100
And that means you better call her back first,

143
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.680
if there's problems and the policy isn't settled,

144
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.780
everybody needs to get on the phone and get it done.

145
00:08:28.781 --> 00:08:31.720
And another thing I used to do was let's say I was getting,

146
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:36.850
we were at war when I was press secretary. So things are also different. Um,

147
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.510
but let's say something was happening and it was a national security issue.

148
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:44.640
And somebody within the government suggested, I say such,

149
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.980
such answer at the briefing. Well, when I did,

150
00:08:47.981 --> 00:08:52.960
because I was a reporter by training is I would double check and triple

151
00:08:52.961 --> 00:08:55.440
check. So I had my deputies and I would say, Gordon,

152
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.950
can you call the national security council? See if this is what they say,

153
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.840
Tony's going to call, um, DOD, you call the CIA,

154
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:08.640
let's meet back here in 20 minutes. And if everybody has the same answer,

155
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.580
I'll say it at the podium. And if we don't,

156
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.980
then I would go to the cheapest staff's office. And I'd say,

157
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.870
we got a problem here because everybody's not settled and we have to get this

158
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:23.490
right, because people's lives are on the line. So in that case,

159
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:25.710
I feel like forcing good process is really good,

160
00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:28.680
but everything's changed so much.

161
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.970
Who knows if it'll ever go back to being a daily press briefing,

162
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.070
