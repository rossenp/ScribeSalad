1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.010
<v 0>Sometimes these movements have to be driven by people who are true believers,</v>

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.800
because what happens is they,

3
00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:09.480
they push things all the way over and then it comes back.

4
00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:12.690
Americans are not an extreme people. We are not extreme.

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.130
Americans are not socialist. Americans are not super right wing.

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.420
Americans want a better life for their kids for the most part and are too busy

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.660
with, with, with their everyday thing.

8
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.050
I got to take my kid to baseball and I want to be able to afford afterschool

9
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:30.690
activities for my kids. That's what they really care about.

10
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.310
I want a little extra cash.

11
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.251
<v 1>I'm Dave Rubin,</v>

12
00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:41.270
and this is the Rubin report as always guys click that subscribe button and that

13
00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:42.440
little notification bell.

14
00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:46.430
So you have a small chance at least of seeing our videos and joining me today as

15
00:00:46.431 --> 00:00:51.260
a comedian and actor and co-host of the fire and the kid podcast.

16
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.880
Brian Callen. Welcome to the Rubin report. Thank you, sir. Look at fan big fan.

17
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.780
Love it. Big fan. Finally made it you're in the internet.

18
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.070
Now this is like the center of the [inaudible]. Yes

19
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.070
, this right here. Everything that we say here stays here. No one will get in

20
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.903
 any trouble here. Exactly fine.

21
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.090
<v 0>As long as you, uh, as long as you don't express yourself freely, thoughtfully,</v>

22
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:15.583
and with reason.

23
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.150
<v 1>That seems like a good place to start. Yeah. Comedy in an age of cancellation,</v>

24
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.290
how are you feeling these days?

25
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.180
<v 0>I think that it feels as though this is the last</v>

26
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.010
bastion for satire, honest expression, original self-expression,

27
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.650
you know, I've had comments comment and say, well,

28
00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:38.210
I've got the show with a certain network and I'm afraid that what I said, uh,

29
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.800
I expressed a point of view that was more complicated than some black or white,

30
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.240
no pun intended. Yeah. You know, you're going forward and should I,

31
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.410
should I do this? You,

32
00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:52.700
you have comics now wondering if they should edit themselves in podcasts.

33
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.770
And my answer is if that is, what, if you are,

34
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.540
um, worried about that because you're working for that network,

35
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.600
then you shouldn't work for that network. Then you're no longer a comic.

36
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.470
Then you're no longer in the business of original self-expression

37
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.090
thoughts.

38
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.010
And art has always been there to disturb to shake things

39
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:19.190
up. Let's take will. And grace, as an example,

40
00:02:19.191 --> 00:02:21.440
I auditioned for that show maybe five times.

41
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.920
I can't remember if it was for Jack. It was for Eric. It was for both.

42
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.850
And I knew it was going to be a hit, but it was so groundbreaking.

43
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.260
It was so astonishing.

44
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.880
It was the first time that gay people were kind of highlighted as this,

45
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.620
um, as people with senses of humor who wanted the same thing,

46
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:44.420
that straight people. I remember that being a radical new, uh,

47
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.830
idea. And it, you know, back then, you know,

48
00:02:48.831 --> 00:02:52.910
we always talk about how you can get canceled for certain words, you say, well,

49
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.280
in the, um, well,

50
00:02:55.281 --> 00:03:00.220
let's say all to all of American history up through probably nineties.

51
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.200
If you were found out to be gay in a, in the workplace, well,

52
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:07.330
if you didn't get fired, you weren't going to get promoted.

53
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.990
It was a major liability and physically dangerous.

54
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.450
So along comes will and grace and a

55
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:20.170
network took a risk. So in that sense, you know, you can,

56
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.400
you can point to examples where it's very important to continue to speak your

57
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:29.350
mind. And it's very important when the pendulum swings too far, right,

58
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:33.820
or too far left or too far in any direction as an artist, you got to push back,

59
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.630
you got to kind of go, you gotta make fun of it. And that's the one,

60
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.140
the through all this insanity. And there are a lot of bad ideas out there.

61
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.350
And there are a lot of sort of like, um, there's, we're very polarized.

62
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.060
There's no room for nuances, you know, as I'm sure you've picked up on, but, um,

63
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.470
I do think Americans have this really great safety valve, this switch,

64
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:57.370
which is humor. We tend to make fun of ourselves. We tend to make fun of,

65
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.500
of cancel culture already. We tend to make fun of, of all of these things. Uh,

66
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.210
w th th there's Trump has always being made fun of. And so is the other side.

67
00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:11.950
So I think at least we are going to always,

68
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.260
w we'll we'll always have that thing. Even kids now,

69
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:22.090
my friend's son who is 16, my, my, his, my buddy said,

70
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.380
look at that, look at that butterfly, wonder what he's gonna land on next.

71
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.240
And his friend said, dad, how are you assuming that's a, Hey, I mean,

72
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.720
how do you know? And already kids are making fun of this stuff.

73
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.240
So I think that's very healthy.

74
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.101
<v 1>But doesn't,</v>

75
00:04:38.101 --> 00:04:42.090
this seem a little unique in that there's like a runaway train aspect to her

76
00:04:42.091 --> 00:04:45.060
right now, where used to be kind of like, Oh,

77
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.680
one person randomly said one thing and they get taken out where now it just

78
00:04:49.681 --> 00:04:53.160
feels like the whole track got destroyed. The train is going off,

79
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.920
and everyone's kind of going with it at the same time.

80
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.650
<v 0>We were, if this was 1968,</v>

81
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.420
we'd be saying the same thing and we'd be even more panicked. You know? Um,

82
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.260
I think right now we're dealing with a confluence of events.

83
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.810
You're dealing with, you know, the George Floyd,

84
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.910
the terrible murder of George Florida.

85
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.510
You're dealing with COVID-19 where nobody has jobs and nobody has anywhere to go

86
00:05:15.511 --> 00:05:16.830
to. Uh,

87
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.560
and you're dealing with all these uncertainties and you're dealing with this

88
00:05:19.561 --> 00:05:24.450
incredibly polarizing figure named Donald Trump so that all of

89
00:05:24.451 --> 00:05:28.380
that stuff I think is a perfect storm. So it's when you're in it,

90
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.460
it's hard to see a way out of it. And it's hard to see sense.

91
00:05:32.461 --> 00:05:36.900
I do think again, there are a lot of bad ideas out there, and I do think that,

92
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.000
um, but again, if I'm a moderate person, I just am,

93
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.720
I'm naturally moderate, medium, uh.

94
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.650
<v 1>Your show. We were trying to figure out what we might differ on politically.</v>

95
00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:50.860
We couldn't come up with that.

96
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.690
<v 0>No, I think you're a very reasonable, I've listened to you many times and I,</v>

97
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.060
and I've listened to your guests and your, I, you know,

98
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.750
truth is you are a reasonable fair-minded person.

99
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.130
Don't tell that to the New York times. Well, you know, again, I think,

100
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.090
and, and then I, I find myself saying, you know, um,

101
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.310
sometimes these movements have to be driven by people who are true believers,

102
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.610
because what happens is they, they pushed things all the way over,

103
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:20.990
and then it comes back. Americans are not an extreme people. We are not extreme.

104
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.430
Americans are not socialist. Americans are not super right wing.

105
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.520
Americans want a better life for their kids for the most part,

106
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:32.930
and are too busy with, with, with their every day thing.

107
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.350
I gotta take my kid to baseball and I want to be able to afford afterschool

108
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:38.990
activities for my kids. That's what they really care about.

109
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.440
I want a little extra cash. I mean, if you really come down to it,

110
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.500
and I think that they, the silent majority,

111
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.300
the most they ever really do is write letters. Please. We tweet now, come on,

112
00:06:50.301 --> 00:06:54.230
you know, stuff like that. But, but, but, you know, come election time.

113
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.790
A lot of times, if, if, if they feel like their bottom line is being affected,

114
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.950
I E the way their children are being raised educated and, uh,

115
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.271
and,

116
00:07:04.271 --> 00:07:07.520
and whether or not they have a little extra cash in their pocket that that'll

117
00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:11.750
get them to the polls. Otherwise, eh, I got enough for this,

118
00:07:11.751 --> 00:07:12.830
and I got enough for that. Yeah.

119
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.380
<v 1>I want to stick with the comedy thing for a little bit,</v>

120
00:07:14.381 --> 00:07:15.640
because you mentioned how,

121
00:07:15.641 --> 00:07:19.080
if you're a comic and you're working at a network that's making you sense or

122
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.880
making you question yourself, then you're working at the wrong place. Yes.

123
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.900
Isn't it odd though, that for all of us that are now in the podcast, YouTube,

124
00:07:25.901 --> 00:07:29.890
whatever you want to call this thing that now we're watching ourselves do it to

125
00:07:29.891 --> 00:07:31.690
ourselves. We're, we're our own bosses.

126
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.030
I'm not saying you're doing it and I'm not doing it,

127
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.660
but we know a lot of people now that are getting in trouble because of what's

128
00:07:37.661 --> 00:07:40.120
being said on podcasts. And we know that, you know,

129
00:07:40.121 --> 00:07:44.530
media matters watches every word that somebody is going to say so that if,

130
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.130
you know, anybody says one thing, the wrong way that you're taking them out,

131
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.600
even though these guys own their stuff.

132
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:55.030
<v 0>Yeah. Um, but trouble, when you say getting in trouble, the truth is that,</v>

133
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:55.840
um,

134
00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.310
they're not the truth is I look at getting in trouble as not being able to earn

135
00:08:00.311 --> 00:08:02.050
a living. Uh, you know, um,

136
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.980
corporations are incredibly in many ways spineless,

137
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:10.120
and we'll get into that in a second. And what I mean by that, but, but, um,

138
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.580
I think that you're still a little bit, look,

139
00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:16.360
I I'm on stage all the time I was in Arizona. I was in Texas. Um,

140
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.700
anywhere I go, when I,

141
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:23.260
when I say things that seem reasonable when I criticize

142
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.670
the sort of, even whether it's conservatives or liberals and I,

143
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:29.350
I criticize both. People love it.

144
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.340
<v 1>People clap, people laugh because.</v>

145
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:37.330
<v 0>Uh, typically I think I always find that if I'm feeling this way,</v>

146
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.890
so as most of the country, yeah, because most people are just reasonable.

147
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.100
They're not indoctrinated into an ideology if you like.

148
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.010
<v 1>Okay. For more honest and thoughtful conversations about comedy,</v>

149
00:08:48.011 --> 00:08:50.470
