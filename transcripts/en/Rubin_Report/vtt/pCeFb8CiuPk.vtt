<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.060
<v 1>What up people. It is Tuesday,</v>

3
00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:15.950
November 17th in the year 2022 weeks

4
00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:18.710
ago. Today was election day.

5
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.380
The very election that is still not certified.

6
00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:22.550
And we don't know what the hell is going on.

7
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.480
Just think back to what your life was like two weeks ago today,

8
00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:30.530
you woke up that morning, you thought, Oh, it's all going to end tonight.

9
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.890
Maybe my guy wins. Maybe my guy loses,

10
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.720
but realistically we have a solution. We'll have an outcome to this thing.

11
00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:42.190
And we can all move on with our lives. We can be locked down again,

12
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.330
live in our basement forever.

13
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.280
And that would be that instead of everything's chaotic and psychotic.

14
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.520
And here we are, it's two weeks later, we got about six,

15
00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:56.360
seven States that are uncertified, and there's a lot of wackiness going on.

16
00:00:56.361 --> 00:00:58.790
So we're going to cover a bunch of stuff today, uh,

17
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.890
because as I've been saying to you guys for the last couple of days,

18
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.550
at some point here, the Trump people, the rubber meets the road,

19
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.130
you got to actually show the evidence. You can't just say, Oh,

20
00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:08.570
we've got some affidavits.

21
00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:13.310
We've got some rumors about dominion software and a bunch of that kind of stuff.

22
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.810
You got to actually show us something.

23
00:01:14.811 --> 00:01:18.710
And it sounds like they are actually getting close to showing something. Uh,

24
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:19.341
Trump lawyer,

25
00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:23.210
Sidney Powell has been on TV a lot and she is making it sound like she's got

26
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:25.640
some major stuff. Maybe she doesn't, maybe she does,

27
00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:26.930
but that is what it sounds like.

28
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.940
And Rudy Giuliani has been doing the same and he's sort of heading up operations

29
00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:35.840
on the election side, uh, for Trump right now. So we're going to go into that.

30
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.400
Uh, Giuliani was on Maria Bartiromo on Fox business and had some,

31
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.710
some interesting hints. And this is a guy who did fight the mafia in,

32
00:01:44.711 --> 00:01:48.230
in New York city, in the state of New York and all over New York city. And,

33
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:52.040
and actually did kinda kind of beat the mafia before he was mayor of New York.

34
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.070
People forget about that. So we're going to, uh, we're going to talk about that.

35
00:01:55.071 --> 00:02:00.020
Obviously the election update, then more lockdowns people.

36
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.700
Sure. The virus more than 99% of people survive and,

37
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.680
uh, you know, sure.

38
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.920
They keep telling us that we've got to do these things and then these things

39
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:13.210
either work or don't work, but then they just use those excuses for,

40
00:02:13.211 --> 00:02:14.840
for more and more lockdowns. Uh,

41
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.530
Michigan has come out with a graphic cause you got to do everything in graphics.

42
00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:21.860
These days, people are stupid. They can't just read things. You need graphics.

43
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.120
Michigan has a graphic that we're going to show you that, uh, it just,

44
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.170
none of it makes sense. And then finally, the great reset.

45
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.460
Have you heard about this thing?

46
00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:35.480
This is sort of like the globalist plan to change everything.

47
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.400
It's sort of been lurking in the background.

48
00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:39.620
And if you had been talking about it a year ago, people would have said,

49
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:42.470
you're Alex Jones. Well, now everyone's kind of talking about it.

50
00:02:42.471 --> 00:02:45.290
And Tucker was talking about it last night and Justin Trudeau,

51
00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:48.590
the man child prime minister of Canada, uh,

52
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.100
he brought up the great reset and sort of,

53
00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:55.850
might've kind of lifted the curtain a little too much as to what we're not

54
00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:58.310
exactly supposed to see the peons like me and you.

55
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.870
So we're going to that clip and, uh, and talk about that, uh,

56
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.050
before we get to any of it, guys, I want to talk to you about Glen pay.

57
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:08.140
I've been mentioning Glen pay to you guys and don't worry,

58
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:10.720
this is not my actual card. This is a mock-up card,

59
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:12.700
but I do have my own card in my wallet.

60
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:15.700
So don't try to zoom in and get me a glimpse pay is,

61
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.470
is really fantastic as this operates as a normal debit card,

62
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:25.180
but you can use actual gold or you can use your hard earned

63
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:25.840
cash.

64
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.590
You can jump back and forth using the app and you can pay for a cup of coffee.

65
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:30.850
I used it at Starbucks yesterday.

66
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:35.240
I actually went to Starbucks and I got a coffee. It was very fancy. Uh, I,

67
00:03:35.241 --> 00:03:38.620
as you saw last week, I went on Amazon. I got a new basketball.

68
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:43.300
I got some new sneakers and you decide whether you want to pay in gold or in

69
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:46.300
cash. You can buy gold, you can sell gold.

70
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.680
And it's really just an interesting way of getting some of your finances sort of

71
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:55.570
locked into perhaps a way that's a little closer to how you believe things

72
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:58.570
should be done because obviously we live in some strange times and if we're

73
00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:01.450
going to be paying off everyone else's college debt and everything else,

74
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:06.370
the dollar is in a bit of a weird spot. Glenn card is issued by Sutton bank,

75
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:11.230
which is a member of FDI pursuant to license from MasterCard international.

76
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.460
It's free to sign up. So go to glimpse aid.com/ruben for more information,

77
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:18.250
and to start purchasing gold today, that's Glint

78
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.030
pay.com/ruben to get your gold today. And now back to me, all right,

79
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.580
election time, here we go.

80
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.410
So Rudy Giuliani was on Maria Bartiromo yesterday on

81
00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:36.460
Fox news business. And you know, as I mentioned to you a moment ago,

82
00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:38.800
like we can talk about voting irregularities.

83
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:42.400
You can talk about the observers that couldn't get close enough.

84
00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:45.520
You can talk about the dominion voting systems and all of these things,

85
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.530
and we can talk about it and you can all,

86
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.670
we can all look back to election night again, two weeks ago tonight, uh,

87
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.800
two weeks ago today, when you know,

88
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.590
Trump was ahead in all of these States and they all stopped counting at once.

89
00:04:56.591 --> 00:05:00.070
So all of these red flags are up there, but none of that means that there was,

90
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.450
was widespread fraud.

91
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:03.940
That none of that means that the elections results weren't right,

92
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.760
but they've been hinting at all of this stuff.

93
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.210
And I think we're basically at the point in the next couple of days,

94
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.980
we're basically there where Bartiromo has to Bart a Romo where,

95
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.320
where the Trump team in effect has to show the

96
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:22.930
proof, right? Like the proof is in the pudding guys let's show the proof.

97
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.650
So let's throw to this clip. Uh, this is Giuliani on Maria.

98
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:29.860
Bartiromo on Fox business, and then we'll do a little unpacking.

99
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.460
<v 2>Do you, do you have that hardware in your possession to prove it?</v>

100
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.910
D can you prove the case without the hardware or the software?

101
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.450
We have people, um,

102
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.130
that I can't really disclose that can describe the hardware in great detail.

103
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.930
We have some of the people,

104
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.280
former government employees are government employees and others that were there

105
00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:56.880
at the creation of smart MADEC. They can describe it, they can draw it,

106
00:05:56.881 --> 00:06:00.770
they can show it. And then we have proof that I can't disclose yet. But, um,

107
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.970
I'm, I'm confident. I'm confident that yeah, go ahead.

108
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.700
And this has to be examined Maria, beyond this election,

109
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.580
which I believe will get overturned, but beyond this election,

110
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.850
this whole thing has to be investigated as a national security matter.

111
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.370
And the governors who gave contracts to this company never bothered to do any

112
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:22.850
due diligence. I mean, I can't imagine you would give a contract to a company.

113
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.290
If you went one step further and found out it's really being run by people that

114
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:28.970
are close to Maduro and Chavez.

115
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.490
I can't imagine you would do that unless you're out of your mind.

116
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.040
So you only have a few weeks already because they want to certify the state

117
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:38.450
elections early December.

118
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.280
Do you believe you will be kicked out and be heard within this timeframe?

119
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.620
Of course.

120
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.790
And I can't imagine how a state legislature can certify based upon ballads,

121
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.910
where we had no opportunity to inspect and it was done deliberately.

122
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.900
<v 1>Okay. So there's a bunch of stuff there.</v>

123
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.380
And I apologize for our little technical hiccup. Everything's under control now.

124
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.340
Um, Rudy is basically saying we have employees.

125
00:07:03.341 --> 00:07:06.400
We have insiders who are at smart Matech.

126
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.840
Now that is the company that owns dominion software.

127
00:07:10.841 --> 00:07:13.810
Those are the voting machines they're making it sound like they have people

128
00:07:13.811 --> 00:07:16.510
there that were there for the creation of it.

129
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.530
And that we are going to find out if some untoward,

130
00:07:20.531 --> 00:07:24.340
if some dishonest stuff is going on on top of the fact that he's saying we've

131
00:07:24.341 --> 00:07:25.990
got a bunch of other things,

132
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.600
and there's a lot of shady connections to all of this, so, okay.

133
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.670
We're basically there, right?

134
00:07:30.671 --> 00:07:33.460
Like everything's sort of feels like it's whittling into something.

135
00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.030
And now in the next couple of days, you got to drop it,

136
00:07:37.031 --> 00:07:39.670
basically because as Bartiromo points out, you know,

137
00:07:39.671 --> 00:07:43.540
the election results have to be certified in by,

138
00:07:43.541 --> 00:07:47.770
I think it's December 13th. Uh, otherwise then we open up a whole other,

139
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.480
a Pandora's box of stuff.

140
00:07:49.481 --> 00:07:52.690
So there's a whole series of things that are going on here.

141
00:07:52.691 --> 00:07:55.300
As I mentioned earlier, Sidney Powell, who's Trump's lawyer,

142
00:07:55.301 --> 00:07:59.800
she's been all over TV talking about major massive fraud. Now, look,

143
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:03.790
I'm not telling you that any of this stuff is true. I'm really not okay.

144
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:08.680
I don't know. Believe it or not. I don't know. Uh, but what I do know is when,

145
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.350
when mainstream media ignores these stories,

146
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.700
Rudy Giuliani say what you want about Rudy Giuliani. As I said before,

147
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.750
he was a associate attorney general in New York fought the mafia.

148
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.970
He wa um, no, he I'm sorry.

149
00:08:21.971 --> 00:08:25.630
He was associate attorney general of the United States of America that was under

150
00:08:25.631 --> 00:08:26.680
the Reagan administration,

151
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.670
but he was also a lawyer in New York state who fought the mafia.

152
00:08:30.671 --> 00:08:33.370
The guy has done a tremendous amount leading us through nine 11,

153
00:08:33.371 --> 00:08:36.940
everything else. Now he's putting his whole reputation on the line here.

154
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.680
If he believes this is legit.

155
00:08:38.681 --> 00:08:43.600
So the idea that you're going out there on television shows, and you're saying,

156
00:08:43.601 --> 00:08:46.420
we've got the stuff, we've got the stuff. Well, okay.

157
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.670
Then we're pretty close to the drop time. Uh, Sidney Powell also, um,

158
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.800
she was, I think Michael Flynn's lawyer as well.

159
00:08:53.801 --> 00:08:58.050
So these are people who have reputations and they're putting those reputations

160
00:08:58.051 --> 00:09:00.600
on the line. If the mainstream media won't cover it. I mean,

161
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:03.930
this is another one of those weird things where when the mainstream media

162
00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:06.630
doesn't cover something, that's usually when I'm like, Oh,

163
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.170
well then something actually must be going on. One of the interesting things.

164
00:09:10.171 --> 00:09:12.810
I don't know if you guys are noticing this, but right now, you know,

165
00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:15.240
this morning there was this, another big tech hearing.

166
00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:18.690
And it's just a bunch of bloviation because nobody's going to do anything.

167
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.270
They didn't do anything before the election. They're not going to do anything.

168
00:09:21.271 --> 00:09:25.080
Now, again, I like guys like Ted Cruz who are grilling the hell out of Jack,

169
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.020
but it's like, what's the purpose of all of this? You guys, absolutely.

170
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:28.831
Aren't doing anything.

171
00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:32.040
And we're potentially either ending entering this lame duck session with

172
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.930
Trumbull, or it's just, it's too late. It's too late to make anything happen.

173
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.980
Um, but one of the things that I've been noticing is when I opened my phone now,

174
00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:43.380
and you see like, you know, the latest news or whatever,

175
00:09:43.381 --> 00:09:45.180
I try to shut most of the notifications off.

176
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:46.920
But even on like the Twitter stories,

177
00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:49.320
they're much less talking about the election now,

178
00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.730
because they're really trying to say to you,

179
00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:54.510
the election is just over and I'm seeing more like pop culture nonsense,

180
00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:57.120
and a bunch of that. So they're not even giving you the, Oh,

181
00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:00.330
Giuliani is saying we got the evidence stuff. They're just,

182
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:02.400
they're just trying to ignore stuff. Uh,

183
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:04.260
and as I've been saying for a long time, and I write about,

184
00:10:04.261 --> 00:10:05.130
and don't burn this book,

185
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:09.630
one type of fake news is the stuff that the media won't touch.

186
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.280
So anyway, look, it's Tuesday, November 17th, two weeks after the election,

187
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:16.830
okay. We've had two weeks. We still don't have certified results.

188
00:10:16.831 --> 00:10:19.650
We've had all these weird things coming out. They're trying to build a case.

189
00:10:19.651 --> 00:10:21.990
You know, a lot of people are saying, well, you gotta drop that info.

190
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.840
You gotta drop that in for the second. You got it. And it's like, well,

191
00:10:24.841 --> 00:10:26.760
they're actually trying to build a case. And as I said,

192
00:10:26.761 --> 00:10:29.910
Giuliani was a prosecutor. He knows how to build a case.

193
00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.820
So you don't just keep just dropping little things, right?

194
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.600
You got to try to go for the big fish and put the whole case together before you

195
00:10:36.601 --> 00:10:39.990
present it. So I suspect that's probably what Giuliani is doing here,

196
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.200
but maybe there's nothing here and we're all being played,

197
00:10:43.201 --> 00:10:45.300
but I think it's at least worth talking about, right.

198
00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:48.480
And that's just simply not what they're going to do.

199
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.170
And I just want to add one other thing to this, which is let's throw up this,

200
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:57.230
uh, this tweet from Nancy Pelosi. This is may of 26 17.

201
00:10:57.231 --> 00:11:01.640
And what did Nancy Pelosi say in may of 2017? She said,

202
00:11:01.641 --> 00:11:05.180
and I quote on the Twitter May 16th, 2017.

203
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:10.040
Our election was hijacked. There is no question.

204
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:15.260
Congress has a duty to protect our democracy and follow the

205
00:11:15.261 --> 00:11:17.960
facts. She even used the hashtag there. So, you know,

206
00:11:17.961 --> 00:11:21.350
she's serious protect our democracy,

207
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:25.820
follow the facts. Now it turns out it was all made up.

208
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.450
The election was not hijacked. Russia did not install. Donald.

209
00:11:29.451 --> 00:11:32.030
Trump is president. We went through a sham, impeachment,

210
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.420
all of this stuff with Ukraine. It was all a load of bunk,

211
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:39.620
but who was undermining the elections? That's the speaker of the house, right?

212
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.950
That's the speaker of the house. That's the majority leader, right?

213
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:47.600
They're telling us as virtually all of the Democrats did that.

214
00:11:47.601 --> 00:11:50.420
Our election was hacked. The last time, this time,

215
00:11:50.421 --> 00:11:54.010
we're not even allowed to talk about it. And if do talk about it,

216
00:11:54.011 --> 00:11:56.200
what are they going to do? People they're going to put you on a list.

217
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.080
I'm pretty sure I'm on the list already. That's that's all right.

218
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.240
That's all right. Um, anyway,

219
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:06.160
the point is the hypocrisy no-no knows no bounds and it is

220
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:08.800
getting harder and harder. That reality war is here.

221
00:12:08.801 --> 00:12:11.500
It is getting harder and harder to figure out what is true,

222
00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:14.230
because if you're just watching stuff and they're not even telling you about it,

223
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.040
you can't even, you can't even frame what you're thinking about correctly.

224
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.320
And I'll just keep talking about it. And you know, we'll,

225
00:12:21.321 --> 00:12:25.300
we'll see what happens. Uh, but before we get to story, number two, people,

226
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:30.160
what the millions of Americans and three former us presidents have in common.

227
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:34.270
They all agree that boll and branch sheets are the softest and most comfortable,

228
00:12:34.271 --> 00:12:36.760
pure organic cotton sheets on earth,

229
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.510
boll and branch cotton is rain fed rain,

230
00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:44.560
fed that's real pesticide free and carries the highest organic certification.

231
00:12:44.561 --> 00:12:48.820
That's why it's so soft because they work with family owned mills all over the

232
00:12:48.821 --> 00:12:52.240
world to expertly weave every set of boll and branch sheets.

233
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.320
With the highest level of craftsmanship, craftsmanship, it's quality.

234
00:12:56.321 --> 00:12:59.980
You can feel the moment you open the box. I love my boll and branch sheets.

235
00:12:59.981 --> 00:13:04.420
I'm telling you guys, these things are super, super soft, and they're cool.

236
00:13:04.421 --> 00:13:06.940
You know, I'm here in LA, it's warm. They're nice. They're cool. They're light,

237
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.810
they're fluffy. And since they sell directly to you,

238
00:13:10.811 --> 00:13:14.800
boll and branch sheets start at just $160,

239
00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.850
their thousand dollar quality for a fraction of the price.

240
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.730
Plus you can sleep on them for a month. Absolutely.

241
00:13:21.731 --> 00:13:23.980

247
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:50.950
we've talked about the election legally, that takes us into COVID.

248
00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.270
That's what you have to talk about next.

249
00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:54.070
So we know that these lockdowns are coming.

250
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:58.630
I covered the ridiculous story of Gavin Newsome are a

251
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:00.610
wonderful governor here in California.

252
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:04.210
Who's going to basically a thousand dollars a plate dinner up at one of the

253
00:14:04.211 --> 00:14:08.440
fanciest restaurants in all of California with 12 people in doors. Uh,

254
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:11.440
but now he, he didn't mean to do it. And he's sorry, but you know,

255
00:14:11.441 --> 00:14:14.560
you shouldn't have Thanksgiving with grandma. Um,

256
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:18.430
so we're just seeing the ever expanding hypocrisy of our politicians,

257
00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:22.270
who they want certain rules for how you behave. But of course they don't.

258
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:27.190
I just saw a video this morning of Diane Feinstein in the Senate chamber.

259
00:14:27.191 --> 00:14:28.870
And she's walking around without a mask.

260
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.620
We've got Schumer out during the rallies when they, uh, you know,

261
00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:35.320
after the Biden, when he's out there without a mask,

262
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.050
you got Lightfoot in Chicago, she's out there without a mask.

263
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.890
These people are all ridiculous, absolute abject,

264
00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:46.150
abject hypocrites. You've got Gretchen Whitmer from Michigan.

265
00:14:46.151 --> 00:14:47.920
And we're going to talk about Michi, Michigan. Now,

266
00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:52.520
who months ago is telling people that they can't garden in their own lawns while

267
00:14:52.521 --> 00:14:55.070
she's doing birthday parties for her husband. I mean,

268
00:14:55.071 --> 00:14:58.100
these people are AB solutely ridiculous,

269
00:14:58.101 --> 00:15:02.230
and they should have no power over all of us, uh, or any of us, I should say,

270
00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:05.500
let's throw to this new image that has comes to us from Michigan.

271
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:10.000
This is the COVID-19 pause to save lives program.

272
00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.280
So, uh, here's what they're going to do.

273
00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:16.780
We are open for two household gathering, high precautions,

274
00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:21.400
meaning I guess you can have one set of people who live together in your home

275
00:15:21.401 --> 00:15:24.700
because you've got one group of people that live in your home and you can have

276
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.620
one other group of people who live in your home.

277
00:15:26.621 --> 00:15:28.870
If you had a third group of people, I guess they can shoot you.

278
00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:33.860
That's one thing you're gonna have small outdoor gatherings, 25 people. Uh,

279
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.470
and I don't know where they come up with these numbers.

280
00:15:35.471 --> 00:15:39.340
This is sort of the endless thing. So you're saying, okay, 20 people's cool.

281
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.220
30 people, as in, we're just going to say 25,

282
00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.410
but we're supposed to pretend that means anything, uh,

283
00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.840
preschool through eighth grade. That's good to go.

284
00:15:46.841 --> 00:15:49.240
And that's the local districts choice they can decide. Well,

285
00:15:49.241 --> 00:15:50.190
I do like local choice.

286
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.920
I'll give you that childcare is good to go manufacturing, construction,

287
00:15:53.921 --> 00:15:57.160
and other work that is impossible to do remotely.

288
00:15:57.161 --> 00:16:00.670
So I guess if your job is impossible to do remotely, you can't spread. COVID.

289
00:16:00.671 --> 00:16:02.950
It's incredible. So if you have a hammer and you need a whack,

290
00:16:02.951 --> 00:16:07.750
something in you can't spread COVID I haven't holding a hammer and a spreading

291
00:16:07.751 --> 00:16:11.440
COVID. Those things don't work together. Public transit is fine. Hair salons,

292
00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.320
bar, barbershops, and other personal services. Those will all be fine.

293
00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:18.820
Gyms and pools for individual exercise. So you can't spot anybody.

294
00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:21.820
We're gonna have a lot of people that are going to be bench pressing and just

295
00:16:21.821 --> 00:16:24.130
breaking their neck, because they're going to drop the, uh,

296
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:28.180
the weights on themselves. Restaurants and bars can do outdoor dining, takeout,

297
00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:31.540
or delivery. So you can't even social distance. If you,

298
00:16:31.541 --> 00:16:35.110
if you take a restaurant at 33% capacity at a third capacity,

299
00:16:35.111 --> 00:16:37.510
basically we're not even going to allow you to do that anymore.

300
00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:38.770
So we're going to destroy all the restaurants.

301
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.880
Professional sports are allowed without spectators,

302
00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.200
so professional sports.

303
00:16:44.201 --> 00:16:47.320
So that's good that the professional athletes can still make all their money,

304
00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.130
uh, apparently amateur sports or school sports. No, no, no.

305
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:52.420
We're not going to allow that.

306
00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:56.380
I guess professional athletes are more immune to COVID. That makes sense. Uh,

307
00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:58.480
parks and outdoor recreation or, okay.

308
00:16:58.481 --> 00:17:02.380
But does that include playing a sporting event at a park? Can you do,

309
00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.130
I'm not sure about that, uh, funerals. We're going to cap them at 25 people,

310
00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.550
which that makes no sense to me because you're already at the funeral home.

311
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.040
So it's like, if you're going to kill a couple of people, I mean,

312
00:17:12.041 --> 00:17:15.330
now we're saving costs because it's like, all right, we get 30 people there.

313
00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.250
Five of them dropped dead. You can just start burying people right then.

314
00:17:18.251 --> 00:17:21.130
And there I get it. The funeral home is not the cemetery, but you know,

315
00:17:21.131 --> 00:17:24.730
they have some people there that could facilitate the whole thing happening. Uh,

316
00:17:24.731 --> 00:17:27.100
and then of course health care services, that'll be fine. Now,

317
00:17:27.101 --> 00:17:29.860
here are the things that are not open. Okay. Uh,

318
00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:32.680
not open high schools for in-person learning, right?

319
00:17:32.681 --> 00:17:35.470
Because we're just going to sit all the kids at zoom where they,

320
00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:38.200
nobody can see anybody. They can put up fake avatars,

321
00:17:38.201 --> 00:17:39.850
and we're going to pretend that they're learning. Okay.

322
00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:43.540
It's just a load of bunk and nonsense. Also, please,

323
00:17:43.541 --> 00:17:48.250
people show me the numbers are high school kids spreading COVID to each

324
00:17:48.251 --> 00:17:49.890
other and getting sick in a,

325
00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.130
in a seemingly high numbers in that bus killing people,

326
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.970
or are we actually destroying our ability to teach young people? I sense,

327
00:17:56.971 --> 00:18:00.810
it's the ladder, uh, colleges and universities in-person learning. No, no, no,

328
00:18:00.811 --> 00:18:03.870
no, no. Not going to do it, not going to do it, uh,

329
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:06.180
workplaces where we're can be done from home. So that again,

330
00:18:06.181 --> 00:18:07.680
if you have a hammer, you're good to go.

331
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:10.140
But if you're just some piano at an office you're screwed,

332
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:14.280
stay home forever in your basement, uh, restaurants and bars, uh,

333
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.710
they are not open again. It's does just the indoor dining thing,

334
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.170
organized sports except professional sports.

335
00:18:19.171 --> 00:18:21.390
So I got my answer to the earlier question,

336
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:23.970
organized sports except professional sports.

337
00:18:23.971 --> 00:18:26.460
So that means if you're a professional basketball player,

338
00:18:26.461 --> 00:18:27.600
I know the NBA season's done,

339
00:18:27.601 --> 00:18:32.220
but they'd let you play on a court and you're good to go. But 10 kids,

340
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.780
even if you, you know, did a temperature check on all of them and said, okay,

341
00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.090
you kids can get out there. You're all healthy. You, you,

342
00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.520
you can play basketball now. They're not allowed to do it.

343
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.800
That that makes sense. So let's just keep them home all day, right?

344
00:18:43.801 --> 00:18:47.820
Like let's just keep them in the dark and on their computers all day long,

345
00:18:47.821 --> 00:18:50.370
that that seems better. Uh, theaters, movie, theaters,

346
00:18:50.371 --> 00:18:55.080
stadiums and arenas are all closed, goes without saying bowling centers.

347
00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:58.770
I call them a bowling alley. They call them bowling centers, ice skating, rinks,

348
00:18:58.771 --> 00:19:03.060
and indoor water parks. And that's it. None of those are going to be happening.

349
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:08.190
Bingo halls, casinos and arcades who wrote this, the, your,

350
00:19:08.191 --> 00:19:11.310
all of your local bingo halls are closed people. I do enjoy bingo,

351
00:19:11.311 --> 00:19:14.610
but it's just kind of funny that the bingo halls are closed, uh,

352
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:19.290
casinos and arcades. So, you know, if you've been waiting around for the,

353
00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:23.550
you know, the new Ms. Pac-Man, you're screwed people, uh,

354
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:26.880
and finally group fitness classes also. So it's like,

355
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:31.980
get a Peloton or, you know, you're screwed, okay. Peloton time,

356
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:35.430
because you can't go to the gym anyway,

357
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:39.180
every day we see more and more of this stuff. And I am not sitting here.

358
00:19:39.181 --> 00:19:40.440
As I've said to you guys, a million times,

359
00:19:40.441 --> 00:19:44.430
I'm not sitting here as someone that is denying that COVID is real,

360
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:48.270
but why are we trusting these people at this point, they get everything wrong.

361
00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:52.680
Two weeks to flatten the curve months, go by now. They want more restrictions.

362
00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:54.870
Gavin Newsome here in California was,

363
00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:59.670
was looking at a study from Saudi Arabia to see what curfews might do for us.

364
00:19:59.671 --> 00:20:01.950
Because I guess if you can just lock us all home at 10,

365
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.630
that somehow stops the spread.

366
00:20:03.631 --> 00:20:07.290
And I'm glad they're getting that information from Saudi Arabia. It's like,

367
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.460
we are really dealing with something that is unprecedented. And I, and I think,

368
00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.200
well, we all know that, right?

369
00:20:13.201 --> 00:20:16.530
We all know that we're dealing with something unprecedented, but it's like,

370
00:20:16.531 --> 00:20:20.400
how far can they push us? Can they say,

371
00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:24.090
we are literally going to monitor how many people you have in your house?

372
00:20:24.091 --> 00:20:25.950
How many families, quite literally,

373
00:20:25.951 --> 00:20:30.120
how many families of people you have in your house? You know, this is,

374
00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:34.740
this is the time of year rolling into Thanksgiving and into Christmas.

375
00:20:34.741 --> 00:20:36.960
This is the time when we're supposed to give thanks.

376
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.250
We're supposed to be appreciative. We're supposed to be around family. You know,

377
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.280
one of the things that social media did, it was supposed to make us social,

378
00:20:44.281 --> 00:20:47.010
but in many ways it made us more antisocial and it,

379
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:51.280
us on our phones and kept us away from people and started making us hate people.

380
00:20:51.281 --> 00:20:54.430
Instead of love people more, if there was ever a time in the world, I mean,

381
00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:57.580
really, if there was ever a time in your life where we needed a Thanksgiving,

382
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.730
doesn't it kind of feel like this is the year to do it.

383
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.090
Like this is the year where you should sit around a table with some family

384
00:21:04.091 --> 00:21:07.270
members and some friends, and maybe you agree with them on some stuff.

385
00:21:07.271 --> 00:21:10.060
And maybe you disagree with them on some stuff. And maybe you talk politics,

386
00:21:10.061 --> 00:21:13.150
but believe it or not, maybe you don't talk politics, but like,

387
00:21:13.151 --> 00:21:16.480
we actually get to break bread with, with human beings and say, boy,

388
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:20.230
we're really thankful to be here in America. Or, you know, if you,

389
00:21:20.231 --> 00:21:23.500
if you celebrate it in another country, you know, just that,

390
00:21:23.501 --> 00:21:26.200
that we're thankful for freedom and all of that stuff. Like was there,

391
00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:29.620
is there ever a year in your life that maybe it was more important than this

392
00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:33.670
year? Not in my life. I was born in 76 men a long time. Okay.

393
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:37.300
I'm no spring chicken over here. So you see my point guys, that they're,

394
00:21:37.301 --> 00:21:40.420
they're taking away all of the things that tie us together.

395
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:43.900
And then they're just keeping us online all the time. And then,

396
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.230
and then eventually they'll just start censoring the hell out of us online.

397
00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.740
And we won't even know what it will be like to see, to see another person.

398
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.300
But if we had,

399
00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:57.070
if we had true public servants that actually cared about

400
00:21:57.071 --> 00:21:59.980
us, then they would be out there every day saying,

401
00:21:59.981 --> 00:22:03.370
these are the reasons we're doing these things. Because when we did lock down,

402
00:22:03.371 --> 00:22:07.240
we saw the rate, go from this to this, and then we let it out. And, you know,

403
00:22:07.241 --> 00:22:09.280
we opened up and then we saw this happen,

404
00:22:09.281 --> 00:22:10.630
but they don't tell you any of this stuff.

405
00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:14.050
They just keep pushing and pushing and pushing. And, and by the way,

406
00:22:14.051 --> 00:22:15.730
I don't think that's some grand conspiracy.

407
00:22:15.731 --> 00:22:18.490
I think this is sort of what power is. I mean, this at a,

408
00:22:18.491 --> 00:22:23.290
at a sort of high level, like power, once it starts getting power,

409
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:27.370
it just starts spreading and growing and morphing. Right. And then it's just,

410
00:22:27.371 --> 00:22:31.540
it just takes everything and good people just sit there and they're like, Oh, I,

411
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.900
you know, I want it to have Thanksgiving with the family, but, uh, you know,

412
00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:38.260
half the family won't show up because they're afraid because they watch CNN all

413
00:22:38.261 --> 00:22:40.570
the time. And it, it ain't good people.

414
00:22:40.571 --> 00:22:43.360
We got to figure out how to deal with this thing. Um,

415
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:46.330
but this is a perfect segue into the,

416
00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:49.930
into the third story that I want to talk about because, uh, this,

417
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:52.450
this great reset, uh,

418
00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:55.120
phrase has been being bounced around on Twitter a lot.

419
00:22:55.121 --> 00:22:59.260
It's not something you're going to hear about, uh, in, in the mainstream news,

420
00:22:59.261 --> 00:23:00.400
at least yet,

421
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:04.240
you won't hear about it until they've accomplished all of their goals. Uh,

422
00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:09.190
but Justin Trudeau was being interviewed and he talked about the great reset

423
00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:13.660
in relation to COVID and lock downs and just sort of everything that's

424
00:23:13.661 --> 00:23:17.800
happening economically and every other way. So let's take a look bit.

425
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:22.020
<v 3>This pandemic has provided an opportunity for a reset.</v>

426
00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:27.120
This is our chance to accelerate our pre pandemic efforts to re-imagine economic

427
00:23:27.121 --> 00:23:31.170
systems that actually address global challenges like extreme poverty,

428
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.450
inequality, and climate change.

429
00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.740
<v 1>Um, did, did he catch that now? Obviously there's a lot more to it,</v>

430
00:23:37.741 --> 00:23:42.150
but this is a time because of COVID to accelerate our pre pandemic

431
00:23:42.151 --> 00:23:44.730
plans to change our economic.

432
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.790
Did we have those plans, pre pandemic? Does anyone remember us all?

433
00:23:52.791 --> 00:23:55.190
And what he says when he says, we, he means the world.

434
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.980
He doesn't mean Canada specifically. Yeah.

435
00:23:57.981 --> 00:23:59.900
It'll happen in Canada under that buffoon.

436
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:04.790
But what they're talking about is to literally up and the world

437
00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:08.990
systems, and he's telling you, yeah, we're using COVID as the excuse.

438
00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:12.830
So when I tell you that they want just these endless lockdowns and just to keep

439
00:24:12.831 --> 00:24:17.360
ascertain, uh, accumulating power and the rest of it, it's like,

440
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.120
this is not made up stuff. And in a weird way,

441
00:24:20.121 --> 00:24:23.720
we all feel like conspiracy theorists. But, but you're only,

442
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:28.430
you're only not a conspiracy theorist. If, if you're blind in a way,

443
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.460
right? Like I'm not saying all, like, they're just coming for, like,

444
00:24:31.461 --> 00:24:34.340
there's this group of 10 people and they're sitting there and they're smoking

445
00:24:34.341 --> 00:24:37.700
and they're discussing all this stuff, but they kind of are at the same time.

446
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.000
This, this is really nutty stuff. I mean, think about what he said,

447
00:24:41.001 --> 00:24:45.770
accelerate our pre pandemic plan to change economic

448
00:24:45.771 --> 00:24:48.470
systems. So they're telling you,

449
00:24:48.471 --> 00:24:53.390
we are using COVID to severely alter how

450
00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:55.550
the world will be after COVID.

451
00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:59.480
And then when we install Chuck Schumer's words,

452
00:24:59.481 --> 00:25:03.380
when we install Joe Biden as president, this guy with dementia,

453
00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:06.740
who's just going to bring in all of these plans. And again,

454
00:25:06.741 --> 00:25:10.250
we're already bringing critical race theory, back title nine, we're going to,

455
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:13.760
he Jew Joe Biden, they just announced they're going to have like a systemic,

456
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:18.440
they, they they're hiring like a group of systemic racist experts.

457
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:22.520
That really sounds like a thing. Systemic racism, experts like, yeah.

458
00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:25.760
They're experts in racism and they are going to put it in the system.

459
00:25:25.761 --> 00:25:28.790
That's what they're going to do. Uh, there's something weird going on here,

460
00:25:28.791 --> 00:25:29.271
but anyway,

461
00:25:29.271 --> 00:25:32.660
I didn't want to do too much on this story because I want you to Google it and

462
00:25:32.661 --> 00:25:34.130
do a little research for yourself.

463
00:25:34.131 --> 00:25:36.740
And we'll talk more about it over the next couple of days and probably the next

464
00:25:36.741 --> 00:25:37.430
couple of weeks.

465
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:41.240
And perhaps we'll be living under this new with our Rotarian regime soon enough.

466
00:25:41.241 --> 00:25:43.070
And then we won't be able to talk about it. Uh,

467
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.670
but I want you to Google the great reset, do a little research world,

468
00:25:46.671 --> 00:25:48.620
economic forum. See what you think,

469
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:53.510
see what you think and listen to what they say. That's the point like,

470
00:25:53.511 --> 00:25:56.630
he's kind of telling you, Hey, we had plans to make something go down.

471
00:25:56.631 --> 00:26:01.250
And now we got a great opportunity. Cause of COVID like, woo,

472
00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:04.370
Lordy, Lordy, all right, people, I've got to jump.

473
00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:07.640
I got a few meetings today and a bunch of interesting things happening, which,

474
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:09.530
uh, I sort of referenced yesterday,

475
00:26:09.531 --> 00:26:12.650
