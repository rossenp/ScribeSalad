00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.890
<v 0>This is a really fast,</v>

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.370
quickly growing movement among millennials.

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.670
Something like 10% identify as a third gender.

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.330
So that's a lot of people and I would be totally on board with people

5
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:13.530
identifying however they want.

6
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:16.830
If it didn't also include things like medical interventions,

7
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.180
like double mastectomies, taking testosterone, testosterone, a lot of cases.

8
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.470
And in a lot of the cases,

9
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.690
I think these are just young gay people who are struggling with that.

10
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.720
<v 1>Do you think it's starting the sort of hysterical nature of this,</v>

11
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.950
of what you just described?

12
00:00:36.951 --> 00:00:40.130
Like you have to be attracted to me if this and all of those things,

13
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.060
do you think it's starting to backfire on them? Because I think most people,

14
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.990
even, even conservatives that sort of, as you alluded to earlier, they don't,

15
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.780
they don't sort of love talking about these topics.

16
00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:53.840
I don't know a lot of conservatives that don't want trans people.

17
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.600
I don't know any conservatives actually that don't want trans people to be

18
00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:59.270
treated equally under the law or something or something like that.

19
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.950
But I do sense that there's a real backlash now where the movement has gone so

20
00:01:03.951 --> 00:01:07.790
far that people are just like, you know what, forget this whole thing.

21
00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:11.110
Like the whole thing is evil. And that's what I'm worried about because when,

22
00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:15.140
when we group these letters together, um, I can,

23
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.870
I can sort of understand the people that are frustrated like that.

24
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.850
<v 0>I could see that what we're really concerns me is where we are going to be</v>

25
00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:23.211
going,

26
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:26.870
what the next step is going to be in terms of what the outcome is going to be.

27
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.650
And so we're seeing also this growing trend of nonbinary people identifying as

28
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.650
nonbinary. And again, that can be for some people,

29
00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:36.440
a way of coping with the fact that they are gay or lesbian,

30
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.850
and they are not yet able to accept that about themselves or because it is

31
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:45.110
easier to not identify as gay in society because there is still homophobia.

32
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.820
And so again.

33
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.820
<v 1>What non-binary is just for, for someone that might not know.</v>

34
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.710
<v 0>Yeah. So it's people who identify as a third gender.</v>

35
00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:58.610
So they may say they're both genders or neither. And so non binary,

36
00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:01.490
gender fluid, gender neutral, gender,

37
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.720
even though is considered by some peoples to be a slur against gay people.

38
00:02:05.721 --> 00:02:09.260
I don't tend to like to use the word. Um, so yeah,

39
00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:11.720
so this is a really fast,

40
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.200
quickly growing movement among millennials.

41
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.500
Something like 10% identify as a third gender.

42
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.160
So that's a lot of people and I would be totally on board with people

43
00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:23.390
identifying however they want.

44
00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:26.660
If it didn't also include things like medical interventions,

45
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.010
like double mastectomies taking testosterone's testosterone, a lot of cases.

46
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.300
And in a lot of the cases,

47
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.520
I think these are just young gay people who are struggling with that

48
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.330
and we should offer them support instead of having them undergo these

49
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.373
interventions.

50
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.930
<v 1>Right? So that's what I think is so interesting about this,</v>

51
00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:48.800
because I think the average person wants most people to live and let live.

52
00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.960
And however you identify, that's fine.

53
00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:54.530
As long as you're not forcing someone to do something, I think what,

54
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.890
what happens then is this next version where it's like, you can be,

55
00:02:57.891 --> 00:03:01.780
you can say you're non and if you feel that way, then so be it.

56
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:05.680
But what happens is then they won't let you accept biology.

57
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.930
So now it seems like this is now in direct conflict with biology.

58
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.080
And I think a lot of people are sort of, they're like, no,

59
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:17.580
that's the last line here that we're, we're just not going to give on you.

60
00:03:17.581 --> 00:03:18.550
Do you think that's fair to say.

61
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.000
<v 0>Right? And again, I like you.</v>

62
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.180
I have no issue with people how they want to identify. Just don't tell me that.

63
00:03:24.181 --> 00:03:26.220
That's what the scientific research shows,

64
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.660
because when you start denying science that doesn't help anyone and the truth is

65
00:03:30.661 --> 00:03:33.210
eventually going to come out. So with regards to gender,

66
00:03:33.211 --> 00:03:37.980
gender is binary because for 99% of us, our gender is our biological sex.

67
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.890
Of course there are intersex people and there are trans people for whom this

68
00:03:40.891 --> 00:03:42.360
doesn't necessarily apply,

69
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.730
but that's not to say that gender is a spectrum or that it's however you

70
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.860
want it. You don't, you don't choose your gender. You know,

71
00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:51.570
this is what they're teaching an education now that,

72
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.060
that people choose their gender.

73
00:03:54.061 --> 00:03:57.600
And I think it's really harmful to put all this misinformation out there,

74
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.570
especially in the case of someone who is identifying this way,

75
00:04:00.571 --> 00:04:03.960
for reasons that may come from, you know, their own internal struggles,

76
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.110
maybe they have other mental health issues. And they're not,

77
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.520
we're not being able to talk about that.

78
00:04:08.521 --> 00:04:12.780
I think if we could have the conversation and someone could say, yes,

79
00:04:12.781 --> 00:04:14.280
I've considered all these things,

80
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.220
but I still feel I would like to have a double mastectomy.

81
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.110
And that would be better for me,

82
00:04:19.111 --> 00:04:22.350
even though a lot of these individuals are really young when they're doing this,

83
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.510
then I wouldn't have so much of a problem,

84
00:04:24.511 --> 00:04:27.000
but we can't even have the conversation. If you've been trying to bring it up,

85
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.150
it's considered hateful even to say that there are two genders is considered

86
00:04:30.151 --> 00:04:30.990
transphobic now.

87
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.710
<v 1>Right? So what, so, all right.</v>

88
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.550
Some people watching this are going to clip it and show say that you're

89
00:04:38.551 --> 00:04:41.820
transphobic and I'm a self hating gay and all, all the usual stuff.

90
00:04:41.821 --> 00:04:45.210
So to counter that, and you write about this in the book, it,

91
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.350
can you just sort of give me the, the roadmap, if there was a young person,

92
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.400
six years old, that really felt that, you know, they were,

93
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.500
they were physically a boy, but they identified as a girl.

94
00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.450
What do you think a healthy roadmap would be as opposed to the unhealthy

95
00:05:00.451 --> 00:05:01.800
roadmap that you're talking about?

96
00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:04.740
That's just transitioning them at such a younger age.

97
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.170
<v 0>I would say to the parents, especially just to love your child unconditionally,</v>

98
00:05:10.171 --> 00:05:13.710
it doesn't matter what toys they want to play with, what they want to dress,

99
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.980
how they want to dress, who their friends are, anything like that. Let,

100
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.730
if this little boy wants to wear makeup and dresses and play with his

101
00:05:20.731 --> 00:05:23.340
girlfriends, and that should be totally fine. And conversely,

102
00:05:23.341 --> 00:05:26.340
if you have a little boy who is male, typical, I think that's also fine.

103
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.340
I think among, especially woke parents,

104
00:05:29.341 --> 00:05:32.070
they don't want their children to be gender typical nowadays,

105
00:05:32.071 --> 00:05:35.730
which is just so bizarre. So it's,

106
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.700
it's like the inverse of what it used to be that parents didn't want their kids

107
00:05:38.701 --> 00:05:39.990
playing with gender atypical toys,

108
00:05:39.991 --> 00:05:41.850
because they're afraid their kids are gonna grow up to be gay.

109
00:05:41.851 --> 00:05:44.730
And now it's that they don't want them playing with gender typical toys because

110
00:05:44.731 --> 00:05:48.710
they think that's going to limit their growth as an adult. So yeah,

111
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.470
just leave him alone. And if he says he wants to be the opposite sex,

112
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.720
see how he feels up your body.

113
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.520
<v 1>Right. So then what, what is, what does that look like? So now, okay,</v>

114
00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:00.470
so the child, they, they love them. They,

115
00:06:00.471 --> 00:06:03.200
they let them play with whatever they want, be friends with whatever,

116
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.690
whoever they want to wear, whatever they want, et cetera. Now,

117
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:08.540
now puberty comes along then, then where are you at?

118
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.180
<v 0>Well, what would normally happen? Saving?</v>

119
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.660
What's been documented in the research.

120
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.820
Literature is children who are gender dysphoric.

121
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.090
Once they start having crushes on their peers,

122
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.080
once they start growing into their bodies, a lot of them realize, Oh,

123
00:06:23.081 --> 00:06:26.500
this is actually pretty great. I like my body. And I'm happy.

124
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.560
The ones who remain dysphoric and persist,

125
00:06:29.561 --> 00:06:33.010
I would recommend seeing a mental health professional, or even,

126
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.940
even prior to that point, if,

127
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.390
if the child's gender dysphoria is quite severe and debilitating.

128
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.930
The issue though, is that nowadays the vast,

129
00:06:40.931 --> 00:06:44.890
vast majority of mental health professionals who work with gender dysphoric

130
00:06:44.891 --> 00:06:48.220
children and even gender dysphoric adults are,

131
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.890
I don't want to say that they're compromised,

132
00:06:50.891 --> 00:06:54.520
but definitely ideologies playing a huge role in terms of how they practice,

133
00:06:54.521 --> 00:06:59.170
because they cannot by law say anything other

134
00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:00.760
than, yes, if you want to transition,

135
00:07:00.761 --> 00:07:03.490
I'll help you I'll help to facilitate this because they're going to be accused

136
00:07:03.491 --> 00:07:06.220
then of commit of practicing conversion therapy.

137
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.300
Even though conversion therapy for gender identity does not exist.

138
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.310
There there's a difference between conversion therapy for sexual orientation,

139
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.970
which is, was we talked about last time is not effective. It should not be done.

140
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.450
There's no such thing as conversion therapy for a gender identity because young

141
00:07:19.451 --> 00:07:22.360
children who identify as the opposite sex again,

142
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.480
their gender is I don't use the word fluid,

143
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.210
but it's more flexible because they haven't fully developed yet.

144
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.420
So with development, they're more likely to feel differently.

145
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.720
<v 1>Right. All right. So wait, just to completely clear that up.</v>

146
00:07:34.721 --> 00:07:37.900
And we did go into the first part or the second part, uh, last time.

147
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.230
So gender or conversion therapy for gay people, meaning to take, uh,

148
00:07:42.231 --> 00:07:46.930
a young gay boy and to do whatever version of conversion therapy there is.

149
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.380
Uh, there's just no evidence that, that actually works.

150
00:07:50.381 --> 00:07:52.180
What you're saying here is if a,

151
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.290
if a therapist was dealing with a young person who identified as the other

152
00:07:56.291 --> 00:07:58.360
gender, that in essence,

153
00:07:58.361 --> 00:08:02.510
they sort of have to go with it because what,

154
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:05.590
what is it that they would lose their license or, or is there,

155
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.250
cause it's not conversion at that point at some level, right? Like what, what,

156
00:08:09.251 --> 00:08:13.270
what, or, or you think it's just the pressure of being a therapist that they'll,

157
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.313
they'll be ostracized.

158
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.310
<v 0>It's the climate it's that other professionals will ostracize them.</v>

159
00:08:18.311 --> 00:08:21.400
It's because they do run the risk of then losing their license because

160
00:08:21.401 --> 00:08:23.200
organizations will come after them and say,

161
00:08:23.201 --> 00:08:26.290
you are not practicing according to what the standards are supposed to be,

162
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:30.100
that you also have activists coming after them trying to ruin their reputation

163
00:08:30.101 --> 00:08:30.940
and their livelihood.

164
