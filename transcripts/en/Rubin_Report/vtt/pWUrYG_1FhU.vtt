1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
<v 0>So what does happening in the knitting world at least is these people are not</v>

2
00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:05.430
just leaving nasty comments on people's images.

3
00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:09.090
They're actually going after their businesses. So what they do is first off,

4
00:00:09.091 --> 00:00:11.460
they pick out high profile people to go after,

5
00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:14.430
because you don't want to just go after like Susie Q with like two followers.

6
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:15.930
You're not going to make an impact that way.

7
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.780
So they go after people that are influencers in the knitting world,

8
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:23.100
and then what they do is they direct message all of the major knitwear

9
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.920
designers or knitting stores. And they basically say,

10
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.300
if you do not denounce these people, we are going to come after you too.

11
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.000
<v 1>Do you sense that we'll get to a whole new way of looking at,</v>

12
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.420
I think not only just looking at the world as a general idea,

13
00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:50.630
but we're looking at work that people are going to realize they can telecommute

14
00:00:50.631 --> 00:00:54.890
and work from home and maybe spend more time with their spouses and maybe don't

15
00:00:54.891 --> 00:00:57.350
want to be on the road two hours a day,

16
00:00:57.351 --> 00:00:59.480
getting to work and commuting and the rest of it.

17
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:01.850
<v 0>Well, I think it's going to have to,</v>

18
00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:05.420
because so many organizations now have staffs that are completely work at home.

19
00:01:05.421 --> 00:01:06.590
And a lot of them kind of went there,

20
00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:08.600
kicking and screaming and they got pushed off the cliff.

21
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.290
Now their staff is seeing, well, we can make this work and we don't necessarily,

22
00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:13.730
always need to be in the office.

23
00:01:13.731 --> 00:01:16.610
And so it's going to have to change the relationship. I think it's,

24
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.421
it's really funny.

25
00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:20.120
I'm actually working with a group of managers right now who are transitioning

26
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:24.260
their teams to working virtually that almost have to go back to basics and it's,

27
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.060
they just,

28
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.220
they have to like build their workspaces and teach their teams how to,

29
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:31.490
how to turn in these virtual environments. But once they get there,

30
00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:32.630
they're going to be okay.

31
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.400
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.320
You think most people actually are better left to their own devices or do

33
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:41.390
you think because we're social creatures. We,

34
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.160
a lot of us need to actually show up somewhere and put on different clothes and,

35
00:01:46.161 --> 00:01:49.790
you know, behave differently with other coworkers and things like that.

36
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.570
<v 0>Yeah. I think it's, it's a little bit of both, to be honest,</v>

37
00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:55.400
we still need those social interactions,

38
00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:59.180
but also one of the keys to working at home well is to have a routine to get up,

39
00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:01.490
to take a shower, not sit around in your PJ's all day,

40
00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:03.980
have a dedicated workspace. And so that,

41
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:06.860
and that's part of what's going to help people maintain work-life balance and

42
00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:10.460
really be able to focus their energy on the things that matter. And so, um,

43
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.120
I think, you know,

44
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.880
people that people are figuring it out and working from home is weird. I mean,

45
00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:16.730
you know, this it's like sometimes you, you forget to eat.

46
00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:18.500
Sometimes you forget what time it is.

47
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:20.390
You forget to stop working at five o'clock.

48
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.760
And so people are having to tackle that as well.

49
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.980
<v 1>Yeah. When I was writing my book, I would go into our, our green room here,</v>

50
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:28.820
which is a bedroom.

51
00:02:28.821 --> 00:02:32.450
And I would just start at about seven 30 or 8:00 AM and I'd be writing, writing,

52
00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:34.670
writing, and then it would literally be 2:00 PM.

53
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.900
And David would basically slide a plate of food through the door.

54
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.370
He would open up the door, slide it in,

55
00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:44.300
not even bother me cause I would legitimately forget to eat because I was so

56
00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:45.350
just in that zone.

57
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.070
<v 0>Oh the same one. I, in my book, I was up here one,</v>

58
00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:52.190
2:00 AM in the morning and then I would go downstairs. My husband would be like,

59
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.380
what the heck happened to you? Where did you go?

60
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.780
And it's just the way it is when you get into that flow of work.

61
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.660
<v 1>Yeah. All right. So a psychologist and, uh,</v>

62
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.390
you're doing some interesting stuff that obviously is very relevant as we're

63
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:07.420
talking about to, to the way we're all living right now. Uh,

64
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.600
but what sort of put you on the map here was this piece that you wrote, uh,

65
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:11.890
that all started well,

66
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:15.670
you were part of a knitting community and we can all imagine how radical the

67
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:17.290
knitting communities are. Uh,

68
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.930
tell me a little bit about the knitting communities online.

69
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:22.180
I'm not in the knitting world. I don't know what's going on over there.

70
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.080
I have respect for the knitters, but uh, tell me about the knitting community.

71
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.421
<v 0>Oh day,</v>

72
00:03:27.421 --> 00:03:32.370
prepare to have your mind blown what's going on in the world because this

73
00:03:32.371 --> 00:03:36.000
all started about a year ago and in the knitting community I'm talking about,

74
00:03:36.001 --> 00:03:38.340
this is not a knitting circle of little old ladies.

75
00:03:38.341 --> 00:03:40.650
This is mostly people of all different ages,

76
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.070
Instagram kind of sharing their projects and sharing their yards and all these

77
00:03:44.071 --> 00:03:46.050
things well about a year ago,

78
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.040
these roving gains of social justice warriors started infiltrating different

79
00:03:50.041 --> 00:03:53.850
parts of the knitting community and really started going after and bullying and

80
00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:56.070
mobbing people very severely.

81
00:03:56.071 --> 00:04:00.900
So it started with a woman named Karen Templar who wrote a blog post about her

82
00:04:00.901 --> 00:04:02.100
upcoming trip to India.

83
00:04:02.101 --> 00:04:05.520
And she was so excited about going on this trip and it just,

84
00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:06.600
she thought it would never happen.

85
00:04:06.601 --> 00:04:11.370
And she was always scared to travel and all these things and the SJWs

86
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.220
monitor so badly because they said you're othering them.

87
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.920
You're you're calling saying all this stuff, how dare you.

88
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.780
And she had to write this full retraction and apology and point out every

89
00:04:21.781 --> 00:04:24.750
single thing that was wrong with her blog posts. It was,

90
00:04:24.751 --> 00:04:26.760
and it's several paragraphs long. It's crazy.

91
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.160
So the another woman Maria Tuscan was watching that and she does these beautiful

92
00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:37.110
hand dyed yarns. And all Maria did was post a video on YouTube saying,

93
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.430
I'm not comfortable with what's going on and I'm going to take some time off of

94
00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:44.250
Instagram. Well, they didn't like that. And they,

95
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.100
they went after her and mocked, her tried to destroy her business,

96
00:04:47.101 --> 00:04:48.780
destroy all her partnerships,

97
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.210
but we'd post horrible pictures of her on Instagram,

98
00:04:51.211 --> 00:04:55.920
like photo-shopped into in uniforms and things like that. And so that was crazy.

99
00:04:55.921 --> 00:04:59.580
But the thing that really got my attention was this one guy, Nathan Taylor,

100
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.980
he goes by the name sock petition on Instagram.

101
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.780
And all he did when all of this was going on was to post a poem

102
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.470
on a hashtag called diversity, asking for kindness,

103
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.420
asking for people to be nice to each other and for his, Oh,

104
00:05:15.421 --> 00:05:18.720
I know. And, and you know, I mean, and the ironic thing about him too, is like,

105
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.550
it's a gay man in the knitting community.

106
00:05:20.551 --> 00:05:24.060
So he's like that a couple of minority cars in this instance, working for him.

107
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:25.950
But for his efforts,

108
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.360
he was thanked by being mobbed by hundreds and hundreds of people to the point

109
00:05:30.361 --> 00:05:34.800
where he had a nervous breakdown and went into the hospital on suicide watch.

110
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.700
And I'm kind of watching all this happen. And like I said,

111
00:05:38.701 --> 00:05:41.160
my background is in workplace bullying. I've studied adults,

112
00:05:41.161 --> 00:05:43.620
bullying other adults extensively. And I just thought,

113
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.810
this is not what I signed up for.

114
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.220
And these are people that I was aligned with politically. And it really,

115
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.050
if that was my wake-up moment to say,

116
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.490
what is going on in the world and do I want to really be a part of this?

117
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.190
Okay.

118
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.790
<v 1>So there's, there's a lot there, but the,</v>

119
00:06:00.791 --> 00:06:05.780
the sort of bones of your story is the type of story that I hear all the time.

120
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:09.440
I've had many of my guests I've been through my own version of it that,

121
00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:10.550
you know, you're basically,

122
00:06:10.551 --> 00:06:14.180
I think you can describe your own political positions, but you know,

123
00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:16.370
you think of yourself as sort of a good lefty. You're knitting.

124
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:18.590
This is sort of a political, next thing, you know,

125
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:22.700
some bizarre thing happens and everyone's a racist and a bigot and we're

126
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:24.050
destroying lives and all that.

127
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.900
Did you have no sense that any of this was going on within the community or you

128
00:06:29.901 --> 00:06:34.100
actually use the word infiltrated where these outsiders that were coming in to

129
00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:38.600
suddenly wreck havoc or were these people from within the community themselves?

130
00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:42.440
And I ask you this because a lot of people these days are now we're spending

131
00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:44.270
more and more time online. Uh,

132
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:47.810
one of the things that I'm trying to do with my new tech company,

133
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.180
locals.com is create protected communities.

134
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.530
And people are trying to figure out how can you gate a community and make sure

135
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:57.650
that all these bad actors, uh, you know, don't get in there?

136
00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:58.871
<v 0>No,</v>

137
00:06:58.871 --> 00:07:02.500
I think a lot of them were actually part of the knitting community and all of

138
00:07:02.501 --> 00:07:04.690
this too, was surrounding the site Ravelry,

139
00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:07.720
which is one of the most popular netting sites, uh, on the internet.

140
00:07:07.721 --> 00:07:12.040
And what Ravelry did I think midway through last year is they banned all support

141
00:07:12.041 --> 00:07:12.874
for Donald Trump.

142
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.670
So you were not allowed to say anything in the forums about supporting him.

143
00:07:15.671 --> 00:07:18.190
You were not allowed to post patterns with like Trump 20, 20,

144
00:07:18.191 --> 00:07:21.720
or anything like that. And that fed into all of this as well. So what,

145
00:07:21.721 --> 00:07:25.630
what would happen is they would like coordinate on Ravelry and then they would

146
00:07:25.631 --> 00:07:28.390
go forth and bullied people on Instagram. I think.

147
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:33.190
<v 1>So what were the types of things that you were seeing besides just, Oh,</v>

148
00:07:33.191 --> 00:07:35.410
you're evil, you're racist, you're a bigot.

149
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.380
Like they were actually trying to go for people's jobs. And as you said, I mean,

150
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.500
at least one guy had a mental breakdown because of it.

151
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:42.880
But can you talk about that?

152
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.330
Cause I think a lot of times people that don't pay that much attention to this

153
00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:47.860
stuff, they're always like, Oh, well,

154
00:07:47.861 --> 00:07:51.790
it's just some trolls on Twitter and there's no real world consequences.

155
00:07:51.791 --> 00:07:52.624
You know.

156
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:56.620
<v 0>It's what is happening in the knitting world at least is these people are not</v>

157
00:07:56.621 --> 00:07:58.930
just leaving nasty comments on people's images.

158
00:07:58.931 --> 00:08:02.590
They're actually going after their businesses. So what they do is first off,

159
00:08:02.591 --> 00:08:04.960
they pick out high profile people to go after,

160
00:08:04.961 --> 00:08:07.930
because you don't want to just go after like Susie Q with like two followers.

161
00:08:07.931 --> 00:08:09.430
You're not going to make an impact that way.

162
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.280
So they go after people that are influencers in the knitting world,

163
00:08:12.281 --> 00:08:16.600
and then what they do is they direct message all of the major knitwear

164
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.420
designers or knitting stores. And they basically say,

165
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.860
if you do not denounce these people, we are going to come after you too.

166
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.580
And so there are very detrimental effects on people's businesses. And this is,

167
00:08:27.581 --> 00:08:31.240
this is what their livelihood is. And knitting, you know, like spoiler alert,

168
00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:34.240
Dave knitting is not like a lucrative business. Right.

169
00:08:34.241 --> 00:08:36.460
And so when we're talking about going,

170
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.980
Oh, mean I don't make my money from knitting, but no, I mean, they're,

171
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.920
they're doing what they need to do to get by. And so it really does have, uh,

172
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:46.450
a horrible impact.

173
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:52.660
<v 1>Okay. So what's interesting about this because this is sort of a world,</v>

174
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.860
it's a very niche world that a lot of people don't understand about it,

175
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.920
but politically now you mentioned the Trump thing already that they,

176
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.830
one of the sites said, okay, no more pro Trump stuff,

177
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:06.540
you can't knit a Trump sweater or anything like that. But politically speaking,

178
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:11.070
this is a pretty female dominated lefty basically, right.

179
00:09:11.071 --> 00:09:15.540
Lefty, uh, ideologically dominated arena.

180
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.940
So were you shocked? I mean,

181
00:09:17.941 --> 00:09:21.840
these are the people that are supposed to be tolerant and diverse and open and

182
00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:24.630
all of those things and you considered yourself one of them,

183
00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:27.630
at least at the time, uh, were you shocked?

184
00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:29.670
And then how did that then lead to,

185
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.520
I think what you would now consider your political awakening?

186
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.610
<v 0>Yeah, so it was very shocking to me that this was not what I perceived, the,</v>

187
00:09:37.611 --> 00:09:41.030
the good, the good tolerant liberals to be doing. And, you know,

188
00:09:41.031 --> 00:09:44.120
I frankly hadn't been paying attention to a lot of this stuff that was going on

189
00:09:44.121 --> 00:09:45.980
in the world. I was busy. I was living my life.

190
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.500
And so to see how this played out,

191
00:09:48.501 --> 00:09:53.060
it really did make me question everything about my belief system and the people

192
00:09:53.061 --> 00:09:54.290
I had aligned myself with.

193
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:59.060
<v 1>Yeah. Can you just go through a little bit of what your political leanings were</v>

194
00:09:59.061 --> 00:09:59.894
beforehand?

195
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.410
<v 0>Yeah. I've, I've called myself a liberal for like 20 years.</v>

196
00:10:03.411 --> 00:10:06.800
I've been a Democrat since I was 18 years old since I was able to register to

197
00:10:06.801 --> 00:10:07.790
vote. And frankly,

198
00:10:07.791 --> 00:10:12.020
I never really saw myself leaving the democratic party up until all this started

199
00:10:12.021 --> 00:10:12.854
happening.

200
00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.820
<v 1>More honest and thoughtful conversations about politics instead of nonstop</v>

00:10:16.821 --> 00:10:19.130
