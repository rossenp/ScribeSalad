00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.380
<v 0>I was talking to him on the phone with my brother.</v>

2
00:00:01.381 --> 00:00:05.280
Who's a stationed in Fort Bragg and they have a 9:00 PM curfew.

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.950
What on earth is a 9:00 PM curfew doing to stop the spread of a pandemic bars

4
00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:15.690
are already closed. This doesn't make any sense. This is just something for,

5
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.583
for,

6
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.160
for simple minded people to express how much they did to,

7
00:00:21.161 --> 00:00:22.530
to combat the pandemic.

8
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:25.830
You didn't do anything you infringed on people's freedoms for no reason.

9
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.310
You have to have a good reason for implementing the restrictions that people are

10
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:30.144
going to implement.

11
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.050
<v 2>Move on from Corona though. And I want to obviously talk about the book.</v>

12
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.090
You mentioned the stimulus before,

13
00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:47.930
and can you just talk a little bit about what that process is like and when you

14
00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:51.530
suddenly see everybody on every side, although in this case,

15
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:53.210
I think the most egregious examples were,

16
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.740
were by the progressive about just all the pork they stuff in there and all

17
00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:02.030
these things that have nothing to do with helping the economy because of

18
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.670
coronavirus. And then it helped, you know, it's things like, you know,

19
00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:08.720
Nancy Pelosi happens to be on the board of the Kennedy arts center.

20
00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:12.530
And like all of these things that we all know are terrible. And when,

21
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:15.800
when limited government people see those things, it's like, man,

22
00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:19.760
if you guys can't even help us now, if you can't even do it right now,

23
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.320
then even the little bit of the limited part starts to become really freaking

24
00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:25.154
irrelevant, you know?

25
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.320
<v 0>Yeah. As far as the process on this particular bill and unfortunately,</v>

26
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:34.700
a lot of bills that it is a closed group of, of leadership, that's,

27
00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:39.050
that's doing that. Um, and that's for the sake of expediency, uh,

28
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.650
you, it doesn't mean people don't have a say there's,

29
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.660
there's a constant conversation of, and ways to get input into there.

30
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.410
Of course it's hard to put input into a bill if you're not really sure how the

31
00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:55.340
bill is, is being formed anyway. Um,

32
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.390
our leadership does a pretty decent job of keeping us informed in a private way.

33
00:01:59.391 --> 00:02:03.500
So like maybe it's maybe it's conference calls or whatever it is so that we can

34
00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:06.950
say, hold on, we're not in favor of this. Just like I was outspoken against,

35
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.400
you know, direct cash payments. I don't think that made any sense, uh,

36
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.570
for a lot of reasons. Um, and, uh, and the,

37
00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:15.710
in the same way Progressive's,

38
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.150
and some more populous conservative against any kind of, uh, help to big,

39
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.060
to big businesses at all, if it's just loans.

40
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.530
And so people still get their voice heard on that. Um, so,

41
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.210
but the reality is, is yes, a lot of this is negotiated, um,

42
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.210
and in closed door sessions. Uh,

43
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.920
and I'm not so sure that's the wrong way because you know, you,

44
00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:42.710
you could debate it publicly on the house floor, I suppose,

45
00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:45.020
but where would we get and how long would that take when,

46
00:02:45.021 --> 00:02:47.780
when this is an emergency? Um, you know,

47
00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:52.490
so that that's whether that's good or bad is I think truly up for

48
00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:56.720
debate as far as the pork goes. Um, yeah, it's frustrating. Um,

49
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.210
you didn't see me making a huge fuss about it. Um,

50
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.230
mostly because we're talking about millions of dollars when we passed a $2

51
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.140
trillion stimulus package. So, you know, I,

52
00:03:07.141 --> 00:03:10.990
I try to look at everything through a lens of perspective and also, um,

53
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.490
you know, I try to, I try to interpret the best of intentions from,

54
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.640
from the people who wanted that in there, which was these,

55
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.400
these particular organizations, like the Kennedy center,

56
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.550
they will shed jobs if we don't fund them because they,

57
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.740
they make their money off of events. Um,

58
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.780
now the frustrating part for everybody was they still shed jobs like many

59
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.120
businesses later, like many businesses, are I just, this,

60
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:38.650
this isn't something that like made me angry, you know? And I, he says,

61
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:42.940
I just wrote a whole book about not engaging in an outrage and,

62
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:46.150
and having some perspective and, and looking a few layers deep into,

63
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.580
into why something happened as,

64
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.580
as a method to sort of temper your own emotions. Um, so, you know, it's,

65
00:03:53.581 --> 00:03:57.280
it's generally hard to get me emotionally upset and I don't understand it from

66
00:03:57.281 --> 00:04:01.360
either side of the aisle, frankly, when people get emotional about things. Um,

67
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.000
it doesn't mean they're wrong to, to, to show concern,

68
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:05.320
but I wouldn't let it keep you up at night.

69
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.250
<v 2>Yeah. All right. So just one more on this then. Um,</v>

70
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.010
what else should the government be doing right now? I mean,

71
00:04:11.011 --> 00:04:12.960
we're all still in lockdown. You know,

72
00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:17.910
yesterday I went to my local hardware store and I saw that I could buy seeds to

73
00:04:17.911 --> 00:04:20.970
plant some things, which I did buy, but I know that in Michigan,

74
00:04:20.971 --> 00:04:23.220
you actually can't buy seeds right now. I mean,

75
00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:27.120
we've got a series of kind of crazy things and I'm all, I'm all for the,

76
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.610
the governors and the States doing what they want.

77
00:04:29.611 --> 00:04:33.450
I think you mostly are as well. Uh, but there are some strange things happening,

78
00:04:33.451 --> 00:04:37.320
but what do you think the role of the federal government and the States should

79
00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:41.040
be right now? And are, are they basically working together pretty well?

80
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.330
<v 0>Yeah, I think the balance is about right. I think every once in awhile,</v>

81
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.210
even the president says kind of the wrong thing about, you know,

82
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.990
whether he's talking about forcing every opening or forcing a national lockdown,

83
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.920
neither is okay, you can't do it. Um, that that's up to the States.

84
00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.000
And in States like Michigan, where the governor is making up stupid rules, uh,

85
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.750
they should be held accountable, but I hope voters are holding. I think it's a,

86
00:05:03.751 --> 00:05:08.730
her right deeply accountable for these completely foolish

87
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.400
policies that are really just based in virtue, signaling,

88
00:05:11.401 --> 00:05:16.290
not based in any actual, uh, E even even two seconds of,

89
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.900
of logical thought. It's like, what, you know,

90
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.580
I was talking to him on the phone with my brother.

91
00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:24.510
Who's a stationed in Fort Bragg and they have a 9:00 PM curfew.

92
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.180
What on earth is a 9:00 PM curfew doing to stop the spread of a pandemic bars

93
00:05:30.181 --> 00:05:34.920
are already closed. This doesn't make any sense. This is just something for,

94
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:35.813
for,

95
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.360
for simple minded people to express how much they did to,

96
00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:41.730
to combat the pandemic.

97
00:05:41.731 --> 00:05:45.060
You didn't do anything you infringed on people's freedoms for no reason.

98
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.540
You have to have a good reason for implementing the restrictions that people are

99
00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:52.530
going to implement. Okay. So, so what's next. And to your question, uh,

100
00:05:52.531 --> 00:05:55.680
what's next is we have to start having a real conversation about how to reopen

101
00:05:55.681 --> 00:05:56.940
the economy, uh,

102
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.670
alongside battling and reducing the risk of the pandemic.

103
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:05.710
Um, and this looks a lot like a, uh, what,

104
00:06:05.711 --> 00:06:10.010
what Harvard economists and political scientists are calling a mobilized and

105
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:11.930
transition phase. Uh,

106
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.470
I know our governor here in Texas is going to come out with his plan soon.

107
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:19.220
I think the federal government is as well. I've just written an op-ed about it.

108
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.040
And, um, basically it looks like this. Look, we, we,

109
00:06:23.041 --> 00:06:27.800
we have to dispel this myth that there's a binary choice between a perpetual

110
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:30.290
lockdown and just letting people die.

111
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.630
And the spread of the pandemic that neither of these things are true.

112
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.060
You can do both. Okay. And we have to do both.

113
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.530
This is not an option we have to do both. And, um, it,

114
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.070
I think along three factors, the, we, we have to be focused on testing capacity,

115
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:46.910
which we're a little behind on, but I think we can rather quickly, um,

116
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.850
ramp up to the right standard public health capacity,

117
00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:52.490
meaning our hospitals or ventilators or PPE. I think we're to,

118
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.880
I think we're getting to a much better place on that. Um, and,

119
00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.700
and then public education on how to deal with it. Um,

120
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.720
whether that's standing six feet away from each other, wearing a mask to work,

121
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:03.990
uh, you know, just,

122
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.870
just making those micro changes in your life and in your business so that we

123
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:12.380
can live alongside a pandemic for, for, for a period of time,

124
00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:14.510
until there's a vaccine, that's the new normal,

125
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:17.930
and it doesn't involve shutting down the economy indefinitely. We have been,

126
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.430
this is the last thing I want to say. I,

127
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:24.080
I get really worried when we become obsessive over the nature of the curve and

128
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:28.190
the peak, those are important data points, but they're not the data points.

129
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.730
There's other data points like our sense of preparedness along those three lines

130
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:33.890
that I just mentioned. You know, when I hear,

131
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.970
when I hear our mayor talking about how we can't open up Houston,

132
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:39.560
because we haven't reached the peak yet,

133
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.220
I find that to be absurd because if you put our numbers that we have here in

134
00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:46.970
Houston, which is very, very small, like very, very small,

135
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:50.180
we're the fourth largest city in America. And we barely have any cases. Um,

136
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.970
you know, comparatively speaking, if you put our numbers in place,

137
00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:54.500
those in New York city right now,

138
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:59.000
New York city would be celebrating and they'd open up everything. So if that's,

139
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.100
if, if, if that can be true, then it tells you that our logic isn't correct.

140
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:09.080
As we think about what our, our, our, our, um,

141
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.890
you know, our goalposts are to open up the economy. And I just,

142
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.580
I am encouraging leaders to think through this a little bit more deeply.

143
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.460
<v 2>Yeah. It's one of the reasons, actually,</v>

144
00:08:18.461 --> 00:08:21.460
that I'm kind of hopeful for the future when we get out of this,

145
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:25.450
that some of the right ideas that I think you're writing about in this book will

146
00:08:25.451 --> 00:08:27.640
break forth. I mean, things like States' rights,

147
00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:31.780
like we're actually talking about state's rights right now for the first time in

148
00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:35.290
this country. And God, I don't know, maybe since Roe V Wade,

149
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.010
like we never talk about States' rights. And suddenly people are like, Oh,

150
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:40.780
governors are supposed to do things.

151
00:08:40.781 --> 00:08:44.920
And the president doesn't have ultimate authority and a whole bunch of other

152
00:08:44.921 --> 00:08:45.701
things. Um,

153
00:08:45.701 --> 00:08:49.750
so since the book is about American resilience in the era of outrage,

154
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.800
one thing on American resilience related to Corona specifically,

155
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.550
are you worried that as this has gone on,

156
00:08:56.551 --> 00:09:00.480
and maybe as some of the States get back to work and some take longer,

157
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:02.580
and it looks like New York will take a really long time,

158
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.100
but just the longer that we're in our houses,

159
00:09:05.101 --> 00:09:08.520
the longer that the economy is shut, the longer that we kind of sputter along,

160
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.630
that, that thing, the American resilience that you write about here,

161
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:16.830
that's the special thing we have in America that every other country wishes they

162
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:21.270
had, but the more that we sort of just let government do things and,

163
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.980
Oh, the peak didn't happen yet.

164
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.680
We'll stay in our house for another month like that.

165
00:09:25.681 --> 00:09:30.150
We'd actually start forgetting what that spirit of American resilience is.

166
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:33.600
That's what I'm kind of, I see a lot of silver lines here as a silver linings,

167
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:37.020
as I just mentioned, but that's the thing I'm worried about that over time,

168
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.040
we would just start accepting more and more rules and accepting that more and

169
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:45.390
more experts know what to do when perhaps they don't. And then, you know,

170
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:48.360
the bad actors in government that just sort of want to control all of it.

171
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:54.350
<v 0>Yeah. Those are, those are definitely reasonable fears. I think,</v>

172
00:09:54.351 --> 00:09:58.340
unfortunately the reality is as we shifted towards that acceptance a long time

173
00:09:58.341 --> 00:10:01.880
ago, and I am actually seeing,

174
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:07.490
I think this entire experience might bring us back to normalcy

175
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:13.370
to, to an extent where we do see that experts don't have all the answers there.

176
00:10:13.371 --> 00:10:17.600
Their data is important, their opinions are important, but it takes a leader to,

177
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:21.560
to sift through all of those opinions and then make a bold decision and then get

178
00:10:21.561 --> 00:10:25.850
people to, to, to, to rally behind that decision and mobilize.

179
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.420
<v 2>If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics,</v>
