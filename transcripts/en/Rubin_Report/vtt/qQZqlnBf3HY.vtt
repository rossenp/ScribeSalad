00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.990
<v 0>One other way to see people's real characters where they tell the truth about</v>

2
00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:07.500
the powerful or whether they suck up to the powerful today,

3
00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:12.330
over an MSNBC on their morning show everybody nodded in bovine agreement.

4
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:13.164
Well,

5
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.120
a world health organization official gushed about the fascist government of

6
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:19.200
China. Watch this.

7
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.050
<v 1>Right now. There's very,</v>

8
00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:25.160
very few countries that have actually been able to reverse this, uh, this, um,

9
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.970
uh, epidemic and bring their case to down to very low level. And in fact,

10
00:00:28.971 --> 00:00:33.200
the only country that has done that as China, it was, um, the passion,

11
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.870
the diligence, the sense of responsibility,

12
00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:39.080
the seriousness of the average Chinese.

13
00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:42.080
And I want to use that term very carefully because they weren't average.

14
00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:43.430
They were extraordinary people,

15
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.390
but they were driven by a sense of collective responsibility.

16
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.480
<v 0>Dave Rubin hosts the Rubin report on YouTube. He joins us tonight.</v>

17
00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:55.460
He may not be aware, Dave Rubin,

18
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.790
that these are extraordinary people driven by a sense of collective

19
00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:01.790
responsibility. They're your moral superiors. They're doing the right thing.

20
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:05.540
Unlike America. How do you assess that claim about China?

21
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.430
<v 3>Well, collective is the key word. There. They are a collectivist society.</v>

22
00:01:13.431 --> 00:01:17.780
We are an individualist society, but specifically here, uh, you know,

23
00:01:17.781 --> 00:01:22.610
authoritarians love authoritarianism, meaning they love central planning.

24
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.610
They love the idea that the state can control everything.

25
00:01:25.611 --> 00:01:28.760
That's actually the reverse of the American ethos.

26
00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:32.210
Now neither system is absolutely perfect,

27
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.370
but I personally wouldn't want to trade in my rights and my Liberty

28
00:01:37.371 --> 00:01:41.840
and my free speech and all of those things to have a system of government that

29
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:43.490
could always tell me what to do.

30
00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:48.140
Freedom is a little bit messy and we have to fight that and negotiate that with

31
00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:51.320
the people that would take our freedoms away all the time. Uh,

32
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.290
so what's particularly interesting here though, is that,

33
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.610
you know what they're saying,

34
00:01:55.611 --> 00:02:00.260
basically is give all of your freedoms to the state and then the state can

35
00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:03.890
somehow do everything, right? Except what they forget is the backend of that.

36
00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:07.430
And the backend of that is you, you count people into silence,

37
00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:09.710
you give away your freedoms and, uh,

38
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.400
and you end up living in a place that most of us wouldn't want to live,

39
00:02:13.401 --> 00:02:16.880
which is why Americans don't leave because we got a pretty good.

40
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.290
<v 0>They're praising.</v>

41
00:02:18.291 --> 00:02:22.460
They're praising a government that harvest the organs from murdered political

42
00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:24.230
prisoners. Should that make us nervous?

43
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.120
<v 3>Of course it should make us nervous.</v>

44
00:02:29.121 --> 00:02:34.070
But the idea is the same people who want to import or authoritarian ideas

45
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:38.090
here are the same people that love those ideas elsewhere.

46
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.250
So they never talk about the bad things, right?

47
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:44.960
They're not going to talk about the bad things about communism on MSNBC because

48
00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:48.980
they kind of like it, right? So they slowly, they tell you the good things, Oh,

49
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.710
in times of crisis, they've been able to organize in a certain way.

50
00:02:51.711 --> 00:02:52.544
Now that's also,

51
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.270
if you're going to really believe the numbers coming out of China and everything

52
00:02:56.271 --> 00:03:00.730
else. So it's hard to figure out what's true right now. And I, again,

53
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.230
freedom is the key thing.

54
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:06.730
What we're all having to do right now is decide how much freedom do we want to

55
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:08.770
give away in the midst of a crisis.

56
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:11.380
And that's an important debate to have it's when you've been having quite well

57
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.370
on this show, actually.

58
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.590
<v 0>Well, we're trying, there's so much going on Dave and great to see you tonight.</v>

59
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.453
