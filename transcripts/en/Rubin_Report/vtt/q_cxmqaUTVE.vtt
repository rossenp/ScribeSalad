00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.980
<v 0>I asked on Twitter, a little Twitter poll.</v>

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.660
Have any of you actually lied to the pollsters about your support for Trump?

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.640
Hundreds of people said yes, and they weren't saying we might lie,

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.000
or we think we'll do it in the future. They said,

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.860
we have this year.

6
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.940
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

7
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.480
<v 2>As locals.</v>

8
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.750
We hear on the Rubin report and I'm doing a series of mini interviews with

9
00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:37.550
creators on why they decided to become less reliant on big tech and instead own

10
00:00:37.551 --> 00:00:40.910
their content, community and livelihood with locals.com.

11
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.200
Joining me today is the creator of the legendary Dilbert comic strip,

12
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.940
as well as a best-selling author and guy who really, really loves coffee.

13
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.220
Scott Adams, welcome back to the Rubin report.

14
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.350
<v 0>Thanks Steve. Thanks for having me.</v>

15
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.030
<v 2>How much coffee do you drink a day?</v>

16
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.390
I always think you're just drinking coffee constantly. Basically.

17
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.800
<v 0>Yeah. Christina,</v>

18
00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:05.390
my wife gave me a new Trek where I only do half coffee and half hot water.

19
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.520
And instead of coffee,

20
00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:11.240
it's like a coffee flavored beverage that you can drink more of it.

21
00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:13.580
So that's my current track for doubling.

22
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.760
<v 2>Well, I think that's a little bit like an Americano, right?</v>

23
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.210
Isn't that when you go to Europe and you drink an Americano with just coffee and

24
00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:22.430
they just add water to it, I think maybe.

25
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.330
<v 0>You know, I don't know my coffee is, but I'm going to say yes.</v>

26
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.100
I'm just going to say yes to that.

27
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.520
<v 2>You got very long Island there. When you said coffee, your coffee,</v>

28
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.540
you don't know your coffee.

29
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.520
<v 0>Well, I'm upstate New York,</v>

30
00:01:34.521 --> 00:01:39.140
so we drink coffee and we go up on the roof and down,

31
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.570
down by the Creek, we go swimming.

32
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.650
<v 2>Well, I'm going to send you one of these locals coffee mugs. We've got one. Uh,</v>

33
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.580
but before we get into locals and you've absolutely just crushed it on there.

34
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.360
Um, I wanted to talk about something separate altogether,

35
00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:57.440
which is that because we live in this strange time where it seems no one can

36
00:01:57.441 --> 00:02:01.640
make sense of anything. You're one of the people on a very short list.

37
00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:04.070
I can probably do it on one hand. Uh,

38
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.580
people who I think are actually making some sense.

39
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.820
Did you ever think you were going to be a sense-maker? I mean,

40
00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:14.900
that's partly what being a comic guy is. You're,

41
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:17.000
you're making little quips and you're trying to make sense of the world,

42
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:19.130
but did you ever think it was going to be this level of it?

43
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.601
<v 0>You know,</v>

44
00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:24.410
you're asking me the most embarrassing question you possibly could because the

45
00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:28.670
answer is yes here. Yeah.

46
00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:33.170
I know the answer is yes and my whole life actually.

47
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.160
So, um, I, I always had an image there someday.

48
00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:38.930
I didn't know what path I would take,

49
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.370
but that I would be doing something in public in which I would be explaining

50
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:47.930
things to people who needed a little help, having things explained. So,

51
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.980
you know, it's, it's amazing that it ended up the way it ended up,

52
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.280
because the way I got here could not have been predicted and then the way,

53
00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.220
but yes, the answer is I did see my future. Exactly. Like this. Yeah.

54
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.300
<v 2>Are you shocked though,</v>

55
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:05.770
to see that the general systems of sense-making our institutions,

56
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:08.640
the media, the rest of the stuff that, you know, guys,

57
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.180
I got to spend most of our day talking about,

58
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.320
are you shocked to see how rapidly they've crumbled or is this,

59
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:17.800
is this just the last gasp of air? Like what's happening right now?

60
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.220
<v 0>Well, I think Trump took, took the last bit of credibility out of the system,</v>

61
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.490
but all he did was reveal what the system was.

62
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.560
I don't think that he changed it as much as he revealed it and then we can see

63
00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:35.610
it. So who knows how corrupt the news used to be? I mean,

64
00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:39.090
I used to hear his stories back in Kennedy's day of the, you know,

65
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.370
Kennedy would go out in the yacht and take the,

66
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.700
take the New York times or the other top reporters with them.

67
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.290
And did he get good coverage? Of course he did. Of course he did.

68
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.700
So, you know, things are different, but I don't know if they're more corrupt.

69
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.130
I think we just might be a little more aware of it.

70
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.090
And the thing that Trump did is he just completely just said,

71
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.190
I think I'll just say whatever I want to say.

72
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.570
As long as it leads me in a productive way, that's good for the country.

73
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.170
Didn't worry about the facts and it didn't hurt him at all.

74
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.080
He became president and doing that when everybody was saying,

75
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.310
we he'll be president,

76
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.570
if you keep saying things that the fact checkers don't agree with and that he

77
00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:20.670
did, and he proved that it didn't matter that much.

78
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.890
<v 2>Didn't worry about the facts when,</v>

79
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.030
when people criticize you or they criticize me or some of the other people that

80
00:04:27.031 --> 00:04:30.420
are just walking around, not even that are necessarily raw Trump people,

81
00:04:30.421 --> 00:04:33.870
but just don't suffer from Trump derangement syndrome. That's the thing,

82
00:04:33.871 --> 00:04:36.510
the facts, the facts, the facts, the facts. How do you,

83
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.050
I've heard you explain it a little bit, but,

84
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:42.540
but how do you explain his sort of loose relationship with the facts?

85
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.110
<v 0>Well, I call it directionally accurate.</v>

86
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.910
So if Trump says something like, well, there were 40,000 people at my rally,

87
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.650
but the real number was 25,000. It's kind of the same, right?

88
00:04:55.651 --> 00:04:58.950
It doesn't change how you think about it. A lot of people came to the rally.

89
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.450
How much should it have been?

90
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.070
I don't know if he says the economy is the best economy we've ever

91
00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:09.330
had, but it's only the best one in the last 40 years.

92
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.870
Does that help us or does it hurt us? Well,

93
00:05:12.871 --> 00:05:17.730
it helps us because the economy is as a psychology engine, as I like to say.

94
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.790
And if you think it's doing well, you invest, you buy,

95
00:05:20.791 --> 00:05:22.980
you have confidence and then it does well.

96
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.840
So he has the ability to use hyperbole and a little bit of exaggeration

97
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.800
to make things work better than they would have worked without it,

98
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.410
which is completely different than a flat out lie.

99
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.090
Like let's say that the fine people hoax, that's nothing but a divisive lie.

100
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.640
That's a bad, you know,

101
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.900
missing the fact checking that that's as bad as you can get. But if you're,

102
00:05:45.901 --> 00:05:48.900
if you're just talking something up that needs to be talked up, that's fine.

103
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.020
<v 2>I actually, wasn't gonna bring this up. Let's just do it real quick.</v>

104
00:05:52.021 --> 00:05:54.540
Before we get to your community, the very fine people hoax.

105
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.920
You were one of the first people,

106
00:05:55.921 --> 00:06:00.680
at least like sort of mainstream ish people or someone with some

107
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:04.480
credit, let's say that was calling out the very fine people, hoax and,

108
00:06:04.481 --> 00:06:09.200
and pointing out that before he said very fine people on both

109
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:13.340
sides, which he meant about the debate, the monument argument in and of itself,

110
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.400
that really, he had condemned the white nationalists in the KKK.

111
00:06:16.401 --> 00:06:20.900
The sentence before Biden has said that this is the reason he's running for

112
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:23.900
president yet the media doesn't call him out on it. Does,

113
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.700
does anything shock you at this point?

114
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:26.831
<v 0>I,</v>

115
00:06:26.831 --> 00:06:31.660
I really don't understand if the media doesn't know it's a lie because they'd

116
00:06:31.661 --> 00:06:35.830
been reporting it as true for so long and they all believe that they saw it.

117
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.170
They saw it with their own eyes, heard it with their own ears.

118
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.620
Now what they saw and heard was the edited part, where they take,

119
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.520
they take out the sentence where he clarified that he totally wasn't talking

120
00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:48.250
about those people in the clearer, clear as possible,

121
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.580
where it's they just leave that out. And that it's misleading. So, uh, the,

122
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.560
the fact that the media does that is still puzzling to me because I can't tell

123
00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.800
how intentional it is or if they're really just fooled by their own propaganda.

124
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:01.630
It's hard to tell.

125
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.890
<v 2>It's kinda, I always think it's like,</v>

126
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.760
they've gone so deep with it and repeated it so many times that it would be just

127
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.730
too, it would like shatter their world, basically.

128
00:07:09.731 --> 00:07:12.190
If they had to admit that it wasn't true. It's something like that.

129
00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.650
<v 0>Yeah. That's why, uh, Trump basically could win the election just by, uh,</v>

130
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:21.850
bringing that up at a, at a debate and just, you know, just stop the show,

131
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.170
bring that up and say, look, here's the deal. People go look up the transcript,

132
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:31.030
see for yourself. If they've been lying about the central theme of the campaign,

133
00:07:31.031 --> 00:07:34.030
I won't even tell you what I think. Just go look at the transcript,

134
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.980
get back to me. That'd be the end of it.

135
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:38.890
<v 2>Now, can you imagine that during a debate, if he just literally said,</v>

136
00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:40.660
I'm actually not even going to, I have two minutes,

137
00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:43.990
I'm not going to talk for the next minute and a half. Google it right now.

138
00:07:43.991 --> 00:07:46.600
That would actually, it would crack the internet.

139
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:51.850
<v 0>Google find people, hoax those three words and you'll get all your words.</v>

140
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.460
<v 2>There you go. All right, Scott, let's, let's talk about your locals community.</v>

141
00:07:54.461 --> 00:07:57.890
Cause you, you were one of the first people that we brought on board. You,

142
00:07:57.891 --> 00:08:02.740
you were on Patrion before. And I kinda was like, you know,

143
00:08:02.741 --> 00:08:06.040
I think we got a better option for you. We, we took a couple of meetings.

144
00:08:06.041 --> 00:08:07.000
You jumped on board.

145
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.440
Can you just tell me a little bit about what your experience has been like and

146
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.410
why you think what you're doing over there is working because it really is

147
00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:16.480
working. You you've got a very vibrant community.

148
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.450
<v 0>Yeah. It's it's far exceeded. My,</v>

149
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:22.390
my expectations is it's way better than I thought.

150
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:27.730
And the problem I was having with the other social media from YouTube

151
00:08:27.731 --> 00:08:32.380
and Twitter is that I couldn't control what anybody saw because Twitter could

152
00:08:32.381 --> 00:08:37.000
shadow ban me. YouTube could de monetize me and it looked like one wrong move.

153
00:08:37.001 --> 00:08:38.320
And I would just be on the business.

154
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.970
So here I am putting tons of work into something that I have no control over.

155
00:08:42.971 --> 00:08:45.340
They can just snap a finger and I'm out of business.

156
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:50.230
So I thought it wouldn't be good to have one place where there's only

157
00:08:50.231 --> 00:08:52.090
subscribers. They want to be there.

158
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:57.630
They're basically no trolls because trolls don't want to subscribe to something

159
00:08:57.631 --> 00:08:58.770
to just complain.

160
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:02.940
So it ends up being this happy place where you don't get all the nastiness of

161
00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:07.530
the other platforms and I can't be canceled. It's sort of perfect. And,

162
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.370
and monetarily it's been, you know what, like I said,

163
00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:14.580
it exceeded my expectations almost embarrassing.

164
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.930
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

165
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.980
Do you think that the future of the internet is subscription-based as opposed to

166
00:09:18.981 --> 00:09:23.600
ad based or, or in effect that we, the, the free people are the product?

167
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.180
<v 0>Well, if I speak for myself, I can't handle ads anymore. Not,</v>

168
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:32.660
not any kind of ads. I can't watch regular TV.

169
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:36.590
I just can't watch anything with an ad. You know? So even on YouTube,

170
00:09:36.591 --> 00:09:39.890
I'll pay the subscription. So I don't have to watch the ads.

171
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:43.040
So I can't see other people being that different.

172
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:47.870
I think a social media has as shortened, our collective attention spans.

173
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.280
So sending there for like a five minutes of ads or even one minute of

174
00:09:52.281 --> 00:09:55.040
advertising seems, it just seems impossible.

175
00:09:55.041 --> 00:09:58.060
Now we're in the old days you thought, well, it's just that men,

176
00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:00.043
but now a minute is.

177
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.370
<v 2>I mean, a minute, man,</v>

178
00:10:01.371 --> 00:10:05.360
when I'm watching YouTube and there's a seven second unskippable ad, it's like,

179
00:10:05.361 --> 00:10:09.530
I'm pressing that Roku. I'm pressing that button over and over and over.

180
00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:12.050
Try not try to buy back a second of my life.

181
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.430
<v 0>Yeah. I'm trying to start a hobby. I'm like seven</v>

182
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.400
[inaudible].

183
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.630
<v 2>What can I do in seven seconds?</v>

184
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:23.480
So one of the things that I think is interesting about what you've done with

185
00:10:23.481 --> 00:10:28.220
your community is you're putting edgier content there, stuff that either you're,

186
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:32.240
you kind of want to test out with your own people or that you think maybe is

187
00:10:32.241 --> 00:10:36.070
going to bring you more flack from, from the normies. Um, what,

188
00:10:36.071 --> 00:10:37.130
what was the idea behind it?

189
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:39.481
<v 0>Yeah, there,</v>

190
00:10:39.481 --> 00:10:43.160
there's some types of content that if you put it out in the general public,

191
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:48.050
it just attracts trolls. But if I'm in my subscription community, it's all,

192
00:10:48.051 --> 00:10:51.500
it's only people want to be there. So people, you know,

193
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.140
they may comment that they disagree with it,

194
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.210
but it will be a polite disagreement.

195
00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.380
So there's lots of stuff that I just wouldn't bother putting on the regular

196
00:11:00.381 --> 00:11:02.420
internet because I just don't want to, you know,

197
00:11:02.421 --> 00:11:06.650
deal with the blowback on locals. As I often say to them, I go,

198
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.320
don't spread this outside of locals. You know,

199
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.570
not like they could if they wanted to, but,

200
00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.140
but I asked them to and they don't weirdly. I mean, that's,

201
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:19.100
that's amazing to imagine, imagine thousands of people. And I say,

202
00:11:19.101 --> 00:11:20.630
this would really get me in trouble.

203
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.330
Don't put this on the internet and they don't,

204
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:28.700
they don't now none of it would kill me. So I'm not going to put anything there.

205
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.220
That's going to take me down to go completely.

206
00:11:31.221 --> 00:11:34.510
But I really appreciate the fact that they, they actually keep it on low.

207
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.480
<v 2>Can you talk a little bit just about the community side of it and what kind of</v>

208
00:11:38.481 --> 00:11:41.180
interactions you're having with people there? Cause you know,

209
00:11:41.181 --> 00:11:45.260
like everybody else that I'm talking to this week and myself included, you know,

210
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.150
it's like we can get into it with the,

211
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.030
with the trolls and all the haters and all of that stuff.

212
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:51.800
But you said they're not even, they're not even there.

213
00:11:51.801 --> 00:11:54.040
So you're getting some actual human communication.

214
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:59.710
<v 0>Yeah. The part of what I didn't expect is that the, uh, the other community,</v>

215
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:02.590
people who just are paying money to follow me,

216
00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.970
I didn't understand how much content they would be posting themselves.

217
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.360
And at first, when I saw other people posting, to be honest,

218
00:12:10.361 --> 00:12:14.470
my first impression was, Hey, you know, I'm the one who should be posting

219
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.220
a little bit more about me. And I started looking at their posts and I was like,

220
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.380
Oh, that's pretty good. And then see another one's like, Oh,

221
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.990
I didn't see that on Twitter. That's very interesting.

222
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.780
So they ended up curating all these things.

223
00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:33.670
Then since then they know I'm the sort of leader of the community.

224
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.820
They assume other people in the community or would like what I would like.

225
00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:41.410
And then they end up guessing really well, what I would be interested in.

226
00:12:41.411 --> 00:12:44.410
So it's fascinating that way. And then there are a lot of direct messages.

227
00:12:44.411 --> 00:12:48.520
People pay a little bit more to direct message me and I try to answer all of

228
00:12:48.521 --> 00:12:50.080
those if I can. Yeah.

229
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:50.761
<v 2>How,</v>

230
00:12:50.761 --> 00:12:54.660
how different do you think the internet is going to look in five or 10 years?

231
00:12:54.661 --> 00:12:56.030
Do you think we're really like, I,

232
00:12:56.031 --> 00:13:00.120
I'm starting to feel like we're really at the end of this version of the

233
00:13:00.121 --> 00:13:01.230
internet, that in a certain way,

234
00:13:01.231 --> 00:13:03.540
this election almost feels like the end of everything.

235
00:13:03.541 --> 00:13:06.750
The debates feel like the end of the debates. I feel like we've,

236
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.060
we've taken Facebook and Twitter.

237
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:13.110
We've taken all of these things to their end conclusion and that the internet of

238
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.680
2024, 2025 is going to be way,

239
00:13:16.681 --> 00:13:18.930
way different than what we're looking at right now.

240
00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.770
<v 0>Well, I've argued that, uh,</v>

241
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:27.360
artificial intelligence has already taken over the world. Um,

242
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:31.560
it's just not exactly the way we thought it would be. It's not in a robot body.

243
00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:33.530
It doesn't talk to us. But the,

244
00:13:33.531 --> 00:13:36.810
the algorithms of the social media platforms,

245
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:38.820
they decide what you see.

246
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.900
And they decide based on a simple rule of what's going to make the most money.

247
00:13:42.901 --> 00:13:45.900
And nobody goes to jail, you know, just a few other considerations.

248
00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:51.030
And as long as that algorithm is going toward that one outcome,

249
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.540
it's going to cause people to be at each other's necks.

250
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:59.070
So a lot of the fighting and the conflict and the divisiveness

251
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.430
comes from math. It comes from the algorithms.

252
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:06.390
It's not people deciding that we should fight. It's the machine.

253
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.600
The machine decided that we're going to fight the machine,

254
00:14:09.601 --> 00:14:13.110
decided that I'm going to see something that's going to make my hair catch on

255
00:14:13.111 --> 00:14:16.560
fire. And then I go over to locals. There's no algorithm.

256
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.610
There's just people doing what they want to do with the people they want to do

257
00:14:20.611 --> 00:14:24.930
it with. And suddenly I feel like it's human as human contact. Again,

258
00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.770
it's like real people, but I think AI is literally,

259
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:33.270
I don't mean this in a figurative analogy kind of way.

260
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:38.100
I think it's behind us. The takeover. I don't think it's in front of us. Right.

261
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.940
<v 2>Game is fixed and we keep playing anyway. All right, Scott, gimme,</v>

262
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.600
gimme a prediction for the election. Have you made an official prediction? Yeah.

263
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.080
<v 0>Well,</v>

264
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:51.680
I've been saying that Trump would win from the start he's he's sucking air in

265
00:14:51.681 --> 00:14:52.514
the polls,

266
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.180
but I'm going to stick with my prediction that the polls are inaccurate and

267
00:14:56.181 --> 00:14:59.270
people are lying to those pollsters because it's funny.

268
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.310
It's funny. I asked on Twitter a little Twitter poll.

269
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:09.020
Have any of you actually lied to the pollsters about your support for Trump?

270
00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.570
Hundreds of people said yes.

271
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:16.250
And they weren't saying we might lie or we think we'll do it in the future.

272
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:20.300
They said we have this year. Yeah.

273
00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:22.900
<v 2>Well, what I saw, I saw today as we're taping this,</v>

274
00:15:22.901 --> 00:15:23.830
we're holding it for a few days,

275
00:15:23.831 --> 00:15:27.400
but I saw an article that was from four years ago today.

276
00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:32.170
And it said it had the average of the healer of the polls were Hillary up by 14

277
00:15:32.171 --> 00:15:36.100
points. And Hillary obviously lost. So right now when they show you, okay,

278
00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:39.790
Biden's up by maybe four points. It's like guys,

279
00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:41.770
deja VU all over again. I mean, come on.

280
00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.420
<v 0>It could be. But you know, the,</v>

281
00:15:44.421 --> 00:15:48.970
the one thing that you can count on with 2020 is we're not done.

282
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.110
We're not done. You know, it's not like we're going to wait.

283
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:55.660
Nothing's going to happen between now and election day.

284
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.350
There's a lot that's going to happen between them. And so anything could happen.

285
00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:00.730
<v 2>Ain't it? The truth. All right.</v>

286
00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:04.210
Like a professional pimp out your local so we can send people over there and

287
00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.790
they can see all that tolerance and decency.

288
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:11.560
<v 0>Yes. It's got out of them. Stop locals.com. Did I get that right?</v>

289
00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.220
<v 2>That's what I have right here. Very impressive. Scott Adams,</v>

290
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:20.230
you are a man of persuasion. Thanks for having me. All right. Thanks my friend.
