1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.980
<v 0>It's not that the election was rigged per se by</v>

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.840
the States or the vote counters or mail in ballots.

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.820
It's that it was essentially rigged by CNN, Los Angeles, times,

4
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:18.660
New York times, most all legacy and mainstream media,

5
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.360
and then big tech and, you know,

6
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.870
all the Googles and the Twitter and all that, all that.

7
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:29.040
It was rigged by them essentially. And if you really think about it,

8
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.080
it's not much hyperbole.

9
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.580
<v 1>All right. Let's talk about the election a little bit.</v>

10
00:00:40.581 --> 00:00:43.910
I'm just giving you like the whole landscape of all the craziness of the world,

11
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.220
the election, where he at at this point,

12
00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:48.980
apparently Joe Biden is the president elect.

13
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.480
I don't think you voted for Joe Biden. Did you, did,

14
00:00:52.481 --> 00:00:54.950
did you officially announce who you voted for? I know where,

15
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.110
where you're at politically, but did you actually say it?

16
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.030
<v 0>No, but, uh, I would definitely vote for Trump over, over by, um,</v>

17
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.100
the, the, the interesting take on it, which isn't,

18
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.600
you know, insanely impressive in terms of the math, but, uh,

19
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.850
sort of what Ben Shapiro is always been talking about for the last several

20
00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:17.684
weeks,

21
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.550
which is it's not that the election was rigged

22
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.440
per se by the States or the vote counters or

23
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.300
mail in ballots. It's that it was essentially rigged by CNN,

24
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.910
Los Angeles, times, New York times,

25
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.950
most all legacy and mainstream media, and then big tech,

26
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.030
you know, all the Googles and the Twitter and all that, all that.

27
00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:48.170
It was rigged by them essentially. And if you really think about it,

28
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.780
it's not much hyperbole. I mean,

29
00:01:50.781 --> 00:01:54.470
if you think about just the Hunter Biden story,

30
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.320
as an example, and you go, okay,

31
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.400
and forget it's Hunter Biden and forget what the allegations are and forget

32
00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:06.380
anything. Let's just be generic. There's a story, it's a credible story.

33
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.500
And it would hurt one candidate.

34
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.910
And I don't know if that means three points or seven points,

35
00:02:13.911 --> 00:02:16.040
or I don't know what it would translate into,

36
00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:20.930
but it would definitely be damaging to one of the candidates. So in our,

37
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.510
in our hypothetical world,

38
00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:28.460
there's a candidate and B candidate and B candidate would definitely be

39
00:02:28.461 --> 00:02:33.440
hurt by a story that comes out several days before

40
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.460
the big election.

41
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.560
And then all the legacy news organizations.

42
00:02:39.561 --> 00:02:42.200
And then, and then Silicon Valley,

43
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.180
they all conspire to crush a story and are saying things like

44
00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:50.420
Russian disinformation or there's no proof whatsoever.

45
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.390
So that story never comes out. Well,

46
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.810
I would argue that that is tampering with the election.

47
00:02:56.811 --> 00:02:59.030
It's certainly affecting the election. I mean,

48
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.820
guess if you say what's the definition of tampering with an election,

49
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:08.590
I guess the definition would be affecting the election one way or the

50
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:10.900
other for this candidate or that candidate.

51
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.060
So there are all onboard to do this. They always do this thing.

52
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.190
It's funny when the smartest people in the world, the Silicon Valley guys go,

53
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.330
Oh yeah, we didn't know what was going on with that thing. We made a mistake.

54
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.040
<v 1>We're going to get better processes. We should have looked at that before.</v>

55
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.900
<v 0>Right. You didn't know. Huh. And, and by the way,</v>

56
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.460
it's pretty simple. Uh, they found a laptop, had a bunch of information on it.

57
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.050
Might you have some follow-up questions or we just announced that's Russian

58
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.730
disinformation. So you had a whole group of people.

59
00:03:47.731 --> 00:03:51.930
And when I say a group, I mean, most 90% of the media,

60
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.940
essentially running interference for one of the candidates and,

61
00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.120
and all the way through just, you know, the COVID vaccines,

62
00:04:00.121 --> 00:04:02.730
never going to come out before the end of the year, et cetera.

63
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.400
And every single story, uh, yeah, that's going to translate into a few points.

64
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.670
And that is, that is the tampering.

65
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.560
<v 1>I think there's anything left at this point in terms of mainstream media.</v>

66
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.550
Like I think if,

67
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.780
if my one takeaway probably of the year beyond

68
00:04:21.781 --> 00:04:24.030
lockdowns and the way we give up freedoms and all that,

69
00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:27.990
but like my one sort of tangible takeaway is that there is simply nothing left

70
00:04:27.991 --> 00:04:28.830
in mainstream media.

71
00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:32.610
That doesn't mean that a hundred percent of reporters are all artists,

72
00:04:32.611 --> 00:04:35.670
but I think the way they treated the Hunter by it in story,

73
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:40.020
then the way we were immediately told not to look at anything related to

74
00:04:40.021 --> 00:04:41.880
election fraud. And if we did, we're,

75
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.090
we're basically Alex Jones and everything else, like to me,

76
00:04:45.091 --> 00:04:49.980
there's nothing left, you know, Washington post New York times CNN,

77
00:04:49.981 --> 00:04:53.400
like it's just done. Am I, am I over the top?

78
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.950
<v 0>Well, there's something left, but the question is,</v>

79
00:04:58.951 --> 00:05:03.840
is what did they do to their brand? So if you think about,

80
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.450
think about what the Oscars means in 2021,

81
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.620
versus the Oscars from our childhood, it was first off,

82
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.920
it was appointment viewing, get the whole family,

83
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.920
see who the best picture of the year who got the,

84
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.460
and the best picture of the year got that was the best picture of the year.

85
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.570
You know, I mean,

86
00:05:24.571 --> 00:05:28.530
we didn't argue about it and we didn't think there was any politics involved and

87
00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:31.620
it just was, you know, and by the way, you know,

88
00:05:31.621 --> 00:05:35.370
when you look at the ratings for the shows, you realize it,

89
00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:38.580
ain't what it used to be by, by long shot. And,

90
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.900
and I'll give you a couple examples. So think about the Oscars.

91
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.120
Think about the Amies think,

92
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.020
think about how I did a little experiment around here.

93
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.810
I've young people work for me. I said, uh,

94
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.010
if you heard a story out of CNN five years ago, what would you have thought?

95
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.300
And they went, I would believed it. And I'd say, what do you think now?

96
00:05:59.301 --> 00:06:03.470
And they go, eh, I'd have to go look into it. So CNN,

97
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.720
New York times, all, all the entities you mentioned, but also Oscars,

98
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.700
Amie, uh, maybe the NBA, uh, rotten tomatoes,

99
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.040
you know, you see a hillbilly Elegy, Oh, it's 24% with the critics,

100
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:22.130
but 88 with the people, Oh, what a shocker, you know,

101
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.230
no safe spaces is I dunno,

102
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:29.180
44% with the critics and 90% with the people. So,

103
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:31.250
so now we no longer have to go to,

104
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.020
we don't have to find out what the critics have to say on, uh, rotten tomatoes,

105
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:39.770
because it's skewed. Everything is skewed and whoever wins,

106
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:42.410
the Oscar is going to be, you know, Oh, he's the,

107
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.520
he's the black gay teen is struggling with his sexuality. Like, okay, I get it.

108
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.280
And, and, and by the way, when you do that,

109
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.990
you are shaking hands with the devil. You really are in terms of your brand,

110
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.310
the Oscars should have never let all this super woke in.

111
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.680
Because once you announce,

112
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.890
we now need 50% people of color nominated for the best

113
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:10.610
actor. It's over, we stop, we stop. We go, well,

114
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.730
were they the best actors or is they just meeting a quota?

115
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.860
So they're shooting themselves in the foot.

116
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.300
<v 1>But the best part of it is they decided to put all these quotas in about,</v>

117
00:07:19.301 --> 00:07:21.850
you know, skin, color, and sexuality. And you know,

118
00:07:21.851 --> 00:07:24.790
if you're a midget or you have a lazy eye or whatever, except they said,

119
00:07:24.791 --> 00:07:26.770
we're not going to do it for three years.

120
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.400
It's so important to solve racism and sexism,

121
00:07:30.401 --> 00:07:32.290
but we still have some stuff in the can.

122
00:07:32.291 --> 00:07:35.350
So we got to get that racist crap out of the way. And we'll do it,

123
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.290
do it in three years. You mentioned no safe spaces.

124
00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:41.860
So I'm sure most of my audience has seen it already. But when,

125
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.840
when you think back to the project,

126
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.140
cause you guys probably you and Dennis and the team probably started working on

127
00:07:47.141 --> 00:07:49.750
this thing, what like four years ago, maybe something like that.

128
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.700
W when you think back to the project, I mean, basically everything.

129
00:07:54.701 --> 00:07:57.550
And I'm not just saying it cause, cause we both happen to be in it.

130
00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.830
But everything that no safe spaces is about,

131
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:04.660
which in essence is that all of this woke craziness from the college campus is

132
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.890
going to leak into re into real society. It's what everyone sees now.

133
00:08:08.891 --> 00:08:11.470
And we were all told we were racists and bigots and the rest of it.

134
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.840
If we're talking about it, are you, are you kind of,

135
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.440
are you like impressed that we kind of called it?

136
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.550
Or are you depressed that we kind of called it or just is what it is?

137
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:26.070
Cause we called it, we all called it. Now everyone knows that that is the,

138
00:08:26.071 --> 00:08:28.150
the stuff that is happening everywhere right now.

139
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.770
<v 0>Well, first off, how could it not like, what if,</v>

140
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:36.070
what if your kid leaves for college?

141
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:41.260
And then every one of their professors is a vegan and then they're teaching

142
00:08:41.261 --> 00:08:45.010
classes on meat is murder. Don't tell your chef husband.

143
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.790
Cause he makes a delectable Wagyu. I think we have.

144
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.550
<v 1>Did I hear correctly on your podcast?</v>

145
00:08:51.551 --> 00:08:55.060
I think the day or a day or two after you came over here for dinner, I,

146
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.000
you said it was the best steak you ever had.

147
00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.440
<v 0>It was man. So,</v>

148
00:08:59.441 --> 00:09:03.380
so kudos to you for a living with that.

149
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.770
I was doing this. Oh. You're.

150
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.433
<v 1>Right.</v>

151
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.030
<v 0>Yeah, no, I had a cup. I had a couple of scotches at that point.</v>

152
00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:20.030
Sorry, Dave, you get all credit to Dave Rubin for doing the, doing the steak,

153
00:09:20.031 --> 00:09:23.600
but um, the hell we're talking about, and I forgot about it.

154
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:24.531
<v 1>That you send,</v>

155
00:09:24.531 --> 00:09:26.630
if you send your kids to these schools and they're being taught by them.

156
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:31.160
<v 0>Oh yeah. Okay. So everyone's a vegan and meat is murder. Uh,</v>

157
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:35.930
how long before your kids starts coming home for Thanksgiving and saying, no,

158
00:09:35.931 --> 00:09:38.420
thanks to the Turkey because meat is murder.

159
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:43.520
And then when those kids in their vegan environment get pushed

160
00:09:43.521 --> 00:09:48.410
out into main street and Madison Avenue and start showing up at

161
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:49.520
corporations,

162
00:09:49.521 --> 00:09:54.380
how long before they start judging people for eating a ham sandwich and how

163
00:09:54.381 --> 00:09:58.400
could it go any other way? Of course, it's going to go that way. I mean,

164
00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:59.301
you get,

165
00:09:59.301 --> 00:10:03.380
you go to this place where a bunch of ideology is taught to you and then

166
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:05.780
the construct, or,

167
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:10.520
or at least college is basically there to,

168
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:14.780
I mean, if you think about what, what is the, what,

169
00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:17.510
what is the mission statement for college? Well,

170
00:10:17.511 --> 00:10:22.190
you go to this place for four years, we teach you a bunch of stuff.

171
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.720
And then you take that with you into society. Right? Well,

172
00:10:26.721 --> 00:10:30.650
we just thought it was going to be a bunch of engineering and calculus and you

173
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.551
know, art history.

174
00:10:31.551 --> 00:10:35.030
We didn't know what was going to be an indoctrination to a bunch of ideas,

175
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.170
but it is.

176
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:40.790
And I would argue those ideas are more powerful than engineering are because you

177
00:10:40.791 --> 00:10:45.440
can't just walk into your new job at Kinko's and start talking to everyone about

178
00:10:45.441 --> 00:10:49.070
structural engineering or shear loads or tension anchors or something.

179
00:10:49.071 --> 00:10:50.540
They're not going to, it's not going to take,

180
00:10:50.541 --> 00:10:53.930
but if you start talking to everyone about your ideology,

181
00:10:53.931 --> 00:10:56.630
then it's going to spread. And that's exactly where we're living.
