1
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.303
<v 0>All right.</v>

2
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.780
<v 1>April. It is Monday, October 26, 2020.</v>

3
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.640
We are eight days from the election from the day that we'll

4
00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:21.470
decide the fate of humanity, eight freaking days, people, here we go.

5
00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:25.400
All right. I normally don't do direct messages on Mondays and Fridays. However,

6
00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:27.050
I'm doing a mini one right now.

7
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.420
Then we're going to do our regular shows Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,

8
00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:32.900
and then we're going to do another one on Friday because obviously this week is

9
00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:35.510
going to be, as I like to say, bananas,

10
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.390
it's going to be ultra bananas this week, obviously.

11
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.600
And then I can only imagine what's going to happen into the weekend and Monday

12
00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:44.720
and Tuesday. And then once their election results, aren't accepted,

13
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.150
then you know, the next couple of years and all that, but, well,

14
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.310
one thing at a time let's just deal with today as it is.

15
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.540
So I'm doing just a quick show today where I'm just going to show you two clips,

16
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.110
uh, that the mainstream media won't show you.

17
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.390
You are obviously not going to see these on CNN.

18
00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:02.720
You're not going to see them on ABC, NBC, CBS, or anywhere else,

19
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.880
but these are on fire online.

20
00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:08.150
And when I talk about the reality war,

21
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.070
the fact that whether you watch online stuff or mainstream

22
00:01:13.071 --> 00:01:16.100
stuff and which online stuff and mainstream stuff, you watch,

23
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.090
you live in it actually different reality at this point,

24
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.410
then people who consume other things. I think that if you're watching this,

25
00:01:24.411 --> 00:01:26.270
your reality is somewhat similar to mine.

26
00:01:26.271 --> 00:01:30.650
And I think we've got a pretty decent grasp on reality over here, but, but even,

27
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.770
even I'm going to have my blind spots, but I thought that these two clips,

28
00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.530
which are so indicative of something that's happening right now,

29
00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:39.230
that the mainstream won't talk about were important to show.

30
00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:43.220
So this first clip that we're going to throw to this is, uh, Joe Biden,

31
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.980
forgetting who he's running against.

32
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.330
<v 2>This is the most consequent,</v>

33
00:01:47.331 --> 00:01:50.230
not because I'm running it because who I'm running against this,

34
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.070
the most consequential election, uh, and, uh, and a long, long, long time.

35
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.730
And the character of the country in my view is literally on the ballot.

36
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.960
What kind of country we're going to be four more years of Georgia, Georgia.

37
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.640
He, uh, he's going to find ourselves in a position where if, uh,

38
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.010
Trump gets elected, uh, we're going to be, uh,

39
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.160
we're going to be in a different world. And, um, and so.

40
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.140
<v 1>All right, glibness and sarcasm and humor aside.</v>

41
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.160
Um, I feel bad for the sign language lady,

42
00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:24.230
because what was she supposed to do in the middle of that? All right,

43
00:02:24.231 --> 00:02:27.590
that wasn't glibness aside. Um, this is seriously depressing.

44
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.180
Joe Biden has obviously the early onset, early stages of dementia.

45
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.610
And not only is nobody saying anything about it,

46
00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:36.830
they're actively using him and go back,

47
00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:40.520
rewind the clip for 20 seconds from now and watch Jill bite.

48
00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:45.470
And she mouths Trump twice to him. She, she, this is elder abuse. I mean,

49
00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:48.590
she is abusing her husband and using him to attain power.

50
00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:50.540
That's what all of the DNC people are.

51
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.600
That's what everyone who's supporting Joe Biden doing. They are,

52
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.900
they are using this person who obviously is not capable,

53
00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:01.150
who has serious cognitive that it's miraculous. Yes.

54
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:02.380
I know what a bunch of you are going to say,

55
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:05.350
especially if you're more mainstream media type people, you're going to say, Oh,

56
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:08.890
but during the debates, he seems lucid. He seems cognizant. Yes, that's right.

57
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:12.400
They put him somewhere for four days. They shut him down.

58
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.230
I don't know if he's sleeping the entire time.

59
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:17.590
And then they have him snort some Adderall, or God knows what they're doing.

60
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.210
Something is not right.

61
00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:23.680
And you only see it if you pay attention to the news online.

62
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:27.400
And for now our ability to trade clips on YouTube and Twitter and everywhere

63
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:30.820
else, but who knows how much longer we'll have that ability. It's just,

64
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.210
I thought it was important to show that because this isn't just like some little

65
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.200
verbal gaffe, we all make verbal gaps. I speak live to a camera all the time.

66
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:40.060
I'm going to screw up a word here and there.

67
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.240
You're going to screw up a date or get, you know, forget something.

68
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:45.910
All of those things, like all of that is totally legit.

69
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.310
The man running for president literally could not remember the name of

70
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:55.270
his opponent, who happens to be the current president of the United States.

71
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.760
Okay. That is a problem,

72
00:03:57.761 --> 00:04:00.700
but you're not going to see it on CNN and you're not going to see it anywhere

73
00:04:00.701 --> 00:04:03.700
else. And I thought it was just worth just there it is.

74
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:06.700
There it's for you to decide, don't even listen to anything I'm saying about it.

75
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.640
Does that seem right to you? Yes or no. I guess that's the real question.

76
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.280
And then there was another clip going, making the rounds this weekend,

77
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:15.520
another one to buy it in. And by the way, before I even play this one,

78
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:17.080
I should say, that's not to say Trump,

79
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:20.440
doesn't say some funny things and odd things. And he has a strange way,

80
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:20.591
you know,

81
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:23.230
he starts talking and then he interrupts himself and then he kind of gets back

82
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:26.950
and reverses him. Cause he's doing a lot of stream of conscious stuff. Um,

83
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.700
which you know, that that's fine. It's partly what I do here. Right?

84
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:32.140
Like I don't really write much down.

85
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:33.850
I scribbled down a few things before we start.

86
00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:36.370
And then I just talked to you and sometimes you got a lot of thoughts in your

87
00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:38.290
head and you want to get to them and, and all that.

88
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:41.650
And I find that also as an interviewer, that's actually kind of fun.

89
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:44.530
When you see a guest who's really off, off the cuff,

90
00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:47.290
who's really exploring the stuff with you because they're not going into

91
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:50.470
pre-packaged things. But when you're truly off the cuff,

92
00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:52.930
you might be a little more prone to mistakes and things like that.

93
00:04:52.931 --> 00:04:54.370
That that's okay. Right.

94
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.420
<v 2>Or you might be a little more prone to too.</v>

95
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.270
<v 1>You're getting what you're saying. So there were times one more thing.</v>

96
00:05:00.271 --> 00:05:03.420
Then I'll get to this Biden clip. There were times when I was on tour with, uh,

97
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.300
Jordan Peterson and I would moderate the Q and a at the end.

98
00:05:06.301 --> 00:05:08.010
So we do about 45 minutes of Q and a.

99
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.520
This is after he's given an hour and a half lecture. We've traveled that day.

100
00:05:11.521 --> 00:05:14.370
He's done a ton of interviews, blah, blah, blah. And at the end,

101
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.530
I'd be asking questions that were from the crowd.

102
00:05:16.531 --> 00:05:20.430
Usually I'd pepper in some of my own questions. And he'd go on a long,

103
00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:22.440
long tangent on somebody else's question.

104
00:05:22.441 --> 00:05:25.860
And it's like 12 minutes later and I'm trying to listen to him so that I can

105
00:05:25.861 --> 00:05:29.880
then, you know, twist it into some other place that might be interesting. Right.

106
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.550
Could give it a little turn. That might be interesting for the crowd.

107
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.650
And then sometimes he would say, so what was the question? And I'd go, I'm not,

108
00:05:36.651 --> 00:05:38.670
I'm not even sure. And I'd have the audience yell it again,

109
00:05:38.671 --> 00:05:40.950
because if you're actually trying to listen, you might,

110
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.910
you might sort of forget some of this stuff. Okay. That's a total sidebar.

111
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.050
This next clip. Uh, this is just from the last couple of days. And, uh,

112
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.090
did Biden just admit something that we've all long suspected let's find out.

113
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:54.743
<v 2>Secondly,</v>

114
00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.690
we're in a situation where we had put and you guys

115
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.320
did it for our administrators, the president Obama's administration,

116
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.640
before this, we have put together, I think the most

117
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.220
extensive and inclusive voter fraud

118
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.750
organization in the history of American politics.

119
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.280
<v 1>All right. So let me just repeat that for, uh,</v>

120
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.470
I'm going to just cut that Obama part. Cause that was a little sidebar there.

121
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.820
We have put together,

122
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.380
I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud

123
00:06:32.381 --> 00:06:36.970
organization in the history of American politics. Now,

124
00:06:36.971 --> 00:06:39.130
I don't think he meant to say that. Obviously.

125
00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:42.490
I don't think he's admitting to a voting fraud organization.

126
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.990
Maybe there is a voting fraud organization and maybe it has something to do with

127
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.950
the DNC, but I don't even think he would know about that,

128
00:06:47.951 --> 00:06:49.840
but I'm not even going conspiracy level here.

129
00:06:49.841 --> 00:06:53.560
The point is that he said voter fraud organization,

130
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.230
and he didn't even know that he said it.

131
00:06:56.231 --> 00:07:00.220
He might've meant to say voter registration organization or some other thing

132
00:07:00.221 --> 00:07:04.570
like that. But it's the general confusion, the stammering, all of that stuff.

133
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.230
It's something it's not nothing. I,

134
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.470
my grandma had dementia. And when I was doing stand-up in New York,

135
00:07:11.471 --> 00:07:13.810
I was usually working at night. So I had some of my days free.

136
00:07:13.811 --> 00:07:17.230
And for about a year, I went off in several times a week to the doctor,

137
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.010
with her to various doctors actually. And I know what that's like,

138
00:07:21.011 --> 00:07:24.580
the confusion, the repetition, sometimes the anger, all of those things.

139
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.180
I am not doing this again to be glib or,

140
00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:31.870
or nonsensical or whatever. But the point is,

141
00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.460
if your friends are voting for bided, your family members are voting,

142
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.920
providing, and they don't see this stuff.

143
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:42.610
Like the simple truth is you're voting for Kamala Harris or whatever the machine

144
00:07:42.611 --> 00:07:46.900
is behind her. And let's not forget just, you know, what was it? Two weeks ago,

145
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.600
Pelosi was talking about the 25th amendment. I mean,

146
00:07:49.601 --> 00:07:54.220
that will be the plan to get rid of an incapacitated incapacitated,

147
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.690
Joe Biden. Like that is that, is it this, if he wins,

148
00:07:58.691 --> 00:08:01.810
he's going to go in a bunker they'll release statements every now and again,

149
00:08:01.811 --> 00:08:05.410
and try to get him out there just in the, the bare minimum. And then,

150
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.450
and then they'll just get rid of him. And Jill Biden should be embarrassed and,

151
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.380
and everyone behind this whole thing, um, it's just,

152
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.590
it's just painful. Anyway. I had to show you those two things,

153
00:08:17.591 --> 00:08:21.730
because otherwise they don't get, see, they don't get seen by people.

154
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.470
And then the reality war,

155
00:08:23.471 --> 00:08:26.560
as I'm always talking about just gets ramped up even more.

156
00:08:26.561 --> 00:08:30.850
So maybe share that with somebody that that's on the fence. And I don't know,

157
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.000
they can, they can make their own decision. All right, people, we got Tuesday,

158
00:08:34.001 --> 00:08:35.920
Wednesday, Thursday shows this week,

159
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.200
then we're going to do a bonus show on Friday.

160
00:08:38.201 --> 00:08:41.200
We may even do stuff over the weekend because obviously a lot's going to happen

161
00:08:41.201 --> 00:08:43.480
this week. Get out there as you can see.

162
00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:44.980
It's a little cool in Los Angeles today.

163
00:08:44.981 --> 00:08:48.520
I'm wearing a flannel for the first time in God knows how long, uh,

164
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.270
get out there, get some fresh air, take a walk. Don't go crazy.

165
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.050
<v 0>Tomorrow.</v>
