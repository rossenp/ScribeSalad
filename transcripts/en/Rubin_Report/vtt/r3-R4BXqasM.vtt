1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.200
<v 0>Trump was talking about a ban from China back in January, right?</v>

2
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.160
<v 1>Yeah. Um, he instituted the ban, I think, uh,</v>

3
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.150
31st of January, that's when the band actually happened.

4
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.870
But at the time the, who was saying that they shouldn't do it,

5
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.610
then you shouldn't restrict travel to China. And shortly after that,

6
00:00:22.611 --> 00:00:26.150
also the Chinese foreign ministry said that, um, that he,

7
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.880
they reacted very badly to Trump's ban saying that was,

8
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.950
it was racist and a phobic.

9
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.060
<v 0>So you mentioned the who, the world health organization and the CDC,</v>

10
00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:47.540
the center for disease control. It seems like in the last month,

11
00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:52.460
a messaging out of the who specifically has been just absolutely

12
00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:55.550
all over the place. And, you know, there's some people that say, Oh, well,

13
00:00:55.551 --> 00:00:57.560
they didn't want to push people into masks, sort of,

14
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.760
for the reasons you're saying,

15
00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:02.000
because then regular people who may be don't need them,

16
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.060
are going to get all the masks that people who need them, uh,

17
00:01:05.061 --> 00:01:07.850
won't have access to them. But have they,

18
00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:11.690
as an organization really just kind of flubbed this thing from the beginning.

19
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.990
<v 1>Yep, absolutely. Um, the w there's no question that the, who has,</v>

20
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.790
you know, basically abandoned its duties, um, in so many ways,

21
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:27.230
I mean, you can go all the way back to December. Um,

22
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.200
you, if you go back to December 30th,

23
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.880
that's when China first report it to the who, you know,

24
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.970
that there were these cases, uh, you know,

25
00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:42.710
a cluster of about 41 people that was the first time to report it. Um,

26
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.980
a day later on the 31st of January, new years,

27
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.720
Eve one basically said to the w H Oh,

28
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.620
Hey, we have heard that this is really serious.

29
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.630
And that there is human to human transmission. This was on the 31st of December.

30
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.190
And the reason Taiwan you about this was because there were Taiwanese doctors

31
00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:08.690
who had heard from their mainland colleagues that the medical staff in blue Han

32
00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:10.850
were getting sick. So that's how, you know,

33
00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:13.610
human to human transmission is occurring. It's when, you know,

34
00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:16.940
it's not animal to person, but person to person, is it,

35
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.070
the patients are transferring it to, to the doctors. So Taiwan reports this,

36
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.110
and it takes weeks before, you know,

37
00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:30.860
I think on the 14th of January, you still have that famous tweet by,

38
00:02:30.861 --> 00:02:35.630
by the who saying there still no evidence of human to human

39
00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:40.130
transmission two weeks after Taiwan told them that there was,

40
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.130
and this is, um,

41
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.810
been the story of how they've handled this they've Cal touts.

42
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.570
<v 0>Well, let's just, let's just pause there for one sec though.</v>

43
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.610
Let's just pause there for one sec. What is that like?

44
00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:56.150
What do you think structurally as someone that knows about organizations like

45
00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:58.340
this? Like what happened in those two weeks?

46
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.440
Were they intentionally misleading us? Did they just completely drop the ball?

47
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:06.010
Was there political pressure? Was it, Oh, they didn't want to be too alarmist.

48
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:08.140
I mean, is it some combination of all of those things?

49
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:10.171
<v 1>Um, no,</v>

50
00:03:10.171 --> 00:03:14.670
actually the problem is that Tai Taiwan doesn't have membership to the who.

51
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.510
So China has very successfully muscled Taiwan out.

52
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.520
So Taiwan is not recognized as a member and, and, you know, for Taiwan,

53
00:03:23.521 --> 00:03:26.280
that's very dangerous because, you know,

54
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.870
if you don't have that connection to the who you are not plugged into this

55
00:03:30.871 --> 00:03:35.520
global health alert system and the global health alert system is not plugged

56
00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:39.570
into Taiwan. So whatever Intel Taiwan had was completely missed.

57
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.540
Um, and then the worst part for Taiwan is that because China basically muscled

58
00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:50.310
them out when all the other countries were placing travel bands, um,

59
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.410
they were trying to ban Chinese, uh,

60
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.390
people from China traveling to their countries.

61
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.040
They inadvertently banned Taiwan because Taiwan was seen as pulp China,

62
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.600
which is what China wants.

63
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.220
<v 3>Okay. So.</v>

64
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.770
<v 0>The who drops the ball and then we've subsequently seen some other strange</v>

65
00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:14.100
tweets and we've seen some, some strange statements by,

66
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.740
by some of their representatives. Um,

67
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.060
Trump was talking about a ban from China back in January, right?

68
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.873
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

69
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.040
<v 1>Um, he instituted the ban, I think, uh, 31st of January,</v>

70
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.550
that's when the band actually happened. But at the time the,

71
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.770
who was saying that they shouldn't do it,

72
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.480
then you shouldn't restrict travel to China. And shortly after that,

73
00:04:39.481 --> 00:04:43.020
also the Chinese foreign ministry said that, um, that he,

74
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.750
they reacted very badly to Trump's ban saying that was,

75
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.920
it was racist and xenophobic, um, to Institute the ban.

76
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.670
<v 0>Yeah. Surprise, surprise. So what, what do you make of the fact that now,</v>

77
00:04:53.671 --> 00:04:56.310
because hindsight is 2020, people are saying, Oh,

78
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.340
Trump didn't do anything in February.

79
00:04:59.341 --> 00:05:02.130
Everyone knew that this was going to happen. Trump didn't do anything.

80
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.770
I checked yesterday. And it turns out that do you know,

81
00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:09.360
there was a democratic debate on February. I think it's seventh, 19th and 25th.

82
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.570
None of those debates mentioned anything about Corona virus,

83
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.470
oddly yet the media is now telling us that everybody was talking about all of

84
00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:20.100
this stuff in February. Um, could,

85
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.310
could he have done more? Should he have done more?

86
00:05:23.311 --> 00:05:28.290
How do you balance keeping people sane and keeping the economy open versus a

87
00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:30.210
potential looming threat? All of that.

88
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.961
<v 1>I mean, he,</v>

89
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:36.120
he did suggest that he was somewhat distracted by the impeachment proceedings.

90
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.130
And for the whole month of February,

91
00:05:38.131 --> 00:05:43.050
you didn't have our journalist class doing one of two things saying

92
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.740
that this was just, you know, kind of the flu, just nothing,

93
00:05:46.741 --> 00:05:51.220
just another flu or warning people about, you know, that,

94
00:05:51.221 --> 00:05:55.110
that the stigma against Asian Americans were, was worse than the virus itself.

95
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.920
And so even on the, of February,

96
00:05:57.921 --> 00:06:02.900
you had the health officials in New York city saying come out for a lunar new

97
00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:07.520
year parade. Everything's okay. Life is normal, you know, stand up,

98
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.480
no phobia and racism. So they were still acting as if, um,

99
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.250
understandably a lot of people miss this. Um, you know, it's okay,

100
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.990
let's all just party and mix and, and, you know, stand in defiance to,

101
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.850
to this, uh, to this virus. So a lot of people miss it,

102
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.870
I read yesterday that on the 29th of January,

103
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.940
that peanut Navarro, who is the trade official in, in Trump's cabinet,

104
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.820
um, actually wrote a memo warning and saying that this virus is the real deal.

105
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.740
And this is going to be, you know,

106
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.970
at worst 2 million deaths at best a hundred thousand, but we got to act on it.

107
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.980
And, uh, he proposed actually a travel ban, Trump that he didn't read the memo,

108
00:06:51.981 --> 00:06:54.470
but shortly after on the 31st, he actually,

109
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.180
he actually did put down the travel ban. Um, that's one of the, you know,

110
00:06:59.181 --> 00:07:02.960
the good things about Trump is that he didn't really care about that. And this,

111
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.330
this virus actually really fit in well with his ideological priors, you know,

112
00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:11.720
for being conservative on immigration, um,

113
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.600
and being a bit more nationalistic in terms of,

114
00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:18.050
of trade and engagement America first.

115
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:19.043
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

116
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:24.130
Can you talk a little bit about just like the inner machinations of China,

117
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.020
because right now it's like,

118
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.330
just in the last few days we've seen this thing where, you know,

119
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:33.250
us cases are spiking, but China is reporting no new cases,

120
00:07:33.251 --> 00:07:36.190
no new debts. And it's like, all right, well just be,

121
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.040
and then NBC news will literally make that statement.

122
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.740
The AP will make that statement and it's like, well,

123
00:07:41.741 --> 00:07:43.450
I guess that's sort of reporting.

124
00:07:43.451 --> 00:07:45.520
And that you're reporting what China's reporting,

125
00:07:45.521 --> 00:07:47.950
but that's not really independent reporting. Like,

126
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.300
can you just talk a little bit about how,

127
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.600
how information can or can't travel in China?

128
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:57.820
<v 1>Well, you know, the media's job is to be skeptical and towards that end,</v>

129
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.730
they are very skeptical when it comes to reporting about the Trump

130
00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:01.564
administration,

131
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:07.270
but they're not affording that same approach to the Chinese government. When,

132
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.850
if all people who you shouldn't be skeptical about,

133
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:15.040
it should be numbers that are coming off a very closed society.

134
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.760
Um, and you know, I don't think,

135
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.820
I think China has had a history of covering up numbers in general.

136
00:08:21.821 --> 00:08:26.740
People are very skeptical about even numbers coming out from their

137
00:08:26.741 --> 00:08:29.470
GDP calculations. Um,

138
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.820
how they miraculously always meet exactly 6%

139
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.670
target like exact. Um,

140
00:08:36.671 --> 00:08:41.440
so we have the history of hiding things and the fact that they had

141
00:08:41.441 --> 00:08:45.550
no qualms suppressing the whistleblower censoring, their,

142
00:08:45.551 --> 00:08:50.260
their social media, um, Y you know, why wouldn't they,

143
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.460
we not assume that they're, they're covering up their, their numbers.

144
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.480
<v 0>So if we can't trust the numbers that we're getting out of China, and sadly,</v>

145
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:04.740
we can't really trust our own media to report on it properly rather than just

146
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:05.880
regurgitate the numbers.

147
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.080
How do we get some sensible information out of China?

148
00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.690
Is there a way to do it that you can truly trust?

149
00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.640
<v 1>Well, you know, the CIA,</v>

150
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:21.590
apparently they be submitted classified report to the

151
00:09:21.591 --> 00:09:23.660
white palace now Bloomberg reported on it.

152
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.330
And they actually basically said that they were trying to verify China's numbers

153
00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.180
and we won't be able to. So, you know,

154
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:37.220
apart from intelligence agencies or using some sort of

155
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:38.870
proxy, um,

156
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:43.430
I think a lot of people saw these videos that were circulated in social media,

157
00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.310
um, all the origins that were, you know,

158
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:51.020
going to funeral homes and seem to match up with,

159
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:55.130
with, uh, what was recorded. Um,

160
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.240
probably a lot of these videos once they get posted by citizen journalists

161
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.650
ended up, you know, they ended up getting taken down class.

162
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:09.050
So information out of China. And I mean,

163
00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:11.630
