1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.720
<v 0>But 5g is going to be tremendous a hundred times faster speeds and 4g,</v>

2
00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:05.760
if not quicker than that much lower latency,

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.560
quicker responsiveness of the network,

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.530
and also all kinds of applications we can't even dream of.

5
00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:12.000
So we're just in the early stages right now,

6
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.850
the wireless carriers are doing some deployments in major cities,

7
00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:15.990
including Los Angeles.

8
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:18.300
And we're hopeful that that's going to ramp up in the future.

9
00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:21.330
I think we're going to have 92 commercial deployments across the country by the

10
00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:22.164
end of this year.

11
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.170
<v 1>So what's happening with 5g right now,</v>

12
00:00:27.171 --> 00:00:31.190
because I think now in LA it's in certain spots, I am seeing 5g.

13
00:00:31.191 --> 00:00:33.140
It just pops up on my phone. And I remember, you know,

14
00:00:33.141 --> 00:00:35.870
I was traveling a lot in the last year that certain cities I would get it and

15
00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:37.700
I'd be like, Whoa, I didn't even know this was a thing.

16
00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:41.180
So how does that actually work when you guys are trying to build a nationwide

17
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.840
network?

18
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.190
<v 0>Yeah. So 5g is going to be tremendous a hundred times faster speeds and 4g,</v>

19
00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:49.580
if not quicker than that much lower latency and quicker responsiveness of the

20
00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:52.970
network and also all kinds of applications we can't even dream of.

21
00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:54.470
So we're just in the early stages right now,

22
00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:57.320
the wireless carriers are doing some deployments in major cities,

23
00:00:57.321 --> 00:00:58.460
including Los Angeles.

24
00:00:58.461 --> 00:01:00.740
And we're hopeful that that's going to ramp up in the future.

25
00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:03.440
I think we're going to have 92 commercial deployments across the country,

26
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.690
by the end of this year, many more are coming.

27
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.500
And so our goal is to put the building blocks in place for companies to innovate

28
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.610
that involves spectrum.

29
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:12.800
We're getting a lot more spectrum into the commercial marketplace,

30
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.130
held a big auction in January. Another one finished up in may.

31
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.670
Biggest auction in American history is going to be on December 10th and this

32
00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:20.121
year alone,

33
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:22.970
we're going to push more spectrum in the commercial marketplace and just held by

34
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.790
every mobile broadband provider combined when it came to office.

35
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.030
And so huge influx of supply on the infrastructure side too.

36
00:01:29.031 --> 00:01:32.330
We're modernizing our rules to recognize that small cells essentially

37
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.200
infrastructure.

38
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.840
That's no bigger than say that basketball shouldn't have to jump through the

39
00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:38.300
same regulatory hoops as a 200 foot cell tower.

40
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.480
And that's the kind of thing that has real pop here in LA in particular,

41
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.501
just yesterday morning,

42
00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:45.860
I was visiting a site where they're deploying these small cells in a lower

43
00:01:45.861 --> 00:01:46.760
income neighborhood.

44
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.180
Thanks in part to the regulatory streamlining that we've done and the city of

45
00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:52.970
LA, believe it or not as done, they have now had the real,

46
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.130
the city of Bay is helping. I've got to say,

47
00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:57.440
mayor Garcetti has been a terrific partner on this issue.

48
00:01:57.441 --> 00:02:00.470
Other cities have raised, uh, a little, few more roadblocks,

49
00:02:00.471 --> 00:02:03.620
but those cities that are forward thinking that want their citizens to benefit

50
00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:07.820
from 5g or adopting this more modern approach to infrastructure deployment.

51
00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:10.850
So overall I think the United States is poised to lead,

52
00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:11.870
but there are other countries too,

53
00:02:11.871 --> 00:02:14.630
particularly China that would love to seize the lead for themselves.

54
00:02:14.631 --> 00:02:16.760
And so we're in an implicit competition, I think,

55
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:18.350
with many countries and regions around the world.

56
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.510
<v 1>Yeah. So right before we started,</v>

57
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.750
we talked about this issue with how China deals with regulation differently and

58
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.570
their, their strengths and weaknesses to it. Can you explain that a bit?

59
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.230
Cause I think it's,

60
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.680
it's a really fascinating flip on the way we talk about a lot of these issues.

61
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.840
<v 0>So China of course, is not a democracy. Uh, Beijing can dictate, uh,</v>

62
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.510
not just what policy priorities the government should follow,

63
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:42.740
but also require all provinces, all localities to fall into line.

64
00:02:42.741 --> 00:02:43.760
And so of course,

65
00:02:43.761 --> 00:02:47.090
since they don't observe the same democratic niceties we do and this case,

66
00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:49.580
they can simply feel that we want to lead the world in 5g.

67
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.430
That means we're going to pick the companies that create the equipment and

68
00:02:52.431 --> 00:02:53.264
subsidize them.

69
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.270
We're going to make sure that our wireless carriers can deploy at scale and they

70
00:02:56.271 --> 00:02:58.040
don't have to jump through these regulatory hoops.

71
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.140
And we are otherwise going to take the steps necessary to free up spectrum and

72
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:04.390
do the other things necessary for 5g success.

73
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.110
So that kind of sounds good at some level. Right, right. But there are,

74
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:11.920
of course, some concerns for those who shared democratic values,

75
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:14.350
such as the United States comparatively here,

76
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.690
we have not just federal regulatory approval,

77
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:19.180
that's required state and local regulatory approval.

78
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.350
That's required in many cases,

79
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:24.670
but also under a long-standing system that the FCC set up many years ago, uh,

80
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.170
any one of the 573 federally recognized Indian tribes also can have a bite at

81
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:30.190
the regulatory Apple.

82
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:34.270
So one of the points I've made is that let's try to modernize that framework to

83
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:36.280
say that there's a consistent level of regulation,

84
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.840
especially if you're a smaller company,

85
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:41.320
you don't have the lawyers and accountants and appliance officers to jump

86
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:43.600
through all of these four different layers of review.

87
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.110
And to the extent that capital is scarce and work crews don't have to be hired

88
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:48.280
in networks. Don't have to be built.

89
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.270
I don't want that innovative spirit to be directed to other parts of the world

90
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:54.070
where you can deploy at scale.

91
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:56.560
And that's part of the reason why we've been trying to work with localities like

92
00:03:56.561 --> 00:03:58.420
LA to update that framework,

93
00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:01.390
to make it more streamlined and E just easier and cheaper to build these

94
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:02.224
networks.

95
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.660
<v 1>Well, China can just say, all right,</v>

96
00:04:03.661 --> 00:04:07.260
we're doing this and no local province can do anything about it.

97
00:04:07.261 --> 00:04:09.420
And while that may work for now,

98
00:04:09.421 --> 00:04:12.270
like it may make the process faster for now while you have to deal with the

99
00:04:12.271 --> 00:04:14.520
local States and all that in the longterm,

100
00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:18.120
it probably hurts their ability to innovate because it's all coming from the

101
00:04:18.121 --> 00:04:21.870
top, right? You guys have more of a slog to fight through now,

102
00:04:21.871 --> 00:04:23.760
but the hope is that you're creating the,

103
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.870
the groundwork sort of to allow as much competition as possible that through the

104
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.130
cell companies basically.

105
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.330
<v 0>Exactly right.</v>

106
00:04:30.331 --> 00:04:33.510
And you're part of the reason why I want this regulatory modernization is not

107
00:04:33.511 --> 00:04:36.720
just to be able to compete with other countries, but also because we recognize,

108
00:04:36.721 --> 00:04:39.810
and this is one of the truths that hardly ever gets recognized in Washington,

109
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.560
that heavy handed regulation and multiple levels of regulation

110
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.320
disproportionately affect smaller companies.

111
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.650
It's the larger companies that don't have the compliance rates that have the

112
00:04:49.651 --> 00:04:52.440
compliance resources that can jump through a lot of these hoops. Sure.

113
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.380
It will cost them money, but they actually have the resources to comply.

114
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.810
We don't want to squeeze out some of the smaller competitors.

115
00:04:57.811 --> 00:04:59.400
And especially in the technology space,

116
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.070
we're trying to encourage a lot more companies to enter this space.

117
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.970
We haven't talked about space itself yet satellite companies and fixed wireless

118
00:05:05.971 --> 00:05:07.650
companies. And some of these newer companies,

119
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.840
they might not be able to get off the ground.

120
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.210
If that regulatory framework is so onerous that they can't raise capital,

121
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.100
they can't hire the lawyers and they can never deploy a product.

122
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.761
<v 1>Yeah. All right.</v>

123
00:05:17.761 --> 00:05:20.880
So I'm obviously gonna want to spend a lot more time talking about the pure tech

124
00:05:20.881 --> 00:05:23.850
side of this and the Silicon Valley side, which is not, as you said,

125
00:05:23.851 --> 00:05:26.700
everyone thinks it's sort of your job, but it's not quite your job, but wait,

126
00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:29.220
let's just do the space thing for a minute because it's really interesting

127
00:05:29.221 --> 00:05:34.050
because it quite literally is the next frontier, if not the final frontier,

128
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.670
how in the world do you sit down with people and you know, you have,

129
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.910
you have government people now trying to, uh,

130
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.120
deal with the ideas that Elon Musk and all of these people are coming in with.

131
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.520
We're privatizing a lot of the space stuff.

132
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.140
How do you even come to a basic place where you can say, well, you can,

133
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.770
you can kind of do this and I want you to be free, but we can't totally do that.

134
00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:58.010
I mean, how does that conversation even it's, it's.

135
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.170
<v 0>Fascinating. First of all, it's just intellectually fascinating to me.</v>

136
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:02.450
I've always loved space. And, uh, the,

137
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:05.900
the innovation that's happening in space right now is just unprecedented.

138
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:06.200
I mean,

139
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.400
the launches they're able to do using reusable rockets have really decreased the

140
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:12.760
cost element to launching these things into space.

141
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.240
<v 1>I literally sent a Tesla into just, just cause he could do it.</v>

142
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.480
You know what I mean? Like you didn't have a regulation around that,

143
00:06:19.481 --> 00:06:22.030
that you can just send a car into space. There was no, you didn't want to.

144
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.430
Yeah, no, it didn't fall within our purview, but yeah.

145
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.420
<v 0>Things do fall within our purview.</v>

146
00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:31.750
So over the last two and a half years that we were the first administration to

147
00:06:31.751 --> 00:06:35.710
approve what are called non geostationary, satellite orbit, constellations,

148
00:06:35.711 --> 00:06:36.370
NGSS,

149
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.220
but essentially a lot of satellites that are being launched by companies like

150
00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:43.690
space X and one web, and probably Kuyper Amazon in the future. Uh,

151
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.750
hundreds, if not thousands of these satellites in low earth, orbits,

152
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:47.800
not deep into space,

153
00:06:47.801 --> 00:06:51.700
but lower in the earth orbit so that they can beam internet access services at a

154
00:06:51.701 --> 00:06:54.520
speed and a price point that would be comparable to what you would get from a

155
00:06:54.521 --> 00:06:55.630
terrestrial provider.

156
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.300
And my position here is very reflective of those principles.

157
00:06:58.301 --> 00:07:01.540
We talked about from the beginning instead of preemptively regulating, deciding,

158
00:07:01.541 --> 00:07:05.260
okay, you can launch, but all of you now, we're not going to let you do it.

159
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.480
Trying to pick a business case or a business plan.

160
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.420
That's going to work and letting them take the first crack.

161
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.190
We're taking a more market-based approach.

162
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.340
Let's allow all of them to launch in various stages,

163
00:07:15.341 --> 00:07:18.280
using certain parameters for orbital safety and whatnot.

164
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.530
And we'll see what happens. Let's let the market,

165
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.010
the aggravated decisions of consumers decide which one will succeed.

166
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.660
And some of them might, you never know,

167
00:07:25.661 --> 00:07:28.690
it could be a residential broadband product. Some of them are very different.

168
00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:30.580
They want to do industrial internet of things.

169
00:07:30.581 --> 00:07:33.640
I met recently with a company that just wants to deploy 150 satellites around

170
00:07:33.641 --> 00:07:36.280
the globe and they want to sign up customers. Like you say,

171
00:07:36.281 --> 00:07:37.140
the department of defense,

172
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.620
it has a military all around the world and they just need essentially low

173
00:07:41.621 --> 00:07:45.160
bandwidth services just to let people know where the troops are at any given

174
00:07:45.161 --> 00:07:48.450
point in time. W we want all of them to be able to succeed in space.

175
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.630
<v 1>You don't really think about the orbital safety portion of this as you just</v>

176
00:07:52.631 --> 00:07:55.240
mentioned, but so that's just like, no matter what happens,

177
00:07:55.241 --> 00:07:58.120
you guys almost always need another office to open, right. I mean,

178
00:07:58.121 --> 00:07:59.980
is that sort of how it works? Because you're like, all right,

179
00:07:59.981 --> 00:08:02.260
I want them to put the satellites up there.

180
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.140
We want to get people internet as fast as possible and as cheap as possible,

181
00:08:05.141 --> 00:08:07.630
it's all good. And then someone probably walks in. It's like, you know,

182
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.660
we got to make sure these satellites aren't crashing into each other and then

183
00:08:10.661 --> 00:08:13.120
you have to, what do you do? You do another study? I mean, do you,

184
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.820
what are you mapping out there? Even? That's a good question. So that's a,

185
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:16.660
it goes to the.

186
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.400
<v 0>Early question. Yeah. So what if there were no regulations?</v>

187
00:08:18.401 --> 00:08:20.710
So here is where I think there is a base level of regulation.

188
00:08:20.711 --> 00:08:22.870
That's really important, especially in the space environment,

189
00:08:22.871 --> 00:08:25.560
for those of you who saw gravity. I mean, Sandra Bullock.

190
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.081
<v 1>Right? Right.</v>

191
00:08:26.081 --> 00:08:28.600
We can't have these things just spinning around lacking each other. Exactly.

192
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.940
<v 0>Well, because that stuff lasts for thousands of thousands of years,</v>

193
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.190
especially if they don't descend in the atmosphere and burn up.

194
00:08:33.191 --> 00:08:36.070
And so we want to make sure that that space environment is safe for everybody.

195
00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:39.070
And so one of the things I kicked off about a year ago, let's see,

196
00:08:39.071 --> 00:08:42.730
how should we update our orbital debris rules? They were first adopted in 2004,

197
00:08:42.731 --> 00:08:45.040
but back then, we didn't have a lot of satellites up in space.

198
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.340
We're talking about a lot more stuff in space. And so accordingly,

199
00:08:48.341 --> 00:08:50.380
I think our Overdale debris rules need to be updated.

200
00:08:50.381 --> 00:08:53.350
So we're in the middle of conversation now about how should we think about

201
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.400
updating those rules requiring companies to be safe, uh,

202
00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:00.420
should they have to deorbit on a certain schedule? You set certain technology,

203
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:01.254
that kind of things.

204
00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.690
<v 1>You'd prefer that everything has some sort of like time limit up there or</v>

205
00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:06.051
something.

206
00:09:06.051 --> 00:09:10.910
So that eventually that it doesn't just become space garbage in

207
00:09:10.911 --> 00:09:12.800
Futurama or something. Exactly.

208
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.110
<v 0>The things we're thinking about is should there be a time limit,</v>

209
00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:16.760
should there be a built-in technology?

210
00:09:16.761 --> 00:09:19.670
So some of these satellites can deorbit automatically after a certain period of

211
00:09:19.671 --> 00:09:23.030
time, or if there is a failure, they will automatically deorbit, uh,

212
00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.141
things like that.

213
00:09:24.141 --> 00:09:27.650
And so ultimately we want to make sure that everybody's can succeed in space in

214
00:09:27.651 --> 00:09:31.700
the long run. We don't want to, like I said, in any of these orbital slots,

215
00:09:31.701 --> 00:09:34.130
if you have debris, that's a generational problem.

216
00:09:34.131 --> 00:09:35.600
Not just a multi-year problem.

217
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.870
<v 1>How much of this is sort of long-term thinking,</v>

218
00:09:38.871 --> 00:09:42.020
say the way you would talk about the climate change situation.

219
00:09:42.021 --> 00:09:46.160
So it's sort of like, you can, you can plot a certain degree,

220
00:09:46.161 --> 00:09:48.890
but no matter how much you plot other countries, I mean,

221
00:09:48.891 --> 00:09:49.820
you just referenced China.

222
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.880
Other countries are just going to do things the way they want and how

223
00:09:52.881 --> 00:09:54.350
complicated that makes your job.

224
00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:59.240
It's meaning you could do everything exactly right. Perfectly right. And still,

225
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.120
if some other country decides to do whatever they want and you still,

226
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.380
you still have all of those problems.

227
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:04.910
<v 0>It's that is a problem.</v>

228
00:10:04.911 --> 00:10:07.550
So there is a lot of international coordination that has to happen,

229
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.990
especially when it comes to orbital debris.

230
00:10:08.991 --> 00:10:12.410
We're always working with some of the other countries agencies to make sure that

231
00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:13.340
we're all on the same page.

232
00:10:13.341 --> 00:10:17.120
And there are international organizations that deal specifically with this in

233
00:10:17.121 --> 00:10:19.910
fact, shortly coming up and Egypt, there's a big, uh,

234
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.430
quadrennial every four years, they have this conference and, uh,

235
00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.210
to talk about spectrum issues. And, uh, one of the issues is, uh,

236
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.910
what spectrum should be available for satellite companies. And, uh,

237
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:29.961
so in that context,

238
00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:33.500
we're always talking about being on the same page on things like orbital debris

239
00:10:33.501 --> 00:10:34.970
and, and spectrum allocation.

240
00:10:34.971 --> 00:10:37.670
But I think you raise a really good point is that we could do everything

241
00:10:37.671 --> 00:10:38.151
correctly,

242
00:10:38.151 --> 00:10:41.810
but other countries are looking to take the lead on things like artificial

243
00:10:41.811 --> 00:10:44.840
intelligence, machine learning, or blockchain or quantum computing.

244
00:10:44.841 --> 00:10:49.190
And we don't have jurisdiction over all of it. But to the extent we can,

245
00:10:49.191 --> 00:10:52.190
we want to make sure we advance the U S leadership because I do think that there

246
00:10:52.191 --> 00:10:57.020
are some first mover advantages to countries and to sectors that really show

247
00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:58.760
that they're willing to take the lead.

248
00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.790
