00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.070
<v 0>Jim Acosta was sitting 10 feet from me and he bad mouth me saying I</v>

2
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:09.810
was a PR stunt that I did that he played me directly a

3
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:12.060
PR stunt to get to promote my pillow.

4
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.400
This is what happened last week. So we got a little rerun here. I mean,

5
00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:29.810
I never thought that my popular fame could grow any

6
00:00:29.811 --> 00:00:33.140
bigger, you know, whatever, infamous fan, whatever you want to call it.

7
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.220
But I get, I start making masks. I converted my whole company,

8
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.170
75% over to make a cloth mask. And it was quite a project.

9
00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:45.350
We had to train all employees, but we did it in like four games.

10
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.020
<v 2>Can you just explain a little bit about how you do that? I mean,</v>

11
00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:51.890
did you have to bring in experts to change machines? I mean.

12
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.380
<v 0>I made a call to the vice president's office.</v>

13
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.640
I actually an email and they sent me right away to Peter Navarro and,

14
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.790
and whenever he was running, I didn't know who Peter Navarro was.

15
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.170
And then he emailed me right back and he directed me to a task force.

16
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.070
They had already set up in a little coalition about anybody that was all these

17
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:13.910
different things from mass to go into whatever kind of like let's set this up so

18
00:01:13.911 --> 00:01:17.630
people can have their questions answered. So I called them the first question.

19
00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:20.090
I said, what are the, what are the measurements? Uh,

20
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.280
is there a restriction that I have to know about?

21
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.640
Because obviously I have to worry about getting sued by frivolous lawyers in

22
00:01:25.641 --> 00:01:30.230
California. Let's not forget that. So I had to make sure everything was,

23
00:01:30.231 --> 00:01:34.430
you know, was right in the meantime, I already said I'm doing this. So my,

24
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.540
my employees, they're very good at scaling. I've had some of the same team.

25
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.320
We're like a big family. We just started going. We took the sewing machines,

26
00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:45.980
moved them, made them eight feet apart. Um, we had to, um,

27
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:47.870
and to move wracking,

28
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.380
we had to make sure that I had to make sure that we had the right fabric.

29
00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:54.680
It was a blessing. The, my pillow fabric was perfect for it.

30
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.100
We just had to not do two processes of printing and other thing.

31
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.490
So we had to do a different process, but it wasn't a big switch.

32
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.720
And then I had to get a Lastic. I first I bought the wrong elastic and latex.

33
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.030
So I had to dump that, get the right elastic.

34
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.590
There was a low shortage for one day,

35
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.820
but I was determined I was going to get it. And then we, uh, we had a biggest,

36
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.030
really expensive cutting machines so we can cut the patterns.

37
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.760
And we were up and making masks in three days,

38
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.830
everyone was training their uncle get close to 10,000 the first day.

39
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.360
And we, we w we added two shifts or friend of mine. We slot them,

40
00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:31.610
had to be laundry. The commercial line, man. We just,

41
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.090
I was up til 12 every day setting. The foundation is till midnight,

42
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.100
starting again at five in the morning. Well,

43
00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:40.940
then I get an email from the vice president's office and said,

44
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.410
could you come out to do and being involved in a round table,

45
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.520
like I was involved in when the 2017 first time I was ever in the white house

46
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.730
and for me to be in America, well, they said,

47
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.630
we'd like you to help rate some remarks and I'm gone, okay.

48
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.460
They got to get approval. I'm going, what do I need for a round table for?

49
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.120
So I actually, the remarks are here and these are the type ones here.

50
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.200
These are the type remarks. Okay. So I type them up and send them out there.

51
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:09.880
And I wasn't even real particular.

52
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.230
They wanted remarks of what we were doing and a print specifically about what my

53
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:17.920
pillow was doing. I'm going okay. I don't really, you know, that's fine.

54
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:20.680
I don't really need to brag about what I'm doing to help the country,

55
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.430
but I'll do it. You know, it sits in a round table. And, uh,

56
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:26.350
so I fly out there.

57
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.340
We get to the round table and there's all the five CEOs that are there.

58
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.550
The vice president, a couple of guys down at the end,

59
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.360
I forget who they were and we're we go around the table and each one, well,

60
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:41.320
this one's doing respirators and this one's. And I said, we're doing mask. And,

61
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.190
but I wasn't looking, nobody was looking at their remarks or whatever.

62
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.260
I didn't even see any papers out and I'm going.

63
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:50.650
So then the president came in and this is a good half hour of everyone saying

64
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:53.980
what they're doing, but you guys were, you know, can you make more, uh,

65
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.040
you know, what you, what do you plan? What are your plans? And, and, uh,

66
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.800
we get down to the president, gets up and they all get up.

67
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:02.980
And I said to the vice president, I said, we didn't read our remarks. He goes,

68
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.660
Oh, no, no, they're outside of the president might call you up to them. Really.

69
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.430
So now we go into the other room towards the oval office and the

70
00:04:12.431 --> 00:04:16.750
president he's showing the other CEOs, you kind of get a little mini tour here.

71
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.110
And then he sits down and he's got to read his speech with the vice president.

72
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.770
And we're sitting over here at this table. And I thought, you know what,

73
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.110
I'm reading the remarks. I go, you know what?

74
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:28.180
I want to give a message of hope to the people.

75
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.140
And so I start writing on the back and, uh, you know,

76
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.620
if you can see my scribbles, there's little arrows that go down and stuff,

77
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.640
we wrote it. I thought I would rewrite it on a clean piece of paper.

78
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.280
I just get done with the last thing. I mean,

79
00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:44.650
there's crossed out and everything and they go, okay,

80
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:49.120
we're going out to the Rose garden and I'm going, what? Now? I'm running. Okay.

81
00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:53.380
So all I said was, God, please let me read my writing. That's all I

82
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.830
heard out. The president calls me up first. I mean, I came right up.

83
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:03.250
We knew practices. So I didn't know we were all going to go around the end.

84
00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:05.290
So he called me up person. I went straight up.

85
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.890
So I think they held the other CEO's back. So it was just him and I,

86
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.290
and here's a guy that has so much nervousness of speaking. Now I did,

87
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.540
uh, my, um, my throat. I've had,

88
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.370
I had vocal cord surgery just a week before I was a little raspy, like I am now.

89
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.340
And, uh, and I get up there and I read them and then I just felt, you know,

90
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.690
let it get turned around. I said, Mr. President,

91
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:31.870
you mind if I read something off the cuff now? And he said, yes.

92
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.880
And then I read the guy, you know,

93
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.680
God gave us grace on November 18th or November eight, 2016. Um,

94
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.770
you know, I just read that they don't talk to about that. We, uh,

95
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.000
the nation had turned his back on God and we should spend his time and,

96
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.320
you know, reading the Bibles,

97
00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:50.920
getting back on the word and spending time with our families. And I said,

98
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:54.220
we're all going to get through this with this great administration and

99
00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:57.070
everybody's prayers and everybody combined, we're all in this.

100
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.020
And we're going to be stronger and safer than ever.

101
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.210
You would have think I shot somebody.

102
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.550
<v 2>So, so you do all this it's impromptu.</v>

103
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.530
He's letting you do your thing. You talk about God, you're, you're,

104
00:06:13.531 --> 00:06:17.470
you're making, I think at one point you were making 50,000 masks a day, right?

105
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.170
Yeah. You're doing doing that right now. So you finish, you finish the speech.

106
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.400
And did you even think about it or realize what was about to come your way?

107
00:06:27.401 --> 00:06:28.600
Like, did it even cross your mind?

108
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.500
<v 0>No. Do you know what? It was just, it was like, to me it didn't feel that,</v>

109
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.190
you know, it didn't, I didn't think it would be a shot heard round the world.

110
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.420
And, uh, we won't,

111
00:06:37.421 --> 00:06:41.560
we went back into the white house and the first inkling I got that it might be

112
00:06:41.561 --> 00:06:45.040
real big was the vice president came to me and he goes,

113
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.120
he was just wildlife. You know, he goes, you've opened up the, you know,

114
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.880
opened up the habits. I mean, people are gonna, you know, you're just,

115
00:06:51.881 --> 00:06:54.700
it was just, I don't even remember what he said, but he was just,

116
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.010
I could just tell, he just loved it. I'm going good.

117
00:06:57.011 --> 00:06:59.410
I got a little confirmation that it was okay. You know,

118
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.870
the president never said a thing about it. You know,

119
00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:06.550
he was talking to the CEOs and us and, and um, we go to, when I,

120
00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.020
when I left the white house, I finally, you got my phone back. See,

121
00:07:11.021 --> 00:07:12.550
they have your phones. Right.

122
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.240
And I open up my phone and turn it on.

123
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:20.620
I had 750 text messages.

124
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.700
I didn't know that many people had my phone number and I'm going,

125
00:07:24.701 --> 00:07:28.030
what did happen? I looked at Twitter and there's thousands was,

126
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:34.060
I looked at my peace book. It had blown up. I had 2000 emails. I mean,

127
00:07:34.061 --> 00:07:37.330
it was just, and I'm trying to drive and get to him going. Well,

128
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.660
I had to pull over. I was just gone. I call him Prince. I go, what happened?

129
00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:44.440
They go, don't, you know, everybody's talking about it and I'm going really.

130
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.590
And, uh, so for that point I have,

131
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.610
I've done 80 some interviews as of today, every day, all day,

132
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:56.080
I've gotten calls from Israel, my friends in Australia,

133
00:07:56.081 --> 00:07:59.530
they said it was on top of all the news in the timeline paper.

134
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.160
It was the cover of their national paper. This was like, you think it was,

135
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.770
and you know, one of the good things there's there.

136
00:08:05.771 --> 00:08:10.360
I'm glad I asked the president because, um, the, everybody knew he had no idea.

137
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:14.020
You know, he had no ideas. So, you know, people that said, Oh,

138
00:08:14.021 --> 00:08:18.370
you're mixing church and state or church in God or whatever God got in into

139
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.060
government. You know what? I did that. So what are you going to do?

140
00:08:22.061 --> 00:08:24.100
Put me in jail. Sorry. Right.

141
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.210
<v 2>Well, you didn't, you also,</v>

142
00:08:25.211 --> 00:08:28.450
didn't the government didn't force anyone to listen to you.

143
00:08:28.451 --> 00:08:31.600
People could either hear you and, and, and believe,

144
00:08:31.601 --> 00:08:35.050
or enjoy what you say or not. So be it. Um, but now, okay.

145
00:08:35.051 --> 00:08:37.330
But now talk about just the media reaction,

146
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.330
cause I'm sure you're getting a lot of love from, from nice quarters.

147
00:08:40.331 --> 00:08:42.670
And it must be nice to hear the, vice-president say some nice things,

148
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:43.990
but really, I mean, I, you know,

149
00:08:43.991 --> 00:08:47.340
I was watching it as it happened on Twitter and the amount of,

150
00:08:47.341 --> 00:08:50.740
of main stream media people.

151
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:55.770
Who've never donated a dollar given up any of their time. There, all the,

152
00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:59.910
my pillow guy mocking you, uh, mocking Trump for bringing you on.

153
00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:03.750
It's a big stunt, blah, blah. Meanwhile, you're the one. I mean, it costs you,

154
00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:04.740
you don't have to tell me how much,

155
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:09.360
but I assume it costs you quite a penny to convert the operation. Not only that,

156
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:11.460
but what you're then not making in pillows.

157
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:16.070
<v 0>Oh, absolutely. You know, that was God, the guys,</v>

158
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:19.160
we have beak of rewarding me for just speaking out his name,

159
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.600
because now when that happened, everybody, you know, we had,

160
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.600
we had laid off a bunch of people that were on the road doing home shows.

161
00:09:26.601 --> 00:09:30.520
I have 90, some people that do home shows and fairs like I used to do. They,

162
00:09:30.521 --> 00:09:34.460
they had lost their jobs because they were closed and my stores were closed.

163
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.640
Well, now they could all get, they could all get on phones.

164
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:42.560
They're still coming in. You know, they're still coming in. And, uh, and, uh,

165
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:46.640
but they could get on phones now. And with our business went up, like you say,

166
00:09:46.641 --> 00:09:50.450
for every one attack nine people. It's even more than that.

167
00:09:50.451 --> 00:09:54.620
I think for every one attack, 50 people would go after that guy.

168
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.260
What's wrong with you? You know what I mean? They would tell that guy,

169
00:09:57.261 --> 00:10:00.320
what is wrong with you? Do you do a great things? What have you done?

170
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.480
And these hosts on MSN, Jim Acosta was sitting 10 feet from me now.

171
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:10.130
And he bad mouth me saying I was a PR stunt that I did that he

172
00:10:10.131 --> 00:10:14.300
played me directly a PR stunt to get to promote my pillow.

173
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:19.130
Are you kidding? Maybe you didn't listen. Right, Jim? I was promoting Jesus.

174
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.640
