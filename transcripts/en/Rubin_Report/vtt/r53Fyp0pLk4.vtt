00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.140
<v 0>They're all happy and it's, and I know why they're happy and it's it's,</v>

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.980
there are three kinds of things that I think are that, that make them happy.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.780
And I don't really aspire to them, which is weird, but, um, family, community,

4
00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:15.690
religion. And I think that th I think that like, uh,

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.160
people build these inner circles outward. They have themselves,

6
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:21.030
and they have their family.

7
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:22.650
Then they have their community and they have religion,

8
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.810
or it might be religion might be the closest thing,

9
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.460
but those are the things I'm not religious, but I understand why it works.

10
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.260
And religious people tend to be incredibly nice and, and,

11
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.570
and forgiving and will help you. And they're,

12
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.200
and part of being religious is actually helping people being charitable.

13
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.800
That's the same thing. And it also bleeds into their family and their community.

14
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.740
<v 2>So I really liked the title of the book because the,</v>

15
00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:56.270
plus the idea basically that,

16
00:00:56.271 --> 00:00:59.390
that there are positive things out there that you can aspire to,

17
00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:01.820
that you can kind of incorporate in your life and everything else. Um,

18
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.130
we've talked about this a little bit on your show,

19
00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:08.750
but one of the things that I'm kind of amazed by right now is that a certain

20
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.520
set of people. And I would say generally politically they're on the right.

21
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.740
They are actually much happier than the people on the left. Um,

22
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.570
and I don't think that has to do solely with politics or are you with me on

23
00:01:23.571 --> 00:01:26.450
that? Do you see a fundamental reason that even when I just,

24
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.950
just the Fox crew that I've become friendly with, so you and Dana and,

25
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.910
and, uh, Tucker and Hannity, like I, from what I know,

26
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.570
I know you the best happened, but like everyone's happy.

27
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.370
<v 0>They're all happy. And it's, and I know why they're happy and it's it's,</v>

28
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.210
there are three kind of things that I think are that, that make them happy.

29
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.010
And I don't really aspire to them, which is weird, but, um, family, community,

30
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:54.920
religion. And I think that th I think that like, uh,

31
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.390
people build these inner circles outward. They have themselves,

32
00:01:59.391 --> 00:02:00.260
and they have their family.

33
00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:01.910
Then they have their community and they have religion,

34
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.070
or it might be religion might be the closest thing,

35
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.690
but those are the things I'm not religious, but I understand why it works.

36
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.480
And religious people tend to be incredibly nice and, and,

37
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.680
and forgiving and will help you. And,

38
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.430
and part of being religious is actually helping people being charitable.

39
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.090
That's the same thing. And it also bleeds into their family and their community.

40
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.590
There is a certain, you know,

41
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.190
possibility or potential for intolerance intolerance as you know,

42
00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:31.790
among religions. And that's always something to be watched out for,

43
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.270
but it provides a structure for people. So I think, but it's true. It's like,

44
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.550
uh, everybody's very happy. Like I am, uh, I am probably more, uh,

45
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.230
uh, I think I,

46
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.670
I swing between poles in terms of happiness and unhappiness because I'm

47
00:02:46.671 --> 00:02:50.960
neurotic. So I, I would say that I'm at my happiest point in my life,

48
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.880
but that's still not as happy as they are because of my neurosis and anxiety

49
00:02:55.881 --> 00:03:00.730
prevents me from jumping completely into the happiness, you know, but.

50
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.050
<v 2>Greg, as a, as a self-help guru, I can tell you now, uh, that it's,</v>

51
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.310
it's that neurosis, but it's that neurosis that that's sort of creating why,

52
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:13.240
what you do works because whenever I'm on, on the Greg Gutfeld show,

53
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.750
when we text, after you always say the same thing to me, if it's a good show,

54
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:20.830
you go, we got all the serious stuff out at the beginning, and then we add fun.

55
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.760
And I think that that's what people are responding to. So it's like your show,

56
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:26.440
I'm sure, you know, the numbers. I mean,

57
00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:31.120
you are crushing it crushing the late night people right now.

58
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.090
And it's like, they're the ones that have 30 writers.

59
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.040
They've got millions and millions of dollars worth of budgets and all that

60
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:41.390
stuff. And they're miserable and unfunny. How,

61
00:03:41.391 --> 00:03:42.880
how many people work on your show?

62
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.060
<v 0>Eight maybe. And, and in terms of writing that show, uh, eh,</v>

63
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.000
we used to do this every night with red eye with roughly the same crew.

64
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.830
And it it's, uh,

65
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.520
like I ride my monologue and then Tom and Holly and this other kid,

66
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.830
gene we'll we'll work on the segments and the graphics,

67
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.770
I'd better not leave anybody out. And of course, cat does her thing,

68
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.670
which is really good and Tyrus writes his stuff. It's um,

69
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.750
and it's naturally funny and smart. And you aren't having, you,

70
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.040
aren't sitting in a air conditioned room with 13 people who are all making six

71
00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:18.480
figures ordering in let's order in and write 40 more jokes for Kimmel's

72
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.510
monologue. Uh, nobody. Right. I mean,

73
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.200
I I'm opening myself up when I say nobody writes my jokes because that's like,

74
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.810
we can tell Greg, but I like,

75
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.920
but I always start with like, okay, I have a serious point to make.

76
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.160
And then you work your way through that. And then at the end,

77
00:04:35.161 --> 00:04:37.530
there are these jokes that come up absurdities. And I,

78
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.340
instead of just leaving them out, I put them in and it always helps to be,

79
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.360
you know, to have targets that are hilarious. I mean, CNN never gets old,

80
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.850
you know, as long as you have Chris Cuomo and Don lemon,

81
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.230
I'm going to have a monologue. And, uh, it, uh, Brian Stelter, I mean,

82
00:04:52.231 --> 00:04:56.850
these are the gifts that, you know, keep on slobbering. Yeah.

83
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.150
<v 2>Well, that's the thing, because it's like, if you look at the CNN crew now,</v>

84
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.480
not only do they all seem miserable and then we can end the lies and all that

85
00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:07.020
stuff. But like, you guys are having fun. Like there,

86
00:05:07.021 --> 00:05:08.790
there doesn't seem to be any level of fun there.

87
00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:12.330
And I'm not saying the news has to be fun per se, but I think it does.

88
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.110
It does color something else beneath it or something like that.

89
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.660
<v 0>Think about like the daily show with Jon Stewart was having fun during that</v>

90
00:05:21.661 --> 00:05:25.410
period. I don't see that anywhere. Even on comedy central,

91
00:05:25.411 --> 00:05:29.760
you really don't see any fun. I I've said this to you before. I always use it.

92
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.950
I call it the Dean wormer effect that like,

93
00:05:31.951 --> 00:05:33.900
for the longest time in animal house,

94
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.760
the Republicans were always Dean wormer and everybody else Ludo and the Delta

95
00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:43.620
house, we, the whole goal of when Andrew was alive and,

96
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.370
and, uh, I was working at the Huffington post was to flip it. So yeah,

97
00:05:47.371 --> 00:05:49.020
so the Republicans would be,

98
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.380
at some point would become Delta house and deliver,

99
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.370
and the left would become a Dean wormer. And that's, what's happening. You know,

100
00:05:56.371 --> 00:05:58.760
this, you Dean warmer and you're watching this.

101
00:05:58.761 --> 00:06:02.540
I think I'm curious about how you feel about that tie AB because I feel really

102
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:03.380
guilty about the,

103
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.270
all the times that I kind of dismissed him as just the left wing will do the way

104
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:10.940
he dismissed me. I'm sure he didn't even maybe know who I was,

105
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.880
but I see him now. And I go like, he's Dave Rubin,

106
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.000
he's two months away from you becoming right.

107
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.710
<v 2>I feel like it, you know, it's, it's like a little Pat on my back. It's like,</v>

108
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.030
Oh, all of these people now are just saying what I said years ago. So yeah.

109
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.370
You know, it's like, when you're, when you're ahead of the curve,

110
00:06:27.371 --> 00:06:31.570
you somehow feel behind it in a way when it starts getting to the moment of, of,

111
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.410
uh, mainstream. You're like, ah, but it's good. Like, I don't,

112
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.620
I don't know that he, he knows me specifically, but I'm like, yeah,

113
00:06:38.621 --> 00:06:41.910
you're just writing the same exact stuff I said four years ago. And that's,

114
00:06:41.911 --> 00:06:43.360
that's really great, you know?

115
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.300
<v 0>Yeah. You see that though. You see that with Bret Weinstein,</v>

116
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.310
you see that with his wife, when you listen to that, what they're,

117
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.490
what they go through. And by the way, probably the most, I guess,

118
00:06:51.491 --> 00:06:55.930
disturbing thing about this last couple of months is that how right Brett

119
00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.400
was about, um, what's the name of the biz college green, um, evergreen,

120
00:07:00.401 --> 00:07:04.540
evergreen that would happen in every green. Evergreen has gotten out of the zoo.

121
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.650
It's out of the zoo and, and it's all over the place. And it's like he said,

122
00:07:08.651 --> 00:07:13.000
that was going to happen. And I am trying to maintain a positive,

123
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.630
like this is not going to get any worse because there's no slippery slope with

124
00:07:16.631 --> 00:07:19.480
this. You either, either have law and order, or you don't, you got to stop this.

125
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.770
But so far he's he and his brother had been pretty,

126
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.880
uh, uh, dead on, on this stuff. It makes me very nervous.

127
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.640
<v 2>So for a guy like you, that doesn't want,</v>

128
00:07:30.641 --> 00:07:34.810
I know you don't want the whole system to collapse, but I think you also,

129
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.220
I think we're probably similar in this way.

130
00:07:36.221 --> 00:07:39.100
You understand the why it's collapsing.

131
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.970
What do you see is the way that we can kind of get out of this thing?

132
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.220
<v 0>Well, I, I mean, I'm going to sound like a broken record because I am,</v>

133
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.410
I do agree with Donald Trump,

134
00:07:50.411 --> 00:07:53.860
that fake news is the enemy of the people. I mean,

135
00:07:53.861 --> 00:07:57.430
I don't know if you could find a clearer statement than tear down the wall,

136
00:07:57.431 --> 00:07:58.630
maybe, uh,

137
00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:03.610
because almost all of these things that are happening to us right now tend

138
00:08:03.611 --> 00:08:07.210
to be these psychological conflicts that are ginned up.

139
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.630
And I think if you go to any serious issue where there is an issue,

140
00:08:10.631 --> 00:08:13.780
you can talk about police and policing communities, serious issue.

141
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.560
Does the media add or subtract to it? It's a negative, it's a minus.

142
00:08:17.561 --> 00:08:18.430
It's not a plus.

143
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:23.800
The more that the American public understands how to perceive

144
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:27.970
what's going on on television, cable, television, and not to trust it,

145
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:29.590
the better off we're going to be.

146
00:08:29.591 --> 00:08:33.520
I think the first thing we have to do is understand that this is not our friend,

147
00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.330
that this, this is a, this is a machinery of division.

148
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.050
That's trying to get us to eat each other alive and they,

149
00:08:41.051 --> 00:08:44.410
and then they don't see it. Like you see on CNN going, you know, we,

150
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.510
this what's happening. They yesterday, you know,

151
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.450
what's happening in Portland is we don't condone it,

152
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.280
but it's being exaggerated, you know, by that pouncing right-wing media, no,

153
00:08:54.281 --> 00:08:58.380
they found a dead body in, in Minneapolis, in a burned out, you know,

154
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.940
a pawn shop that ain't pouncing. That's a corpse. So I mean,

155
00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:03.774
it is,

156
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:08.490
I think that the first thing is realization that this institution is gone.

157
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.400
It's your enemy. And, and, uh, and I,

158
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.880
and fake news is the enemy of the people sound. So, you know,

159
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:19.590
it sounds so Trumpy in, but it actually, God, we knew this,

160
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.420
right. We always it's like, like, if you, and by the way, you know this,

161
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:28.470
I know this specifically because anytime anybody writes about you,

162
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.520
it's never right. It's never, it's like you, you get a, you know,

163
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:34.710
I've been written about, I don't know, a bunch of times,

164
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.960
and if the person loves your show, it's going to be great.

165
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.950
But if they're coming from a liberal institution in which they have editors,

166
00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.130
they can't compliment you. They can't see your point of view.

167
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.660
They can't even empathize.

168
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.650
So they'll go like Dave Rubin claims to be a traditional liberal who became

169
00:09:49.651 --> 00:09:51.540
disillusioned with the progressive left,

170
00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.410
what he likes to call it a walking man or regressive,

171
00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.930
we met Gabe. And, but, and it's like,

172
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.020
and then there's like six or seven cutting remarks.

173
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:04.440
And then some comment from somebody who doesn't like you, well,

174
00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:07.380
here's the thing about Dave that you probably aren't aware of it.

175
00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:08.790
And so it builds and you go like, wow,

176
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.900
this whole story was just designed to take me down.

177
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:14.010
And it's not true.

178
00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:18.390
I didn't say that I've had instances with reputable journalists where I go,

179
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.900
that didn't happen. That didn't happen. And then if you end up on Twitter,

180
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.690
calling people out, you could be there all day. You know, and I,

181
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:29.550
I I've called out four or five people and they've retracted others don't. But,

182
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:34.920
um, you know, it's, if you, if you are the object of a story, you know,

183
00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:38.340
this, you knew that, you know how this works, they seek a narrative.

184
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:42.900
They need to tell a story. If the beach doesn't have a shark, it's not a story.

185
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.580
So they need to have a shark at that beach.

186
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.170
