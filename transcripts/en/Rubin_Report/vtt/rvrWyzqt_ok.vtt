1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:00.451
<v 0>All right,</v>

2
00:00:00.451 --> 00:00:03.750
we're doing a quick hit today to help highlight someone who's fighting these

3
00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:07.200
insane lockdowns as hopefully you are in your own little way.

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.660
I'll be sitting down with Anton, the owner of Nick,

5
00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:11.880
the Greek restaurant in Ventura County.

6
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.110
And you probably recognize him because he's the guy who stood up to government

7
00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:18.900
regulators trying to shut down his business.

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.410
I'm going to throw to the viral video that has been seen millions of times

9
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:25.830
already. And then we're going to go right into my interview with Anton.

10
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.600
So first take a look at the video.

11
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.443
<v 1>I'm aware of</v>

12
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.670
[inaudible] I'm allowed to do I've put tables outside. I sold all my food to go.

13
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.680
I didn't, I didn't do any

14
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.330
[inaudible] that you guys, when we start the lawsuit

15
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:40.803
against the health department.

16
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.970
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

17
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.000
<v 0>It's all right, Anton, we just showed the viral clip.</v>

18
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.890
It's very obvious to me that not all heroes wear capes. You stood up to the man,

19
00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.470
man. How you feeling?

20
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.650
<v 3>Uh, yeah, it did. Um, uh, I mean that, that, that video was not,</v>

21
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.230
I had no intention of that video going viral is that was,

22
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.160
that was literally just my emotion in the time, um, that that happened.

23
00:03:12.161 --> 00:03:16.060
And it was just, just so happened to be that, that guy, the guy, Jorge Ventura,

24
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.820
I was just coming out of an interview with him. Um,

25
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.460
and those health inspectors were there. So, um,

26
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.270
as my reaction came out with alpha inspectors, he, uh,

27
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.840
he was filming the whole video and that that's how it went viral. Um,

28
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.500
there's two inspectors at that, that were there. There was a lady and a guy, uh,

29
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.590
my strong feeling is if, if it was just the lady there,

30
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.260
it would have gone a completely different way. Um,

31
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.000
and just because she was very calm,

32
00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:42.550
she was really trying to get the facts and figure out everything that was going

33
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:45.880
on. Um, and even in the beginning sounded like she was like, okay, like,

34
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:48.310
let me try to figure this out to like help you out type of thing.

35
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.570
Whereas when that guy opened his mouth, he just like, was this aggressed,

36
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:56.350
like he came across as this like aggressive macho person. Um,

37
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.740
and that really like, kind of set it off for me because I was like, excuse me,

38
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.060
like what, like what this doesn't make any sense. Um, and the main, the main,

39
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.340
the main thing, and the main thing with me is,

40
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:09.250
is I don't like when people don't stick to their word, right? So,

41
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.650
so the story started on last Friday,

42
00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:15.070
I spoke to a supervisor at the health department and I was like, listen,

43
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:17.380
I'm going to put my tables out as a protest.

44
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.330
I'm still going to serve all my food to go.

45
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:22.060
I'm not going to actually serve people outside. I'm going to serve it all to go,

46
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.890
let me protest for whatever four hours that evening. Um, and, and just,

47
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.280
just let me do that. And I'm allowed to do that by law. Uh, uh,

48
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.070
right now you're allowed, you're allowed to protest. Um,

49
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.630
and he was fine with that. He was like, you know what,

50
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:37.120
if you're just going to do it for this evening and that night that's fine.

51
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.660
So I said, all right, great. Um, and this is when he didn't stick to his word,

52
00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:43.090
because that evening around seven 30, uh,

53
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.010
two health inspectors came in and were like, listen,

54
00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:47.860
we're going to have to give you a closure notice. And I'm like, look, look,

55
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:51.490
I understand that I'm not following the rules right now because I put my tables

56
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:54.250
outside, but it was as a protest. So let me take them inside right now.

57
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.510
And let's just bring it about all,

58
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.300
you don't need to give me a closure notice because I'm going to follow your

59
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:02.140
rules now. And they're like, okay, okay, let me talk to her. Let's talk to her.

60
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.900
Let me talk to our supervisors. So they call the supervisor, came back and said,

61
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.760
Nope, we still have to order you a closure notice.

62
00:05:06.761 --> 00:05:09.760
And by this time I had already put all my tables inside and I'm like,

63
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.890
I'm following your rules now. Why are we seeing to go down this route? So, uh,

64
00:05:14.891 --> 00:05:16.750
what ended up happening was you're like, yeah,

65
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.480
you're going to have to contact the health department to be able to reopening

66
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.920
it. And I said, well, today's Friday night.

67
00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:22.690
You guys aren't open on Saturday and Sunday.

68
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.660
I'm not closing my rule for Saturday and Sunday cause I have bills to pay,

69
00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:30.400
you know? Um, so, so I ended up leaving my business open, uh, Saturday,

70
00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:33.580
Sunday, Monday morning, that same supervisor called me and I said, Hey, listen,

71
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:35.770
man, last time we talked, you didn't stick to your words.

72
00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.080
I'm going to record this conversation, which is exactly what I did.

73
00:05:38.081 --> 00:05:41.410
I recorded the conversation. And, um,

74
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.750
basically the conversation went to the fact where he was like, look,

75
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:47.080
if you put to me on an email that you're going to continue complying, uh,

76
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.330
you're going to continue to have your chairs and tables inside and continue to

77
00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:53.490
serve only to go in for delivery is like, you can reel all reinstate you,

78
00:05:53.491 --> 00:05:55.780
you can re reopen back again. I said, all right, well,

79
00:05:55.781 --> 00:05:58.250
this time I'm filming and recording you. So you better keep your word.

80
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.910
He's like, yes I will. So I sent him that email a few minutes after I said,

81
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:04.850
look, I'm going to comply. Fine. Let me go about my business.

82
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:08.360
Let's just drop this whole thing. And two hours later, he, uh,

83
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.400
he comes back and Lemo says, actually, you know what?

84
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:13.190
Because we heard that you were open on Saturday and Sunday. Uh,

85
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:16.280
you're going to have for men closed now, God, I'm like, look.

86
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.950
And when I got that email, that's when I was ready.

87
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:22.250
Like this is the second time this guy is not stuck to his word. And he's again.

88
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.840
So, um, and that's the exact time that Jorge Ventura was interviewing me.

89
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:30.170
And that's the exact time was two health inspectors came in. So my, my,

90
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.410
my emotion was ready at its highest because of that email that came in.

91
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:35.150
So that's, that's how it went.

92
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.850
<v 0>First off, basically,</v>

93
00:06:36.851 --> 00:06:40.390
the guy's lying to you and you have to stay open on the weekends because it's

94
00:06:40.391 --> 00:06:42.910
hard enough to, to make ends meet at this point.

95
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.820
Was anyone even sitting at your tables outside? And again,

96
00:06:45.821 --> 00:06:49.330
you weren't serving them out there. You were saying, okay, you take it to go.

97
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.610
And then there's a seat there. If you happen to sit there,

98
00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:53.380
I think people are still allowed to sit outdoors,

99
00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:55.030
but was anyone even using those seats?

100
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.890
<v 3>Yeah. So on that I said, yeah, some people were sitting out on the,</v>

101
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.780
on the table. Some people were sitting on a curb.

102
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.560
People were kind of sitting wherever they, wherever they could eat their food.

103
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.280
Um, and again, that's not that and the health department's like, well,

104
00:07:09.281 --> 00:07:11.320
you're responsible for that. I don't feel,

105
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.230
and I am not responsible for other human beings.

106
00:07:14.231 --> 00:07:17.380
I also don't have the right to go up to somebody and tell them what to do.

107
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.050
It's not in my, it's not my right at all.

108
00:07:20.051 --> 00:07:22.690
So that's the whole point is like their, their,

109
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.780
their way of thinking is just out of this world. It makes no sense.

110
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.570
It's so I'm going to go around now and start telling people,

111
00:07:28.571 --> 00:07:32.050
you can't do this and you can do that. And that it's not in my right. Yeah.

112
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.810
<v 0>Like a very terrible government regulator. Obviously,</v>

113
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.460
if you don't think that's it in your right.

114
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.590
So can you just talk about just generally,

115
00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:40.590
like you got a smile on your face right now, but you,

116
00:07:40.591 --> 00:07:43.180
you have to be seriously frustrated with what's going on here.

117
00:07:43.181 --> 00:07:46.960
I know you have a couple of locations we ordered in for my whole team, from the,

118
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.500
uh, from the LA location and you guys make great food. Um,

119
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.590
can you just talk about just the, the general frustrations that you,

120
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.290
that all restaurants or all restaurant tours are feeling?

121
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.780
<v 3>Well, I think the biggest frustration right now,</v>

122
00:07:58.781 --> 00:08:02.500
and the reason why people are really lashing out right now is because over the

123
00:08:02.501 --> 00:08:04.930
summer, when they, when they shut everything down,

124
00:08:04.931 --> 00:08:07.570
the government was giving money weekly to people. Well,

125
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.910
they were doing the PVP loans for businesses.

126
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.550
So everybody could continue on paying their bills because the economy is

127
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.960
continuing to move forward. This time around,

128
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:21.130
they're shutting down restaurants and they're not going to give us any PP money.

129
00:08:21.131 --> 00:08:25.150
They're not going to help our employees out by giving them money weekly.

130
00:08:25.151 --> 00:08:28.810
So it's like, well, how do you expect my employees to go pay for their rent?

131
00:08:28.811 --> 00:08:31.090
How do you expect me to pay for my rent? I mean, it's just,

132
00:08:31.091 --> 00:08:34.210
it's a chain reaction and a chain of fact, that's, that makes no sense.

133
00:08:34.211 --> 00:08:37.150
And it's not fair at all, especially with big box stores.

134
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.870
And when you walk into any Costco, Lowe's home Depot, I mean,

135
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:42.040
there's a ton of people in there.

136
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:46.140
It really does not look like they're controlling that whole 20% occupied,

137
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.610
25% occupancy in those stores.

138
00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:52.360
And it just so happens to be because those stores aren't controlled by the

139
00:08:52.361 --> 00:08:53.194
health department,

140
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.330
restaurants are controlled by the health and which I also don't even know if

141
00:08:57.331 --> 00:09:02.070
it's in their right to control the outdoor seating because health department is

142
00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:06.750
supposed to be for the health of a or for the food and safety or the safety of

143
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:10.830
the food in a restaurant to make sure that people are not getting sick. Uh,

144
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.250
that's the job of the health department with a restaurant? Um,

145
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.290
not to go around saying you can't,

146
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.050
you can't have people sitting outside that's that's never been part of it.

147
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:19.790
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

148
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:24.640
Did you happen to see that video of the health inspector guy in,

149
00:09:24.641 --> 00:09:29.090
in LA basically saying that we know that outdoor dining doesn't spread the

150
00:09:29.091 --> 00:09:31.160
disease, but we just want to keep people at home.

151
00:09:31.161 --> 00:09:32.510
Did you happen to catch that video?

152
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.100
<v 3>Oh, no. I didn't say that. That's I didn't see it, but that makes, yeah, that's,</v>

153
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:37.971
that's the whole thing.

154
00:09:37.971 --> 00:09:42.750
It's not scientifically proven that outdoor dining at spreads COVID faster than,

155
00:09:42.751 --> 00:09:44.700
than anything else. So, and that's the whole thing is,

156
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:47.900
is everyone just wants a level playing field, right. So it's like, okay,

157
00:09:47.901 --> 00:09:50.930
if we're going to shut things out, shut everybody down. If you're not,

158
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.710
then don't shut everybody down and let us all continue. I mean, you, you can't,

159
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:55.041
again,

160
00:09:55.041 --> 00:09:58.340
you can't have this unlevel playing field where we're all these other stores are

161
00:09:58.341 --> 00:10:00.500
making a ton of money and we're not.

162
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:05.750
But having said that mom and pop like clothing stores that are on main

163
00:10:05.751 --> 00:10:09.590
street in Ventura, they're feeling the revenue also dipping right now. Why?

164
00:10:09.591 --> 00:10:11.360
Because people aren't coming downtown to eat.

165
00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:14.990
So they're also not coming downtown to shop well, it's not only affecting us.

166
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.150
It's affecting retail, other retailers, you know.

167
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.330
<v 0>Are you going to stay in, uh, in California?</v>

168
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.000
That's the million dollar question that I get asked a hundred times a day.

169
00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:26.510
But like, as a business guy, as someone trying to, you know,

170
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.690
do something good and put out a good product,

171
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.550
but having to deal with these guys, like,

172
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.110
do you think about getting out of here?

173
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:38.000
<v 3>Yeah, I do. Um, I just have a growth plan for the restaurants right now within,</v>

174
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.630
uh, within California. Um, and, and with everything going on,

175
00:10:41.631 --> 00:10:44.360
I still hope that I can continue to, to hit it. Uh,

176
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.150
this is most likely going to hinder that, but, um,

177
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.140
if I am able to hit it most likely once I'm, once, once I've gotten,

178
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.170
once I've reached my goal, then I probably will be moving to a,

179
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.140
to a different state. Not unless California starts changing, but I mean,

180
00:10:57.141 --> 00:11:00.650
you look at Elon Musk is, has moved. Tesla's moved, uh,

181
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.490
Oracle's moved all these. And, and the crazy thing to me is, is,

182
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.280
is I don't understand to see how, um, how,

183
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:11.780
how there all the money that's coming in to California because of these

184
00:11:11.781 --> 00:11:14.600
companies. That's now not going to be because it's going somewhere.

185
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.730
As on all these people that were, they were employing. I mean,

186
00:11:16.731 --> 00:11:20.840
how do they see the future going along? You know, it's really tough.

187
00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:25.640
<v 0>Well, listen, man, I know you didn't ask for this fight, but you're in it now.</v>

188
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.380
And anything I can do to help just let me know.

189
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:31.310
<v 3>One more thing I want to say is, um, the,</v>

190
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.870
the officials that are controlling things right now are the same type of people,

191
00:11:35.871 --> 00:11:38.540
which I find completely ridiculous as when,

192
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.400
back when they tried to shut Tesla down.

193
00:11:40.401 --> 00:11:43.670
And there was that government official leader and said, Elon Musk, or you,

194
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:45.590
Ron Mars, like who does that?

195
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.130
Especially if you're trying to portray yourself in a leadership position,

196
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.800
you don't do that. I mean, and that's basically,

197
00:11:51.801 --> 00:11:54.640
those are the type of people that are trying to us, like that's, it's,

198
00:11:54.641 --> 00:11:56.800
it's completely out of this world and ridiculous, in my opinion.

199
00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.750
<v 0>Anton, you want to run for governor. People want me to run for governor?</v>

200
00:12:00.751 --> 00:12:02.460
I feel like, I feel like you're better suited.

201
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.433
<v 3>I don't think I don't.</v>

202
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.190
I don't think I can take that on man politics as a whole different,

203
00:12:08.191 --> 00:12:09.690
a different ball game.

204
00:12:09.691 --> 00:12:11.850
I'll I'll stick to be a business of being an entrepreneur.

205
00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:15.710
<v 0>All right. Stick to the falafel in the meantime. All right. Well listen.</v>

206
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.380
Anything, anything I can do to help? I'm not just saying it. You got my number.

207
00:12:19.381 --> 00:12:23.130
So just let me know and we'll just keep the spotlight on you guys.

208
00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:24.443
And I wish you luck.

209
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.100
<v 3>Dave one, sorry.</v>

210
00:12:26.101 --> 00:12:30.450
This is really the last thing I want to say is saying anything that you can do

211
00:12:30.451 --> 00:12:34.260
to help. What I'd love for you to do is, uh, because we've gone viral,

212
00:12:34.261 --> 00:12:37.350
we've got so much support from literally people in different States,

213
00:12:37.351 --> 00:12:41.160
calling in and ordering food to support us, and also trying to donate.

214
00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:46.380
If you could go out and tell all of the us and these same people,

215
00:12:46.381 --> 00:12:47.130
Hey, listen,

216
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.610
don't only do that to Nick the Greek start calling up random restaurants in

217
00:12:50.611 --> 00:12:53.700
California and do those good deeds to all the restaurants. Cause again,

218
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:57.360
my whole point from the get-go was to help restaurants as a whole.

219
00:12:57.361 --> 00:12:59.130
This wasn't for me and this wasn't for Nick, the Greek.

220
00:12:59.131 --> 00:12:59.970
This is for the whole thing.

221
00:12:59.971 --> 00:13:03.030
So if all these people can call a random restaurants in California and just

222
00:13:03.031 --> 00:13:05.520
start ordering food, I mean, that'd be, that'd be amazing.

223
00:13:05.521 --> 00:13:08.640
And that's how you can help spread that because you have the audience. So.

224
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:12.330
<v 0>I'm on it, man. You're a true American. Thanks for taking the time. Now,</v>

225
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.620
get back to work for God's sakes.

226
00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.673
<v 3>All right. See ya.</v>

227
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.220
<v 0>If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics,</v>
