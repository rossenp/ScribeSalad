1
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.070
<v 1>All right. People. This is the Rubin report. Direct message.</v>

2
00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:17.210
I'm still Dave Rubin and we are just days out from the big election.

3
00:00:17.211 --> 00:00:21.830
Can you believe it just days out from the very day that will decide the

4
00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:26.720
future of humanity? We're almost there guys. I voted yesterday.

5
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.250
That's going to be one of our stories.

6
00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:30.830
I didn't even have to show my ID was really wonderful.

7
00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:35.480
I would have to show my ID to buy a beer. Uh, even though I'm 44 years old,

8
00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:37.820
I still get Aidid, but you don't have to show your ID to vote.

9
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.480
So we're going to talk about that. We are going to talk about, uh,

10
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.620
measure 16 here in California, where, uh,

11
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.760
the progressives,

12
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.530
the wonderful lefties are putting racism back into the system and we got to

13
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:55.430
vote on it. So I voted on it. I'll show you what I decided on,

14
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:58.340
whether I wanted the country to be more racist or less racist,

15
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.340
and we'll read the exact text. And, uh, you know,

16
00:01:01.341 --> 00:01:04.190
if you don't have systemic racism in the system,

17
00:01:04.191 --> 00:01:08.000
which we don't here in the United States, there are no racist laws, uh,

18
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.130
the best way to get systemic racism.

19
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:12.530
So you can use it to fuel the fire of burning.

20
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:14.840
Everything down that you're trying to do is to put it on the ballot,

21
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.480
especially here in California. Cause these people are idiots. Uh,

22
00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:20.300
so we're going to cover that. Uh, then we're going to talk about, uh,

23
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.810
coronavirus deaths because they are dropping. Believe it or not,

24
00:01:23.811 --> 00:01:28.400
the media seems to be pushing this notion that they're, they're growing again,

25
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.140
everything's going up and up and up.

26
00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:33.950
It's a little hard to decipher some of the information because obviously as we

27
00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:36.890
test more, we see more rising cases.

28
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.010
This is where Trump always gets lost in language because people say, well,

29
00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:41.660
if we, he always says, well, if we weren't testing,

30
00:01:41.661 --> 00:01:43.910
we wouldn't see the numbers going up. And people are like, no,

31
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:46.880
the numbers would still go up. You're both kind of correct. Uh,

32
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.570
if we weren't testing, that means, uh, numbers could be going up or down.

33
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:52.130
We wouldn't know. So the more you test,

34
00:01:52.131 --> 00:01:55.760
the more you're going to see that the numbers are going up in case if in fact

35
00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:58.370
they are going up. Uh, but in essence,

36
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.690
there is a new study that is confirming the fact that

37
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.470
deaths are dropping despite cases rising.

38
00:02:06.471 --> 00:02:09.530
So we'll get into some of the numbers. I hope you brought your calculator.

39
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.510
And then the third story for today is that big tech hearing yesterday. Uh,

40
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.280
I focus mostly on Jack Dorsey yesterday and the fact that he basically

41
00:02:19.281 --> 00:02:22.670
lied under oath, Ted Cruz, and could be in a lot of trouble for doing that.

42
00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:23.900
And you guys know all the,

43
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.600
all the stuff about big tech censorship and the rest of it,

44
00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:30.590
but then something really interesting happened where Mark Zuckerberg,

45
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.570
who of course is the synthetic humanoid that's in charge of, uh, Facebook. Uh,

46
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.860
he did not know apparently that the head of election integrity

47
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.510
at, uh, Facebook, you still work for, you're not going to believe it guys,

48
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.640
Joe, by can. I know it's so weird. It's just, it's just so weird.

49
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.980
So we're going to get into all that I'm feeling good today.

50
00:02:51.981 --> 00:02:54.590
I'm highly caffeinated. I put on a jacket for you.

51
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.030
And before we do anything else, guys, I want to talk to you about built bar.

52
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.800
Are you guys looking for a new protein bar that tastes like a candy bar?

53
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.840
I've got just the brand for you.

54
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.790
Built bars are super tasty and come in 18 amazing flavors. My personal favorite,

55
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:12.430
as you know already is the cookies and cream that I've got right here,

56
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:15.400
but we've got a box filled with all kinds and I've been trying them.

57
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:18.280
And they're good people. Bill bars are covered in a hundred percent.

58
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.720
Chocolate include both nut and nut free flavors and are soft and easy to chew

59
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.810
with Halloween just days away. It's easy to slip up,

60
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:29.410
which is why bill bars are the perfect alternative to candy for the health

61
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:30.640
conscious guy.

62
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.390
I can actually lose or maintain weight while indulging in a delicious treat,

63
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.780
built bars or low calorie, low sugar, high protein, and high fiber.

64
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:41.420
I'm not making it up guys. Then the six pack quite there yet, but we're,

65
00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:42.254
we're getting close.

66
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.800

69
00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:56.640
Good for bill BARR is built, go or bill boost. And now back to me,

70
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.500
hello. All right. So I voted yesterday, guys. I early voted,

71
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.280
uh, David and I went to our local polling station.

72
00:04:05.281 --> 00:04:09.780
We brought our IDs. We brought some documentation showing where we live,

73
00:04:09.781 --> 00:04:14.610
the whole thing we got in the car. Our, we went in and we voted,

74
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.360
we did not have to show IDs. We did not have to show any identification.

75
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.730
I did not realize that. I actually didn't realize that.

76
00:04:20.731 --> 00:04:23.670
I remember that during the primaries where I did vote,

77
00:04:23.671 --> 00:04:26.430
that I didn't need anything. And I thought that was a little bizarre.

78
00:04:26.431 --> 00:04:29.310
And I know there's always this ongoing thing about voter ID,

79
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.310
but I thought surely at the national election,

80
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.390
someone's going to check something right? Like that. You can't just walk in.

81
00:04:36.391 --> 00:04:40.830
Just say you are whoever you are and know someone's address and vote as them.

82
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.150
But that is literally what you can do here in the banana Republic of California.

83
00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:47.760
So I said my name and I said, my address,

84
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.170
I did not show any evidence that I am me or that I live in that place.

85
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.740
And then I went up to the machine and it was electronic and touch pad and the

86
00:04:55.741 --> 00:04:59.060
whole thing. And I, and I did my thing, but quite literally, and,

87
00:04:59.061 --> 00:05:03.600
and I don't want people to feel that the election is illegitimate.

88
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.950
Obviously you don't want to,

89
00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:06.960
but we do have to secure our elections at some level,

90
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.220
the idea that you don't have to show an ID. So I could actually go back.

91
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.260
I could get in my car right now. And in eight minutes,

92
00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:17.100
be at my polling station again. And assuming that they didn't know who I was,

93
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.760
I could say, yeah, I'm Bob, blah, blah, blah. And I live at do-do to do,

94
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.300
and then I could vote as Bob and then Bob could show up and I guess Bob would be

95
00:05:24.301 --> 00:05:26.970
screwed. I mean, the idea, let's just be very, very clear on this.

96
00:05:26.971 --> 00:05:31.380
The only people who don't want voter ideal ID laws are the people who are for

97
00:05:31.381 --> 00:05:35.670
voter fraud. Okay? Everyone can get an ID. You need an ID to buy a beer.

98
00:05:35.671 --> 00:05:39.630
You need an ID to drive a car. You need an ID to get on a plane.

99
00:05:39.631 --> 00:05:42.480
But for some reason, if we say to people, you need an ID to vote,

100
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.990
which is your most important civic duty. Somehow that's construed as racist,

101
00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:47.100
right? It's racist,

102
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.680
or you don't want poor people to vote or something like that.

103
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.630
Everyone can get an ID. Virtually everyone has an ID. It's offensive.

104
00:05:54.631 --> 00:05:57.890
If you were to say, well, black people don't have IDs. What you talking about?

105
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.420
Your racists, you guys realize that you guys are the racist.

106
00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.360
You call everybody racist, but you're the actual racist.

107
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.640
I have plenty of black friends. They all have IDs.

108
00:06:06.641 --> 00:06:11.620
I fairly certain I know who they all are. Uh, the whole thing is so stupid. Um,

109
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.620
but so the idea that you can do, this is kind cool, crazy. Uh,

110
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.780
but let's talk about who I voted for. And,

111
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:20.800
and one of the measures that I voted, yes, we,

112
00:06:20.801 --> 00:06:25.690
we can throw up the image because it's out there already. I did vote for

113
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.680
Donald J. Trump and Michael R Pence. Those are the people that I voted for.

114
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.720
Uh, I've been telling you guys for probably about four months,

115
00:06:37.721 --> 00:06:39.910
that was the direction I was headed in. Uh,

116
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.470
right before I went off the grid for August. I did Kyle coz shoots podcast.

117
00:06:44.471 --> 00:06:46.750
And he flat out asked me who I was going to vote for.

118
00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.380
And I hadn't said it publicly yet, but obviously I've been thinking this for,

119
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.760
for many, many months at this point, uh, that, that Trump was the right choice.

120
00:06:54.761 --> 00:06:58.630
Do I think Trump is perfect. Let's do all the asks stuff first.

121
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.140
Do I think Trump is perfect? I don't do.

122
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.990
Sometimes he tweeted less. I do.

123
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:10.240
Is there something kind of funny about his hair? Yes. It's cetera, et cetera.

124
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.740
But has he basically done a good job as president?

125
00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.340
Let let's put Corona virus aside for one second, I will address it, uh,

126
00:07:18.341 --> 00:07:21.610
in just a moment in our whole second story is about Corona before Corona,

127
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.310
did we have an absolutely thriving economy, which by the way, today,

128
00:07:24.311 --> 00:07:26.290
we're getting some numbers that are really, really good on the,

129
00:07:26.291 --> 00:07:29.380
on the rebound we did. And we had all time, low black unemployment, right?

130
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.850
An all time low, uh, Latino unemployment. Absolutely. Uh, yeah.

131
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.021
Peace in the middle East thing.

132
00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:38.530
Israel signing all of these deals with middle East countries. That's good.

133
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.710
That's good. We all used to want middle East peace now, orange man,

134
00:07:41.711 --> 00:07:43.510
we don't want it so much anymore. Uh,

135
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.380
the changing of some of these crazy international deals that we had,

136
00:07:47.381 --> 00:07:48.640
like the Paris climate Accords,

137
00:07:48.641 --> 00:07:52.450
that was a non-binding deal that in effect we were paying for,

138
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.880
and now we're out of, and by the way, uh,

139
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.000
I've read and you guys can find the articles yourself. In many cases were,

140
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.720
we're actually exceeding some of the numbers that were dictated to us by the

141
00:08:01.721 --> 00:08:05.920
power of climates, but by the Paris climate Accords, this is a good thing.

142
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.870
Getting rid of regulation, lowering taxes, all of these things are good.

143
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.790
Oh, and I forgot the big two taking critical race theory out of the

144
00:08:15.791 --> 00:08:19.420
universities and out of our federal institutions.

145
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:23.440
This is beyond massive. If you hate identity, did he politics?

146
00:08:23.441 --> 00:08:26.320
If you love America, if you believe people should be treated as individuals,

147
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.340
Trump,

148
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:31.780
Trump had the most intense death blow to the,

149
00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:33.040
those bads set of ideas.

150
00:08:33.041 --> 00:08:37.600
When he said the government will not Institute these ideas, um,

151
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:42.220
this is huge. So he got critical race theory out. He also reversed title IX.

152
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:47.080
Title IX was the Obama executive action that in essence took away due

153
00:08:47.081 --> 00:08:49.600
process. So if a male student, it did a few things,

154
00:08:49.601 --> 00:08:53.470
but one of them that was used quite frequently was that if a male student was

155
00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:55.920
accused of sexual harassment, basically you didn't,

156
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:58.080
you could be kicked out of college just by the accusation.

157
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.160
And we removed due process. Well, Trump got rid of that.

158
00:09:01.161 --> 00:09:04.100
When he brought in Betsy Devoss as education secretary, there,

159
00:09:04.101 --> 00:09:06.980
there is a series of good things he's done. Um,

160
00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.200
but all of those things combined,

161
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:13.610
I would still say even maybe the bigger thing is that he has fought the media.

162
00:09:13.611 --> 00:09:16.400
He has fought the establishment and,

163
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:20.300
and no other Republican was going to do it. And, and, you know, yeah,

164
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.960
you might go that McCain guy was nicer and that Romney guy was nicer and

165
00:09:23.961 --> 00:09:25.730
whatever it is, those guys,

166
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:29.900
the lost Trump has mapped out a way for right-leaning people, conservatives,

167
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:34.340
disaffected liberals, libertarians to fight the machine.

168
00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:38.960
And that was, that was worthy of my vote. It doesn't mean he's perfect.

169
00:09:38.961 --> 00:09:42.920
And I have no doubt that I'm going to have more hit pieces written about me and

170
00:09:42.921 --> 00:09:46.730
that the rest of the, the anger and the hate will come. But as I often say,

171
00:09:46.731 --> 00:09:49.640
I am my own boss. And the chances that I fire myself are pretty slim,

172
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:54.050
I suppose it could happen one day. Um, so that, that is who I voted for.

173
00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:56.420
I voted for Trump. I was actually very happy to vote for Trump.

174
00:09:56.421 --> 00:09:59.200
And I know again, I'm going to have, I'm going to have not only hippies,

175
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.170
but I know people in my life are not going to be happy with me. But, um,

176
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.150
you know, when I was off the grid, I watched this, uh,

177
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.960
Frank Sinatra documentary on Netflix. It's a,

178
00:10:08.961 --> 00:10:11.750
two-part about two hours each documentary on Frank Sinatra.

179
00:10:11.751 --> 00:10:14.660
And I love Frank Sinatra and the old crooners and the rat pack and all that.

180
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:18.710
But there's a moment where he's talking about elections and voting and things

181
00:10:18.711 --> 00:10:21.230
like that. And he was very politically active as a Democrat at first.

182
00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.320
And then eventually he became friends with Ronald Reagan who became the

183
00:10:24.321 --> 00:10:27.170
Republican governor of California and obviously ultimately president.

184
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.110
And he started the media, started turning on him.

185
00:10:30.111 --> 00:10:33.050
Frank Sinatra was like a darling of the media when he was a Democrat.

186
00:10:33.051 --> 00:10:34.130
And then you're not going to believe it.

187
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.460
This stuff has obviously gone on for decades when he started becoming a little

188
00:10:37.461 --> 00:10:41.420
more conservative or at least supporting a California conservative Ronald

189
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.250
Reagan, the media started going after him and he gave this,

190
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.810
you should watch it in the documentary.

191
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.580
There's just this couple of lines on just how it's your duty as a man to,

192
00:10:48.581 --> 00:10:51.500
to do what you think is right and vote for the people you think is right.

193
00:10:51.501 --> 00:10:56.030
And you have to do that and don't let people cower you and scare you into doing

194
00:10:56.031 --> 00:10:59.210
what they want. So I hope I hope if you're on the fence right now,

195
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.590
whichever way you're going to go,

196
00:11:00.591 --> 00:11:02.750
that you do what your conscience tells you to do.

197
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.940
And now with the mob tells you to do, I think that's,

198
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.820
that's the most important thing that you can do. So anyway,

199
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.610
so I voted for Trump and I didn't have to show my ID.

200
00:11:10.611 --> 00:11:13.970
So tomorrow I'll vote for Trump. Again, it's very, very exciting. And, uh,

201
00:11:13.971 --> 00:11:18.350
and now I want to shift a little bit to, to measure 16 because you know,

202
00:11:18.351 --> 00:11:21.680
when you vote, uh, there's all sorts of people you can vote for. I also,

203
00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:25.580
by the way, I voted for Eric early, who is running against Adam shift, that,

204
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:29.330
that Russia collusion maniac. Uh, so I voted for Eric early.

205
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.860
Who's a Republican running against him.

206
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:35.480
I also voted basically no on all of the measures because everything increases

207
00:11:35.481 --> 00:11:38.840
taxes, sorry, state, you can't have any more money from the people.

208
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:42.320
You don't deserve any of it. There might've been one or two exceptions to that.

209
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:47.150
Um, but basically I voted no on all of those things. And I voted, you know,

210
00:11:47.151 --> 00:11:51.140
I tried to figure out who were the least lefty people though in this state,

211
00:11:51.141 --> 00:11:54.340
it's pretty bananas. Um, but do vote on several measures.

212
00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:57.700
And I want to talk about measure 16 specifically. So let's,

213
00:11:57.701 --> 00:11:58.870
let's throw the image up there.

214
00:11:58.871 --> 00:12:02.710
And I'm going to read to you a little bit about what measures 16 is.

215
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.430
It will allow diversity as a factor in public employment,

216
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.190
education and contracting decisions,

217
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.880
legislative constitutional amendment, just to be very clear.

218
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:16.600
It will allow diversity as a factor in public employment,

219
00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:18.850
education and contracting decisions,

220
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:23.290
meaning they will care about your skin color, your gender and your sexuality.

221
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.400
The stuff that we did, the 64 civil rights act to get rid of.

222
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.520
We shouldn't care about those things. Martin Luther King,

223
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.620
we're not going to care about the color of your skin.

224
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:33.880
That's what he didn't want for his kids.

225
00:12:33.881 --> 00:12:36.820
He wanted them to care about the content of their character, uh,

226
00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:38.680
but not here in California, apparently.

227
00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.110
And I'll just read two parts of this thing. Uh,

228
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:46.090
this proposition would permit the government permits government decision-making

229
00:12:46.091 --> 00:12:49.990
policies to consider race, sex, color, ethnicity,

230
00:12:49.991 --> 00:12:54.880
or national origin to address diversity by repealing article one,

231
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.030
section 30, one of the California constitution.

232
00:12:58.031 --> 00:13:02.050
So we are amending the constitution to put systemic racism into it,

233
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:07.090
which was added by proposition two Oh nine in 1996.

234
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.910
Okay. You got that people. So 24 years ago, we said,

235
00:13:09.911 --> 00:13:14.350
let's get discrimination out. Now we're going to vote it back in apparently, uh,

236
00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:15.550
proposition two Oh nine,

237
00:13:15.551 --> 00:13:20.200
generally prohibit state and local governments from discriminating against or

238
00:13:20.201 --> 00:13:24.400
granting preferential treatment to individuals or groups on the basis of race,

239
00:13:24.401 --> 00:13:25.660
sex, color, ethnicity,

240
00:13:25.661 --> 00:13:29.110
or national origin in the operation of public employment education.

241
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:35.040
That's the good one. You morons. That's the one, two Oh nine.

242
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.130
We wrap this thing up in 96. Okay.

243
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:42.780
That's the good one prohibits state and local governments from discriminating

244
00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:47.040
against or granting preferential treatment to individuals on the basis of race

245
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.590
sex. I read it already. I circled it here.

246
00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:55.440
I put a box over the circle. What is wrong with you people?

247
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:59.640
So we are literally right now in California voting to put racism,

248
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.640
voting, to put discrimination, voting,

249
00:14:02.641 --> 00:14:07.380
to put bigotry back into the system. And let me just try this this way.

250
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:12.060
If you are one of the people who thinks, Oh, but we do want more diversity.

251
00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.050
Well, I understand that. That's a nice thought to have, uh,

252
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:17.340
now think about it this way.

253
00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:21.930
Would you be for discriminating against someone based on their

254
00:14:21.931 --> 00:14:26.880
skin, color, sexuality, gender, or anything else? Ah,

255
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:31.290
gotcha. Denied. Because if you elevate somebody because of those things,

256
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:35.310
you have to D boost to use their language, somebody because of those things.

257
00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.730
So this is nonsensical. It is psychotic. I'm barely,

258
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.010
certainly it's against the constitution of the United States.

259
00:14:41.011 --> 00:14:44.670
And this is the type of thing that could end up as a Supreme court decision. Um,

260
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:49.350
so good luck with that, Amy Coney Barrett. Um, but it's, it's just,

261
00:14:49.351 --> 00:14:53.000
it's just ridiculousness. I wonder if this is happening in any other States,

262
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:54.050
can you guys let me know,

263
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:57.560
throw some comments in there if you see this happening anywhere besides

264
00:14:57.561 --> 00:15:00.050
California, this Looney Looney place. Oh,

265
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.070
and before we move on to the next story, I should mention that, uh,

266
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:07.730
the president, you know, this guy, Trump, um,

267
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.080
I was on Fox and friends this morning. I was up at 4:00 AM for like a five 15,

268
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:15.740
uh, Fox and friends appearance. And then I went to sleep.

269
00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:18.620
I basically was on at five 15 till about five 20.

270
00:15:18.621 --> 00:15:22.220
Then I tried to go to sleep for about two hours. I woke up, my phone was hot,

271
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:25.340
you know, when you know, it'd be like, your phone's going crazy. And it's like,

272
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:28.430
you got like a nuclear device in your hand and you just throw this thing and

273
00:15:28.431 --> 00:15:32.480
it's going to explode. Um, well, Trump tweeted this about me.

274
00:15:32.481 --> 00:15:36.080
We'll throw it up there. Uh, thank you to Dave Rubin author of don't burn.

275
00:15:36.081 --> 00:15:39.980
This book just announced on Fox and friends that he is voting for your favorite

276
00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:43.700
president. Me, I think Donald Trump has done a lot of good.

277
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:48.320
What I see in American flag. I see Trump's support. Well,

278
00:15:48.321 --> 00:15:52.400
I just laid out there. Why I think that our vote, excuse me, why?

279
00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:56.180
I think a vote for Trump is, is sensible and is good and is fair.

280
00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.950
And it doesn't make you a racist or a bigot or anything else. Um, but you got,

281
00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:02.690
this is like one of those things where it's like the way he writes these things,

282
00:16:02.691 --> 00:16:05.690
it's like voting for your favorite president. Me,

283
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:10.880
there's no business like show business like that.

284
00:16:10.881 --> 00:16:14.120
That's kind of where we're at at this point. Um, in any event, it was,

285
00:16:14.121 --> 00:16:17.240
it was nice to see that I already got some people texting me that are,

286
00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.510
that are angry at me because the president tweeted at me. I, you know,

287
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:23.180
in the old days, if the president said something nice about you,

288
00:16:23.181 --> 00:16:26.030
people would support you. So it's a little bit of a strange thing these days.

289
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:30.320
Um, okay. Let's, let's talk about coronavirus because obviously there are,

290
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.590
there are critics of Trump and people who won't vote for Trump because of

291
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:36.560
coronavirus. Um, so I wanted to hold this to the,

292
00:16:36.561 --> 00:16:38.390
to the second story that we're doing right now. Let's,

293
00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:40.280
let's throw the graph up there. Uh,

294
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.980
so NPR and there, you know,

295
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:55.330
these are not people that like Trump studies point to big drop in COVID-19 death

296
00:16:55.331 --> 00:16:57.400
rates. Uh, this is updated as a few days ago.

297
00:16:57.401 --> 00:16:59.380
I'm just going to read a little bit too.

298
00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:03.760
New peer reviewed studies are showing a sharp drop in mortality,

299
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:07.270
amongst hop hospitalized. COVID-19 patients.

300
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:11.560
The drop is seen in all groups, including older patients,

301
00:17:11.561 --> 00:17:15.610
and those with underlying conditions suggesting that physicians are getting

302
00:17:15.611 --> 00:17:18.280
better at helping patients survive their illness.

303
00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:23.230
Mortality has dropped amongst hospitalized patients by 18

304
00:17:23.231 --> 00:17:26.410
percentage points. Since the pandemic began,

305
00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.830
the people who are getting hospitalized now tend to be much younger,

306
00:17:29.831 --> 00:17:33.850
tend to have fewer other diseases and tend to be less frail than people who were

307
00:17:33.851 --> 00:17:37.450
hospitalized in the early days of the epidemic. Okay.

308
00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.890
I wanted to do this story because this is showing you that we're rounding the

309
00:17:41.891 --> 00:17:45.070
corner. We flatten the curve where we're rounding the corner.

310
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:49.030
Other assorted statement that doesn't really explain what's going on.

311
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.690
These are good things, right?

312
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:56.400
These are good things you would report on spiraling death tolls.

313
00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.020
If you want it to show the truth,

314
00:17:58.021 --> 00:18:00.390
but if you really want to do it just to get Trump,

315
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:01.620
then you're not going to show this.

316
00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:05.490
So my guess is CNN is not going to be doing much on this today, right?

317
00:18:05.491 --> 00:18:09.000
The New York times, ain't going to be doing much on this today. Um,

318
00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.970
but the simple truth is the doctors are dealing with it better.

319
00:18:11.971 --> 00:18:13.890
We're seeing less older people die.

320
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:17.580
We also know that younger people that get the disease, they survive.

321
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.690
As I said a few weeks ago, I know a few people that have gotten coronavirus.

322
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:25.080
They were sick for a few days. One of my friends was sick for about 10 days,

323
00:18:25.081 --> 00:18:26.550
but most were sick for two or three days.

324
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.960
I have a friend that got it that had no symptoms whatsoever, um,

325
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:36.240
that you will get past it and you will survive the idea that we have decided

326
00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:39.840
to shut down the entire country destroy people's livelihoods.

327
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:44.730
As I said yesterday, now we know that alcoholism is rising. Suicide is rising.

328
00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.160
People are not getting out. They're not exercising.

329
00:18:47.161 --> 00:18:48.660
They're not seeing other human beings.

330
00:18:48.661 --> 00:18:53.430
We're spending all our days like automated, robotic human autonomy.

331
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:58.230
Um, I mean, it's, it's just we've we made a mistake along the way.

332
00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.760
And where are all of the people?

333
00:18:59.761 --> 00:19:03.240
Where are the freedom loving people saying it's time to move forward. And,

334
00:19:03.241 --> 00:19:04.290
and just imagine,

335
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:09.090
just imagine if Biden gets in charge and the Democrats are in

336
00:19:09.091 --> 00:19:11.490
charge, Biden wants a federal lockdown.

337
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.760
You want to just keep giving these people more power over you.

338
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.580
Gavin Newsome cannot tell me what I can do for Thanksgiving.

339
00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.410
I'm going to do whatever the hell I want to do. You can.

340
00:19:19.411 --> 00:19:21.540
I'm telling you directly right now, Gavin Newsome.

341
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.250
I'm gonna have as many people as I want,

342
00:19:23.251 --> 00:19:25.710
and we're gonna do whatever the hell we want. And that might include singing,

343
00:19:25.711 --> 00:19:29.610
which I know you don't want people to sing your freak. Um, so anyway,

344
00:19:29.611 --> 00:19:33.210
it's important to know that the numbers are going down in terms of mortality.

345
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.840
People are not dying. As much people are getting better and,

346
00:19:36.841 --> 00:19:39.030
and just know that and, and take,

347
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.860
and of course take whatever precautions you see as necessary

348
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.980
to take care of yourself and take care of your family.

349
00:19:46.981 --> 00:19:48.960
But the point is it should be on you.

350
00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:51.900
It should be on you not only as an individual citizen,

351
00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:56.460
but it should be on you as a business owner or as a coach of a

352
00:19:56.461 --> 00:20:00.960
baseball team or whatever it is you do. Let the people,

353
00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.270
the people should make the decisions,

354
00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.660
not these edicts from people that would love to keep us locked down forever.

355
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:11.370
All right, story, number three, I'm feeling very focused today. People,

356
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:15.990
can you feel it very focused? Uh, Mark Zuckerberg was at the big, uh,

357
00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.920
the big, big tech hearing yesterday and, uh, you know,

358
00:20:19.921 --> 00:20:22.920
to do a big tech hearing about big tech, uh,

359
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:26.430
for the Senate right before the election is, is kind of late. So yes,

360
00:20:26.431 --> 00:20:29.670
it's a lot of theater, right? It's a lot of theater because nothing,

361
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:34.800
even if they talked to everybody yesterday and they, even if they own the earth,

362
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:35.581
Oh my God.

363
00:20:35.581 --> 00:20:38.370
We found out the code that they wrote in the algorithm that is suppressing

364
00:20:38.371 --> 00:20:41.070
things. And that is amplifying things and everything else it's like, well,

365
00:20:41.071 --> 00:20:43.950
the damage has been done as far as this election, right? Like there's,

366
00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:46.350
there's nothing that can be done in,

367
00:20:46.351 --> 00:20:50.080
in these now four or five remaining days to fix the misinformation,

368
00:20:50.081 --> 00:20:52.000
the suppression of use and all of those things.

369
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:55.570
This is all about maybe that something can be done in the future.

370
00:20:55.930 --> 00:21:00.520
But I would say the idea of the hearing is good because getting Jack

371
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:03.520
and, and Zuckerberg and the Google guy,

372
00:21:03.521 --> 00:21:08.290
getting these guys out there to talk does bring it forward in the

373
00:21:08.291 --> 00:21:09.041
national conscious,

374
00:21:09.041 --> 00:21:11.980
gets us hopefully to think about some of the issues and that kind of thing. But,

375
00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:16.690
but don't be confused. It's not as if they're going to do something tomorrow,

376
00:21:16.691 --> 00:21:19.360
that's going to save us from big tech. It ain't, it ain't happening.

377
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:23.140
And as I always say, big tech is not purely evil, right?

378
00:21:23.141 --> 00:21:25.960
It's like a fire fire can do good stuff, warm up the house.

379
00:21:25.961 --> 00:21:28.060
Fire can also burn down the house. And,

380
00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:32.800
and I I'm here because of the pipes of YouTube. So, so I get it. I get it right.

381
00:21:32.801 --> 00:21:36.310
Although you should join us@rubinreport.com because I do fully own that and can

382
00:21:36.311 --> 00:21:39.460
communicate directly with you and we can build great communities for you.

383
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.030
Check out locals.com. Um, anyway, there's a,

384
00:21:43.031 --> 00:21:45.610
there's an incredible exchange between John Thune,

385
00:21:45.611 --> 00:21:47.680
Senator John Thune and Mark Zuckerberg.

386
00:21:47.681 --> 00:21:50.920
So I'm going to read a little bit of the exchange because this just sort of sums

387
00:21:50.921 --> 00:21:54.100
up the negligence of our media, the,

388
00:21:54.101 --> 00:21:59.020
the way big tech treats us like children and sort of just the general state

389
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:02.640
of everything. So John Boone said to Zuckerberg,

390
00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:04.890
the person that is in charge of election,

391
00:22:04.891 --> 00:22:09.150
integrity and security at Facebook is a former Joe Biden staffer.

392
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:13.770
Is there someone closely associated with president Trump in the same role at

393
00:22:13.771 --> 00:22:16.170
Facebook? He went on to say,

394
00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.670
how do you all respond to the argument that there isn't sufficient balance in

395
00:22:20.671 --> 00:22:24.540
terms of the political ideology or diversity in your companies?

396
00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:29.790
And how do you deal with the lack of trust that creates amongst conservatives

397
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.680
to which Mark Zuckerberg replied? I think having balances valuable.

398
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:38.400
And while we, and we try to do that.dot dot,

399
00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:41.550
I am not aware of the example of you say,

400
00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:45.480
have someone in charge of this process who worked for Biden in the past.

401
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:49.290
So we can follow up on that. Well, it is in fact,

402
00:22:49.291 --> 00:22:54.030
true that the person in charge of integrity and security at Facebook, uh,

403
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.460
that they are a former Biden staffer. Now, of course,

404
00:22:56.461 --> 00:22:59.100
that shouldn't really surprise you. And by the way,

405
00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:02.100
I don't necessarily begrudge people moving from say,

406
00:23:02.101 --> 00:23:04.630
being a political staffer to having a,

407
00:23:04.631 --> 00:23:08.310
another job or working at big tech and people move bounce around between

408
00:23:08.311 --> 00:23:10.920
industries and all of those things. But in this case,

409
00:23:10.921 --> 00:23:14.940
and especially in this highly polarized world that we live in, it's like,

410
00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:16.830
if you don't think he's bringing some of those biases,

411
00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:18.750
if you don't think some of those are kind of getting in,

412
00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:21.690
getting into the system for the guy that's in charge of the election stuff at

413
00:23:21.691 --> 00:23:24.780
Facebook, you know, then, then I'd like to,

414
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.350
I'd like to sell you something because of course it's happening. Right.

415
00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.770
Of course it's happening. So the fact that Zuckerberg basically said,

416
00:23:31.771 --> 00:23:35.640
he wasn't aware, kind of tells you everything. And this is often, you know what,

417
00:23:35.641 --> 00:23:39.330
what's the famous line, the famous line, the buck stops with me. Right?

418
00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:41.280
Meaning that if you're in charge of something,

419
00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.830
you can't always blame everybody else. Oh no, no, no.

420
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:48.170
Is that low level staff or, Oh no, no, no. Is the janitor no. Oh,

421
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.200
part-time or did that at some point,

422
00:23:51.201 --> 00:23:54.770
the buck stops with you and that's why being in the position that Zuckerberg is

423
00:23:54.771 --> 00:23:58.730
in and being in the position that Jack Dorsey is in. These are not, um,

424
00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.890
I would say enviable positions to be in there.

425
00:24:00.891 --> 00:24:05.720
There were extraordinary problems that you can never fully solve

426
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:09.170
perhaps. And that in the case of, uh, Jack,

427
00:24:09.171 --> 00:24:12.890
he probably just got himself in a lot of trouble by, by lying under oath.

428
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:15.470
Ted Cruz caught him, wa watch our video from yesterday.

429
00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:19.640
If you're not sure what I'm talking about. Um, so look Zuckerberg saying,

430
00:24:19.641 --> 00:24:22.370
he's not aware. It's like, alright, I don't know if you're lying or not.

431
00:24:22.371 --> 00:24:24.410
If you're lying, then there's a problem. But if,

432
00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:27.830
if you are in that just shows that you're not really in charge of your company,

433
00:24:27.831 --> 00:24:32.450
like a decision. Well, who, who was in charge then? Like who made the decision?

434
00:24:32.451 --> 00:24:33.920
If not you, the CEO,

435
00:24:33.921 --> 00:24:37.880
I do believe that you've got to manage this entire unimaginably huge

436
00:24:37.881 --> 00:24:41.000
organization. So then who was in charge? Was it a VP?

437
00:24:41.001 --> 00:24:44.930
Was it someone in HR who made the decision? What was the thought process?

438
00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:48.800
And now do we have evidence that this person is manipulating things again,

439
00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:53.210
it's all too late for this election. So, so we shall see what, what happens.

440
00:24:53.211 --> 00:24:56.810
All right, guys, I'm going to jump right now. I got, I got a crazy day. Uh,

441
00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.050
I just shot a podcast with Glenn Beck. That'll be up over at the blaze, uh,

442
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:04.340
soon. Um, got a few other things we're shooting later this afternoon. Uh,

443
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:08.090
we are doing a direct message tomorrow. This is a five day a week week for us.

444
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:09.890
Uh, it's going to be a Q and a,

445
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:13.790
I suspect it'll be mostly about election stuff all with the Rubin report

446
00:25:13.791 --> 00:25:15.830
community. So you can submit a question.

447
00:25:15.831 --> 00:25:20.360
You can do it right now@rubinreport.com or download our iOS app or our Google

448
00:25:20.361 --> 00:25:24.800
play app. Just search Rubin report, neither one of the stores, uh, QA tomorrow.

449
00:25:24.801 --> 00:25:27.500
And then next week we're announcing our election coverage.

450
00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.890
I'm going to be doing some live stuff in studio with the daily wire guys.

451
00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:33.410
I'm going to be doing some stuff via the pipes,

452
00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.910
via the wires with the blaze guys.

453
00:25:34.911 --> 00:25:38.150
And then we're going to do at least one live stream the night of the election,

454
00:25:38.151 --> 00:25:40.490
probably two. And then, uh,

455
00:25:40.491 --> 00:25:43.820
when the election is not decided that night we'll be doing live streams every

456
00:25:43.821 --> 00:25:47.630
day from then until perpetuity until the earth explodes,

457
00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:51.320
which according to AOC is in about 11 years and six months.

458
00:25:51.321 --> 00:25:54.350
So it's going to be a, it's going to be a hectic time. Uh, all right, guys,

459
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.270
I'll see you tomorrow. And if you want to submit questions,

460
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:59.120
run over to Rubin report.com. Have a great day, everybody.
