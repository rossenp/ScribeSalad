00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.120
<v 0>It was becoming very clear that there are certain topics that you are not</v>

2
00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:05.910
allowed to research that you're not allowed to talk about or discuss,

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.490
even if you are a scientific expert in the field.

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.410
And one topic in particular that I had been following was the issue

5
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:15.660
of gender transition in children.

6
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:20.580
<v 1>I'm Dave Rubin,</v>

7
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.930

00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:28.490
YouTube channel and have clicked that pesky notification bell and joining me

9
00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:33.020
today is a neuroscientist who specializes in gender sex and

10
00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:36.470
sexual orientation, as well as the author of the new book,

11
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.420
the end of gender debunking the myths about sex and identity in

12
00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:44.810
our society. Dr. Deborah. So welcome back to the Rubin report.

13
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.570
<v 0>Hi Dave, thank you for having me again.</v>

14
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.730
<v 1>So I was checking right before I sat down to see when I had you on last and</v>

15
00:00:52.731 --> 00:00:56.240
it's, it's almost two years to the day. It's two years to the week.

16
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.440
And we were talking about much of the stuff that you wrote about in this book,

17
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.220
gender and the whole LGBT letter

18
00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:07.040
conglomeration and identity and all of these things.

19
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.460
And I remember when we sat down for the first time that a lot of people said,

20
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.440
Oh no, this trans stuff, this isn't real, nobody really cares about this stuff.

21
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.700
All these things.

22
00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:21.170
These are just made up things that only academics and you YouTube is care about

23
00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.250
flash forward two years to where we're at right now with your book coming out

24
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:29.630
this week. And it's like, this is one of the biggest issues around.

25
00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:34.280
So I guess my first question is it must feel pretty good to not be crazy, huh?

26
00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.950
<v 0>I guess so, but I've just so horrified by how everything has turned out. I mean,</v>

27
00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:41.990
I was really helped when I saw you two years ago.

28
00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:45.290
I remember things were just starting to pick up in the mainstream and I was

29
00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:48.110
still hoping there's still a chance maybe this is going to get caught.

30
00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:49.460
People are going to figure things out.

31
00:01:49.461 --> 00:01:52.520
We're going to be able to cut this off before it gets too crazy,

32
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.600
but it really has just gotten worse. And with the end of gender,

33
00:01:56.601 --> 00:01:59.360
I wrote that book really with the hope of trying to, again,

34
00:01:59.361 --> 00:02:03.350
bring more attention to these issues so that people might take them seriously

35
00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:06.230
and realize that, you know, we're not just a bunch of fringe,

36
00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:08.000
crazy people complaining about things.

37
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:12.110
These have real implications for people's lives, especially for young people.

38
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.980
And it's going to be really, really unfortunate and ugly in a few years.

39
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.451
<v 1>Yeah. All right.</v>

40
00:02:17.451 --> 00:02:21.650
So the book is really spectacular and you dive into what are considered some of

41
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:23.180
the most controversial topics of the day.

42
00:02:23.181 --> 00:02:25.190
So we're obviously going to get to all of that, but for,

43
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.550
for anyone watching this, that didn't see our first, uh, interview,

44
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.160
can you just do like a quick two minute sort of recap of your bio, of how,

45
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.750
of your training that led you to, to write this book?

46
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.290
<v 0>Right. So I, when I was in my PhD,</v>

47
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:43.880
so I have a PhD in sexual neuroscience research. I now work as a journalist.

48
00:02:43.881 --> 00:02:47.480
I write predominantly about the science of sex and gender also about politics

49
00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:51.950
and how politicization of scientific research is really doing society and a

50
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:52.813
disservice.

51
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.210
And I also write a lot about academic freedom because that's becoming an another

52
00:02:56.211 --> 00:02:59.950
problem that we're seeing. And so for myself, and the last few years of my PhD,

53
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:04.150
I had noticed that the political climate of academia was shifting.

54
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.990
And it was becoming very clear that there are certain topics that you are not

55
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:10.780
allowed to research that you're not allowed to talk about or discuss,

56
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.360
even if you are a scientific expert in the field.

57
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.310
And one topic in particular that I had been following was the issue

58
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:22.120
of gender transition in children. And so at that time,

59
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.160
every single mainstream news piece,

60
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.770
pretty much I could count on maybe one or two fingers,

61
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:28.420
the number of pieces that had come out,

62
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:31.900
criticizing this at that time said that the best way for,

63
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.580
for children who are gender dysphoric.

64
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.940
So they feel they're more like the opposite sex than the sex that they were born

65
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:41.230
as the best way forward for them was to socially transition at a young age,

66
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.160
younger being better. And that once they did transition, they flourished,

67
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.200
you know, the parents would say that they're doing so much better,

68
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.360
but from a scientific perspective,

69
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.990
all of the research literature suggests that it's actually better for these

70
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:56.080
children to wait until they reached puberty. There's a very,

71
00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:58.960
very high chance that they're going to outgrow the way they feel.

72
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.450
They're more likely grow up to be gay in adulthood.

73
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.610
And so I wrote an op-ed about this,

74
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.790
and I waited about six months because I didn't know if I really wanted to

75
00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:10.060
publish it because I knew it was going to, there's going to be a huge backlash.

76
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.750
And I asked a number of my mentors and colleagues, what I should do.

77
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.020
And I remember one of my mentors said to me, I asked him,

78
00:04:17.021 --> 00:04:18.670
should I wait until I have tenure?

79
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.210
Because at the time I had planned to stay in academia and I had a whole plan in

80
00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:24.040
terms of what I was going to do in terms of my research.

81
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:27.310
And he said that tenure would not protect me in this climate.

82
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:32.020
So I decided to publish that piece. And it, it was, uh,

83
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.690
it was a difficult time. I'm really glad I did it.

84
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.010
And I write in the book about, you know,

85
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:39.220
what that process was like for me and what it was like being mobbed really badly

86
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:42.730
for the first time. But once you get through your first mobbing, you're fine.

87
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.880
And you know, they, they can't stop me now.

88
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.560
<v 1>Yeah, it's funny because, uh, you know,</v>

89
00:04:49.561 --> 00:04:52.830
I've been through my own version of the mob thing and I feel the same way.

90
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.850
Once you get through it, you will survive. It's your it's going to hurt.

91
00:04:56.851 --> 00:05:00.450
It's going to suck all of that stuff. But once you get through it and survive,

92
00:05:00.451 --> 00:05:02.160
you will be stronger on the other side.

93
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.290
Could you just talk a little bit though about the reaction from

94
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.240
your colleagues because I'm still,

95
00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:13.980
I think a lot of people can't accept somehow that academia could be this

96
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:14.580
corrupt,

97
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.440
that when you write a paper using scientific evidence saying that,

98
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.300
you know, when you transition this young,

99
00:05:21.301 --> 00:05:25.980
it doesn't necessarily lead to a happier life and you use data and

100
00:05:25.981 --> 00:05:30.420
evidence to support that, that you still get hit from the other academics.

101
00:05:30.421 --> 00:05:33.510
Like I think people can't really the average person who's not in academia.

102
00:05:33.511 --> 00:05:36.900
Can't really understand how that happened to academia.

103
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.630
<v 0>Well, I would say within sex research, which was my discipline, um,</v>

104
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.290
it really has been like a Canary in the coal mine because we saw these issues,

105
00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:48.270
especially left-leaning science denial.

106
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.610
This has been an issue for decades in sexology,

107
00:05:50.611 --> 00:05:52.710
which is the scientific study of sex and gender.

108
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.770
So most of us in sexology are liberals.

109
00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:58.160
I consider myself still to be a and,

110
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.720
and I think my colleagues are just focused on doing good work as they should be.

111
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.820
So I wouldn't say not that you were saying this,

112
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:09.440
but I wouldn't say sex research necessarily themselves are corrupt in why they

113
00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:12.950
stay silent. It's more that they know they already have a target on their back.

114
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.450
Usually sexologists are dealing from science now coming from the right.

115
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.640
Cause usually not everyone on the right is, is,

116
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.080
has an issue with sex researchers.

117
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:24.590
But historically has been more on the right now that it's coming from the left.

118
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.710
It's like sex researchers don't know how to deal with it because in a lot of

119
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:31.700
cases, it's people on the same side as you. And you're you feel as though, well,

120
00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:34.400
is this really as important as calling out when the right comes after us?

121
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.070
So I think that's one layer of it. You know,

122
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:41.630
it's very competitive in academia and to get a tenure position is almost unheard

123
00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:45.560
of nowadays. So you're very busy, it's stressful. And then,

124
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.320
then you have these other academics and other disciplines who are not

125
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:51.950
scientific, not to say that they all have bad intentions,

126
00:06:51.951 --> 00:06:54.920
but they're starting to take over. They're the most vocal.

127
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.870
And they're getting a lot of support also,

128
00:06:56.871 --> 00:07:01.400
I would say by mainstream news outlets. So it, as time goes on, it feels,

129
00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:06.260
I think more and more like you have more to lose than to gain by speaking

130
00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:08.840
out. So why start speaking out now? And that's where,

131
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:09.860
that's how we got to where we are.

132
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.880
<v 1>So one of the things that I'm really amazed by,</v>

133
00:07:12.881 --> 00:07:16.210
and I've brought this up with a couple guests when I've talked about the trans

134
00:07:16.211 --> 00:07:16.930
issue,

135
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.930
I've talked about this with Douglas Murray and with Rob Smith and a couple of

136
00:07:19.931 --> 00:07:23.890
other people is that in many ways the trans movement now

137
00:07:23.891 --> 00:07:28.690
seems almost perversely anti gay,

138
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.540
meaning that if you're in a feminine young boy,

139
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:35.980
they would rather see you transitioned to be female

140
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:40.510
rather than accept that you actually are just a gay male.

141
00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:42.790
So I also think just for me personally,

142
00:07:42.791 --> 00:07:47.230
it's particularly weird because I played with GI Joes and transformers. So the,

143
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.460
so no one thought I was gay per se, right? But if I,

144
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.770
but I have friends that played that were boys that played with Barbies and

145
00:07:53.771 --> 00:07:57.910
people thought they were gay when, when they were five. And that if they now,

146
00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.680
even though there may be in their forties now,

147
00:07:59.681 --> 00:08:02.740
if they were growing up now and they were four years old,

148
00:08:02.741 --> 00:08:06.310
five years old doing that, they would have been put through transition.

149
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.000
And that seems sort of anti gay, doesn't it.

150
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.300
<v 0>A hundred percent, a hundred percent and myself,</v>

151
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.690
as we talked last time I was with you. I grew up in the gay community.

152
00:08:16.691 --> 00:08:17.920
I find this very upsetting.

153
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.520
<v 1>You're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about academia</v>

154
