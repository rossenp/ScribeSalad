1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.680
<v 0>I think if I were Trump's press secretary,</v>

2
00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:06.630
the one thing I would not want to be is blindsided and

3
00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:10.800
surprised. Um, and that's why I would never be Trump's press secretary.

4
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.060
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

5
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.560
<v 2>I know you're not a, a spokesman for the conservative movement as a whole,</v>

6
00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:26.960
but do you think conservatives, um,

7
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.400
maybe had some branding issues over the years that I think are actually,

8
00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:33.620
I think actually are melting away right now. I mean,

9
00:00:33.621 --> 00:00:35.810
I think I'm probably evidence of it, you know,

10
00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:39.710
when I go and you guys are all nice to me and I can talk and debate and all that

11
00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:43.850
good stuff, but that for a long time, maybe just the word conservative,

12
00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:46.340
it sounds kind of stodgy and old and it's like,

13
00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:49.850
why would a young person want to be conservative? Um, that,

14
00:00:49.851 --> 00:00:52.040
that actually some of that's actually changing right now.

15
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.530
<v 0>Absolutely. But it comes everything cycles through the decades.</v>

16
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.530
Um, you know, national review for me is my dad,

17
00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:04.190
I think was a subscriber since I was a little kid. Um,

18
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.430
I think he voted for Goldwater, I believe that's right. And so I,

19
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.370
I just grew up in that world on a ranch and individual responsibility and

20
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.440
state's rights. That was super important to all of us,

21
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.680
but certainly things have changed. For example, I think, um,

22
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.640
conservatives for a long time were considered people who were against the gay

23
00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:24.320
rights movement, um,

24
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.240
who were against gay marriage and over time.

25
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.970
And not that long a time, if you think about it in history over time,

26
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.290
that melted away.

27
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.020
And so that I think allowed for people to give conservatives

28
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.440
and a different look. But part of that is what are you comparing it to?

29
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.080
And if you are finding that you are out of sorts with

30
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.450
some of the nonsense on the left,

31
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.260
then you might take another look at conservatism and you look at somebody like,

32
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.860
um, uh, Dan Crenshaw, uh, the Congressman from Texas,

33
00:01:57.861 --> 00:02:01.280
I did his podcast this morning. Um, he's a younger,

34
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:04.400
different kind of conservative. And then you see him on Saturday night,

35
00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:09.200
live responding with grace and humor to Pete Davidson who had so,

36
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.330
um, you know, casually attacked him, um, mocking his war injury.

37
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.340
So there's a lot of great opportunity for conservatives, but

38
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.690
you know, it's a, it's a challenge, especially as you, Jen,

39
00:02:23.691 --> 00:02:27.620
there's all these different ways to communicate now. So how do you get to, um,

40
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.610
your ideas to be persuasive for a larger amount of people?

41
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:35.300
Especially younger people. That's a challenge, but I, I think it's,

42
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.050
I think it's going better than some in the media might think it is.

43
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.780
<v 2>Huh. Interesting. All right.</v>

44
00:02:41.781 --> 00:02:45.470
Now I'm going to ask you to put the press secretary cap on. So, uh,

45
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.690
I'll give you, I'll give you two things here. One,

46
00:02:47.691 --> 00:02:49.580
if you were Trump's press secretary,

47
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.810
would you want more responsibility and want him to reign it in a little bit,

48
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.220
a little bit and to if you were Biden's press secretary, uh,

49
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.040
would you want him these live streams that are in my humble opinion coming off

50
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.330
pretty terribly.

51
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.900
<v 0>I think if I were Trump's press secretary,</v>

52
00:03:06.901 --> 00:03:11.850
the one thing I would not want to be is blindsided and

53
00:03:11.851 --> 00:03:16.020
surprised. Um, and that's why I would never be Trump's press secretary,

54
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.290
but I already had that job. They're never going to ask me, but you know,

55
00:03:19.291 --> 00:03:24.090
I think that it's incredibly difficult to think about knowing an answer at

56
00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:24.391
11.

57
00:03:24.391 --> 00:03:29.280
O'clock giving that answer at 12 o'clock and having it undermined at 12:06 PM.

58
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.470
Um, but that is how he operates. Um, for some, some people love it.

59
00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:36.360
Some people think it's horrible. Um,

60
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.450
the biding question is a little bit more difficult.

61
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.820
I don't know what I would do.

62
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.350
They are in a real fix right now because Joe Biden is now the presumptive

63
00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:50.430
nominee. He's gotten no bang for that buck after Bernie Sanders dropped out,

64
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.100
everybody's sort of like, yeah, okay. Then buying and says,

65
00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:55.410
I'm going to start my VP search. And we're like, Oh, okay,

66
00:03:55.411 --> 00:03:59.460
well there's about 10 women that you might consider. So, Oh, well, I mean,

67
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.580
people are just so zeroed in on appropriately.

68
00:04:02.581 --> 00:04:06.180
So the health of the nation and the economic health of the nation.

69
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.740
And I think that if Biden were to come out and push too hard against president

70
00:04:10.741 --> 00:04:14.730
Trump right now and criticize the commander in chief and the time of a major,

71
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.410
not just a domestic crisis, a global crisis,

72
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.740
it would look like he was rooting for failure for the country.

73
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.430
So he's got to pick his spots very carefully and sharply.

74
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.490
And I just don't know if he's going to be able to do that.

75
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.950
<v 2>Do you sense though,</v>

76
00:04:31.951 --> 00:04:36.660
that some in the media are rooting for the collapse of the

77
00:04:36.661 --> 00:04:39.540
economy and just that they viewed this as, Oh, we,

78
00:04:39.541 --> 00:04:43.650
we didn't get Trump on Russia. We didn't get Trump on Ukraine,

79
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.780
impeachment, blah, blah, blah. That this, you don't think so, huh?

80
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.430
<v 0>No, I don't. I don't. I mean,</v>

81
00:04:53.431 --> 00:04:57.570
I consume a ton of news. Um, I'm not naive to the biases,

82
00:04:57.571 --> 00:05:00.300
but there's a lot of problems out there. I mean,

83
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.800
I just meant like the food lines,

84
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.020
it's just the video you can see from overhead a three mile long car line

85
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.290
to get food in, um, Miami,

86
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.370
a six mile long car line to get food in San Antonio. I mean that,

87
00:05:14.371 --> 00:05:16.320
those are just facts. Those are, those are happening.

88
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.080
And I don't think that they root for the failure.

89
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.030
They might root for president Trump to lose,

90
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.050
but I don't think that they root for failure for, for the peop for people.

91
00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:25.884
I really don't.

92
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.710
<v 2>Yeah. I hope you're right. I mean,</v>

93
00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:32.160
I see some people that are pretty mainstream voices that it's almost like they

94
00:05:32.161 --> 00:05:34.380
just want this thing to continue.

95
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.580
<v 0>Well, I mean, that was true during the financial crisis of 2008, right?</v>

96
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.950
They were like, Oh no, but it was like,

97
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.900
well that if you didn't shore up the banks

98
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.480
and you ended up with something worse than the great depression,

99
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.940
what would have been the better choice. And again, presidents,

100
00:05:50.941 --> 00:05:54.450
can't worry about that. President Trump has to again,

101
00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:58.400
lift his gate and not worry about the headline of the day,

102
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.920
lift his gaze, look out.

103
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:03.200
People are going to judge this for years and years and years.

104
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.960
Forget about what they're going to say within the next 24 hours.

105
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:10.370
Are you making the best decisions with the information you have at the time on

106
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:11.204
behalf of the nation?

107
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.780
And can you defend that decision then that's a decision you should make.

108
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.110
You should defend it as much as you can and promote it, whatever you need to do,

109
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.900
but I wouldn't get so mired in, Oh,

110
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:25.460
they're against me because I think self-pity in politics is pretty pathetic and

111
00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:28.970
pitiful and you just need to win that.

112
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.300
Just have to try harder to win the arguments. It's just takes a lot more effort.

113
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.310
That's why I always tell companies,

114
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.170
if you think you're going to have some problems,

115
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.770
always hire somebody that's worked in Republican politics or communications

116
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:42.200
because guaranteed they've had to work harder.

117
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.730
<v 2>They've been through it once or twice. Yeah. Yeah. Do you think,</v>

118
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.670
do you think that Trump, those sorta needs that in a way, like,

119
00:06:51.671 --> 00:06:55.990
it's almost like him and Jim Mecosta are just like a match made in hell sort of

120
00:06:55.991 --> 00:06:56.201
thing.

121
00:06:56.201 --> 00:07:00.700
Like CNN needs it for eyeballs and Trump needs it because that's like sort of

122
00:07:00.701 --> 00:07:01.990
what gives him juice.

123
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.120
<v 0>It's a symbiotic relationship. Yeah.</v>

124
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.120
The symbiotic relationship they feed off of each other. Um,

125
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:13.210
but I was watching a press conference recently and I could,

126
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.600
I heard myself saying, that's a ridiculous question. That's a dumb question.

127
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.310
But look, our founding fathers were really, really brilliant.

128
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:26.260
And the first amendment was first for a reason because it's most important.

129
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.530
So we have to safeguard it. And if they want to ask stupid questions,

130
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.630
that's so be it.

131
00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.450
<v 2>All right. I got two more for you.</v>

132
00:07:34.451 --> 00:07:36.850
And then I know you got to go do the five cause you do have it.

133
00:07:36.851 --> 00:07:39.520
You do have a day job too. Uh, so one I've,

134
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.060
I've been joking for about two years. People always say to me, you know, Dave,

135
00:07:43.061 --> 00:07:46.630
do you want, are you going to get into politics? And I always say, no,

136
00:07:46.631 --> 00:07:50.050
but if Ben Shapiro becomes president,

137
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.730
I will be his press secretary. Is that crazy thing for me to say,

138
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.320
do you think that's a crazy thing?

139
00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:01.990
<v 0>I've never said this out loud, but I told Ben Shapiro,</v>

140
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.140
if he becomes president, I would come be his chief of staff.

141
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.490
<v 2>Well, I would be thrilled to work with you.</v>

142
00:08:09.491 --> 00:08:11.590
So maybe we are putting the pieces together here.

143
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.730
<v 0>Oh, this is going to come back to bite us both. You know what?</v>

144
00:08:15.731 --> 00:08:17.560
We're going to begin those jobs in the soup.

145
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.600
<v 2>Oh, just to see you thought you were going to get out and they pull you. Right.</v>

146
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.510
<v 0>That's so funny. I never said that out loud, but it's true.</v>

147
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.190
<v 2>All right. So that aside now, the really the most important thing,</v>

148
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:34.390
where is Jasper and tell us about Jasper and let's see, Jasper.

149
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.770
<v 0>Jasper is eight years old. He is here, Jennifer. Hey, can you come here? Come,</v>

150
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.120
come.

151
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.100
<v 2>Clyde always gets shy when I'm on your show.</v>

152
00:08:42.101 --> 00:08:43.540
So let's see if Jasper can show him.

153
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:47.410
<v 0>So Jasper has been on TV a lot since he was a kid. Come on. Since he was a kids.</v>

154
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:52.330
Um, since he was born, come up to say hi to your people.

155
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.040
Come on up. There we go. This is Jasper.

156
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.610
<v 2>Oh, look at this. Look, wait, no, you're not going to do it. Come on,</v>

157
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.390
look at Jasper. He's gorgeous. He's eight years old. Come on, Clyde.

158
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:04.224
What are you doing?

159
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.860
<v 0>Oh, here's our.</v>

160
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.840
<v 2>Come on. There we go. All right. We're halfway there.</v>

161
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.190
<v 0>One of the things that I've found Dave is that Nope, come stay.</v>

162
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:18.080
That dogs are a great equalizer. There's no politics at the dog park for me.

163
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:18.920
Um,

164
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:23.600
we all love our dogs and they gave us a lot of joy and um,

165
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:27.200
you know, whatever, love you, give them, you get back five times in return.

166
00:09:27.201 --> 00:09:32.150
I'm so, so glad that you two plunged back in and rescued

167
00:09:32.151 --> 00:09:33.650
Clyde. Um,

168
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.210
it makes me happy for you and your household and for Clyde in particular.

169
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.390
<v 2>And I told you it, literally I had him, like,</v>

170
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.420
he was like the second day I had him and I'm walking him down the street and

171
00:09:44.421 --> 00:09:47.360
this guy who was my neighbor for years, who I've seen for years,

172
00:09:47.361 --> 00:09:49.820
but never said hello to, he goes, Oh, that's Clyde.

173
00:09:49.821 --> 00:09:54.080
I just saw him on Dana Perino show. So we're making the world a better place.

174
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.080
<v 0>I love that. I really like getting to know you.</v>

175
00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.640
<v 2>Yeah, same here. Well, thanks for, thanks for doing good work in,</v>

176
00:10:01.641 --> 00:10:05.360
in the midst of this craziness and showing people that you can be human and

177
00:10:05.361 --> 00:10:09.440
still like politics and, uh, and taking good care of Jasper.

178
00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:10.460
So have a great day.

179
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.880
