WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.580
<v 0>I did a podcast on this. And, uh,</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.490
we're I think it was a week and a half ago where I really,

3
00:00:05.491 --> 00:00:10.380
I do 30 minutes of timeline on exactly who was saying, what, at what time,

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.660
I'm not trying to make excuses for Trump here.

5
00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:14.580
I just want people to understand the truth.

6
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.720
<v 2>I'm Dave Rubin, and this is the Rubin report reminder guys.</v>

7
00:00:26.721 --> 00:00:30.620
You can get all of our episodes days early and totally ad-free at Rubin

8
00:00:30.621 --> 00:00:34.310
report.com. And joining me today is a former Navy seal.

9
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.170
The Congressman from Texas, his second district and author of fortitude,

10
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.910
American resilience in the era of outrage, Congressman Dan Crenshaw.

11
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.010
Finally, welcome to the Rubin report.

12
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.470
<v 0>Great to be with you, Dave, we've.</v>

13
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.530
<v 2>Been trying to pull this off for a long time, but I guess it took,</v>

14
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.330
it took a pandemic to, uh,

15
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.600
for us to accept Skype as the only way we could make it happen.

16
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.700
<v 0>Yeah, that's true. I was supposed to come through LA for, uh, my book tour,</v>

17
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:05.300
as you know, we had some events planned together, but, um, you know,

18
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.070
life happens, right?

19
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.260
<v 2>Life happens, indeed. It does. All right. Well,</v>

20
00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:12.500
let's start with the stuff that we got to get out of the way, no matter what,

21
00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:14.900
before we get into the book and your story and everything else,

22
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.010
which is just Corona virus, sort of where we're at,

23
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:23.720
I'm really curious your thoughts on the stimulus package and the way we watched

24
00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:26.300
it sort of unfold, but just generally,

25
00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:31.130
can you talk about what it's like to be in Congress right now in a time of truly

26
00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:33.020
unprecedented happenings?

27
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.540
<v 0>Yeah, it's odd in the same way that it's probably odd for everybody else.</v>

28
00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:42.860
You're trying to continue doing your job. Hopefully you still have your job and,

29
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.550
but you're trying to do it from home. You're trying to, to,

30
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.860
to be as effective as you were before, but you're,

31
00:01:47.861 --> 00:01:52.820
but you're doing it from home. Uh, and that's, that's difficult. Um, uh,

32
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.950
more psychologically than, than logistically,

33
00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:59.240
we can make an app and logistically our office is still operating as normal. Um,

34
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.770
the there's,

35
00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:05.270
there's the frustrating thing about how this has played out from a congressional

36
00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:09.380
standpoint is, is how the partisan games didn't really stop.

37
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.310
And w whereas we maybe thought they would, uh, we,

38
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.060
I think I had some hope that they would mostly because they, they were stopping,

39
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.010
uh, to an extent, I I'll,

40
00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:23.900
I'll never forget Chuck Schumer on TV that Saturday and late February talking

41
00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:27.860
about how bipartisan this rescue package was going, and it was going well,

42
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.540
good talks. He said, who? He said, surprisingly good bipartisan talks.

43
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.700
And then it all blew up the next day. And he quickly shifted tax and, and,

44
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.390
uh, and, and went right along with Pelosi's demands of, uh,

45
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.760
this crazy progressive wishlist. Ultimately, the,

46
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.980
the package went through days later, um, after millions of jobs have been lost,

47
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.100
but ultimately went through, and it was basically the same package.

48
00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:55.940
Anybody who argues otherwise as being totally intellectually dishonest, um,

49
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.090
you know, the changes were minor and could have been agreed to that weekend.

50
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.370
That was extremely disappointing. That was also a turning point. I think,

51
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.110
I think we all noticed a turning point,

52
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:07.630
right then that came from the left-wing media.

53
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:11.380
And that turning point was Trump is to blame for millions of deaths.

54
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.590
That's right. That was the new, that was the,

55
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.080
that's been the new narrative and it hasn't stopped. Um,

56
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.890
and in fact it shifts slightly. Okay. Um, you know,

57
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:25.810
you saw it shift from, uh, from saying, Hey, there's a,

58
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:29.170
the Trump's travel restrictions from China. Weren't really travel restrictions.

59
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.930
It was, you know, he could have done more. All right. Well,

60
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:35.020
that's a dishonest talking point because the reality is the people coming from

61
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:38.290
China after January 31st were American citizens or green card holders.

62
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.200
So now you're going to have to explain to me why we shouldn't be repatriating

63
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:45.670
our own citizens. Okay. I mean, is it just really disingenuous or remarks?

64
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.960
Um, now the new talking point is that they didn't do anything in February. Okay,

65
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:53.050
fine. So the travel restriction was good. We agree with that,

66
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.870
even though we didn't at the time. And even though Democrats were in charge,

67
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.930
they never would have put those travel restrictions then fine.

68
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.120
But Trump didn't do anything in February,

69
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:04.420
except for except deny the whole thing. Well, again,

70
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.400
is this really an honest talking point? Um, you know, with 2020 hindsight,

71
00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:10.930
could we have done more? Yes.

72
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.370
But with the facts that we had at the time I questioned what,

73
00:04:14.371 --> 00:04:17.440
what exactly you think they should have done, um,

74
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.520
more PPE production and ventilator production, more testing production. I,

75
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.010
I agree with all of that. I just don't think it's,

76
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.550
I just don't think it's reasonable to be looking back in time and saying you

77
00:04:27.551 --> 00:04:30.280
made this decision differently than I would have made this decision,

78
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.600
because that's just not true.

79
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.360
<v 2>That the toughest part of doing what you guys have to do in terms of preparing</v>

80
00:04:36.361 --> 00:04:37.200
for something like this,

81
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.770
because right now the hindsight thing is just driving me crazy when you hear it

82
00:04:40.771 --> 00:04:41.760
from the media that, Oh,

83
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.390
suddenly they're saying everybody knew this was coming in February.

84
00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:47.610
And it's like, you know, there were, I think three,

85
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.720
possibly four democratic debates in February. The last one in February,

86
00:04:51.721 --> 00:04:53.100
I believe was February 25th.

87
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.370
It was coronavirus was not mentioned in any of them.

88
00:04:56.371 --> 00:05:01.260
It wasn't mentioned until the one where they only had Biden and Bernie in a

89
00:05:01.261 --> 00:05:04.950
room alone because of coronavirus that was already into March.

90
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.520
So you see everybody it's like, yeah, now that we see the score of the game,

91
00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:10.920
yeah. We can tell you everything that you did wrong before,

92
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.610
but that's not really how you can prepare as a, as a government.

93
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.900
<v 0>A hundred percent true. I I'm about to release a video on,</v>

94
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.790
on this exact thing. Um, I did a podcast on this and, uh, we're,

95
00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.370
I think it was a week and a half ago where I really,

96
00:05:26.371 --> 00:05:31.230
I do 30 minutes of timeline on exactly who is saying, what, at what time,

97
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.510
I'm not trying to make excuses for Trump here.

98
00:05:33.511 --> 00:05:37.740
I just want people to understand the truth and you made another good point.

99
00:05:37.741 --> 00:05:39.810
I didn't even bring up that point in my timeline of like,

100
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.070
they weren't talking about this. Nobody was talking about this in late February,

101
00:05:44.071 --> 00:05:48.030
Pelosi and DeBlasio were telling people to go celebrate the Chinese new year,

102
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.970
go out, don't be afraid, and I'm not blaming them.

103
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.460
They had the same set of facts that we all did.

104
00:05:53.461 --> 00:05:56.220
I don't think they're responsible for people's deaths either. I think,

105
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.400
I think this is a bad situation that we didn't quite expect. I also point out,

106
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.930
you know, in Italy, they didn't shut down their society until March 10th, Spain,

107
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:10.730
not until March 14th, uh, that's way later than February,

108
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.050
as it turns out, you know, we,

109
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.140
we did our 15 days to slow the spread on March 16th.

110
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.170
Iran didn't even start until April 4th,

111
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.970
Sweden still hasn't started and probably never will. Um, you know, there's just,

112
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.780
these are really disingenuous attacks. And as it pertains to something like PPE,

113
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.840
even with hindsight, no, it,

114
00:06:28.841 --> 00:06:32.000
it's not obvious that the PPE shortage was going to be there.

115
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:36.290
It's not like I think people simplify what information government officials

116
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:40.070
truly have and are capable of having. It's not like,

117
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.780
it's not like there's this final tally of N 95 mass and the government just

118
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:47.810
knows what they are and knows what they'll need. Well, no, I mean,

119
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.160
hospitals are also responsible for stockpiling in Houston. Uh we're well,

120
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:54.560
stockpiled, maybe because we've been through a lot of,

121
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.190
we've been through pandemics before we've been through hurricanes before our

122
00:06:58.191 --> 00:06:59.420
hospital system, uh,

123
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.270
operates a little bit differently than maybe another hospital system that

124
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.510
doesn't feel they need a bunch of N 95 Massey.

125
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.670
That's not necessarily the federal government's fault. And again,

126
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.000
if we really want to point fingers, if we really want to go down this road,

127
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.080
I will point you to all the fact checkers that have confirmed that it's really

128
00:07:15.081 --> 00:07:19.040
the Obama administration that didn't replenish our national stockpile then of,

129
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.160
of 95 mass after the H one N one virus.

130
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.130
But should I really blame them? I mean, that's another question,

131
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.950
but I really believe blaming blaming the Obama administration,

132
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.600
what crystal ball do they have

133
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.720
things they spent it on radiological protection and things like that. They,

134
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.250
you know, th th there's no ill intent here. And, uh,

135
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.240
and I would also point out that our hospital system has been strained,

136
00:07:44.241 --> 00:07:45.680
but not broken. Uh,

137
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.790
nobody has been denied a ventilator unlike in places in Europe. Why? Because,

138
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.060
well, it turns out our profit driven healthcare system, uh,

139
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.700
has an excess of things like ventilators and ICU beds. I,

140
00:07:56.701 --> 00:08:00.320
I went through the numbers on this, on a per capita basis.

141
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.400
The us has way more orders of magnitude,

142
00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:08.000
more ICU beds and ventilators than any of these, uh,

143
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.930
Western countries or countries in Europe, any of them, including Germany.

144
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.410
And that's a product of our healthcare system.

145
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:19.130
It's an imperfect healthcare system. I wish it was different in a lot of ways,

146
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:24.260
but socialized medicine means less supply because you're basically saying

147
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:27.200
price controls and people need to understand these basic facts as we,

148
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.020
as we judge what could have been done and what should have been done.

149
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:31.573
So speaking of.

150
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.890
<v 2>Could have been done what should've been done.</v>

151
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.780
Can you just explain a little bit about how information actually gets

152
00:08:37.781 --> 00:08:38.710
to you guys?

153
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.850
Like how does it get to a member of Congress that say in January,

154
00:08:42.851 --> 00:08:47.710
there's sort of these initial reports of something going on? Trump does the, uh,

155
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:50.920
initial shutdown. I think it was on Jan last day of January, I think.

156
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:55.210
But like when does something actually get to your desk and how do you actually,

157
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.220
Oh, now this is something I got to talk to somebody about,

158
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:02.640
or do you pass it on to somebody and say, does this study make sense?

159
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:04.740
Or is anyone else seeing these reports?

160
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:08.700
Like how does some of that information actually turn into something actionable?

161
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.520
<v 0>Yeah, that's an interesting question. Um, w we,</v>

162
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:17.150
we don't have a whole lot of secret lines of information that the public doesn't

163
00:09:17.151 --> 00:09:22.130
have. Oftentimes members of Congress are really operating off of the same set of

164
00:09:22.131 --> 00:09:25.790
facts that most, uh, people in the media are,

165
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.770
or most members of the public. Uh, the difference is we,

166
00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:34.880
we have sets of professionals that we can rely on to sift through all of the

167
00:09:34.881 --> 00:09:39.620
information and, and place that against prior policy,

168
00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:40.040
uh,

169
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:44.900
compare that against prior legislation and talk about it in legislative terms.

170
00:09:44.901 --> 00:09:48.980
This is we, we, we, we have, I just have a team that helps me do that, so that,

171
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.730
you know, I, I'm not, uh, I'm not a journalist trying to do it all myself.

172
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.610
And so, uh, that's a huge advantage as far as,

173
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.790
as sifting through the information and making sure that we get it correct.

174
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.180
