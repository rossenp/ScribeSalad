1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.270
<v 0>I was more willing to engage lock antlers. When I was young,</v>

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.480
I don't think people are going to change their minds anymore.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.310
I don't want to be the carnival Barker on some freak show. People were split.

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.930
We'll find out where we go,

5
00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:17.010
which way at each election in between it's going to be contentious. Uh,

6
00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:21.090
at age 66. I don't want to wake up every day and fight with people about stuff.

7
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:22.800
They're not going to change their mind on anyway.

8
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.190
<v 2>I'm Dave Rubin and this is the Rubin report reminder.</v>

9
00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:36.410
Everybody subscribed to Rubin report.com.

10
00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:40.430
If you want to get all our videos early and totally ad free and more

11
00:00:40.431 --> 00:00:44.690
importantly, joining me today as a stand-up comic and host of Dennis Miller,

12
00:00:44.691 --> 00:00:49.640
plus one on the RT network, as well as the Dennis Miller option podcast,

13
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.380
Dennis Miller, I've already said your name three times.

14
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.680
<v 0>What's up rubes. Welcome to the Rubin report. Beautiful pad here, man.</v>

15
00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:58.640
I'm trying to read, you can tell a man by his books and his chotchkies.

16
00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:00.830
I see that you're a Carlin fan,

17
00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:03.680
which I find in a little Steven Pinker NBA.

18
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.580
I think your detractors would say this indicates you're moving rightward towards

19
00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:10.580
John Birch participation on the bottom.

20
00:01:10.581 --> 00:01:15.440
Where do you have the map centered up that odd confluence between South America

21
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.670
and, uh, or the globe?

22
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.300
I should say South America and Africa where it's split up. And I have a theory.

23
00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:23.960
It looks like they were together at one point yes, slips split apart.

24
00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:28.430
And obviously the West coast of Africa with, uh, uh, ivory coast.

25
00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:32.100
Liberia is the most contentious place in the planet. And I think that's a, uh,

26
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.180
sudden hard drive tremble from way back when,

27
00:01:35.181 --> 00:01:37.910
where a guy went out into his yard in Liberia once and said, honey,

28
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:40.040
what's this crack. And then two weeks later.

29
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.380
<v 2>I've often wondered how Pangea split. Now I have a little,</v>

30
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.740
I'm giving you a little something of everything here because we got lefties.

31
00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:51.080
We got right. He's look, I got an American flag and the controller.

32
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.490
<v 0>I always love to have a map in my studio to feel situated. Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.960
<v 2>So you got two shows. You've done a budget things I said to you right before.</v>

34
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:00.980
I'm not even gonna use notes.

35
00:02:00.981 --> 00:02:04.040
I try not to really look at my notes when I talk to most guests. Anyway,

36
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.900
I thought I'd just sit down and see what happens.

37
00:02:05.901 --> 00:02:07.850
You kind of just need to be wound up and then, yeah.

38
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.320
<v 0>Right. Well, you know what, but I tell you, as I get older,</v>

39
00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:17.180
I need to be wound up and let go less. I just listen. It's contentious. Now.

40
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:21.170
I was more of a, I don't want to use the it's a tired term firebrand,

41
00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:24.470
but I was more willing to engage lock antlers. When I was young,

42
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.680
I don't think people are going to change their minds anymore.

43
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.480
I don't want to be the carnival Barker on some freak show. People were split.

44
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.260
We'll find out where we go, which way at each election in between,

45
00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:39.200
it's going to be contentious. Uh, at age 66.

46
00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:42.290
I don't want to wake up every day and fight with people about stuff.

47
00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:45.770
They're not going to change their mind on anyway. So when I get going,

48
00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:50.360
I like to put on a good show. You know, your, uh, your Spanky and our gang.

49
00:02:50.361 --> 00:02:51.350
Let's put on a show.

50
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.680
<v 2>I don't need the, I don't need to get going as much anymore.</v>

51
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.410
So you're like an evolved political satirist or.

52
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.480
<v 0>Something. I just, uh, I used to dig the game.</v>

53
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:05.230
When you could budge somebody in an angstrom, I didn't need them to come over.

54
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:07.090
I never thought did you gotta to talk to somebody?

55
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:11.260
And they were going to desert their core beliefs and come over your way.

56
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.710
But they, at least you could see the mulling. I think Mullings gone.

57
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:18.760
I could see M's gone. It's just now people know nobody's,

58
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.870
everybody's dug in and I ain't mad. I'm trying over here. I appreciate it.

59
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:25.900
But like I said, I don't know you're in your forties, right?

60
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:27.550
I would've probably fought the flop more then,

61
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.450
but I'm telling you why you seem like, uh, just the time we talked beforehand,

62
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:33.940
you seem like a smart enough, got that somewhere down the road.

63
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:37.030
I can't see you fighting it into the barn. Seem to be alone. You know,

64
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.600
it was a beautiful family. And the picture out here got a great place.

65
00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:43.930
You're kicking and taking names. Career-wise yeah, you should do it now.

66
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.690
But at some point the harvest is, uh,

67
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.220
you're going to do I'm into getting up and reading, taking a hike,

68
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.300
having a good meal,

69
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.990
appreciating the fact that I married the most beautiful Woody charming girl I

70
00:03:55.991 --> 00:03:57.850
ever met, uh, adoring.

71
00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:00.550
My son's watching some baseball and then reading his life.

72
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.140
<v 2>Fall out the sleep. Is that a tough thing though? For a comic to have to face?</v>

73
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.010
Not for me.

74
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.280
But do you think for most comics that's like you almost fear that you fear the

75
00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:11.580
okayness cause you won't have the fuel. It's a FINI.

76
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.700
<v 0>Job. Yeah, I I'm. I was never very, uh,</v>

77
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.290
I don't know if you show businesses some sword from the stone moment where

78
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.450
you're anointed job. I grew up in Pittsburgh and uh, my job, uh,

79
00:04:24.451 --> 00:04:26.580
what I was good at was, uh,

80
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.120
I would think jokes up and then I tried to give those jokes to somebody else to

81
00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:32.850
do. And then I found I didn't have the ego for that.

82
00:04:32.851 --> 00:04:34.290
Once I saw somebody do a joke,

83
00:04:34.291 --> 00:04:37.200
I thought up on the tonight show and Carson laughing.

84
00:04:37.201 --> 00:04:40.530
I thought I'm not built for this. I better become the unlikely conduit,

85
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.090
but I've never thought of myself as the silver surfer convenient.

86
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.790
Yeah. And so, no, I don't, I don't have any moment pangs or anything. Oh,

87
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.140
I wish I was in the fray.

88
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.790
It never was like that when I was in the fray where you always a political

89
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.720
cause I thought I should get that job on SNL. You have to become political.

90
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.880
<v 2>So you weren't political before I used to be a.</v>

91
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.640
<v 0>Prop comic. I remember working with the, I, you know,</v>

92
00:05:05.641 --> 00:05:10.350
I was never quite character opion but I met him actual word.

93
00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:13.710
I think that's probably in the dictionary now. That's depressing. I, uh,

94
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.880
I did props when I first started. Cause I thought that visually that way,

95
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.700
but then I remember I couldn't fit the props in the overhead.

96
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.890
I had slight props and then I thought, you know,

97
00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:24.550
I'm not going to wait a half hour at a.

98
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.220
<v 2>Right. So for some inflatable I could.</v>

99
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.380
<v 0>Put on my head and say, alas for turning</v>

100
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.750
That on, that started writing jokes. Like I said,

101
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.610
stoled a couple of other comedians,

102
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.440
saw them do them and score with them and thought I've got to be the guy. So, um,

103
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.950
I, like I said, it was very, uh,

104
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.000
I didn't have a whoosh whoosh thing about standup. I remember thinking, okay,

105
00:05:51.001 --> 00:05:51.960
this is a good career.

106
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.790
<v 2>Kind of a decision. So when you get the weekend updates situation,</v>

107
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.240
the S and L situation, then it's sorta like it was political. What, what,

108
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.870
what year did you start at SNL? Somewhere in the eighties. Somewhere,

109
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.733
somewhere in there.

110
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.830
<v 0>No, I'm not doing that deliberately. Just, uh, I remember I was, uh,</v>

111
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.910
mainly Hmm.

112
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.940
<v 2>Nine or something. Cause I'm trying to remember cause you on SNL, that,</v>

113
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.710
that class was like my formative comedy year class. So I was like 12,

114
00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:21.070
13 around then. And I think, I think maybe like 89 or something.

115
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.520
<v 0>Okay. Well, some people think of themselves as comedic visionaries.</v>

116
00:06:24.521 --> 00:06:28.540
I choose to think of ourself as ushering kids through puberty. We as a yeah.

117
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.630
<v 2>If you were 12 or yeah, that's all we were,</v>

118
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.740
that was 15 minutes off from jerking off. But you guys did it.

119
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.110
I made it out. Okay.

120
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:44.050
But I remember I was in Baltimore and I had auditioned for SNL maybe a

121
00:06:44.051 --> 00:06:44.884
month before.

122
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.920
<v 0>And then I remember, um,</v>

123
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.850
they pick the cast USA today had picture of him.

124
00:06:51.851 --> 00:06:55.360
I wasn't in and I was still in Baltimore and I was so tough at that point,

125
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.540
because on your way up, you have to be tough. I did stand up in New York,

126
00:06:58.541 --> 00:07:02.890
12 years. I was a gladiator. And I remember seeing that picture.

127
00:07:02.891 --> 00:07:06.250
I didn't have a crestfallen thing. I think I came close to that. All right,

128
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.330
keep going. Uh, then I was up doing Letterman and uh,

129
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.920
somebody came into the Letterman dressing room and said, uh, listen,

130
00:07:14.921 --> 00:07:19.000
Lauren Michaels wants to see you on eight or no 17 where his office was.

131
00:07:19.001 --> 00:07:21.310
And I said, geez, I knew something was that.

132
00:07:21.311 --> 00:07:24.160
He's not calling me down to revisit me to tell me why he didn't it to me,

133
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.240
really not getting it.

134
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.560
But I'm thinking maybe I get a shot on it as a comedian or something like Steven

135
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.370
Wright would come on Sam once in a while. So, um, I went down,

136
00:07:33.371 --> 00:07:36.090
I knew it was going to be something good. But then I walked in.

137
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.260
I remember it's one of those moments that stick in your head.

138
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.760
Lauren sits at the end of the thing.

139
00:07:39.761 --> 00:07:43.990
He's got one of those green dome to glasses, uh, lights on his desk, you know,

140
00:07:43.991 --> 00:07:46.240
that gives it that Arthur Conan, Doyle feel.

141
00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.840
And he's got the quarter glasses on reading scripts or something.

142
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.120
And I over his shoulders, the empire state building.

143
00:07:52.121 --> 00:07:55.480
And I remember it being like red, white, and blue.

144
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.630
And it was important to July or anything, but he looks up and he goes,

145
00:07:58.631 --> 00:08:00.820
Hey Dennis Miller. I go, Hey Lauren. He says,

146
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.580
how would you like to do a weekend update? And I said, I'd like that a lot.

147
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.520
I said, I'll see you tomorrow around 11. I said, all right, sir,

148
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.880
I walked out and then I remember thinking I'm not a big drinker,

149
00:08:09.881 --> 00:08:12.940
but I remember thinking I'm going to go get four fingers of something Brown on

150
00:08:12.941 --> 00:08:16.480
the rocks and knock this down because this is pivotal. And, uh,

151
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.990
that was magical. I don't want to act like I'm sitting over here, like Putin,

152
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:23.980
I'm talking about standup. I was kind of step-by-step ImageNow line,

153
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.820
move it six inches fallback for move it for. But when that happened,

154
00:08:27.821 --> 00:08:30.460
I remember thinking, all right, take some mental Polaroids here.

155
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.910
Don't be blahzay about this. Cause that's its own defense mechanism.

156
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.660
This is a big deal. Chevy chased it, this you're going to do it now.

157
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.890
Enjoy it until you either become a success or get whacked.

158
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.550
So I did enjoy it along the way. I took all those moments and you know,

159
00:08:45.551 --> 00:08:49.510
the first time you sit in that seat, yeah. Count your dad. I just thought,

160
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.380
all right, I might go up, but I'm going out on my shield here.

161
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:57.180
So even though you weren't purely political, they, they pegged you for that.

162
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.690
Where you is. That is that, is that what you wanted? Did you want to do more?

163
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.560
I wanted any hook. I didn't, I'm not a character guy.

164
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:09.270
I used to try to stay out of the SNL sketches because, uh, you know,

165
00:09:09.271 --> 00:09:13.790
when you're with geniuses, Carly's comedic, genius, love it's uh, the,

166
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.310
the sketch wise, a genius, Phil, the ultimate glue guy. Me,

167
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:20.520
the only guy I never thought I'd see a guy like Danny and Phil got in the room

168
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:22.830
with them. And I always thought, wow, this is a serious play.

169
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.970
Mike Myers comes in. So you've got four leads there that could kill the ball.

170
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.840
I'm the fifth guy in a sketch. I'm the bartender saying, here's your Gimlet.

171
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:33.690
And yet I gotta be there blocking it for three and a half hours.

172
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.660
So I used to go around and say to writers when they wrote me in, I'd say,

173
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:41.160
I want to be like the DH. I want to pick a rock song.

174
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.530
They swing the weighted bat down the tunnel,

175
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.010
come out and hit the ball for 10 minutes. And by the end you had that, right?

176
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.160
Yeah. It was a groovy job. And I used to,

177
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.970
I probably been in around a dozen sketches over the years and they were ones

178
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:57.300
where I thought, Oh, this is good. I should stay in this because I want to see,

179
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.870
uh, I want to see this when I get older, uh, it's a wonderful life.

180
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.230
The next chapter, you know, you knew when something was going to be a big hit,

181
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.410
but by and large, I was really happy to have just weekend update.
