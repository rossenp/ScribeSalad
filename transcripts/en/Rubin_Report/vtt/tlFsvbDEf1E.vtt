1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.420
<v 0>Yeah, I think most of your audience can appreciate that if you,</v>

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.100
as a culture had a monopoly on the conversation for a century as the

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.550
Progressive's head and you start losing control of that monopoly,

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.290
it is going to look like chaos to you and your tension and fear is going to be

5
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:19.740
palpable. And that tension and fear is going to be contagious. So some,

6
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.930
so some very, very bad people are very,

7
00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:25.230
very worried about losing their stature and status in our society.

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.080
And that should make right thinking people very, very happy. Okay.

9
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.140
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

10
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.580
<v 2>It's locals week here on the Rubin report and I'm doing many interviews with</v>

11
00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:48.560
creators on why they decided to become less reliant on big tech and instead own

12
00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:52.670
their content and community and livelihood with locals.com.

13
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.050
Joining me today is the Willy Wonka of politics himself. Michael malice.

14
00:00:57.051 --> 00:00:59.420
Welcome back to the Rubin report. Thanks, Dave.

15
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.000
I thought you were going to be in one of your Michael malice.

16
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.740
Get-ups dressed as Tulsi Gabbert or Bea Arthur or somebody,

17
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.080
but you're just giving me regular malice. Oh no.

18
00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:13.820
I'm dressed like the little mermaid from the bottom down. Well,

19
00:01:13.821 --> 00:01:17.060
that's the mermaid part. Yeah, that's the mermaid part. All right. Malice.

20
00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:20.470
So before we get into why, uh, why you're on locals and,

21
00:01:20.471 --> 00:01:23.240
and you've had incredible success there actually. Um,

22
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.230
I thought I should probably give you a little credit because you've been

23
00:01:27.231 --> 00:01:30.620
predicting the disintegration of everything for quite some time.

24
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.420
And as a matter of fact, you relish in it,

25
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.100
but also point to a way that it will not be all horrible.

26
00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:39.740
And I think that's what people are worried about. Help me out with this.

27
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.550
<v 0>Yeah. I think most of your audience can appreciate that if you,</v>

28
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.230
as a culture had a monopoly on the conversation for a century as the

29
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:51.710
Progressive's head and you start losing control of that monopoly,

30
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.420
it is going to look like chaos to you and your tension and fear is going to be

31
00:01:56.421 --> 00:01:59.870
palpable. And that tension and fear is going to be contagious. So some,

32
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.060
so some very, very bad people are very,

33
00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:05.360
very worried about losing their stature and status in our society.

34
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.120
And that should make right thinking people very, very happy.

35
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.540
And this should be something that's an opportunity for hope. We, you know,

36
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:15.320
you don't tear down a building and it just, it's not like a snap of fingers.

37
00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:16.650
And then it's like a new buildings there.

38
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.460
There's going to have to be that transition period, which is going to be ugly.

39
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.160
So this ugliness is kind of like an a medic, you know,

40
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.590
if you've ever had it coming out both ends.

41
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.090
So that's basically what we're seeing. Uh,

42
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.430
the body politic is approaching itself of the poison. Yeah.

43
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.840
<v 2>What do you think it looks like, like, regardless of who wins,</v>

44
00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:35.660
perhaps you want to make a prediction, but like in a year from now,

45
00:02:35.661 --> 00:02:38.900
like when we get to that other side, the rebuild side, what do you,

46
00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:39.920
what do you think that looks like?

47
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.791
<v 0>Well,</v>

48
00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:43.670
the beauty of chaos is you have no idea where of knowing what's going to look

49
00:02:43.671 --> 00:02:48.260
like. I mean, I think we all remember in 2016, after Trump got elected,

50
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.570
we were like, w what does this mean? Like we,

51
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.440
none of us had any clue what a Donald Trump presidency would look like.

52
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.360
On the one hand, it could have been like an honor sports,

53
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.040
Niagara governorship of California,

54
00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.090
where he's kind of this like middle of the road, like lefty, Republican,

55
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:03.100
and ends up destroying the Republican party forever.

56
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.110
Or he could have gone full kind of Giuliani plus law and order

57
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.140
let's bring out the what shippers or the guillotines or whatever.

58
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.130
And it's kind of been a mix. A lot of it's much more rhetorical than otherwise.

59
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:17.410
But, uh, the other concern is, you know,

60
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:20.530
we don't know what a Biden presidency would look like. There's two scenarios.

61
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.380
One is Biden is going to be a moderate Democrat.

62
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.050
Biden has been very anti-crime in his career.

63
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.000
Biden is the one who took down Bernie Sanders,

64
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.900
not president Trump or Biden is going to be weak and ineffectual.

65
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.840
And what black lives matter is basically going to be running the country.

66
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:37.030
And our chief is going to be running the country, either scenarios,

67
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.500
and the course can be packed and any kind of right-wing gains at a legal level

68
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:44.290
will be lost forever. So both of these scenarios are also plausible there.

69
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.440
So we have no way of knowing. All I know is that, uh,

70
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.340
people who are comfortable are going to be made uncomfortable,

71
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.650
and that historically is a good thing.

72
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.200
<v 2>But either way you want less of these people in our lives,</v>

73
00:03:58.201 --> 00:03:59.850
is that fair to say malice.

74
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.940
<v 0>Right? So when they're running around like chickens with their heads cut off,</v>

75
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.080
possibly, hopefully,

76
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.490
literally that is going to be good because when they're fighting each other and

77
00:04:08.491 --> 00:04:10.110
they can't get their stuff together,

78
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.430
that gives them less of an opportunity to try to inflict their schemes on us.

79
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.390
And here's another thing that should be very, very exciting for a lot of people,

80
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.580
Von Paul and then president Trump have legitimize the antiwar position within

81
00:04:23.581 --> 00:04:26.490
the Republican party, which had been the case before, uh,

82
00:04:26.491 --> 00:04:28.380
with the rise of neo-cons and George W. Bush,

83
00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:31.200
especially it became part and parcel of republicanism.

84
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.550
Imagine if Joe Biden without some sort of enormous nine 11 event,

85
00:04:35.551 --> 00:04:38.100
or even maybe with one God forbid sat down and,

86
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.950
or president Trump in a second term said, we're all going to war.

87
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.050
He would not have the ability to form that coalition that historically past

88
00:04:46.051 --> 00:04:46.884
presidents have.

89
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.940
So to have that chaos and that lack of ability to form a consensus is in this

90
00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:53.340
case, it literally saving hundreds of thousands of lives.

91
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.120
<v 2>Well, malice, it's that sort of insight. That's why I love you.</v>

92
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.470
That's why I quote you all the time. And you've been a, a voice,

93
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.530
an odd voice of reason somehow in these crazy times.

94
00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:08.460
And your book is right over there. It's right off camera right now. Any who, uh,

95
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.220
this is a good segue to sort of why you are on locals,

96
00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:16.050
because you were the third person on there. Um, and I, I hand selected you.

97
00:05:16.051 --> 00:05:16.501
I said,

98
00:05:16.501 --> 00:05:20.040
this guy will be perfect when we were just sort of seeding it just to who could

99
00:05:20.041 --> 00:05:21.780
be the test people. Um,

100
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.700
why did you think that doing something off big tech was going to be

101
00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:27.534
good for you?

102
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.010
<v 0>Oh, it was such a no-brainer and I was looking for an alternative.</v>

103
00:05:32.011 --> 00:05:36.990
I was on Patrion before and here are the advantages I had with locals.

104
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.970
I do not ever have to worry that I'm going to make a video or send

105
00:05:41.971 --> 00:05:45.690
out a tweet and have everything I've created vanished overnight.

106
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.510
I don't have to worry about not having a recourse. First of all,

107
00:05:48.511 --> 00:05:50.280
I could call you up or you would call me and be like, Hey,

108
00:05:50.281 --> 00:05:52.440
this is inappropriate. Let's figure this out. Number one.

109
00:05:52.441 --> 00:05:55.590
So now I have a call into the guy that's up, but number two is.

110
00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.000
<v 2>Right for the record. I certainly won't say that to you. It's your site.</v>

111
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.420
We're just giving you the tools. What you do with those tools is up to you,

112
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:03.254
my friend.

113
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.960
<v 0>Because we can flame it this time. No, but in all seriousness,</v>

114
00:06:07.961 --> 00:06:10.870
that was a huge advantage. Second. It, uh,

115
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.490
the vibe of locals is this was a place where me and people who like what I do

116
00:06:15.491 --> 00:06:20.470
and respect what I do are welcomed as opposed to being regarded as

117
00:06:20.471 --> 00:06:24.760
something to put up with and an embarrassment and something to apologize about.

118
00:06:24.761 --> 00:06:28.660
I don't think people appreciate to what extent the employees at let's suppose

119
00:06:28.661 --> 00:06:33.490
Spotify are driven crazy that their platform is

120
00:06:33.491 --> 00:06:38.140
being used to further the views of people that they regard as literal

121
00:06:38.141 --> 00:06:40.420
Nazis or Twitter or Facebook.

122
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:45.130
So when you have that kind of disconnect between the people running the site

123
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.360
and the creators who are in the Jewish, um, it's,

124
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.350
it's very reassuring to know you're not going to have to sit down with someone

125
00:06:53.351 --> 00:06:54.580
and explain, no,

126
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:57.670
I would have been against the Holocaust and would have been a victim.

127
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.170
<v 2>Yeah. So part of this of course, is that there's a paywall.</v>

128
00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:04.870
So I think you let you let you have a minimum, right?

129
00:07:04.871 --> 00:07:07.480
But you let people come on for whatever, whatever they want to pay.

130
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.700
And I know some people must be saying, but wait a minute,

131
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.010
Michael malice wrote a book called the new, right.

132
00:07:12.011 --> 00:07:14.470
He's an expert at what the trolls are up to.

133
00:07:14.471 --> 00:07:18.250
Why would he want to be in a place where there are no trolls because trolls

134
00:07:18.251 --> 00:07:19.084
won't pay?

135
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.530
<v 0>No, they, all, my followers at trolls were, I'm a professional troll. I,</v>

136
00:07:23.531 --> 00:07:26.020
I trolled the Kama Harris very successfully.

137
00:07:26.021 --> 00:07:28.120
I troll people all the time on Twitter,

138
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.710
trolling at its best is the art of exploiting someone's weaknesses and turning

139
00:07:32.711 --> 00:07:36.580
them into a former, uh, for the sake of the broader audience. So it is impish.

140
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.240
It is mischievous. It is fun. It is, it is very much Willy Wonka,

141
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:45.250
but it's not about being a hateful me just telling you, Hey, Dave, you're sob,

142
00:07:45.251 --> 00:07:47.380
or that that's not trolling. That's just being a jerk.

143
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.370
So I think people enjoy my followers, certainly.

144
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:56.050
And people support me enjoy how effective puncturing these balloons are

145
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.740
of these pompous people who have presumed to put themselves in a position of

146
00:07:59.741 --> 00:08:02.470
authority, despite being such mediocre people.

147
00:08:02.471 --> 00:08:06.010
Here's the 0.1 great example I frequently use. I'll just ask them,

148
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:10.720
have you ever considered the possibility that you're the bad guys and just that

149
00:08:10.721 --> 00:08:13.450
one simple question to the likes of these, you know,

150
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.770
operatives really gets people excited and gets them,

151
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.290
some of them, uh, to wonder, you know what,

152
00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:22.870
maybe I don't have it as much figured out as I'd like to think. I do.

153
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:23.740
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

154
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.640
Do you think the ship has totally sailed with big tech that we're basically just

155
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.980
at the end of it now? Like, you know,

156
00:08:29.981 --> 00:08:32.020
we all are on borrowed time there basically.

157
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.890
<v 0>No. Uh, but I think that, you know,</v>

158
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.740
at any time you have any industry it's going to,

159
00:08:38.741 --> 00:08:42.880
at first ossify into like four to 10, you know, major establishment,

160
00:08:42.881 --> 00:08:46.750
it was the case in publishing, you know, had six companies is the case in music.

161
00:08:46.751 --> 00:08:50.020
You know, he had a certain number of labels, but after a certain time,

162
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.470
like in music, like in self publishing and in the internet, uh,

163
00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.310
they might have a disproportionate of impact on the market,

164
00:08:56.311 --> 00:08:58.980
but they're not going to have that monopoly control, uh,

165
00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:02.010
that we're seeing to some extent. Now, the only people,

166
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:04.710
there's a very few people who are like completely, you know,

167
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:08.100
driven off the internet, uh, the rest they're, they're having issues with it.

168
00:09:08.101 --> 00:09:11.100
And the fact that you are creating a competitive advantage, uh,

169
00:09:11.101 --> 00:09:15.000
alternative to them really is an issue. Because just,

170
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:17.280
if I'm not political, why would I,

171
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:19.800
if I have to choose between Patrion and locals, right?

172
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:21.960
And they're both comparable in their advantages,

173
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.580
but this has the disadvantage of,

174
00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:27.960
I might lose my account overnight for some political reason. Whereas here,

175
00:09:27.961 --> 00:09:31.500
that's not going to be a concern and I'm going to have a similar ability to

176
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.360
attract audiences. Why wouldn't I go to this other one?

177
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.680
<v 2>Have you booted anyone out of your locals community yet?</v>

178
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.450
<v 0>Not ever had to. I've never had to warn anyone. I mean, having that velvet rope.</v>

179
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:45.350
So how I have it set up is it's free. If you want to watch, read everything,

180
00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:49.040
I have exclusive content. It's five bucks a month. If you want to support me,

181
00:09:49.041 --> 00:09:52.550
and then you could participate in whatever I, we had, not even any arguments.

182
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:57.350
So the fact that I'm so big on people establishing their own boundaries and

183
00:09:57.351 --> 00:10:01.160
being pro joy and not being so sneering, uh,

184
00:10:01.161 --> 00:10:04.730
I think self-selects for a certain qualities of person. Yeah.

185
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.280
<v 2>You find it changes your mood on a day-to-day basis.</v>

186
00:10:07.281 --> 00:10:10.700
Like I opened Twitter and then it's like a half hour later and I'm like, Oh,

187
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.730
what did I just see? It's like, it's like bathing and vomit.

188
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.840
And then I open up my locals and I'm like, Oh, these are all good,

189
00:10:17.841 --> 00:10:20.420
interesting people sharing things about themselves helpless.

190
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:24.470
<v 0>Well, when I go on, that is for many, for my community,</v>

191
00:10:24.471 --> 00:10:27.500
the locals is being used as an alternative Facebook because when people are

192
00:10:27.501 --> 00:10:29.690
posting things about the personalized or someone at work,

193
00:10:29.691 --> 00:10:33.380
they don't have to worry about that from high school casting aspersions on them

194
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.750
or screen capping them. Right. For me, Twitter,

195
00:10:35.751 --> 00:10:37.400
and you and I have different Twitter experiences.

196
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.700
Cause I'm much more of a brawler on Twitter. And I, you know,

197
00:10:40.701 --> 00:10:43.910
monetize the haters, you know, uh, you know, if someone comes at me, I say,

198
00:10:43.911 --> 00:10:45.950
it'd be a shame. If people bought me this book, I don't really want,

199
00:10:45.951 --> 00:10:48.830
just to spite you. And yesterday I just made a hundred bucks, you know,

200
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.660
to buy the antique book.

201
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:54.050
So I think you and I have very different experiences on Twitter and you get a

202
00:10:54.051 --> 00:10:56.390
lot, uh, surprisingly, you get disproportionate more hate than I do.

203
00:10:56.391 --> 00:10:58.640
And I can't figure out why that is. I'm not being sarcastic.

204
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:03.140
<v 2>I walked malice, you know, why come on? They can't let somebody walk.</v>

205
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.640
<v 0>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. Yeah. That's true. You know? Yeah. You're a past state.</v>

206
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.150
You're an apostate. Yeah. Yeah.

207
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.640
<v 2>It's religion, you know, you can't let the nonbelievers walk away.</v>

208
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:17.630
What's next for Michael malice in this situation?

209
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.160
<v 0>My next book is called the white pill. Um, and I'm working on it now.</v>

210
00:11:22.161 --> 00:11:24.170
And this is really going to be a manifest of,

211
00:11:24.171 --> 00:11:27.290
that's going to make people very excited and very hopeful about the future of

212
00:11:27.291 --> 00:11:29.980
this country, because we've beaten some very bad people forward.

213
00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:31.460
People don't realize how bad it used to be.

214
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.450
<v 2>Are you surprised that people don't realize that we will get through to this?</v>

215
00:11:35.451 --> 00:11:37.340
I mean, this is sort of where we started a few minutes ago,

216
00:11:37.341 --> 00:11:41.390
but like that people feel like a certain amount of people just feel like, Oh,

217
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.350
we've crossed some Rubicon. And now it's just endless chaos forever.

218
00:11:45.351 --> 00:11:48.890
Like they sort of don't understand that these things are cyclical and that it

219
00:11:48.891 --> 00:11:50.570
will, we will get better.

220
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:55.900
<v 0>I think it's a very useful technique to tell your opponents preemptively that</v>

221
00:11:55.901 --> 00:11:59.290
you can't win and all hope is lost because then you have to get a scratch in the

222
00:11:59.291 --> 00:11:59.920
battle.

223
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.150
So this is very much been a message coming out from corporate media that it's

224
00:12:04.151 --> 00:12:07.540
over, give it up. You guys can't win. And you know,

225
00:12:07.541 --> 00:12:10.180
we're raised to trust these people raise to believe them.

226
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.720
And some of us will trust them and believe them. And then it's like, Oh wait,

227
00:12:13.721 --> 00:12:16.690
no, they've been lying to me. But everything, since I was a kid,

228
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.900
they're lying about this. They want me to give up. And here's the thing.

229
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:23.470
Even if you lose, at least he could lose you, their head held high.

230
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.940
And to give up for the sake of these people and say,

231
00:12:27.941 --> 00:12:31.300
you can't beat these college professor types that you see these little clips of

232
00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:33.130
them all the time to me is an absurdity.

233
00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:37.290
<v 2>Everyone knows what the red pill is. Malice. What's the white pill.</v>

234
00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:42.000
<v 0>The white pill is the possibility of hope that the good guys will win.</v>

235
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.620
<v 2>That's it? That's all right. Pimp yourself out,</v>

236
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.100
pimp out your locals.

237
00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:55.350
<v 0>It's a malice that locals that come and I, I'm glad to see you all there. Okay.</v>

238
00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:57.480
<v 2>You're a simple man. Michael malice.</v>

239
00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:02.250
I look forward to seeing you next time in full a mermaid outfit.

240
00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:04.410
Keep up the good work. My friend.

241
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.420
<v 0>It'll be a big splash take care of data.</v>

242
