00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.740
<v 0>Exploring the unintended consequences of a safety first culture through the lens</v>

2
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:09.450
of a quarantine was to me a really interesting rumination

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.890
because we can be a safety first country, but only for very, very,

4
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:15.450
very short periods of time.

5
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.000
And then we're reminded that the chief goal of,

6
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:23.370
of living is not to merely stay alive.

7
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.650
<v 2>Before we do anything else.</v>

8
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.510
There's a million things that I want to talk to you about,

9
00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:39.560
but we're in this strange COVID time, obviously. Uh,

10
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:41.570
we're both in California, not in the same town,

11
00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:45.710
but we're both here in California where it does seem like we're going to be one

12
00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:47.030
of the last to open up.

13
00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:51.350
And we've got a lot of kind of big government officials here that seem to be at

14
00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:55.940
least from my position encroaching on our rights at this point. Um, well,

15
00:00:55.941 --> 00:00:59.300
first of all, I guess just, what's your take on the lockdown specifically,

16
00:00:59.301 --> 00:01:01.550
maybe a bit about California since you live here.

17
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.820
And then I want to talk about getting back to work and the importance of working

18
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.923
and things like that.

19
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.510
<v 0>Sure, sure. I, um,</v>

20
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.390
I've been comparing it to the Kubler-Ross five

21
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:17.360
stages of grief, right? I mean,

22
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.030
the country's grieving in a sense,

23
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.890
but we're all at different levels and we're all grieving at different

24
00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:25.850
speeds.

25
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.860
And we're trying to process a lot of information

26
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.300
and a lot of data without a ton of context or perspective.

27
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.990
And so what you wind up getting with that in my view anyway,

28
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.660
is the opportunity to look around and go, Oh, look,

29
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.490
he's in denial and he's bargaining and she's

30
00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:49.460
depressed and she's angry and that one's accepted it,

31
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.830
but what have they accepted exactly?

32
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.930
Have they accepted the reality of the virus,

33
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.700
the reality of the lockdown or this weird space that

34
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:02.090
requires us to somehow navigate both?

35
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.680
And so I early on wrote a piece

36
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.930
called safety third,

37
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.760
which borrowed the title from a special I did for discovery back in 2008,

38
00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:17.960
where I ruminated on the unintended consequences of a culture that truly

39
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.270
elevates safety to an unrealistic place on some hierarchy.

40
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.670
Uh, the safety first culture,

41
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.590
the safety first mentality with regard to vocational work

42
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.360
is, is fascinating because it's rife with unintended consequences. When you,

43
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.270
when you put safety at the top of the thing.

44
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.070
And when you tell your employees or your customers that,

45
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.580
that their safety is your top priority,

46
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.820
you set the table in a very strange way.

47
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.260
And it's a way that oftentimes in my view, anyway, fosters, uh,

48
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.400
complacency among the very customers and employees who should be

49
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.980
really taking a measure of personal responsibility for their own actions.

50
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.470
So exploring the unintended consequences of a safety first culture through the

51
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:12.340
lens of a quarantine was to me a really interesting

52
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.710
rumination because we can be a safety first country, but only for very,

53
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:19.510
very, very short periods of time.

54
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.030
And then we're reminded that the chief goal of,

55
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.200
of living is not to merely stay alive, at least not, not for most people.

56
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.500
And then this fascinating conversation starts to unfold.

57
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.820
So that's a long way of saying that for the last 60 days or so.

58
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.680
I've seen a lot,

59
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.900
a lot of conversation right around a couple of topics that I love

60
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.740
specifically, homeostatic risk, compensatory, risk,

61
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.270
risky equilibrium,

62
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:53.950
and all of the subconscious things we do to maintain our own, uh,

63
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.400
illusory relationship with the illusion of safety.

64
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.200
<v 2>So let's talk about those types of risk a little bit,</v>

65
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.460
because you've worked with a ton of people who take all sorts of crazy risks in

66
00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:07.500
their day-to-day jobs all the time.

67
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.750
Do you sense that maybe we've hit the limit as we enter sort of

68
00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:17.160
now two months or roughly eight weeks of lockdown that we've sort of hit the

69
00:04:17.161 --> 00:04:20.730
limit where now it's like, okay, we did what we had to do,

70
00:04:20.731 --> 00:04:24.240
but what I'm sensing at least here in LA where, you know, it's pretty lefty.

71
00:04:24.241 --> 00:04:27.030
People are willing to accept, you know, a lot of government,

72
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.410
but now when I'm walking my dog, my, my neighbors, you know,

73
00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:36.330
they're suddenly going, we gotta be outside now. Like it's 85 and sunny,

74
00:04:36.331 --> 00:04:40.110
why am I not at the beach right now that that's something I'm not even talking

75
00:04:40.111 --> 00:04:40.231
about.

76
00:04:40.231 --> 00:04:43.500
The people that have had their lives destroyed and lost jobs and every does,

77
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.370
I'm talking just sort of the regular people who walk around in a sort of days

78
00:04:47.371 --> 00:04:52.290
about what reality is all the time, but even they're starting to tilt now. Um,

79
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540
are,

80
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.290
are you sort of amazed at the way we don't look at risk normally until suddenly

81
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.620
it smacks us in the face?

82
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.480
<v 0>Well, yes, because look, we're just not used to it yet.</v>

83
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.250
And part of the reason we're not used to it is because it's just a staggering,

84
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.710
new thing to get your head around.

85
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.660
But it's also hard to get used to a thing when the goalposts are constantly

86
00:05:15.661 --> 00:05:19.710
moved when the data is constantly shifting. And most of all,

87
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.180
when the experts themselves are in violent disagreement,

88
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.950
this is the most disconcerting thing to people. And,

89
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.620
and I'm sure you've spoken about it is one of the,

90
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.580
in that same article that I wrote early on was this idea that, I mean,

91
00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:38.880
here's Neil Ferguson, right? He's very,

92
00:05:38.881 --> 00:05:42.110
very clear in his projections and his modeling and,

93
00:05:42.111 --> 00:05:45.480
and here's John I and ed sat down at Stanford and he's saying, look,

94
00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:49.950
I just don't, um, I'm looking at the same data. I'm not disputing the data,

95
00:05:49.951 --> 00:05:53.730
but I just don't think it's reliable. And these two big brain guys, you know,

96
00:05:53.731 --> 00:05:58.550
one's predicting 80,000 fatalities in this country, others 2.2 million,

97
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.650
somebody is not just wrong. Somebody is very, very, very, very wrong.

98
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.350
And so, you know, when,

99
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.360
when you look at that through the lens of a fake

100
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:15.500
news culture where the sources are inherently

101
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:18.860
unreliable and where everything is politicized, you know,

102
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.360
it's not unreasonable for the average American to look around

103
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.170
and be skeptical, you know, and it's,

104
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:31.580
and it's not unpatriotic to want to look at this thing from all sides and kick

105
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:36.470
the tires and to your question, we're creatures of, uh,

106
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.690
visual stimulation. You know,

107
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:42.560
we take our cues from a thousand different things that happen around us all of

108
00:06:42.561 --> 00:06:46.460
the time. And you're right when the sun goes out and the breeze is warm and,

109
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.850
and it's like, this is when we're supposed to be doing X, Y, and Z,

110
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.250
but we can't. And we don't because time is somehow bent.

111
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.810
And I don't know, but I mean, it's, it's, it's been hard for me personally,

112
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.140
to concentrate. I thought when this happened,

113
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.450
I was going to sit down and take a few months and write, I love to write,

114
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.530
I write mostly on planes. Now, finally, I have a chance to do this.

115
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.660
I can't, it's all I can do to get my podcast up once a week now.

116
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.973
And, um,

117
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.510
and part of the reason is because I'm genuinely curious to

118
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.460
stay informed or at least try to make sense of the next

119
00:07:28.461 --> 00:07:33.290
deal. It's like somebody dealing the cards, Dave, and they just don't stop.

120
00:07:33.291 --> 00:07:37.520
They just keep coming and you think you're playing one game and now you're in a

121
00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:40.970
completely different game. It's back to the stages of grief.

122
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.800
Everybody is always starting over and trying to figure out where they are and,

123
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.430
uh, what 330 million people are doing that contemporaneously.

124
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:50.773
It's a hell of a thing.

125
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:51.701
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

126
00:07:51.701 --> 00:07:55.750
I love that analogy because it's not only as if they're playing with unlimited

127
00:07:55.751 --> 00:07:56.081
cards,

128
00:07:56.081 --> 00:08:00.250
but it's also that you don't know whether you're playing poker or some other

129
00:08:00.251 --> 00:08:02.860
game, or they're going to flip it in the middle or something else.

130
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.990
Like we're just sort of stuck in this endless thing.

131
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:07.720
So then how does a guy like you, who has a pre ice,

132
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.290
I assume you consider yourself someone with a pretty high risk threshold.

133
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:12.423
I mean,

134
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:17.440
how do you decide when you have to now start taking risks and going out either

135
00:08:17.441 --> 00:08:18.790
with, or without a mask, or just,

136
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.210
just not listening to whatever that as you described,

137
00:08:22.211 --> 00:08:24.160
we have this fake news thing out there when,

138
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.410
when you're not going to listen to the narrative anymore.

139
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.310
<v 0>Well, this is the it's, it's, it's the eternal paradox,</v>

140
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:34.240
because the honest answer in normal times to your question is,

141
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:37.930
is deeply personal risk is personal, right?

142
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.220
This is why risk compensation, uh, is so interesting.

143
00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:44.380
You have a hundred people in a room.

144
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:49.210
Everybody has a slightly different tolerance for risk. And when you enter the,

145
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:53.500
when you introduce protocols, safety features, for instance, um,

146
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:59.010
the theory that your behavior will change to suit

147
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.520
the measures you take. For instance,

148
00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.590
if you wear a seatbelt studies show, you drive faster.

149
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.810
If you wear a helmet on your motorcycle studies show you corner faster,

150
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.320
the more safety features you put on a machine,

151
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.360
the more likely the operator is to assume a level of risk

152
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.840
that is slightly heightened. Why? Because there's a,

153
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:30.270
there's a thing in our brain that wants to keep the risk homeo

154
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.470
in a, in a, in a homeostatic state, right?

155
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.150
So Reese risk equilibrium is the thing that says you subconsciously

156
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:43.380
adjust your behavior to adapt to your circumstances was perfectly rational.

157
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.310
But as you start to introduce new safety protocols,

158
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:49.800
subconscious things start to happen.

159
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.300
Why for instance are the most dangerous intersections in the world.

160
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.380
The ones that have the crosswalks and the little guy telling you when the walk

161
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:03.690
in part it's, because it trains us to look at the little guy walking.

162
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.100
And when we see him walking,

163
00:10:05.101 --> 00:10:09.270
we step off the curb and then the big blue bus takes us out, right?

164
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.180
Because we've been trained not to look. So
