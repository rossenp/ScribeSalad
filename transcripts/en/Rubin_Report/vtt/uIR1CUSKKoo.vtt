00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.230
<v 0>When you go for gender equity, what you want is, well, you want the facade,</v>

2
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:08.850
right? You want 50, 50%, 50% here. And 50% there,

3
00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:11.040
men and women, it doesn't matter if they're competent,

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:12.660
if they want to work there.

5
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.100
And we have government bodies regulating this and trying to, uh,

6
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.650
and we do this from kindergarten and upwards.

7
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.040
Can you talk about how this is related to sort of how men are treated or at

8
00:00:28.041 --> 00:00:31.460
least talked about in Sweden because you guys have the first supposedly

9
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.880
self-proclaimed feminist government, right? Yes. Even though they are,

10
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.420
as you could tell, when they visited Iran, they all Wars niqab.

11
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.960
So very feminist indeed. Yeah. You're very fast. Um, but,

12
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.800
but the reason I mentioned that is because, uh, I, I, as I said earlier,

13
00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:46.970
I did both of your podcasts,

14
00:00:46.971 --> 00:00:50.480
which we'll link to below because I want people to see you guys as hosts.

15
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.930
But I mentioned the story to both of you, uh,

16
00:00:52.931 --> 00:00:56.000
of how the day of the Stockholm shows it was cold out.

17
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.390
And I wanted to get a hat. And I went into H and M, which is your,

18
00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:04.090
is that your greatest? Well, H and M gap here are your greatest exports. Um,

19
00:01:04.091 --> 00:01:08.540
and I went into H and M and I was online to buy the hat and the guy in front of

20
00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:12.260
me, young guy, probably 20, 21 years old says to the cashier, uh,

21
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.080
this is the first suit I've ever bought. Uh, he was speaking in English,

22
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.510
the first suit I've ever bought. And, uh,

23
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.490
and I'm going to see this Jordan Peterson show tonight.

24
00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:22.280
And then the cashier says, I'm going to see the Jordan beaters and Joe tonight.

25
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.260
So I tapped the guy on the shoulder. I turned around. I said,

26
00:01:24.261 --> 00:01:26.510
I'm going to see the Jordan beaters that Joe. And he knew who I was.

27
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.170
And I just thought it was such an incredible moment like this young kid who

28
00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:33.740
literally was buying the first suit of his life to, as you just said,

29
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.550
listen to a Canadian psychology professor,

30
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.510
tell him to sit up straight with his shoulders back.

31
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.510
So can you talk a little bit about what's happening with either young people or

32
00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:43.580
men or both, or some combination?

33
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.220
There's a problem with language because what I think they're trying to do in

34
00:01:49.221 --> 00:01:53.240
Sweden have been trying for my entire life is they're trying to accomplish

35
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.590
gender equity.

36
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.240
And that's not the same thing as a quality of the sexes, right?

37
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.440
Have equality of the sexes in many senses, right?

38
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.420
It depends on what you mean with quality men and women have the same

39
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:10.280
opportunities. In some cases,

40
00:02:10.281 --> 00:02:13.850
women even have more opportunities economically when it comes to subsidies for

41
00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:17.180
being pregnant, for instance, or taking maternity leave.

42
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.800
The free choices that women make are though considered a problem. Because,

43
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.440
so this is the, this is the interesting way, but just to be clear though,

44
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.340
because what part of what I said, no, no, no. When, when you, uh,

45
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.570
when you go for gender equity, what you want is, well, you want the facade,

46
00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:37.160
right? Do you want 50, 50%, 50% here? And 50% there,

47
00:02:37.161 --> 00:02:39.350
men and women, it doesn't matter if they're competent,

48
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.970
if they want to work there.

49
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.440
And we have government bodies regulating this and trying to, uh,

50
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.160
and we do this from kindergarten and upwards, we, we, uh,

51
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.480
encourage the girls to take up more space and be less like girls.

52
00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:55.730
And we encourage the boys to, you know,

53
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.470
close inwards and not take up as much pit space too.

54
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.880
So basically what they're trying to do is they're trying to make these kids go

55
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:08.590
against, uh, their biology or whatever they feel is right,

56
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.370
because they want it to look perfect. So to be clear,

57
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:17.080
it's not just equal justice, right? It's not just, um, you know,

58
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:21.580
you should act this way, but it ends up working into how, what jobs they choose.

59
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:24.340
Because, uh, Jordan mentioned this several times there,

60
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.600
and a lot of people talk about this, that you,

61
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:28.600
because you guys have had a quality for so long,

62
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:30.940
meaning you could do whatever you want as a man or a woman.

63
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.490
It turned out that yes,

64
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.270
women tend to be nurses more than men turn out to be engineers.

65
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:39.490
More because women generally are more interested in people.

66
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.650
And men happened to be more interested in things.

67
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:43.300
That's just the nature of reality,

68
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.540
but gender is what you were getting to the social justice warriors.

69
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:49.270
Don't like that experiment. They don't like the experiment.

70
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.330
<v 1>Freedom. Jordan was on a talk show host in Sweden on a talk show in Sweden,</v>

71
00:03:54.331 --> 00:03:59.280
where he was addressing this very topic. And basically he said, well, you know,

72
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.740
science supports that this is the way it happens in a free country where people

73
00:04:04.741 --> 00:04:08.700
can choose. And we had like one of the top level politicians there and she was,

74
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.620
well, I don't agree with that. And you know, I was just flat. I actually made a,

75
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.420
you know, an episode on my show about that,

76
00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:19.290
because like this mind just society science says this, I don't agree with it.

77
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.850
Okay. So what, what are, you know, missing?

78
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.860
<v 0>Yeah. But, but, so that thing though, so the,</v>

79
00:04:25.861 --> 00:04:27.720
the politician says that I don't agree with it.

80
00:04:27.721 --> 00:04:30.300
I don't agree with what science says. I don't agree with what biology says.

81
00:04:30.301 --> 00:04:31.800
We all know that men or women are different.

82
00:04:31.801 --> 00:04:36.120
It doesn't make either sex better than the other. It just, it's just an is. Uh,

83
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.350
but when you hear that response,

84
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.450
you think most people just swallow that and take it.

85
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.540
<v 1>I think most people do that because we're a fiercely egalitarian,</v>

86
00:04:42.541 --> 00:04:43.950
very conformist people.

87
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.390
So they have been drained for very long to just accept that form of

88
00:04:48.391 --> 00:04:52.590
communication. Now we have, uh, you know, a government body,

89
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.890
the ministry of equality. And I mean,

90
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.430
just the name sounds like so totally Terry and I can't, you know,

91
00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:01.380
it's like totally.

92
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.450
And they have the authority to look at like all companies and other

93
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.560
governmental bodies.

94
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.060
<v 0>[Inaudible] schools, universities, everything,</v>

95
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.610
everything has to be gender mainstream.

96
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.480
<v 1>Run by women, the only women working at the so.</v>

97
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.810
<v 0>W right. So when you do this, then as a private businessman, how,</v>

98
00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:22.830
how does that affect you?

99
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.170
<v 1>You know, funny thing is like, when I,</v>

100
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.670
when my YouTube channel started taking off my business partner, he was like,

101
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.290
okay, what's happening. What's going on?

102
00:05:31.291 --> 00:05:35.970
This might actually hurt our business interests. Uh, and I said, well, you know,

103
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.550
if we start seeing some, some, you know,

104
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.340
disasters happening because of what I'm saying online,

105
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.550
we'll have a conversation and say, okay, so we, we tried it for awhile.

106
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.230
Turns out business is booming because now people are there, you know,

107
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.460
finding me just because they see my videos. So I want to work for your company.

108
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.340
So even though we have all these enemies, now,

109
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.220
those are people wouldn't want to work with anyway.

110
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.260
<v 0>Right. But what about on the hiring side though? I mean,</v>

111
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:04.310
when you're actually hiring people, you have to look at that,

112
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.860
those immutable characteristics to figure out who you're going to hire.

113
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.180
<v 1>Well, I don't handle the recruiting anymore personally.</v>

114
00:06:10.181 --> 00:06:14.080
So I've kind of removed myself my face from that a bit. Um,

115
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.860
I don't think it's much of a problem because Sweden has a general problem.

116
00:06:17.861 --> 00:06:20.620
When it comes to recruiting talented people, we don't have enough of them.

117
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.890
We have a lot of people that are going, you know,

118
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.670
subsidies and various government programs, loads, but I mean, it recruiting,

119
00:06:27.671 --> 00:06:29.650
you know, very smart it professionals. That's,

120
00:06:29.651 --> 00:06:31.450
that's generally a very difficult,

121
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.650
although I find I have quite a few of them, you know,

122
00:06:35.651 --> 00:06:38.950
these software guys that are quite libertarian,

123
00:06:38.951 --> 00:06:43.000
so no, I don't see it. That's a great problem. The, you know, the,

124
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.420
here's another thing I'd like to mention.

125
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.130
You're not allowed to ask people anything you want when you hire them in Sweden.

126
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.760
So when I first started out with my company, I would ask people to,

127
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.570
are you in any unions began? I don't want any unionized people in my companies.

128
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.130
And then my HR, eventually you got to stop saying that Henrik it's illegal.

129
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.020
You cannot ask them if they're unionized. Um, so now we, we have a text.

130
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.060
And when we recruit, which is kind of like,

131
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.270
are you a very clear collectivistic minded person?

132
00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:15.640
This might not be the place for you. Yeah.

133
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.280
<v 0>Jeez. I mean, this is happening everywhere now.</v>

134
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:23.170
So I think it does hurt kids because if you raise an entire

135
00:07:23.171 --> 00:07:27.340
generations of girls telling them that they are beautiful and we can strong at

136
00:07:27.341 --> 00:07:31.210
the same time and can do no wrong while you're turning them into sexist

137
00:07:31.211 --> 00:07:32.290
fascists, basically.

138
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.670
And you're telling all the boys that they are inherently evil that's and we've

139
00:07:36.671 --> 00:07:38.620
been doing this for a long time now.

140
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.230
So is that the part that's particularly perverse about this?

141
00:07:41.231 --> 00:07:43.780
So you take a society, you make them equal then at the same time,

142
00:07:43.781 --> 00:07:47.080
because you know that humans are going to have individual emotions. You keep,

143
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.410
you keep telling the males that they're evil,

144
00:07:50.411 --> 00:07:55.180
despite the fact that you in Sweden have done more for equality than virtually

145
00:07:55.181 --> 00:07:57.250
anybody. So it's, it's really like,

146
00:07:57.251 --> 00:07:59.860
it's just never enough because actually as you guys know what they,

147
00:07:59.861 --> 00:08:04.630
don't what they want. It's not really a quality it's no, no, yes. Convert. Yeah.

148
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.160
And I've been trying to tell them that this would be as if someone came out as

149
00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:12.190
gay and you told them no, suppress that. Right.

150
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.130
Because that's what you're telling the boys like, Oh,

151
00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:18.790
you feel the need to run around and play football, suppress it.

152
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:23.200
And in telling the girls like you're playing with dolls, bad girl,

153
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:27.220
go out and play football. Now, before the haters get in here and say, Oh,

154
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.560
Aaron flam doesn't want boys to play with Barbies.

155
00:08:29.561 --> 00:08:34.000
You actually are perfectly okay. I never played football. I was not the type.

156
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.620
You have a huge Barbie collection, which for a man of your age is a bit much.

157
00:08:38.621 --> 00:08:42.790
Now I was into He-Man and star Wars, figurines,

158
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:47.890
or action figures. Yes. You call them that to make them sound more manly,

159
00:08:47.891 --> 00:08:51.520
but they're basically dolls. I'll show you my collection when we're out here.

160
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.910
Um, all right. Let's shift a little bit, because you mentioned actually that,

161
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:00.390
uh, lived in, I believe you're moving. If I can say that, um,

162
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:05.100
in Malmo now we hear a lot about Malmo on a certain side of the internet, uh,

163
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:09.240
where they report on a lot of bombings and stabbings and all these weird things

164
00:09:09.241 --> 00:09:13.140
coming out of Malmo. Now we only hear of this from sort of right.

165
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.980
What I would say, not just center, right, but more right. Leaning things,

166
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.270
outlets in America.

167
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.410
And then anyone that reports on them says that they're racist and they're

168
00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:27.180
bigoted and the rest of it. You live in mellow. What, what happened in Malmo?

169
00:09:27.181 --> 00:09:29.580
And just tell me a little bit about the history of Malmo before anything else.

170
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:35.690
<v 1>Mamo it's in the deep South of Sweden. Um, uh, so it's a port city. Uh,</v>

171
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.140
this is where basically everyone that's coming to Sweden, you know,

172
00:09:39.141 --> 00:09:40.400
by foot or by car,

173
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.340
that they will enter across a bridge and they come into Malmo.

174
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.850
So we have a very large, uh, number of, you know,

175
00:09:46.851 --> 00:09:51.800
refugees and so forth from the crisis of 2015. And Malmo is,

176
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.010
is always been a rather poor city. And I used it. They used to big,

177
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.900
big ships there. And in the 1980s,

178
00:09:56.901 --> 00:09:59.480
that old collapsed and everyone was an alcoholic for a while,

179
00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.000
then it kind of came slightly better, but it's,

180
00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.540
it's a loss-making city and it's,

181
00:10:04.541 --> 00:10:08.570
it's been brung by socialist for better part of the last hundred years.

182
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.050
Now over time,

183
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:16.100
crime in MoMA started to rise uncontrolled.

184
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:19.280
