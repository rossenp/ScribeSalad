00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.540
<v 0>Y P you know, millennials and gen Z ears are, are re,</v>

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.370
are reconnecting with the church or connecting for the first time to faith. Uh,

3
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:12.990
I think large in part due to the failure, you know,

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.910
perhaps of, of, of, of secularism it doesn't work.

5
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.150
Um, and there's questions. I think that, that it's attempted to answer it,

6
00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:24.390
that it hasn't answered.

7
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.430
And that's why you leave and see guys like Sam Harris who have become spiritual,

8
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:31.170
not in any sort of Orthodox sense,

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.430
but an awareness that maybe there is something out there that aren't,

10
00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:36.780
we connect to and soul and spirit, et cetera.

11
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.860
<v 2>I'm Dave Rubin. And this is the Rubin report. Quick reminder,</v>

12
00:00:48.861 --> 00:00:53.330
everybody to subscribe to our YouTube channel and click that pesky notification

13
00:00:53.331 --> 00:00:57.700
bell. And joining me today is an author and a teaching pastor. Nathan.

14
00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.330
Pinoccio welcome to the Rubin report.

15
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.510
I'm glad to have you, sir, because as you probably know,

16
00:01:05.511 --> 00:01:09.880
I do some talking to people of faith, people, uh, uh,

17
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.950
better skeptics people that are somewhere in between.

18
00:01:12.951 --> 00:01:16.670
And I always find these to be sort of the most interesting conversations that I

19
00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:20.090
have. So before we do anything about what you're doing now,

20
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.240
tell me a little bit about your journey to faith.

21
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.750
<v 0>Yeah. So, uh, I'm the son of a preacher man.</v>

22
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:31.370
My dad has been in the ministry as long as I could remember. Um,

23
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.060
and I've sort of just fallen into it to be quite honest. I,

24
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:38.810
I tried to kind of not necessarily run the other way,

25
00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:42.950
but do something else and sort of just caught up to me, you know, it's like,

26
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.700
you know, so it just kind of, uh, this is what I do now.

27
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.570
Cause it's just kind of what I, what I know, but I do. Um,

28
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.860
I do have, I've always had a kind of strong faith in God.

29
00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:58.250
I just never saw myself as the ministerial type because you know,

30
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.780
like people of faith, I guess, spiritual leaders,

31
00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:06.230
they kind of have a type. And in my opinion, they're, they're my opinion.

32
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.090
They're, they're kind of square and they stay home on Friday nights and play

33
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.540
Scrabble with grandma. And it was just not what I wanted to do with my life.

34
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.403
You know?

35
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.260
<v 2>Hey, don't knock Scrabble, man. Everybody loves Scrabble.</v>

36
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.090
<v 0>Look, I take that back. Okay. Scrapple is crate and grandma's wonderful.</v>

37
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.100
<v 2>Uh, well, to your point though, you kinda it's like, well, wait a minute,</v>

38
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:30.410
look at this guy. He doesn't really look like a pastor.

39
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:33.620
And then on the other hand, you look like sort of a modern Jesus. So you're,

40
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.510
you're sort of doing a little everything over there.

41
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.930
<v 0>Um, uh, it's, you know, it's a work in progress.</v>

42
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.560
<v 2>Um, did you, on the way, you said you did a little something, uh,</v>

43
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.190
before going into this, even though you came from a family of faith, uh,

44
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.440
was the faith part always there,

45
00:02:51.441 --> 00:02:53.450
or did you mean that you deviated from that too?

46
00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:55.880
Or did you just mean that sort of career-wise or something?

47
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.100
<v 0>I just meant that sort of career wise? Yeah, I was doing music, um,</v>

48
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.940
for about eight years. And, um, so yeah,

49
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:07.990
it's kind of doing that and things just didn't work out the way I kind of wanted

50
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:10.930
them to work out. I sort of went back to, uh,

51
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.050
went back to the family farm, so to speak.

52
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.580
And so I'm just kind of doing ministry now for the last gosh, I don't know,

53
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.320
uh, last six years.

54
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.640
<v 2>So if somebody said to you sort of lay out what your belief system</v>

55
00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:29.640
is, what would that be? Kind of broadly speaking.

56
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.860
<v 0>Yeah. So I'm a, I'm a confessional Christian. Um, that's what I'd say.</v>

57
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.170
Um, uh, in the, uh, kind of the brand of Christianity that,

58
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.180
um, or the stream that I flow in, it's more of a Pentecostal Christianity,

59
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.050
you know? So we're the ones that, um, I mean, I've never handled a snake before,

60
00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:52.260
but that's kind of what Pentecostals are known for, you know,

61
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.200
Tamborine destroying Pentecostals were the ones that when you

62
00:03:58.201 --> 00:04:02.970
go to our churches on the weekend, um, it's kind of like a rock concert. Um,

63
00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:07.740
so we've got lasers and, you know, we, we kind of attract a younger crowd. Uh,

64
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.710
but our idea basically is that we have a,

65
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.750
a historic Orthodox confessional, um,

66
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.100
Christian doctrine.

67
00:04:17.101 --> 00:04:21.280
So we believe that the stuff that the church has always believed, um,

68
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:25.530
and we confess and we profess that. Uh, but the, we wrap it up,

69
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.390
um, in sort of a modern, um, in a modern vibe.

70
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.860
<v 2>Yeah. Do you get a lot of pushback on that? Sort of,</v>

71
00:04:34.861 --> 00:04:38.040
I've seen this in a few different versions where there's, you know,

72
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.950
the sort of belief that you just have to have the belief and the,

73
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.340
the orthodoxy and the conservative look at religion,

74
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.220
and then you bring in music, you bring in lasers,

75
00:04:47.221 --> 00:04:50.190
you bring in bands and all sorts of other stuff. And people,

76
00:04:50.191 --> 00:04:53.940
a certain set of people will think that that will kind of erode the original

77
00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:54.774
message.

78
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.840
<v 0>Yeah. Um, yeah,</v>

79
00:04:57.841 --> 00:05:02.220
I think that that's utter and total ridiculousness, um,

80
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.540
basically, I mean,

81
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.170
look at Vatican three and kind of what the Catholic church has done,

82
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.180
like is having services in English somehow diminish

83
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.900
the Catholic churches, you know, their their message. No, it doesn't.

84
00:05:15.901 --> 00:05:18.720
So that's essentially what we're doing, where,

85
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.180
whereas they're just there for them.

86
00:05:21.181 --> 00:05:26.070
Progress is translating the mass from Latin to English for us. We're,

87
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.970
we're doing exactly that. We're translating the message, but like, you know,

88
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.680
the currency, I think of our generation is music and the arts.

89
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.340
And so that's kind of how we, uh, we communicated that language.

90
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.430
<v 2>Right? So sort of speaking of music and the arts,</v>

91
00:05:41.431 --> 00:05:44.250
what kind of put you on my radar is that, uh,

92
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.940
Justin Bieber is a member of the church. I don't want you to get into any,

93
00:05:47.941 --> 00:05:51.270
any specifics about anyone that goes to the church, but,

94
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.830
but what do you sense is happening with people of his

95
00:05:55.831 --> 00:06:00.470
age related to belief? There does seem to be something going on, you know,

96
00:06:00.471 --> 00:06:04.550
Kanye is running these services now and, you know, as you just said,

97
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:07.490
it's sort of related to music and culture and something else.

98
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.940
It's not what we think of when we just think of like the traditional religious

99
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:11.500
perspective.

100
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.310
<v 0>Yeah, yeah. A hundred percent. I think that people,</v>

101
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.940
I know you mentioned Justin and Kanye. Um, as far as I know,

102
00:06:18.941 --> 00:06:21.220
they had church upbringings. Um,

103
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.480
so there's a lot of people come up in the church. Um,

104
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.720
I know Justin for a fact did, um, I went to,

105
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.030
I spoke at his home church in Canada.

106
00:06:31.031 --> 00:06:34.510
I'm actually Canadian I've I grew up 45 minutes from where he grew up.

107
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.450
Um, so I know like, I mean, Elvis for crying out loud,

108
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.120
you know, came up in the churches.

109
00:06:42.121 --> 00:06:46.240
It's not uncommon in the American story that people in the arts come up in

110
00:06:46.241 --> 00:06:49.870
church and then they kind of leave the small town and they go do big musical

111
00:06:49.871 --> 00:06:54.280
things. So, um, but in terms of a return, I mean,

112
00:06:54.281 --> 00:06:56.560
we saw it even in Elvis's career, you know,

113
00:06:56.561 --> 00:07:01.030
the only album that ever won a Grammy for, uh, was for his gospel record.

114
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.950
So there's something I think, intrinsic to, um, Americana

115
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.890
and the church and music. Um, so it's a pretty common, common theme.

116
00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.550
Why, you know, millennials and gen Z years are, are re,

117
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.380
are reconnecting with the church or connecting for the first time to faith. Uh,

118
00:07:20.381 --> 00:07:25.000
I think large in part due to the failure, you know,

119
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.920
perhaps of, of, of secularism it, it doesn't work.

120
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.890
Um, and there's questions. I think that,

121
00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.400
that it's attempted to answer that it hasn't answered.

122
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.440
And that's why you leave and see guys like Sam Harris who have become spiritual,

123
00:07:41.441 --> 00:07:43.180
not in any sort of Orthodox sense,

124
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.420
but an awareness that maybe there is something out there that aren't,

125
00:07:46.421 --> 00:07:50.080
we connect to and soul and spirit, et cetera. Um,

126
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:54.520
so I think we have something to offer people, um, that is,

127
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.750
that is reasonable. Um, um,

128
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.320
and that is also experiential. So.

129
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:05.230
<v 2>One of the things that I've been talking about on the show a lot lately is that</v>

130
00:08:05.231 --> 00:08:08.740
I think a lot of the problems we're having is that we seem to be reaching the

131
00:08:08.741 --> 00:08:10.030
end of secularism,

132
00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:13.840
which I think is sort of what you're alluding to that when you get to the end of

133
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:17.950
pure secularism with nothing else outside of itself,

134
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.230
that everything's on the table again.

135
00:08:20.231 --> 00:08:23.410
And we don't know if men are men and women are women and we're debating

136
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.790
destroying, you know,

137
00:08:24.791 --> 00:08:28.660
our past in the name of some utopian future and the rest of it.

138
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:33.040
Do you see that as just like the natural kind of outgrowth of what, uh,

139
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.320
what a purely secular society is?

140
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:42.280
<v 0>Yeah, I think, um, gosh, you know, without getting into a huge history lesson,</v>

141
00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.570
um, w what I would call, I think there's two types of,

142
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.720
of there's two types of people in our churches right now. Okay.

143
00:08:49.721 --> 00:08:54.070
There's what we would make, might call leftists, um,

144
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:59.040
and a secular be a secularist might be a better term. Um, but,

145
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.120
and then we have, you know, for lack of a better term, a conservative,

146
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.590
which I can't stand the term, but, um, but just using generalizations.

147
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:11.970
And what I think has happened as a society is that we have an epistemological

148
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:15.120
crisis. That's kind of what happened with what has happened,

149
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:16.830
because secularism is the idea, essentially,

150
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:21.180
that material is the only thing that you can touch. And we could all,

151
00:09:21.181 --> 00:09:24.750
we should all live together in our material society. Um,

152
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.980
and let's forget about things that are not, are, non-material like spirituality,

153
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.820
because those things will just divide us. And it was kind of,

154
00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.760
it kind of works out at first, but then, um,

155
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:39.690
it begins to hammer down everybody into just material and people aren't just

156
00:09:39.691 --> 00:09:43.260
material and the world. Isn't just material. There's a lot more to it.

157
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.330

nonstop yelling, check out our spirituality playlist.
