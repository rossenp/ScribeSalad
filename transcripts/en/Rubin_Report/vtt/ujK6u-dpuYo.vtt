1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.030
<v 0>You make a mistake and it's brought up against you 30 years later to keep you</v>

2
00:00:03.031 --> 00:00:06.390
out of public office when you might've grown enormously as a human being.

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.330
I think we need to see civility actually as a tough minded virtue

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.060
that says picking up on the old, um, Evelyn Beatrice, whole idea,

5
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.930
uh, that I may disagree with you, but I'll defend to the death,

6
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:27.210
your right to say it implies two things.

7
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.810
I'll respect you enough to say you have a right to put your ideas on the table

8
00:00:30.811 --> 00:00:32.610
and then the ideas or the issue,

9
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:34.590
because that's where we'll get the best way forward.

10
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.090
It's not for me to demonize you. I don't like your ideas, but absolutely.

11
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.940
You've got the right to put them on the table. Let's throw those out.

12
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.440
Now it's an equal playing ground because that's not the way the games being

13
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.520
played, but I don't see any option. And even people like Gandy sort of,

14
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.530
kind of got that. Didn't he? I mean,

15
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.170
it's about forgiveness at something's washing out of our culture and you know,

16
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.540
I don't know how relationships ever work if we can't forgive.

17
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.380
And I think we have to be prepared to practice that and say, look, it's okay,

18
00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:06.990
I'm sorry I was offended, but that doesn't matter. Let's move on.

19
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.860
Rather than this perpetual, I will carry the offense to the grave.

20
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.580
And that's the other great problem we've got in our culture because we, even,

21
00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:15.990
if you can try and forgive, now,

22
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:19.710
you can't forget because social media is stored up. Absolutely everything.

23
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.750
<v 1>So that's also the interesting part is that the asymmetry of the rules I think</v>

24
00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:26.750
is what's becoming harder and harder for conservatives. So for example,

25
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:28.610
Justin Trudeau can show up in blackface.

26
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.240
I don't think most people think he's a true racist by any stretch.

27
00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:35.630
He did something stupid. It was, you know, times change all of those things.

28
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.350
You know, we've had the governor here, Ralph Northam also, you know,

29
00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:41.630
blackface 30 years ago, but he's a Democrat.

30
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.710
And the point is that they're both still in power while we know if these were

31
00:01:45.711 --> 00:01:49.400
conservatives or Republicans or whatever, they would be destroyed. And then,

32
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.890
so then because of that, well, because of that,

33
00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:55.880
then we see the conservatives going, no, we have to destroy them too.

34
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.130
And that's, I think that's the impulse that you're saying, no,

35
00:01:58.131 --> 00:01:59.600
we have to fight that impulse. Yeah.

36
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.720
<v 0>I, I believe that's right. I mean, I think there, the, uh,</v>

37
00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:07.490
the point would be to go to the frankly, the hypocrisy of it and highlight that,

38
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.550
but they're trying to avoid doing, you know,

39
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.560
the triumphalism remember the lessons when we stop burning one another at the

40
00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:19.250
stake at the heart of this unique model of Western harmony,

41
00:02:19.251 --> 00:02:23.210
where we learnt to live with one another's deepest differences was a willingness

42
00:02:23.211 --> 00:02:27.530
to respect another person's conscience and let them live truly to that Constance

43
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.130
as long as they are not damaging other people.

44
00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:33.530
And I don't mean by that occasionally offending people,

45
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:36.710
this idea that you can't give a fence. And that is that,

46
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.120
that is a way to shut down debate if ever there was. And,

47
00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:42.260
you know, um,

48
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.770
if I'm honest about my life at times in which I've grown up in the times when

49
00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:46.910
I've been grossly offended,

50
00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:48.740
because somebody else has told me something about me,

51
00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:52.910
I haven't wanted to hear and I've had to grow out of it, you know, um, that, um,

52
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.030
Jonathan height makes that point. You know, we tell our kids,

53
00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:59.150
we bring them up to believe, um, that, um,

54
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.410
uh, what doesn't kill you will make you weaker. He says,

55
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.370
actually we need to build resilience. And when we get the setbacks,

56
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:13.660
we've got to learn from them and not just be like a plastic cup that you drop on

57
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:15.430
the floor and recovers its shape.

58
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.940
We actually need to be people when we've had a setback who grow,

59
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.890
he calls it anti-fragility and our parents and grandparents believed that.

60
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:26.620
And look at what the great generation as you call them in this country went

61
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:26.880
through.

62
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.230
<v 1>So is that just all then a function of our success that our parent you're right.</v>

63
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.660
Our parents, our grandparents went through it, grandparents,

64
00:03:33.661 --> 00:03:37.440
particularly at least in an American context. And because of that,

65
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.920
because of that grit and fight that,

66
00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:43.860
then they sort of got us to unprecedented wealth,

67
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.650
a growing middle-class in the United States. And what happened? Well,

68
00:03:46.651 --> 00:03:47.850
we got participation trophy.

69
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.880
<v 0>Yeah. I think you might be right. And maybe it took, I mean,</v>

70
00:03:50.881 --> 00:03:55.120
I grew up with a father who had a horrendous second world war, uh, and, uh,

71
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:57.460
I was born quite late in his life. Uh,

72
00:03:57.461 --> 00:04:01.020
and so I always lived with a man had seen war he'd volunteered, hated it,

73
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:02.640
you know, could never talk of,

74
00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:06.750
it was almost killed in the campaign against Rommel, um,

75
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.900
in the Western desert and that's shaped me.

76
00:04:09.901 --> 00:04:14.850
But then I'm conscious that I had a desire with my four

77
00:04:14.851 --> 00:04:18.510
children to want to snowplow for them. There was a tendency was there.

78
00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:21.570
I wanted to remove every obstacle in a way that my father didn't try for me.

79
00:04:21.571 --> 00:04:26.100
He knew instinctively that a few challenges were a good thing for me.

80
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.150
And I knew that too,

81
00:04:27.151 --> 00:04:30.240
but I had to pull myself back cause the instinct all the time was to make it

82
00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:34.890
soft and easy. And I think Jonathan Heights, right, it doesn't work.

83
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.570
And he goes on to say that we then encourage children to trust their feelings.

84
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.790
Your feelings are always right. We know that's not right.

85
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.600
You have to think things through your feelings must accord with reality.

86
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.220
It's just dangerous. The field somethings, or I feel that water would be nice.

87
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.710
And that the science saying that there are sharks in there,

88
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.490
shouldn't be getting in the way of me having a good swim, you know?

89
00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:57.630
And then the other one,

90
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.210
this problem gets to the heart of what we're talking about.

91
00:05:00.211 --> 00:05:04.530
We teach our children that the dividing line between good and bad is between

92
00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:07.620
people or that bad life is a battle between good and bad people.

93
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.010
That's a disaster to disaster. Yeah.

94
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.270
<v 1>Most people on the other side believe that they're good too. They may be wrong.</v>

95
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.141
<v 0>Well,</v>

96
00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:20.430
not only that we're all a mixture and why can't we go on a journey even right.

97
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.730
Quite a bit about how you've been on a journey politically. Yeah. Well,

98
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.940
isn't that a good thing, you know,

99
00:05:26.941 --> 00:05:30.520
to think things through and to learn from your mistakes. Um,

100
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.350
forgive me, it's not for me to say that you made mistakes or whatever,

101
00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:35.184
but I know.

102
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.650
<v 1>I have absolutely made mistakes. I promise you.</v>

103
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.060
<v 0>Now in the lexicon of those who hold the microphones in our society,</v>

104
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.410
and you see that with social media, the thing we're talking about earlier,

105
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.290
who make a mistake,

106
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.130
and this brought up against you 30 years later to keep you out of public office,

107
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.680
when you might've grown enormously as a human being,

108
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.430
and you might've asked those that you heard or that you've mischarged,

109
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.820
but what are the mistakes you made for forgiveness?

110
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.520
You grow up in a normal city, you've come to a different place.

111
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.050
Why should we not respect them?

112
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.570
<v 1>Do you think, oddly though,</v>

113
00:06:04.571 --> 00:06:08.710
that the end of secularism leads us to that place of unforgiveness,

114
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.830
do you think that is sort of what you were talking about earlier that if you

115
00:06:11.831 --> 00:06:16.000
remove all of whatever traditional belief there is that you will end up in a

116
00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:18.220
place that will be so subjective,

117
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.490
that how would forgiveness even make sense in that world?

118
00:06:21.491 --> 00:06:24.820
That sort of seems to me where we're sort of at, at the moment. Yeah.

119
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.590
<v 0>I mean, this is a great thing. Now it's all about power.</v>

120
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.850
Everyone talks about power, but it's, it's very inadequate.

121
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.870
Douglas Murray says it.

122
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.610
If you walk up and most people in the street and say what most matters to you

123
00:06:36.611 --> 00:06:37.900
most, they won't say power.

124
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.480
They'll talk about love that talking about relationship. And so,

125
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.790
but I think relationship in the Western model draws an enormous amount from

126
00:06:45.791 --> 00:06:49.870
our understanding of that thing called the cross and the central message.

127
00:06:49.871 --> 00:06:54.550
There was a death, um, a life's rendered,

128
00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.070
uh, for enemies out of love, loving your enemies.

129
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.430
We can't even love our friends half the time. Yeah.

130
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.470
We need to learn to love our enemies again,

131
00:07:05.471 --> 00:07:10.240
which is why I think I'm all for vigor in debate. I love what you do.

132
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.090
I love what Jordan Peterson does. I love what, so, I mean,

133
00:07:13.091 --> 00:07:14.170
this is a big part of the picture.

134
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:19.150
You've got an enormous intellectual vigor coming back into Western life

135
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.980
and that's tremendously encouraging.

136
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.000
And it's an enormous privilege just to pay a tiny little bit. You know,

137
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.230
I hope in facilitating that with my own website, for example, and so forth.

138
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.770
But I see this as tremendously encouraging, but we've,

139
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:35.710
we've got to break the very model.

140
00:07:35.711 --> 00:07:38.800
That's brought us to us in the first books to that place in the first place,

141
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.200
which is the rejection of the idea of respect and recognition of the worth and

142
00:07:44.201 --> 00:07:45.034
dignity of others.

143
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.870
<v 1>Are you amazed how this is a truly worldwide phenomenon right now?</v>

144
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.630
So that's why I started the interview by saying that, you know,

145
00:07:52.631 --> 00:07:55.900
you sent me this email three years ago and then, you know,

146
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.450
flash forward basically, uh, two and a half years,

147
00:07:58.451 --> 00:08:01.720
and I'm in Australia and I'm doing this event with you and everyone in that room

148
00:08:01.721 --> 00:08:04.300
knew who I was and now most of them were there for Jordan.

149
00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:05.470
And I can see that point,

150
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:10.240
but the basic idea that what we're talking about in America

151
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.760
is the same thing you're talking about in Australia.

152
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.470
It's the same thing they're talking about France,

153
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:15.730
and they're talking about it in Mexico.

154
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:20.350
It's not purely a Western society idea anymore. It's everywhere. Now.

155
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:24.730
<v 0>It is, it is indeed. And a couple of observations. Uh,</v>

156
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.550
the wealthiest countries in particular,

157
00:08:27.551 --> 00:08:30.880
where it's been very easy for a long time, have lost sight.

158
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.520
I think of the idea of suffering and suffering can be very

159
00:08:36.521 --> 00:08:40.780
instrumental in determining character and resilience, uh,

160
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.930
and compassion for others because you understand,

161
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:49.030
we've got rid of the idea that suffering, um, you know,

162
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.570
is part of life. We try to pretend we can build perfect society,

163
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:56.280
which is why people make unreal demands on government. You know,

164
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.390
we don't need gardening or none of that stuff. We don't need suffering anymore.

165
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:05.040
So Mr. Congressman, I expect you to solve every year, give me everything,

166
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:06.030
give me everything.

167
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:11.190
And Mr. Congressmen has been unwise enough to often if there's a congressmen

168
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:12.240
listening, please say,

169
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.130
I can say exactly the same about what I was presented or a Senator in Australia.

170
00:09:17.131 --> 00:09:20.040
We have senators just like you do. Uh, we have a wash minster,

171
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.730
a house of representatives based on the British house of commons.

172
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.800
Our Senate is modeled exactly on your sentence. So we call it a wash. Um,

173
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:33.090
and we we've just got to break that cycle again and rediscover some routes or,

174
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.310
or this is the one that, you know,

175
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.710
conservative doesn't believe that the people who have gone before them were

176
00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:38.544
lesser,

177
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:41.760
but our culture now seems to think that those who went before us had nothing to

178
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:43.050
teach us. That is a fatal.

179
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.000
