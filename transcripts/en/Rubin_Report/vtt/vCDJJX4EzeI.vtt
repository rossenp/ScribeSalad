00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.140
<v 0>On election night when Donald Trump came out in the early hours of the morning</v>

2
00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:08.460
and said, um, I believe we've already won.

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.560
We've won. As far as I'm concerned. He said, I gasped I gas. I thought,

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.220
Oh, how? And there's several things about that.

5
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.150
One is you better. If you're the Trump team,

6
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.740
you better provide really good fast about that. And frankly,

7
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.810
what they've provided is not good enough proof yet they have

8
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.700
been providing, uh,

9
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.480
some things that sound to me like they are conspiracy theories,

10
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:39.120
unless they've got a lot of stuff to come. I hope for their sake.

11
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:40.200
They've got a lot of stuff to come,

12
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.920
or there are a lot of reputations that are being trashed all the time.

13
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.910
More than eight out of 10 Trump voters in the last poll I saw

14
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.930
believe Donald Trump won the election.

15
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.980
And obviously Joe Biden's voters believe he won.

16
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.170
This seems to me a very perilous moment for democracy.

17
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.340
It's what I just described in cabinets on a national level,

18
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.680
you saw the same thing and you've come away with different

19
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:17.514
conclusions.

20
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.560
<v 1>You think would be a responsible way for the media to talk about this then,</v>

21
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.020
because one of the things I've been trying to do for the last couple of weeks

22
00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:28.370
here is I'm saying, look, I don't know exactly what happened.

23
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.900
I don't think anyone really knows.

24
00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:34.790
I do know that at about midnight Pacific time here that about eight

25
00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:38.630
States that Trump had healthy leads in all stopped voting at the same exact

26
00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:41.180
time. I'm not saying Trump won will, you know,

27
00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:43.700
now it's going to go to the courts and there's all sorts of things happening,

28
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.170
but I've at least been trying to talk about it respectfully. Right?

29
00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:51.560
So that it allows people to see, okay, let the process work.

30
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.340
And then at the end, if it comes out that yes, did I want Trump to win? Yes.

31
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.590
But if, if the courts look, look at everything and he doesn't win,

32
00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.503
then so be it.

33
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.780
But I think what a lot of people are frustrated that that eight out of 10,

34
00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:03.680
you just referenced.

35
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.000
I think what they're seeing is that the media won't even let you talk about it

36
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.560
and that if you talk about it,

37
00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:12.950
you're going to be put on a list and you're going to be labeled a conspiracy

38
00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:16.010
theorist, and you're going to get booted from social media and the rest of it.

39
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:18.230
And that strikes me as more of a problem.

40
00:02:18.231 --> 00:02:21.380
Maybe then what actually happened at some point.

41
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.290
<v 0>Well, no, I disagree with that. I mean,</v>

42
00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:29.180
I think the biggest problem is if the president doesn't leave

43
00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:31.370
the white house and he's lost.

44
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.560
<v 1>If we get there and he, and he has actually yes.</v>

45
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.560
<v 0>Of course. I mean, you know, look, I'm,</v>

46
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.090
I'm sympathetic to much of your argument and your, your point of view on this.

47
00:02:44.091 --> 00:02:45.980
But I mean that, and I, by the way,

48
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.660
I'm particularly irate about the fact that there are so many Democrats who

49
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.980
spent four years claiming that the American voting system had been fundamentally

50
00:02:54.981 --> 00:02:55.581
undermined.

51
00:02:55.581 --> 00:02:59.200
And indeed the Russians had stolen the 2016 election something for which they

52
00:02:59.201 --> 00:03:01.840
never showed us any evidence, but they asserted. Anyway.

53
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.600
<v 1>He literally said that, that it was an illegitimate election. I mean, it's yeah.</v>

54
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.040
<v 0>I'm, I'm I'm I read about that. I was, I raved about him for four years.</v>

55
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.220
I'm I read about the fact that the same people now pretend that there is no such

56
00:03:14.221 --> 00:03:17.520
thing as voter fraud in America. However,

57
00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.440
the owners at this stage is on Donald Trump and his legal team to

58
00:03:22.441 --> 00:03:26.040
prove that he won the election. Now I have to say,

59
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.070
I've paid fairly close attention to this. As I say, I mean, I, first of all,

60
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.750
I said the thing of going to bed and the result being different when you wake up

61
00:03:33.751 --> 00:03:38.220
is, is not unheard of in elections. I mean, in the Brexit vote,

62
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.300
lots of people went to bed thinking that, um, uh,

63
00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:44.730
that Britain was going to remain in the European union.

64
00:03:44.731 --> 00:03:45.900
I remember it very clearly.

65
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.310
And of course then suddenly the results from Sunderland and elsewhere in the

66
00:03:50.311 --> 00:03:52.320
North of England came through and wash.

67
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.830
We were out and the same people woke up the next morning, amazed,

68
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.460
but that's what happens sometimes and our actions. Um,

69
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.020
I do think that Donald Trump, uh, is behaving reprehensible at the moment.

70
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.940
I think that frankly,

71
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.490
I am very open for any and all explanations of voter fraud as

72
00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:14.070
it is going on in America, as it has gone on.

73
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.790
I think whoever is president on January the 20th,

74
00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:22.560
rather than as a point of absolute urgency should put together

75
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.720
a bipartisan nonpartisan cross-party is anting to look into

76
00:04:27.721 --> 00:04:30.690
voter fraud, specifically mail-in voter fraud in the United States of America.

77
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.200
You cannot have another election after this one,

78
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.410
which would be a third in a row where people didn't believe the results if they

79
00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:40.800
lost. So it seems to me to be real point of urgency, this,

80
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.290
but on election night,

81
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.790
when Donald Trump came out in the early hours of the morning and said, um,

82
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.740
I believe we've already won. We've won. As far as I'm concerned. He said,

83
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.340
I gas, I gas. I thought, Oh, how,

84
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.500
and there's several things about that. One is you better.

85
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.030
If you're the Trump team, you better provide really good fast about that.

86
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.470
And frankly,

87
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.540
what they've provided is not good enough proof yet they have

88
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.400
been providing, uh,

89
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.210
some things that sound to me like they are conspiracy theories,

90
00:05:18.211 --> 00:05:20.820
unless they've got a lot of stuff to come. I hope for their sake,

91
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:21.930
they've got a lot of stuff to come,

92
00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:25.350
or there are a lot of reputations that are being trashed all the time.

93
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.930
<v 1>Well, that's what I said from [inaudible] it's like Sidney Powell,</v>

94
00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:30.120
she's either self emulating in front of us,

95
00:05:30.121 --> 00:05:34.470
or she's about to break the greatest story in the history of modern times.

96
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.820
It's it's one or the other, right?

97
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.570
<v 0>Yeah. The suspect it's the first. Uh,</v>

98
00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:42.760
and I think the same with Rudy Giuliani, you, you,

99
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.190
you can't give press conferences talking about dead Venezuelan leaders

100
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.990
and think that the citizenry should, I mean,

101
00:05:51.991 --> 00:05:54.420
it's not just that you shouldn't treat the citizenry stupidly,

102
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.090
you should not mislead people's belief in the most

103
00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:00.890
fundamental thing in our nations,

104
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.880
which is that we vote and some people win and some people lose them, you know,

105
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.170
who's lost and who's won. This is a really dangerous thing.

106
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.650
This is a dangerous element to be playing with. And,

107
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.100
and I worry deeply about the consequences of this.

108
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.840
But another thing to point out about this is that,

109
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.570
you know, I mean, you, everyone has to lose.

110
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:28.220
Sometimes I remember Michael Barone saying this to some conservative gathering

111
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.380
as once that many years ago. I think like Brian said, you know,

112
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.920
you have to lose some times, you know,

113
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.650
the evidence so far seems to be that the Republican nominee for the presidency

114
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.340
lost this time. Now here's, here's the kicker,

115
00:06:45.341 --> 00:06:48.670
if I may say so for four years,

116
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.000
the question one of the questions has been,

117
00:06:52.001 --> 00:06:55.330
why has Donald Trump not been able to recruit? Now,

118
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.360
there have been some very remarkable people who have worked for him and I

119
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.080
wouldn't do down any of them. I'm thinking of people like,

120
00:07:01.081 --> 00:07:05.980
I think secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, um, uh, uh,

121
00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.470
Elliot Abrams and others are some very,

122
00:07:08.471 --> 00:07:11.050
very serious particular foreign policy figures who have worked for me.

123
00:07:11.051 --> 00:07:14.950
I deeply admire, but there has been a question throughout the Trump presidency.

124
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.430
Why can he not, uh,

125
00:07:17.431 --> 00:07:21.820
appear to get more people working with him?

126
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:27.460
Uh, more experienced people working for him, older hands, more trusted figures,

127
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:32.440
some non-family would be nice, uh, and so on and so forth.

128
00:07:32.441 --> 00:07:35.080
What is the explanation? And I, you know,

129
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.350
it's one of those political questions that ends up answering itself.

130
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.400
It's because everyone worried, but at the end of the run,

131
00:07:42.401 --> 00:07:46.390
he would pull some crap like this. That was why,

132
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:51.520
that was why I spoke to a lot of people in recent years in America and

133
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.270
said to them, you know, in American friends and said, you know,

134
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.410
would you consider taking this post? Why don't you consider taking that role?

135
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.920
And I always noticed that some of them, you know, early on and I would say,

136
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.940
you know, he's got four years in office. It's not nothing to be,

137
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.680
whatever position was being discussed. And I noticed always this reticence,

138
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:16.600
I think Neil Ferguson on your show said that there was always this risk that

139
00:08:16.601 --> 00:08:20.860
Trump was going to do something or come down in a way that was a scandal of

140
00:08:20.861 --> 00:08:25.120
Nixon of not only Nixonian proportions, but that would make Nixon look like,

141
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.350
you know, sort of a tea party, tea party means something else. Yeah.

142
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:35.590
Not a British team. Well, yeah. Yeah. [inaudible] okay. Cool.

143
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.760
I think, uh, and, and I think that's, um,

144
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.800
I think that what we're seeing at the moment may be the answer to

145
00:08:44.801 --> 00:08:47.950
that question. I have seen it once else in politics,

146
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.990
in European continental politics with a much more minor political figure who the

147
00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:56.970
same question was, why can't people around, why don't people trust them?

148
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:02.040
And in the end, the answer answered itself because he was going to in the end,

149
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.780
Paul crazy crappy poles. And, and I just,

150
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.820
I think less and less, the Trump team can very,

151
00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:16.140
very swiftly provide evidence that is very good and persuasive.

152
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.580
They are playing with an element that they should not be playing with.

153
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.560
And I think it will,

154
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:27.300
it will deeply diminish the Republican party. If it allows it to go on,

155
00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:28.710
it will diminish conservatives.

156
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:32.910
It will diminish the millions of millions of decent American voters who were

157
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:36.390
trying to send a very distinct message in 2016,

158
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:39.960
who were reviled for four years, insulted for four years,

159
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:42.150
called every imaginable name in for four years,

160
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:47.310
it will further demoralize them. And we can them.

161
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:52.060
I hope I hope if he has something, it comes out. Yeah.

162
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:53.060
<v 1>By the way, Douglas, you know,</v>

163
00:09:53.061 --> 00:09:56.960
while I'm obviously sympathetic to the campaign and I wanted him to win,

164
00:09:56.961 --> 00:09:58.730
I'm completely with you on that. It's like, if,

165
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.890
if there isn't anything there and they,

166
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:05.690
and they've truly done something here that was to destroy the system or

167
00:10:05.691 --> 00:10:07.660
completely erode trust or anything else. Yeah.

168
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.150
Then it's almost the most dangerous thing. Well, I guess it would be the second,

169
00:10:11.151 --> 00:10:15.080
most dangerous thing, you know, compared to actually rigging the election. So,

170
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.560
you know, w w we'll find out over the next couple of weeks.

171
00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.050
<v 0>If they have, if they, if you have Democrats did actually bring the election,</v>

172
00:10:21.051 --> 00:10:24.800
then it is indeed it is the most appalling crime against American democracy.

173
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:29.420
And there should be, uh, such a thorough investigation.

174
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.330
And so many people go into prison.

175
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.210
It would be the scandal of our lifetimes,

176
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.710
but if it isn't the case, if it isn't the case,

177
00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.300
then it is also a great scandal because you cannot lie to the citizen about

178
00:10:44.301 --> 00:10:47.390
this. I mean, I'm very, I'm very open to the argument of, you know,

179
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.220
four years ago, Hillary Clinton didn't really admit that she lost the election.

180
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.860
I spent years pretending she had only lost election because of the Russians and

181
00:10:54.861 --> 00:10:58.130
something to do with a box on Facebook. A lot.

182
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.090
I thought that was contemptible. I think Hillary Clinton was again,

183
00:11:02.091 --> 00:11:06.050
playing with fire to do her, the one piece of credit that one can do.

184
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:10.820
At least she didn't actually tunnel into the oval office and barricade herself

185
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.950
in it after the election in 2016.

186
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.370
It's the one thing Hillary Clinton has going for.

187
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.220
