00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:08.480
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.100
<v 1>All right. People, how you doing everybody? It is November 10,</v>

3
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.290
Tuesday, November 10th.

4
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.160
We are one week to the day from the election.

5
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.760
It seems like it either happened five minutes ago or a lifetime ago,

6
00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:27.740
depending on, uh, your outlook on life. But it is one week ago. Uh,

7
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.820
we sort of have her result, kind of have her result. We have a result.

8
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.850
If you like the result, we don't have a result. If you don't like the result,

9
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.050
that and much more on today's direct message. I'm in a good mood this morning.

10
00:00:39.051 --> 00:00:41.630
I have an absolutely packed day today. Uh,

11
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.460
I just did an interview with the Epic times.

12
00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:47.870
They came here and we shot something in studio. I'm going to be on Dana.

13
00:00:47.871 --> 00:00:52.670
Perino right after this on Fox news, I was on OAM this morning.

14
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.270
We got a couple of other things going on, just a lot. It's a lot.

15
00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.800
And it's all good. I wake up. I've got something to do. I hope you do as well.

16
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.680
Uh, today the three stories that we're going to be covering,

17
00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:06.710
I suspect you heard about at least two of them already.

18
00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:11.120
And then the third one is just a hilarious bananas, uh, media meltdown story.

19
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.150
Uh, but first we're going to be talking about Mitch McConnell. You know,

20
00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:16.070
Mitch McConnell, the man looks like a turtle,

21
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.030
but he acts like a lion. Uh,

22
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.860
he is not going to be listening to the Democrats who were saying that you

23
00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:29.450
guys better be nice now because y'all lost. Um,

24
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.130
and he is ready to go all cocaine Mitch up in here, as they say.

25
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.790
So replay a little video from Mitch McConnell. We'll talk about that. Uh,

26
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.660
then of course the,

27
00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:41.680
the big news today that really should supersede everything else.

28
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.140
Although you're not going to see much about it on mainstream media,

29
00:01:45.141 --> 00:01:47.780
could it doesn't fit the narrative, um,

30
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.810
is that the department of justice is going to probe quote,

31
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.650
substantial allegations of voting irregularities.

32
00:01:54.651 --> 00:01:57.110
This is from attorney general BARR,

33
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.820
and we will see what happens as I said yesterday,

34
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.970
regardless if you want it, buy it into winner Trump to win.

35
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:08.330
What you should want is a feeling of integrity in the system.

36
00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:13.280
You should want any legal, legal recourse to take its action to, you know,

37
00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:17.120
go to the end. And then you would want all parties,

38
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.220
whether it's Trump or Biden to abide by whatever the outcome is. So again,

39
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.550
there were the results of the election have not been certified.

40
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.050
Technically Joe Biden is not the president elect. The media has said that he is,

41
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.140
uh, there are some interesting things coming out of Michigan and Arizona and

42
00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:36.770
everything where else I am not trying to send you guys down a spiral of

43
00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:40.490
conspiracy theories. I'm just talking about what I'm seeing.

44
00:02:40.491 --> 00:02:43.790
And unfortunately that the mainstream media isn't covering most of it.

45
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.070
So we'll dive into that. And then third, uh,

46
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.900
there's a video going viral right now. It's absolutely hilarious from MSNBC.

47
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.340
When, uh, one of their correspondents, he said some dirty words,

48
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.490
something happened and he said some dirty words and it's,

49
00:02:58.491 --> 00:03:02.530
and it's just when these robotic people that we watch on mainstream,

50
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.450
when you actually see that they are truly humans or at least part humans,

51
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.580
something like that. Uh, so we'll play that.

52
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.460
But before we get to any event people,

53
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.080
are you looking for a new protein bar that tastes like a candy bar? Well, if so,

54
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.550
I've got just the brand for you and I'm holding it in my hand,

55
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.020
built bars right here. They're super tasty. They come in 18 amazing flavors.

56
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:27.760
My personal favorite, as you know,

57
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.910
is the cookies and cream bill bars are covered in a hundred percent.

58
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.560
Chocolate include both nut and nut-free flavor is under soft and easy to

59
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:38.770
chew with the holidays just around the corner. It's easy to slip up,

60
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.000
which is why bill bars are the perfect alternative to pie for the health

61
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:43.930
conscious guy.

62
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.590
I can actually lose your maintain weight while indulging in a delicious treat.

63
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.650

67
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.290
Good for bar is built, go or build the boost. And now back to me,

68
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.513
all right,

69
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.050
so let's talk about the state of politics right now. You know,

70
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:13.720
I promised you when I started this show that I wasn't going to get into the

71
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:16.960
nitty gritty of every little political fight,

72
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.100
because I think that's part of the problem that we are all so obsessed with

73
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:25.060
every little thing that happens politically as if every little thing that

74
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:28.750
happens politically is going to affect our lives and a good government would be

75
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:31.180
nice and tight and you could fit it in a little box.

76
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.240
You could wrap it in a bow and you could put it aside because it wouldn't have

77
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:36.610
that much power over your lives. That being said,

78
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:39.490
sometimes there are stories politically that do matter.

79
00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:42.550
And I think that the story that matters right now, well, of course,

80
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:44.800
you've got the results of the election,

81
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:47.710
but then we do also have what's happening with the house and the Senate.

82
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:50.860
And it is important to know because you know,

83
00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:53.590
when the founders set up this crazy system that we have,

84
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.100
they gave us three branches of government and they can check each other and they

85
00:04:57.101 --> 00:04:58.390
can balance each other out.

86
00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:01.960
And that makes it so that nobody can be too powerful.

87
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.380
And we don't end up living under a King, which is a good thing,

88
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.950
at least from where I sit. So let's take a look at this video.

89
00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:12.370
This is from C-SPAN. This is Mitch McConnell, uh,

90
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.840
pushing back on the idea that Republicans need to be lectured to now about

91
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:21.670
civility and how to, how to take a loss and, and the whole thing, Mitch.

92
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.510
<v 2>Now more broadly, Mr. President, let's not have any lectures,</v>

93
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.160
no lectures about how the president should immediately cheerfully except

94
00:05:32.161 --> 00:05:36.840
preliminary election results from the same characters who just spent four years

95
00:05:36.841 --> 00:05:39.450
refusing to accept the validity of the last election

96
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.420
and who insinuated that this one would be

97
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:49.560
illegitimate to if they lost again,

98
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.350
only if they lost.

99
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.860
So let's have no lectures on this subject from that contention in late

100
00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:00.290
August, secretary Hillary Clinton said, quote,

101
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.710
Joe Biden should not concede under any circumstances.

102
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.000
I think this is going to drag out and he will win it.

103
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.650
If we don't give an inch that same month

104
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.580
speaker Pelosi and the democratic leader, both stated quote,

105
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.480
president Trump needs to cheat to win

106
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.020
in October when speaker Pelosi was shopping some conspiracy theory about

107
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:31.880
the postal service. She reckless has said, quote, listen to this.

108
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:33.980
I have no doubt that the president will lie,

109
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.210
cheat and steal to win the election. Now,

110
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:43.040
does this sound like a chorus that has any credibility

111
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.600
whatsoever to say a few legal challenges from president Trump

112
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:49.580
represents some kind of crisis.

113
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.520
<v 1>All right. People. So what did Mitch McConnell do there? What did he just do?</v>

114
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.760
He used quotes. He used actual quotes,

115
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.650
things that people like Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi have said

116
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.100
over the past couple of years about what happened last time.

117
00:07:09.101 --> 00:07:12.700
And what's going to happen this time. I should also add that Hillary Clinton,

118
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:13.210
uh,

119
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.720
has repeatedly said in interviews over the last four years that the election was

120
00:07:16.721 --> 00:07:20.020
stolen from her. Okay. Those are her words.

121
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.370
So now suddenly the same people who for four years didn't accept the results of

122
00:07:24.371 --> 00:07:25.570
the election. Let's not forget.

123
00:07:25.571 --> 00:07:30.460
We had basically two years of a Russian collusion hoax that led

124
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.770
to an impeachment scam.

125
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.400
And we were told we have to believe this stuff. Okay.

126
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.070
And that we shouldn't even question whether it's true or not.

127
00:07:39.071 --> 00:07:40.150
We have to believe it.

128
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.540
I want to tell you a personal story in the midst of all of this,

129
00:07:43.541 --> 00:07:48.160
because back in December, when impeachment was just heating up, I did,

130
00:07:48.161 --> 00:07:52.570
I gave a talk one morning at a, at a turning point USA event.

131
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.600
And then that night, and you've probably heard me talk about this.

132
00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.190
I actually had dinner with, uh, Trump Jr. David and I had dinner with Trump Jr.

133
00:08:00.191 --> 00:08:02.230
And Kimberly Guilfoyle at Mar-a-Lago.

134
00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:05.230
I know they're supposed to be big homophobes and I'm sure the place doesn't let

135
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.590
in gay people, but okay. It was all good. We had dinner and,

136
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.140
and Trump now remember, this is the middle of impeachment.

137
00:08:11.141 --> 00:08:12.760
It had just started taking off. You know,

138
00:08:12.761 --> 00:08:14.680
it was probably a week or two in something like that.

139
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.230
And Trump is sitting there in the room.

140
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.280
We're one table away from Trump and Giuliani was there a couple other people

141
00:08:21.281 --> 00:08:23.050
were there. He was sitting next to the first lady.

142
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.680
And every story that day was the walls are closing.

143
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.390
And they're coming for Trump paranoia in the white house. He knows he's guilty.

144
00:08:31.391 --> 00:08:33.880
We're going to take him out in chains, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

145
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.940
I was looking at Trump. He was literally eight feet away from me.

146
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.310
He had no tie on, which is weird to see him without a tie.

147
00:08:39.311 --> 00:08:41.950
Cause he's always got to tie his hair. It was like the end of the day.

148
00:08:41.951 --> 00:08:45.160
So his hair was like a little lower than usual kind of floppier than usual.

149
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.040
And he was laughing up a storm. This was in the middle of the,

150
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:53.230
the impeachment thing. Okay. Now I mentioned that because the point is,

151
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.790
it seems to me that he,

152
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.910
that he didn't do anything and that it was going to come out to be a scam,

153
00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:03.000
which is exactly what it did. That doesn't mean you have to love Trump.

154
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.740
It just is what it is.

155
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.880
So the point that McConnell is making is that these people,

156
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:11.400
the mainstream media, the democratic establishment,

157
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:16.290
they have lied to us for years because they didn't accept the results of the

158
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:19.290
election. They did everything they could to undermine the last election.

159
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.140
Now they seemingly got what they want.

160
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.360
And now you're not allowed to question anything,

161
00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:28.770
which is why CNN and the New York times and everywhere else is just constantly

162
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:30.240
telling us there's no proof of anything.

163
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:31.860
Now we don't know if there's proof of anything.

164
00:09:31.861 --> 00:09:35.750
There's been some interesting things that we're seeing on Twitter, right?

165
00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:38.060
We're seeing some ads, evidence of something.

166
00:09:38.061 --> 00:09:42.620
But if you guys won't even show us that, right, if you just dismiss it,

167
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.760
right. Tapper, Jake Tapper and Stelter and the rest of these guys,

168
00:09:46.761 --> 00:09:50.360
if you just dismiss it and ignore it, instead of showing people,

169
00:09:50.361 --> 00:09:52.640
why don't you just debunk it? But they won't do that.

170
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.120
They won't do that because they think it'll give it energy. But ironically,

171
00:09:56.121 --> 00:09:58.310
what that does there, they're ignoring of,

172
00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:02.480
of the stories that are coming out of Michigan and coming out of Pennsylvania

173
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.310
and everywhere else, whether they're true or not,

174
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.290
or whether they're widespread or not,

175
00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:09.860
or if they're enough of anything to cause a reversal of a result or anything

176
00:10:09.861 --> 00:10:14.750
like that when they ignore it, the average person that sees these stories goes,

177
00:10:14.751 --> 00:10:17.240
wait a minute. It does seem like something here.

178
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.480
Suddenly 3000 votes showed up providing, I don't know.

179
00:10:20.481 --> 00:10:25.070
It seems like a little and they're ignoring it. So it's like, Oh,

180
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.680
well there may be something is there. Cause I don't trust the mainstream media.

181
00:10:27.681 --> 00:10:28.760
And in many ways,

182
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.660
this election is far more about distrust in the mainstream media than it,

183
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:33.770
than anything else.

184
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:39.080
Last thing that I'll say on this real quick is that it's odd

185
00:10:39.081 --> 00:10:42.830
to see someone like Mitch McConnell, who comes off as you know, he's,

186
00:10:42.831 --> 00:10:45.680
he's very quiet and you know, he's got, he actually has some health issues,

187
00:10:45.681 --> 00:10:48.980
which is a little bit of, of explaining some of his posture and everything else.

188
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.850
Um, but he is actually come out. Yeah.

189
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.550
To be someone that seems pretty principled in this.

190
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.060
He's not saying you don't accept the results of the election. And by the way,

191
00:10:59.061 --> 00:11:02.240
I haven't seen anyone say, you don't accept the results of the election.

192
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.370
Of course you say, accept the results of the election,

193
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.620
but let's call out the hypocrisy.

194
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.720
It's let the system go through the processes.

195
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.950
So that at the end, you know, what if turns out that the votes aren't there,

196
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.680
I guarantee you Trump's gonna walk, but what is he going to do?

197
00:11:18.681 --> 00:11:21.200
He's going to hold up in the white house. And,

198
00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.620
and the military is going to defend him. Like, no, that's,

199
00:11:23.621 --> 00:11:26.000
that's not how it's going to work. Um,

200
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:30.710
but the idea that somehow we have to be nice right now and they ha and they're,

201
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.720
you know, they're reaching out and we have to be nice after what they just did.

202
00:11:35.721 --> 00:11:37.310
Like I'm all for reaching out.

203
00:11:37.311 --> 00:11:40.190
I think I've tried to do this show to build bridges and the rest of it,

204
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.790
but we have to understand the hypocrisy when we see it. Uh,

205
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.830
but before I get to story, number two,

206
00:11:45.831 --> 00:11:49.640
I want to talk to you guys about top resume because we just did some hiring here

207
00:11:49.641 --> 00:11:52.280
at the Rubin report. Our businesses are blowing up because you know what,

208
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.980
we're doing something decent, uh,

209
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.710
with today's high employment rates and uncertain future,

210
00:11:56.711 --> 00:12:01.130
it's hard to plan in a bed yet alone. Look for a new job here.

211
00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.380
The report, we understand that that struggle is real. And as I said,

212
00:12:04.381 --> 00:12:07.770
we just finished hiring a new position and realized very quickly how important

213
00:12:07.771 --> 00:12:10.620

238
00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:37.680
And now back to me, all right, so attorney general,

239
00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.600
Bob BARR, as they're saying on the Twitter he's been activated.

240
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:44.880
So what is happening right now? Well,

241
00:13:44.881 --> 00:13:48.480
the department of justice and that's the department that the attorney general is

242
00:13:48.481 --> 00:13:49.470
in charge of,

243
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:54.300
he is now decided to do a probe to quote,

244
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:59.340
check back the substantial allegations of voting irregularities.

245
00:13:59.341 --> 00:14:03.780
So let me get it the, the exact quote, because I'm a hell of a journalist.

246
00:14:03.781 --> 00:14:07.350
Apparently, even though I don't consider myself a journalist, this is Bob BARR.

247
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:10.200
He said, uh, I'm sorry, this is from the associated press,

248
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:14.460
the Trump administration through the presidential transition into tumbled on

249
00:14:14.461 --> 00:14:15.510
Monday, uh,

250
00:14:15.511 --> 00:14:20.430
attorney general William Barr authorizing the justice department to

251
00:14:20.431 --> 00:14:25.350
probe allegations of voter fraud and president Donald Trump firing the Pentagon

252
00:14:25.351 --> 00:14:29.280
chief and blocking government officials from cooperating with presidents and

253
00:14:29.281 --> 00:14:32.310
elect Joe Biden's team. Okay.

254
00:14:32.311 --> 00:14:37.230
So to basically unpack this Bob BARR, you may remember the video,

255
00:14:37.231 --> 00:14:40.350
maybe we'll even cover this tomorrow, but you know, we will cover this tomorrow.

256
00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:41.940
Uh, there is a video from,

257
00:14:41.941 --> 00:14:46.590
I think it's about two or three months ago where Bob BARR was being, uh,

258
00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:50.040
there was a Bob BARR, it's bill BARR, it's bill bar, bill bar.

259
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:55.280
I got bars and I got bill BARR. I keep calling him Bob bar, bill bar, sorry,

260
00:14:55.281 --> 00:14:59.570
guys. Uh, there's a video from about two months ago when bill BARR,

261
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:04.460
William bill BARR was on CNN and he was being interviewed by Wolf

262
00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:09.110
Blitzer about voter fraud and voter irregularities and what he would do and how

263
00:15:09.111 --> 00:15:13.190
mail-in ballots are changing things and offer more, uh,

264
00:15:13.191 --> 00:15:17.540
room for malfeasance and all of that. And there's a really interesting clip.

265
00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:20.060
It's probably about a minute or two. We'll play it tomorrow, uh,

266
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:21.560
so that you can actually see the clip,

267
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.780
but he was warning that there could be fraud.

268
00:15:23.781 --> 00:15:26.630
And of course there can be fraud in any election.

269
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.630
I suspect if some of the things that we're seeing right now,

270
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:33.110
we saw in some election in Eastern Europe,

271
00:15:33.111 --> 00:15:37.670
say Ukraine or some election in North Africa that we might say, Oh,

272
00:15:37.671 --> 00:15:40.920
maybe something weird went there and the media would be running with it. If,

273
00:15:40.921 --> 00:15:45.050
if the media didn't get the result that they wanted. So in essence,

274
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:49.040
what bill BARR is doing, who's Bob BARR. I don't know who Bob BARR is.

275
00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:52.790
Wasn't there was there a democratic politician named Bob BARR long time ago.

276
00:15:52.791 --> 00:15:54.550
He kind of looked like a mouse. He had a little mustache,

277
00:15:54.551 --> 00:15:58.000
can we Google Bob BARR? I think there was a guy named Bob BARR. Uh,

278
00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:02.800
but in any essence, in any event, bill BARR, uh,

279
00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:06.820
is going bill bar exam. It really bill bar right there.

280
00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.320
Um, they're gonna look into it now that doesn't mean that they're going to do

281
00:16:11.321 --> 00:16:13.720
anything. And by the way, by looking into it,

282
00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.620
that would then if you've got 70 million people who were just going, you know,

283
00:16:17.621 --> 00:16:21.280
something ain't quite right and we don't trust them mainstream media,

284
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:25.210
well then looking into it, letting things go to the courts where then, you know,

285
00:16:25.211 --> 00:16:26.770
it's very hard to fake the data.

286
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.820
I actually have talked to a couple experts on this and a couple people really in

287
00:16:30.821 --> 00:16:34.270
the know about elections and what virtually everyone has said to me is it's

288
00:16:34.271 --> 00:16:34.631
very,

289
00:16:34.631 --> 00:16:38.440
very hard to fake the data in a way that wouldn't be obvious if you're faking

290
00:16:38.441 --> 00:16:41.080
it. So by the justice department,

291
00:16:41.081 --> 00:16:44.500
looking into these allegations, well,

292
00:16:44.501 --> 00:16:46.060
then they'll get to get the papers in front of them.

293
00:16:46.061 --> 00:16:48.340
They're going to look at the numbers and then they have all sorts of math

294
00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:51.040
equations and everything else that they can look and they can see,

295
00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.790
is there something really wacky here like did a hundred thousand votes show up

296
00:16:54.791 --> 00:16:58.540
at 3:00 AM for one candidate and nothing for the other candidate that would be

297
00:16:58.541 --> 00:17:00.790
odd, but they know what they're looking for.

298
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:02.920
And letting the justice department look at this,

299
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:07.570
I think is absolutely completely fine. And then by the way, as I just said,

300
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:11.560
at the end, you get to the end of it. And at the end they go, you know what?

301
00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.110
We didn't find anything. We did not find anything.

302
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.720
Or we found some things that were inconsequential,

303
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:19.750
or maybe we found some stuff in one state.

304
00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.380
That's not enough to change the results of the election or whatever it is. Well,

305
00:17:23.381 --> 00:17:25.450
then you've let the process play out.

306
00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.090
But what I'm seeing right now from a lot of people,

307
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.380
a lot of people sort of in the skeptic community and generally people who,

308
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.850
who are sort of, um, I would say skeptical of power, right?

309
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.560
Suddenly everyone's saying, no, we can't look at anything.

310
00:17:38.561 --> 00:17:39.341
We can't look at anything.

311
00:17:39.341 --> 00:17:41.770
And that's what the mainstream media is pushing on you.

312
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:45.580
And that's what Twitter will sensor and everything else. So all of these things,

313
00:17:45.581 --> 00:17:48.790
I mean, again, all of the things that we always talk about here,

314
00:17:48.791 --> 00:17:53.370
they sort of widdle into how are you as a

315
00:17:53.371 --> 00:17:57.630
person supposed to figure out what is true in the mix of this.

316
00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:01.440
And the answer to that is it is freaking difficult.

317
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:06.210
It is just really difficult to do because we've got a media that ignores stuff.

318
00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.660
We've got a media that pushes stuff, and it's all dependent on,

319
00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.930
on who's in power. As I talked about with the previous story, uh,

320
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:15.000
but speaking of our mainstream media,

321
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:18.720
I saw this video this morning on MSNBC.

322
00:18:18.721 --> 00:18:22.440
This just went viral about an hour ago. And I, I said to my producer, Michael,

323
00:18:22.441 --> 00:18:23.190
this morning, you know, I don't,

324
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.490
I don't want to just drop everybody with politics today. You guys know,

325
00:18:26.491 --> 00:18:27.810
I try not to do that in general,

326
00:18:27.811 --> 00:18:31.470
but I wanted to find something like a little more lighthearted or silly or beat

327
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:35.760
or whatever. Now this is MSNBC. So it is sort of political,

328
00:18:35.761 --> 00:18:40.050
but I think you're going to see why I thought this clip would be just right to

329
00:18:40.051 --> 00:18:43.620
end the show today. This is MSNBC. This is Craig.

330
00:18:43.621 --> 00:18:45.150
Melvin is a,

331
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:49.680
is interviewing a reporter by the name of Ken

332
00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.890
Delania. And, uh, well, take a look.

333
00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:57.470
<v 3>As some new reporting on something that we talked about at the top of the hour,</v>

334
00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:02.420
how the Trump administration is handling the transition with the incoming

335
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:05.030
Biden team or not handling. It was,

336
00:19:05.031 --> 00:19:09.830
should say to a certain extent this time it involves our intelligence community.

337
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.770
Uh, Ken, what have you learned, sir? Oh.

338
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:23.390
Okay. Uh, think we lost. I think we lost kid for a second. We'll try it.

339
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:28.723
<v 1>Oh,</v>

340
00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:35.360
the media just became self-aware you see that? Ken, Ken,

341
00:19:35.361 --> 00:19:38.840
what have you learned about this thing that we're constantly talking about?

342
00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.033
What was the.

343
00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.560
Um, I don't know exactly what happened there and I'm gonna,

344
00:19:48.561 --> 00:19:51.020
I don't know who Ken is. I've never seen Ken before,

345
00:19:51.021 --> 00:19:55.250
but I'm going to give Ken the benefit of the doubt that maybe something weird

346
00:19:55.251 --> 00:19:56.450
happened with his IFB.

347
00:19:56.451 --> 00:19:59.990
That's the little thing that you put in your ear so that you can actually hear

348
00:19:59.991 --> 00:20:01.910
the feed. Like I have it in my ear right now,

349
00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.730
not so that someone can tell me what to say or anything like that,

350
00:20:04.731 --> 00:20:06.350
but it's so that I can hear the clip. Right.

351
00:20:06.351 --> 00:20:09.860
So I could hear that MSNBC clip because we can't play it through my speakers in

352
00:20:09.861 --> 00:20:13.100
here because I've got a microphone on and it causes reverb and a whole bunch of

353
00:20:13.101 --> 00:20:13.700
other things.

354
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.090
So I'm going to guess that maybe something happened some weird crackling or

355
00:20:17.091 --> 00:20:21.710
something. Uh, but there's just something sort of beautiful about like,

356
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:25.400
you know, watching Craig Melvin's, you know, in effect like,

357
00:20:25.401 --> 00:20:27.800
so when we don't know what the hell is going on,

358
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:31.940
Trump may acknowledge something may not acknowledge. Oh.

359
00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:37.520
Like, it's just perfect. And there's also something about, you know,

360
00:20:37.521 --> 00:20:42.350
I talked about this a lot about like seeing these mainstream media

361
00:20:42.351 --> 00:20:45.950
people that in fact they are human, you know,

362
00:20:45.951 --> 00:20:50.860
you only see them in little box. Right. And they act very serious all the time.

363
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.910
And th you know, they're very self-righteous and very moral and, you know,

364
00:20:54.911 --> 00:20:58.030
they've got their, their glasses and the rest of it.

365
00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:03.430
And yet the truth is that they are people, you know, but,

366
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:07.630
uh, [inaudible] breaking news. Virta, it's like,

367
00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:12.540
I think that's why so many people are just tuning out of this because the

368
00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:16.090
act we've, we've sort of seen through the act, you know what I mean?

369
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:20.380
We've pulled the curtain aside and it's not the great wizard of Oz. It's just,

370
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:24.520
you know, this little guy, this little nervous scientists like that,

371
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:28.690
that's sort of where we're at with everything right now. So it's just, it's,

372
00:21:28.691 --> 00:21:31.000
you know what, let's play the clip again. Can we, Connor,

373
00:21:31.001 --> 00:21:35.260
can we get that thing going again? I, I need to see it one more time. I said,

374
00:21:35.261 --> 00:21:37.960
I've got a busy day today, but I feel like this will set me up. Right?

375
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.440
So let's throw to the clip one more time.

376
00:21:41.441 --> 00:21:45.730
This is Ken Delaney and responding to Craig Melvin

377
00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.800
on Ms. NBC.

378
00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:52.380
<v 3>Has some new reporting on something that we talked about at the top of the hour,</v>

379
00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:57.300
how the Trump administration is handling the transition with the incoming

380
00:21:57.301 --> 00:21:59.760
Biden team or not handling it.

381
00:21:59.761 --> 00:22:04.230
We should say to a certain extent this time it involves our intelligence

382
00:22:04.231 --> 00:22:06.510
community. Uh, Ken, what have you learned, sir?

383
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:08.333
<v 0>Oh.</v>

384
00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.650
<v 3>Okay. Uh, I think we lost.</v>

385
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.700
<v 1>I mean, the way that Craig ocean, you know, okay.</v>

386
00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:27.450
I think we lost Ken or Ken or whatever. I like this though. Oh.

387
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.550
That should be, that should be an MSNBC show. You know what I mean?

388
00:22:32.551 --> 00:22:36.450
Like right after your bad out, you know, and then she has to like, you know,

389
00:22:36.451 --> 00:22:40.410
give them the transition into, Oh. So, you know, she's babbling to the camera.

390
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:44.220
Russia, Russia, Russia, Trump, Trump, Trump coming up next on. Oh.

391
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:49.890
We're screwed everybody. I think that would actually be, I would watch MSNBC,

392
00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:53.010
if that would happen. I would watch MSNBC. All right. People,
