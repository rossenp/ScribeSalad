00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.810
<v 0>What's happened to LA it kind of, I,</v>

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.040
I always thought of LA and even California,

3
00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:12.720
for sure as kind of that hot blonde from high school,

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.180
that was always the Belle of the ball.

5
00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:19.740
Didn't have to study very hard phone rang every Friday night for a date really

6
00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:22.800
was able to kind of get by in her looks and kind of cruise.

7
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.290
And now that blonde is 47 years old and not the bell of the ball

8
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:32.670
anymore. And you know, if you listen to Gavin Newsome that guy,

9
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.520
I've heard interviews with him going, Hey man, where are you going to go?

10
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:40.350
It's like, it's like the 47 year old blonde saying to the football star.

11
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:43.890
Hey, don't you want some of this? And it's like, no, nah,

12
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.210
I can find some of that in Texas or Arizona or Nevada

13
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.970
[inaudible].

14
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.590
<v 1>Hey Rubin. And this is the Rubin report.</v>

15
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.050
Joining me today is a best-selling author,

16
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.900
CoStar of the wonderful documentary,

17
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.040
no safe spaces and host of the Adam Carolla show podcast,

18
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.560
Adam Corolla. Welcome back to the Rubin report.

19
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.380
<v 0>Always good to be back, Dave. All.</v>

20
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.131
<v 1>Right, Corolla.</v>

21
00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:17.960
We got a lot to do here because this is my last interview

22
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.760
of 2020. And we said, who can we get on the show to end the year?

23
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:27.500
That is not completely bananas. And you were on the shortlist.

24
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:30.860
There were only about two other people and we couldn't get them. So we got you.

25
00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:34.490
You're on the shortlist of Dave Rubin, sane people. How does that make you feel?

26
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.050
<v 0>You know, when I write my next autobiography,</v>

27
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.730
it's going to be titled from the short bus to the short list.

28
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.600
The Adam Carolla story. Nice to be on the short list. Yeah.

29
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.030
<v 1>You, you have done it, my friend. All right. First off,</v>

30
00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:54.800
I got to ask you something because there is a rumor going around town. My guys,

31
00:01:54.801 --> 00:01:59.150
my team seemed to believe this rumor that you're moving to Texas. Now,

32
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.780
when I talk about shortlist on my short list of LA people,

33
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.340
I got Adam Corolla. I got Dennis Prager. I got Larry elder,

34
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.170
John Voight. That's it. Are you, are you leaving us? You're going to Houston.

35
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.970
<v 0>No, not just yet. I did a hit on Tucker Carlson, uh,</v>

36
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.200
I guess last week.

37
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.180
And they brought the van to my house and a

38
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.800
Tucker always does the, when you leave in LA. And I think he, he grew up in,

39
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.780
I think LA and San Diego. So a lot of the guys and,

40
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.910
uh, him and Shapiro are the two when he leave in LA guys because they were in LA

41
00:02:37.911 --> 00:02:42.830
and they, they left and I've always been in LA. So just off the cuff,

42
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.600
because we're in this van, that was a satellite van. I just,

43
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.880
as an improvisational comedian, I just said, Oh, Tucker's hits over.

44
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:56.240
I'm going to commandeer this van. And I'm driving to Houston.

45
00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.430
And for some reason that didn't come across as joke to a lot of people,

46
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:02.440
but you should have seen that.

47
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:07.000
It was a joke people because if I was going to Houston,

48
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.390
I would certainly do it on a Southwest flight. I don't think I'm commandeer

49
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.000
$50,000.

50
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.160
<v 1>Wouldn't take the satellite van from Fox news and drive that all the way to</v>

51
00:03:17.161 --> 00:03:20.490
Texas. You, you do it. First-class on Southwest. I get it.

52
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.240
<v 0>I feel like just from a mileage standpoint,</v>

53
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.180
it would cost much more to take that satellite van.

54
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.860
<v 1>All right. So I'm glad to hear it sounds like you're staying for a little bit,</v>

55
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.950
but I did have you over for dinner a couple of months ago.

56
00:03:34.951 --> 00:03:39.540
And you said you were on a three year plan and we're watching Cali

57
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.500
just fall apart. I'm a, I'm a native new Yorker, but I've been here seven years.

58
00:03:43.501 --> 00:03:47.490
You're you're from so Calvin, what the high hell is going on here.

59
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.130
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

60
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.820
My kids are just getting into high school if you want to call it getting into

61
00:03:53.821 --> 00:03:54.654
high school.

62
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.050
Cause I walked into both their bedrooms this morning and they're both laying in

63
00:03:58.051 --> 00:04:01.560
bed with their covers over them. And I went, Hey, I thought it was school time.

64
00:04:01.561 --> 00:04:06.360
And we're on the zoom class from underneath the comforter.

65
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.300
Um, you know, what's happened to LA it kind of,

66
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.920
I, I always thought of LA and even California,

67
00:04:16.921 --> 00:04:21.600
for sure as kind of that hot blonde from high school,

68
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.060
that was always the Belle of the ball.

69
00:04:24.061 --> 00:04:28.620
Didn't have to study very hard phone rang every Friday night for a date really

70
00:04:28.621 --> 00:04:31.680
was able to kind of get by in or looks and kind of cruise.

71
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.170
And now that blonde is 47 years old and not the Belle of the ball

72
00:04:37.171 --> 00:04:41.550
anymore. And you know, if you listen to Gavin Newsome that guy,

73
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.400
I've heard interviews with him going, Hey man, where are you going to go?

74
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.230
It's like, it's like the 47 year old blonde saying to the, the football star.

75
00:04:49.231 --> 00:04:52.770
Hey don't you want some of this? And it's like, no, nah,

76
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.840
I can find some of that in Texas or Arizona or Nevada or

77
00:04:57.841 --> 00:05:02.070
Nashville, Tennessee or whatever. But there's a kind of a thing where it's like,

78
00:05:02.071 --> 00:05:06.570
when you're used to being the Belle of the ball, you don't study that hard.

79
00:05:06.571 --> 00:05:10.680
You don't try that hard. I mean, California was always like, we got the beaches,

80
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.040
we got the mountains, we got, uh, all we got Disneyland,

81
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.050
we got all this great stuff. So it's like, well,

82
00:05:16.051 --> 00:05:20.250
what about how hospitable you are to business? Well, don't worry about that.

83
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.930
We got Malibu, right.

84
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.070
And what they didn't really factor on. I mean,

85
00:05:26.071 --> 00:05:30.780
there's a few things first off smart people don't want to just hang

86
00:05:30.781 --> 00:05:35.100
out and be essentially abused by their government. That's that's number one,

87
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.460
number two. There's a part of it. That's just practical.

88
00:05:38.461 --> 00:05:42.420
Like I grew up out here, my parents,

89
00:05:42.421 --> 00:05:47.190
my mom had a VW square back. She had like a seventies VW station wagon.

90
00:05:47.191 --> 00:05:51.870
My dad drove a VW bug. Forget about driving to Arizona.

91
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.760
We couldn't get to van IES from North Hollywood without the thing vapor.

92
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:00.230
And like I talked to a friend of mine,

93
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:04.310
a Dickey from the Bosstones the lead singer from the band, the Bosstones.

94
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.130
And he was like, yeah, I moved to Arizona and I'm like, Oh, you got to go.

95
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.880
It's like the drive's not bad. I got a great car. It's it's,

96
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.680
it's got Y you know, it's, it's got Sirius XM and uh, in, uh,

97
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.040
a heater in the seat. And it's like, it's, it's not that big though.

98
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.910
Like physically the transportation, you know, the,

99
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.220
the 10 flights a day that are going from Burbank to Phoenix or jet

100
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:32.960
suite X, you know, like you can get to salt Lake city and, uh, 55 minutes,

101
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:37.610
like there's a F there's a kind of tangible mechanical part of this,

102
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.760
which is when I was a kid. If you wanted to move,

103
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:44.510
like buying a ticket on an airline was a big deal.

104
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:46.820
Like packing up a rider, crock again,

105
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.710
physically didn't have cars that could make it, you know, it's,

106
00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:52.490
it's all kind of doable now.

107
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.650
<v 1>So, so what do you think the future of this town is?</v>

108
00:06:56.651 --> 00:07:00.670
I think you probably have a couple Hollywood friends that still talk to you.

109
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.720
I've got one or two that would not be happy if I mentioned their name. Um,

110
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.490
but do you think that this town is just now condemned between Garcetti

111
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.730
at the, at the city level and Newsome at the state level?

112
00:07:12.731 --> 00:07:16.870
Do you think we are just truly condemned and now gas gone this new da.

113
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.250
Who's not going to arrest people for prostitution or resisting arrest or a

114
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:24.820
series of other things. Like how much worse can it get, do you think?

115
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:31.630
<v 0>Well, maybe just a little bit. And then maybe it's time. Like, you know,</v>

116
00:07:31.631 --> 00:07:36.070
like a horrible alcoholic, maybe this is the I've stolen.

117
00:07:36.071 --> 00:07:40.060
My kids' piggy bank. I'm going to break it open to buy some malt liquor.

118
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:44.830
And I now catch a glance of myself in the mirror and I've hit rock

119
00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:49.270
bottom. Maybe that see you in the mirror thing. Maybe we're there.

120
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:50.620
I was thinking about guests,

121
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.880
Don it's like loitering is not going to be a problem. Trespassing,

122
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.830
not going to be a problem, underage drinking.

123
00:07:56.831 --> 00:07:59.590
It's not going to be a prom prostitution. It's not going to be a problem.

124
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.350
And I thought, where the was this guy? When I was, yeah.

125
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.110
<v 1>I could have really used this da when I was in high.</v>

126
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:11.560
Not only that you can steal up to $900. That's what they're telling you.

127
00:08:11.561 --> 00:08:15.700
You can do. So you could steal a PlayStation five and like seven games,

128
00:08:15.701 --> 00:08:18.070
but you go into the eight game range now you're in trouble.

129
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.830
<v 0>Yeah. It all seems like a very eerie harbinger,</v>

130
00:08:23.831 --> 00:08:28.360
but I hear you. You brought up Hollywood like our Hollywood friends.

131
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:34.120
Um, if you think about this, uh, Los Angeles,

132
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.590
Hollywood, LA always been the sort of hub of production.

133
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.680
Right. And everything was filmed. Everything.

134
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:46.510
Every TV show anyone ever saw around the world was filmed and, you know,

135
00:08:46.511 --> 00:08:51.250
Burbank or Culver city or, uh, somewhere in Hollywood.

136
00:08:51.251 --> 00:08:53.110
I mean, I've been on all those,

137
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:58.290
all the I've been all the I've been all the lots I used to be at Hollywood

138
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:02.040
center studios doing the man show. And we did crank anchors there.

139
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:03.180
I did Loveline there.

140
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.650
And at a certain point they started getting greedy.

141
00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:10.680
They started over-regulating. This started over taxing.

142
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:14.370
And so what did the most liberal people on the planet do?

143
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:16.770
They started drifting into Atlanta.

144
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:20.400
They started going to Canada start going to Prague. I mean,

145
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.790
they literally just left. So it was called runaway production.

146
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.800
And at some point,

147
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:30.780
some semi Schober person thought we can't just have all of this money just

148
00:09:30.781 --> 00:09:34.980
physically leaving the state. And they course corrected a little bit.

149
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:39.330
They were like, well, why don't we offer some incentives for these businesses,

150
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.470
Hollywood, not to leave the state to do all as,

151
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.950
as I've probably told your audience. Um,

152
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:51.990
I drove from this studio where I'm sitting right

153
00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:56.910
now. Uh, Bryan Cranston came in and did the show. Brian's a good guy,

154
00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:01.770
probably one of the more liberal guys in Hollywood. And, uh, he said like,

155
00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.460
I got to catch an Uber to Burbank, to the Burbank airport. And I said,

156
00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:08.190
I'll drive to the Burbank airport. It's four miles away.

157
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.060
Then we jumped in my car and while we were driving there,
