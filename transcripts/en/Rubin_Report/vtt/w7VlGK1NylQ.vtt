WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.120
<v 0>I think it's been remarkable, um,</v>

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.370
to have this level of panic, uh, you know, governor Newsome, uh,

3
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:10.740
for example, closed the zoos again. Now,

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.110
if you're going to lock up every poor child in Los Angeles or San Diego or

5
00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:20.070
San Francisco, so that they're, they're in a little apartment, uh,

6
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:23.850
they have no space and then you're going to close all the public parks.

7
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.640
Uh, what are these little kids supposed to do? And,

8
00:00:27.641 --> 00:00:31.950
and it strikes me that what you end up with is a public health

9
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.180
dictatorship, which is very singular and how it measures things.

10
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.970
Uh, I had a university president say to me the other day that he will lose more

11
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:46.890
young people to suicide and drunk driving than he will lose to COVID.

12
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.150
And he said, they're reopening.

13
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.530
He cannot understand why people have any doubt at all about reopening.

14
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.850
<v 1>I'm Dave Rubin. And this is the Rubin report,</v>

15
00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:05.510
reminder everybody to subscribe to our YouTube channel and click that pesky

16
00:01:05.511 --> 00:01:10.010
notification bell. And joining me today is the former speaker of the house,

17
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.450
the author of over 40 books and the chairman of Gingrich three 60

18
00:01:14.451 --> 00:01:16.880
consulting, new Gingrich, welcome to the Rubin report.

19
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.400
<v 0>No, it's good to be with you. Exciting.</v>

20
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.110
<v 1>I'm glad to have you. You are in Rome at the moment.</v>

21
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.390
What's what's going on in Rome these days.

22
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.860
<v 0>Well, as you know, my wife Calista is the ambassador to the Vatican.</v>

23
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.720
So that's why we're here. Rome actually is at a huge comeback. They, uh,

24
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.740
got in a big trouble back in, uh, February,

25
00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:44.540
because there are about a hundred thousand Chinese workers in Northern

26
00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:49.400
Italy and they were not allowing the flights to continue.

27
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.230
So they were literally flying in for Wu Han bringing the disease right here.

28
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.270
And it got so out of control that their hospital system was breaking down

29
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.390
and they were starting to triage people on the fewer, over 80.

30
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.620
They basically said, you're not getting, we're not gonna take care of you. Um,

31
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.570
he, in fact, Calista helped, uh, Samaritan's purse, uh,

32
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.640
Franklin Graham's operation. They flew in an entire hospital, uh, 68 beds,

33
00:02:16.641 --> 00:02:20.360
60 doctors and nurses into the worst hip part of Northern Italy.

34
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.780
So the Italian government closed everything down. Uh,

35
00:02:23.781 --> 00:02:27.710
we had grocery stores, uh, pharmacies,

36
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.140
gas stations. That's it. If you were in the street,

37
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.040
uh, you had to have a good excuse in writing,

38
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.710
or you could be fined 3000, $200. So for 10 weeks,

39
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.840
Kilian cluster ran the embassy from our house Verde virtually,

40
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.830
and we do amazing amount of zoom and go to meeting. And what have you,

41
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.920
and a pretend weeks,

42
00:02:54.921 --> 00:02:58.550
they basically starved the virus and gradually got it under control.

43
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.310
It's now sufficiently under control that they've reopened the restaurants,

44
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:08.110
the museums, uh, public parks, uh, stores.

45
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.460
And you see people walking around now,

46
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.540
problem Italy is about 14% of the economy.

47
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.190
$137 is tourism, and they don't have any tourism yet.

48
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.890
So places like the Colosseum,

49
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.700
the last year got 23,000 people a day. You know,

50
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.010
they maybe have 500 or a thousand a day.

51
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.230
That's a real economic crisis for them. But, but, but in terms of the,

52
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.700
uh, pandemic, they are in dramatically, dramatically better shape today.

53
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.950
<v 1>Yeah. So we're holding this interview for a couple of days.</v>

54
00:03:43.951 --> 00:03:47.670
So I don't want to ask you anything about specifically what's happening today,

55
00:03:47.671 --> 00:03:52.440
but, but generally speaking the way you see the lockdown now in

56
00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:56.640
America, and I'm here in Los Angeles and literally just yesterday,

57
00:03:56.641 --> 00:03:57.474
Newsome put us,

58
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.380
put us in another lockdown and that these things seem to keep continually

59
00:04:01.381 --> 00:04:04.120
happening. We're watching some spikes, you know, it,

60
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:08.250
it just seems that no one knows who to trust at the moment. Uh,

61
00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:12.090
what's your take about how the States have done it, where,

62
00:04:12.091 --> 00:04:13.770
where Trump fits into this.

63
00:04:13.771 --> 00:04:17.790
And is there something that you would have been doing differently as speaker of

64
00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:22.110
the house to, to push your guys, to push certain things, uh, differently?

65
00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.950
<v 0>I think it's been remarkable, um,</v>

66
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.770
to have this level of panic, uh, you know, governor Newsome, uh, for example,

67
00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.570
closed the zoos again. Now,

68
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.940
if you're going to lock up every poor child in Los Angeles or San Diego or

69
00:04:38.941 --> 00:04:42.900
San Francisco, so that they're, they're in a little apartment, uh,

70
00:04:42.901 --> 00:04:46.680
they have no space and then you're going to close all the public parks.

71
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.500
Uh, what are these little kids supposed to do? And,

72
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.780
and it strikes me that what you end up with is a public health

73
00:04:54.781 --> 00:04:59.010
dictatorship, which is very singular and how it measures things.

74
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.800
Uh, I had a university president say to me the other day that he will lose more

75
00:05:04.801 --> 00:05:09.720
young people to suicide and drunk driving. Then he will lose to COVID.

76
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.980
And he said, they're reopening.

77
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.390
He cannot understand why people have any doubt at all about reopening.

78
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.520
And so I would start from there.

79
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.500
The people you need to worry about half of all the deaths are people who are

80
00:05:25.501 --> 00:05:28.680
over 70 years of age and in particular, he go,

81
00:05:28.681 --> 00:05:31.770
the more you go up at 80 years of it's more dangerous at 90,

82
00:05:31.771 --> 00:05:32.910
it's even more dangerous.

83
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.040
So you know that you want to really work to protect people who are over

84
00:05:38.041 --> 00:05:42.210
70 quite. You don't need to really work to protect people who are 13.

85
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.520
Uh, and the idea that we're,

86
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.420
we we've gone from a country that used to know how to open one house, uh,

87
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.390
school rooms and have seven classes in one room.

88
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.520
And people actually learn how to read to an extraordinarily expensive union

89
00:05:56.521 --> 00:05:59.300
dominated bureaucracy that doesn't want to teach.

90
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.960
And you're gonna have this in Los Angeles. They've got it in New York. I mean,

91
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.150
they have a Fairfax County, Virginia,

92
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:07.970
one of the biggest and richest school districts in the country.

93
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.080
Why would we pay people to not teach, uh,

94
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.190
why wouldn't we have all these big fancy buildings nobody can go to. And, uh,

95
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.780
I think it really raises very profound questions about the whole system.

96
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.391
<v 1>Yeah, well,</v>

97
00:06:22.391 --> 00:06:25.330
that actually is perfect segue because I was going to say as someone that's a

98
00:06:25.331 --> 00:06:28.300
true lover of American history and has written about it,

99
00:06:28.301 --> 00:06:30.040
and you talk about American history all the time,

100
00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:35.110
are you sort of shocked the way the average American person just sort of takes

101
00:06:35.111 --> 00:06:39.640
orders and doesn't necessarily ask why are these things

102
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.370
happening? You know, at one time it was flattened the curve.

103
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.250
We don't hear the phrase flatten the curve anymore. We haven't heard it.

104
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.480
Excuse me for about six weeks now it seems to be something else or they just

105
00:06:49.481 --> 00:06:51.790
give us an order and they don't really tell you.

106
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.910
<v 0>Why. Well, I mean, part of it has been,</v>

107
00:06:54.911 --> 00:06:59.500
I think the evolution from a news media to a

108
00:06:59.501 --> 00:07:04.060
propaganda media, so that you have these waves of coverage, uh,

109
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.260
I compared it to, uh, watching the fledge Alante in the middle ages,

110
00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:11.560
this was a group that would go from city to city beating themselves.

111
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:17.200
And so you have all of these people out here who they panic. Um,

112
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.640
now the truth is, if you look at the death rate, there was no reason to panic.

113
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.370
Uh, this is not the bubonic plague. It's, it's not Ebola.

114
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:33.160
Uh, most people who get, first of all, an amazing percentage who get the,

115
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.390
um, the, the, by the Chinese virus, which is what it is.

116
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.140
Most of them don't even know. They have it. Um,

117
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.980
when you're as old, somebody tested positive who was quote asymptomatic,

118
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:52.720
that means whatever symptoms they had were so mild that

119
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.890
it didn't affect them. So you have to stop and say, wait a second,

120
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.450
why are we panicking over people? You know,

121
00:08:01.451 --> 00:08:02.890
the numbers go up with the numbers,

122
00:08:02.891 --> 00:08:07.450
go up with people under 35 who are totally healthy. Uh,

123
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.710
and I think the, I, I have been truly appalled by my younger daughter,

124
00:08:11.711 --> 00:08:16.600
J bushland as a certified financial analyst and used to run a very large budget,

125
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.700
billion dollar plus budget.

126
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.930
And she said to me that night and just sheer discussed, she said,

127
00:08:22.931 --> 00:08:27.910
I have never seen statistics put together so badly that it is

128
00:08:27.911 --> 00:08:29.890
impossible to know what's actually happening.

129
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.280
