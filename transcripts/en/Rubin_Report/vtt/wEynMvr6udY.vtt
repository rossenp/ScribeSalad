1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.960
<v 0>I gave Biden money because when he went in front of these coal miners and told</v>

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.780
them that I know how to shovel coal, you can learn how to program a computer.

3
00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:10.050
I'm like, I need a year of this. He literally did the learn to code me.

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.420
<v 2>Finding that there is an undercurrent of support for Trump.</v>

5
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.920
Now that did not exist last time that suddenly this thing has gone. So bananas,

6
00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:23.570
everything we've been talking about for this half hour,

7
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.560
that now there's people that would have never considered voting for Trump.

8
00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:31.400
The first time that basically still see the wheels on the machines still see

9
00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:33.080
some level of pride in America,

10
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.540
still see paychecks that are working on unemployment.

11
00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:38.120
That's low in black unemployment. That's low in Hispanic, unemployment that low.

12
00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:40.790
And they like getting rid of some of the regulation and all of those things that

13
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.750
were not an extra Wars.

14
00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:44.960
And he's trying to get us out of Afghanistan and everything else that suddenly

15
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:48.050
people that would have been completely, um,

16
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.150
in opposition to Trump last time.

17
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.590
<v 0>I think a lot of their,</v>

18
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.960
I think a lot of them are just going to be happy to stay home.

19
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.470
They're going to be like, look, I can't bring myself to vote for this guy. He's,

20
00:00:57.471 --> 00:01:02.450
you know, we can think of all the names, but I'm not going to endorse this. Uh,

21
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.100
especially if Biden is the nominee,

22
00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:07.940
I gave Biden money because when he went in front of these coal miners and tell

23
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.820
them, I know how to shovel coal, you can learn how to program a computer.

24
00:01:10.821 --> 00:01:12.080
I'm like, I need a year of this.

25
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.920
<v 2>We literally did the learn to code me. I mean, for those people then,</v>

26
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.400
for people that know about this meeting, this was a meme that when, what was it?

27
00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:22.070
Was it Buzzfeed when Buzzfeed was going to use basically.

28
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.460
<v 0>Laid off a lot of journalists and, and they're all boo-hooing. Um,</v>

29
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.670
and then all the trolls and the, I use the word trolls in the good sense,

30
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:32.510
just added them hashtag learn to code. And people got kicked off.

31
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.670
<v 2>Twitter, meaning learn how to do something productive.</v>

32
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.450
Instead of being a Buzzfeed and bright and Biden actually brought it to life.

33
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.190
<v 0>He also brought to life. It's an audience where it's not accurate, right? It is.</v>

34
00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:43.640
If you know how to write from Buzzfeed,

35
00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:46.400
you could probably have the technical skills to learn how to code on a basic

36
00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:49.220
level. If you're a coal miner that does not mean,

37
00:01:49.221 --> 00:01:51.680
you know how to use a computer, well, this is not. And by the way,

38
00:01:51.681 --> 00:01:54.050
if you're a computer programmer, you can't mind coal either.

39
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.790
These do not transition very easily. So, uh,

40
00:01:57.791 --> 00:02:01.550
I think it was comfortably smug who tweeted out that you do know if there's the

41
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:02.384
debates.

42
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.810
Trump is going to bring that stripper and put her in the front row and ask Joe,

43
00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:08.510
if he's met his granddaughter and it's going to be just complete chaos.

44
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:13.040
So I hope he's the nominee very desperately, but watching.

45
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.930
<v 2>Him is sort of depressing. Right? I know. So I know this is where you wouldn't,</v>

46
00:02:17.931 --> 00:02:20.180
it's depressing in that for,

47
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.440
for someone that's a little more old school politics and not on the fringe of

48
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:27.020
the new, right. But for someone that like, you know,

49
00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:31.400
I want the system to somehow function, even though I always tell you, it's like,

50
00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:34.340
I love all the intellectual adventures. I go under the you, I really do.

51
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.310
But for someone that wants like some thing to kind of hold,

52
00:02:37.311 --> 00:02:40.880
that was somewhat centrist. And we could have an interesting, no,

53
00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:43.220
but he can't do it anymore. It seems like he can't do it.

54
00:02:43.221 --> 00:02:45.140
Which is why he's telling these guys to code.

55
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.800
It's why he's saying you can pick your gender depending on which jail you want

56
00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:51.740
to go to. Yeah. And you didn't at the equality forum.

57
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.460
It's not what birth sex you are.

58
00:02:55.461 --> 00:02:58.400
It's what you identify as you're gonna have an awful lot of male rapists in

59
00:02:58.401 --> 00:02:59.234
women's prisons.

60
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.120
He literally said that he was brought in as the same guy and he can't be sane.

61
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.060
But I think that gets to your point that this thing just eats through

62
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.990
everything.

63
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.780
<v 0>Yeah. Right. And I, he, again, he doesn't have that space within his party. Uh,</v>

64
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.630
I can't believe he said that about the jails. I mean, this is hilarious.

65
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.570
<v 2>I am not making it up. How are you, how are you.</v>

66
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.220
<v 0>Not, how is this depressing to you? This is glorious. I can just.</v>

67
00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.360
<v 2>You know what I'm telling my guys right now,</v>

68
00:03:24.361 --> 00:03:25.380
we're going to we'll play the clip right.

69
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.543
<v 3>In prison.</v>

70
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.380
The determination should be that your sexual identity is

71
00:03:31.381 --> 00:03:36.150
defined by what you say. It is not what in fact the prison says it is.

72
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.190
And in that case, you should be entitled also to OGB wine. Anyway,

73
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.970
you didn't ask that question because you're not likely to either.

74
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.020
<v 2>Well, there you go, malice.</v>

75
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.600
That's the man that you want to be the democratic candidate for press.

76
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.340
<v 0>Desperately. Um,</v>

77
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.910
one of the things that this speaks to is one of the best aspects of

78
00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:57.450
conservatism, which is asking questions, like, what do you,

79
00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.010
when you're advocating for program,

80
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.720
what do you do with the people who use this program in bad faith or this law in

81
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:04.530
bad faith.

82
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.040
And very often people on the left don't have an answer or they'll hand wave it

83
00:04:08.041 --> 00:04:11.490
away. Like, Oh, there won't be that many cases. Well, that don't, we,

84
00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:15.060
that many cases again is Nicholas Cruz in Florida shooting up a school.

85
00:04:15.061 --> 00:04:19.380
It's that outlier that both moves culture and also is the destroyer.

86
00:04:19.381 --> 00:04:21.510
And that is who we should be concerned about.

87
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.760
<v 2>What else are you tracking right now? Um, what,</v>

88
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:28.980
what else is on your mind out of the th that's unearthed in the bottom of the.

89
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.740
<v 0>Well, I've been, so I've been engaging in like PSYOPs with a lot of these types.</v>

90
00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:37.950
So for example, when you're working on a campaign,

91
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.740
you're going to have tunnel vision bunk. You're going,

92
00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.860
you're living in a bunker, right?

93
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.670
So when there's an article that comes out in the New York times, everyone,

94
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.920
that campaign is freaking out, how is this going to play?

95
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.040
How the other campaigns you, you kind of have, it's like, Plato's cave,

96
00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:51.000
very limited information.

97
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.690
So what I do is I have a bigger Twitter following than many of these campaign

98
00:04:54.691 --> 00:04:56.070
managers for these candidates.

99
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.830
So instead people tweet like nasty things at them.

100
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.820
That'll strengthen their resolve. If you're saying, Oh, Warren's this and that,

101
00:05:02.821 --> 00:05:06.780
it's like, yeah, I'm fighting for her against you. So I will be like, Hey,

102
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.020
at Roger Lau, latest polls came out from Iowa.

103
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.740
Five of the six candidates have solidified their support.

104
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.620
Only Warren has lost support.

105
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.670
How depressed are you at the campaign on a scale of one's Anthony Bordain.

106
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.670
And then that gets retweeted. And you know,

107
00:05:23.671 --> 00:05:27.810
it's filling up as notifications and he's already having a bad day and now he's

108
00:05:27.811 --> 00:05:29.250
going to be freaking out even more, hopefully.

109
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.500
<v 2>So you're, instead of killing them with, uh, attacks, it's not quite kindness,</v>

110
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.960
you're killing them, but you're killing. You're killing them with sarcasm.

111
00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:37.380
Basically.

112
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.210
<v 0>Sarcasm is a sincere question. I mean, I'm,</v>

113
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.010
I'm giving the devil on their left shoulder steroids and being like more

114
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:48.870
insecurity, more fear, more freaking out and just ginning up that kind of,

115
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:49.763
I mean,

116
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.480
I can't imagine working in campaign is in a state of constant stress and panic,

117
00:05:54.481 --> 00:05:58.130
and you're putting out fires all the time. So let's add some and watch it burn.

118
00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.730
How.

119
00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.690
<v 2>Concerned are you that the,</v>

120
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.010
at the social media level and at the big tech level that the game has been so

121
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:06.800
rigged and manipulated already that we have no idea what's going on. I,

122
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:08.840
you know, I keep mentioning this thing about, uh,

123
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.300
shadow banning is now in Twitter's terms of service,

124
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.430
they can literally throttle accounts. We've,

125
00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:15.620
we've known that they've been doing it forever,

126
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:18.380
but now they're telling us they're doing it as of January 1st.

127
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:21.860
And we all just keep playing the game as if the game is not being.

128
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.980
<v 0>But the game is always going to be rigged. I mean,</v>

129
00:06:23.981 --> 00:06:27.040
when you have your enemies to expect them to play fair is extremely naive.

130
00:06:27.041 --> 00:06:29.260
This is my Soviet mindset talking. Uh,

131
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.720
we did have a president who tweeted his way into the white house.

132
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.430
And I think what people don't appreciate is the existential angst.

133
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.410
It causes someone who works at a social media company to see their product or

134
00:06:41.411 --> 00:06:43.750
their program being from their perspective,

135
00:06:43.751 --> 00:06:47.350
subverted by those who they despise to further their agenda.

136
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.600
This must cause them a lot of grief.

137
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.360
<v 2>But doesn't, it also cause them to, you know,</v>

138
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.720
tighten those spickets and make sure that as we get closer to the election,

139
00:06:55.721 --> 00:06:57.580
that Michael malice isn't going to be heard as much,

140
00:06:57.581 --> 00:07:01.000
or Trump's not going to be heard as much or, or Ruben or anybody else. I mean,

141
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.240
sure. I mean, th the thing we all pretend that that's not really, it,

142
00:07:04.241 --> 00:07:07.090
like that would be the thing that we would all be relentlessly talking about.

143
00:07:07.091 --> 00:07:09.880
Right. If we really were trying to change something here.

144
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.950
<v 0>I think they are losing tools in their toolbox. Uh, and I think, I mean,</v>

145
00:07:14.951 --> 00:07:18.190
you know, Kamala Harris was calling for Trump to be banned from Twitter,

146
00:07:18.191 --> 00:07:20.770
remember this? And she got pushed back even from the left.

147
00:07:20.771 --> 00:07:25.330
And when she lost her campaign, I did a ham tasting on my live stream.

148
00:07:25.331 --> 00:07:26.380
And we tried, you know,

149
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.690
different kinds of hams from all over the world because the pig was finally

150
00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:33.280
roasted. So I think they are going to try different tactics,

151
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.150
but because they're being called out on their tactics,

152
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.320
instead of being called out on the issues, this is why they're freaking out.

153
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.090
It used to be, they would say,

154
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.540
Dave Rubin's are racist and you would spend months being of, no, I'm not, no,

155
00:07:46.541 --> 00:07:49.030
I'm not. Now it's Dave Rubin saying,

156
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:53.860
look at their technique of calling me, Rogan, everybody else,

157
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.440
a racist as a means of preemptively dismissing them.

158
00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:01.600
So by you calling out their technique, it loses almost all its efficacy.

159
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.820
<v 2>You know, it's funny because like three years ago,</v>

160
00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:08.320
let's say when daily beast or mother Jones or any of these awful things,

161
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.900
these, these G what do you call it? You call them jihadist.

162
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.850
<v 0>Jihadis without the testosterone. Yes.</v>

163
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:15.250
<v 2>Whenever they were doing that. And they would call me all these things,</v>

164
00:08:15.251 --> 00:08:17.080
you know, I'd, I'd fight back. And then, you know,

165
00:08:17.081 --> 00:08:19.600
I could occasionally get them to change one line or whatever,

166
00:08:19.601 --> 00:08:21.940
but then they wouldn't, they wouldn't actually retweet the thing.

167
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.790
They would just change it and nobody's seen it and whatever it's out there,

168
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.070
it's out there for then right. Stealth edit.

169
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.890
So then Wikipedia can grab from it and right. And the rest of it.

170
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.740
But it used to really upset me, obviously when I first, you know,

171
00:08:32.741 --> 00:08:34.520
like anyone that starts getting that heat, it,

172
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.500
it it's hot at first and in a weird way now, um,

173
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.340
because I have a book coming out in April and I know what that is going to cause

174
00:08:42.341 --> 00:08:44.920
that, that microscope to look at me or, you know, uh,

175
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.580
really fine tune on me is that I'm glad that I went through it. Now,

176
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.850
do you find that too? That you've been through a lot of the,

177
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.970
the hits on this stuff and it's like, that actually makes you stronger now. Oh.

178
00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.290
<v 0>Especially if it makes my audience stronger. Cause they love it because,</v>

179
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.770
because there's, it's like a greatest hits album, right? So it's xenophobic,

180
00:09:03.771 --> 00:09:06.980
racist, homophobic, blah, blah, blah. I'm from Brooklyn. I'm an immigrant.

181
00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:10.850
You know what I mean? So when they, I, uh, when I went after George Soros.

182
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.940
<v 2>Oh, we visited. Can you talk? Yeah. Talk about this. Cause this is, uh,</v>

183
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.670
this was, this is exactly why I think you're such a great thinker. Truly. What,

184
00:09:17.671 --> 00:09:18.504
what this whole story?

185
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.720
<v 0>Oh, it was beautiful. So, uh,</v>

186
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:23.120
some guy from the Atlantic and I'm not trying to be dismissive.

187
00:09:23.121 --> 00:09:24.470
I genuinely don't remember his name.

188
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:26.780
<v 2>Um, it's pretty terrible. They've.</v>

189
00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.670
<v 0>Been, but Dave, they were terrible since Woodrow Wilson.</v>

190
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.460
Don't I mean, even before the nation, I mean,

191
00:09:34.461 --> 00:09:37.670
these people were the ones agitating for world war one. I mean,

192
00:09:37.671 --> 00:09:40.430
you have to go back. So, um, they,

193
00:09:40.431 --> 00:09:45.170
there was Rudy Giuliani made a comment that he's more Jewish than George Soros.

194
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:50.270
Now, in any other context, if you were talking to Jewish people and said,

195
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:54.350
someone can be culturally Jewish without actually having Jewish ethnicity,

196
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.010
as opposed to someone could have Jewish ethnicity and basically be a total boy,

197
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.110
right? This is not controversial. This is very well known.

198
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.350
<v 2>Everyone knows this. Obama kept saying he was the first Jewish president. Yeah.</v>

199
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.180
<v 0>This is very known. We were both Jewish.</v>

200
00:10:05.181 --> 00:10:07.930
We know people who are super Jewish and then people who were basically waspy and

201
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.690
the people who are adopted you is basically like the culture. Um,

202
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.380
and the guy from the Atlantic was like, Ugh, in the world of Trump,

203
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.540
someone can be less Jewish somebody else.

204
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.960
And he's saying this about a literal Holocaust survivor, right.

205
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.860
Referring to Soros. Yeah. But what was amazing is in the same way,

206
00:10:24.861 --> 00:10:29.090
it's Dave Rubin, comma secret Klansmen and homophobe comma.

207
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:33.170
It's George Soros, comma literal Holocaust survivor.

208
00:10:33.171 --> 00:10:37.100
Now I always say the corporate press is factual, but not truthful.

209
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.670
