00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.210
<v 0>I don't want to be political here, but let's just talk facts.</v>

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.470
Barack Obama was wildly popular in Germany, wildly popular.

3
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.260
<v 1>Didn't he give that speech before it was before he was president when to like a</v>

4
00:00:12.261 --> 00:00:13.130
million people or something.

5
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.220
<v 0>Yeah. And he said, and he maintained his popularity. People loved him,</v>

6
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.800
but he didn't get any of his signature programs or policies through.

7
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.410
And I mean that you look at tip,

8
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.910
which was the economic signature program of,

9
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.430
of the Obama administration. The Germans killed it.

10
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.830
They literally led the fight to kill it. Nordstrom too. We said,

11
00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:40.490
don't build it. They went ahead and built it. Jacka Holly,

12
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.790
the Nazi prison guard, living in New York city for 12 years,

13
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.410
the us courts said, get them out of here. He lied to us.

14
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.410
We want them back in Germany, the Germans wouldn't take them.

15
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.490
The entire eight years of the Obama administration, they asked,

16
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.720
will you take this Nazi prison guard back? They ignored him defense spending.

17
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.470
We asked him very nice ways. Can you raise your defense spending? You know,

18
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.320
we think that you should be a better mate NATO member.

19
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.420
They largely didn't do it. And so all of those issues were,

20
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.610
were solved under the Trump administration.

21
00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:17.120
So I've actually said to chancellor Merkel and to, uh,

22
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.100
the foreign minister and to others in Germany,

23
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.490
you're going to have to deal with some tough tweets.

24
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.150
You're going to have to deal with some pushing and some ribbing,

25
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.130
because the only way that we can read this is that the Donald Trump style has

26
00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:31.964
worked.

27
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.690
<v 1>So Trump. Okay. So let's just sort of piecing this all together.</v>

28
00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:42.440
Then now you have this guy who you don't have to walk that tight rope,

29
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.340
tight rope.

30
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.820
<v 0>We had 17 candidates in the, uh, in,</v>

31
00:01:46.821 --> 00:01:51.290
in the primary and Donald Trump really just stuck out.

32
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.030
And so I was really excited to, to work for him.

33
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.910
I mean, look, this is a guy who,

34
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.170
who was very clear in the, in the campaign,

35
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.810
um, that, that he wanted to treat everybody the same. He really did.

36
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.890
And,

37
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.720
and so I liked working for him because he was challenging us on the Iraq war

38
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.960
implementation and saying, you know, uh,

39
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.590
I thought it was a disastrous decision. Um,

40
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.330
he was critiquing Bush and McCain and Romney's positions on the Iraq war

41
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.280
in a Republican primary. Now everybody around me had said, Oh,

42
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.173
he's done.

43
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.570
But that was all the Washington type people who were playing by the rules.

44
00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:38.000
And if you took their rules, he would have been done.

45
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.220
But the primary is really about the people outside of Washington.

46
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.480
And that's where I felt like I was reading the situation better than what they

47
00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:51.680
were, because my sphere wasn't what the Washington crowd was,

48
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.280
was saying about he's done. And, and he's not acting like a Republican.

49
00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.220
It was what the Republican base or the people and how they were

50
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:04.630
responding to. Yeah, that's an obvious the Iraq war,

51
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.360
uh, management didn't go well.

52
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.290
And so that was an honest assessment of, you know,

53
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:14.620
some people say touching the third rail of politics of,

54
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.110
of saying the things you're not supposed to say. And I liked that.

55
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.650
<v 1>But Rick, I don't understand. Everybody says,</v>

56
00:03:19.651 --> 00:03:22.950
if you listen to the mainstream media that everyone in the world,

57
00:03:22.951 --> 00:03:24.210
they don't respect us anymore.

58
00:03:24.211 --> 00:03:28.110
And they think he's a buffoon and all of these things could that possibly not be

59
00:03:28.111 --> 00:03:30.450
true. I mean, that's what the New York times is telling us.

60
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.900
I'm really joking aside. Like, what are you, what are you seeing?

61
00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:35.540
Like now as an ambassador,

62
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.730
when you go to all the NATO things and all the places you go to and all the

63
00:03:38.731 --> 00:03:42.450
meetings, do you sense like that people suddenly don't respect us.

64
00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:45.270
They used to respect us they'd own or were, or were not the Patsy anymore.

65
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:47.080
Perhaps like, what is the real.

66
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.910
<v 0>So I think what you're really asking is does his style work or does it not work</v>

67
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.060
right compared to Barack Obama style, which is much different?

68
00:03:54.061 --> 00:03:58.620
I think we should be honest and say, we got two different styles.

69
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.600
Absolutely Washington rule making will tell you

70
00:04:03.601 --> 00:04:08.040
that Trump's style does not work because he doesn't participate in what their

71
00:04:08.041 --> 00:04:10.350
rules are. But let's look at that.

72
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.910
Let's look at whether or not his style works because I'll take this argument all

73
00:04:14.911 --> 00:04:19.290
day long. I don't want to be political here, but let's just talk facts.

74
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.550
Barack Obama was wildly popular in Germany, wildly popular.

75
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.370
<v 1>Didn't he give that speech before it was before he was president,</v>

76
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.980
when was like a million people.

77
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.310
<v 0>Yeah. And he said, and he maintained his popularity. People loved him,</v>

78
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.890
but he didn't get any of his signature programs or policies through.

79
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.500
And I mean that you look at tip,

80
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.000
which was the economic signature program of,

81
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.520
of the Obama administration. The Germans killed it.

82
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.920
They literally led the fight to kill it. Nordstrom too. We said,

83
00:04:52.921 --> 00:04:56.580
don't build it. They went ahead and built it. Jacka Holly,

84
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.880
the Nazi prison guard, living in New York city for 12 years,

85
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.500
the us courts said, get them out of here. He lied to us.

86
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.470
We want them back in Germany, the Germans wouldn't take them.

87
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.580
The entire eight years of the Obama administration, they asked,

88
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.780
will you take this Nazi prison guard back? They ignored him defense spending.

89
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.560
We asked him very nice ways. Can you raise your defense spending? You know,

90
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.410
we think that you should be a better mate NATO member.

91
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.510
They largely didn't do it. And so all of those issues were,

92
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.700
were solved under the Trump administration.

93
00:05:29.701 --> 00:05:33.210
So I've actually said to chancellor Merkel and to, uh,

94
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.190
the foreign minister and to others in Germany,

95
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.550
you're going to have to deal with some tough tweets.

96
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.240
You're going to have to deal with some pushing and some ribbing,

97
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.220
because the only way that we can read this is that the Donald Trump style has

98
00:05:47.221 --> 00:05:48.360
worked. Do you think.

99
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.960
<v 1>Secretly like it, but sort of publicly? I don't mean Germany specifically,</v>

100
00:05:51.961 --> 00:05:54.390
but generally that countries and leaders,

101
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.940
they have to sort of pretend that they don't like Trump,

102
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.480
but as they see the U sort of reassert itself,

103
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.960
and maybe even as he forces them to pay a little bit more, actually pay their,

104
00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:04.280
share that in a weird way.

105
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:07.310
They almost do like it because it helps give them a little bit of their

106
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:09.590
sovereignty back or, or a little ownership.

107
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.360
<v 0>No, that's 100% for sure. Uh,</v>

108
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.460
I think the publics in Europe,

109
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.560
like to have the ability to have their sovereignty back, they,

110
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.580
they love, uh, and, and president Trump has said this to chancellor Merkel.

111
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.200
I don't blame you for not paying your NATO bill and for buying cheap Russian

112
00:06:29.201 --> 00:06:34.180
gas and having a $69 billion surplus over us and having a surplus

113
00:06:34.181 --> 00:06:38.110
and 50,000 American troops protecting you. I don't blame you,

114
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.830
who wouldn't do that if you were the chancellor of Germany, but then he says,

115
00:06:41.831 --> 00:06:45.010
but now it stops here because you outsmarted all these other presidents.

116
00:06:45.011 --> 00:06:47.140
And now I have to stick up for my people. So.

117
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.550
<v 1>Right. About all this stuff,</v>

118
00:06:48.551 --> 00:06:52.840
and now countries are paying more and all of these things, he is totally right.

119
00:06:52.841 --> 00:06:55.660
Yeah. So granted, so, right.

120
00:06:55.661 --> 00:06:59.170
So suddenly countries are starting to pay their share. Is it just,

121
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.360
is it just what you're saying?

122
00:07:01.361 --> 00:07:04.510
That it was just the way Washington always worked and that it,

123
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.640
or is it just that we've refused to use any influence on countries

124
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.360
like that? We were just, it was just always easier to just be like, ah,

125
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.300
we'll pay for everything or, you know what I mean? Like.

126
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.290
<v 0>Some of it is our own fault and you're getting out of that.</v>

127
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:22.120
<v 1>That's what, I guess that's what I'm asking that it was just,</v>

128
00:07:22.121 --> 00:07:25.240
we kept bringing in people that just were always like, Oh, we're paying them.

129
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.260
<v 0>Yeah. And we've gotta be nice and all they're pushing back and we want to be pro</v>

130
00:07:29.261 --> 00:07:33.490
European. And, and so let's just have a dinner party and, and, you know,

131
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.420
a lot of parties yeah. And sitting in European capitals and really, you know,

132
00:07:37.421 --> 00:07:37.870
we spent,

133
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.280
we have all of these people in European capitals working at our embassies.

134
00:07:42.281 --> 00:07:47.050
I look, I think our embassies should be many commerce sections. You know,

135
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:51.540
I've got a whole bunch of people at the embassy who are super smart and,

136
00:07:51.541 --> 00:07:55.660
and very committed to the United States and do great public service.

137
00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:00.760
But I have come to the conclusion that having the whole team of people watching

138
00:08:00.761 --> 00:08:04.780
the German political system and reporting back to Washington,

139
00:08:04.781 --> 00:08:08.050
by writing cables about what's happening in,

140
00:08:08.051 --> 00:08:10.660
in the governor's race minister,

141
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.160
president's race in a state in Germany and all of that stuff. Super interesting,

142
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.690
completely irrelevant.

143
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.980
In many ways we can get that information off the internet after it happens.

144
00:08:20.981 --> 00:08:22.900
We don't need reporting officers to do that.

145
00:08:22.901 --> 00:08:27.310
What we do need are economic specialists on LNG, liquid,

146
00:08:27.311 --> 00:08:32.080
natural gas or economic specialists on medical devices to help us get

147
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.330
us companies growing in Europe.

148
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.980
I think that our embassies need to be transformed last on the political side.

149
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.570
Last about the politics of the country that we can get through the internet.

150
00:08:43.571 --> 00:08:45.730
All this was established before we had the internet,

151
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.520
and now we need to turn these, uh,

152
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:53.470
these embassies into America, first economic models,

153
00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:55.980
just like what other countries do. Um,

154
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.520
we're the only country in the world that gets in trouble for pushing ourself

155
00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.620
forward. Everybody's doing it,

156
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.620
but we're the one that gets in trouble for saying, Oh, how dare you?

157
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.880
<v 1>Yeah. Did you, by any chance read that book that I've got right there?</v>

158
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.410
You Rome Harvoni the virtue of nationalism. No. Uh, because his whole,

159
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.130
his whole idea of which one is Mary's though. Oh, there you go. Well,

160
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.680
there's plenty of, there's a couple of good Douglas Murray books over here, but,

161
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:19.191
uh, the,

162
00:09:19.191 --> 00:09:23.300
the basic premise of the book is that strong nations that you have to be a

163
00:09:23.301 --> 00:09:26.900
strong nation first. So be America first be Germany first,

164
00:09:26.901 --> 00:09:29.330
be whatever your country is first. And that's how you,

165
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.950
by being a strong nation first,

166
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:34.340
then you can create some sort of international community that makes sense.

167
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.380
But that really we're just doing it all backwards.

168
00:09:36.381 --> 00:09:38.300
Or we've been doing it backwards for decades,

169
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.980
which is we put ourselves down and the thinking that we're achieving some higher

170
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:46.020
goal or something, and then we're ended, we ended up screwing over it.

171
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.850
<v 0>Yeah. I think that makes a lot of sense. And, and, you know,</v>

172
00:09:49.851 --> 00:09:54.050
sometimes you have to be able to put forward in a,

173
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.070
in a pushy way, your position in order to get things done.

174
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.980
And that doesn't mean that the relationship is ruined,

175
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.170
but it just means that this is a priority.

176
00:10:03.171 --> 00:10:05.420
And so you're going to push it harder. Um,

177
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:09.560
I think that's been one of the problems that we've had is just this kind of

178
00:10:09.561 --> 00:10:13.220
status quo. Let's all, you know, you're supposed to say what you want.

179
00:10:13.221 --> 00:10:15.560
And I'm supposed to say what I want. And then we,

180
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:20.600
we kind of cut the baby in half and we go away and go to lunch. And to me,

181
00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:24.950
that's not diplomacy. I mean, we have to be able to push forward our agenda,

182
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.170
by the way, I've never,

183
00:10:27.171 --> 00:10:31.970
I've been in thousands of diplomatic discussions, thousands.

184
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:35.660
I've never been in one where the other side doesn't ask for something.

185
00:10:35.661 --> 00:10:39.500
And we ask for something in return, happens all the time.

186
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:44.810
This is called diplomacy. What do you want, what do I want? You know,

187
00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:46.040
it's this whole thing.

188
00:10:46.041 --> 00:10:50.450
And the idea that you're asking for something is not a quid pro quo,

189
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.830
it's called diplomacy.

190
00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:56.600
This is exactly what we do is we show up to a meeting and we give our agenda of

191
00:10:56.601 --> 00:10:58.760
what we'd like you to do and what we need.

192
00:10:58.761 --> 00:11:02.510
And then you do that and we pick and choose. And when you make it a priority,

193
00:11:02.511 --> 00:11:06.470
this is what I would say on the jacket, poly, the, the Nazi prison guard thing.

194
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.940
Uh, when I showed up in Germany and I made this a priority, and I said,

195
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.070
this return of the Nazi prison guard,

196
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.040
I brought it up in my first meeting with the foreign minister.

197
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.370
And you know what the foreign minister said to me after I brought it up,

198
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.970
I've never heard of this case. I mean, that's incredible.

199
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:26.720
The state department had told me, Oh, we've asked for 12 years. It's,

200
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.120
it's going to go nowhere, but you should bring it up. I,

201
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.920
in my Senate confirmation, I got a written question. Will you make DACA,

202
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:39.230
Polly, the return of the Nazi prison guard? Will you make it a priority? I said,

203
00:11:39.231 --> 00:11:42.920
yes. And I, and I did it. And then president Trump said to me,

204
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.430
you should really get that Nazi prison guard returned. And I'm like, I'm on it.

205
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:50.030
I brought it up in every meeting. I made it a priority,

206
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.040
had to educate them. They returned them.

207
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.430
