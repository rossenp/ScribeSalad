1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.390
<v 0>That is the rub right now with, with black lives matter,</v>

2
00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:08.100
because when you go to the black lives matter, the organizations website,

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.020
right? And then I'm not talking about, you know,

4
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:12.000
the Don Lemon's one uncover for them in the media.

5
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:14.430
I'm not talking about when you go to the organization's website,

6
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.000
they say things like they're in favor of abolishing, the nuclear family,

7
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.460
I'm censoring LGBTQ plus people, all of this stuff,

8
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.560
all of this stuff that the vast majority of regular

9
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:33.510
working class, black Americans are not super into or even down with.

10
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:35.970
So there is a lot of that tension there.

11
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.730
<v 1>Let's make this about us for a second. So if you take two guys,</v>

12
00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:46.220
like if you take two guys like us, you take Dave Rubin,

13
00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:48.200
you take Rob Smith and you go, wait a minute.

14
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.750
These guys sort of seem like what would be,

15
00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:53.780
I think you could call sort of new conservative, something like that.

16
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.930
We don't look like a, you know, we're, we're both married to dudes.

17
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.460
That's a little different than a, you know, traditional conservatism. Um,

18
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.470
what do you think, what do you think are kind of new role or the younger,

19
00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:11.120
newer conservative role is within the conservative movement?

20
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.120
<v 0>Okay. So this is what I think. And I've been,</v>

21
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.350
I think about this a lot and it's like everything that I'm doing from, from,

22
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.790
from here on, out with,

23
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.490
with everything that we'll be talking about a little bit is about this.

24
00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:23.324
So it's like,

25
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.140
how do we usher in the conservative movement and the conservative movement into

26
00:01:27.141 --> 00:01:29.930
this new era where you got more black people, you got more,

27
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.720
more people of color, you got more gays, you got whatever.

28
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.910
And I think that what we do is we define a

29
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:42.890
love for country and a love for America that is not completely uncritical,

30
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.080
but it is not based in some sort of idea that it was

31
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.910
created to permanently and perpetually keep people like us

32
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.980
at, in some way of press. Because I think that the, um, and I was speaking with,

33
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.100
uh, with, with, uh, Lara Trump earlier about this thing.

34
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.560
So this is about creating a more perfect union.

35
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.480
So this is not about pretending that America was always perfect. This is about,

36
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.060
this is about perfecting this union.

37
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.310
And we have to open up this idea of the American experiment to everybody because

38
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.440
what the left says right now, that people like you and people like me and,

39
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:23.960
and a lot of different people is that America was never for you.

40
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.000
America is not for you. You cannot survive here. You cannot exist here.

41
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.550
This, uh, system is racist.

42
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:36.410
And the only way that you will ever be free or be successful is if you join

43
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.330
with us in pairing this all down via, via socialism, leftism,

44
00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:45.200
whatever you want to call it. And so our job is to reach out to,

45
00:02:45.201 --> 00:02:47.090
to not only to people like us,

46
00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:50.870
but also these mainstream conservatives that look like your typical

47
00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:52.070
conservative. They, they,

48
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.730
those people make up a lot of the people that follow both of us.

49
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.650
And so in the kind of bring everybody into this of,

50
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:04.360
of what is America and how do we love America from all vantage points?

51
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.640
<v 1>Yeah. I think the hard part for some people,</v>

52
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.370
when they see what people like we are doing, people like us,

53
00:03:11.371 --> 00:03:13.620
I think the hard part is they go, well, wait a minute,

54
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.330
there's still such a strong religious bent to the right,

55
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.350
that this just doesn't make sense. They think you guys are sinners,

56
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.330
something like that. And people will go, well, Rubin,

57
00:03:24.331 --> 00:03:26.490
how can you be friends with Shapiro? And it's like, yes,

58
00:03:26.491 --> 00:03:28.830
he has a different view of biblical marriage,

59
00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:33.210
but he's not trying to legislate my life. It does put a cap on our friendship,

60
00:03:33.211 --> 00:03:33.481
right.

61
00:03:33.481 --> 00:03:37.050
I can be friends with you in a way that I can't be with him because of that

62
00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:38.820
thing, but it's, but it doesn't,

63
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.910
but I know he's way more tolerant than all the other people that are screaming

64
00:03:41.911 --> 00:03:45.270
about tolerance all the time. Uh, but what would you say to a young,

65
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.400
a young gay person that is trying to become part of this or,

66
00:03:49.401 --> 00:03:52.020
or understand this? What would you say to them about that?

67
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.760
<v 0>I would say to them that first of all, just like you articulated it pretty well,</v>

68
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.920
um, is that a difference of opinion and actively legislating against things that

69
00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.740
are, are two different things, right. And you know,

70
00:04:04.741 --> 00:04:07.050
it gets into the religious freedom conversation,

71
00:04:07.051 --> 00:04:09.570
which is a whole other conversation as well.

72
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.550
But this is what I say to the younger gay person that is

73
00:04:14.551 --> 00:04:16.620
reaching out to me that may be leaning conservative,

74
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.620
and that has problems with the religious thing. First of all, I tell them,

75
00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:21.810
number one, you know, you're Jewish, I'm Christian.

76
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.610
I think that the left in the far left uses,

77
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.920
um, they use this, this idea that most, uh,

78
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.100
evangelical Christians are super far right? Hate gay people,

79
00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:40.050
all of that stuff to separate them from the gift that is having a connection

80
00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:43.530
to whatever your belief is for me, if that believe in Christianity.

81
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.610
And I believe in God, and they would want to separate these guys,

82
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.230
these young, um,

83
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.240
gays and lesbians from that so that they can worship at the alter of leftism

84
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.410
so that they can worst about the author alter politics so that they can worship

85
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.090
at the alter of, as I always call it the LGBTQ Colt.

86
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.160
So they want these kids worshiping at that altar and not at the alter

87
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.250
of their creator, whoever they believe that they may be,

88
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.390
if that makes any sense at all. And I'll tell you, furthermore,

89
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.490
that I have made inroads with a lot of these

90
00:05:20.491 --> 00:05:24.360
conservative Christians. And they'll say, look, I still believe like you and,

91
00:05:24.361 --> 00:05:27.750
and binge appear, even though you haven't been some parable Jewish,

92
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.020
I'll have these conversations with these conservative Christians and they'll

93
00:05:31.021 --> 00:05:34.290
say, hi, my belief is that marriage is between a man and a woman.

94
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.210
That is what I believe, but you go ahead and live your best life.

95
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.440
And it, neither of us are hurting each other. We can co-exist.

96
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.360
And that is tolerant.

97
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.370
<v 1>That is tolerance. That, that is America. Uh, you know, it's like, I,</v>

98
00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:52.350
I spoke at Liberty university,

99
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.410
the largest evangelical college in the United States in front of 14,000 kids was

100
00:05:57.411 --> 00:06:00.980
like a true political rally. The biggest crowd I've ever spoken in front of.

101
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.040
And they freaking loved me. And I went around campus all day long,

102
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:06.980
shaking hands and hugging people. And it was great. And it's like,

103
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.600
those are the intolerant people.

104
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.520
I think we're doing something backwards over here.

105
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.080
<v 0>Yeah. Maybe. Um, and it seems like nowadays,</v>

106
00:06:14.081 --> 00:06:18.040
like the most intolerant people are on the left.

107
00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:20.440
These are the people that are the most intolerant.

108
00:06:20.441 --> 00:06:25.000
These are the people that are the most likely to, to throw out slurs, you know,

109
00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.240
homophobe, racist, not see all of this other stuff.

110
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.100
The people who even slightly, um, disagree with any of their stuff,

111
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.870
or even gen Gentili call out, left as policies.

112
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.630
This is what they do. And these are shutdown terms.

113
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.550
I hope that they start to mean less. Um, as we move into this,

114
00:06:45.551 --> 00:06:47.410
this new world we're trying to get into.

115
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.580
<v 1>Yeah. So I know you hate sort of the phrase community,</v>

116
00:06:51.581 --> 00:06:53.860
whether we would say the black community or the LGBT community,

117
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.950
because we are all individuals ultimately, but sometimes,

118
00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.340
sometimes we just need some of these words to explain situations,

119
00:07:00.341 --> 00:07:05.080
but do you sense a really weird tension in the black community

120
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.480
related to identity because of color and then the sexuality

121
00:07:10.481 --> 00:07:14.920
thing, because it seems to me, and we keep seeing videos of this pop-up online,

122
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.400
where there'll be black people that are suddenly they're stuck in this

123
00:07:18.401 --> 00:07:20.620
intersectional thing and they're suddenly going, no,

124
00:07:20.621 --> 00:07:25.510
I have traditional beliefs and I'm not down with all that LGBT stuff.

125
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:30.310
And these things have been sort of morphed into a very weird thing where

126
00:07:30.311 --> 00:07:32.770
suddenly, if you, if you're,

127
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.010
you have to be suddenly black trans lives matter,

128
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.980
I'm personally flying with black trans people, of course,

129
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.010
but suddenly they create this thing where it's just like,

130
00:07:42.011 --> 00:07:43.840
you have to be for all of these things,

131
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.690
no matter what your other set of beliefs are.

132
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:52.000
<v 0>So that is the rub right now with, with black lives matter,</v>

133
00:07:52.001 --> 00:07:56.710
because when you go to the black lives matter, the organization's website,

134
00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.630
right? And then I'm not talking about, you know,

135
00:07:58.631 --> 00:08:00.580
the Don Lemon's one uncovered for them in the media.

136
00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:03.010
I'm not talking about when you go to the organization's website,

137
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.120
they say things like they're in favor of abolishing, the nuclear family, um,

138
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.040
censoring, LGBTQ plus people, all of this stuff,

139
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:17.170
all of this stuff that the vast majority of regular

140
00:08:17.171 --> 00:08:22.120
working class, black Americans are not super into or even down with.

141
00:08:22.121 --> 00:08:25.390
So there is a lot of that tension there. Um,

142
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:30.370
and this is the problem with when you let brands,

143
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:35.290
organizations and corporations define black because

144
00:08:35.291 --> 00:08:37.360
black lives matter does not define black.

145
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.620
My blackness is not defined by black lives matter or any of their founders or

146
00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:44.080
any of the people that have, you know,

147
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:48.520
put themselves in the position to speak for this organization. Like I said, I,

148
00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.980
this is an organization as a corporation. Um,

149
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.350
this is a business and they don't speak for me.

150
00:08:53.351 --> 00:08:57.870
So there is a lot of tension there. And furthermore,

151
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.860
so I talk a lot about, I say LGBTQ cult a lot, right? Um,

152
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.130
so there are gays and they're lesbians and there are bisexuals and there are

153
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:08.880
transgender people, most of which are law abiding tax,

154
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:13.740
paying citizens that just want to live their lives and pretty much be left

155
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:14.574
alone.

156
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:19.110
Then there is the LGBTQ cult in the cultists

157
00:09:19.111 --> 00:09:22.650
say that you will listen to whatever we say,

158
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.410
whatever we change is the idea.

159
00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:28.050
So if we want to use pronouns,

160
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:31.050
this is what you call us or else we will find you. Um,

161
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.490
if you do not agree with adding transgender women to the

162
00:09:35.491 --> 00:09:38.100
spaces for actual women,

163
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:42.480
you are now transphobic and it is all of that stuff that is going
