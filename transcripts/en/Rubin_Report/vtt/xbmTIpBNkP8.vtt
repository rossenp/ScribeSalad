00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.780
<v 0>With regard to general Flynn and his unmasking.</v>

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.570
I think it goes at least up to Joe Biden, Joe Biden.

3
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:10.530
We now have documents that were declassified yesterday by Rick Grinnell that

4
00:00:10.531 --> 00:00:14.520
show the Joe Biden requested the unmasking of general Flynn.

5
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.180
<v 2>I'm Dave Rubin. And this is the Rubin report. Quick reminder,</v>

6
00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:28.970
everybody to subscribe to our channel and click that little bell.

7
00:00:28.971 --> 00:00:31.790
So you get delivered our videos. And more importantly,

8
00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:36.530
joining me today is the junior Senator from Kentucky and the fiercest defender

9
00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:41.210
of Liberty that we have in the United States government, Senator Rand, Paul,

10
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.650
I'm thrilled. You're finally joining us today, be on your show.

11
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.880
All right, so let's dive in. I think we're just going to split this interview.

12
00:00:49.881 --> 00:00:51.110
I know you've got about a half hour.

13
00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:52.910
We're going to just split it into two parts.

14
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.080
Let's spend the first half talking about this Pfizer amendment, uh,

15
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.700
that you just proposed. Uh, can you just talk a little bit about why you did it,

16
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:03.110
what's going on with surveillance?

17
00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:07.340
I sense people are seriously confused about the whole Flynn case,

18
00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:10.310
what the Obama administration may or may not have known.

19
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.400
So if you could just kind of do a one Oh one to clean up some of that,

20
00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:14.234
that would be great.

21
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.380
<v 0>The Pfizer court is the foreign intelligence surveillance court,</v>

22
00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:23.150
and it was set up in the seventies basically to investigate spy

23
00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:27.590
on surveil foreigners and possible terrorists. Um,

24
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.340
it was never intended really to be used against political candidate candidates

25
00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:35.870
or to investigate American political campaigns or American political figures.

26
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.100
But as everybody know,

27
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.930
this is what the secret court that they used to go after president Trump in

28
00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:45.980
2016 in the summer and the fall. And, uh,

29
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.690
I think this was a horrendous abuse of power and using a secret court to go

30
00:01:50.691 --> 00:01:54.080
after an American, I think is a, is a travesty of justice.

31
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.250
So this is a court that lacks, uh, constitutional protections.

32
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.200
When you go to a regular court,

33
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.260
a constitutional court that was established by article three of the

34
00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:07.100
constitution, you get a lawyer, that's one obvious thing you get,

35
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.840
but you also get the fourth amendment.

36
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.100
The fourth amendment says that they can't search your house or your phone or any

37
00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:16.760
of these things unless they go to a judge and they have to say that there's

38
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:20.810
probable cause that you committed a crime. It's a, it's a fairly high standard,

39
00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:23.960
but it's the constitutional standard in the visor court.

40
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.300
They go to it and they say, well,

41
00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:29.870
you just have to have probable cause that we think you are associated with a

42
00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:33.050
foreign government. So that's what they do at Carter page. They said, Oh,

43
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.800
we see you've talked to the Russians. And he said, well, yeah, I told the CIA,

44
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.210
you know, I run into Russians. I do business I'm in these think tanks. And I,

45
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.450
I told the CIA and they know that I've talked to the Russians before and I've

46
00:02:44.451 --> 00:02:48.800
tried to give them information. They discounted all that lied with the court.

47
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.880
And then what began this whole Trump investigation. But here's my point.

48
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.810
A lot of Republicans, a lot of conservatives, a lot of libertarians are upset.

49
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:57.703
How do you fix it?

50
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.370
One way of it is to try to make the Pfizer court system more like

51
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.360
a constitutional court. So add protections in the scheme of things.

52
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.410
But here's my point. I don't think it's possible to make it constitutional.

53
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.610
They don't notify you that they're investigating you. So it's secret.

54
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.530
You don't get a lawyer.

55
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.100
Some of the reforms are to give you a friend Amaka so somebody,

56
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:24.010
a friend of the court that argues three, but they still don't tell you,

57
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.270
you have been accused of anything.

58
00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:29.200
So you don't really direct a lawyer to direct your defense.

59
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.480
And so I don't think it fixes a system. So my amendment would simply say this,

60
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.290
the visor court really isn't constitutional for Americans.

61
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.770
So let's exempt Americans from it and let's use it only on foreigners. It is,

62
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.920
you know, for all, it's called the foreign intelligence court.

63
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.400
Why don't we go after foreigners with it? And people said, well, what if,

64
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.420
what if there really was a spine and political campaign? What would you do?

65
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.220
Well, use the constitution, go to a judge, ask for, uh,

66
00:03:56.221 --> 00:04:01.090
a warrant to search the person or to surveil the person and judges do grab

67
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:02.800
things like that. But you have to have evidence,

68
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.680
but you'd also have to UMaine the bill of rights in the fourth amendment.

69
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.770
That's where I'm for. But unfortunately I'm in the minority up here.

70
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:13.420
I think that would win with your crowd watching, but I'm afraid it probably,

71
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.330
it didn't have enough votes in the Senate to win. Yeah.

72
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.640
<v 2>Yeah. Well, I assure you,</v>

73
00:04:17.641 --> 00:04:22.050
you're doing just fine in the majority on my audience and we've got some work to

74
00:04:22.051 --> 00:04:25.860
do there. So can you just clarify a little bit, it seems that sort of right.

75
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.791
Leaning Twitter,

76
00:04:26.791 --> 00:04:31.230
let's call it right now is saying that this stuff really went up the chain of

77
00:04:31.231 --> 00:04:36.030
command and it's possible now that Biden and or Obama themselves actually knew

78
00:04:36.031 --> 00:04:39.000
about it and were, were instigating some of this stuff.

79
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.850
What's the actual evidence at this point?

80
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.220
<v 0>Well, with regard to general Flynn and his unmasking,</v>

81
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.010
I think it goes at least up to Joe Biden, Joe Biden.

82
00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:53.820
We now have documents that were declassified yesterday by Rick Grinnell,

83
00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:57.990
that show that Joe Biden requested the unmasking of general Flynn.

84
00:04:57.991 --> 00:04:58.890
What does that mean?

85
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.410
They get like a national security or a fossa warrant to listen to the phone

86
00:05:04.411 --> 00:05:07.200
call of the Russian ambassador.

87
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.950
I can kind of understand that we spot ambassadors based by an next week.

88
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.060
It goes on around the world.

89
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.070
But if that ambassador is talking to a person who's elected to our government or

90
00:05:17.071 --> 00:05:20.520
part of the administration like general Flynn, they're supposed to say, Oh no,

91
00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:24.030
he's talking to an American. We're not supposed to listen. Or if we listen,

92
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.780
we're not supposed to unmask that person. Well, the thing is,

93
00:05:27.781 --> 00:05:30.510
if you're a prominent person, a lot of people know you by your voice.

94
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.960
And you may well introduce yourself by saying Mr. Ambassador,

95
00:05:33.961 --> 00:05:37.200
this is general Flynn. So it's kind of,

96
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.770
it's hard to really completely mask it, but here's the point.

97
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.310
You're only supposed to unmask that person if there's a national security

98
00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:47.550
reason. So if they're plotting to attack the us, you would say, well,

99
00:05:47.551 --> 00:05:50.340
that's reasonable. You unmask them to try to stop the plot.

100
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.950
But if they're discussing policy and the person's,

101
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.750
the national security advisor,

102
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.570
there would be absolutely no reason other than a politically motivated one.

103
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.830
So if this is politically motivated, then it becomes illegal surveillance,

104
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.260
illegal eavesdropping. And really, you remember,

105
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:10.460
we have this impeachment trial over them saying someone in government used

106
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:12.200
government to go after a political opponent,

107
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.240
turns out what they did to general Flynn sounds exactly like that.

108
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:18.350
They abused government.

109
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.260
They use surveillance to go after their political opponent.

110
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.840
<v 2>Are you worried for, for a limited government guy?</v>

111
00:06:25.841 --> 00:06:28.750
You don't want the administrative state to be too big.

112
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.650
It's like you can get in the weeds on all of this stuff, but in many ways,

113
00:06:32.651 --> 00:06:34.810
this is what you've spent your whole life fighting.

114
00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:39.100
That peop that the whole system has just gotten so big and crazy at this point.

115
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.600
That even if you tell people what's true and we have all the facts in front of

116
00:06:43.601 --> 00:06:45.880
us, that sort of the ship has sailed on,

117
00:06:45.881 --> 00:06:48.250
on reigning in the things that I think you and I,

118
00:06:48.251 --> 00:06:49.610
and most of my audience are worried.

119
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.010
<v 0>Yes and no. Um, I think if you were asking your audience,</v>

120
00:06:54.011 --> 00:06:57.010
obviously it's probably a very limited government audience,

121
00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.190
but even if we were asking a general audience. So for example,

122
00:07:00.191 --> 00:07:05.020
if I asked everybody in Kentucky about whether or not a secret court where you

123
00:07:05.021 --> 00:07:07.660
don't get a lawyer should investigate political campaigns,

124
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.590
other that polls at 75%, particularly to keep Trump out of it.

125
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:14.410
Now Trump's pretty popular my stage. So it doesn't hurt so much,

126
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.820
but really if you could get Trump out of it, but the problem is people get,

127
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.800
they won't vote on principle and idea.

128
00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:24.130
So I didn't get any Democrat votes on this and only got 11 Republicans,

129
00:07:24.131 --> 00:07:28.450
but I got no Democrats, even though many of them profess to, uh,

130
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.900
think that Pfizer has too much power and shouldn't be investigating Americans,

131
00:07:31.901 --> 00:07:35.890
they wouldn't vote for it because they saw it as a vote rebuking visa over

132
00:07:35.891 --> 00:07:38.290
Trump. And so they saw it as a political vote.

133
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.570
But I guess I don't look at it this way.

134
00:07:40.571 --> 00:07:45.190
I lose a lot of time and I'm I'm and I'm used to losing and votes in the

135
00:07:45.191 --> 00:07:46.024
Senate.

136
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.380
And I think most of this in this is where we do have some ability.

137
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.540
So we pass out a sheet of a prominent tweets that went out from

138
00:07:55.541 --> 00:07:59.890
senators each, each week on Wednesday. And all my office does this sheet.

139
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.520
And they all complained because we'll put out something in my tweet will have

140
00:08:03.521 --> 00:08:08.440
gotten 30,000 retweets and they will put out Senator so-and-so and they got six.

141
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:13.690
So one of the things they see is that the Liberty movement has

142
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.440
reach well beyond them. And they fear the electric.

143
00:08:17.441 --> 00:08:19.750
These people are afraid of elections. They're afraid of me.

144
00:08:19.751 --> 00:08:22.630
They're afraid of conservatives because they're afraid someday someone's going

145
00:08:22.631 --> 00:08:26.500
to wake up and challenge them in the primary. And that's what has to happen. Um,

146
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:27.580
the Democrats,

147
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.640
it's sort of like this Democrats don't care at all about the deficit and they'll

148
00:08:30.641 --> 00:08:32.890
tell you, and they want to spend more money. They're honest about it.

149
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:37.450
Republicans say they're against debt, say they're against spending,

150
00:08:37.451 --> 00:08:39.580
but they're also most of them,

151
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.610
big government Republicans vote lockstep with the Democrats.

152
00:08:42.611 --> 00:08:47.050
So really when people ask me whose fault is it Republican or Democrat? I say,

153
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.530
yeah, you know what? It's really party's fault,

154
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:55.650
but you know, we could give up and just try to protect ourselves. But, you know,

155
00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.570
I think if we give up and the view, good voices year, go away, then really,

156
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:03.360
I think it goes much quicker towards socialism.

157
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:06.450
It goes much quicker towards indebtedness and big government.

158
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:09.600
So I have to be some voices. There needs to be more,

159
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.650
the newer people up here I think are frankly better than, um, you know,

160
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:18.270
the ones that have been here a long time. So I have good conversations with, uh,

161
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:19.920
Senator Braun, uh,

162
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.840
Senator Rick Scott from Florida and who I think are open to as, you know,

163
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.460
an ISO amendment,

164
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.550
Mike Lee, or with me on the Pfizer amendment. Also.

165
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.980
<v 2>Can you talk a little bit about your relationship with Trump?</v>

166
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:40.520
Because one of the things that I've said to my audience repeatedly is first off,

167
00:09:40.521 --> 00:09:43.280
I should tell you, you'll appreciate this. I voted for Gary Johnson,

168
00:09:43.281 --> 00:09:46.160
I'm here in California. And I had the luxury of, you know,

169
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.250
doing a third-party situation, which obviously certain people,

170
00:09:49.251 --> 00:09:52.640
depending on where you live, you didn't have the luxury of doing that. Um,

171
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.370
but I wanted to make a vote for Liberty more than anything else,

172
00:09:55.371 --> 00:09:59.840
but one of the reasons that I've become more okay with Trump over the last

173
00:09:59.841 --> 00:10:03.710
couple of years is that the guy that I respect most in the Senate,

174
00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:08.720
you has become one of his big allies. And my feeling was well, if Ron Paul,

175
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.360
who I aligned with on so much of the Liberty stuff,

176
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:16.040
sees something in him that he can work with. Then I view that as a net. Good.

177
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.950
Can you talk about a little bit about your relationship personally,

178
00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:22.340
but also just what do you think his actual governing principles are?

179
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.760
Cause it's hard to say they're traditionally conservative or Republican or

180
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:26.653
whatever else.

181
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.960
<v 0>He doesn't come from a steep, uh,</v>

182
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.970
developed or possibly of libertarianism.

183
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:39.530
However, when you talk to him about warm and he talks about the Iraq war,

184
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.050
he gets it more than any other Republican,

185
00:10:42.051 --> 00:10:45.110
obviously other than my dad or myself or Mike Lee.

186
00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:45.950
<v 2>Gets it.</v>

187
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.220
