1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.740
<v 0>We walk up to him and he's sitting and Dunn Jr. Introduces me. And he says, dad,</v>

2
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:07.170
this is Dave Rubin. He has a great podcast, you know, blah, blah, blah.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.920
And Trump looks at, look at him and he's like, yo, I kind of recognize you.

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.490
And I was like, Oh, well, you know, I go on Fox. I'm on Tucker Tucker.

5
00:00:14.491 --> 00:00:17.430
That must be. And then he turns to you and he goes, when, who are you?

6
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.040
<v 1>You were, you I'm just standing there. Like, I don't know.</v>

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.610
<v 0>You go, well, I'm his husband. And he goes, husband, highly good.</v>

8
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.420
You are married. You two are married.

9
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.500
And then he slaps his hands on the table and he goes, he goes,

10
00:00:30.501 --> 00:00:33.890
I want to stand up. I want to stand up and shake your hands.

11
00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:35.630
I think that's great. I think that's good.

12
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.370
<v 1>A lot of he's like, he's like, honey,</v>

13
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.340
these two guys are married and he turns to me, he's like, you're too.

14
00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:42.590
You guys are too good looking. That's your problem. You're too good looking

15
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.980
Somebody that you have to mention when you have conversations on camera in 2020.

16
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.290
Yeah. President Donald J. Trump. Oh geez. So I was thinking,

17
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.830
it could be interesting for us to share with these fine people, our, uh,

18
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.770
own personal story of meeting the president. Uh,

19
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.600
because I don't think you've told this story, your house.

20
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.160
<v 0>I've only told this story. I think once publicly, which was on Glenn Beck,</v>

21
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.820
when I did the, um, what was it? It was super Tuesday,

22
00:01:22.821 --> 00:01:24.140
which now feels like a lifetime ago.

23
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:25.550
Remember when there was going to be an election.

24
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.520
And he was asking me something about Trump and I did tell the story, but,

25
00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:32.370
but basically outside of Glenn's audience. Um, and, and,

26
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.480
and some of our audience nobody's heard this story and certainly nobody's heard

27
00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:38.360
it from your perspective. So it would be interesting to talk about. So we did,

28
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.150
we did meet the president. Uh, so this was,

29
00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:46.010
I believe on December 22nd of 2019. So just to cover a couple of months ago,

30
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.840
it was either the 21st or 22nd.

31
00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:51.140
Cause I know that's the day I was speaking at this turning point. I mean,

32
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.000
honestly, I don't know why. Well, because I remember,

33
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.790
I remember thinking it's the last sort of thing I'm going to do for the year.

34
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.890
I think it's these mushroom supplements that you take in the morning.

35
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.850
I do like those mushrooms.

36
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.760
<v 1>Your brain, you feel, you know, I'd say you take these like really good,</v>

37
00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:04.820
like brain supplements that are, that are like, you know,

38
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.440
fo for focus and memory.

39
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.140
I think it works maybe because if you would ask me the day that would have been

40
00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:10.040
like maybe December 5th.

41
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.400
<v 0>Yeah. Well, I remember it was right before it was right before Christmas. Yeah.</v>

42
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.950
Um, well basically we were,

43
00:02:15.951 --> 00:02:18.980
I was giving a speech and then it was announced like right the day before,

44
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.780
or maybe even that morning that Trump was going to speak.

45
00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:23.660
And so I spoke and then they canceled a bunch of speakers and then Trump spoke.

46
00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:27.980
So in effect, I ended up opening for him, which was kind of interesting. Um,

47
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.570
and after the event, um, Charlie Kirk messaged me and he said, Oh,

48
00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:34.580
do you want to meet the president? I said, let's do it. He,

49
00:02:34.581 --> 00:02:38.720
they asked for some info and then we get on a short line of about 10 people.

50
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.260
They throw us in a little booth, we meet the president. It's very in and out.

51
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.430
Do you want to add anything to that?

52
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.380
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, basically just,</v>

53
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.310
I think we were standing in line with like Rob Smith. Yeah. And, uh,

54
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.811
I was like very,

55
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:52.740
the whole thing happened so quickly that I didn't even know the present was

56
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.390
going to be there. Yeah. And we were like, how's this going to work?

57
00:02:55.391 --> 00:02:59.380
And they took all of our phones and they literally threw us in this tent with

58
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:00.250
like, it was called a tent,

59
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.130
but basically they like hung for curtains so nobody could see that he was there

60
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.900
and it was so fast that it was like, they moved us in.

61
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.790
And by the time you turned to like, take the picture,

62
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.520
they were turning you to also exit you out of this room. Yeah.

63
00:03:14.521 --> 00:03:15.810
It was really seamless. It was like,

64
00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:17.940
you shake his hand and you had like a moment to say something to him,

65
00:03:17.941 --> 00:03:20.040
but it was like, you turn in, like they snap the photo,

66
00:03:20.041 --> 00:03:22.710
like while you're moving around and then you're out. And I was like,

67
00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:25.800
I don't even know where the camera was. And then we thought that that was it.

68
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.120
Like we met the president,

69
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.660
we got a photo who knows if we'll ever see this photo and thinking that that's

70
00:03:30.661 --> 00:03:31.494
it. And then we.

71
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.270
<v 0>So we have the photo and then,</v>

72
00:03:33.271 --> 00:03:35.760
and then Trump speaks and it was the first time we had ever heard him speak,

73
00:03:35.761 --> 00:03:38.250
which was, which was just putting aside whatever you think about Trump.

74
00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:41.010
It was just super interesting to watch the way he works with the crowd.

75
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.630
And he's sort of doing standup.

76
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.090
<v 1>Well, it was like going to a standup's. Yeah. And he's like in, you know,</v>

77
00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:49.020
he's off prompter and he's on, he's feeding his.

78
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.210
<v 0>I know more about windmills than anybody.</v>

79
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.520
<v 1>Laughing with them. Like it's a joke. Yeah.</v>

80
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.180
<v 0>But putting all that aside, uh, he speaks and then afterwards we,</v>

81
00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.320
we bumped into, uh, Don Jr. And he's become a good buddy of mine. And he said,

82
00:04:01.321 --> 00:04:06.090
would you like, would you, would David like to join us for dinner tonight? Um,

83
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.750
wait, I'm blanking.

84
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.110
<v 1>On her name. Kimberly, Kimberly. She was like, she was like, Hey,</v>

85
00:04:10.111 --> 00:04:13.080
like come over here. And she, I guess knew about me through you.

86
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.720
And she was like, you know, we've, we've got a table for the four of us,

87
00:04:15.721 --> 00:04:18.750
you know, can you, can you join us? Are you free? And I was like, sure. Okay.

88
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.600
Where do you want to go? And she's like, Oh, I'm Mar-a-Lago.

89
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.570
And I have to admit, like, you know,

90
00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:28.380
I'm not as plugged into all this stuff and that's, that's intentional. I,

91
00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:29.820
but I'm not as plugged into all of this stuff.

92
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.300
Obviously I've heard of Mar-a-Lago. But I do not know at this point,

93
00:04:33.301 --> 00:04:36.030
what Mar-a-Lago is. I don't know if it's a hotel.

94
00:04:36.031 --> 00:04:38.070
I don't know if it's a restaurant. I don't know if it's a golf course.

95
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.060
I come to learn. It's basically mine, but I really didn't know what it was.

96
00:04:42.061 --> 00:04:44.520
So when she said it was at Mar-a-Lago, I was like, Oh, so it is a restaurant,

97
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.750
but that just shows you how much I don't know about that. You know,

98
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.823
it's part of.

99
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.130
<v 0>So fortunately we had suits because we were supposed to go that night to an</v>

100
00:04:53.131 --> 00:04:55.860
event that Ben Shapiro was headlining and we were supposed to be in suits for

101
00:04:55.861 --> 00:04:59.190
that thing. Sorry, Ben, we, uh, we left yet to go see the president.

102
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.810
We go to Mar-a-Lago there's still like,

103
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.870
like an absolute insane security situation.

104
00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:06.240
And they have to like drive us around a small Island miles.

105
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.600
It was like crazy to get in there. We get in there really.

106
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.600
<v 1>Basically almost strip searched before throwing in the back of a golf cart.</v>

107
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.300
<v 0>Yeah. Like they really am. Well, it's the president, you know?</v>

108
00:05:15.301 --> 00:05:18.030
And then as you've described it, it's sort of like the Playboy mansion,

109
00:05:18.031 --> 00:05:22.680
but like doused in gold hairsprays, although it didn't feel cheesy at all,

110
00:05:22.681 --> 00:05:26.040
it actually felt kind of classy or old school or something.

111
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.830
And we go in and there's a main dining room.

112
00:05:28.831 --> 00:05:32.100
And I'd say there were probably about 50 people in the main dining room and

113
00:05:32.101 --> 00:05:35.910
Candace Owens was there. And a couple other people that we sort of knew.

114
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.180
And we were sort of whisked into the side room, which is,

115
00:05:39.181 --> 00:05:42.630
I guess the more exclusive room where there's maybe 20 people and our tables

116
00:05:42.631 --> 00:05:43.464
right. In the middle of.

117
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.720
<v 1>An extra layer of secret services to get into that.</v>

118
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.170
<v 0>Room. And they make sure no phones, no pictures, blah, blah, blah. Uh,</v>

119
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.240
our tables like literally in the center of the room.

120
00:05:51.241 --> 00:05:53.970
So the four of us have a nice dinner and sitting next to us, you know,

121
00:05:53.971 --> 00:05:58.910
one table over is president Trump and, and Rudy Giuliani.

122
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:00.830
And they have two other, two or three other people there.

123
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.070
And we have a great dinner. We had a great time, right? Like totally fun.

124
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:08.090
And Don doesn't drink. But, uh, and when some, one funny thing was happening,

125
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.770
but somehow the way we were sitting, I kept drinking your wine.

126
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.280
So basically I had like seven glasses of wine. Yeah.

127
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.470
<v 1>Until I realized what was happening. It's because you're a lefty, which, Oh,</v>

128
00:06:20.471 --> 00:06:23.380
that's what it was. You see what I did here actually today,

129
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.340
because this isn't a real shirt. I let you have your water on your left side.

130
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.320
Normally I make the water on that side. And then.

131
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.850
<v 0>People say, I lost. They say I lost them. I left he Craig, look at that. Um,</v>

132
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.240
anyway, then at the end of the meal, Jr says, Hey,

133
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.040
are you going to take some of your water go crazy? Uh, junior says, Hey,

134
00:06:39.041 --> 00:06:41.560
do you want to meet my dad? I was like, all right. Yeah, let's meet your dad.

135
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.600
So we'd go up to him. And remember,

136
00:06:43.601 --> 00:06:46.660
this is like two or three days after impeachment had just been announced,

137
00:06:46.661 --> 00:06:49.510
which feels like another lifetime ago at this point. And everyone,

138
00:06:49.511 --> 00:06:51.550
every story was about Trump is freaking out.

139
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.660
Walls are closing in and he's a paranoid lunatic. The guy's sitting there.

140
00:06:55.661 --> 00:06:57.520
He had no tie on. He looked totally relaxed.

141
00:06:57.521 --> 00:07:01.660
His hair was a little more disheveled than usual. He was having a ball laughing.

142
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.880
You were living on the moon. He didn't know who Donald Trump.

143
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.830
<v 1>You didn't know who the president of United States was.</v>

144
00:07:05.831 --> 00:07:08.110
And all of a sudden you found yourself in this room and they said to you,

145
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.710
the president of the United States is in this room. Who do you think it is?

146
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.800
I guarantee you, you would never think it was him.

147
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.950
This guy was sitting there pretty quiet for the most of dinner,

148
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.640
just listening to other people, listening to his wife speak mostly actually.

149
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.170
And it was, I was expecting this like loud bombastic blowhard,

150
00:07:26.171 --> 00:07:29.890
sort of like nothing even against him. It's just, I think everyone can agree.

151
00:07:29.891 --> 00:07:33.640
Like he's you would think he's, this would be the center of attention.

152
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.290
Sucking a lot of the energy out of the room.

153
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.680
<v 0>Yeah, it was, it was the reverse. So,</v>

154
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.120
so we walk up to him and he's sitting and Dunn Jr. Introduces me. And he says,

155
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.000
dad, this is Dave Rubin. He has a great podcast, you know, blah, blah, blah.

156
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.750
And Trump looks at look when he's like, yo, I kind of recognize you.

157
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.320
And I was like, Oh, well, you know, I go on Fox. I'm on Tucker IDs. Oh, Tucker,

158
00:07:53.321 --> 00:07:56.410
that must be. And then he turns to you and he goes, man, who are you?

159
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:01.120
If you're standing there, who are you? And you go, well, I'm his husband.

160
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:05.260
And he goes, husband, I think the two are married. You two are married.

161
00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:09.340
And then he slaps his hands on the table and he goes, he goes,

162
00:08:09.341 --> 00:08:12.730
I want to stand up. I want to stand up and shake your hands.

163
00:08:12.731 --> 00:08:14.770
I think that's great. I think that's justice.

164
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.740
<v 1>He's like, he's like, honey, these two guys are married and he turns me.</v>

165
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.650
He's like, you're too. You guys are too good looking. That's your problem.

166
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.750
You're too good looking. And he's like, I got to shake your hand.

167
00:08:22.751 --> 00:08:26.200
That's fantastic. That's fantastic. And then he says, he goes, you know,

168
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:30.430
I don't give a. And he goes, and I don't think anybody else does either.

169
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.600
And then in a very Trump way. And also, I don't think anybody has for 20 years,

170
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.810
no, one's given a for 20 years. And I realized at that point I was like, Oh,

171
00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:40.660
he thinks that I think he's probably a homophobe because I'm gay.

172
00:08:40.661 --> 00:08:44.190
And that's what we've been told by the media. But I think that moment, like, I,

173
00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:46.990
I mean, I knew already he wasn't a homophobe, so I'm not thinking that,

174
00:08:46.991 --> 00:08:51.700
but I realized how much does that suck for him to have to preface that

175
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.910
after he meets a gay couple to say, you know, like, you know, I don't care.

176
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.240
Like, like we're cool. Right. Um.

177
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.660
<v 0>And then Melania was making eyes at, you would crush.</v>

178
00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.770
<v 1>You like, she was like talking to her family. They kept pointing at me.</v>

179
00:09:01.771 --> 00:09:03.000
So you wouldn't Trump,

180
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.580
aren't talking about like Tulsi Gabbert and a couple other like policy.

181
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.920
Well then Trump Jr. Got kind of.

182
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:09.410
<v 0>Wait for a second. So then I'm there with Trump for like five minutes.</v>

183
00:09:09.411 --> 00:09:11.600
And I'm telling him about my crazy theories about my book.

184
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:13.910
<v 1>Let you guys have a moment.</v>

185
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.350
<v 0>Totally fun and interesting. And anyway, go ahead. So then you were in London.</v>

186
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.990
<v 1>And I went over to Melanie and I was like, I was like, hello.</v>

187
00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:26.030
And she looks up and she was like, how old are you in a very, like, you're very,

188
00:09:26.031 --> 00:09:27.260
you know, pickaxe and how old are you?

189
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.720
And I realized what happened was her and her friend were trying to figure out

190
00:09:29.721 --> 00:09:32.000
how old I was. And they thought I was too young to be in that room.

191
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:36.080
So it was a whole dude. Do you think I am? And she was like 20 and I was like,

192
00:09:36.081 --> 00:09:40.760
no, I'm 31. And she was like, Oh, you have beautiful skin. And so I was like,

193
00:09:40.761 --> 00:09:45.200
wow, thanks. And I was like, so do you, and then I, and then I, you know, we,

194
00:09:45.201 --> 00:09:48.740
we talked for awhile actually about, um, the friend that she was with,

195
00:09:48.741 --> 00:09:51.800
I think had given money to Hillary's campaign. And it was just so interesting.

196
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:52.880
The people are at this table.

197
00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.780
<v 0>Yeah. And then what actually the most interesting part was,</v>

198
00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.620
which we discovered when we got into the car to leave, I said to you, what,

199
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.540
what was what's standing out in your mind? And we,

200
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.540
and it was exactly what I saw, which was, I said to Trump,

201
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:09.020
something about Bloomberg and why I thought he was getting into the race.

202
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.770
And Trump turns to Melania, they're both sitting. We're S we're standing,

203
00:10:12.771 --> 00:10:15.590
you're standing across the table and I'm standing on this side and he puts his

204
00:10:15.591 --> 00:10:18.560
hand on her arm and he says, honey, what do you think about this?

205
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:23.240
And then he has me repeat my Bloomberg theory. And she was like, Oh,

206
00:10:23.241 --> 00:10:25.100
that's really interesting. That's really interesting. But what,

207
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.960
but what was really interesting about it was that he turned to her and the way

208
00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:33.560
he put his hand on her and the way she responded in honey,

209
00:10:33.561 --> 00:10:37.070
what do you think about this? Like, they actually love each other.

210
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.850
<v 1>It was so interesting to me because I was like, why haven't I seen this? Like,</v>

211
00:10:40.851 --> 00:10:42.710
it was very clear. They, they, in that room,

212
00:10:42.711 --> 00:10:45.170
they didn't have to put on a show for anybody. And I was like, these two people,

213
00:10:45.171 --> 00:10:47.520
definitely like each other, like a lot, like, right.

214
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:48.800
<v 0>His gut reaction.</v>

215
00:10:48.801 --> 00:10:52.150
When I said something interesting to him was let me turn to my wife, honey.

216
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.140
<v 1>What do you? Yeah, no, it was very interesting.</v>

217
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:56.260
<v 0>So when we got in the car after, that's what I said, what,</v>

218
00:10:56.261 --> 00:10:57.380
what was the thing that stood out? And yeah.

219
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.830
<v 1>As it, as it shouldn't be, but it's funny because, you know,</v>

220
00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.160
I don't believe a lot of the lies about him, but that with my own eyes,

221
00:11:04.161 --> 00:11:04.660
I've seen it.

222
00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.250
You've seen everyone seen those like famous pictures or videos where she's a

223
00:11:07.251 --> 00:11:10.310
little bit, you know, skiddish or standoffish from him. And I was like,

224
00:11:10.311 --> 00:11:12.770
I don't know. I guess, I don't know. It's interesting.
