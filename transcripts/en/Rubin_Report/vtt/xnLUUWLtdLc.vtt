1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.620
<v 0>It's an expensive place to be.</v>

2
00:00:01.621 --> 00:00:05.580
Let me tell you my income's down 30%, you know,

3
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.360
they're just things I can't do because I'm associated with saying something too

4
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:10.194
nice about it.

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.550
<v 2>That's when I first met you, you weren't even a Trump supporter at the time,</v>

6
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.580
you were just sort of talking about the techniques he was using.

7
00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:25.430
And just because of that, everyone said, Oh,

8
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.610
Scott Adams is mad guy he's far right. All of that nonsense,

9
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.310
not that you were supporting some of his policies necessarily,

10
00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:35.240
but you were just saying, this is how he is doing these things.

11
00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:38.390
This is how he is gaining a following and getting his message out. Right.

12
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.700
<v 0>Um, um, I identify as left of Bernie. So I still do now.</v>

13
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.690
I still do because socially, uh, you know, I could give you some examples,

14
00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:49.910
but socially I do. But what I,

15
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.030
what I eventually saw in Trump is they had a,

16
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.970
a toolkit that I thought could just do stuff.

17
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.380
Other people wouldn't do take on China. That's the toolkit you want,

18
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.140
uh, be the best cheerleader for the economy.

19
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.860
Literally get our psychology work in the right direction. Hey,

20
00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:09.350
everything's good. Everything's good. Why don't you invest? Okay.

21
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.390
That's the psychology of the economy.

22
00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:15.470
I thought nobody's going to do that as well as him. Um, and likewise,

23
00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:18.290
North Korea, I thought who could, who could have a meeting? Well,

24
00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:20.990
before it happened, I already written about it. I said,

25
00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:24.650
who could have the meeting with Kim Jong-un and just turn this personal,

26
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.260
maybe find a way in president Trump.

27
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.640
So I'm a supporter in terms of his toolkit, but you know,

28
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.350
it doesn't mean I agree with everything he does.

29
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.140
<v 2>Yeah. That's a hard place to be in though. Right?</v>

30
00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:38.990
Because people don't really care for that second part of that sentence.

31
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.660
<v 0>It's an expensive place to be. Let me tell you, because my income's down 30%,</v>

32
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.140
you know,

33
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.890
they're just things I can't do because I'm associated with saying something too

34
00:01:48.891 --> 00:01:50.060
nice about his skill.

35
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.860
<v 2>You talk about that a little bit more.</v>

36
00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:56.300
Like what kind of business things have dried up or, or even personal friends,

37
00:01:56.301 --> 00:01:58.070
or I don't want to say specifically or where you live,

38
00:01:58.071 --> 00:01:59.540
but you do live in California. I mean,

39
00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:04.100
you live in a place that is maybe not so hospitable to some of these ideas.

40
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.540
<v 0>Let's just say, uh,</v>

41
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.860
there was a rebuilding period where I had to make new friends, a lot of them,

42
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.580
you know.

43
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.740
<v 2>What phase of that building process are you in right now?</v>

44
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.880
<v 0>You know, I'm living a very good life with my girlfriend, Christina,</v>

45
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.480
we're quite happy with the way things are. So I don't have a complaint there.

46
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.970
It's just an observation that is socially.

47
00:02:22.971 --> 00:02:25.850
It became very difficult to have the same friends.

48
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.783
<v 2>What was that like?</v>

49
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.870
Cause I think everyone watching this has been through that to some degree. My,

50
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.060
my book is, is about that.

51
00:02:32.061 --> 00:02:35.930
It's about what happens as you start sort of coming out of the political closet

52
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.870
that you sort of get thrown under the bus by people that you thought were your

53
00:02:38.871 --> 00:02:41.720
friends, next thing you know, there's this whole other crew that's welcoming.

54
00:02:41.721 --> 00:02:44.600
You it's. I mean, it really is sort of a flip on everything, you know? Yeah.

55
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.250
<v 0>Only, only my most, uh,</v>

56
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.150
let's say honest friends were willing to say it to my face and that only

57
00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:50.990
happened a few times,

58
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.590
but mostly I just noticed that my Facebook feed started to getting,

59
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.680
it was getting emptier and emptier. I'd be like, huh,

60
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.720
really only one picture was all this week by all, everybody I know that's weird.

61
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:06.130
And then you see that they've unfriended you and then you check their feeds and

62
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:09.550
you see what their political leaning is. You put two plus two together.

63
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.190
<v 2>Then here we are. Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.480
How does your background in persuasion and magic and the

65
00:03:15.481 --> 00:03:19.560
cartoon and everything sort of fit your, your general demeanor?

66
00:03:19.561 --> 00:03:22.500
I said to you right before we started that, you're one of the few people that I,

67
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.940
that I now know that when I see them on Twitter, I don't like them less.

68
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.740
There are so many people that I know that,

69
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.470
and we all are not necessarily our best selves on,

70
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.800
on Twitter and online in general. But I see so many people that like,

71
00:03:34.801 --> 00:03:37.260
I kind of respect or I know. And um,

72
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.590
and then I look at their Twitter and I'm like, Ooh, what, what is going on here?

73
00:03:40.591 --> 00:03:42.450
And I'm sure there's people that say that about me too,

74
00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:45.900
but you seem like you're pretty like pretty much the same in both worlds.

75
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.260
<v 0>Fair. There were a lot of people look at my Twitter and say,</v>

76
00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:52.500
you're the worst person in the world I used to like your comic,

77
00:03:52.501 --> 00:03:56.220
but now I can never laugh again. Just in general. I can never laugh again.

78
00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.790
<v 2>Taking away their ability, not just to laugh at you, but the whole thing.</v>

79
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.290
<v 0>Have you noticed that the humor has just completely changed</v>

80
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.420
as has been said? You can't make a movie, a funny movie, a funny TV show.

81
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.081
In fact,

82
00:04:10.081 --> 00:04:13.620
if you watch like an old family guy rerun the whole time I'm sitting there

83
00:04:13.621 --> 00:04:14.880
thinking you couldn't make that.

84
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.640
<v 2>Couldn't do that. One could do that. One could do that one.</v>

85
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.590
<v 0>But humor has become a reality and politics and it's very</v>

86
00:04:22.591 --> 00:04:26.100
entertaining. And thankfully we have the funniest president we've ever had.

87
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.390
<v 2>So as a satirist though, what do you make of the comedy side of this?</v>

88
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.930
Cause you know, it's somebody like Seth McFarland who created family guy,

89
00:04:33.931 --> 00:04:35.970
you know, they've said, I don't know that they're going through with it,

90
00:04:35.971 --> 00:04:37.140
but I remember a few months back,

91
00:04:37.141 --> 00:04:40.170
they had said this thing where they're not going to do any more gay jokes.

92
00:04:40.171 --> 00:04:41.940
And it's like, well, the show did, you know,

93
00:04:41.941 --> 00:04:45.360
25 years of gay jokes and now gays are equal.

94
00:04:45.361 --> 00:04:47.850
So this might be the time to make a joke. So you can, you know,

95
00:04:47.851 --> 00:04:51.150
further integrate people into society. That's what Don Rickles did. Right.

96
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.090
It brought us all together. Um, or, or the Simpsons, you know,

97
00:04:54.091 --> 00:04:56.940
they were going to take out our poo for a while. And then Hank Azaria,

98
00:04:56.941 --> 00:05:01.530
the greatest voiceover actor of all time had to apologize for doing an Indian

99
00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:05.700
accent. What do you make of the, not just the content, but the people behind it,

100
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.320
you know, they'd been infected.

101
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.730
<v 0>I'm generally okay.</v>

102
00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:13.560
With the concept that society moves forward and things that we used to laugh

103
00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:17.970
at, we didn't realize were cruel. And then maybe you grow up and say, Oh,

104
00:05:17.971 --> 00:05:20.720
that was really meaner than it needed to be. What was it?

105
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.530
Wasn't really trying to do that. Uh, and so I'm okay with society evolving,

106
00:05:25.531 --> 00:05:27.480
but the trouble is, it evolved away.

107
00:05:27.481 --> 00:05:30.120
All the things that were the normal joke materials.

108
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.810
Now it didn't affect me with Dilbert because when you're in a family newspaper,

109
00:05:33.811 --> 00:05:35.940
there's, you know, there's a cap on what you can do.

110
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.350
So I was always well in the family friendly version and talking about the

111
00:05:40.351 --> 00:05:42.210
workplace. So it didn't affect me much,

112
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.350
but it certainly changed the landscape of humor probably forever. Yeah.

113
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.010
<v 2>Do you feel freer because I think you said to me last time you were here that</v>

114
00:05:50.011 --> 00:05:54.570
you you've got some F-you money so that you can kind of be free enough to do

115
00:05:54.571 --> 00:05:55.404
what you want.

116
00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.050
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, I didn't think it would be expensive as it was. Maybe,</v>

117
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.010
maybe I would have thought it through, but no, it won't change my lifestyle.

118
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.540
And, uh,

119
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:10.160
I did recognize that I was in this unique position where I had something to

120
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:14.600
say that in my opinion was not biased. You know, it was just, Hey,

121
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:17.660
this is what I'm seeing. There's a little good. And there's a little bad here.

122
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:20.930
So I thought it was a unique niche, niche niche.

123
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.310
<v 2>I'll go with either one. Well, I'll take either one. I.</v>

124
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.500
<v 0>Shouldn't say words. I never said that out loud. I.</v>

125
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.350
<v 2>Would've said niche personally, but I would accept niche.</v>

126
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.320
<v 0>Uh, as I look at your lovely decorations here,</v>

127
00:06:32.321 --> 00:06:33.850
I think that you were probably right.

128
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.340
<v 2>I'm better suited to figure out the critic, the correct pronunciation,</v>

129
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.320
just like it fits somehow. I dunno. What do you make? Or just sort of how,

130
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.290
as a guy that, you know, you sort of came out of newspapers,

131
00:06:44.291 --> 00:06:48.640
as you said that now you use all of this stuff in a different way. You know,

132
00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:51.370
you sit in the morning, do you do it every morning? You do it pretty,

133
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.440
pretty much every morning, right? You get on Twitter.

134
00:06:53.441 --> 00:06:56.440
What do you have your phone just like locked on something and you make yourself

135
00:06:56.441 --> 00:07:00.010
some coffee and you just kind of talk to the world that that's a big transition

136
00:07:00.011 --> 00:07:01.150
from, you know,

137
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.470
putting a cartoon in the paper and letting it be okay versus this fully a

138
00:07:05.471 --> 00:07:06.304
directive thing.

139
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.960
<v 0>Yeah. The difference is it's all. Yes.</v>

140
00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:11.770
I do coffee with Scott Adams on the Periscope app every day. And then,

141
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.980
then it moves over to YouTube at about an hour later on replay.

142
00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:20.680
But I started doing it cause I was just interested in the election

143
00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:23.080
and there were people to talk to and I had more to say,

144
00:07:23.081 --> 00:07:25.180
and I didn't feel like writing it all down all the time.

145
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.700
Cause every day there'd be three new things to talk about.

146
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:33.130
And then it just grew. I wasn't, I didn't really have any expectation, no plan.

147
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.690
Wasn't planning to even monetize it. Uh, it just grew into a thing.

148
00:07:37.691 --> 00:07:41.230
And now if I miss a day because I do it on a weekend and Stu holidays,

149
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.310
cause people are so addicted to having the simultaneous sip as I call it.

150
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:50.530
So I do a toast of coffee with the public and that they

151
00:07:50.531 --> 00:07:55.300
miss it. And so now it's sort of labor of love. Um, I would really,

152
00:07:55.301 --> 00:07:58.960
really miss it like this morning, my wifi wasn't working so well.

153
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:00.910
And I was like, ah, I don't know if I could do it,

154
00:08:00.911 --> 00:08:04.420
but I got my hotspot working and then it made me happy. Right? Like most,

155
00:08:04.421 --> 00:08:05.920
most awarded at it from here.

156
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.850
We wouldn't let you in rather than great most work. Doesn't make you happy.

157
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.550
You know, you might like your job, but it doesn't make you happy.

158
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.610
Whereas doing the Periscopes, it's just a joy every day.

159
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.440
<v 2>Yeah. I actually did it one morning.</v>

160
00:08:17.441 --> 00:08:20.850
I did coffee with Dave and I did fully credit. You rip the coffee idea.

161
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.780
No one was talking with coffee before you,

162
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.630
but I did think that there was something nice about just starting the day.

163
00:08:25.631 --> 00:08:30.100
Just sort of unloading a couple of thoughts, just, just that in and of itself.

164
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:31.630
I thought it was kind of refreshing.

165
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.250
<v 0>Yeah. And it has the, uh,</v>

166
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:37.930
unintended consequence that I often frame things before people wake up.

167
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.690
So if there's something that happens, say in the afternoon,

168
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.810
the pundits and people haven't had much time to deal with it.

169
00:08:43.811 --> 00:08:46.600
And sometimes I'm the first person they hear saying, well,

170
00:08:46.601 --> 00:08:49.720
the way to look at this is this is important. And this isn't,

171
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.540
and then somewhat accidentally I became influential.

172
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.030
<v 2>Do you think that's sort of your primary skill,</v>

173
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.350
like a sort of framing of the craziness and what we're obviously going to get to

174
00:08:58.351 --> 00:08:59.101
the book in a little bit,

175
00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:02.160
but I think that's sort of what you're doing is you're helping people frame

176
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.540
through just like this endless onslaught of information.

177
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.520
<v 0>So I often say I have one superpower,</v>

178
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:11.750
so I've got one super power and then a bunch of like supporting talents that

179
00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:15.950
I've tried to piece together over time, the super power is simplification.

180
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.890
Uh, I'm just a really good simplifier,

181
00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:22.760
which is what makes one a cartoonist cartoon is by its definition.

182
00:09:22.761 --> 00:09:27.380
The simplest thing you can put in this little panel. So if you can simplify,

183
00:09:27.381 --> 00:09:30.500
you can frame because it's taking down all the noise,

184
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.090
focusing on the thing that mattered.

185
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.880
So I naturally have that skill as a simplifier.

186
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.241
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

187
00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:37.760
It's kind of funny because that's almost the reverse of what everyone else is

188
00:09:37.761 --> 00:09:39.410
doing. And this sort of is what the book is about.

189
00:09:39.411 --> 00:09:42.980
Like everyone else is pretending they know everything about everything all day

190
00:09:42.981 --> 00:09:43.814
long, you know,

191
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.600
people who can't tie their shoes can tell you about climate change and you know,

192
00:09:47.601 --> 00:09:48.950
the rest of it. So it's like,

193
00:09:48.951 --> 00:09:52.610
you're sort of doing the reverse of what seemingly most of the blue check a

194
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.103
Twitterati.

195
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.680
<v 0>You, you should ignore anybody who has a sense of complete certainty about a</v>

196
00:09:57.681 --> 00:10:02.330
complicated issue, you know, unless they're a surgeon and it's their domain.

197
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.770
But if it's just a guy on Twitter talking about climate change or the,

198
00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.850
I don't know, trade with China, I don't know.

199
00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:15.470
<v 2>How do you figure out who you kind of can listen to or make some sense out of or</v>

200
00:10:15.471 --> 00:10:16.190
something like that?

201
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:17.960
<v 0>I just helped a little, everybody.</v>

202
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.340
I find the only way to look at all the windows is you've got to like figure out

203
00:10:22.341 --> 00:10:23.390
what everybody's saying.

204
00:10:23.391 --> 00:10:28.340
And then maybe you've got a little bit of a ability to determine which one

205
00:10:28.341 --> 00:10:29.174
is more sensitive.

206
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.480
<v 2>If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics</v>

207
00:10:32.481 --> 00:10:35.840
