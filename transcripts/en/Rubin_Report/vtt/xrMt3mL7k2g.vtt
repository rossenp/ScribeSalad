00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.050
<v 1>What up people I'm Dave Rubin. This is the Rubin report direct message for</v>

2
00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:15.380
October 22nd, 2020,

3
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.540
and tonight get ready. It's the, what should have been third debate,

4
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.630
but it's the second debate because they canceled the third debate. That's right.

5
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.060
77 year old Joe Biden versus 74 year

6
00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:33.380
old Donald Trump who will lead us into the new world.

7
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.520
We'll find out. Uh, yeah, we got a debate tonight. Um,

8
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.740
we'll see what happens. We're going to get into that.

9
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.680
It's going to be interesting. They're changing around some of the rules. Uh,

10
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.900
they just basically all make it up on the fly.

11
00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:49.340
Pretty much anything they can figure out to do to, to help Biden the Democrat.

12
00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:51.470
Obviously they do. In this case,

13
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.830
they're changing up something related to muting microphones to stop

14
00:00:54.831 --> 00:00:59.360
interruptions. It's all just sort of silly tomfoolery and trickery. Uh,

15
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.390
so we're going to talk about that. And then a quick reminder, everybody,

16
00:01:02.391 --> 00:01:06.770
I will be live tonight right here in this very room, uh,

17
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.470
with tequila. I think we're going to do it with tequila tonight.

18
00:01:09.471 --> 00:01:12.260
It seems like more of a tequila night. I've been doing the other, uh,

19
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.520
debates with whiskey, but I think we're going to do a nice sipping tequila. Uh,

20
00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:18.950
so we'll be live at seven 30 Pacific.

21
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.920
That's a 10 30 Eastern time and, uh,

22
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.130
doing a live stream with the reaction and we'll have some clips and all that

23
00:01:25.131 --> 00:01:28.160
good stuff. And then right after that, I'll be joining, uh,

24
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.640
Glenn Beck on the blades. So if you ain't sick of me, yo,

25
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.230
we'll be by the end of the day. All right.

26
00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:37.040
So we're going to talk about the debate. Some, uh, some expectations,

27
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:38.090
what I think is going to happen,

28
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.250
what I think each one of these guys needs to do today to accomplish. And,

29
00:01:42.251 --> 00:01:42.890
and again,

30
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.840
it's all about just the people who still haven't made the decision.

31
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.620
Those are the only people that really matter for a debate. At this point,

32
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.590
we've got a lot of people that know exactly what they're going to do so they can

33
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.230
go. I'm sure it's for my guy or I don't like that guy,

34
00:01:57.231 --> 00:02:01.220
but this really is just about, can you move anybody else through a debate?

35
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.090
I actually do think there are a certain amount, a decent amount.

36
00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:09.890
I would say of people that still can be moved, but before we get to all that,

37
00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:12.080
I want to talk to you about second thoughts,

38
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.720
the game I've got it right here in my hands. People.

39
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.740
Second thoughts is the quick thinking verse fast-talking party game.

40
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.970
Second thoughts is this year's new favorite party game that is sure to be a hit

41
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.430
with your friends and your family on game night.

42
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.430
It has been a hit with my friends. I haven't seen my family because of COVID.

43
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.360
We're working on that.

44
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.990
The play of the game calls for each team to quickly create a list of words for

45
00:02:32.991 --> 00:02:34.310
their opponents to decipher,

46
00:02:34.311 --> 00:02:38.840
leading to hilarious puzzlement and laughter simply put it's a classical word

47
00:02:38.841 --> 00:02:43.370
game with a unique twist that allows players to personalize the content with

48
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:46.850
their voluminous sense of word smithery or just their witty and warped

49
00:02:46.851 --> 00:02:47.684
imaginations.

50
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.140
Each round of second thoughts is a hilarious high-speed attempt to stump.

51
00:02:51.141 --> 00:02:51.974
The other team.

52
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.490
Both teams create a list of five things using the letters revealed from the

53
00:02:55.491 --> 00:02:57.320
color dice, be witty and wise,

54
00:02:57.321 --> 00:03:00.160
but don't take too long because time not on your side,

55
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.790
the amount of time it takes your team to create the list is exactly how much

56
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:06.930
time you were uploading. Get to guess them second thoughts.

57
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.260
The quick thinking fast-talking party game.

58
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.770
I think I did pretty good there on the fast talking part. And by the way, guys,

59
00:03:13.771 --> 00:03:15.750
the creators are second thoughts are fans of the show.

60
00:03:15.751 --> 00:03:20.280
So that is how you can show a little love to people who are putting some good

61
00:03:20.281 --> 00:03:23.580
stuff out into the universe. Okay? It's being good pudding,

62
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.900
good stuff out to the universe.

63
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.000
<v 2>The debate is tonight, but.</v>

64
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.950
<v 1>Before I get to the debate, I want to do one other thing.</v>

65
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.870
I realized that I've been doing this show for quite some time. About two months,

66
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.410
I've been talking directly to you and obviously you're spending most of your

67
00:03:37.411 --> 00:03:40.860
days telling people how much you love Dave Rubin and how great he is.

68
00:03:40.861 --> 00:03:42.450
And the direct message is amazing.

69
00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:44.940
And the interviews are fantastic and he's got the funniest,

70
00:03:44.941 --> 00:03:48.480
Twitter and all of those things. But despite all of that,

71
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.080
I never told you guys what my preferred pronouns are.

72
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.480
So I don't even know how you're referring to me. And I assume in,

73
00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:59.880
in probably some offensive ways, ways that that would be really upsetting.

74
00:03:59.881 --> 00:04:00.630
If I heard them,

75
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.440
I want to just get my pronouns out my preferred pronouns so that when you tell

76
00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:08.250
people you love that Dave Rubin, you know exactly how to refer to me.

77
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.230
So to be very clear, my preferred pronouns,

78
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.530
he him Lord count master prime,

79
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.940
general commander [inaudible]. Those are my preferred pronouns.

80
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.790
You can refer to me as any of those. And if you don't,

81
00:04:20.791 --> 00:04:24.360
I will report you to the proper authorities. Okay, guys,

82
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.800
let's talk debate it's tonight. As I said,

83
00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:30.750
it was supposed to be the third debate.

84
00:04:30.751 --> 00:04:33.480
It's only the second debate because they canceled the middle of debate.

85
00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:38.040
After Trump came down with Corona and although he was already healthy at that

86
00:04:38.041 --> 00:04:38.730
point,

87
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.650
they were going to do it over Skype or over zoom or over these electronic pipes

88
00:04:43.651 --> 00:04:45.270
that we do all this stuff through.

89
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.810
But the Trump side didn't want to do it because they felt that would be giving

90
00:04:48.811 --> 00:04:50.220
Biden an unfair advantage,

91
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.460
because he could have somebody talking in the IFB that's the earpiece,

92
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.900
or he could be getting information off a teleprompter or have people with cue

93
00:04:57.901 --> 00:05:00.120
cards or anything else. So they backed out of it,

94
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.450
which you could debate either way, whether that was good or bad. I mean,

95
00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:07.200
Trump didn't have the greatest first debate, right? I mean, even,

96
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.840
even his most ardent supporters, he was a little too jumpy,

97
00:05:09.841 --> 00:05:13.710
a little too combative. He also was debating two on one, for sure. Chris,

98
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.060
Chris Wallace obviously, uh, is, is going Biden, uh,

99
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.690
or at least leaning in that direction. And it seems like all these media people,

100
00:05:21.691 --> 00:05:24.690
every time they try to be impartial, they seem to secretly,

101
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.260
although not so secretly have to prove to all of their liberal friends that

102
00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:30.840
they're just not really a scary Republican, right?

103
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.650
So they always end up going more against the Republican and conservative.

104
00:05:34.651 --> 00:05:37.110
And you know, I I've said this many times,

105
00:05:37.111 --> 00:05:41.460
but that in a weird way is the essence of the Trump campaign. That for,

106
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.350
for all time, or at least in modern time. So let's say the last 50 years or so,

107
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.950
uh,

108
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.330
it's been the Republican people think it's the Republican versus the Democrat,

109
00:05:51.331 --> 00:05:55.110
but really what it is, it's the Republican versus the Democrat and the media.

110
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.740
And if you think about it mean, so think about it.

111
00:05:57.741 --> 00:06:02.420
You had a Barack Obama and Barack Obama and the media versus John

112
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:06.620
McCain, who we were told was a racist and a hated women.

113
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:07.670
And the same thing,

114
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:12.260
it was Barack Obama and the media versus Mitt Romney and binders full of

115
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:15.440
women. And all of that stuff. Trump is the one who said, okay,

116
00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:19.460
I'll fight you guys. And I'll basically take you out as the media.

117
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.960
So in essence, what has to happen tonight here? Here's my, uh, my prediction.

118
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.610
Oh, and by the way, I should say, we will be live immediately after the bait,

119
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.230
the debate, we might start a minute or two, uh, before the debate ends, uh,

120
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.600
because I know everybody's watching and then they suddenly figure out where are

121
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:36.950
we going to watch the post-game wrap up?

122
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.870
And then they're jumping around and we might start a minute or two early,

123
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:43.790
but at seven 30 Pacific time, we are here in crazy Los Angeles.

124
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.110
Uh, we will be going live right here on the YouTube, uh,

125
00:06:47.111 --> 00:06:49.100
and I'll be going for about 40 minutes or so.

126
00:06:49.101 --> 00:06:52.400
And then I'm going to be jumping over and talking to Glenn Beck, uh, Glenn,

127
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:55.430
back on the blaze. Uh, so you can catch the wrap up. Oh,

128
00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:58.310
and I think I have to think about it throughout the day,

129
00:06:58.311 --> 00:07:02.720
but I think that I will be doing this with a little sipping tequila tonight.

130
00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:05.730
I've done the other debates, the first presidential one and the,

131
00:07:05.731 --> 00:07:09.170
the VP debate with, uh, with whiskey, which I have enjoyed.

132
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:11.360
And I think you guys have enjoyed watching me drink it,

133
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.220
but I think we're going to go with tequila tonight.

134
00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:17.720
Something about tonight since it's the last one, it reads tequila to me.

135
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.570
So I think it's going to be a tequila tequila at night. So anyway,

136
00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:23.000
make sure you're subscribed to our channel and you click that notification bell

137
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:27.080
so that you can see the live stream later. And now allow me to, uh,

138
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.580
lay out a couple of things about the debate.

139
00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:33.370
So first off the debate moderator is Kristin Welker. And, uh,

140
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.170
from everything I can see, she's going to be pretty non-partisan except for,

141
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:42.700
and this is exactly what I was talking about a moment ago, her history,

142
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.020
well, I'll read it to you. She was previously registered to vote as a Democrat,

143
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:51.580
but since 2016 has been registered in Washington DC with no party affiliation.

144
00:07:51.581 --> 00:07:54.760
Now that doesn't necessarily mean anything.

145
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.590
I I've told you guys me here in California, I'm registered as a Democrat.

146
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.450
Not because I am a Democrat,

147
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:06.580
but because I wanted to be able to vote in these past primaries so that I could

148
00:08:06.581 --> 00:08:08.290
vote against Bernie Sanders.

149
00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:12.970
So I actually voted for Joe Biden in the primaries because I

150
00:08:12.971 --> 00:08:15.430
thought that Bernie Sanders was the bigger threat. Now,

151
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:16.900
the irony of that of course,

152
00:08:16.901 --> 00:08:21.730
is that all of the horrific ideas of big government and taking whatever you want

153
00:08:21.731 --> 00:08:24.370
from the people and giving it to whoever else you want to give it to,

154
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.540
that all is being imported through the Biden campaign. But, uh, you know, it's,

155
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.600
it's coming from the Bernie movement and it's being imported through Biden,

156
00:08:31.601 --> 00:08:34.330
right? Biden's just the shell for the thing. Um, but I,

157
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:39.220
but I felt at least there would be the semblance of something sort of

158
00:08:39.221 --> 00:08:42.040
remotely close to an old Democrat if you got Biden.

159
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.070
And I still think that is somewhat true, but, but barely true.

160
00:08:45.071 --> 00:08:48.460
I just thought Biden would be better than getting the full on grotesque,

161
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.560
socialist lunacy of, of Bernie Sanders. And I think a lot of people did that.

162
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.060
So, so the point of that though,

163
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.020
is that her party affiliation doesn't necessarily mean anything.

164
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.090
She may have had her own considerations,

165
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:04.740
but my guess is she probably is more of a Democrat than a Republican.

166
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:06.330
So that's one thing to talk about. Uh,

167
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.990
the topics for tonight are sort of interesting and, uh,

168
00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.200
and particularly interesting because they're leaving one out that we have not

169
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.270
talked about at all.

170
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.090
And I think Trump really needs to bring up one way or another tonight.

171
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:22.530
The topics for tonight are going to be, COVID-19 obviously American families,

172
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.010
uh, not family guy, American families race in America,

173
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.810
because we don't talk about that enough climate change because apparently we can

174
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:34.020
fix the climate. We Americans, we can do anything, uh,

175
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.060
national security and leadership.

176
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.170
Now the one that's missing there and the Trump campaign is not happy about this

177
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.030
is foreign policy. And this is,

178
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.330
this is super interesting to me because none of the debates,

179
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.220
the first presidential debate,

180
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:51.510
nor the VP debate had anything to do with foreign policy,

181
00:09:51.511 --> 00:09:53.730
like it pretty much has not been touched.

182
00:09:53.731 --> 00:09:57.030
There's been a mention of Russia here or there. Uh, but,

183
00:09:57.031 --> 00:10:00.690
but pretty much nothing. And to me, this is a really bizarre one that,

184
00:10:00.691 --> 00:10:03.930
that the Trump people are letting slide because he's ending the war in

185
00:10:03.931 --> 00:10:05.340
Afghanistan, right? At this point,

186
00:10:05.341 --> 00:10:09.480
I think he said that all of our troops will be out by Christmas. Uh,

187
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.640
there might be a couple people left,

188
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:15.680
but basically ending the longest war in American history.

189
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.660
Did you know that the Afghanistan war,

190
00:10:17.661 --> 00:10:21.410
which nobody has really clear why we went into in the first place and has now

191
00:10:21.411 --> 00:10:26.090
been going on since what, since late 2001 or 2002,

192
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.920
I mean, basically at 18 year war,

193
00:10:27.921 --> 00:10:30.500
the longest war in American history is about to come to a close.

194
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:35.090
That is because of Donald Trump ending that war. Um, so that's number one,

195
00:10:35.091 --> 00:10:38.630
number two, uh, you know, uh, you guys know I'm old school.

196
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.520
And I thought that one thing that everyone agreed on is that we want peace in

197
00:10:43.521 --> 00:10:44.354
the middle East.

198
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.140
That seemed to be a good thing that we wanted Israel and the Arab countries to

199
00:10:48.141 --> 00:10:51.890
be at peace. Well, there were the Abraham Accords, uh, about a month.

200
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:56.690
What was that two months ago now? And, uh, the UAE, the United Arab Emirates,

201
00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.800
uh, and, and Israel are now at peace.

202
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.980
They have a piece of paper that says that they're in peace.

203
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:05.540
This is a good thing,

204
00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:09.110
that there are all sorts of rumors that other countries will get onboard.

205
00:11:09.111 --> 00:11:11.990
This and that the Gulf States, even if they haven't officially said it,

206
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:15.380
that there's no reason to think that they're going to be at war with Israel.

207
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.340
There's trade already starting. I mean, this is, this is real stuff.

208
00:11:19.341 --> 00:11:21.980
This could reach Saudi Arabia and it's,

209
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:26.840
it's a complete flip actually on the way everyone viewed the middle East that

210
00:11:26.841 --> 00:11:30.140
you'd have to solve the Palestinian thing first, but actually it's being proven.

211
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.730
You can do it in another way.

212
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.640
So that has a little something to do with Donald Trump.

213
00:11:34.641 --> 00:11:36.140
You would think he would want to talk about that.

214
00:11:36.141 --> 00:11:39.380
You would think he would want to talk about moving the American embassy to

215
00:11:39.381 --> 00:11:40.940
Jerusalem, et cetera, et cetera.

216
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.060
So the fact that they are doing nothing on foreign policy here,

217
00:11:44.061 --> 00:11:48.680
the fact that he's got other countries actually paying more of their fair share

218
00:11:48.681 --> 00:11:52.790
on things, you might also want to talk about foreign policy because, uh,

219
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:57.400
we probably talk about that China place, right. Or China as he calls it.

220
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.870
Um, so it's just very bizarre that we're going to go through two presidential

221
00:12:01.871 --> 00:12:04.780
debates, one vice-presidential debate, and we,

222
00:12:04.781 --> 00:12:07.120
ain't going to talk about foreign policy at all. So I,

223
00:12:07.121 --> 00:12:10.360
I hope that Trump throws in a little something there, um,

224
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:14.140
because I think that's, that's a win for him. It just, it just strikes me as a,

225
00:12:14.141 --> 00:12:17.890
as a total win. So that's, that's something there. Uh,

226
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.720
but then here's the key to this thing.

227
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.960
And this is where the rules are just changed.

228
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:26.530
It seems like we have nothing anymore that is consistent.

229
00:12:26.531 --> 00:12:29.170
Like you could wake up any day in. Anything could be changed.

230
00:12:29.171 --> 00:12:31.750
Any rule in the past could be changed in anything else. Well,

231
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:36.670
the debate commission has decided to adopt a new rule that they did not

232
00:12:36.671 --> 00:12:40.270
have a week ago, did not have two weeks ago or 20 years ago, uh,

233
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:43.090
to mute microphones for this final event.

234
00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:47.260
So basically when the question is asked to one of the candidates,

235
00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:51.070
they will have two minutes to respond and the other candidate is going to be

236
00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:55.720
muted for that. Now, clearly they're doing this to help Biden, right?

237
00:12:55.721 --> 00:12:57.880
Like the thought process. And I don't think it's going to work,

238
00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:01.480
but the thought process obviously is especially in the first debate,

239
00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.540
Trump was very jumpy and he kept interrupting and by the way,

240
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.930
bite and called him stupid and racist and all of that stuff too.

241
00:13:07.931 --> 00:13:10.090
So they were both doing it, but Trump was very jumpy.

242
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.950
And the idea I think by the commission is we've got to stop Trump from sort of

243
00:13:14.951 --> 00:13:18.940
taking over. So that I think was their intention. However,

244
00:13:18.941 --> 00:13:22.750
where does that road to hell come from? Where, what leads to it?

245
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:26.350
Good intentions right there. It will, I don't think these were good intentions,

246
00:13:26.351 --> 00:13:30.640
but these were their good intentions. Good intentions. I think in essence,

247
00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.610
what's going to happen here is that Trump made a mistake.

248
00:13:33.611 --> 00:13:37.000
I think in the last debate by continually interrupting Biden,

249
00:13:37.001 --> 00:13:38.590
because every time he interrupted Biden,

250
00:13:38.591 --> 00:13:42.820
Biden was able to reset and Biden seems to be able to

251
00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:45.010
respond. If you directly go at him,

252
00:13:45.011 --> 00:13:49.930
he can sort of reset and respond the idea that Biden supposedly off the

253
00:13:49.931 --> 00:13:50.920
cuff, uh,

254
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:55.750
supposedly without pre-written statements and not hearing anything or not

255
00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.490
on Adderall or whatever else, the idea that he can talk for two minutes,

256
00:14:00.491 --> 00:14:04.030
uninterrupted and make sense. I think they're going to regret this.

257
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.660
It seems to me that that would be the scariest thing for him at this point that

258
00:14:07.661 --> 00:14:10.030
this is, this is the thing that he really can't do.

259
00:14:10.031 --> 00:14:13.570
So I think they did it to help Biden. And I think they might find out that,

260
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:17.530
that it's not going to help item, but even putting that aside,

261
00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:22.720
I think the broader idea here is that these things are not really debates.

262
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:27.400
You know, I said it a couple of weeks ago, but what really would be better than,

263
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:29.320
than have even having a moderator.

264
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:33.460
Maybe you have a person there just to occasionally move it along is basically

265
00:14:33.461 --> 00:14:37.300
say to the two of them, okay, we've got these five, six topics.

266
00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:41.800
You've got 15 minutes each to, to start talking about them and,

267
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.410
and back and forth one can start and you've got, you know,

268
00:14:44.411 --> 00:14:48.100
you got like your two minute opener. The other guys got two minutes. And then,

269
00:14:48.101 --> 00:14:49.780
and then if that's four minutes,

270
00:14:49.781 --> 00:14:53.210
then you've got nine minutes of back and forth and just let them do it.

271
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:58.370
Just let them actually argue and exchange ideas,

272
00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.770
perhaps the same way that you might,

273
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.870
when you're talking about politics with people.

274
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.240
I think that's part of why the show,

275
00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:08.270
it feels like the show is sort of breaking down, doesn't it right?

276
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.930
Like we're at the end of when these debates are going to make any sense,

277
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:16.580
we're watching a 77 year old and a 74 year old argue in canned

278
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.070
pre-package statements. And it's like,

279
00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:22.430
you really can't get that much new information.

280
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:27.500
Which also is why I just think that this isn't about the winners and

281
00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:31.370
losers in that traditional sense that the media is going to frame it tomorrow.

282
00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:33.740
And I assure you, the media really,

283
00:15:33.741 --> 00:15:36.530
really wants by it into when this was not a good week for Biden.

284
00:15:36.531 --> 00:15:41.180
First off Biden has had a lid on the campaign since

285
00:15:41.181 --> 00:15:43.460
Monday morning. Now it's Thursday today.

286
00:15:43.461 --> 00:15:46.640
That means he hasn't done anything public since then. Uh,

287
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.900
Trump's been doing rallies,

288
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:51.740
thousands of people out there there's this whole Holly Hunter Biden laptop

289
00:15:51.741 --> 00:15:55.910
story, which now, uh, has been confirmed by the FBI,

290
00:15:55.911 --> 00:16:00.110
that it is Hunter Biden's laptop, uh, the New York post, by the way,

291
00:16:00.111 --> 00:16:01.430
which is the newspaper.

292
00:16:01.431 --> 00:16:04.460
It's one of the longest running newspapers in the hit in the history of the

293
00:16:04.461 --> 00:16:07.460
United States. They have been locked out of their Twitter account.

294
00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:11.870
As of me taping this right now for over six days because of putting the article

295
00:16:11.871 --> 00:16:16.760
out there. So this, this Hunter Biden story, it's not just about Hunter Biden,

296
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.940
his connections to Ukraine, how the Biden family profited from it.

297
00:16:19.941 --> 00:16:23.900
And that Joe Biden obviously knew about it in a weird way. I'm sort of like, Oh,

298
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.020
they're they're politicians and they're all kind of gross. And they,

299
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:28.940
they all do this stuff.

300
00:16:28.941 --> 00:16:31.700
And how did Biden get his big mansion on his government salary?

301
00:16:31.701 --> 00:16:35.180
And like all that kind of stuff. Like I expect them all to be corrupt.

302
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:39.180
I expect every single politician to be corrupt and use connections and,

303
00:16:39.181 --> 00:16:43.310
and all of those things. And, and in a weird way, anyone with that much power,

304
00:16:43.311 --> 00:16:46.430
including you watching this probably would do something similar.

305
00:16:46.431 --> 00:16:51.410
The idea that you could get through the system to get all the way up to be a,

306
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.610
a vice-president is, is, uh, you know,

307
00:16:55.611 --> 00:16:57.860
without being deeply, corrupt is pretty crazy.

308
00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:00.880
<v 3>But you know what, before we do all that, guys, I want to talk to you.</v>

309
00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.030
<v 1>About built bar. Okay. How was that for a transition?</v>

310
00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:09.430
Are you guys looking for a new protein bar that tastes like a candy bar? Well,

311
00:17:09.431 --> 00:17:11.740
I've got just the brand for you guys.

312
00:17:11.741 --> 00:17:14.920
Built bars are super tasty and coming 18 amazing flavors.

313
00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:19.690
My personal favorite is cookies and cream. I've got it right here and it,

314
00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:21.580
ladies and gentlemen is delicious.

315
00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.620
They're covered in a hundred percent chocolate,

316
00:17:23.621 --> 00:17:28.510
including both nut and nut-free flavors and soft and easy to chew with Halloween

317
00:17:28.511 --> 00:17:30.820
just around the corner. It's easy to slip up,

318
00:17:30.821 --> 00:17:34.000
which is why bill bars are the perfect alternative to candy for the health

319
00:17:34.001 --> 00:17:34.870
conscious guy.

320
00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:38.650
I can actually lose or maintain weight while indulging in a delicious treat,

321
00:17:38.651 --> 00:17:41.800
built bars or low calorie, low sugar, high protein,

325
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:58.640
<v 3>Boost at Outback to me. Hello. Um, okay,</v>

326
00:17:58.641 --> 00:18:01.760
so we can whittle all this down,

327
00:18:01.761 --> 00:18:04.370
I think in effect to those people in the middle, right?

328
00:18:04.371 --> 00:18:06.860
It's the people in the middle. And.

329
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:09.770
<v 1>Let me get back to, I was on a little Biden tangent there.</v>

330
00:18:09.771 --> 00:18:10.730
Let me continue with that.

331
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.800
This thing isn't about Hunter Biden and access and all of that.

332
00:18:15.801 --> 00:18:17.630
Now that there are legit issues there.

333
00:18:17.631 --> 00:18:20.030
And as I've been talking about in the DM for the last couple of days,

334
00:18:20.031 --> 00:18:24.470
there are plenty of mainstream people that are trying to pretend that it's a

335
00:18:24.471 --> 00:18:25.430
hoax and all that,

336
00:18:25.431 --> 00:18:28.670
the same people who were pushing a Russian hoax are now telling you something

337
00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.850
that the FBI is saying is true, uh, is,

338
00:18:31.851 --> 00:18:34.640
is a hoax because they don't like the direction it's going in.

339
00:18:34.641 --> 00:18:38.030
And that also goes back to this reality war that I've been talking about.

340
00:18:38.031 --> 00:18:40.910
It's like you pick a side, you see things when you want to see them.

341
00:18:40.911 --> 00:18:43.790
And you don't think you don't see things when, when you don't want to see them.

342
00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.290
So that that's one part of this,

343
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:48.920
but the idea that the New York post has been locked out of Twitter for six days,

344
00:18:48.921 --> 00:18:51.740
the idea that Twitter was stopping links, being from, uh,

345
00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.900
being put up and then get this one. I, you know,

346
00:18:53.901 --> 00:18:56.660
for those of you that are on Twitter, you, you're probably aware of this,

347
00:18:56.661 --> 00:18:58.430
but for those of you that aren't on Twitter and you're,

348
00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.270
you're happier people and you're better people. Um, this is an important little,

349
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:06.650
little tidbit that you should know about, even if you're not on Twitter, uh,

350
00:19:06.651 --> 00:19:09.260
which is that Twitter just in the last, like three days,

351
00:19:09.261 --> 00:19:11.090
they made it harder to retweet.

352
00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:14.840
So retweet obviously is when you just see something, you like,

353
00:19:14.841 --> 00:19:18.680
you press the retweet button and then it goes to all of your followers as well.

354
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.150
So the way this always worked,

355
00:19:20.151 --> 00:19:22.850
or at least for the last couple of years with Twitter,

356
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.950
was that you could just press a button and it would go,

357
00:19:24.951 --> 00:19:26.630
that would be a manual retweet.

358
00:19:26.631 --> 00:19:30.440
Or you could do sort of like a contextual retweet and that you could press a

359
00:19:30.441 --> 00:19:35.330
button. You could add some commentary and then also send out that message. Well,

360
00:19:35.331 --> 00:19:39.080
they decided just in the last couple of days to get rid of the manual one.

361
00:19:39.081 --> 00:19:43.670
So in effect you have to basically press it twice to send it out to your people

362
00:19:43.671 --> 00:19:47.120
without adding comment. I know this sort of sounds like insider nonsense.

363
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.100
Why am I even mentioning it? And why is it important?

364
00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.890
<v 3>Well, we know that.</v>

365
00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.650
<v 1>Tech is manipulating us at every level,</v>

366
00:19:54.651 --> 00:19:58.040
at every stage consistently and constantly. So why.

367
00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:02.600
<v 3>Is it that Twitter has worked one way for years and literally.</v>

368
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:03.890
<v 1>Two weeks before an election,</v>

369
00:20:03.891 --> 00:20:08.600
they make it harder or more confusing to send out a message to

370
00:20:08.601 --> 00:20:11.690
amplify a message you believe in. So when I saw it on my phone,

371
00:20:11.691 --> 00:20:14.420
the first time I thought my phone was having a glitch or something,

372
00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:15.890
cause they also didn't even send out a message.

373
00:20:15.891 --> 00:20:19.820
I happened to see that Jack Dorsey on Twitter, the CEO,

374
00:20:19.821 --> 00:20:21.650
he sent out one message about it, but,

375
00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:23.690
but if you didn't see that and then you're going, wait a minute,

376
00:20:23.691 --> 00:20:26.750
I can't retweet the way I used to. You might not know that something's there.

377
00:20:26.751 --> 00:20:30.620
And the reason they're doing that is they don't want certain information to

378
00:20:30.621 --> 00:20:32.510
travel as fast as it.

379
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.660
<v 3>Can, or it would with, with, you know,</v>

380
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:40.130
14 and now less days to an election. So I know that.

381
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:41.960
<v 1>That sounds like a little insider baseball stuff,</v>

382
00:20:41.961 --> 00:20:44.750
but these things are important. So when you can't post certain links,

383
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.640
because Twitter decides that you can't,

384
00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.530
and you can't post certain things on your Facebook feed because Facebook decides

385
00:20:50.531 --> 00:20:51.690
you can't and they're,

386
00:20:51.691 --> 00:20:55.780
they're telling us that it's all because of the way things are sourced or what's

387
00:20:55.781 --> 00:20:58.630
true where we're going to put a warning or the rest of it. It's like.

388
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.910
<v 3>You guys are obvious.</v>

389
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:04.960
<v 1>Liars and we all see it and we all get it. And in many ways,</v>

390
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:06.640
and I think this is what Trump.

391
00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:09.160
<v 3>Should hit and hit it hard tonight.</v>

392
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.480
<v 1>In many ways, this is what Trump is running against. More than Biden, Biden,</v>

393
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:17.890
Biden in effect is nothing like the Biden move.

394
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:21.910
The idea that there's like a Biden movement or what does Joe Biden's democratic

395
00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.090
party stand for? It stands for nothing. What it, what it is,

396
00:21:25.091 --> 00:21:28.240
is the placeholder for the far left to come in right behind it.

397
00:21:28.241 --> 00:21:29.950
Even if you look at Biden's Twitter account,

398
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.830
now it reads of just meaningless slogans.

399
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:36.970
That that is very much what Bernie's Twitter account has felt like for the last

400
00:21:36.971 --> 00:21:39.310
couple of years. So they've completely infected that thing.

401
00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.040
So if you're voting for Biden, it's like,

402
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.660
you either don't know what you're voting for,

403
00:21:43.661 --> 00:21:46.630
or you're not getting what you think you're voting for with Trump.

404
00:21:46.631 --> 00:21:49.720
I think this thing, this idea that I'm running against the media,

405
00:21:49.721 --> 00:21:51.910
but now I'm also running against big tech. It's like,

406
00:21:51.911 --> 00:21:55.420
that's real that I just see that as real. And you may, again,

407
00:21:55.421 --> 00:21:56.920
you may not like Trump and he uses,

408
00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:01.030
he uses a sledgehammer when sometimes he could, he could just, you know,

409
00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.110
push something in with his hands.

410
00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.100
<v 3>Or, um, but that's okay.</v>

411
00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.490
<v 1>When he pushes something in with his finger, he uses a sledgehammer. Instead,</v>

412
00:22:08.491 --> 00:22:11.700
he just, you know, tapping a nail, something like that. Um,

413
00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:13.141
you may not like that,

414
00:22:13.141 --> 00:22:16.350
but there's a reason like you could see what that reason is to vote for him.

415
00:22:16.351 --> 00:22:18.000
And that, that brings me to something that I'll,

416
00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:21.510
I think I'll probably close on for today because I've been thinking this

417
00:22:21.511 --> 00:22:24.810
through, I've been sort of working this, this theory through,

418
00:22:24.811 --> 00:22:26.250
in my head over the last little bit,

419
00:22:26.251 --> 00:22:27.870
and I've wanted to kind of put it out there.

420
00:22:27.871 --> 00:22:31.680
So I want you guys to hopefully hear this and think about it for yourselves and

421
00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:34.110
let me know what you thought, what you think about it. Uh,

422
00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.720
and as I always tell you, you can jump in@rubinreport.com.

423
00:22:36.721 --> 00:22:38.760
If you want to engage with me directly, Oh, by the way,

424
00:22:38.761 --> 00:22:39.780
during the debate tonight,

425
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:45.090
I will be live chatting@rubinreport.com and you can download our iOS or

426
00:22:45.091 --> 00:22:48.810
Google play app if you want to jump into live chat with me. Um,

427
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.710
but I will end on this thought, I've been thinking about something and, uh,

428
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.820
and it, it basically, it goes like this.

429
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:58.710
<v 3>That Trump at this point, as crazy as it sounds,</v>

430
00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:02.550
this orange hair plugged, man, this.

431
00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:06.060
<v 1>Corrupt New York city businessman, who's been around forever. Who,</v>

432
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.800
who was in home alone too,

433
00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:13.080
and used to be interviewed by David Letterman and had an a reality show on NBC.

434
00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:17.880
And now has been turned into a Nazi by the media. That in an odd way,

435
00:23:17.881 --> 00:23:22.440
I think you can argue that he's not only saving conservatism,

436
00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:26.750
but he's saving liberalism. This is a really weird theory here, but,

437
00:23:26.751 --> 00:23:29.630
but hear me out on this. So how is he saving conservatism? Well,

438
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.870
that's pretty obvious, right?

439
00:23:30.871 --> 00:23:35.070
Like with the judges that he's putting on board with the economic policy he has

440
00:23:35.071 --> 00:23:36.030
with the foreign policy,

441
00:23:36.031 --> 00:23:40.470
as I think most people would say he's governing Mo in a more conservative way

442
00:23:40.471 --> 00:23:45.440
than he himself probably is. Right. I don't think he's act key. Personally.

443
00:23:45.441 --> 00:23:49.520
Donald Trump is probably as conservative as he's governing.

444
00:23:49.521 --> 00:23:51.140
So I think I don't have to spend too much time on this.

445
00:23:51.141 --> 00:23:52.340
I think most of you understand that,

446
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:57.410
that he is a modern conservative and that he's governing

447
00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:01.970
as a conservative, so, okay. That's how he's saving conservatism. And also,

448
00:24:01.971 --> 00:24:05.750
I should also say that in the face of critical race theory and social justice

449
00:24:05.751 --> 00:24:06.560
and everything else,

450
00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.670
he's fighting against that because he's trying to conserve some of the

451
00:24:10.671 --> 00:24:13.940
traditional American beliefs and patriotism and things of that nature.

452
00:24:13.941 --> 00:24:15.650
So that's, that makes him a conservative.

453
00:24:15.651 --> 00:24:17.840
I think that probably seems obvious to most people,

454
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:19.610
but now how is he saving liberal.

455
00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.170
<v 3>Well, liberalism, as you guys know, as I've.</v>

456
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.920
<v 1>Talked about endlessly and then wrote a book about and everything else,</v>

457
00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.460
when I talk about the good remaining liberals of,

458
00:24:29.461 --> 00:24:33.700
of which there are not that many anymore liberalism in its classical sense in

459
00:24:33.701 --> 00:24:36.790
its true sense. And when most people said they were liberals.

460
00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:41.380
<v 3>Until the last couple of years, what they meant was they're social.</v>

461
00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:43.360
<v 1>Chilly, liberal, that you can do what you want.</v>

462
00:24:43.361 --> 00:24:45.640
You can smoke what you want and marry what you want, blah, blah, blah.

463
00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:50.140
And then they meant some sort of fiscally conservative that was sort of the old

464
00:24:50.141 --> 00:24:54.040
school that was the blue dog Democrat. Um, that was,

465
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:58.060
that was what most, that's what bill Clinton would have purported to be. Uh,

466
00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:02.350
and most liberals were, that's very different than the modern,

467
00:25:02.351 --> 00:25:06.670
progressive that wants the government to do everything that is completely

468
00:25:06.671 --> 00:25:07.630
against free speech, right?

469
00:25:07.631 --> 00:25:10.540
Liberals are supposed to be the ones force free speech. The ACLU,

470
00:25:10.541 --> 00:25:14.230
when it was a good organization, was a free speech organization.

471
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:17.560
The ACLU is now is now a bunch of leftist hacks.

472
00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:22.750
Trump in a bizarre sense is saving liberalism because as I've talked about many

473
00:25:22.751 --> 00:25:25.360
times, the liberals don't know how to save liberalism.

474
00:25:25.361 --> 00:25:29.320
Why are all the liberal institutions crumbling? Well, the liberals who said, ah,

475
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:30.940
we're tolerant and decent.

476
00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:35.740
They let in all of these bad ideas to their institutions, to Harvard, to Yale,

477
00:25:35.741 --> 00:25:38.380
to the big businesses and all the woke companies,

478
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:42.640
they let all of these bad ideas in. And next thing you know,

479
00:25:42.641 --> 00:25:47.530
you've got racial quotas at schools and racial quote, racial quotas on,

480
00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:51.100
on company boards. And now in bananas, California,

481
00:25:51.101 --> 00:25:55.600
you've got people wanting to put racial quotas on the amount of public officials

482
00:25:55.601 --> 00:25:56.740
that we can put in. These were the,

483
00:25:56.770 --> 00:26:00.610
these were the bad ideas of the past that liberals used to fight against. Well,

484
00:26:00.611 --> 00:26:03.970
who's the one fighting against those things. It's not the liberals,

485
00:26:03.971 --> 00:26:06.640
just sitting around, talking about it, watching their houses burn.

486
00:26:06.641 --> 00:26:10.900
It's actually Donald Trump who getting critical race theory out of the federal

487
00:26:10.901 --> 00:26:15.040
institutions. Who's, uh, who got title nine out of the colleges.

488
00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:19.240
So I think you can make an argument that Trump is actually the one saving

489
00:26:19.241 --> 00:26:21.790
liberalism and saving conservatism.

490
00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.820
And I know it sounds bananas and crazy and it's like, well, he,

491
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.420
he's not a traditional liberal and he's not a traditional conservative.

492
00:26:28.421 --> 00:26:31.120
And that sort of is why this whole thing is so weird.

493
00:26:31.121 --> 00:26:35.020
And I don't even sit here as a, as a maggot hat wearing anything.

494
00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:37.480
I'm just telling, I'm just telling you what I think.

495
00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.210
And I think I'm onto something there. And I'll just say one other thing,

496
00:26:40.211 --> 00:26:44.760
which is, if you basically are on what I just said there, if that,

497
00:26:44.761 --> 00:26:47.640
if any of that made sense to you, well then think of the other version of it.

498
00:26:47.641 --> 00:26:52.110
So what is Biden saving, right? Like what is, what is Biden mean? Well,

499
00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:55.350
if your ideas that he's saving, you're voting for Biden.

500
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:56.550
Cause I think a lot of people are doing this.

501
00:26:56.551 --> 00:26:59.550
They're voting for biding because it reminds them of something before Trump.

502
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.640
Right? And I think there's a, there's a certain comfort in that like, Oh,

503
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:04.620
maybe the world could go back to that. Well,

504
00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:09.210
the base and the media and the future of the Democrats that they hate the old

505
00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:12.090
world, they hate the constitution, 16, 19 project.

506
00:27:12.091 --> 00:27:14.310
They hate the founding of America. All of these things,

507
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:18.390
they're making it very clear that the old ways were all wrong and run by racists

508
00:27:18.391 --> 00:27:19.200
and everything else.

509
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.610
So that's why Biden after 47 years of being in government,

510
00:27:23.611 --> 00:27:26.820
does it doesn't make sense that at any level, because it's like, if,

511
00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:30.510
if the base is right and that everything has been so wrong,

512
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.410
well then Biden was either part of it and didn't do anything of it or he helped

513
00:27:34.411 --> 00:27:39.300
cause it, um, so the idea that you're conserving something by voting for Biden,

514
00:27:39.301 --> 00:27:41.880
conserving just the way the world used to be like, that's not it.

515
00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:44.940
And then how is he also not saving liberalism? It's like,

516
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:49.980
if you think Joe Biden, because I do think he's probably more at his best.

517
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.710
He's more of an old school liberal. Um,

518
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.500
then I don't think he's like one of these crazy Progressive's, but he also,

519
00:27:55.501 --> 00:27:57.630
the other day said that, you know, when you're eight years old,

520
00:27:57.631 --> 00:27:59.220
you can decide to be transgender. I mean,

521
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:01.200
the guy just doesn't know what he's talking about at this point.

522
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:06.210
If you think that he can stand up to what the left is, importing, you're just,

523
00:28:06.211 --> 00:28:08.130
you're just mistaken. So in many ways,

524
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:12.900
a vote for Biden will be a vote to accelerate the destruction of race of

525
00:28:12.901 --> 00:28:16.650
racism. You almost got me, there are people,

526
00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:21.210
it will be a vote to accelerate the destruction of liberalism.

527
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:25.950
And I just see it that way. I, I can't see it any other way,

528
00:28:25.951 --> 00:28:28.740
but I would love to hear your thoughts on it. Anyway, guys,

529
00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:32.670
I got a long day of interviews and doing other people's shows and a whole bunch

530
00:28:32.671 --> 00:28:36.690
of other stuff debate tonight. We're going to be having pizza.

531
00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:40.500
I think I know we're doing wings tonight. It is wing night at the Rubin report.

532
00:28:40.501 --> 00:28:42.180
So I'll have some wings sauce all over my face.

533
00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:46.320
Little tequila for you at seven 30 Pacific, 10 30 Eastern. I'll see you then.

534
00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:48.960
And then Glenn, back after that. And then, you know,

535
00:28:48.961 --> 00:28:51.240
we'll see if the world's still here tomorrow. I have a feeling it will be,

536
00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:52.080
but we'll find out.
