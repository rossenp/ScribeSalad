00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.720
<v 0>My worry is this, if I had enough said this on bar rescue,</v>

2
00:00:03.721 --> 00:00:06.090
if there's 60 motorcycles in front of a bar,

3
00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:08.820
there's a bunch of people that won't go to that bar, right?

4
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:12.390
If there's a bunch of people dressed in gang colors in front of a bar,

5
00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:14.610
there's people who won't go in that bar today,

6
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.000
if there's a bunch of people in front of a bar that look irresponsible,

7
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:21.180
as it relates to COVID they're customers that won't go in that bar.

8
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.050
It's no different.

9
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.940
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

10
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:32.773
<v 0>The question. If I can,</v>

11
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.560
if you were going to go out tonight and a restaurant that was open and it was a

12
00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:38.600
crowd of people in that front of that restaurant,

13
00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:41.120
and none of them were marrying wearing masks, would you go in.

14
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.300
<v 2>So it's interesting. So I'll tell you,</v>

15
00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:48.170
I have only been to one restaurant since this all happened. It was last week.

16
00:00:48.171 --> 00:00:49.880
It was a restaurant right by my house,

17
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.930
just a burger joint bar that I go to every now and again, the waitress,

18
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.500
I was not wearing a mask there and it was pretty sporadic. So, you know,

19
00:00:57.501 --> 00:01:01.880
I was with one person, the waitress was wearing a mask and a face guard.

20
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.900
And, you know, it's, it's not that comfortable. We, you know, this, you,

21
00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:08.720
you need to re read people's faces to feel comfortable.

22
00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:13.280
It feels sort of weird with all that. I think for me at this point as a,

23
00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:17.960
as a relatively young healthy person, if I went to a nice restaurant,

24
00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:21.380
let's say in Beverly Hills or something like that, I would be okay. If,

25
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.980
if people were not wearing stuff, I actually would be okay with that.

26
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.000
But I don't,

27
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.820
I don't consider myself in the last third that you just talked about.

28
00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:32.840
I think I'm somewhere between the first, third and the second third, I think.

29
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.590
Um, and also, you know, here in Los Angeles where we've been closed for so long,

30
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.100
I think I'm also having like a reverse reaction,

31
00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:42.830
which I think a lot of people are having, which is like, let's just go,

32
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.990
let's just go and see what happens. Yeah.

33
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.580
<v 0>Yeah. You know, I worry about, uh, um, irresponsibility,</v>

34
00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:52.610
not on the part of restaurant owners, you know, I'm concerned Dave,

35
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.350
that a restaurant does everything, right.

36
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.460
It sanitizes puts their employees in a proper gear. Uh,

37
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.390
but all the procedures in the kitchen, all the PPE attire, you know,

38
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.370
has everything exactly right.

39
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.810
But then a bunch of customers come in without masks create a bad impression,

40
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.590
pictures, go on social media of this place pack.

41
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.790
And then all of the portion of society that wants to wear a mask will never go

42
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:20.450
there. So there's a real challenge for business today.

43
00:02:20.451 --> 00:02:24.050
And I think I know the answer, but I'm not quite sure if my answer is right,

44
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.800
if you, and this is deep, Dave, if you were in a bar business and you said,

45
00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:31.490
okay, I'm going to play country music, no rock and roll. People are coming.

46
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.350
You've made a decision.

47
00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:36.980
That's going to completely segment your business to country people only.

48
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.920
So you're not, you're going to see some boots. You're going to see some hats.

49
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.350
You're not going to see a lot of Armani suits probably.

50
00:02:42.351 --> 00:02:45.440
And it's going to be a country environment. Let's say you chose.

51
00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:48.830
I don't want to do that. I'm going to play rock and roll in my bar. Okay?

52
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.950
No country people there, no hip hop people there.

53
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.210
You just segmented your business to a portion of the population. Let's say,

54
00:02:56.211 --> 00:02:59.620
you say, I'm going to play hip hop. Same deal, no country, no rock.

55
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:03.970
You segmented yourself into a certain segment of the population. My point is,

56
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:07.960
this is the mask wearers. And as the non mask wears,

57
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.490
and I think that restaurants are going to be put in a position where they're

58
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:16.630
going to have to choose just like that music segmentation, ed,

59
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:18.940
you have to wear a mask in my restaurant when you're not eating.

60
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.780
You have to marrow West where you're wearing outside or you don't.

61
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.970
But I don't think mixing it is going to work long-term and that's a really tough

62
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.500
choice. And nobody's talking about this in the industry, do it, or don't do it.

63
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.620
What do we have to do is, and it's a segmenting decision,

64
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:37.810
just like music is or price points are.

65
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.110
So I'm of the belief that restaurants need to pick.

66
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.320
And I'm of the belief for long-term sustainability.

67
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:45.400
And here's what I worry about.

68
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:47.620
We are living in a culture of accountability today.

69
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.780
Pico people go out and have a bad meal.

70
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:52.900
It's all over Yelp in a matter of minutes, right? Dirty all.

71
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.070
So if people get sick in a restaurant and it's traced back to a restaurant done

72
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.520
case closed, that place will never open again. In New York,

73
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:04.390
they're going to take liquor licenses away if customers act irresponsibly.

74
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.570
So we're at a turning point as an industry.

75
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.650
Are we going to allow the behavior of customers to destroy our investment?

76
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.350
Or are we going to regulate that behavior?

77
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.310
The nightclub business has been doing this for years by segmenting, by music,

78
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:21.370
segmenting by dress codes and doing segmentation.

79
00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:23.110
We survive in a segmented world.

80
00:04:23.111 --> 00:04:25.240
Since I got in this business all these years ago,

81
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.120
I don't believe that we can succeed as an industry.

82
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.220
If we don't choose what side we're on.

83
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.440
And if we choose to run in an unprotected environment and choose to not do

84
00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:38.110
some of these processes that can keep people safe,

85
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.240
we may pay the ultimate price.

86
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.750
And the ultimate price is not only getting somebody sick or potentially killing

87
00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:48.280
them, but destroying your business. So I take an opposite position to you,

88
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.170
and I'm not sure that I would let you in my restaurant or stand in front of it

89
00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:54.004
without a mask.

90
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.400
<v 2>Yeah. And I totally hear you. I, I it's, it's, it's a personal choice,</v>

91
00:04:59.401 --> 00:05:02.520
not only for the individual consumer, but obviously for the,

92
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.750
for the owner of the bar restaurant.

93
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.920
Do you think what makes it even more muddled? What confuses it even more?

94
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.240
Is that it's one thing.

95
00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:12.360
If you're walking into a clothing store and you're wearing a mask while you're

96
00:05:12.361 --> 00:05:16.410
not using your mouth, you're not using your face at a restaurant. It's like,

97
00:05:16.411 --> 00:05:18.960
well, wait a minute. I can walk in. I have to wear a mask.

98
00:05:18.961 --> 00:05:22.440
Let's say when I walk in, but we do know I have to drink through my mouth.

99
00:05:22.441 --> 00:05:24.210
I have to eat through my mouth. So we,

100
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.390
so there's these sort of inconsistencies where it's like, people are just like,

101
00:05:27.391 --> 00:05:29.310
well then why am I doing it at all? Like, it's just,

102
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.770
it's just the natural questions that arise.

103
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.640
<v 0>Well, if there's spacing at the tables and people were standing in front of the</v>

104
00:05:35.641 --> 00:05:38.790
restaurant without that level of spacing, I think it's reasonable for us to say,

105
00:05:38.791 --> 00:05:43.050
we'd appreciate you wearing a mask until you've seen it. Right. Seems,

106
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.020
seems like a simple definition. My worry is this.

107
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.510
If I had enough said this on bar rescue,

108
00:05:48.511 --> 00:05:50.850
if there's 60 motorcycles in front of a bar,

109
00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:53.580
there's a bunch of people that won't go to that bar, right?

110
00:05:53.581 --> 00:05:57.590
If there's a bunch of people dressed in gang colors in front of a there's people

111
00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:59.390
who won't go in that bar today,

112
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.780
if there's a bunch of people in front of a bar that book irresponsible,

113
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:05.960
as it relates to COVID, there are customers that won't go in that bar.

114
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.340
It's no different. So when you say about how are we going to be successful?

115
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:15.170
There's two issues. There's that issue. And all of that is driven by this one.

116
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:18.620
Premise and bear with me for a minute. Dave, if you, you, you're a burger guy,

117
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:20.780
right? You love a good burger. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

118
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.220
So let's say that your favorite burger place in town after this pandemic,

119
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:29.600
you go walk up to it. Everybody's packed in there. They're not wearing masks.

120
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:31.850
You know, they're not even wearing masks behind the counter.

121
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.770
The whole thing just doesn't feel right.

122
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.600
But two blocks farther away is your second favorite burger place farther,

123
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.990
but they're clean their pipe. Their staff is in mass. I mean,

124
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:44.690
this place is together. It looks great. Safe.

125
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.570
You're now going to go to your second favorite burger place,

126
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:50.570
which is farther away than your first burger place. Dave,

127
00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:52.580
that changes everything.

128
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.760
Trust has now ratcheted to the top.

129
00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.680
So now you're going to walk farther to go to your second favorite burger place.

130
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.550
Cause your first favorite burger place didn't gain your trust.

131
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.810
<v 2>Well, it's, it's interesting because yeah, well,</v>

132
00:07:07.811 --> 00:07:11.440
it's interesting because you're talking about free market capitalism and also

133
00:07:11.441 --> 00:07:14.920
talking about rules, but ultimately you're saying it's,

134
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.230
it's on people to make the right choices.

135
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.780
<v 0>So if in fact trust is ratcheting up to the top of the</v>

136
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.410
motivation list of what businesses I choose to do business with,

137
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:29.230
how do we build trust? And this goes back to your question,

138
00:07:29.231 --> 00:07:33.520
how do we get successful now? Well, if we know that we have thirds, then we,

139
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.190
if we know we have to build trust for, even for you,

140
00:07:36.191 --> 00:07:40.960
who's quicker to go out maybe than I am. Then how do we build trust?

141
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.830
Well, trust isn't words. Trust is an advertising. Campaigns.

142
00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:48.790
Trust is transparency, right? You begin to trust me as an individual.

143
00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:51.940
Once you get to know me, a little right trust is built.

144
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.570
So trust is a very difficult emotion to build in a person.

145
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.150
So we need to be transparent.

146
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.400
So the way we create transparency is by creating visual standards of

147
00:08:03.401 --> 00:08:06.550
what people see and what they can expect in our business. So for example,

148
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.470
a few weeks ago, and the social media data,

149
00:08:08.471 --> 00:08:12.340
some guys making lasagna in a kitchen and he posts a picture of the cook and

150
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.820
he's standing in the stainless steel line and he's laying a lasagna noodle in

151
00:08:15.821 --> 00:08:16.654
the pan.

152
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:21.490
And the post says our famous lasagna will be ready for curbside pickup at five

153
00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:25.990
o'clock pretty noble effort, right? Guy's not wearing a mask.

154
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.600
He's wearing a ball cap from home.

155
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.820
He's wearing clear cheap plastic gloves that, that somebody wears in a salon.

156
00:08:33.821 --> 00:08:34.810
When they do hair color,

157
00:08:34.811 --> 00:08:38.500
it's not even food service rated all the imaging is wrong.

158
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:44.200
So if we don't build trust, nobody's going to eat that fricking lasagna.

159
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.000
So we as an industry have to really understand how to build trust.

160
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.030
What do we, what are the marketing communications of trust?

161
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.860
When you walk up to the front door of my business, retail restaurant bar,

162
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.530
what looks different? Oh,

163
00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:03.180
they changed this and subliminally you saying, well, they changed it for me.

164
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.570
They're keeping me safe. This is a good thing. Oh, I feel good about this.

165
00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:10.260
I like this. Okay. This make from one little thing,

166
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:14.850
all of these assumptions go through your head. So what has to be different?

167
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:17.340
I suggest that every business needs to change something.

168
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.290
They need to change their seating layout.

169
00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:20.910
They need to change signage in a front.

170
00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:23.280
They need to put a podium out front for check-in.

171
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.600
They need to do something that sends the message of trust in a transparent way.

172
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.000
If I can send the message of trust in this world, I can get the first, third,

173
00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:35.790
the second, third, and a third. Third. If trust,

174
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.710
if that first third lamb slams out social media with untrusting visuals,

175
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:43.770
you're going to have a hell of a time getting it to second and third, third.

176
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:49.550
<v 2>So where do you think, uh, government and regulation kind of fit into this?</v>

177
00:09:49.551 --> 00:09:50.480
Because you know,

178
00:09:50.481 --> 00:09:54.200
we're hearing all sorts of arbitrary things or seemingly arbitrary things every

179
00:09:54.201 --> 00:09:55.970
week, depending on where you live, you know, okay.

180
00:09:55.971 --> 00:09:59.120
We can be at 50% restaurant capacity,

181
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:03.410
but that's regardless whether you've done all of these precautions or not done

182
00:10:03.411 --> 00:10:04.310
all of these progressions.

183
00:10:04.311 --> 00:10:07.730
And I'm sure you must be hearing from owners of restaurants and bars who were

184
00:10:07.731 --> 00:10:10.970
saying, Hey, I'll do everything that I possibly can do.

185
00:10:10.971 --> 00:10:13.010
I'll put all the investment and we'll do all the work.

186
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.220
But if we can only open at 50% capacity, we,

187
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:20.450
there's no way we can succeed regardless of doing everything or not doing

188
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:21.463
anything.

189
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.130
<v 0>Well, I don't disagree with you. So new revenue centers need to be found,</v>

190
00:10:25.131 --> 00:10:26.660
hence delivery, curbside pickup,

191
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.990
but there are these third party delivery apps are destroying our industry.

192
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.830
You know, they're the only people who make money. You pay them 25 up to 35%,

193
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:37.790
third party delivery app. So, so I beg people on this podcast.

194
00:10:37.791 --> 00:10:40.820
If you want to do it to go order or curbside delivery or to call the restaurant

195
00:10:40.821 --> 00:10:44.900
directly, don't call one of these third party sources. It's a huge deal to them.

196
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.330
It's a huge difference in the way they make money.

197
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.630
