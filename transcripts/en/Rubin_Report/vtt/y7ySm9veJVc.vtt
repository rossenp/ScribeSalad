1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.660
<v 0>People around the world who are fighting for equality.</v>

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.670
And I really mean this.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.310
There are totally annoyed at the New York, Hollywood,

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.740
West Hollywood, gays, who,

5
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.040
who raise a lot of money for black tie events.

6
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.410
And aren't doing a thing to help our brothers and sisters in Lebanon who

7
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:23.550
are getting arrested.

8
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.830
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

9
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.240
<v 0>I went to the 1993 March on Washington for, uh, when,</v>

10
00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:35.150
when bill Clinton and Al Gore had taken over.

11
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.440
And that March was incredible because there I'm going to get the number wrong

12
00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:41.870
and somebody's gonna come out. Oh yeah,

13
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.830
I think it was like a million people write a male gays and lesbians and straight

14
00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:48.290
supporters all came out to Washington and marched.

15
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.150
And it was dramatic in that. I think it was that, that point,

16
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.900
that, that things became political, um,

17
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.460
on gays and lesbians and the LGBT movement. Um, before then,

18
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.100
we've kind of all were on the outs. And so we were together.

19
00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:08.360
We were in Washington, you know, people, Republicans and Democrats were, uh,

20
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.190
not making this, the wedge issue,

21
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.740
but I will say that the, that the March on Washington,

22
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.020
um, left our community with a sense of, we just want equality.

23
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.420
And if you go back to that, March, Dave,

24
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.670
the mantra was tolerance and diversity.

25
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.680
We recognized that other people were not going to agree with us.

26
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.420
And our whole request,

27
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.470
our ask was just embrace diversity.

28
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.550
We know you don't, you don't agree with everything that, that, you know,

29
00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:48.110
we stand for, but let's just be tolerant of each other. So remember,

30
00:01:48.111 --> 00:01:50.750
hate is not a family value was this whole thing.

31
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.850
Now the entire leadership of the LGBT movement in Washington,

32
00:01:55.851 --> 00:02:00.530
DC is all about cancel culture and absolutely

33
00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:03.920
pushing people out of the argument to say, I'm,

34
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.720
I don't even want to be friends with you. If you voted for Trump or you're gay,

35
00:02:08.721 --> 00:02:11.630
conservative, I can't even fathom being friends with you.

36
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.970
<v 1>Well, now they also want to take your gayness away, right?</v>

37
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:15.050
So they'll write articles,

38
00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:19.670
that famous article in our magazine about how Peter teal is not gay enough

39
00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:22.910
because it's because it's not who you have sex with or who you love that makes

40
00:02:22.911 --> 00:02:26.410
you gay. It's actually a political way of thinking that makes you gay, which is.

41
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.830
<v 0>Which is why glad, um, has this whole like immigration.</v>

42
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.290
And it's a movement beyond anything that has to do with gays and

43
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:40.790
lesbians. And I think it's an example they're trying to survive, right?

44
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.980
<v 1>That just the cops need a certain amount of crime type of thing.</v>

45
00:02:42.981 --> 00:02:46.840
It's like we got equal rights and not to say everything is perfect and right.

46
00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.830
<v 0>But I work, I work around the world.</v>

47
00:02:48.831 --> 00:02:53.480
Let me tell you people around the world who are fighting for

48
00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:56.150
equality. And I really mean this.

49
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.780
There are totally annoyed at the New York, Hollywood,

50
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.160
West Hollywood, gays, who,

51
00:03:04.161 --> 00:03:07.510
who raised a lot of money for black tie events.

52
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.880
And aren't doing a thing to help our brothers and sisters in Lebanon who

53
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:16.120
are getting arrested or look what happened in Zambia.

54
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.160
They literally prosecuted to two guys for being gay. And the court said, Oh no,

55
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:23.860
we're doing this because they're gay. They didn't make up some pedophilia.

56
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.390
<v 1>No, no. But if you say something about that, you're somehow racist, right.</v>

57
00:03:27.391 --> 00:03:30.930
Or you're beautiful or something like that because you're pushing your values,

58
00:03:30.931 --> 00:03:33.840
but some values are better than others. That must be the number one thing.

59
00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:35.040
You have to fight all the time, right?

60
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.730
At the UN or over the years at the UN that you had to fight that now as an

61
00:03:38.731 --> 00:03:39.564
ambassador.

62
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.760
<v 0>I'm now fighting this thing at the state department where,</v>

63
00:03:41.761 --> 00:03:45.690
when it comes to the decriminalization campaign, um, so you're,

64
00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:48.690
you're spearheading this thing, right? I'm spearheading this thing. Uh,

65
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.760
there's 69 countries that criminalize,

66
00:03:50.761 --> 00:03:54.510
homosexuality 10 will kill you for being gay.

67
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.110
And we've launched a process. Uh, we've done a whole bunch.

68
00:03:58.111 --> 00:04:01.260
We're trying to stay out of the media in terms of telling them every little

69
00:04:01.261 --> 00:04:06.060
thing, uh, because the media is pretty hostile to something like this. Uh,

70
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.100
we've, we've, we're making great progress.

71
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.100
<v 1>He is pretty hostile to something like decriminalize it.</v>

72
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.740
<v 0>From the Trump administration. Right? Honestly.</v>

73
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.000
<v 1>Well, we'll get to that.</v>

74
00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:17.850
I was about to tell you a second ago that we've talked for about a half hour or

75
00:04:17.851 --> 00:04:21.600
so. And until about a minute ago, the T word had not come up yet,

76
00:04:21.601 --> 00:04:24.600
which I think is a record. Uh, but we'll, so we'll get to that in a second,

77
00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:25.434
but sorry, go ahead.

78
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.290
<v 0>But the decriminalization campaign, um,</v>

79
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.040
w we're making so much progress, uh,

80
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.400
granted this is going to be a long fight, uh,

81
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.140
trying to convince 69 countries to do a change in

82
00:04:40.141 --> 00:04:44.780
domestic laws to, to not criminalize homosexuality. And that's all, this is,

83
00:04:44.781 --> 00:04:47.400
is step one is just to work on criminalization.

84
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.380
Others are working on step two through 20.

85
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.600
I felt the need to do step one, because when I look around the world, step one,

86
00:04:54.601 --> 00:04:58.440
wasn't really being pushed. Um, I've been working with, no,

87
00:04:58.441 --> 00:05:01.500
this is going to be bad cause they're probably going to go after them. But, um,

88
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.290
I've been working with Stuart milk of the Harvey milk foundation.

89
00:05:04.291 --> 00:05:08.610
Who's fantastic. Who's totally focused on this problem.

90
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.010
And so what we're trying to do is to have 69 different,

91
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.360
uh, campaigns basically, cause you've got to work with the local, um,

92
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.220
community remarkable stories that I could just go in over and over that I

93
00:05:23.221 --> 00:05:23.641
don't,

94
00:05:23.641 --> 00:05:27.540
because I don't want to highlight it and scare people away that are working in

95
00:05:27.541 --> 00:05:30.420
these countries. But suffice to say, um,

96
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.050
this was a fight that needed to happen. That was not happening.

97
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.460
And right now I have to face at the state department

98
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.010
resistance from people who don't want Americans or Westerners to go into other

99
00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:48.780
countries and take a stand for the decriminalization campaign.

100
00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:52.890
Because literally there are countries that believe that the West and

101
00:05:52.891 --> 00:05:57.150
specifically America have imported into their country being gay.

102
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.540
And so they're like, Oh no,

103
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:03.200
no American should talk about this because you're going to emphasize my position

104
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:07.910
back is that's the stupidest idea that Americans brought in the

105
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.380
gay. Right.

106
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.090
<v 1>Right. There were no gay people before America. It's only about 200 year thing.</v>

107
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.490
<v 0>Right?</v>

108
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.380
So I'm not going to actually be silent on that and participate in letting them

109
00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:20.650
silence me because they've got some crazy conspiracy theory.

110
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.600
I'm going to bust the conspiracy theory wide open and say, you're wrong.

111
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.790
<v 1>How do you decide the, when to use extra pressure to get a country,</v>

112
00:06:30.791 --> 00:06:32.070
to do something? Because I know as,

113
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.270
as generally as a conservative and from what I know about you,

114
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.810
you don't love the idea of telling countries what to do.

115
00:06:37.811 --> 00:06:40.870
Like it's not really like in the conservative ethos. Right.

116
00:06:40.871 --> 00:06:42.700
And yet I understand you want people to be free.

117
00:06:42.701 --> 00:06:45.820
So how do you decide when we can apply more pressure or questions? Yeah.

118
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.250
I got one. I get one every interview.

119
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.420
<v 0>Sure. I would say that I have this philosophy that,</v>

120
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.340
that as a diplomat,

121
00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.430
I am working at the state department and I have to be successful

122
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.530
in order to avoid war.

123
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.270
Because if you have diplomats who are not successful,

124
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.770
that file of a problem gets transferred over to the Pentagon and they don't

125
00:07:11.771 --> 00:07:14.170
negotiate. They just solved the problem.

126
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.300
And so I firmly believe that diplomats should be at the forefront

127
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:24.730
of pushing and prodding and demanding talks and demanding that we have a

128
00:07:24.731 --> 00:07:29.560
table to, to, you know, air our grievances on, even before, like,

129
00:07:29.561 --> 00:07:34.210
if we're planning to bomb, if, if the, if DOD is ready to,

130
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.260
to attack, I would hope that we have brave diplomats that are saying,

131
00:07:38.261 --> 00:07:41.950
wait a minute, I got one more chance. Let's sit down,

132
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:47.080
let's try the diplomacy thing. So, you know, I get hit constantly for, Oh,

133
00:07:47.081 --> 00:07:49.450
you're undiplomatic or you're too tough. And I thought,

134
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.630
that's what you want in the diplomat.

135
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.350
Cause you want to have somebody that's working hard to avoid war,

136
00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:58.330
to talk through,

137
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:03.280
through pushing and prodding rather than transferring the file over and,

138
00:08:03.281 --> 00:08:06.130
and, you know, having a problem solved through military act.

139
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:07.600
<v 1>Has some of that been tough for you though,</v>

140
00:08:07.601 --> 00:08:11.410
because you used to fight on Twitter more or be more of like a battler there

141
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.290
where, you know, you've, you're an ambassador now you're a guy in a hoodie.

142
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.450
You've calmed it down a little bit.

143
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.420
<v 0>I still think that I pick my fights. Um,</v>

144
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:24.400
I don't feel like I've backed off. What I do think is,

145
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.630
um, that, that I want to make sure that someone is in that fight.

146
00:08:28.631 --> 00:08:30.960
And so I look to see, you know, like, uh,

147
00:08:30.961 --> 00:08:33.880
a media bias issue.

148
00:08:33.881 --> 00:08:38.530
I still get really charged up if the group think in

149
00:08:38.531 --> 00:08:40.870
Washington or the political circles is one way.

150
00:08:40.871 --> 00:08:45.040
And nobody's challenging that I'm willing to jump in.

151
00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:47.050
I don't care if I have the title of ambassador,

152
00:08:47.051 --> 00:08:51.040
I'm still gonna jump in and try to push and correct the record where I see fit,

153
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.850
if others are doing it. And thank God you're in there to do it. Uh,

154
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.880
then sometimes I can little ground support.

155
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.550
I can let it go and look for the next problem. Yeah.

156
00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:00.170
<v 1>Um,</v>

157
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:04.220
can you talk a little bit about just generally what the state of the UN is and

158
00:09:04.221 --> 00:09:05.990
what it was like to be there and you know,

159
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.970
that so many people think that it's like this sort of perfect thing that the

160
00:09:10.971 --> 00:09:14.810
countries come together and figure out what's right for everybody.

161
00:09:14.811 --> 00:09:18.980
Like they love the idea of it more than I think functionally how it works or

162
00:09:18.981 --> 00:09:19.840
does not work.

163
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.880
<v 0>Well, first of all, the, uh,</v>

164
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.410
I always try to correct people that the UN doesn't really exist.

165
00:09:27.411 --> 00:09:31.880
The UN is member States, right? So when somebody says, Oh, the UN says, no,

166
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.870
I always say the UN doesn't say no members at the UN,

167
00:09:35.871 --> 00:09:39.200
maybe Russia and China got together in the security council and said, no,

168
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.070
but the UN doesn't take a position. And so I,

169
00:09:43.071 --> 00:09:46.250
I try to not just reflexively blame, Oh,

170
00:09:46.251 --> 00:09:49.610
the UN stopped something cause it's really member countries.

171
00:09:49.611 --> 00:09:51.530
That's the first thing. The second thing is,

172
00:09:51.531 --> 00:09:55.460
is the UN does not work unless the U S is leading it.

173
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.530
Whether it's the world food program, UNICEF UN DP, you know,

174
00:10:00.531 --> 00:10:04.490
the development programs, whatever it is, the us has to be there.

175
00:10:04.491 --> 00:10:06.170
Otherwise the UN does not work.

176
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.560
<v 1>If you're looking for more honest and thoughtful conversations about politics,</v>
