00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.700
<v 0>I think your audience needs to know something.</v>

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.420
Cause I don't talk about it a lot. Um,

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.460
every single second, every word I say,

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.240
and every conservative is saying on airways,

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.950
but it seems like Fox talk, radio podcasts like yours. You trust me,

6
00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:21.930
you are going to experience a lot of this.

7
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.290
As your popularity has grown by leaps and bounds. You've already got,

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.920
I get my share. You get your share and I've seen it.

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.660
And what people don't know is literally millions and millions of dollars are

10
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:37.080
being spent to record every single word we say.

11
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.030
<v 1>I'm Dave Rubin. And this is the Rubin report. Quick reminder,</v>

12
00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:48.230
everyone to subscribe to our YouTube channel and click that pesky notification

13
00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:49.670
bell so that you see our videos.

14
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.300
And joining me today is the host of Hannity on Fox news,

15
00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:58.130
as well as the host of the Sean Hannity radio show and author of the new book

16
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.270
live free or die America and the world on the brink.

17
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.730
Sean Hannity finally welcome to the Ruben report.

18
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.630
<v 0>No, I w well thank you for having me. Thank you also,</v>

19
00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:13.220
because you have been an incredible addition to the TV show.

20
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.310
We've got to get you on radio more. Um, part of our,

21
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.690
we have a regular ensemble cast. You're now a part of that. Um,

22
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.210
our audience loves you. The feedback's phenomenal.

23
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:27.890
I know how popular this podcast is. Uh, you are outspoken, iconic,

24
00:01:27.891 --> 00:01:31.280
classic, a free thinker, uh,

25
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.300
independent believe in freedom and Liberty and free speech.

26
00:01:35.301 --> 00:01:39.680
And you're not part of the cancel culture and boycott and shut everybody down

27
00:01:39.681 --> 00:01:42.050
that you disagree with. And, and frankly,

28
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.970
isn't it crazy that we conservatives are those guys that were the ones. No,

29
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.520
I don't want to cancel anybody, boycott anybody or get anyone fired.

30
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.400
Let people decide, let people have freedom of choice.

31
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.380
<v 1>Yeah, well, I suppose I could just let you go and say nice things about me,</v>

32
00:01:57.381 --> 00:02:01.640
but I'll [inaudible] because I actually, I got the book yesterday.

33
00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:03.260
I read about half of it so far,

34
00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:05.240
but I want to start with exactly what you just said there.

35
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.370
Cause you said it to me on air a couple of weeks ago,

36
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.810
and I thought it made a really good point that you get boycotted all the time.

37
00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:14.120
You know, media matters and the rest of these guys,

38
00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:17.300
they're constantly coming after you trying to take you out,

39
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:19.190
take out your sponsors, et cetera, et cetera.

40
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.470
But you personally never call for a boycott for any of the guys that are

41
00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:27.740
doing far worse stuff. In my opinion, then you're doing,

42
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.150
could you just talk a little bit about what it's like to just be in that machine

43
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.901
all the time,

44
00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:36.470
just be in that atmosphere of boycotts and the rest of it all the time.

45
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.490
<v 0>I think your audience needs to know something.</v>

46
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.210
Cause I don't talk about it a lot. Um,

47
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.250
every single second, every word I say,

48
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.030
and every conservative is saying on airways,

49
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.740
but it seems like Fox talk, radio podcasts like yours. You trust me,

50
00:02:57.741 --> 00:03:01.990
you are going to experience lot of this as your popularity has grown by leaps

51
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:04.840
and bounds. You already got, I get my share.

52
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:06.730
You get your share I've and I've seen it.

53
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.440
And what people don't know is literally millions and millions of dollars are

54
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:16.120
being spent to record every single word we say in the hopes that we

55
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:18.640
say one word, one phrase, one sentence,

56
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.700
there's one paragraph that either they don't like,

57
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.410
or they'll take out of context or they'll clip so that they could

58
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:30.820
either boycott us to make us financially, um, not,

59
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.800
not viable, which you know, there is a business aspect of being on the air.

60
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.060
It's not cheap to be on the air,

61
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:39.730
whether it's a podcast or radio show or TV show,

62
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.710
because they want to silence you.

63
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.140
I can give you my track record going back to the time that bill Maher now I'll

64
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:50.920
be very Frank. I hate Bowlmor. I don't like his show.

65
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.370
I think it's gotten worse. I think he's radical, extreme.

66
00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:57.370
I disagree with pretty much everything that's come out of his mouth.

67
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.900
I've had him on a guest as a guest or a number of times. Uh, but I,

68
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.440
I do respect his iconic classic style.

69
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.090
I do respect that. He'll say things that he knows will upset people,

70
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.160
but it was people like myself when ABC was canceling politically incorrect.

71
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.860
Uh, that said, no, don't cancel this. Literally standing up for him.

72
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.420
Now we'll never get credit for that.

73
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.710
I've never had or witnessed liberals or liberal groups.

74
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.310
Now they say they're for free speech. They they're pro-choice but they're not.

75
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.110
Because every time there is any effort to boycott any conservative voice,

76
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:39.970
libertarian voice or any voice, they just don't like, it's always okay.

77
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.570
We got to get them fired, get them canceled, boycott them.

78
00:04:43.571 --> 00:04:46.570
So they're financially, they're not viable anymore.

79
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.750
And then ultimately what the goal is to get their voice off the air,

80
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.940
every single, prominent, conservative, this is not a small effort.

81
00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.100
We are talking about tens and tens of millions of dollars to do

82
00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:05.080
this. And it's done. It's an intimidation tactic.

83
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.050
And it's funny because I can tell you,

84
00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:10.720
I can give you a long list of people that I, for example,

85
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:15.280
I had a huge Twitter feud with Jimmy Kimmel that went on for a while

86
00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.840
and I went at him hard and I reminded him of all those stupid things that he

87
00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:23.080
said it all started. Cause he was making fun of Melania Trump's accent.

88
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.260
When she was reading books to children, I'm like,

89
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.790
are we really going to pick on women?

90
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.560
And then I brought up all the old videos of him, uh, you know,

91
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.510
cause caramel loan.

92
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.630
<v 2>Right? Yeah. Put putting.</v>

93
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.950
<v 0>Like cucumbers in his pants and approaching women from,</v>

94
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.280
from old shows he did. And then I would always hashtag Disney.

95
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.480
Cause I always knew Disney had no appetite for a controversy not to get them

96
00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:52.150
fired, but to send a message, you're going to be a.

97
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.380
I can be a back now when he really came under fire recently

98
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.750
and apologized for that older skid, as it relates to Carl alone, uh,

99
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.120
like Jimmy Fallon did elite year earlier.

100
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.960
Not once that I even comment on it, I stayed out of it.

101
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.000
I had had my fight with them. I'm not a boycotter I'm not a canceler.

102
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.470
I actually believe that people should have the freedom of choice.

103
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.340
People have to choose to listen to my radio show,

104
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:25.580
watch my TV show and sign up for your podcast,

105
00:06:25.581 --> 00:06:27.440
which is enormously popular.

106
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.460
It's one of the most popular podcasts out there now and all credit to you,

107
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.300
but you're a target to why is it the left?

108
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.130
Doesn't stand up for freedom and Liberty and free thought and expression and the

109
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:44.630
free open exchange of ideas. You know, I'll say this too,

110
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.520
they act like they're so outraged, Donald Trump outrageous. And they wake up,

111
00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:54.170
Donald Trump says this or that they're outraged. It is selective feigned,

112
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.760
moral outrage. It's not real. It is phony. It is,

113
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:03.110
it is selective because they want to act all outright. That,

114
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.340
that outrage,

115
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.660
if you're that offended by what you're hearing on the radio or watching on TV or

116
00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:12.590
choosing to watch on a podcast, if you don't like it, turn the dial.

117
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.140
I don't want people turning the dial. I actually, I want to build my audience.

118
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.350
Um, but I'm not going to compromise who I am,

119
00:07:21.351 --> 00:07:25.760
what I want to say or the values I stand for because they're going to try to

120
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:29.270
intimidate me in silence, my voice. I'm not going to allow it. Um,

121
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.490
I am going to fight till my dying breath,

122
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.540
but I'll also fight for their right to do and say what they want to say.

123
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.600
They've lied. You know, the media in general,

124
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.850
they've 99% of them have been lying to the American people from the

125
00:07:43.851 --> 00:07:47.720
day that Donald Trump and Melania Trump came down that escalator at Trump tower.

126
