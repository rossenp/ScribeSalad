00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:09.380
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.290
<v 1>You talk specifically about the symptoms, cause we're hearing some,</v>

3
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.310
some conflicting information on that and then about the transmission part,

4
00:00:16.311 --> 00:00:18.350
because I think that's where people are most worried at the most.

5
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.340
<v 0>So the symptoms are going to be just like any cold or flu that you get.</v>

6
00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:27.260
They're going to be cough, fever, sore throat, maybe a runny nose,

7
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.230
maybe a little bit of GI symptoms, meaning nausea and vomiting,

8
00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:31.160
maybe some diarrhea.

9
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.980
And then shortness of breath is the one that we worry about in terms of

10
00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:37.520
pneumonia. Those are the main symptoms and they overlap a lot with influenza.

11
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.650
The contagiousness is that this is a disease that's pretty contagious compared

12
00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:45.650
to other Corona viruses like SARS and MERS, which were scary,

13
00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:47.240
but not very contagious between people.

14
00:00:47.241 --> 00:00:51.140
This is behaving more like the other Corona viruses that cause the common cold

15
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.660
meaning that it can be transmitted through costs and sneezes.

16
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.790
And on some of the surfaces that people have touched,

17
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.010
if they have caucus leaves on their hands, that's,

18
00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:01.700
what's making this more scary than any of the other coronavirus outbreaks that

19
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:02.720
we've dealt with in the past.

20
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.050
This is something that transmits very efficiently in the community.

21
00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:08.690
And that's why this is spreading to many, many different countries.

22
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.770
And it's not really a containable virus because of how easy it's spread and the

23
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:15.500
fact that many people have mild symptoms that are indistinguishable from the

24
00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:18.890
cold and they're out there doing things and spreading this around. So.

25
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.630
<v 1>That really the number one problem,</v>

26
00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:24.830
that there are probably many people that have this right now and they simply

27
00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:28.400
don't know. So then they are going to the supermarket, put their hand on,

28
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.700
you know, right by the cash register or something or payment processor.

29
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.380
And then next thing you know, they're transmitting.

30
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.150
<v 0>That's part of the issue. We know that this virus emerged in China,</v>

31
00:01:38.151 --> 00:01:39.770
at least around mid November,

32
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.770
which meant that it had been spreading probably for some time in the community.

33
00:01:42.771 --> 00:01:44.690
And we didn't, there was no restrictions or anything like that.

34
00:01:44.691 --> 00:01:45.860
People were traveling all over.

35
00:01:45.861 --> 00:01:49.670
So we know that this seeded many countries probably before we even knew knew it.

36
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.940
And we had a pretty severe flu season and because the symptoms are

37
00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:55.100
indistinguishable and most people have mild cases,

38
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.560
they were probably mixed in and not even diagnosed.

39
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.100
And there likely are many undiagnosed chains of transmission in the United

40
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.130
States that are starting to pop up. Now, like we saw in Washington state,

41
00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:07.610
for example, and that's the issue is that we didn't know who had this disease.

42
00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:10.340
So we couldn't tell them, you need to isolate yourself and protect,

43
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.200
protect yourself from infecting others.

44
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.740
Nobody did any of that in the early stages of this outbreak.

45
00:02:15.741 --> 00:02:16.940
And that's what we're left with now.

46
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.870
<v 1>Obviously in some unchartered territory with coronavirus and our plan here is to</v>

47
00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:24.320
help you make as much sense of the situation in a not alarmist fashion as

48
00:02:24.321 --> 00:02:24.891
possible.

49
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:28.610
