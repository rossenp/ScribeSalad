1
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.360
<v 1>In a world where no one wants to pay for cable anymore,</v>

2
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.710
a culture will rise where every dumb media company thinks you like them enough

3
00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:19.610
to become a paid subscriber. But until narrative media fails completely.

4
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.120
And we just stare at each other on social media all day, live through Ty.

5
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.590
When there's too much to watch,

6
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.390
the good stuff is hard to find and everything is going to cost you, ah,

7
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.780
progress. Every streaming service.

8
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.530
Remember the company who used to send you DVDs,

9
00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:38.270
that would sit unwatched on your coffee table.

10
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.870
Now they're a streaming service full of shows that will sit on washed in their

11
00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:46.580
own library where the employees and the shows all get asked after two years,

12
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.330
because they're too cheap to give the cast and crew a pay bomb and to flush with

13
00:00:50.331 --> 00:00:54.410
cash, to resist making a new show to boost signups in outer Mongolia. But Hey,

14
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.680
at least they've made some of your favorites resurrected some dead movies,

15
00:00:57.681 --> 00:00:58.460
genres,

16
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.970
and handed some great directors of blank check who cares that they're billions

17
00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:04.130
of dollars in debt when your company name is a verb,

18
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.840
the money printer goes Quickster from the

19
00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:11.960
network that brought you star Trek, the Twilight zone,

20
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.240
and 10,000 shows about crime solving.

21
00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:18.770
Acronyms comes a streaming service that's chock full of exactly that.

22
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.590
Plus a bunch of shows that were designed to sell denture cream,

23
00:01:21.591 --> 00:01:25.160
to viewers who haven't known, how to change the channel on their TV. Since 97,

24
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.940
it's a service who's been so fully ignored by non-Trekkies that their parent

25
00:01:28.941 --> 00:01:32.120
company is already changing the name. Good sign,

26
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.870
too many tracks get ready for NBC Universal's rushed late entry

27
00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:39.950
into the streaming race,

28
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.890
which was supposed to make its big debut with the Tokyo Olympics.

29
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.920
But instead limped out with a socially distance, 30 rock reunion,

30
00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:47.690
special promoting their other shows.

31
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.410
Do you know how many amazing shows I have on peacock alone?

32
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.480
That's a deal breaker ladies still,

33
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.060
if you're looking for classic NBC programs like friends,

34
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.760
Seinfeld an ER,

35
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.400
you also get an sure who already tried this model and it

36
00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:08.750
failed, but did they have a in their name? I think. I mean, not

37
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.040
have copped from the people who brought you.

38
00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:16.610
Everything in your apartment comes the only service in the streaming Wars.

39
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.570
Who's listening to everything you're doing. Alexa, let's chat.

40
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.770
See who brings you edgy acclaimed programming,

41
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.330
an unfathomable amount of absolute crap and free two-day shipping courtesy of a

42
00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:31.550
modern day, feudal peasant, but don't worry.

43
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.860
They're working on turning them into delivery drones,

44
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.890
which are just a Taree gun away from becoming murder drones.

45
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.980
I feel like Bezos is the only one taking the streaming Wars. Literally

46
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.990
Cyberdyne prime love YouTube,

47
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.010
but hate how free it is like Reno nine one, one, but wish there was less of it.

48
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.540
Then come on over to Quimby where you can watch new originals or just wait until

49
00:02:56.541 --> 00:03:00.310
they're ruthlessly mocked on Twitter. Like lady in love with her golden arm.

50
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.670
You've.

51
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.890
<v 0>Got to take off that prosthetic. No,</v>

52
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.610
I can't take off my golden arm effort.

53
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.600
<v 1>Third wave feminist six doll road trip.</v>

54
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.860
<v 0>Sorry.</v>

55
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.160
<v 1>Liquidy lacks in content and also lacks in anyone willing to pay for this.</v>

56
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.030
There isn't even any joy in this. It's like making fun of a sick dog.

57
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.090
Hope someone takes Quimby out for one last run around the park before it's too

58
00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:28.380
late. You're a good boy Queens. Okay. Maybe not good, but okay.

59
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:29.850
You're an okay boy.

60
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.110
Seven minutes in method. Hey you, yeah.

61
00:03:37.111 --> 00:03:41.490
You who needs an all new service. We know why we're both here together.

62
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.700
You don't want another new show to watch. You want to watch a show.

63
00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:47.100
Talk about that show. I do. I'm sorry.

64
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.730
Guilty as charged than maybe leave a naughty little comment down below.

65
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.600
Go ahead. Say whatever you want. Does Netflix let you do that?

66
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.860
Because a bunch of Sims, it only boost our engagement metrics.

67
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.600
Now let's get wild and see where the recommended videos take us. Ooh,

68
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.010
a flat earth essay.

69
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.210
You always know what the dumbest worst people are looking for.

70
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.250
America's saddest home videos. Do you like friends?

71
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.480
You better because showing the reruns cost about half a billion dollars.

72
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.820
So give some money to the service that still has all the great HBO shows the

73
00:04:23.821 --> 00:04:27.750
best of adults win and a huge chunk of the criterion collection.

74
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.460
But it's all being subsidized by the Dolors who want to watch this for the 900

75
00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:33.990
time? Are you doing.

76
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.840
<v 0>It's.</v>

77
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.220
<v 1>Funny because it's wait.</v>

78
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.390
Why is it funny friends with benefits?

79
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.150
Remember regular TV shows who remembers go green for the service that acts as a

80
00:04:48.151 --> 00:04:51.000
life rat for all the rapidly drowning cable channels,

81
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.970
plus originals that target the women who are going through a lot right now,

82
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.170
demographic with flexible options like paying to just watch Hulu paying,

83
00:04:58.171 --> 00:05:00.000
to watch Hulu without ads paying,

84
00:05:00.001 --> 00:05:04.710
to watch Hulu and live TV or paying to watch who in live TV with premium ad-ons

85
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.740
and okay, we're just back to being cable again. Are we the IC your game?

86
00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:12.330
Hulu Disney minors experience a higher

87
00:05:12.331 --> 00:05:16.500
caliber of programming crafted to meet the precise standards of the company

88
00:05:16.501 --> 00:05:18.690
behind the Thunderbolt to USB dongle,

89
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.190
the lightning to headphone Jack adapter and a thousand dollars steak

90
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.150
featuring storytelling. So refined and exclusive, nobody, you know,

91
00:05:27.151 --> 00:05:28.800
has ever seen or talked about it.

92
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.130
You can't tell me blind Aquaman Viking show and the office where Michael gets me

93
00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:32.970
to, to real,

94
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.550
this has to be part of some kind of elaborate tax game or something.

95
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.600
I pass once upon a time,

96
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.860
a magical company was drunk with power dominating the movie theaters,

97
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.190
cruise lines and the happiest place on earth for kids.

98
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.350
And we're at adults with too much time and money,

99
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.340
but then a play took all the revenue streams away and put all the pressure on

100
00:05:53.341 --> 00:05:55.230
the little streaming service that could,

101
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.870
but with the help of a few great shows of vault full of this Dolger and

102
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.970
literally nothing else of value,

103
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.290
you just might forget to unsubscribe long enough for the MCU stuff to come out.

104
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.630
The Mickey mouse hub, starring these other streaming services.

105
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:16.550
We didn't have time to mention too spooky for me, crackle still around.

106
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:17.271
Good for you.

107
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:21.920
Crackle sports without the actual games gangs without the actual

108
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:26.390
games, regular STV all over again. Only fans.

109
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.890
What? What's that one? I don't recognize that guys. Sorry.

110
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.340
And yeah, I don't know where you guys are even getting these from.

111
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.590
I've never heard of them personally. That's for sure. Every streaming service

112
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.120
let's just pray. These places never catch on that.

113
00:06:43.121 --> 00:06:44.710
We're all sharing the same account log in.

114
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.490
I'm going to steal the declaration of independence.

115
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.770
Everything is terrible. Your a Peaky blinder now.

116
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.670
So do not be sorry. Be better.

117
00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.040
Could my voice be any more dough? Yes, it can.
