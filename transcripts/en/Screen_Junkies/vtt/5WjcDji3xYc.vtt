silly jokes and simple life lessons that will delight your inner eight year old

9
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.140
because the show was made for actual eight year olds.

<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

11
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.280
<v 1>But who cares? I get my first born. If it meant we get a season four,</v>

12
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.080
why didn't they make a season four anyway,

13
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.790
[inaudible] And to real-world a four kingdoms each with its own stereotype.

14
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.650

Where warriors known as vendors can fling stuff around by doing karate next to

00:01:20.571 --> 00:01:24.350
it. Masters of martial arts can turn their bodies and delivering weapons

<v 1>Love is love is love is best not to think too hard about it.</v>

21
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.830
Everything changed when the fire nation attack 100 years ago and then

22
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.600
nothing changed for like 95 years because neither side is making progress.

23
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.750
Now only the avatar can end the Spire Fest once and for all a

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.810
<v 0>The avatar is far more important.</v>

48
00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:31.170
This cowards a hundred years in hiding are over and I want the avatar I'm

49
00:03:31.171 --> 00:03:35.490
chasing the avatar. Where's the avatar S standing view.

50
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.940
The only view I'm interested in seeing is the avatar chains.

51
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.130
<v 1>Oh, we get it already. I didn't.</v>

52
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.320
<v 0>Capture the avatar. Who cares.</v>

true delights.

57
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.860
Your beauty's intoxicating or more key please.

58
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.160
In case someone brings home a lady friend,

59
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.660
this is the best tea in the city. The secret ingredient is love.

60
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.790
I didn't see you get hit with the tongue.

61
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.120
<v 1>These two will carry the emotional and dramatic weight of the series with</v>

62
00:04:18.121 --> 00:04:22.290
satisfying character arcs that will bring tears of joy and sadness to your eyes.

63
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.140
And then there's the other two they're just mean,

64
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.940
do you like overarching stories or are you more of an episodic plot person to

65
00:04:29.941 --> 00:04:33.900
that avatar answers? Yes. As the show balances,

66
00:04:33.901 --> 00:04:38.400
serving the main quest with a weekly dose of villages that need help villages

67
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.460
that get burned down because they helped Saka complaining.

It's not like I'm a preachy cry baby.

70
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:51.780
You can't resist giving over emotional speeches about hope all the time.

71
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.920
I know sometimes it hurts more to home and it hurts more to care,

72
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.190
but you have to promise me that you won't stop caring.

73
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.610
<v 1>Searching for a teacher to help him master the elements.</v>

74
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.280
Even though what he really needs is a master to help with his blood sugar

75
00:05:05.281 --> 00:05:06.114
issues.

76
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.170
<v 0>Sorry, we got your back. Thanks.</v>

77
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.260
<v 1>Navigant agent breakfast before you fight the fire Lord.</v>

78
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.310
So celebrate the show that challenged kids with difficult things.

79
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.630
<v 0>Duty calls you to sacrifice your own spiritual needs.</v>

80
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.820
<v 1>In between all the goofy sound effects.</v>

81
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.530
That's probably the closest thing we have to a successor to star Wars and that

82
00:05:49.531 --> 00:05:53.850
the original is beloved, but nitpicked and the SQL a bunch of people off. Oh,

83
00:05:53.851 --> 00:05:56.880
well at least no one will ever try to make a live action adaptation ever again.

84
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.250
Why must we fly so close to the sun story?

85
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.320
The nature boy. Whoa. This is Kotara.

86
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.360
She's got my back. Okay. Boomerang Bay fond footballing phone pong,

Chan and Ron. John. No joke here. Just a big fan. Netflix synergy.

93
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.730
<v 0>It's just a river of lava. Hey phase,</v>

94
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.510

<v 0>Your final test is Andrew.</v>

97
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.730
And let this be the end of this rivalry.

98
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.160
I'll be outside if you're man enough to fight me, stand on, fight avatar. Oh,

99
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.890
where are we fighting? Do you really want to fight me?

100
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.130
I really do do each other.

101
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:22.210
I order you to fight an Agni Chi, but

102
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:25.293
spirits, dog,

103
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.870

<v 1>Earth, wind and fire</v>

110
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:41.573
Nan. The show is okay,

111
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.630
but I think they should've gone with the original four elements.

<v 0>Smoke, slime, fire and stink,</v>

113
