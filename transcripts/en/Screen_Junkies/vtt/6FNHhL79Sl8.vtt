00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.180
Except for that one mural screen movie he made

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.670
True crime podcast. We're books.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.250
<v 1>There's murder was last year's hottest court case.</v>

14
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.630
Somebody was going to write a book about it.

15
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.030
<v 0>And without Twitter movie dorks had to get creative.</v>

16
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.350
When it came to harassing women.

17
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.430
<v 1>What's your favorite scary movie? I don't know. Jason's mother,</v>

18
00:01:13.431 --> 00:01:16.880
Mrs. Borys was the original killer wrong answer.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.510
<v 0>It is. When we were made today, the mask will be an enemy avatar meet Sydney.</v>

20
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.930
The Virgin is Virgin, whoever Virgin and Tommy.

21
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.850
<v 1>We can tell them on top of the cross stock.</v>

22
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.220
<v 0>But this sweet innocent girl is cursed with a worst social group of all</v>

23
00:01:34.221 --> 00:01:37.160
time. There's Tata eyes. I mean, Tatum,

24
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.770
who's more concerned with party than helping her friend.

25
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.250
<v 1>The party night. My house are you serious?</v>

26
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.290
Come on for me.

27
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.510
<v 0>Who was dealing with way scarier stuff off camera than on Billy of</v>

28
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:53.570
big Johnny Depp enthusiast. This screen junkies fan.

29
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.380
<v 1>Obviously they don't watch enough movies. It's a standard horror movie stuff.</v>

30
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.790
There's a formula to it. A very simple formula. This Cox,

31
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.740
when I say hurry, please interpret that as move your fat top of lard.

32
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.350
<v 0>And Stu a guy who does some of the most upsetting mouse stuff in horror since</v>

33
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.980
ichi the killer deal with.

34
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.620
<v 1>Never a road.</v>

35
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.570
<v 0>Yeah, no. Come to think of it. Everyone at this school was a monster.</v>

36
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.320
<v 1>Fairness would be to rip your insides out.</v>

37
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.100
They found principle Henry gutted and hung from the goalpost. That's cool.

38
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.900
<v 0>Except the cop weirdly. He's the only cool one.</v>

39
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.063
<v 1>Have a good time.</v>

40
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.180
<v 0>Suit up with a slasher. Who's all killer, no filler.</v>

41
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.630
Because while some horror icons spend their time talking trash

42
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.790
Or doing spooky vanishing acts,

43
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.580
This Ghostface Killah just bought the first mass they saw on the way to school.

44
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.860
<v 1>He settled his costume every five and dime.</v>

45
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.330
<v 0>The state giving you know,</v>

46
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:09.160
safe spaces as he stalks you all over town from the shrubbery outside of your

47
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:11.530
own house, to the ladies rooms,

48
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.640
to the grocery store in broad daylight,

49
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.410
we have a slasher on how for and busted to every fight night. First,

50
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.280
without a plan beyond stabby stabby, you got to respect the hustle.

51
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.110
Even if everyone is constantly beating the crap out of him.

52
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.700
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

53
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.050
<v 0>So heat up some Jiffy pop and revisit the classic that's packed full of nods to</v>

54
00:03:55.051 --> 00:03:56.100
other horror movies.

55
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.040
<v 1>What'd you call me not your friend.</v>

56
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.900
<v 0>And when they can't think of a nod,</v>

57
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.510
they just say the name of a horror movie like out loud.

58
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.970
<v 1>Excersice was on the town that dreaded sundown nightmare on Elm street.</v>

59
00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:12.030
So I went to the land terror train, but Howard psycho

60
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.850
Candyman, scary Halloween. And what movie is this from? I spit on your garage.

61
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.650
<v 0>In this innovative slasher that rescued a genre that was groaning in bad sequels</v>

62
00:04:22.651 --> 00:04:26.760
and remakes only to eventually drown in its own sequels and remakes,

63
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.990
but still it not only saved horror at the time it managed to kill off the spoof

64
00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:33.600
movie too. Do you like spooky movies?

65
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.310
<v 1>You should see how we be.</v>

66
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.000
<v 0>Not anymore story.</v>

67
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.770
I know who your mom did last summer. Never been killed. Oh,

68
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.030
I'll be there for you when the blood starts to pool. Oh, excuse me,

69
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.500
Mr. Orange and a grudge, uh, fields,

70
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.660
mountain Dewey.

71
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.310
[inaudible] ghost slice principles and Mark Walberg

72
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.570
talks to animals.

73
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.510
<v 1>So you love your mother. Okay. Donkey.</v>

74
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.850
<v 0>Scary movie. What? That's, what they were actually going to call it.</v>

75
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.080
You know, what's really the scariest part of the movie.

76
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.000
This cheerleader who takes a dome,

77
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.200
then sticks her finger in her mouth without washing her ends.

78
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.950
