00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.530
<v 1>This video is presented by fistula bourbon</v>

2
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.280
From human thumb, Joss Wheaton,

3
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.140
the man responsible for Buffy the Avengers and the Snyder cut

4
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.680
comes the groundbreaking Saifai series that got canceled,

5
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.390
but like traditionally canceled,

6
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.400
not just weekend canceled Firefly returned

7
00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:33.200
to a tie when studios weren't catering to a nerds, every women fantasy. In fact,

8
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.100
they couldn't even be bothered to air this stuff in order and explore a budget.

9
00:00:37.101 --> 00:00:39.980
Really riff on star Wars, not playing anymore.

10
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.450
<v 0>Anybody makes so much.</v>

11
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.091
<v 1>Here.</v>

12
00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:48.590
A 20 group of heroic rebels fought a war for independence against the Alliance,

13
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.040
which I'm sure was fought over planet's rights or something.

14
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.740
Maybe don't think too hard about the whole Confederacy and space thing.

15
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.260
I'm thinking will rise again, uh,

16
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.600
suit up and your dustiest Browns in pages with a crew of the serenity,

17
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.740
a that looks like an up gizmo dog. There's Malcolm Reynolds,

18
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.580
the captain who's quick on the draw and even quicker to lose his temper.

19
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.330
<v 0>If we can get to that bridge, are you going to get us back on our feet?</v>

20
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.570
We'll keep a civil time in that mouth around. So it's shucked gag her.

21
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.030
If you have to the wandering about remembering, well,

22
00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:23.300
stick it back in your crate, shut up. Feel bad.

23
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.600
He makes everybody cry like a monster.

24
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.110
<v 1>Jane, a white trash star screen cat nine are out.</v>

25
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.440
<v 0>Calling the shots. I'm in interrupting charge here.</v>

26
00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:37.580
And I'm telling you how it works.

27
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.500
I guess that makes me that's a concept to wrap your head

28
00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:43.334
around.

29
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.130
<v 1>Simon, a cup of plain yogurt. Who's super into his sister. My sister.</v>

30
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.200
<v 0>Who's a genius. She was a gift.</v>

31
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.380
I don't think my last act in this versus going to be betraying my sister.

32
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.260
<v 1>Shepherd book, who wasn't always a shepherd. You know.</v>

33
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.230
<v 0>Now how would a shepherd know a name like that? And we'll look at these wounds.</v>

34
00:02:00.231 --> 00:02:02.120
I'd say 54, our sniper rifle.

35
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.760
We do a lot of shooting at the Abbey there shepherd one day.

36
00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:07.490
You're going to tell us all how a preacher knows so much about crime,

37
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:08.683
that it was shepherd.

38
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.850
<v 1>Allen today as himself.</v>

39
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.320
<v 0>Oh dear God. No.</v>

40
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.160
<v 1>And if you were wondering if there were any female characters, come on,</v>

41
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.280
this is a Wieden show. The ship has every kind of jaws woman,

42
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.470
the sexy fighting one. Okay.

43
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.570
<v 0>People, if it moves.</v>

44
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.850
<v 1>Shooting, the sexy adorkable was.</v>

45
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.320
<v 0>That's the buffet table. Well, how can we be sure unless we question it.</v>

46
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.350
<v 1>The sexy, sexy one.</v>

47
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.660
<v 0>Most of my clientele is male. Do.</v>

48
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.493
<v 1>You know that?</v>

49
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.800
And the sexy living weapon with a brain of a child who just woke up from a

50
00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:44.480
nightmare because you do seem a little.

51
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.960
<v 0>River.</v>

52
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.670
<v 1>You know, it's a shame. This got canceled after one season,</v>

53
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.710
we'll know which one has a barren room. Do you like quippy dialogue?

54
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.310
Then you're in luck because if this falls under 50 quips in hour,

55
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.990
it's rig to explode,

56
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.710
strap it in with nonstop banter that would make Kevin Smith and Diablo Cody's

57
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:12.610
noses bleed,

58
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.390
and then cheer on the talented cast that makes it worth turning every type of

59
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:20.590
possible. Quit into television gold like sarcastic quips.

60
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.090
<v 0>I always hoped you. Two kids would get together. Who is she?</v>

61
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.370
<v 1>Snarky. Quips. Thank you. You can stoop.</v>

62
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.760
<v 0>To be in alone while you wash it. First sassy quips.</v>

63
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.700
That sounds like something out of science fiction. You live in a spaceship.

64
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.300
<v 1>And the old Josh Wieden three-step. So when makes a statement,</v>

65
00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.120
something contradicts that statement. Funny reaction.

66
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.430
<v 0>Don't ever let them know where you are.</v>

67
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.570
They won't discover it till they go on to the next round of drinks way.

68
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.790
Good drinker. That one. We're going back.

69
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.320
<v 1>Oh, that's a spicy of weed and climb a board serenity for plenty of action and</v>

70
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.030
mayhem. As the crew takes the job. What are we doing? Oh, crime hopes.

71
00:04:03.031 --> 00:04:05.130
The ship doesn't fall apart. You'll have enough to buy.

72
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.380
<v 0>Your own ship better one than this piece of crap.</v>

73
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.500
Whatever you enter this or talk junker.

74
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.830
You paid money for this sir on purpose. What do you mean.

75
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.110
<v 1>River pools? A weird can kill you with my brain mal uh,</v>

76
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.640
flirts with an aura.

77
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.430
<v 0>They teach you that in horror Academy. Well,</v>

78
00:04:23.431 --> 00:04:24.750
I don't suppose you're the only hard.

79
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.760
<v 1>That day. Someone mentions the war.</v>

80
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.050
<v 0>What were you in the war Wars over for some that won't ever be fought in the war</v>

81
00:04:31.051 --> 00:04:33.510
together, right? So I'm on board here. for the independence.

82
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.630
I love the fact that you two are old army buddies and you have wacky stories.

83
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.110
<v 1>The job goes South and everyone draws their guns.</v>

84
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.200
Someone gets almost dead now.

85
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.480
<v 0>Yep. He's dead.</v>

86
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.510
<v 1>And someone says something to Mel.</v>

87
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.680
He dramatically turns and repeats it to himself.

88
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.980
<v 0>We've got good. I call it a swim. Right?</v>

89
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.260
<v 1>And you know what it works. I can give about the show. Oh, I want one.</v>

90
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.430
Look to that, man. Summarized.

91
00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.830
Next thing I know I've got a Brown coat and the Gorham officially licensed

92
00:05:19.831 --> 00:05:23.910
monopoly game. So walk the verse for a spell with Firefly.

93
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.750
The show that laid the groundwork for so much of today's pop culture,

94
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.250
including how to throw tantrums.

95
00:05:29.251 --> 00:05:31.170
If they ever tried to take our stuff away again,

96
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.070
but ironically owes its legacy to being taken off the air too soon,

97
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.200
because let's face it on a long enough timeline.

98
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.470
Every fan would have gone full river. Eventually first season of Firefly,

99
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.140
it was fine. I guess seasons two through five nuts.

100
00:05:43.141 --> 00:05:45.570
A much Nathan feeling really needs to do something new,

101
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.250
like a quirky crime procedural.

102
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.010
<v 0>What exactly are you supposed to be?</v>

103
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.950
<v 1>Space cowboy story. James T quirk.</v>

104
00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.770
Alan Zilles extraordinary punch list. Jane and hats.

105
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.580
Princess Leia. Zoe spacial Hill.

106
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.370
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

107
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.450
<v 1>Go Ram it Jim. I'm a doctor. Not a space. Ravine, Leeloo,</v>

108
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.213
Rutten, no rubble.

109
00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.320
<v 0>No running way. Oh, run away. You're running full</v>

110
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.600
lasers. Where's my money. My sister's brain was running playground.

111
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.930
<v 1>Zac Efron, Gorham, something, something.</v>

112
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.470
<v 0>[Inaudible] respond to this. We need some core. I'm here to support. 10 is</v>

113
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.980
[inaudible]. If you have a good go around

114
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.980
 where you think you're not my grandma on my grandma ship. Shiny. You look

115
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:40.980
 shiny. Katherine, where a shiny hat, shiny presence

116
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:41.813
, shiny, shiny, shiny, shiny, shiny, shiny.

117
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:57.970
<v 1>Goods and cargo. The.</v>

118
00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:58.960
<v 0>Goods must be attacked.</v>

119
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:02.320
This girl is a smallest cargo I've ever had to transport. It was damaged goods.

120
00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:06.870
Anyhow, Jane helped with the cargo cargo cargo, cargo goods, cargo,

121
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.750
cargo goods, cargo cargo, Chinese stuff.

122
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.203
[inaudible].

123
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.370
<v 1>Chinese people with speaking roles.</v>

124
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.110
<v 0>Now she's my wife. Are you getting my wife into trouble?</v>

125
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.090
I'm not flying anywhere without my wife.

126
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.850
Could you please tell my wife the fun she's missing out on?

127
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:48.010
Everything's laid out. If you'd like to cook for your husband.

128
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:54.010
<v 1>And welcome to the rough Dax, secondhand roughnecks,</v>

129
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.110
just in space.

130
00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.630
<v 0>Okay. This is what you were trying to make. Let's see what you did.</v>

131
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.930
Couldn't get a hold of no flour. So it's mostly protein.

132
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:12.430
<v 1>This video is presented by fiscal the bourbon. It ain't just a bourbon.</v>

133
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.480
It's a festival. I smoked my stove, cheese anywhere.

134
00:08:16.481 --> 00:08:19.990
I want person, woman, man,

135
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.670
camera TV. Oh man. I shot Marvin in the face.

136
00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.940
He's just standing there menacingly.
