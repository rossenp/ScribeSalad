<v 0>It flopped in theaters. It barely made sense.</v>

00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:14.210
The first three times you watched it,

3
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.950
but if you're a film nerd of a certain age or a very, with a dark side,

4
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.070
then you love Donnie Darko.

5
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.210
We visit the Colt classic. You watched on DVD.

6
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.740
So dudes would stop saying way you've never seen Donnie Darko than corner you.

7
00:00:30.741 --> 00:00:32.900
While they try to explain it in this field,

8
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.360
they gave millennials their first taste of art house,

9
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:39.620
weirdness their first crush on Agilon hall and their first awakening slash

10
00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:42.470
confirmation of their inner mall. God, they don't play it.

11
00:00:42.471 --> 00:00:45.380
Cool because it came out 20 years ago. We all have an inner mall. Goth

12
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.480
me, Donnie Darko, a name so cool.

13
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.490
You got to say the whole thing every time. Donnie Darko, Donnie Darko,

14
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.300
Donnie Darko, Donnie Darko. What was his name? Donny.

15
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.100
Donny like most teenagers. He thinks he's a misunderstood genius.

16
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.200
Your Iowa test scores are intimidating. tiny. Why?

17
00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:12.020
Why do you got to get so smart on us? Who's so special.

18
00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:15.470
The fate of the entire world revolves around his choices,

19
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.010
but unlike every other teenager, he's right.

20
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.970
Cause Donny doesn't just blow grumps minds with his knowledge bomb can just lump

21
00:01:22.971 --> 00:01:25.040
things into two categories. Things aren't that simple.

22
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.030
He's also a superhero stuck in a parallel universe who needs to send a duplicate

23
00:01:29.031 --> 00:01:32.540
jet engine back in time through a portal with the power of telekinesis or

24
00:01:32.541 --> 00:01:36.950
reality is doomed. Okay. So none of that is shown in the movie per se,

25
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.800
but if you watch the director's cut and pause it during the excerpts from the

26
00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:42.290
philosophy of time travel, it's pretty obvious that anyway, wait,

27
00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:43.550
where are you going? Come on.

28
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.070
They don't want to go back to my dorm and listen to that mad world song.

29
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.640
I've got more theories return to the eighties,

30
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.980
but not in an annoying stranger things kind of way.

31
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.240
Just a bunch of timely Michael Dukakis references. I'm voting for new caucus.

32
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.300
You want to say things Michael Dukakis will provide for this country to you

33
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.143
ready to squeeze one out.

34
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.970
But I want to be a president of the United States and thrill when bugs bunny on

ketamine arrives to give Donnie 28 days to save the world.

36
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.210
[inaudible] then like most kids,

37
00:02:14.211 --> 00:02:16.820
his age waits until the last six hours to do anything about it.

38
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.150
Time is running out. We got to come to fulfill his destiny.

39
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.320
He'll need help from Patrick Swayze trying his hardest to make you not like him.

40
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.680
Does that. All the gusta you can muster. I said, good morning.

41
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.290
Firefighters discovered what has been referred to as a kitty corn done.

42
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.790
Okay, fine. This messy English teacher who loves drama.

43
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.980
Sit next to the boy. You think is the cutest.

44
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.790
This school girlfriend who falls asleep at the beginning of evil dead.

45
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.990
That's a deal breaker fellows and Seth Rogen before he'd smoked the edges of his

46
00:02:47.991 --> 00:02:51.680
personality. Then your dad like stab your mom.

47
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.850
This is really hard to watch. I like your boots, huh? It's horrible.

48
00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.970
Get them in a dab fast. Oh, that's better.

49
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.620
So bust out your skeleton shirt and throw on some tears for fears for the

50
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.250
ultimate Colt classic, they got buried. Cause October,

51
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.310
2001 was a bad time to release an airplane crash movie,

52
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.230
but it's so unique and open-ended,

53
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.100
you can go deeper into your own theories with every rewatch until you finally

54
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:22.720
grow out of it and take on the real challenge. Making sense of the creators.

55
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.710
Other big movie.

<v 2>Papa Smurf didn't create Smurfette Gargamel did.</v>

whole gang-bang scenario, I just was so illogical, you know, Mercer,

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.390
asexual. They don't even have, what's the point of living reproductive organs.

72
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.940
If you don't have, it's just going to happen.

So you can walk home together. You can just say hi,
