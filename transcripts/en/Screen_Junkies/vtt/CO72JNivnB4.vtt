00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.540
<v 1>From your unproblematic fave, Tina Fey,</v>

2
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.170
from your slightly problematic fave, Tina Fey.

3
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.250
<v 0>A hundred years from now, people will see my work and think, wow,</v>

4
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.570
that is actually pretty racist.

5
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.130
<v 1>Comes a ruthless tale of pointless cruelty, full of miserable teenagers,</v>

6
00:00:25.131 --> 00:00:27.140
trapped in a Hill of their own creation.

7
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.850
Basically the most honest high school movie ever made mean girls

8
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.590
move over breakfast club so long clueless. And who said,

9
00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:40.190
you could sit with us Netflix girls because it's time for one of the best high

10
00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:43.010
school movies of the early two thousands. In fact,

11
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.350
one of the best things from the early two thousands,

12
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.100
but that really isn't saying much. Let's just get the nostalgia for that decade.

13
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.330
Okay. Trust us bet. Before Lohan was making reality shows,

14
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.760
pop albums and court appearances.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.260
And before Rachel McAdams was getting some strange, they were in mean girls,

16
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.580
the funniest comedy to ever be adapted from a non-fiction parenting advice book

17
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.390
in this hilarious satire that could either be viewed as a plea for teen girls to

18
00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:12.350
be more kind to each other or an instruction manual for future sociopaths.

19
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.760
It could really use an update though.

20
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.960
Like how do I destroy the thought of does my junk coupon cam please advise

21
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.430
welcome to one of the most racially segregated high schools in Illinois.

22
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.570
<v 0>The nerds cool Asians, unfriendly black hotties.</v>

23
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.800
<v 1>Where the popular girls are cruel. God, Karen you're so stupid.</v>

24
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.680
The unpopular girls are vengeful and manipulative.

25
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.570
<v 0>And you're best friends against her.</v>

26
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.850
And we gave you a foot cream instead of face washes.

27
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.980
<v 1>The teachers are statutory rapists and the bus drivers really want</v>

28
00:01:42.981 --> 00:01:44.540
to get kids to school on time.

29
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.150
<v 0>Shove it right up your hair.</v>

30
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.670
<v 1>Tossed into this jungle is Katie she's from Africa.</v>

31
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.730
I just moved here from Africa, which country, you know,

32
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.800
Africa shut up.

33
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.690
She doesn't know about basic things like fashion cliques or African-Americans

34
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.370
jumbo because she was homeschooled by the parents from get out.

35
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.010
<v 0>The fertility files I put in the belly tribe.</v>

36
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.680
I would have voted for Obama for a third term.

37
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.730
<v 1>Watch Katie enlist, the help of her gay best friend and her friend.</v>

38
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.740
Who's mortified. People wouldn't even think she's gay.

39
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.320
<v 0>I feel like you're like in love with me or something.</v>

40
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.990
<v 1>Not to infiltrate the popular clique known as the plastics, uh,</v>

41
00:02:29.991 --> 00:02:32.450
group of Abercrombie and is led by Regina,

42
00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:36.920
George who so mean you'll barely care. When the hero Stoker eating disorder.

43
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.530
<v 0>I'm only eating foods with less than 30% calories from fat.</v>

44
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.030
I really want to lose three pounds.

45
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.180
Let's go the South beach fat flush and all you drink is cranberry juice for 72

46
00:02:44.181 --> 00:02:45.014
hours.

47
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.040
<v 1>Karen Smith, the second dumbest weather reporter from a 2004 film.</v>

48
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.940
<v 0>Said 30% shifted, sorry,</v>

49
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.130
rating and 38 degrees in the middle.

50
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.770
<v 1>And Gretchen wieners who ironically,</v>

51
00:02:57.771 --> 00:03:00.130
isn't the girl who made out with a hot made out.

52
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.300
<v 0>With a hot dog. Oh my God. That was one time.</v>

53
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.273
<v 1>Together.</v>

54
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.080
These Von duchesses will ruthlessly scheme to stay popular in a

55
00:03:10.081 --> 00:03:13.410
fiendish plot to, uh, that's pretty much it,

56
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.630
but they wrote some mean stuff in a private journal years ago.

57
00:03:15.631 --> 00:03:19.860
So monsters follow along on Katie's uncomfortably,

58
00:03:19.861 --> 00:03:24.420
true to life evolution from wholesome silver kid to out of control party girl,

59
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.310
as she steals a guy so nice.

60
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.910
He dated Regina twice gets a teacher arrested. I.

61
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.460
<v 0>Bet she sells drugs on the side to be for pathetic divorce.</v>

62
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.810
<v 1>And incites a riot,</v>

63
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.620
but it's nothing a single apology and an afternoon of trust balls. Can't pigs.

64
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.880
See now everyone is friends with everyone. Oh, it's still full quicks.

65
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.260
Just the members changed. Well,

66
00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:44.850
at least they can kill the ones who get too powerful.

67
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.100
So revisit one of the most quotable movies of all time.

68
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.240
<v 0>Cool. Stop trying to make fetch happen. It's not going to happen.</v>

69
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.163
You'll go Glenn.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.940
<v 1>Call that leans on the strings of great future stars and just the right amount</v>

71
00:03:59.941 --> 00:04:03.840
of SNL people to anchor a field with a wise and lasting message.

72
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.090
Math is for losers.

73
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.270
<v 0>No, no, no. Mathletes. I pretended to be bad at maths that you'd help me.</v>

74
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.940
I didn't join those stupid math leaks. I'm a math leap.

75
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.380
A nerd is birth detention, mathletes it's social suicide. Thanks Damien.

76

Do the oysters come with guns?

87
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.730
I like my eggs crunchy.
