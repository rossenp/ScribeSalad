the explanation that they're actually an underground experiment,

45
00:03:15.781 --> 00:03:20.400
raises a few questions. Why is there a tethered for everyone in America?

how are they executing his complicated plan? If so,

53
00:03:33.331 --> 00:03:34.470
why did they bother staying on the ground?

54
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.180
Did the people who make the teller forget to lock the door on the way out?
