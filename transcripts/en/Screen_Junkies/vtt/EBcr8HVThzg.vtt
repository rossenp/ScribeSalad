an evolving consumer dynamic new law.

5

And remember,

6
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.190
move on the girl who used her wits and determination to grow strong and save an

7
00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:33.020
empire. Forget her and beat this natural born killer killer.

8
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.130
Who's just waiting for an excuse to kick something sharp through your chest.

9
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.113
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.303
<v 1>Oh, and while we're at it,</v>

11
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.010
you may as well forget all those songs you loved and your first animated crush

12
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.760

Musu if any film need as many Murphy to lighten the mood, it's this one. Okay.

vibrant colors and sumptuous landscapes.

17
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.240
That will be totally wasted on your crappy TV.

18
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.620
As you soak in locations from the beautiful forest of New Zealand to some of the

19
00:01:09.621 --> 00:01:11.390
most stunning regions of China,

20
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.820
ignore that in this gorgeously rendered cinematic experience that continues the

21
00:01:16.821 --> 00:01:20.300
live action Disney tradition of being a cliff notes version of a story.

22
00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:21.200
You already know

23
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.350
[inaudible] up for the big fireworks finale. Oh, they cut that too.

24
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.570
That's a shame follow Milan on as she goes undercover in

25
00:01:32.571 --> 00:01:33.830
the world of men.

26
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.813
<v 2>You're a good man.</v>

27
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.630
<v 1>Which as all men know is a world of grab,</v>

28
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.000
cuddling and sniffing each other's necks.

29
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.890
What you guys don't sniff your bros to pay fine more next for me.

30
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.260
Oh yeah. Where this time the entire cast is refreshingly Asian,

31
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.960
including the exact opposite of Harvey Fierstein.

32
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.670
<v 2>My women buxom.</v>

33
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.770
<v 1>As we watch Mulan struggle against the constraints of a sexist empire</v>

34
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.661
until she lives.

35
00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:07.610
Her truth rises like a Phoenix and fights to preserve the same empire

36
00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:08.450
that oppressed her.

37
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.350
<v 2>Sort of thing with women in any way, penalty, that.</v>

38
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.170
<v 1>Then becomes an official tool of that oppression.</v>

39
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.350
<v 2>Join our greatest decorated wards and the emperor is gone.</v>

40
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.600
<v 1>Hashtag girl boss prepare for two hours of people talking about their cheese.</v>

41
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.660
<v 2>The chief of base the universe and all living things,</v>

42
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.650
but she's powerful watching cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap,

43
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.990

<v 1>Well Milan crosses swords with this Inigo Montoya want to be in honor of my</v>

45
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.683
life.

46
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.090
<v 0>Yes.</v>

47
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.670
<v 1>Well you will die. And this awesome bird lady</v>

48
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.090
whose unique perspective on the nexus of power and womanhood is way too nuanced

49
00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:53.960
to survive the movie. But Hey, this is a war film at its heart.

50
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.930
People are going to die and most of them thanks to move on.

51
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.340
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

52
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.020
<v 1>So saddle up with Disney's latest live action remake that tries to be a fantasy</v>

53
00:03:19.021 --> 00:03:21.030
Kung Fu movie, a war, Epic,

54
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.770
a fun kit's wig and an ODA female empowerment yet doesn't explore any one of

55
00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:28.470
those lanes deeply enough to be satisfying, but Hey,

56
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.250
at least it went over well in China, right? Wasn't that the point I'll come on,

57
00:03:32.251 --> 00:03:34.560
Disney. How did he get out? Pandered by Michael Bay.

58
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.600
Now this is a master at work.

59
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.520
<v 0>We got to call the central government for help.</v>

60
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.250

Nick Schmidt and Winston Falcon punch.

63
00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.840
You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain

64
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.720
two lawns. Hmm. Yes.

65
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.770
A tiny net is a desert ends and a gender reveal party.

66
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.523
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

67
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.230
<v 1>The emperor's new dude.</v>

68
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.090
Only one of the four riders in this was a man.

69
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.940
And I'm bet it was his idea for muon to let her hair down before a fight,

70
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.350
the buns are strategic. Dude. Do you know your moose shoes from your zoos?
