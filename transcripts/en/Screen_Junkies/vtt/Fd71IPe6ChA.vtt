00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.010
<v 1>Amazon studios invites you to enter the most brutal harsh</v>

2
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.440
unforgiving world. Since Amazon's warehouses in the boys.

3
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.620
See what the DC universe would look like.

4
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.050
If Zach Snyder never had to take a studio note.

5
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.830
<v 0>My grandchildren got incinerated Lamplighter at the birth of my life.</v>

6
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.600
So thoroughly they weren't even tickling.

7
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.790
<v 1>Where Superman is a stone cold psychopath wonder woman is a jaded alcoholic.</v>

8
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.140
The flash is a junkie. Who's lost his edge. Aquaman is a sexual predator.

9
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.360
Martian Manhunter is a creepy perv.

10
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.440
Batman is pretty much the same and they all worked for a company with the

11
00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:48.770
outward facing cheerful, Polish of Disney, but the internal money,

12
00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:51.770
hungry killer instinct Tov also Disney.

13
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.540
<v 0>Sequel. After sequel, after sequel.</v>

14
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.840
<v 1>Step into the adorkable shoes of Huey.</v>

15
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.170
He's a pansy who comes from a long proud line of pansies.

16
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.950
<v 0>You don't have the fight. You'd never have either do I.</v>

17
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.790
<v 1>Who's cultivated the power to back out of literally everything.</v>

18
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.830
<v 0>I don't want to go to a second location with you.</v>

19
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.720
I don't think I can do this anymore. I need to go home. No, no, no, I can't.

20
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.230
I can't do this. No, no, no, no, no. I can't do this. I can't do this.

21
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.280
<v 1>But Huey will go full Batman. When they kill off his Robin</v>

22
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.450
and joined the boys of vigilante group dedicated to keeping superheroes in

23
00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:35.300
line. And by in line, we mean dead

24
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.930
featuring this extremely French guy. And when we see.

25
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.600
<v 0>You, don't stir you fold. That's what makes them Sparky.</v>

26
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.630
<v 1>This extremely into his girlfriend guy is if you want.</v>

27
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.960
<v 0>Watch that episode of Downton Abbey, then I'm going to be one behind them.</v>

28
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.030
We're not going to be able to binge watch together. You know,

29
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.660
I'd much rather be at home, rubbing on them, toes, baby. I just you're right.

30
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:57.703
You're right.

31
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.420
<v 1>This extremely MacGuffin girl and this cogni a-hole who everyone is extremely</v>

32
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.040
unhappy to see compared to.

33
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.410
<v 0>In your promotion, Susan, what are you doing here?</v>

34
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.480
I thought we agreed that you were never going to come out here.

35
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.850
Easy bros at 40,000. Yummy. I mean,

36
00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:18.560
why else would you show your face around here? Oh, hell nah. Do you want, yeah,

37
00:02:18.561 --> 00:02:22.700
like the mold on my laundry room tiles, you scrape it up.

38
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.840
Comes right back.

39
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.970
<v 1>No, come to think of it. No, one's happy to see each other on the show.</v>

40
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.980
I guess friendship just isn't edging enough.

41
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.720
<v 0>Until this frog. This was coming.</v>

42
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.840
<v 1>Speaking of edge,</v>

43
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.250
prepare for a show that feels like it was written by these two sneaks up on the

44
00:02:43.251 --> 00:02:44.084
deep.

45
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.050
<v 0>And the boom down makes us shark bite transitions.</v>

46
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.100
<v 1>So that isn't content with just showing how superheroes would use their powers</v>

47
00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:56.000
for evil, but give them humanizing backstories and achieve ploy for sympathy.

48
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.380
Like how this disgraced white collar criminal has a kid.

49
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.640
Remember your old man or how the sexual deviant has a kid spends.

50
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.040
<v 0>Most of his free time with his son. He's got a son.</v>

51
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.580
<v 1>Or how this mass murderer as a kid, your father,</v>

52
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.970
or how this mass murdering corporate officer, you get the point.

53
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.150
I hear season two has a literal Nazi. Join the team, but don't worry.

54
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.330
I'm sure she wants to have kids someday, but in the darkness,

55
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.130
there is Starlight the newest hero in town with a power to cut down the VFX

56
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:26.410
budget by blinding the entire screen.

57
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.700
Watch her follow the girl in her first semester of college hero's journey.

58
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.590
Show us your and grow from unbelievably wide-eyed and naive to woke Epic

59
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:37.690
Gnostic Renegade. In the span of two months,

60
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.160
I'm done pretending only to find that our activism can be co-opted repackaged

61
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.830
and soul by the very forces she was fighting. Again.

62
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.530
<v 0>Watch her stand up and fight back for all of us.</v>

63
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.320
Citizens Starlight coming this ball.

64
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.030
<v 1>This is why capitalism remains undefeated. Y'all so enjoy season one of a show.</v>

65
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.020
That's able to address everything from corporate greed to the me too movement

66
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.850
with everything from laser babies,

67
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.470
how was diabolical to finger blasting a Gill hole God

68
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.880
in a series that reveals the unsettling truth of our superhero obsessed culture.

69
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.120
We're not suspending disbelief. When we watch our hero soar,

70
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.240
we're suspending disbelief that they wouldn't burn us all to the ground.

71
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:19.463
<v 0>I know.</v>

72
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.940
<v 1>Save Martha story. New Zealand,</v>

73
00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.530
Jack Sparrow, Sylvie,

74
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.520
Louis C K let's go to the couch,

75
00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:36.240
have a nice warm pizza row and wait for this all to blow over the it.

76
00:04:36.241 --> 00:04:40.290
Cowed American psycho Twilight sparkle

77
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.510
adventures, and super babysitting OJ sprints in the AAT.

78
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.980
The 7 cents and mentees were seasoned to four.

79
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.160
<v 0>A few more. I don't think it's Morgan Freeman up there or anything,</v>

80
00:04:53.161 --> 00:04:54.360
but by ourselves.

81
00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.150
<v 1>Wait he's mother's milk. That's gotta be mistake, right? Shouldn't she be?</v>

82
00:05:00.151 --> 00:05:04.380
Mother's milk there. Fixed it for you the year 2020.

83
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.140
<v 0>He, he just, when he can't get any more horrible,</v>

84
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.430
get a little more horrible.

85
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.600
<v 1>An exposition news live whenever it's convenient.</v>

86
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.890
<v 0>Allowing superheroes international defense of more people where maybe I wouldn't</v>

87
00:05:19.891 --> 00:05:23.220
have to say that they're a train versus shockwave.

88
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.060
The race of the century Starlight shocking. The Christian community.

89
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.720
Social media is still buzzing about her controversial speech.

90
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.820
I believe that our encounter was consensual.

91
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.570
What I want to know who's that dude, this stuck is in her face. She should

92
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.030
all super cops are.

93
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.250
<v 1>You need someone to tease as the big villain for the second season of your</v>

94
00:05:47.251 --> 00:05:51.120
prestige TV show, you call John Carlo Esposito.

95
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.820
Want to watch more stuff like the boys click box to see us break down the best

superhero comedies of all time.

So you can decide what to Miley chuckle next I'm [inaudible]

98
00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.480
every breath I take,

99
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.490
every move I make every bone I break. Every step I take,

100
