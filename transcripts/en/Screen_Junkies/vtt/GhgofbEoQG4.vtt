done. Also rejoin no one else for very long to make room for cool new

00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:43.760
merchandise. I mean characters like Forkey,

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.810
Pixar's attempt to make suicidal depression fun for the whole family.

13
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.570
<v 2>You're just like me, trash.</v>

14
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.530
<v 0>Bunny and ducky and onscreen depiction of how key and Peele is end being chained</v>

<v 0>But all, no one wants to be her friend.</v>

19
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.240
And finally Kiana resists here to be Keanu Reeves because someone said,

20
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.980
Hey, we've got Kiana raise money.

21
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.430
So when the pod starts to drag let's Kentuckiana Reeves, Hey,

22
00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:17.480
I didn't know you could do that.

23
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.450
Can we just cash in on how much you love Kiana from other stuff too.

24
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.350
Studios may have stopped making dramas,

25
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.930
but then doesn't mean we all don't still need a good cry now.

26
00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:39.590
And then as you return to the franchise that started out as a buddy comedy with

27
00:01:39.591 --> 00:01:42.110
a dash of insight, but somehow along the way,

28
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.220
lean hard into existential dread in this animated romp where the major

29
00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:48.020
characters wonder if they have a soul.

30
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.600
<v 4>The voice inside of you, who do you think it is?</v>

31
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.230
<v 0>Make snap decisions that will determine their fate for the rest of their lives.</v>

32
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.310
Are you sure and confront the grim reality of permanent physical injuries that

33
00:01:58.311 --> 00:02:02.750
will render them garbage forever? Wait,

34
00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:05.030
so Bobi believes in a playground and she's made a porcelain,

35
00:02:05.031 --> 00:02:07.730
but the only thing that's broken in years is one arm.

36
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.340
I'm starting to think these movies aren't even based on a true story,

37
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.810
right along for another story about some toys where they're not even trying to

38
00:02:14.811 --> 00:02:16.220
hide their sentience anymore.

39
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.660
<v 4>Your backpacks of the antique store.</v>

40
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.710
<v 0>And who will turn against their masters. If it furthers their sofas,</v>

41
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.300
James tats totally go to jail because when one kid and her dumb fork are

42
00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:28.640
separated, what he's got to get to kindergarten,

43
00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:31.430
get to Forkey get back to the family, get away from the antique store.

44
00:02:31.431 --> 00:02:33.740
Get away from this other kid. Get back to the antique store,

45
00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:36.290
get the key to the cabinet. Get to the cabinet, get away from the cat.

46
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.260
Get to Forkey. Get back to Bonnie and get back to Gabby. Get to the carousel,

47
00:02:39.261 --> 00:02:41.900
get back to Barney. Wait, hold that thought. Get Gabby to a straight child.

48
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.640
Now get back to Barney. Hold that thought.

49
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.390
Get back to Bo and live happily ever after. Well,

50
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.070
there was no good reason to make another one of these,

51
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.070
but if the story moves fast enough, you might not even notice and turn it.

52
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.450
And they managed to make me cry again. Let gelatin die. Three toy stories ago,

53
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.820
super prepared and lose yourself in an that looks even more dazzling than the

54
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:03.910
others. Even though Randy Newman clearly phoned it in this time

55
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.300
in a field,

56
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.330
that's not interested in your dumb logical questions about how this world war.

57
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.400
<v 2>How am I a, a wife.</v>

58
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.760

59
00:03:20.761 --> 00:03:22.500
different children or stick to the stable,

60
00:03:22.501 --> 00:03:26.130
gentle caress of a single child with whom they share a deep and lifelong bond.

61
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.770
Okay. Why does it sound like I'm describing 50 shades of gray now,

62
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.250
way to make it weird combat Carl's getting played with

63
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.550
