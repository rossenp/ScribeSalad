<v 0>This summer, we're getting honest about summer blockbusters past and present.</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.250
This is honest trailers. Blockbuster summer.

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.080
This episode is sponsored by CBS all access,

4
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.060
not at all. Based on the classic scifi novel comes the film that made you say,

5
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.380
Ooh, rah. When it first came out, then,

6
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.070
oh, I get it. When you watched a few years later, Hey,

7
00:00:31.071 --> 00:00:36.020
attention Starship troopers dress up like

8
00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:40.130
master chiefs, broke boy, cousin for this bugs versus apes war epic.

9
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.810
That satirizes what life is like in a militarized society where it costs an arm

10
00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:47.300
and a leg to vote. Every channel is Fox.

11
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.840
<v 1>News justice. The big.</v>

12
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.550
<v 0>Villain is every fascist secret fear of a Jina that can think for</v>

13
00:00:55.551 --> 00:00:56.384
itself,

14
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.800
not there might be a brain tug on P and full racial and gender equality exist

15
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.470
because we're all too horned up on genocide.

16
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.490
<v 1>Can I say kill them all. Edit.</v>

17
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.090
<v 0>Anyone. Think the guy behind Robocop made a sincere film about sexy troops.</v>

18
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.400
There's a child soldier in the first 45 seconds.

19
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.900
Meet a cast of teenagers who put the Hotsy and Nazi as they follow

20
00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:22.640
their off to a space war.

21
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.690
<v 2>Joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her there's.</v>

22
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.630
<v 0>Rico, the bold leader who will literally do anything,</v>

23
00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:31.250
his favorite teacher tells them to.

24
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.290
<v 2>And we mean anything.</v>

25
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.770
<v 3>I never pass up a thing. I could 20 minutes. Yes, sir.</v>

26
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.590
<v 0>Carmen, who's just the worst.</v>

27
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.260
<v 4>I'm gonna go career. I don't think that's gonna leave a lot of room for you,</v>

28
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.540
Johnny. You know what I want? Like, do you want.

29
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.990
<v 0>Neil Patrick Harris back when he was still trying to break out of the nerd</v>

30
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.070
roles, but it's still a math geek with a pet ferret Goldbug mom,

31
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.910
plus a bunch of supporting characters who desperately want to have sex with all

32
00:01:58.911 --> 00:01:59.744
of them.

33
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.590
Evil space books are on the attack because they hate our freedom or because we

34
00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:08.840
started colonizing their planets tomato tomato.

35
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.530
Now they're sending hoards of fierce warriors who can withstand a hail of

36
00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:13.364
gunfire.

37
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.280
<v 5>[Inaudible].</v>

38
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.110
<v 0>Or like have a clip with the pod, demands it</v>

39
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.280
in beautifully crafted battle scenes that still fool the eye. 20 years later,

40
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.240
blending the meticulous use of CGI with the repulsive neon goo.

41
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.010
They used to mix monster energy.

42
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.580
Hey, motor movies use real goo. He can't fake good goo his stomach.

43
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.860
Enjoy some of the greatest line readings in film history. That's good.

44
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.310
Good deliver with such sincerity.

45
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.610
You wonder if the cast is even in on the joke.

46
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.650
<v 5>Bunks, whacked, just as.</v>

47
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.550
<v 0>Everyone commits so hard, you'll be ready to enlist in the space force.</v>

48
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.080
I mean mobile infantry,

49
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.170
because even though they're making fun of how dumb this culture is,

50
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.170
who wouldn't want to play some taser tag than cool over the nice group co-ed

51
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:17.260
shower. Just look at all these soapy private sub dot privates.

52
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.350
So enjoy a work of subversive genius.

53
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.750
That was definitely misunderstood when it came out,

54
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.830
but now enough time has passed for the world to realize it's not a dumb war

55
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:31.270
movie. It's just a movie about using war to take advantage of dumb people.

56
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.570
<v 6>What did you say? Private Lieutenant.</v>

57
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.300
<v 0>Rico? Sorry. I, uh, I was just trying to make a joke.</v>

58
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.960
<v 6>Just trying to make a joke, sir, sir. Just trying to make a joke, sir.</v>

59
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.040
Do you see me laughing, sir? No, sir. I have one rule in this unit.

60
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.080
Nobody quits. Every joke hits. Is that Claire, sir? Yes, sir. Handover your mic.

61
00:03:49.081 --> 00:03:51.450
Private. Oh, take it from here. Yes, sir.

62
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.770
Starry battle star Galactica.

63
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.420
She wants the dues.

64
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.670
Where in the world is Carmen Buenos Aires. I'm with UC.

65
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.140
Get out of my head. Do gait shot for teacher. Whoa,

66
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.820
it's hang from breaking bad.

67
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.740
I love that show StarCraft and my desire to know

68
00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:17.940
more intense of eyes saving private Rico.

69
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.940
Nicely done. Sir.

70
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.770
