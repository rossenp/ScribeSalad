<v 0>Ruined by an all new streaming series.</v>

5
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.140
<v 1>Made by the monsters at Disney. I'm confused. Do they hate us or not?</v>

6
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.440
This is the way the Mandalorian

7
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.710
anagen was supposed to bring balance.

8
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.300
Luke should have saved the day and Ray just ended up squatting at the form of

9
00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:39.200
her mentors, uncle that he hated. And couldn't wait to run away from, sorry.

10
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.610
Sorry, not today. Episode nine. Now as our heroes fall,

11
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.160
one food truck enthusiast will rise.

12
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.260
Revitalize the franchise in his VR garage and keep the empire in business.

13
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.410
With eight episodes of Western riffs,

14
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.590
they got the fan base all up in their feelings over a Muppet baby,

15
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.980
Kathleen Kennedy, more like Craply and kina all

16
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.130
suit up with within Jorin AKA Mondo, which starts to sound like a slur.

17
00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:07.964
The more you hear it.

18
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.150
<v 0>Hey man, don't hand over the child. Amanda, get that plastic.</v>

19
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.120
<v 1>Uh, guys, that's their word? Are you sure we can use it? Uh, truth.</v>

20
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.090
The motto after the prequels literally ruined his childhood.

21
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.190
Follow this wandering bounty Hunter on a tale of redemption in between a whole

22
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:26.600
bunch of actual wandery.

23
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.040
As he jets from exotic locales to less exotic locales to a

24
00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:46.880
quick detour, to most nostalgia, to pick up a delivery of Easter eggs,

25
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:47.810
womp rack.

26
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.213
<v 0>Tusken Raiders.</v>

27
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.270
<v 1>But screw it. How fun is it to dig around in the star Wars universe?</v>

28
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:55.910
Without some sad kid in there, daddy has used killing the vibe, man.

29
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.080
Everything will change when this loan not a gun gun gunman,

30
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.280
maybe he's a Gungan meets the most adorable MacGuffin of all time,

31
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.480
the child, okay. You know what? We're not doing that. He's the baby Yoda.

32
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.710
We're calling him baby Yoda.

33
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.850
He's a magic puppet who can kill you with [inaudible].

34
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:17.630
<v 0>And if that doesn't.</v>

35
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.400
<v 1>Work, he can always just kill you.</v>

36
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.990
But one thing is for certain he's not nearly as precocious when they reveal

37
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.920
he's actually a middle age, man. They said 50 years old.

38
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.260
I'm only you baby Yoda. You can talk.

39
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.820
You're just some creepy boomer with a diaper fetish. Aren't you Emily,

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.500
but let my kid play with you. Saddle up for brand new star Wars adventures.

41
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.190
The likes of which you've never seen before, but don't freak out.

42
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.720
Look the moodier stuff tattooing let's say stormtroopers, good breathe.

43
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.100
Good.

44
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.780
In this tale of one man's destiny to clear and extremely low bar

45
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.310
be the best single dad in star Wars.

46
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.370
But this father son duo won't travel alone.

47
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.330
There's Quiel who finally gave a modern update to talk to the hand.

48
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.600
<v 0>I have spoken. I have spoken.</v>

49
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.130
<v 1>Welcome to buy as few gaze acting coach. You take this home.</v>

50
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.850
<v 0>Throw it in a pot, add some broth, a potato [inaudible].</v>

51
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.380
<v 1>And Kara dune the ex rebel with less range than the guy in the helmet.</v>

52
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.790
So we're going to build a trap.

53
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.590
We're going to need to take real deep right here so that when it steps in,

54
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.300
it drops together. They'll encounter scum, villainy,

55
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.290
and the best alternate dimension cast of Saturday night live with

56
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.300
Horatio's.

57
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.770
Sam's Brian [inaudible] Amy Sedaris,

58
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.983
bill bird,

59
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.460

60
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.180
Andrew host Tyco YTD.

61
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.060
<v 0>If suffered damage to your central processing unit,</v>

62
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.440
you mean my brain. That was a joke.

63
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.850
<v 1>So strap in for a show that every level of star Wars fan can enjoy.</v>

64
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.210
Whether you're a new who just wanted to know why baby Yoda was on your kid's

65
00:04:12.211 --> 00:04:15.480
Christmas list, but stuck around. Cause it reminded you of the searchers,

66
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.620
a casual fan who spent eight episodes wondering why Luke Skywalker wasn't in the

67
00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:24.210
Boba Fett show or a hardcore nerd who needed validation for keeping your toy

68
00:04:24.211 --> 00:04:26.730
collection, mint and box all these years. Wait,

69
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.570
is that the Imperial troop transport of my youth.

70
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.310
It's it's beautiful that owes its success to telling a simple lean

71
00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:38.910
story about an all new family in the star Wars universe.

72
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.230
And because it was a hit,

73
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.050
they're probably about to weigh it down with a bunch of lower crossovers.

74
00:04:43.051 --> 00:04:45.690
And spin-offs ah, this is the way

75
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.320
starring dark helmet. Ah, I'm 50 baby.

76
00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:55.020
You've got a root lease do going MMA.

77
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.790
[inaudible] Warner Herzog as himself.

78
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.110
I see nothing but deaths and chaos.

79
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.410
I would like to see the baby. Yes. Aiden, I'm sorry, sir.

80
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.810
You sounded like someone else. The babysitter clubs,

81
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.410
you don't pity then shut your mouth because I have spoken

82
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.320
the outer sky rib. How do you like the Maddox? Huh? Bobo feet.

83
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.380
Let's make the baby and do the magic hands. Come on baby.

84
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.820
Do the magic hand thing.

85
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.990
That's not how the magic hand thing works nerds of the round table.

86
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.890
And when my friends ask what fastball song we're listening to,

87
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.100
this is the way this is the way this is the way, right?

88
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.880
<v 0>That's just the way this is the way this is the way this is the way.</v>

89
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.610
<v 1>The outer rim job.</v>

90
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.700
And once again, the galaxy has a mostly mechanic,

91
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.650
bounty hunting and Cantina centric economy.

92
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.520
No one's ever a real estate agent in these things, marketing.

93
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.910
Some of the star Wars universe remains dentist free don't they have teeth.

94
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.560

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.060
I am a Mandalorian. Weapons are part of my religion.

100
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.830
This is the way or I have spoken I'm curvy.

101

And I like it.
