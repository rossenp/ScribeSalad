00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.320
<v 1>From Warner bros and their former bro. Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.070
<v 0>It's sort of not how you treat filmmakers and stars.</v>

3
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.570
<v 1>Becomes a film about technology that reverses the flow of time that no one</v>

4
00:00:20.571 --> 00:00:23.570
wishes was real. So we could have released the movie four months earlier,

5
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.520
Tenant experience. What happens when a filmmaker goes so far up his own,

6
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.380
but that everything gets inverted.

7
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.160
<v 2>Two antagonists, one in verdict and machine.</v>

8
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.050
She shot when an inverted Brown you are in Virginia blue team,

9
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.590
inverted thought you were inverted kind of stabilize the invest radiation by

10
00:00:45.591 --> 00:00:46.424
inverting.

11
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.850
<v 1>That would take twice the number of memento plot dogs to properly explain.</v>

12
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.250
<v 2>That's basically the end of the amendment, but.</v>

13
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.340
<v 1>Basically some people and objects are moving backwards in time.</v>

14
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.830
The people moving forwards in time can interact with them.

15
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.820
And everyone's buddy to control a big mess, stab that blessed the past.

16
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.820
Did you still get lost? Don't worry. So to the cat.

17
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.990
<v 0>Sometimes the logic teacher to catch up to what I believe he would feel in the</v>

18
00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:12.020
moment, even if I can't all the way, explain what it was. You know,

19
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.410
it's not even a question of getting everything or even anything.

20
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.100
I think my last question is saying, am I alive or dead?

21
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.990
<v 1>Critics have taken no into task for as overbanked plots under developed</v>

22
00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:27.140
characters and all white heroes. Well,

23
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.160
he's addressed one of those things. Denzel Washington,

24
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.170
sun stars, as the protagonist, a mysterious secret, um,

25
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.980
protagonist to, uh, look, he's a protagonist. Okay.

26
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.023
That's all you're going to get.

27
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.840
I'm the protagonist he's joined by Neil of fellow time cop.

28
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.850
Who's the bill two protagonists, Ted.

29
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.570
<v 0>Let we get up to some stuff. You're going to love it, dude.</v>

30
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.100
<v 2>You guys are going to go back in time. Yeah. You are going to have the books.</v>

31
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.760
<v 0>Excellent adventure, or you never did tell me who recruited you, Neil.</v>

32
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.090
<v 2>You did, or you guys were, you did.</v>

33
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.610
<v 1>No way backs who continues the grand Nolan tradition of largely</v>

34
00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:11.540
mute children. You only see the hero of cat a woman's so tall.

35
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.400
She could drive a car from the backseat.

36
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.070
Michael Kane as himself must have my car. Sure. Why not? And sate of vodka,

37
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.061
swilling arms dealer.

38
00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:23.990
Who's an Adidas tracksuit away from checking off every evil Russian stereotype.

39
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.040
<v 2>Tell me about the radiation on the receptor.</v>

40
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.330
Taking plutonium from the rebel of my city as a teenager.

41
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.700
<v 1>Well, he's not the most over the top Russian I've seen.</v>

42
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.370
So I guess he earned his paycheck, paid that men,

43
00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:41.840
his money pushed through this extremely dense and intricate way of telling an

44
00:02:41.841 --> 00:02:45.950
unsatisfying hollow spy story that feels like the movie adaptation of a

45
00:02:45.951 --> 00:02:48.590
crossword puzzle because it kind of is.

46
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.490
And when you strip away the mind-bending Saifai concept and parse through the

47
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.100
hard to hear dialogue [inaudible].

48
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.190
<v 0>Private place and managed to stay.</v>

49
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.630
<v 1>Awake through all of the meetings.</v>

50
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.840
It's just a backdrop for rich people doing time crimes to each other,

51
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.740
like a Rube Goldberg machine that ends with you getting kicked in the nuts is

52
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.890
your.

53
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.510
<v 3>Head, Hey yet? Yes.</v>

54
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.310
<v 1>Thrill as Nolan.</v>

55
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:16.180
Rediscovers the backwards action thinking from that spike Jones video and the

56
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:19.780
backwards talking thing from that Missy Elliot song, as he in the cast,

57
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.460
pull off the incredible fee of filming huge sequences in reverse that in theory

58
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.440
sound like they reinvent the genre,

59
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.810
but just looks like they chose the rehearsal takes of them,

60
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:30.130
practicing the choreography.

61
00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.200
And what's less of a mind and more of just a frustrating chore to make sense of

62
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.840
like someone inverted your controls on GTA.

63
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.840
So suit up once again, just not in that off the rack,

64
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.840
poor person kind of way Brooks previs for what may not be no one

65
00:03:56.841 --> 00:03:57.720
at his best,

66
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.680
but it definitely is no one at his most that exaggerates everything you either

67
00:04:01.681 --> 00:04:03.420
love or hate about his films.

68
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.720
And if you're a no-win worshiper who wants to rewatch something three times

69
00:04:06.721 --> 00:04:09.930
before, it makes sense more power to you. I just hope, you know,

70
00:04:09.931 --> 00:04:13.170
you also have to pretend to love Tokyo drift to what do you like about fast and

71
00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:17.820
furious? I'm sort of original recipe kind of original. Um,

72
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.520
but I I've got a very soft spot for Tokyo drift. Actually.

73
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.200
Of course he loves Tokyo drift.

74
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.610
It's the one that completely messed up the timeline story.

75
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.270
Let's just put the protagonist here for now and come up with something better

76
00:04:30.271 --> 00:04:32.880
later. Tinker time, Lord soldier, spy.

77
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.680
What if let Amir Putin looked like Harvey Weinstein and as a picky picky, wild,

78
00:04:37.681 --> 00:04:39.870
wild, fat burly eyes,

79
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.950
moody Dench and how no one writes a character.

80
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.130
<v 3>No small talk, nothing that might reveal who we are or what we do.</v>

81
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.290
<v 1>A man, a plan, a canal, Panama, Whoa.</v>

82
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.460
You know, if I were inverted, I just pooped in front of my enemies.

83
00:04:56.461 --> 00:04:58.230
So they have to watch it materialize on the floor.

84
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.690
Then shoots up into my butt cheeks. That'd be awesome.

85
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.930
I am an industrial welder tented movie was inspired by master

86
00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:08.190
Yoda dialogues.

87
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.050
That's my bike punk blue to UNE balloons,

88
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.560
blue to few goons to the new moon.

89
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.250
Have yourself a Merry Christmas.
