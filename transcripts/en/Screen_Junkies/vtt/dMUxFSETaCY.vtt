00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.180
<v 1>From the world that brought you 1918, 1347,</v>

2
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.080
and Woodstock 99 comes a year.

3
00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:22.700
We can wait to close the book on, even though 2021 is when the real pain begins.

4
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.520
Um, the way, Oops,

5
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.300
spoiler alert on his 20, 20,

6
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.740
after two months of blissful, hedgehog filled ignorance.

7
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.870
I've never felt so alive.

8
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.970
A hot new virus drop that affects everyone equally causing the world to set

9
00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:47.690
aside their differences, work together and cooperate to fight back.

10
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.930
I'm just getting, you know, we all stay doing our same old dumb.

11
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.600
The only thing that actually brought us together was tiger King.

12
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.580
Can you believe that came out only 10 years ago,

13
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.600
tune in to this live action adaptation of the book of revelation,

14
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.200
complete with fires, famine, plagues,

15
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.390
and other signs of the end times featuring lockdowns that have lasted so long.

16
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.900
We've run out of post-apocalyptic movies to compare it to is your sucks.

17
00:01:11.901 --> 00:01:13.700
You guys, this year.

18
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.660
<v 2>Sucks.</v>

19
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.290
That's all the ammo you've got for this love crafty and elf we're in Patton.

20
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.540
Oswald. Yeah. Yeah. Long time listener.

21
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:24.500
First time caller making sure you stay brutally honest about 2020.

22
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.360
Remember Avengers end game. I think about it once a day. Of course you do. Okay.

23
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.360
Think about the, on your left moment, right? Cap is down.

24
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.760
The odds are against him suddenly hope,

25
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.990
but then instead of what condoms and wizards and zero body fat hunk coming out

26
00:01:38.991 --> 00:01:43.610
of those portals, there's just human. Just a never ending firehose,

27
00:01:43.611 --> 00:01:48.320
torrent of diarrhea directly into caps, mouth eyeballs, that 2020.

28
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.040
<v 1>Wow. That is honest. Yeah. More like that. Keep going,</v>

29
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.250
cancel your plans and cover your webcam.

30
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.790
Cause you're not going anywhere all year. It's been 84 years.

31
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.750
And now with HBO treating theaters like Lenny at the end of mice and men,

32
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.850
the new home of entertainment is your home.

33
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.910
And the new home of work is your home.

34
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.150
And the new home of school is your home.

35
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.170
And the new home of your home is out on the street because how the am I supposed

36
00:02:24.171 --> 00:02:25.700
to pay rent? When everything is shut down.

37
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.090
<v 2>Would it help with my friends? And I saying, imagine for you again. No, look,</v>

38
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.990
how about Fleetwood Mac's dreams. Maybe.

39
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.270
<v 0>Now, here you go again. You say you won't,</v>

40
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.070
you free hit 'em.

41
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.990
<v 1>Ah, that's better,</v>

42
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.760
but there is light in the darkness and that light is the glow of the screen.

43
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:47.960
You're on right now.

44
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.520
As we string so much ISP suddenly remembered they wipe their with net neutrality

45
00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:55.820
two years ago. But until the party's over, we'll keep binging.

46
00:02:55.821 --> 00:03:00.010
The shows that help us escape to the before times, six feet apart, come on.

47
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.310
The VOD releases that have us dropping big bucks,

48
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:06.490
just for the thrill of watching something new, eh, maybe not,

49
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.240
and enjoying another cozy night in with the loved ones, bitterly,

50
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:11.800
arguing over what the street.

51
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.550
<v 2>You've been through the crown twice already.</v>

52
00:03:14.551 --> 00:03:18.180
Can we please watch the wire before a vaccine comes out at FAU.

53
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.370
<v 1>Program lacks all matter of refinement.</v>

54
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.500
<v 2>Stop pretending your a Royal. You don't have the breeding Frazier fine.</v>

55
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.540
<v 1>So let's Pat ourselves on the back for surviving 2020. Even though every year,</v>

56
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.790
the major war depression has been way worse.

57
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.560
We just didn't have Twitter to complain about it.

58
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.930
And let's embrace distractions like social media, movies, TV and games.

59
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.050
Not just because they're helping us to get through these difficult times,

60
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.520
but because staying home all day,

61
00:03:44.521 --> 00:03:47.670
eating snacks on a hot couch is literally saving lives right now.

62
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.510
<v 2>Okay. You hear that mom now who needs to go outside and play that? Yeah,</v>

63
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.910
go make me some meatloaf. What'd you? My game's about to start.

64
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.100
<v 1>Starring. No one cared who I was till I put on the bag.</v>

65
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.630
<v 2>Ask America your screwed America. You're screwed,</v>

66
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.190
but we feel your pain. Number one, film at the box office, bad boys for life.

67
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.120
Finally.

68
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.470
<v 1>Seeing them aliens.</v>

69
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.290
<v 2>Greatest of all time for 500.</v>

70
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.560
<v 1>Just when I think you couldn't possibly be any dumber,</v>

71
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.950
you go and do something like this and.

72
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.750
<v 0>Totally redeem yourself.</v>

73
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.330
<v 2>Millions of people speaking up to make their voices heard.</v>

74
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.100
<v 1>Harassing the Snyder, cut into existence. Stay in alive.</v>

75
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.560
Remember in 2016 with like five celebrities died and everyone said things

76
00:04:37.561 --> 00:04:38.850
couldn't possibly get any worse.

77
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.540
<v 2>Have you people ever seen a movie? What did you think was going to happen?</v>

78
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.030
I really don't think things could get any worse.

79
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.590
<v 0>Well, at least it can't get any worse, but at least to can't get any worse.</v>

80
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.450
<v 2>Or look on the positive side of these things.</v>

81
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.930
<v 0>Excuse me. Were you going to say worse? No. No. You sure,</v>

82
00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.730
absolutely not revise that.

83
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.390
<v 1>It's got electrical AIDS. It's what plants grave.</v>

84
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.680
Sometimes I doubt your commitment to sparkle motion.

85
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.910
How does it make you feel? When I say the word moist,

86
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.070
it ain't over until Epic voice guy has read the final comment.

87
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.530
<v 0>2020.</v>
