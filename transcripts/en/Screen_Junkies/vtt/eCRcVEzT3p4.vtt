00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.970
This episode is sponsored by Google play with the help of seven deadly sins,

grand cross

5
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.100
In the early two thousands adults with change the animation game,

6
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.090
but only one classic animated series made fans sit up,

7
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.980
rubbed their eyes and say, Oh, I missed off watching hunger boards again. Ah,

8
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.780
fine. I'll watch whatever this is.

9
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.190
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

10
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.500
<v 0>Oh crap. I think I like anime now.</v>

11
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.580
Cowboy bebop experience a Nawar filtered future

12
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.870
where humanity has spread into the solar system and covered it in hot,

13
00:00:53.871 --> 00:00:55.520
steamy jazz,

14
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.270
where there's so much crime bounty hunting is part of the gig economy that

15
00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:04.700
attracts only the heaviest Chainsmokers.

16
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.520
It looks like a plain old moon rock to me now.

17
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.370
<v 1>Hey, how much is it worth? If we try to sell it.</v>

18
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.640
<v 0>There are basically Uber drivers with a few more guns,</v>

19
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.930
strap it with a crew of the bebop,

20
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.790
a group of misfits each with their own mysterious and complex backstories that

21
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:30.350
you're not going to get much of. Okay.

22
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.350
<v 1>I remember everything, really everything except my own life.</v>

23
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.490
<v 0>There. Spike Spiegel of me lean fighting machine.</v>

24
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.720

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.760
<v 0>Also has a literal, mainly</v>

26
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.920
Fave Valentine. Who's perpetually broke. If I get rid of my body,

27
00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:54.290
I won't need money. Perpetually levy.

28
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.273
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

29
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.583
I have to go.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.820
<v 0>And perpetually wedgied ed, a genius hacker who talks like Elmo.</v>

31
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.180
<v 1>Edward is Edward. Ed has never seen this before.</v>

32
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.400
Ed knows where it is today.

33
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.450
It goes looking for this Ruki mysterious alien.

34
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.650
<v 0>I am a super intelligent corgi who mostly just acts like a moderately</v>

35
00:02:24.651 --> 00:02:27.560
intelligent corgi and jet that guy,

36
00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:29.990
your mom dated for a while after the divorce.

37
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.260
<v 1>Complaining and be thankful there's something to eat.</v>

38
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.100
<v 0>Then don't come back. There won't be a place for you. Good Britons.</v>

39
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.680
You're not my real dad together.

40
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.600
They'll team up to take on the vicious crime boss known as vicious

41
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.350
occasionally, but mostly they'll be focused on food.

42
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.670
<v 1>It is hungry. We haven't had anything to eat in two days.</v>

43
00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:56.750
I haven't eaten Brimore halibut in a long while we just came here because

44
00:02:56.751 --> 00:03:00.070
there's good food. I am starving.

45
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.930
<v 0>That's all there is making a quick long.</v>

46
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.910
<v 1>2.5 Million 6,300,</v>

47
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.900
5,350.

48
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.270
<v 0>Or just kind of hanging out.</v>

49
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.410
But no matter the adventure,

50
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.800
you can bet that the thing that gets mentioned at the beginning of the episode

51
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.780
will be super important. I want to be a tough.

52
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.970
<v 1>Guy. Like you, you know, come on, I can do.</v>

53
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.070
<v 0>It. And super depressing.</v>

54
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.440
<v 1>Master. You see it? I was fluid like water. Yeah.</v>

55
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.490
Don't try to talk anymore. Hang on. Now don't die. Don't die.

56
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.830
<v 0>Wow. That is that enough to conjure up some introspective Sachs music.</v>

57
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.380
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

58
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.220
<v 0>Anyone else hear that?</v>

59
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.740
Or is that just when my brain sounds like when I watched the show?

60
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.220
So revisit the all-time classic anime,

61
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.420
that was probably your gateway drug into the hard stuff that clearly, uh,

62
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.640
inspired other shows about scifi Outlaws turned family in a junk between your

63
00:04:11.641 --> 00:04:12.540
guitar strings,

64
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.350
that mixed Asian and Western aesthetics that was followed by a movie with mixed

65
00:04:16.351 --> 00:04:20.730
reviews. And while they both might have some all-time great things. Arms only.

66
00:04:20.731 --> 00:04:22.680
Cowboys is a literal Bob

67
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.980

71
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:48.683
lady.

72
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.000
It's better. If you leave for today, there are other bounty heads to catch.

73
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.900
You don't need this one. If you see spike again,

74
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.210
tell him that I'll keep waiting.

75
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.050
