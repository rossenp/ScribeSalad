00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:11.570
alive. The dark fantasy open-world RPG

3
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.040
From the love child of Tim burden and Peewee Herman. When we made evil dead, I.

4
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.160
<v 0>Wanting to make, do something that.</v>

5
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.160
<v 1>Who's produced so much cool stuff throughout his career,</v>

6
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.450
but a whole generation only knows him for directing the Spiderman means

7
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.880
pizza time comes the mind blowing trilogy that was making you laugh and scream

8
00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:45.230
at the same time. Long before he cast over Grace's venom. I like being bad.

9
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.620
<v 0>It makes me happy.</v>

10
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.800
<v 1>The evil dead franchise</v>

11
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.380
scrap in for three excellent flicks that barely hang together as an actual

12
00:00:57.381 --> 00:00:58.214
trilogy,

13
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.020
evil dead one where some dumb teens drive all the way from Michigan to the

14
00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:06.230
worst little Airbnb in Tennessee, evil,

15
00:01:06.231 --> 00:01:08.030
dead to a half remake,

16
00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:11.780
half parody of the first one with a ratio of horror to comedy swapped

17
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.240
and evil dead three, which is called army of darkness,

18
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.190
but a direct sequel to evil dead two,

19
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.040
and is really more like a medieval times three Stooges movie.

20
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.150
They're all great in their own ways though. Consistencies for nerds,

21
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.960
Bruce Campbell stars. As this handsome piece of Ash,

22
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.130
he's got a chin like a clenched fist and a literally handy chainsaw.

23
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.630
Our hero will begin the trilogy as one of the more dumb and cowardly leading men

24
00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:45.464
in film history.

25
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.750
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

26
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.460
<v 1>Unable to overpower even the nearest shelving unit until he goes through so much</v>

27
00:01:55.461 --> 00:01:57.650
head trauma over the course of two films

28
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.820
That he turns into Duke NewCo. Come get some, give me some sugar,

29
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.690
baby Harold to King hail to the King. Baby

30
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.290
evil will rise when Ash stumbles across an ancient godkids sketchbook and

31
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.210
accidentally plays a curse podcast to summon the dead eyes, their parts, zombie.

32
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.810
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

33
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:30.920
<v 1>Part vampire</v>

34
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.060
and all SAS.

35
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.610
<v 0>I'm bad at.</v>

36
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.530
<v 1>You're good.</v>

37
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.210
As these demons resort to the one trick in their evil book possess one of your

38
00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:54.410
loved ones, then briefly pretend to be back to normal.

39
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.410
<v 0>Jane. And let me out shell.</v>

40
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.800
<v 1>How old is he keep falling for this.</v>

41
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.440
<v 2>Alloys and compositions and things with molecular structures in the</v>

42
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.930
Oh right. Moron.

43
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.210
<v 1>Thrill at films that are as light on substance as they are heavy with style as</v>

44
00:03:21.211 --> 00:03:25.470
Sam Raimi turns on no clip mode for his camera, running it through the woods.

45
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.320
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

46
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.580
<v 1>Like a lot, smashing it through windows.</v>

47
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.390
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

48
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.220
<v 1>Getting extremely close up</v>

49
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.340
and doing basically whatever he thought it looks fun and cool at the time from

50
00:03:47.341 --> 00:03:49.310
the awesome gearing up montages,

51
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.360
Groovy to the constant decapitations.

52
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.550
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

53
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.770
<v 1>To having a tree sexually assaulted a woman.</v>

54
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.873
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

55
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.980
<v 1>Uh, moving on. So enjoy these classic drive-in movies.</v>

56
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.150
Pass down through the generations of cool older siblings and weird uncles that

57
00:04:27.151 --> 00:04:31.170
proves you didn't need huge budgets and movie stars to make an awesome film.

58
00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.010
In fact,

59
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.830
you didn't even really have to know how to make a film to make an awesome film

60
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.220
focus. Just your old car, your high school buddy,

61
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.100
and another red dyed corn syrup to flood the Eastern seaboard.

62
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.180
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

63
00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.910
<v 1>Man, I cannot wait to see him do this to Benedict Cumberbatch,</v>

64
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.770
stupid clean faced handsome man story Ash,

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.520
kilo deuce Campbell burn. After reading,

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.830
I am Groot the King Lord mullet of Bogut

67
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.080
blend off loose sous.

68
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.010
<v 2>Halloween, Halloween, Halloween, but bill.</v>

69
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.070
<v 1>These are historical Babs and.</v>

70
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.370
<v 2>I'm talking to the man in the mirror.</v>

71
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.303
My face.

72
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.070
<v 1>The dead chainsaw massacre.</v>

73
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.250
The scariest part of these films is when Bruce Campbell comes close to getting

74
00:05:38.251 --> 00:05:39.084
canceled.

75
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.610
<v 0>Definitely careful.</v>

79
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.240
<v 2>Oh no, not the bees, not the bees. Oh, they're in my eyes.</v>

80
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.010
Oh,
