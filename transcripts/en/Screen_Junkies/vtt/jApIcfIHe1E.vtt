00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.050
<v 1>If you love historical mysteries, but wish they weren't.</v>

2
00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:16.790
So European switch the settings to easy mode for a scavenger hunt that anyone

3
00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:17.630
could figure out.

4
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.550
Even kids and Americans national treasurer.

5
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.960
When the declaration of independence is in danger, someone's.

6
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.090
<v 0>Going to steal the declaration of independence. One.</v>

7
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.450
<v 1>Group will steal the declaration of independence.</v>

8
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.970
<v 0>There's still a declaration so that.</v>

9
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.600
<v 1>No one else can steal the declaration of independence.</v>

10
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.110
<v 0>I'm not going to let you steal the declaration of independence.</v>

11
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.180
<v 1>And use it to re steal a bunch of treasure that America already stole equal or</v>

12
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.610
Mizuno that's American for funders keepers, meet Benjamin Franklin Gates,

13
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.970
the lease settle name for the most subtle Nick cage character.

14
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.540
Who's basically Ross Geller. If you were a professional America knower,

15
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.770
but who solves puzzles like he's the world's greatest detective Adam West

16
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.633
Batman.

17
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.490
<v 0>The legend and the key. There is something,</v>

18
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.970
a map maps have legends maps have keys,

19
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.870
make a dishonest shortcake library.

20
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.740
Clearly a corrupted version of a word library. The map said here at the wall,

21
00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:20.930
spelled a two is wall street falls,

22
00:01:20.931 --> 00:01:24.800
the path of an actual wall that the original Dutch sellers built as a defense to

23
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.100
Maingate was located. A street called to here also two weeks.

24
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.080
When is the time of the clock?

25
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:34.100
Like the whistle of the train when it's tilted too.

26
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.730
<v 1>Hang on. This movie is about the Freemasons.</v>

27
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.590
And this movie was produced by Jerry Brooke, hover,

28
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.150
who also made the rock where Sean Connery plays. John Mason, Connery con.

29
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.370
<v 2>Ornery, ornery, Khan, logging, old people, and one old person,</v>

30
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.720
Lord general, humble, who is played by ed Harris, con Harris con air,

31
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.590
which is also produced by Bruckheimer and stored Nicholas cage.

32
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.540
And the villain was Cyrus. The Firuz coronavirus, a con in the air,

33
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.860
wake up sheeple.

34
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.130
<v 1>But to pull off the highest of the bicentennial,</v>

35
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.460
this walking pub trivia night is going to need a kick crew.

36
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.290
So he's bringing along this one nerd. He knows everything.

37
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.600
<v 0>I'm tracking it through the GPS and Charlotte's phone,</v>

38
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.780
daylight savings wasn't established until world war II.

39
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.000
I could just shoot warning that we end here.

40
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.010
It could be that the hydrothermal properties of this region produced hurricane

41
00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:28.844
force ice.

42
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.880
<v 1>Until it's funny for him to not know anything.</v>

43
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.300
<v 0>Okay? What's not endorsed cipher. Do you know what the preservation room is for?</v>

44
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.460
Delicious jams and jellies? What do we do with them? We look through it.

45
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.340
<v 1>Together. They'll rope. One more person into their skiing. A Woolworth woman.</v>

46
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.080
Very cute man, who spends the entire movie being told to shut up.

47
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.550
And can you please stop shouting?

48
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.880
<v 0>You're still shy. Quiet please. Now, shush.</v>

49
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.990
She really can't shut her mouth gantry. Shut up please.

50
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.360
She's the one calling all the shots. Now she won't shut up.

51
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.060
<v 1>Until she rewards our heroes. Patriotic tune writing with a mat to her vagina.</v>

52
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.360
Where does it lead to you'll figure it out. Oh,

53
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.160
the real national treasure was inside her all along strap in for an

54
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.530
action packed mandatory high school field trip.

55
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.320
As the movie gives our nation substitute teachers enough,

56
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.290
Ben Franklin facts to excuse at least five smoke breaks.

57
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.980
<v 0>Do you actually know who the first person to suggest daylight savings one.</v>

58
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.170
<v 1>And fills in the rest of the run time with generic shootouts and explosions</v>

59
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.850
until the day is Sayed.

60
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.570
Thanks to skills you learn from your real history teacher video game.

61
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.573
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

62
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.490
<v 1>So enjoy a movie that blows loads for America Bruckheimer style.</v>

63
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.600
That'll take you back to simpler times where our only adversaries were blonde

64
00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:55.230
Euro.

65
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.710
Hong's trying to steal our coin collections and the secret cabal who robbed

66
00:03:58.711 --> 00:04:01.380
other cultures, ran the country in secret and hold.

67
00:04:01.381 --> 00:04:04.440
The highest positions in law enforcement was like a super cool,

68
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.560
good thing that any kid would be happy to join to you.

69
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.450
<v 0>So swear. So sweet.</v>

70
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.830
<v 1>Oh, I want to be in the deep state story.</v>

71
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.180
Indie Alex Jones, the DaVinci doctor,

72
00:04:18.181 --> 00:04:23.130
girlfriend surprised mother one does not simply walk into the national archives.

73
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.600
The Wolf historians being reckless with priceless artifacts.

74
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.273
Don't don't break it.

75
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.980
<v 0>I found the Charlotte. You mean she was a ship here and she was.</v>

76
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.963
<v 3>Beautiful.</v>

77
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.720
<v 1>Sassy black glary. We take visa. Doesn't look like,</v>

78
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.983
do you want some?

79
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.540
And the only time Nick cage gets to Nick cage.

80
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.960
<v 0>That's it. Okay. It's over.</v>

81
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.540
<v 1>Red, white and blues glues.</v>

82
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.350
<v 3>Do a bunch of guys with them.</v>

83
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.260
<v 0>And tools build all this. So when they built the pyramids,</v>

84
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.740
the great wall of China slaves.

85
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.100
<v 1>I'm the holiday Alma Domo.</v>

86
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.520
Here's my body fit and pure.

87
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.080
Now you're black and souls. Oh, cure coffee,

or need or kill you. I with Gugu Gaga.

89
