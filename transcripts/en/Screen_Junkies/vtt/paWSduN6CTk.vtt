00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.650
<v 0>From the director of Porky's comes to Christmas classic.</v>

2
00:00:12.651 --> 00:00:14.540
You've seen a thousand times by now,

3
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.820
triple dog, dare you. Wait,

4
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.890
is this movie even good? Or do we just like it?

5
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.730
Cause we had the whole thing memorized a Christmas story.

6
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.470
This holiday season, when everyone in your family starts yelling at each other,

7
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.000
put on a Christmas story and entered the warm confines of a nostalgia to duck it

8
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.140
in a film that looks back fondly on the childhood.

9
00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:45.920
The narrator looks back fondly on that makes you look back fondly on watching it

10
00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:50.720
as a kid and returned to the American Midwest and the [inaudible] were listening

11
00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:54.350
to the radio is considered fun. You could still smack a kid around for laugh.

12
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.490
The toys sucked the real great depression,

13
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.880
trying to have fun with a wagon full of raggedy hands. Hey, well I'm heavy here.

14
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.590
Anyone want to send me the [inaudible] meet Ralphie begged before he got hot and

15
00:01:09.591 --> 00:01:13.820
executive produced Ironman follow along on a single-minded quest to acquire a

16
00:01:13.821 --> 00:01:18.680
firearm and fight against America's only form of gun control parents.

17
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.270
No, shoot your eye out as this little boy spends the entire film scheming for a.

18
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.860
<v 1>Gun. I want an official action. Do you want to join as well? Aaron dreaming.</v>

19
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.790
<v 0>About a gun and making up Atlanta's threats to justify owning a gun.</v>

20
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.850
<v 1>Will you come back? You'll be pushing up gates.</v>

21
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.110
<v 0>Is that what it feels like to be Republican gather round for a film that isn't</v>

22
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:42.890
really a bound family or generosity or Christmas,

23
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.150
but more about crass,

24
00:01:44.151 --> 00:01:48.860
materialism survival and the universal holiday message of stop

25
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.120
snitchin.

26
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.950
<v 2>Ready to tell me [inaudible] rough. Do you know where flake is?</v>

27
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.460
<v 0>Family and a DOE and boys. This one hanging by a thread. Dad's got rage issues.</v>

28
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.330
Mom's in the verge of a nervous breakdown. My.

29
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.230
<v 3>Mother, I had not had a hot meal for herself in 15 years.</v>

30
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.530
<v 0>And the little brother is a ball of anxiety and eating disorders held again.</v>

31
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.810
They're my park. Easy.

32
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.990
You just know they're about to shatter faster than a accidentally broken leg

33
00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:24.824
lamp.

34
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.170
<v 4>You use up all the glue on purpose</v>

35
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.370
bask.

36
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.710
<v 0>In the warmth of Jean Shepherd's radio voice.</v>

37
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.820
<v 3>The greatest Christmas gift I had ever received. What would ever receive as.</v>

38
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.650
<v 0>You revisit his favorite Christmas,</v>

39
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.760
where he got attacked in the streets at a mental breakdown eight.

40
00:02:43.761 --> 00:02:46.490
So God betrayed by his favorite show.

41
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.990
Got kicked in the hand by Santa's finally got what he wanted for Christmas and

42
00:02:50.991 --> 00:02:52.880
immediately shot himself in the face with it.

43
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.860
<v 4>Oh my God. I shot my eye. Oh.</v>

44
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.170
<v 0>Dear Lord. If this is the happiest time of his life,</v>

45
00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.100
I'd hate to see what happened.

46
00:02:58.101 --> 00:03:02.800
The other years did have to work in a coal mine did grandpa's get him so whip up

47
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:06.640
some Ovaltine and enjoy a movie that's like old cinematic wallpaper,

48
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.010
it's chipped and faded and we should probably replace it.

49
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.380
But at the same time,

50
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:17.830
it's comforting and familiar and we'll never get around to trying something new

51
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.740
because sure you can watch out for if you want to laugh out loud,

52
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.310
which also has Peter Billingsley in it or throwing Netflix to see whatever

53
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:27.850
random word the algorithm decided to pair with Christmas. But you know,

54
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.720
you'll just tune it to TNT or TBS and watch a Christmas story yet again,

55
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.330
stuck in the same loop of conflict and catharsis.

56
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:38.140
You can never escape from no matter how old you get. Huh?

57
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.640
I guess it is a movie by family.

58
00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:44.500
After all story fudge dread the

59
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:45.813
player's ball,

60
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.320
flag pole liquor. I love lamb. I hate lad,

61
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.610
Billy Bob Thornton, and you're wiser sign of liver disease.

62
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.170
He should really get that checked out.

63
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.800
<v 5>Gut focus. I heard you were slapping your soup suckers together.</v>

64
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.620
Tucking some trash about me calling me some names.

65
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.080
<v 0>That was a me honest. Do you want atomic.</v>

66
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.370
<v 5>Wedgie? How about a purple nurple when made my famous Indian arm burn. Hey.</v>

67
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.810
Oh, I want to just grab your own again. Why are you hitting yourself?

68
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.470
Why are you getting yourself out? Want me to stop? You better say it. You.

69
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.710
<v 4>Better say it. Oh God.</v>

70
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.980
<v 0>A Christmas sketch show. Jerk, Farkas, stupid bully.</v>

71
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.000
You know, setting aside the Ralphie probably wrote a rant about his gun.

72
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.320
The C plus is probably because he misspelled Christmas time.

73
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.910
<v 5>To go lick a frozen pool heads as little often at a</v>

74
00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:58.320
time. Be sure to drink year over routine.

75
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.990
I wanted official red rider, carbon action. 200 shot range model air, right.
