00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.520
<v 1>From the streaming studio with an infinite money code comes a film made for the</v>

2
00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:17.270
new home of action. Blockbusters, your couch,

3
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.790
the old guard you've seen Netflix turnout, disposable, romcoms,

4
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:24.350
Oscar baiting dramas,

5
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.700
and the home movies from Adam Sandler's least hilarious vacations. Now,

6
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.510
whatever AI they use to make programming decisions has found a new way to make

7
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:34.940
you look up from your phone for two minutes so they can count it.

8
00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:39.770
As of you take an ALA star and cram them into a B movie action flake.

9
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.690
Nope, not that one. Not that one. That one. Not that one.

10
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.010
There it is. As the studio spends big money on talent and uses.

11
00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:52.040
Whatever's left to cram action into an affordably tiny space.

12
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.530
Don't you guys want to go fight outside. It's such a nice day.

13
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.750
Meet the old guard,

14
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.620
a team of immortal mercenaries who can revive themselves with the power of

15
00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:07.850
moaning and grunting real hall.

16
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.153
<v 0>Uh.</v>

17
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.260
<v 1>Just got to resurrect my pancreas real quick.</v>

18
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.480
Crap rebirth crap.

19
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.160
These Illuma hotties have lived for hundreds to thousands of years with a

20
00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:31.850
burning desire to do good, even though they're really bad.

21
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.990
<v 0>We've done nothing. The world isn't getting any better.</v>

22
00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:37.670
It's getting worse because.

23
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.630
<v 1>They spend an eternity learning problem. A Gar boning celebrity.</v>

24
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.360
<v 0>Is this the Rodin? Did you know him.</v>

25
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.290
<v 1>Biblically and developing their palette?</v>

26
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.600
<v 0>Not Walnut black sea Rose water pomegranate Eastern</v>

27
00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:54.434
Turkey.

28
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.890
<v 1>They're not even that good at fighting.</v>

29
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.600
Normally normies get the drop on them all the time.

30
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.523
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

31
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.030
<v 1>This is just poor immortal time management me team leader, Andy,</v>

32
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.660
in a role that lets her Lee stretch her range from world weary.

33
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.553
We can do something.

34
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.030
<v 0>Good. Some good means nothing too exhausted. I gave up searching for her to.</v>

35
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.550
<v 1>Amine old Rumpelstiltskin, the broken.</v>

36
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.653
<v 0>Burn for all.</v>

37
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.370
<v 1>She straddles the crossroads of being the next Kiano Reis or being the next</v>

38
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:30.050
Gerard Butler of action movies.

39
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.730
She's the leader of an unable to commit suicide squad featuring newcomer,

40
00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:37.130
Nile, a Marine trained in expedition.

41
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.850
<v 0>So why is this happening to me? How are you out of them on trains? What's that.</v>

42
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.020
<v 1>Booker? Who likes books? Oh, first edition.</v>

43
00:02:45.021 --> 00:02:49.100
Don't chaotic and a pair of passionately medieval warrior lovers.

44
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.950
<v 0>He's the moon when I'm lost in darkness and warmth.</v>

45
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:55.580
When I share for wrinkles in his case still thrills me even after millennia.

46
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.880
<v 1>As if eternal life wasn't already enough of a girls' match.</v>

47
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.330
And at single next to a lovey-dovey couple here.

48
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.730
<v 0>Curable, romantic, kill me.</v>

49
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:06.803
<v 1>Together.</v>

50
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.010
Charlie's his angels will find their very own Bosley and unite to take down a

51
00:03:11.011 --> 00:03:15.270
guy who combines the dickish penis of Mark Zuckerberg from the social network

52
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.330
with a wardrobe of Justin Timberlake from the social network.

53
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.310
So strap in for a history spanning Epic full of intense action scenes,

54
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.500
except the heroes have every advantage.

55
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.360
And the villains are chump underdogs with zero chance that proves an all female

56
00:03:30.361 --> 00:03:33.900
crew behind the camera can get it done just as well as the fellows,

57
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.040
but due to the realities of streaming budgets mostly takes place in small rooms

58
00:03:38.041 --> 00:03:39.570
next to something more exciting.

59
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.960
<v 0>I thought you said we were going to Paris or just outside of Paris.</v>

60
00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.670
I felt that it was just outside of London and a van in mine.

61
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:48.803
Wow.

62
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.030
<v 1>And pumps the brakes on the thrills to set up some sequels because Netflix is</v>

63
00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:55.410
Skynet has already perceived.

64
00:03:55.411 --> 00:03:59.760
This will become your new favorite franchise and resistance is futile.

65
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.660
Then let's go to work, but Hey, we all have Shirley Sarone and axes.

66
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.690
What could go wrong? Right

67
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.470
story. Shirley's he on? If Beale street couldn't die,

68
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.290
schmuck, everlasting, Jafar and away, the cutest Mediterranean sniper.

69
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.770
She would tell NGO, Gord pharma, bro,

70
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.990
and iron man.

71
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.220
<v 0>Excellent.</v>

72
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.340
<v 1>Bad boys for life.</v>

73
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.360
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

74
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.210
<v 1>Thousands of years old. And that's your big catch phrase. See,</v>

75
00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:38.940
that's why you carry around a little notebook to jot ideas down on the go.

76
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.860
Want more old guard,

So you can decide what to watch. Go, boom.

79
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.390
Next this tea is nothing more than hot leaf juice.

80
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.130
If life isn't a video game, stop giving me fetch quests mother,

81
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.100
the new Chalupa box from taco bell.
