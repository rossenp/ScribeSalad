<v 1>This episode is sponsored by state form.</v>

2
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.500
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

3
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.120
<v 1>From 20th century studios. Okay. That just looks wrong.</v>

4
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.930
Comes a film that was set to be released in 2018,

5
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.530
until it got delayed to avoid Deadpool, to delayed again,

6
00:00:24.531 --> 00:00:29.270
to avoid dark Phoenix delayed again after Disney acquired box delayed again,

7
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.410
thanks to the Rona.

8
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.150
And after all that buildup and anticipation looks like the fourth best superhero

9
00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:36.650
movie of 1995.

10
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.540
<v 0>The new mutans.</v>

11
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.420
<v 1>It's been a long, strange trip at the movies for X-Men bans from good</v>

12
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.270
to great, to bad,

13
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.910
to worse.

14
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.500
Now roll the dice and enterovirus field theater to see what kind of

15
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.410
experience will bring the era to a close.

16
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.210
Then watch them crap out like the last toured in a dump before Kevin foggy can

17
00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:13.490
flush the whole thing down the toilet,

18
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.290
The new mutans who you'll come to wish were some kind of suicide squad there.

19
00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:25.070
Sam, the Kentucky boy with the personality of a Cola. Yeah.

20
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.860
<v 0>I had to go and work in the mines. My dad hates his job,</v>

21
00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:31.100
hates working in the mines with his dad, watched the call for my dad, gave him.

22
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.010
<v 1>To me, Roberto, the human pop color,</v>

23
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.760
a dag Arya stark who can walk into her dire Wolf.

24
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.840
Danny moon star, a girl who lives by that one,

25
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:44.600
native American proverb fitness influencers posted on their Instagram.

26
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.780
<v 0>Inside every person. There are two bears.</v>

27
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.430
I asked him which one wins Hansard, the one you feed.

28
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.060
<v 1>And Ilianna who hates being trapped in the facility.</v>

29
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.450
But since you can teleport must be sticking around for the racism.

30
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.740
<v 0>This isn't the hospital Pocahontas doesn't have to grow weeds or, you know,</v>

31
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.093
[inaudible], he's standing around you on the Buffalo wing.

32
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.790
<v 1>Experience, a superhero movie that redefines low budget,</v>

33
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.040
where they barely even use their powers.

34
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.990
Use your powers replay scenes from Logan and save money by

35
00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:22.640
not hiring a dialect coach.

36
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.900
<v 0>Seeing phones, terrible nightmares, lions and tigers and bears.</v>

37
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.311
<v 1>You'll thrill.</v>

38
00:02:28.311 --> 00:02:32.270
When Danny arrives at Savior's empty off-brand mutant teaching hospital,

39
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.700
a place with exactly one employee.

40
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.340
So the only Latino student has to do the cleaning

41
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.940
Together.

42
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.470
This party of five will undergo the old mutation equals puberty metaphor.

43
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.580
What's happening to me plus the usual act and horniness that comes with making

44
00:02:49.581 --> 00:02:50.570
teens live together.

45
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.280
<v 0>All while the evil Dr.</v>

46
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.770
<v 1>Rayez undergoes her sinister treatment plan,</v>

47
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.680
telling them all to chill a bunch of times.

48
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.600
<v 0>This we relax. You relax, calm down, calm, down,</v>

49
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.100
and control.

50
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.190
<v 1>Okay. Is anything actually going to happen in this movie?</v>

51
00:03:23.191 --> 00:03:26.640
Like a Mister sinister review or an X-Men cameo? No,

52
00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:28.500
maybe a demon smoke beer X Mokena.

53
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.650
Okay. The last one was a joke. You guys, what are you thinking?

54
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.250
Do you like horror? No. Good.

55
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.930
Neither does this movie who scary. No,

56
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.200
but every 20 minutes they'll remember it was popular ones.

57
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.160
So they might as well try some childhood trauma hallucinations where each Mutan

58
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.990
gets a PG 13 spooky flashback, but without the scary clown to make it all work.

59
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.250
And that's the movie they meet up, learn about each other's fears.

60
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.420
Then a bear pops out. You might as well watch Buffy instead. They certainly do.

61
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.880
Are we going to get copyright claim for this?

62
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.310
So try to enjoy a film that feels like a long pilot episode for a show that CW

63
00:04:20.311 --> 00:04:23.970
passed on that manages to be one quarter asked horror flag.

64
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.830
One quarter asked breakfast club,

65
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.090
one quarter asked why a romance and one quarter superhero movie.

66
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.160
And when you add all that up, you get something that's 100% complete.

67
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.650
I can't believe that I killed my grandma off to see this movie

68
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.140
story. Well. Well, well, if it isn't Slipknot,

69
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.940
the dad who can climb anything dream week. Yes.

70
00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:52.410
Hello. This is dog.

71
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.190
I don't want your life in mother Russia wig.

72
00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.440
Whereas you flame on flame off flame off gives good domes

73
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.470
nightmare at the Roxbury DOB air.

74
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.990
And I kiss the girl and I liked it that taste ever.

75
00:05:09.991 --> 00:05:14.520
Harry dogleg, teenage mutant spacing hurdles.

76
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.560
Okay. Danny can see into people's fears, but none to the future.

77
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.050
So when she sees those clips from Logan and Dr. Rayez head,

78
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.200
she's scared of that scene happening or do they just screw up the X-Men timeout

79
00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:29.580
again? Just for old time's sake. Oh, you guys, I'm not going to miss you at all.

80
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.530
This episode is sponsored by state farm, like a good neighbor state farm.

81
00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:38.940
Is there roses are red storm. Clouds are gray.

82
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.640
There is no war in bossing.

83
00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:46.050
Say I'm an auditor with a dark side

84
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.320
to him. I can't think of anything for him to say.
