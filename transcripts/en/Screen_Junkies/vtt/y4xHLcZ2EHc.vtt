00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.350
potlucks comes to Phil is based on a 15 year old Wattpad that

3
00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:22.840
became smash it's thanks to a demographic I've aged away out of, Hey.

4
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.750
<v 0>Hey, close on young lady at my day. Movie teens act that age appropriately.</v>

5
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.030
Oh yeah. That's better. Kissing booths.

6
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.770
<v 1>Get ready for an old school romcom with all the hallmarks of a John used classic</v>

7
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.880
sexual harassment, double standards for women.

8
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.650
And there you are treating her some slot.

9
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.690
You picked up at the club and Molly Ringwald as you journey to Los Angeles.

10
00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:55.220
So white you'll swear. You're actually in South Africa because you are,

11
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.570
that goes and gets into a fight on the first day of school. Great story.

12
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.100
Now about those blood diamonds,

13
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.100

14
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.690
<v 0>In spite of what happened tonight.</v>

15
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.390
I couldn't stop thinking about what Noah said to me.

16
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.630
<v 1>Voiceover butts in every five minutes, like a Netflix version.</v>

17
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.370
<v 0>Look, Libby. You obviously couldn't see this, but my heart just did a back flip.</v>

18
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:20.960
Yeah. That's what the Epping is.

19
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.760
Never great to hear your childhood crush say it's super gross in your pants.

20
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.150
<v 1>I'd want it to listen to this crap. I'd buy the audio book. Okay.</v>

21
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.403
Life throws curves.

22
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.240
<v 0>Shut up. Ah, this is all your fault. Kissing booth. Oh.</v>

23
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.120
<v 1>Set your lips to smooch.</v>

24
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.290
When El is caught between the Flynn brothers to do two's parents work in the

25
00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:46.700
money factory there's Lee who builds a friendship with them based on

26
00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:48.620
21 simple rules.

27
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.510
<v 0>Only your best friend gets to know your birthday wishes. Well, number seven,</v>

28
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.600
no matter how mad you are at your best friend, you have to forgive them.

29
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.500
If they give you ice cream rule number 18, always be happy for your well.

30
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.340
Number six, if you can't tell your best friend about something you're doing,

31
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.350
you probably shouldn't be doing number 19.

32
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.630
Always go to the same school as your member. Number two,

33
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.450
never share our secrets with anyone else. Number 16,

34
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.030
when your best he needs you there, you need to be on number five,

35
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.000
always do the Thanksgiving wishbone with your bestie.

36
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.630
<v 1>But rule nine says relatives are off limits. So no kissing his older brother,</v>

37
00:02:23.631 --> 00:02:27.770
Noah. Well, he has to keep his hands off. Her dad and little brother,

38
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.190
but rules were made to be broken and sparks will fly.

39
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.030
When Elle gets trapped in her very first abusive relationship, Izzy,

40
00:02:35.031 --> 00:02:36.410
violent check,

41
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.200
controlling, duh,

42
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.510
the car blames the victim natch wearing a skirt like that is asking

43
00:02:50.511 --> 00:02:54.560
for it. Still he's freakishly tall. And she got boobs over the summer.

44
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.270
So climb that red flag girl,

45
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.360
just get a burner phone and memorize the exits to a sixth gazebo. So creepy yet.

46
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:02.194
So hot

47
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.420
hormones will rage thanks to their high school blindfolded kissing booth,

48
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.960
which isn't just a gross idea that you'd get the entire school administration

49
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:11.794
can.

50
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.420
<v 0>It's.</v>

51
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.510
<v 1>Also the biggest cliche in teen fiction. Since the popular girl click,</v>

52
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:19.420
who just wants to start drama. Oh, they do that one too.

53
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.610
How about to get too wasted and table dancing?

54
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.990
<v 0>Wow. A big prom night finale.</v>

55
00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.610
<v 1>Uh, team Jacob Love triangle in the sequel.</v>

56
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.430
You have no business talking to me really well.

57
00:03:32.431 --> 00:03:33.960
Why don't you just throw in a dramatic,

58
00:03:33.961 --> 00:03:38.070
rather the airport sequence for good measure. It's cliches all the way down.

59
00:03:38.071 --> 00:03:41.730
People. This film exists for one reason. And one reason only.

60
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.390
<v 0>[Inaudible] wait. Who's filming him.</v>

61
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.550
<v 1>So settle it for some good old fashioned Zoomer escapism,</v>

62
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.950
where everyone is pretty finds love,

63
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.970
gets into Harvard and pays their way with dance, dance, revolution, tournament,

64
00:04:05.971 --> 00:04:09.150
winnings. But at the end of the day, they're still relatable.

65
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.040
Cause sometimes they fall down, go boo.

66
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.080
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

67
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.900
<v 1>In what may be two garbage films with horrible messages.</v>

68
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.530
But if they made movies out of the cringy stuff you wrote at 15, well,

69
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.310
I'm still taking offers for Ninja Viking versus boop Lee's Netflix.

70
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.323
Give me a call.

71
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.470
<v 0>That's a lifetime girl. Never got to happen. Story.</v>

72
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.360
<v 1>Simple. Ain't easy. I did not hit her as book. I did not. Uh,</v>

73
00:04:48.361 --> 00:04:52.230
highly paycheck, NP, melted plastics,

74
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.910
30 and flirty.

75
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.040
So many George teenagers.

76
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.320
Marco always has the last word.

77
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.890
Rachel never leaves happy.

78
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.780
<v 0>Rachel, Rachel and I never went into.</v>

79
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.480
<v 1>This old man on patrol, checking the sex gazebo,</v>

80
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.110
Not another teen movie until you've learned your lesson.

81
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.790
Does everyone in this movie delete their text history, shady.
