00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 0>This summer, we're getting honest about summer blockbusters, past and present.</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.250
This is honest trailers, blockbuster summer

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.730
From Disney and the criterion collections.

4
00:00:16.731 --> 00:00:21.650
Michael Bay comes the best title drop in a movie. Nick cage division.

5
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.740
<v 1>Welcome to con air. I like to take his face. Oh,</v>

6
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.100
welcome to the rock.

7
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.593
<v 0>Hell yeah.</v>

8
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.150
The rock Alcatraz has been captured by terrorists and

9
00:00:38.151 --> 00:00:40.430
San Francisco is in the crosshairs.

10
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.200
Now the only way to stop a dangerously unstable chemical weapon is with a

11
00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:47.300
chemically unstable dangerous man.

12
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.820
<v 1>I said, I want to find some rockets.</v>

13
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.800
<v 0>Meet Stanley Goodspeed.</v>

14
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.780
He's a scared little dork slash bad-ass adrenaline junkie slash Beatles

15
00:00:56.781 --> 00:01:00.980
freak. Who's big one-liner is an Elton John song. You're the rocket,

16
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.560
but don't worry. This irrational character.

17
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.640
It makes perfect sense because he's being played by nineties, Nick cage.

18
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.880
What do.

19
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.370
<v 1>You see? We cut the chit-chat a hall.</v>

20
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.050
<v 0>Although that's only because they couldn't get Arnold Schwartzenegger once that</v>

21
00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:16.100
makes even less sense.

22
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.820
<v 1>In the name of Sue says hall.</v>

23
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.800
<v 0>How in the name of justice? Pothole. Yeah, just doesn't work to take the rock.</v>

24
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.480
They need a man who knows it inside and out from it's mega man style fling traps

25
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.940
to the elaborate network of tunnels underneath,

26
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.410
which seems stupid at the time until he turned out to be real 20 years after the

27
00:01:36.411 --> 00:01:40.940
movie came out, help will come in the form of Mason, John Mason,

28
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.260
a man who demands you shut up and listen while he's talking because he adds a sh

29
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.450
to every word of her. Magisters.

30
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:49.370
<v 1>Retired.</v>

31
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.760
<v 0>Of course, together. They'll take on the robe general Frank Hummel,</v>

32
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.790
a retired war hero who is getting way too nice for this.

33
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.300
<v 1>You need to tell your teacher that you need to get back on the boat and go right</v>

34
00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:02.330
now. You're being detained against your will. For that. I apologize.

35
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.030
No one has to die here. I'm not ready to kill these people.

36
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.050
I'm not about to kill 80,000 innocent people. Do you think I'm out of my mind?

37
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.420
<v 0>How did this kindly old man survive Vietnam and everyone supported by a boat's</v>

38
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:18.320
worth of bad-ass character directors who get to look cool and say a couple of

39
00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:19.130
lines.

40
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.430
<v 1>What do you have a water pistol? You know, God well,</v>

41
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:26.270
I can't get my money.

42
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.540
<v 0>These guys, these are my Avengers right here.</v>

43
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.180
Get ready for Michael Bay to turn the Bay area into the Bay area with

44
00:02:35.181 --> 00:02:36.770
his signature explosions,

45
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.180
us military fetish and love of wheelchair athletes. Huh?

46
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.320
Never knows that one before,

47
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.940
because this movie about a chemical nerd and an old spy saving the day doesn't

48
00:02:46.941 --> 00:02:50.870
even start until after a whole other action movie about them teaming up in a

49
00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:54.560
film with so many well-directed action scenes you'll dare to ask,

50
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.320
is this what a good Michael Bay movie looks like? And to that we say yes,

51
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.730
come to think of it. All a base best of is rock based.

52
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.350
<v 1>Oh, Oh, I got my toe.</v>

53
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.630
<v 0>Can they reattach it? So to a little bit better than your best.</v>

54
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.500
<v 1>Losers, always whine about their best winners go home.</v>

55
00:03:16.501 --> 00:03:17.850
And the prom queen.

56
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.140
<v 0>For an on-screen cluster that was only matched by the one going on off screen</v>

57
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.320
with Sorkin and Tarantino being brought in for rewrites.

58
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.210
Co-producers ODing on cocaine during production and Bay walking off his

59
00:03:30.211 --> 00:03:33.510
own movie until they agreed to spend millions on a 32nd underwater.

60
00:03:33.511 --> 00:03:35.850
See basically this moment, but cool.

61
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.340
<v 1>Um, I take, I try to take people on an emotional ride and um,</v>

62
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.350
excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay.

63
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.280
<v 0>Story. We have no choice,</v>

64
00:03:50.281 --> 00:03:54.360
but to Stanley double load seven general grievance

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.860
Navy who can take a nerve gas during your face to

Welcome to the rock gentlemen. Dwayne Johnson.

<v 0>Hey fellas. If your girl asks you to communicate more in the bedroom,</v>

72
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.510
this is not what they mean.

73
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.460
<v 1>That's interesting. It's very compelling cream,</v>

74
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.110
peach sorbet persuasion.

75
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.930
