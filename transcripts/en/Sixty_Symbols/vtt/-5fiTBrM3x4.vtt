1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.740
<v 0>Black holes. Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.230
So do you wanna have a chat about how supermassive black holes grow?

3
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.820
Which is what I've been up to basically is figuring that out. So.

4
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.880
<v 1>Well, let me tell you what I think happens. Go ahead.</v>

5
00:00:09.881 --> 00:00:12.970
Don't they just sit in the middle of galaxies and just,

6
00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:15.350
just nibble up anything that comes to close. No.

7
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.270
<v 0>It can happen. They do just sort of get gas funneled to them in the galaxy.</v>

8
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.100
The thing is there are very massive, supermassive black holes in the universe,

9
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.950
and also we see them at incredible distances.

10
00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:32.690
So I very early on in the universe and there is a limit to how fast

11
00:00:32.691 --> 00:00:37.070
black holes can grow. Just by what we say, accreting material.

12
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.190
It's sort of like how, when you pull the plug hole out of a sink,

13
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.290
all the water doesn't immediately go down, right?

14
00:00:42.291 --> 00:00:44.750
There is some pressure that stops all of the water,

15
00:00:44.751 --> 00:00:46.640
just forcing itself down like a bottleneck, right?

16
00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:48.800
You have a bottleneck around a black hole essentially as well,

17
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.650
but we'll get there eventually, Ella we'll get there eventually. Yeah.

18
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.040
But there's a certain limit to how fast that can happen. So for example,

19
00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:59.330
we see supermassive black holes as early on as 800 million years into the

20
00:00:59.331 --> 00:01:00.290
university's lifetime.

21
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.520
Unfortunately it's not enough time to build a black hole in that way.

22
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.550
In the early universe, you see a black hole that say a billion times,

23
00:01:07.551 --> 00:01:08.690
the mass of the sun, right?

24
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.910
If you think it's had 8 million years to grow that big,

25
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.310
the liberate that it will be limited to.

26
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.020
That's physically not enough time for it to go that way.

27
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.720
And then you've also got things in the universe today.

28
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.570
Things like MSCI 87 black hole that's, you know,

29
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.480
tens of billions of times the mass of the sun is huge. Right?

30
00:01:23.481 --> 00:01:25.400
And so people think, well, how did it get that big?

31
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.960
Now the one correlation that we see is that the massive that black hole is

32
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:32.840
correlated with how big the galaxy is.

33
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.160
So it's like the two have grown up together essentially, right?

34
00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:40.370
So if you add more mass of the galaxy, you add more mass of the black hole,

35
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.230
but there's also a link between the size of the black hole and the middle part

36
00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:48.800
of a galaxy. So if you picture of a galaxy, it's got that sort of disc shape,

37
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.850
and then it's got this central bulge and it's even more tightly correlated with

38
00:01:52.851 --> 00:01:57.530
a massive that central bulge now where those bulges come from is from

39
00:01:57.531 --> 00:01:58.364
mergers.

40
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.380
So two galaxies merged together and you redistribute all the annual events and

41
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:07.580
the energy in that galaxy that kept all those stars on nice sort of circular

42
00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:09.320
orbits that we see. You can take it.

43
00:02:09.321 --> 00:02:12.740
So those stars are basically sank towards the center. And instead of on,

44
00:02:12.741 --> 00:02:16.070
you know, nice ordered orbits, they're on sort of like chaotic orbits,

45
00:02:16.071 --> 00:02:16.904
like a beehive,

46
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.830
but you can imagine that in a merger when stuff obviously then does sink to the

47
00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:24.320
center in this redistribution of energy,

48
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.900
then that material will also feed the black core.

49
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.630
And you'll also get the two black holes merging together.

50
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.530
<v 1>Are you saying the reason supermassive black holes can grow bigger than they</v>

51
00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:35.060
should is because of mergers.

52
00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:38.360
And they gobble up a whole other black hole because I would have thought with

53
00:02:38.361 --> 00:02:40.160
the bathtub, with the water going down,

54
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.480
if I suddenly came along with another bath tub full of water and just poured it

55
00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:48.260
on top or in it still wouldn't be able to get down that hole any quicker.

56
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.880
<v 0>You're not dumping the other black call onto what we call the accretion desk,</v>

57
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:55.400
which is sort of the bath tub of water. That's trying to spiral in.

58
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.670
You've almost merged the two pluck holes. So you've made the plug hole bigger.

59
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.600
So not only have you grown the black in that way,

60
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:04.060
you've then almost made it easier for it to, uh, create more material, right?

61
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:07.300
Because you've made it so that it has a bigger gravitational pole and it can

62
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:08.134
take more in.

63
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.960
So this is why people think those are so tightly correlated is because you get

64
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:13.390
the merger and you get extra growth from it.

65
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.600
And then you see that in the fact that the bigger that bulge gets,

66
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:18.190
the bigger your black hole gets as well.

67
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.430
So much that by the time you get to galaxies that are all bulge, you know,

68
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:24.940
these elliptical galaxies that are perfect steroids that have had all of that

69
00:03:24.941 --> 00:03:28.000
nice rotation destroyed in lots and lots of mergers over their lifetime,

70
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.390
they tend to have the biggest buck calls. And so over a long time,

71
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:34.750
people are like, that's how black holes grow. They grow emerges.

72
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.100
Look at this correlation.

73
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.110
Anything that doesn't have a bulge or has a very small bulge has

74
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.430
piddly black holes, right? Because it hasn't had any mergers. Exactly.

75
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:49.060
And because all it was able to grow with was your way you said at the start,

76
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:52.420
which was just sort of happily taking in whatever was around it.

77
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.870
And the work that we did, first of all, in my thesis,

78
00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.550
and I've followed up in the past couple of years as well was we took the

79
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:03.400
galaxies that don't have a Bush. And we said,

80
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.750
let's look at what mass those black holes actually are. Now.

81
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.850
You might've thought well, that would have been a really obvious thing to do,

82
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.060
but they're very, very rare. These galaxies, we, first of all,

83
00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:16.870
had to wait until there was a huge catalog of all the shapes of galaxies out

84
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:17.651
there that we could use,

85
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:20.380
which came with a classification site called galaxy zoo.

86
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.950
Hopefully some of your viewers will recognize it was the website that got people

87
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:25.180
to classify the shapes.

88
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:27.430
That's still going still needs help if people are up for it.

89
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.030
And with that sort of database, you never in a million galaxies.

90
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:34.330
We could start with, to look at, we ended up with a hundred of them,

91
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.570
of these things that didn't have bulges. So that just shows how rare they are.

92
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.120
They're also things with growing black holes as well.

93
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.840
So the way you get at the max and you actually measure the mass of the black

94
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:48.370
hole is you measure how fast the material that spiraling around it is going,

95
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.240
which means it has to be actively growing for us to be able to spot them.

96
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.450
So when that happens, that material starts to glow.

97
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.210
This is what we call like a quasar. When it's gray, like going very,

98
00:04:58.211 --> 00:05:00.790
very brightly, right. Sometimes goes in the x-ray,

99
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:03.490
but also it can go in the obstacle. And so when that happens,

100
00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:05.920
you also get emission from hydrogen gas.

101
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.750
And so you've got the sort of radiation coming from this material that then

102
00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:14.350
impacts the atoms and hydrogen excites the electrons.

103
00:05:14.351 --> 00:05:17.770
So if you remember chemistry from GCSE is you have your electrons in your

104
00:05:17.771 --> 00:05:19.720
orbits, they jump up one.

105
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.780
And then when they drop back down there and it has very specific color or

106
00:05:22.781 --> 00:05:27.370
wavelength of light. And so if you were to take a spectrum of that gas,

107
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.560
that's orbiting around that galaxy where you split the light,

108
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.130
you would hopefully see this giant peak at that hydrogen color or Waveland.

109
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.190
What you see though is instead of it being a very specific wavelength,

110
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.690
it sort of smeared out and that's because half of the gas is coming towards you.

111
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.020
So it's blue shifted and half of it's moving away from you. So it's red shifted.

112
00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.440
So if you can imagine how far that gas has been, sort of Schmid out,

113
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.950
you can measure how big the black court is because we know how fast the thing is

114
00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:52.720
moving. You know, how big the thing is moving around,

115
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.810
which blew my mind as a PhD student being like, Oh,

116
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.530
look from this line that does this.

117
00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:59.960
I can tell you how big the supermassive black hole is.

118
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.780
This seems like a lot of room for error in this process, but yeah,

119
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.850
but it's still possible.

120
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.890
So we looked at these things and we found that they obviously didn't lie on

121
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:12.830
this correlation of black hole mass in bulge mass,

122
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.230
but this is the line where this is everything nice. He sits.

123
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:16.790
And he has the most massive things,

124
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:18.920
the most massive borders and the most massive black holes,

125
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.810
all our borderless things were over here.

126
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.100
So these are galaxies that haven't had mergers that have somehow grow in that

127
00:06:25.101 --> 00:06:29.270
black hole, just as big without merging with any other black holes. Well,

128
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:32.750
how to do it. Exactly. So this is what we're now trying to figure out, right?

129
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.330
Is that yeah. Okay. We go back to this idea of, okay,

130
00:06:35.331 --> 00:06:38.750
black holes can accrete material that's around them,

131
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.860
but it's limited to how fast it can do that. Fine. But how does it,

132
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:43.730
first of all, get there.

133
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.700
So the galaxies we're looking at with these Borgias things,

134
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:49.920
they're very pure sort of spiral galaxies. They've been left alone,

135
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:53.840
their entire lives, right? So a lot of them have beautiful spiral arms there.

136
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.910
Some of them have these bar structures in as well.

137
00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.890
And so the leading hypothesis is that they funnel gas in and they funnel stuff

138
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.290
to the center. Now,

139
00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:04.790
all the work that's been done looking at the limit of the black hole was

140
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:06.890
obviously done in other galaxies and not in this.

141
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.950
So there are some ideas that that could be different possibly,

142
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:12.080
and that could be affected by the properties of the black hole.

143
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.670
The paper had last year was trying to work out what rate that material is being

144
00:07:16.671 --> 00:07:20.000
floated in up basically. And whether that will affect things slightly.

145
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.660
So we looked at a small, a number of these galaxies looked about 10 of them.

146
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.350
I somehow managed to call them after Harry Potter characters in the paper.

147
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.560
I got that past the referee. And I was very, very pleased with myself.

148
00:07:30.561 --> 00:07:32.930
It was all about what color I'd highlighted them on the page,

149
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.220
like to observe that night,

150
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:37.070
it was like the red ones had to be observed on Tuesday night.

151
00:07:37.071 --> 00:07:40.010
So they were all named after Griffin doors, the green ones of Wednesday nights.

152
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.760
And it was literally when we looked at these galaxies, what we found was that,

153
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.890
um, their accretion rates of the black hole, the amount of material,

154
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:53.540
these black calls we're taking in we're five times higher than in, uh,

155
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.270
a sample of galaxies that had undergone these mergers.

156
00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.400
But the crucial thing was is that unlike a bathtub where all the water

157
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.900
goes down, the park hall,

158
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.730
can you imagine if you took out the plug hole and the pressure around it

159
00:08:07.731 --> 00:08:11.330
built up so much in that bottle neck, that it threw water back at you,

160
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.200
this is what black holes do, right? I like to say that they burp, essentially.

161
00:08:15.201 --> 00:08:19.580
They're trying to take in so much at once that the easiest thing to do is that

162
00:08:19.581 --> 00:08:22.340
pressure builds up and builds up is to throw some material back out.

163
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.050
Now doesn't come from the black hole.

164
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:27.260
And that's what confuses a lot of people is it happens before the material,

165
00:08:27.261 --> 00:08:29.930
you know, reaches that event, horizon that point of no return.

166
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:34.850
What we found is that in galaxies that have had these huge mergers,

167
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:36.770
you reach that pressure point sooner.

168
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.460
And so actually you have the Burt point. Exactly.

169
00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:44.810
So these galaxies that have mergers are actually burping up five times more than

170
00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:45.950
our galaxies, that haven't.

171
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.470
So our got axes that haven't are still birthing a little bit.

172
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.390
They're just not doing a giant megaphone.

173
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.330
They're actually taking in more material than the ones that have had mergers.

174
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.700
Cause the ones that had mergers or just throwing most of it back out again.

175
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.890
<v 1>So it's almost like if you've had a merger,</v>

176
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:01.800
the black holes a bit more full and doesn't want to eat as much.

177
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.470
<v 0>Exactly. Yeah. It's already merged with another one.</v>

178
00:09:03.471 --> 00:09:06.460
It's like I've done and the galaxies, but it is work for theater.

179
00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.420
Then you end up with this huge book. But the thing is,

180
00:09:08.421 --> 00:09:10.310
what also happens is that, um,

181
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:15.350
the ha the faster a black hole itself spins the more efficient it is it

182
00:09:15.351 --> 00:09:19.370
accretion and th that they can push up that limit. So, and this is very,

183
00:09:19.371 --> 00:09:22.040
this was a very important thing that we concluded in this paper was that if you

184
00:09:22.041 --> 00:09:26.780
think about how the black hole is actually getting this material and a galaxy

185
00:09:26.781 --> 00:09:30.470
that hasn't had a merger that's been left alone has its nice pure desk.

186
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.720
It's all coming in from the same angle.

187
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:36.260
And so it's always going to spin up and spin up and spin up the black hole,

188
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.930
whereas in a merger of two galaxies,

189
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.600
that funnel stuff towards the center and syncs up, present it,

190
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:45.140
that's going to be coming from all different directions. And so wasp.

191
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.190
<v 2>Sorry, could you be more English?</v>

192
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.383
<v 0>These? Yes, no,</v>

193
00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.650
but in a merger where you've had two galaxies merged together and all that

194
00:10:00.651 --> 00:10:03.410
material is coming from all sorts of different directions,

195
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.710
then that black hole is going to be getting some material from this direction,

196
00:10:06.711 --> 00:10:09.650
which will spin it out this way, but then some material from this direction,

197
00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:11.540
which will spin it back the opposite way.

198
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.170
And so what we found was that the sort of average thing that was probably

199
00:10:15.171 --> 00:10:17.390
happening is that emerge the galaxies,

200
00:10:17.391 --> 00:10:19.880
the black color is being spun down as we call it,

201
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.810
it's being averaged back to zero. Whereas in our borders, galaxies,

202
00:10:23.811 --> 00:10:27.830
it's being spun up all the time and it's accretion is getting more efficient and

203
00:10:27.831 --> 00:10:31.670
that's what allows them to grow so big because it's sort of like the sort of

204
00:10:31.671 --> 00:10:35.630
slow and steady tortoise rather than sort of the greedy hair in a way.

205
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:36.800
<v 1>I didn't know,</v>

206
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.560
material from outside of black hole could spin up the black hole that way.

207
00:10:39.561 --> 00:10:42.890
I thought once it crossed the event horizon, like all information is lost.

208
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:45.500
<v 0>Parrots, the angular momentum of the material that falls in,</v>

209
00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:46.843
which is quite cool,

210
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.970
these results that we had were done with what's called narrowband imaging.

211
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.930
So instead of taking a spectrum of light where you get sort of the emission from

212
00:10:53.931 --> 00:10:56.690
one specific element, instead, what you do is you say, okay,

213
00:10:56.691 --> 00:10:58.100
given the Redshift of that galaxy,

214
00:10:58.101 --> 00:11:01.340
I know this element submission will be around about this wave once.

215
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.880
And so I'm only going to let in light from that specific wavelength and take an

216
00:11:04.881 --> 00:11:09.350
image in that narrow strip. And then from that you can sort of then work out,

217
00:11:09.351 --> 00:11:12.290
well, how much energy is in that? Because all of these burps,

218
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.240
they tend to be very energetic and they will, um, excite these electrons,

219
00:11:17.241 --> 00:11:20.720
but in oxygen, in the galaxy, right? So if we can just observe oxygen,

220
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.140
then we can just get it, you know, what's going on in that bit. But again,

221
00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:28.310
what you need is this data where instead of just taking one spectrum,

222
00:11:28.311 --> 00:11:29.840
either from the very center of the galaxy,

223
00:11:29.841 --> 00:11:32.750
you can split it into a jigsaw and take lots and lots and lots of them.

224
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:36.500
So you not only can find out where the sort of birth emission is and therefore

225
00:11:36.501 --> 00:11:37.820
work at how much there is of it.

226
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.030
You can also figure out what impact it's having on the galaxy,

227
00:11:41.031 --> 00:11:44.480
around it as well. Cause that kind of throwing back out of energy,

228
00:11:44.481 --> 00:11:47.180
back into the guide. So you can then have a huge effect on the galaxy itself,

229
00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.240
right? It can heat gas up that you need to make stars.

230
00:11:50.241 --> 00:11:53.680
It can expel gas from a galaxy. So there's huge repercussions.

231
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.450
So it's really important to understand the,

232
00:11:55.451 --> 00:11:59.320
how this tiny little process can have this huge impact everywhere else.

233
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.900
And what's interesting to me, is that like, okay, yes,

234
00:12:01.901 --> 00:12:05.710
mergers were almost like the low hanging fruit that was easy to spot.

235
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.570
That was like, this is clear what's happening.

236
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:12.190
But it seems as if this sort of funneling of gas is happening in every galaxy

237
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.360
all the time,

238
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.250
but then you only see the after effects of the merger because it's so apparent.

239
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.120
Right? And that was like the key thing that happened that you noticed first,

240
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.570
we had some simulation friends as well that simulated this happening and they

241
00:12:25.571 --> 00:12:29.260
showed that 65% of all the stuff,

242
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:33.130
all the matter that's currently found in supermassive black holes in the

243
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:37.540
universe got there because of this funneling processed in

244
00:12:37.541 --> 00:12:39.820
galaxies, not because of mergers.

245
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:44.380
So we've sort of flipped the hypothesis on its head that black holes grow by

246
00:12:44.381 --> 00:12:45.310
mergers. And we're like,

247
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:49.210
actually looks like the majority of the time that ain't what you said at the

248
00:12:49.211 --> 00:12:51.970
beginning, right? Just happily taking them whatever's given to them.

249
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.060
<v 3>So we are in the black hole laboratory. What you're looking at,</v>

250
00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.490
that's an analog rotating black holes.

251
00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.150
They are about 2000 liters of water in there. If you follow me here,

252
00:13:03.151 --> 00:13:05.640
we have a toolbox which we can open.

253
00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:10.860
<v 4>It was really thin the picture of her majesty,</v>

254
00:13:10.861 --> 00:13:13.890
the queen, which is just the vague shadow.
