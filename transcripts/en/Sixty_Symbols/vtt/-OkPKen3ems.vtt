00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>I thought for once I'd talk about my own science. Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.760
Which I don't usually do. I usually talk about more general things in science,

3
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.650
but I talk about some of the research that I've been doing,

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.180
or actually perhaps more correctly.

5
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:13.440
Some of the research that mostly Tom Pitkin he's my PhD student has been doing

6
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.200
time.

7
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.530
<v 1>Slicing times, slicing spiral.</v>

8
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.200
<v 0>Galaxies with SDSs, for manga. What does that.</v>

9
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.480
<v 1>Mean? Where do we start to tell the story?</v>

10
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.590
<v 0>We probably need to back up a bit and talk a little bit about galaxies.</v>

11
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.150
Here's a couple of galaxies, a couple of nice spiral galaxies,

12
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.610
and we can come back to talk a little bit about what the hexagons mean,

13
00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:31.350
but for the moment, just look at the pictures of the galaxies.

14
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.040
Probably the most telling difference between these two pictures is that one of

15
00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:37.050
them is blue and the other isn't stars are different.

16
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:40.140
Masses have different colors. The most massive stars tend to be blue.

17
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.420
And then the less massive stars tend to be red.

18
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.230
So whenever you see blue light that tells you there are massive stars there,

19
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:48.330
which means that the stars must have formed recently,

20
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.100
a blue color tells you that a galaxy is actively forming stars and a red color

21
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:55.920
tends to tell you that it probably isn't so accurately forming stars.

22
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.310
What slightly complicates the story is that there are other things that can make

23
00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:03.000
galaxies blue or red as well. So for example, if a galaxy appears red,

24
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:04.980
it could be that it's intrinsically blue,

25
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:09.030
but there's a whole load of this dusty material between you and the galaxy and

26
00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:11.820
dust tends to absorb the blue light, but let the red light through.

27
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:15.000
So you end up just seeing the red light. So it could be a dusty galaxy.

28
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.780
The other possibility is it could be a galaxy that has a lot of heavy elements

29
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:23.550
in it, in that heavy elements, absorb light at different parts of the spectrum.

30
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.820
And they tend to be better at absorbing blue light than they are at absorbing

31
00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:29.520
red light. So therefore you end up absorbing a bunch of them,

32
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.730
of the blue light that would have been emitted, but you still see the red light.

33
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.361
Fortunately,

34
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:36.390
you can do a bit better than just looking at the colors and in particular,

35
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:40.170
you can split the whole thing up into the complete spectrum so that all the

36
00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:42.900
colors of the rainbow and study in detail,

37
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.670
what the light is at different wavelengths.

38
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.980
Here's an example of what happens when you do that.

39
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.290
And this is looking at different stellar populations,

40
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:52.020
and there are different things in here that there are different ages of stellar

41
00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:54.210
populations, and there are different amounts of heavy elements,

42
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.030
but the only things really to take away from this is,

43
00:01:56.031 --> 00:01:59.070
so this is basically how much light there is as a functional wavelength,

44
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.360
starting at the blue end of the spectrum,

45
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:03.240
and ending up at the red end of the spectrum. So this is the intensity of light,

46
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.260
it's kind of a continuum.

47
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.290
And then there was these little dips and very specific wavelengths.

48
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.250
And these dips aware some particular chemical elements is absorbing star light.

49
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.700
So this whole very kind of regular series of lines here, for example,

50
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.830
all due to hydrogen. And as I say,

51
00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:21.570
these different lines are for different assumes ages and different assumed heavy

52
00:02:21.571 --> 00:02:23.010
element abundances, and they're all different.

53
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.560
So you can actually sort of disentangle the, all these different effects.

54
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.740
So if you were to, to take the spectrum of a galaxy,

55
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.920
you could actually use this kind of information to tell what,

56
00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:33.030
why the galaxy was red,

57
00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:36.030
white with blue and sort of distinguished between these different effects.

58
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.070
One of the games we can now play,

59
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.060
are we things called integral field units or use where instead of taking one

60
00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:43.140
spectrum at a time,

61
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.560
you take a whole bunch of spectra from all across the face of a galaxy.

62
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.220
So we can do this kind of across an entire galaxy, all in one go.

63
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.810
And so actually this hexagon on these pictures are sort of the footprint of the

64
00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:56.820
area where we've actually been playing this game.

65
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.860
And the reason why it's a hexagon is because the way that this is actually done

66
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:02.920
in practice for this particular survey is that there's a whole bunch of optical

67
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:05.410
fibers, which have been arranged in a hexagonal pattern.

68
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.440
And each of those fibers captures a little bit of light and gets fed into a

69
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.690
spectrograph and the spectrograph records, the spectrum.

70
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.930
So essentially we can kind of recall the spectrum at every point across the

71
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:16.570
entire face of the galaxy. And so this is actually a survey,

72
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:17.890
it's this thing called manga.

73
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.380
It's a project I've been involved in for a number of years. Now.

74
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.740
There's hundreds of astronomers involved in it as part of an even bigger project

75
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:27.310
called the Sloan digital sky survey. The mango project is doing this,

76
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.701
essentially,

77
00:03:27.701 --> 00:03:31.390
this recording spectral all across the face of galaxy for 10,000 galaxies.

78
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.540
So that's one part of the thing that's new that we can actually do this kind of

79
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:38.050
analysis across entire galaxies at a time, the other bit that's new.

80
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:42.820
And the bit that my PhD student Tom's been working on is that what he's been

81
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:46.750
able to show is that actually you can do better than just saying,

82
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.350
is it this or this in that this assumes that the gut, you know, the,

83
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:52.450
all the stars of the galaxy are one age, right?

84
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.660
They're all 10 billion years old, or they're all a billion years old, of course,

85
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:58.180
in a real galaxy. That's not what happens in a real galaxy.

86
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.070
There's some stars which are young stumps stars, which are,

87
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:01.570
middle-aged some stars which are old.

88
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.510
And of course the light you get from them will just be the sum of all those

89
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:07.600
different spectrum. What we've been able to show you can kind of disentangle it,

90
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.120
which means that you can take a spectrum and say, ah,

91
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.770
this bit of the galaxy is 30% old star, 60% middle-aged stars,

92
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.830
uh, and the remaining 10% young stars or something like that.

93
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:20.170
So you can actually disentangle all these different things.

94
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.750
And that's this thing called time slicing that essentially we take the whole

95
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:25.900
galaxy and say, okay, so 10% of the light is young,

96
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.550
this mildly middle-aged and so on,

97
00:04:27.551 --> 00:04:31.600
we can actually go through the entire life history of the galaxy and kind of

98
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.260
speak it up into his parts. So the actually is for this gallery,

99
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:38.080
one of those galaxies I showed you before, this actually is this galaxy.

100
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.290
It has a very uninspiring name in, uh, the pollens of this survey.

101
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.820
It's eight three, two nine miners one, two seven Oh one. It needs a name.

102
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.770
What's the student's name again? Tom Peter kin.

103
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.520
<v 1>Pizza gins, galaxy tuck-ins galaxy. There you go. That's better.</v>

104
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.001
<v 0>Here.</v>

105
00:04:51.001 --> 00:04:55.350
We all going through and slicing through the galaxy from the oldest stars to the

106
00:04:55.351 --> 00:04:58.140
youngest star. So we start with the oldest stars here in the middle,

107
00:04:58.141 --> 00:05:02.580
and then we go through middle-aged stars, youngest stars.

108
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.130
So the first thing says formal right in the middle,

109
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.990
very centrally concentrated over time.

110
00:05:06.991 --> 00:05:09.210
It grew outwards form this disc around it.

111
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.090
And then the latest stars with seeing now forming in this moment,

112
00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:15.210
arms that's when you start happening at spiral arm. Exactly.

113
00:05:15.211 --> 00:05:16.140
So it's actually telling you,

114
00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:19.530
this is where star formation is happening now because actually that's the

115
00:05:19.531 --> 00:05:22.080
strong, most intense star formation happens in the spiral and arms.

116
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.270
The other interesting piece of information to remember, I said,

117
00:05:24.271 --> 00:05:25.800
not only do you get the ages of the stars,

118
00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:28.680
but you get to learn about what their heavy element abundances are as well.

119
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.880
And the slightly sort of counter-intuitive thing is the color coding here is

120
00:05:32.881 --> 00:05:35.250
basically telling you what the heavy element of abundance is,

121
00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:39.840
are in that the reddest colors of the highest heavy element abundance and the

122
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.240
blue is colors are the lowest heavy element abundances.

123
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.930
And so what you can actually see is that those first stars to form is quite red.

124
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.670
And so they have a lot of heavy elements in them.

125
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.720
Now that doesn't seem to make much sense, because remember I said,

126
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.090
the way you get the heavy elements is by having success in generations of stars.

127
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.060
And yet you to thought the first thing stars to form the Cod have been

128
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.030
successive generations of stars to make that happen.

129
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.610
What this is telling you is that in that inner region,

130
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.330
the must've been very quick turnaround and making lots and lots of stars and

131
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:09.320
many generations of stars very quickly to kind of crank up that heavy element

132
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.840
abundance. And then as the thing we're outwards,

133
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:14.720
you're making more and more stars out of more and more kind of pristine

134
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:17.090
material. That's falling into the galaxy. That's,

135
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.340
hasn't been through so many generations of stars.

136
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.640
So that I guess probably is not something you would have sort of assumed if you

137
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:23.810
hadn't actually seen the picture here,

138
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:26.540
you might have assumed that the stuff in the middle she'd have the lowest heavy

139
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:27.950
element abundance. Whereas actually,

140
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:30.410
this is telling you that the story is a bit more complicated than that.

141
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:32.970
And actually there must've been lots of generations of stars.

142
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.450
<v 2>And it's just telling you that the stars are being made from new material coming</v>

143
00:06:37.451 --> 00:06:42.130
from outside. Not what's been sped up by the old dead guys for the most part.

144
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:45.100
<v 0>Although it doesn't have zero chemical and heavy element abundances.</v>

145
00:06:45.101 --> 00:06:49.180
So it's sort of telling you that there must've been some processing within the,

146
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.270
this, but actually it's more pristine. It's, it's, it's,

147
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.540
it's more kind of new gas falling in. That's making the,

148
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:56.950
those outer parts of the galaxy,

149
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:02.140
the technical aspects of doing this is quite difficult in that you've somehow

150
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.940
this, this aspect of it,

151
00:07:03.941 --> 00:07:08.080
of disentangling all those different components to figure out uniquely what the

152
00:07:08.081 --> 00:07:12.580
thing was made of is actually really quite technically challenging and

153
00:07:12.581 --> 00:07:13.151
complicated.

154
00:07:13.151 --> 00:07:15.970
So a lot of the process has been going through a lot of testing to say,

155
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.320
you know, if we make an,

156
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.350
make a galaxy ourselves where we know what the components are,

157
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.430
and then we kind of sort of pretend to observe it and add a bit of noise as we

158
00:07:24.431 --> 00:07:28.450
would actually get in a real galaxy, can we then get back out what we put in,

159
00:07:28.451 --> 00:07:29.284
in the first place?

160
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.320
And so there's a lot of testing you need to go through in order to do this,

161
00:07:32.321 --> 00:07:35.380
to convince yourself, you really are doing this slicing things up in time,

162
00:07:35.381 --> 00:07:36.880
rather than just randomly fitting company.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.820
If you have a Jetta material coming out of the center of galaxy and it starts to

164
00:07:51.821 --> 00:07:54.670
wiggle around, that's probably this Kelvin Helmholtz instability as well.

165
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.120
It's basically wherever you have two streams of material traveling at different

166
00:07:58.121 --> 00:08:00.760
speeds. This instability will kick in.
