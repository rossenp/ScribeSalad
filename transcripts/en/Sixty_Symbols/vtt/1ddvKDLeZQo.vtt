1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.960
<v 0>I thought we'd talk about a tweak by some guy called Brady Herron,</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.110
who put a picture up saying what's going on here. So I thought we would talk.

3
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.490
<v 1>That's me. That's you, there's a rainbow there,</v>

4
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.890
but up there there's like these double rainbows up above

5
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.330
Sunday, here's these double rainbows

6
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.850
and then the normal one. So kind of fading out there.

7
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.810
<v 0>What you're actually seeing is in a very indirect way,</v>

8
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.520
the structure of a molecule,

9
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.450
this is an electron microscope picture of a snowflake, which has six fold,

10
00:00:35.451 --> 00:00:36.950
symmetry, exactly, or symmetry to it.

11
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.480
I don't really want to look at the snowflake.

12
00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:40.400
I want to look up these little hexagons all around.

13
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.210
You see that little ice crystals that form in the atmosphere usually have this

14
00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:47.150
kind of hexagonal structure to them in the 17th century.

15
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.160
Yohanas Kepler the Royal astronomer for emperor Rudolph the second,

16
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.070
as well as the way we astronomers in general, throughout time,

17
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.350
the person who was supposed to be paying him, wasn't paying him.

18
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.790
So he had no money and it was coming up to Christmas and he wanted a present for

19
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:04.820
a friend of his, and he was kind of walking across Prague in the snow.

20
00:01:04.821 --> 00:01:08.390
The star was coming down and he saw these snowflakes on his jacket and became

21
00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:10.970
interested in the fact that they had this six-fold symmetry to them.

22
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.080
And so he wrote an essay about the six-fold symmetry of snow,

23
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.090
which he gave as a Christmas present to his friend.

24
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.580
And so it was a cheap gift basically, but in that essay,

25
00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:21.980
he talked about why it has the six fold shape.

26
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.440
And he drew this sort of analogy with beehives. You know,

27
00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:26.690
they have the hexagonal structure inside beehives,

28
00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:30.290
and he pointed out that this is the way that you can pack the most into a given

29
00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:33.320
space. The hexagons have this interesting property that they kind of tessellate

30
00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:35.480
together and you'll compact things as closely together.

31
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.300
So we had this idea that it was something to do with the way that the smaller

32
00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:40.460
structures that went in to the snowflake,

33
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.550
what we would now think of as molecules take up this exact and we'll structure

34
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.620
it. Cause that's the way to pack the maximum of the mean.

35
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:46.791
And indeed that's what's happening.

36
00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:49.490
Water molecules arranged themselves in such a way that they formed a little

37
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.340
Mexicans and then the little hexagons joined together to form bigger hexagons

38
00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:54.710
and so on until you get all the way up to snowflakes,

39
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.080
the smaller structures that happen much more often than snowflake.

40
00:01:57.081 --> 00:02:00.620
So these little exec and all sort of flat-ish hexagonal shapes, and they're,

41
00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:03.920
what's responsible for your halo in any cloud.

42
00:02:03.921 --> 00:02:07.400
You've got these little hexagonal crystals forming and they tend to orientate

43
00:02:07.401 --> 00:02:09.710
themselves flat just because that's the stable thing.

44
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:11.600
If you think about leaves fluttering down from a tree,

45
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.150
and it's the same in clouds, you have these crystals form.

46
00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:16.190
And as long as there's not too much turbulence in the cloud,

47
00:02:16.191 --> 00:02:18.350
they'll just sort of settle into these orientations.

48
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.020
So you've got a cloud which is basically full of these little hexagonal

49
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:22.430
crystals, all aligned like that.

50
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.020
And then you've got the sunlight shining on them.

51
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.580
They're not completely transparent.

52
00:02:25.581 --> 00:02:27.470
So they like little bits of glass or whatever.

53
00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:29.480
They haven't got a refractive index to them,

54
00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:32.210
which means that as light passes through them, it gets bent by them.

55
00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:34.970
And in fact, light of different colors gets bent by different amounts.

56
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.750
The bright arc that you're seeing in the image that you took is actually where

57
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.120
the light from the sun is coming in at sort of an oblique angle.

58
00:02:41.121 --> 00:02:43.220
It goes in through the top and then out through the side.

59
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.110
But each time it goes through one of those services,

60
00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:46.700
the path of the light gets bent a bit.

61
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.850
Cause it's parsing from one medium air to another medium lice.

62
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.880
Why does it make an arc? So the reason it makes an arc,

63
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:55.250
if you look at these things, because they're all aligned, you think about it,

64
00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:59.030
the lights coming in, it said he always different crystals at the same angle,

65
00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.920
the vertical,

66
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.550
and then it's passing through a surface which bends that vertical angle a bit.

67
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.460
And then through a horizontal surface, which bends that angle a bit more.

68
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.100
So the light came in and then got bent a bit, then got bent a bit more.

69
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.911
So the light,

70
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:12.490
instead of coming from over there is now coming from higher in the sky or

71
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:14.080
appears to be coming from higher in the sky.

72
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.730
But one thing that we haven't factored in is,

73
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:17.230
although these things are all flat,

74
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.570
their orientation in the other direction is random.

75
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.140
And so that means sometimes it comes out sort of perpendicular to one of these

76
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:23.501
faces.

77
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:27.190
And sometimes it comes out at an angle to them that adds another refraction.

78
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:30.910
So we, the, the amount of the light is bent in the vertical direction is fixed,

79
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.840
but the amount it's been kind of azimuth really around just depends on what

80
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:36.880
angle of surface it exits through.

81
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.210
So the light is always kind of coming from the same direction vertically,

82
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:44.590
but gets bent around depending on how it exits from that vertical face of the

83
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:47.050
crystal. And so that's why you see the light coming from an arc.

84
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.420
<v 2>So that.</v>

85
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.840
<v 0>Explains this thing, as I say, which is called a circumstantial arc.</v>

86
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.810
So it's circumstantial cause anything's in the straight up direction and it's

87
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:56.740
around the Zenith.

88
00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.230
They all come from the same direction relative to the vertical,

89
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:00.580
but different angles around.

90
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.540
So you end up with an arc straight up is up here somewhere and this,

91
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.570
so this is a circle around, straight up. This thing is actually much rarer.

92
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.870
That's called a super lateral arc. And that occurs because,

93
00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:13.420
so although all the crystals that water forms,

94
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:16.090
at least that sort of atmospheric pressure have this hexagonal symmetry,

95
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.490
they don't always end up as these little flat things.

96
00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:19.570
That's the most common thing,

97
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.990
but another possibility is they can actually grow into cylinders.

98
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.440
Cylinders also tend to orient the tape themselves in a particular direction.

99
00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:29.350
They tend to orientate themselves with their long axis, parallel to the earth.

100
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.220
You've got the light coming in through one of the long sides and then out

101
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:35.200
through the flat end. But in this case,

102
00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:38.800
you can see that the all kind of being bent around an axis,

103
00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:41.350
which is parallel to the earth rather than perpendicular to the earth.

104
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.260
The thing that you can change in this one is you can rotate that cylinder

105
00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:44.770
around,

106
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.950
which means that the light always gets bent around the kind of a horizontal

107
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:50.710
axis, but what angle around that horizontal axis,

108
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:53.470
it gets bent to depends on the orientation of this crystal.

109
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.650
So this thing was around the vertical axis. This is actually a, an arc,

110
00:04:56.651 --> 00:04:58.150
which is around the horizontal axis.

111
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.160
And that's why it's a normal way out for our rainbow.

112
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.020
It was just an axis pointing to you.

113
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:05.230
And you end up with this arc around that horizontal axis. These are much rarer.

114
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:07.600
You'll see one of these about once a year, rather than about, you know,

115
00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:08.500
a dozen times a year.

116
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.590
What you're actually seeing here is the crystal structure of ice,

117
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.040
which is fundamentally driven by them, the molecules within it.

118
00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:17.770
And you're seeing different aspects of that molar molecular structure and how it

119
00:05:17.771 --> 00:05:20.080
forms different crystals, making these different colors arcs.

120
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.360
<v 2>Can you ever get the cylinder one without the hexagon one? I think.</v>

121
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.250
<v 0>Likely because the flat things tend to fall more commonly than the cylindrical</v>

122
00:05:29.251 --> 00:05:31.650
thing. So in order to get a decent number of cylindrical things,

123
00:05:31.651 --> 00:05:34.530
there's probably an awful lot of land things around this whole thing about

124
00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:38.580
crystal growth and why different crystals form in different circumstances is

125
00:05:38.581 --> 00:05:39.840
really not that well understood.

126
00:05:39.841 --> 00:05:43.080
And there are more complicated structures that ice can form. For example,

127
00:05:43.081 --> 00:05:45.270
it can form a little pyramid or crystal sometimes as well,

128
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.310
which produce a whole nother set of rocks, but they are very,

129
00:05:47.311 --> 00:05:50.610
very rare and the reasons why different arcs form in different circumstances,

130
00:05:50.611 --> 00:05:53.640
it's something to do with the properties within the cloud,

131
00:05:53.641 --> 00:05:57.200
where it's forming the exact state of the humidity and the temperature and all

132
00:05:57.201 --> 00:06:00.020
those kinds of things as to what kind of crystals form. Um,

133
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.050
but it's really clearly quite subtle what it is that ends up for me.

134
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.230
<v 2>So I saw something reasonably special.</v>

135
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.750
<v 0>The bright one is fairly common,</v>

136
00:06:07.751 --> 00:06:10.510
but not that often seen because people just don't look up often enough,

137
00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.240
but this one, the super lateral art really is a pretty rare phenomenon.

138
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.330
<v 2>All right. I feel like I've explored enough.</v>

139
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:17.620
<v 0>A bit of a lightweight though,</v>

140
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.100
because there are actually rather more spectacular arcs that get seen sometimes

141
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.941
just before Christmas,

142
00:06:21.941 --> 00:06:25.480
this came out on the astronomy picture of the day website of a set of arcs that

143
00:06:25.481 --> 00:06:28.330
somebody had seen. So your arcs are actually these two at the top.

144
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.700
So there's your circumstance at the lock and there's your super.

145
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.560
<v 2>Paradox. I prefer to call them.</v>

146
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.400
<v 0>I think they're reasonably, you know, well known at this point.</v>

147
00:06:36.401 --> 00:06:37.990
So I don't think that you get to call them after you,

148
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.310
but there's a whole bunch of different arcs due to different crystal structures,

149
00:06:42.311 --> 00:06:44.890
different orientations that can occur this one.

150
00:06:44.891 --> 00:06:48.940
It's a little bit of a fudge because the reason why the arcs is so spectacular

151
00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:52.000
here is it turns out that just that wind from where this photograph was being

152
00:06:52.001 --> 00:06:54.160
taken, they were making snow for a ski resort,

153
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.730
which was throwing out lots and lots and lots of ice crystals,

154
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.760
which clearly had just got carried off in the atmosphere to create this

155
00:07:00.761 --> 00:07:03.040
spectacular display. But there are actually arcs here,

156
00:07:03.041 --> 00:07:06.520
which have never been seen before. So there's a whole new array of arcs,

157
00:07:06.521 --> 00:07:09.460
which people are now trying to understand. So I got quite interested in this,

158
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.330
on the back of your photo and started nosing around,

159
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.080
turns out there's a really cool piece of software.

160
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:18.460
That's free to download and play with thing called halo SIM that lets you figure

161
00:07:18.461 --> 00:07:19.780
out what the different arcs are.

162
00:07:19.781 --> 00:07:23.320
So you can actually set up different crystals in different orientations.

163
00:07:23.321 --> 00:07:26.500
You can move the sun around and see what kind of arcs you can make.

164
00:07:26.501 --> 00:07:27.251
And you can see that actually,

165
00:07:27.251 --> 00:07:30.010
a lot of the things I just showed in that picture are here in that arc.

166
00:07:30.011 --> 00:07:31.120
So here are your ox again,

167
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.730
and here are a whole bunch of the arcs related to the ones that were in that

168
00:07:33.731 --> 00:07:36.550
other photo. Is it free software, free software free to download?

169
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:37.510
<v 2>Oh, okay.</v>

170
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.930
I want to play temperature that the air that should be with the sun where it is.

171
00:07:40.931 --> 00:07:41.380
And yeah.

172
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.580
<v 0>Absolutely. That's exactly in fact,</v>

173
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.650
interest in eight is about the temperature of the moon.

174
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.650
The average temperature of the moon is about minus 18 minus 20 centigrade

175
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.900
because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere.

176
00:07:49.901 --> 00:07:52.030
And so that really is the end of the story. As far as the body,

177
00:07:52.031 --> 00:07:52.960
like the moon is concerned.
