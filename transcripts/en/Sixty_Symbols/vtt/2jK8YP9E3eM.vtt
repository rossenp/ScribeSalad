1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.790
<v 0>I can talk about a failed supernova explosion,</v>

2
00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:07.110
which has resulted in a weird white dwarf heading out into the depths of it.

3
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.780
Okay. So a paper came out on the 20th.

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.570
<v 2>Um, so relatively recently, here it is SDSs.</v>

5
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.210
<v 0>And then the long telephone number that tells you what the star is,</v>

6
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.510
the partially burned remnant of a low mass white Wolf.

7
00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:26.000
That underwent thermonuclear ignition question Mark.

8
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.430
So I think we need to back up a little bit and talk about,

9
00:00:28.431 --> 00:00:30.830
so this is a white door star, uh,

10
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.590
and it's associated with a particular type of supernova,

11
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.240
a thing called a type one, a supernova, very famous type of supernova,

12
00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:41.450
because it's used as a standard candle. Something which the same brightness,

13
00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:42.230
wherever you see it.

14
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.380
So it's used for cosmology where we can actually use it and figure out how far

15
00:00:45.381 --> 00:00:47.090
things are away from how bright it appears.

16
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.170
The reason why it's a standard candle is because of the mode,

17
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.820
the way in which it explodes.

18
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.400
And essentially what happens is you have a white dwarf,

19
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.890
which is a very compact star.

20
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.690
It's held up only by the pressure of quantum mechanics effectively. The,

21
00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:04.040
always the question where the star is,

22
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.200
why it doesn't just collapse under its own gravity.

23
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.490
When it's burning nuclear processes in its core that provides the energy source

24
00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:11.324
that keeps it up.

25
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.200
But at the end of its life that goes away and the star will collapse.

26
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.370
And so for example,

27
00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:19.340
for a white dwarf it'll collapse right down to something about the size of the

28
00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:20.810
earth at that point,

29
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:25.160
these weird quantum mechanical effects kick in and stop it collapsing any

30
00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:25.970
further.

31
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.230
But what can then happen is there is a maximum mass for which that effect will

32
00:01:30.231 --> 00:01:32.150
work thing called the Chandrasekhar mass.

33
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.110
And if you keep adding in some way more and more mass to the star,

34
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.240
eventually you're going to approach that mass.

35
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.230
And there's a danger that the thing will collapse further and actually all sorts

36
00:01:42.231 --> 00:01:46.070
of turmoil occur within the white Thor star. It'll become very convective.

37
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.810
It'll become very disturbed inside.

38
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.910
That's the point at which white dwarf is in danger of actually exploding by

39
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.050
firing off a whole bunch of new nuclear thermonuclear processes,

40
00:01:57.051 --> 00:02:00.740
but in a very uncontrolled way. And so it will essentially explode.

41
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.393
<v 1>Interestingly.</v>

42
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.840
<v 0>The views on this have changed.</v>

43
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.470
It used to be thought that when a star tipped over that magical Chandrasekhar

44
00:02:09.471 --> 00:02:09.741
mass,

45
00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:13.820
that was the point at which you blew up as a supernova is now thought it never

46
00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:17.060
quite gets to that mass, but as it approaches that mass, as I say,

47
00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:19.280
it becomes very disturbed, stirs up,

48
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.450
very energetic processes can start happening and something then kicks off these

49
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.640
nuclear explosions within it. So then the question is, what will,

50
00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:30.200
why would a star be putting on weight? Why where's its extra mass coming from?

51
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.960
And in order for that to happen,

52
00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:36.950
there has to be another star nearby to kind of donate the extra mass.

53
00:02:36.951 --> 00:02:40.160
And so it's probably in systems where there's a binary, you've got two SIS,

54
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.690
two stars orbiting each other,

55
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.980
and one of them is donating some of its mass to the white Wolf.

56
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.540
And so eventually it reaches to this point where these runaway nuclear processes

57
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.890
occur and it explodes.

58
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.440
<v 2>So sort of skimming matter from its next door neighbor.</v>

59
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.310
<v 0>Efficiently close to it. It's actually ripping the mass off. It it's, you know,</v>

60
00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:00.610
it's it's of gravity becomes stronger than,

61
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.150
than the pull of gravity in the star that was holding onto that matter to start

62
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:06.970
with. So it's literally ripping off the outer layers of its,

63
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.120
of its neighboring store and acquiring them for itself.

64
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.140
Usually that process is thought to be sufficiently disruptive that there's

65
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:18.670
nothing left at the end, that the star just literally blows itself to bits. Um,

66
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.590
the interesting case here is that here there is still a white dwarf left, um,

67
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.530
but it has some weird properties and in particular,

68
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.120
when they studied the spectra of it.

69
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:31.600
So when they split the light up into the colors of the rainbow and looked at the

70
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:34.210
sort of signature of the different, different chemical elements,

71
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.530
they found some of those heavier elements that are made in the supernova

72
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:39.190
explosions.

73
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.420
So it looks like some sort of thermonuclear processes occurred with this white

74
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.140
off,

75
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.620
but it clearly hasn't been quite as destructive as it usually is because there's

76
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:49.060
still a white Wolf left at the end.

77
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.570
And the other interesting thing is that the nuclear processes haven't gone all

78
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:55.420
the way to the sort of end state that they usually do.

79
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.610
Usually we're not producing. You know, so the,

80
00:03:58.611 --> 00:04:02.920
the carbon in the white dwarf ends up producing Silicon and Silicon turns into

81
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.510
Nicole and the nickel turns into wire.

82
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.980
There's a whole series of nuclear reactions that go on and those produce all the

83
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:10.090
elements up to iron.

84
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.860
The interesting thing about this white dwarf is it doesn't have those heaviest

85
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:17.260
elements in it. It doesn't have iron in it, it doesn't have nickel in it.

86
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.680
So it looks like the process was sort of incomplete.

87
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.460
It didn't destroy the star and it didn't go through all the nuclear reactions

88
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:27.850
that these things usually go through. So it's like a failed supernova.

89
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.450
It didn't quite fail. Clearly something pretty dramatic happened to it,

90
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.480
but it didn't quite go all the way. So it sort of, yeah,

91
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.110
it didn't quite detonate completely. It was an incomplete detonation.

92
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.740
The other interesting thing about it is particular star is they can measure its

93
00:04:41.741 --> 00:04:42.520
speed.

94
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.340
You can measure the Doppler shift to tell you it's speed along the line of

95
00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:48.430
sight, but actually there are also proper motion measurements for it.

96
00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:51.610
They're also measurements of it's it's changing position on the sky,

97
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.340
so they know how fast it's going and it's actually,

98
00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:55.690
it's going round the wrong way.

99
00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:59.050
It's not orbiting around the Milky way in the same direction as most stars are.

100
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.860
And on top of that, it's going at about 200 kilometers per second.

101
00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:06.610
So it's click it's going along at a pretty rapid rate,

102
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.010
which suggests that whatever the explosion process was gave it a pretty

103
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:14.230
big kick. So it's now traveling a high speed.

104
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.120
This again is a sign of something to do with probably the fact that it was in a

105
00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:21.970
binary system to start with. It'd be nice to think that, you know,

106
00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:24.580
it was just some failed explosion that kicked it enormously,

107
00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:27.970
but it turns out that that probably isn't enough to give it the speed that we

108
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:29.890
see, but what is enough to give it?

109
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.210
The speed we see is if it was in a binary system and the explosion was

110
00:05:34.211 --> 00:05:36.280
sufficient to unbind the binary so that the,

111
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.400
the two binary stars were no longer bound to each other. Because if,

112
00:05:39.401 --> 00:05:42.100
for example, this was a white dwarf that was orbiting another white dwarf.

113
00:05:42.101 --> 00:05:43.300
They can get very close together,

114
00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:45.940
which means they're actually traveling around each other at hundreds of

115
00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:46.774
kilometers per second.

116
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.810
And so if you then suddenly take one of these whiteboards away,

117
00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:52.840
the remaining one will then just keep traveling at that several hundred

118
00:05:52.841 --> 00:05:56.710
kilometers per second. So it looks like it was probably in a very tight binary,

119
00:05:56.711 --> 00:05:58.490
probably with another white dwarf store.

120
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.590
This incomplete explosion occurred because it ripped enough of the material

121
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:06.500
from the other white dwarf to create a partial explosion.

122
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.430
And that disrupted the second star pop almost completely.

123
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:14.090
And so this first shot out, uh, into the Milky way.

124
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.300
<v 3>But the one that's shot out is the one that underwent the supernova of sorts.</v>

125
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.080
Yes.

126
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.910
<v 0>Yeah. The other one was probably,</v>

127
00:06:21.911 --> 00:06:24.820
it might've been destroyed completely in the explosion just because it got

128
00:06:24.821 --> 00:06:27.010
caught in the blast or it might, it might still exist.

129
00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:30.550
It might itself would also be flying off in some other direction. Um,

130
00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.140
there's really no way of telling.

131
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.870
<v 3>So we haven't, we don't know where the, the other,</v>

132
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.420
the brother is no clue at all.

133
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.650
So the one that's firing off that we do know about the one that's firing off

134
00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:43.450
into the depths of space.

135
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:48.310
It's not just the recoil from the explosion it's to do with the kind of

136
00:06:48.311 --> 00:06:51.370
uncoupling from the gravitational interaction.

137
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.451
<v 0>Exactly.</v>

138
00:06:52.451 --> 00:06:55.180
It's almost certainly to do with the fact that you're what we're most of the

139
00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:58.390
speed we're seeing is the speed that it originally had in its binary system,

140
00:06:58.391 --> 00:07:00.970
but suddenly that binary doesn't exist as a binary anymore.

141
00:07:00.971 --> 00:07:02.470
So it's just flying out into space.

142
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.860
So there's a couple of interesting implications of this one is that this type of

143
00:07:05.861 --> 00:07:06.431
explosion.

144
00:07:06.431 --> 00:07:10.450
So the reason why we typically see supernovae isn't because of the original

145
00:07:10.451 --> 00:07:14.890
explosion it's because those explosions produce lots of radioactive material,

146
00:07:14.891 --> 00:07:18.130
which then subsequently decays. And over the weeks and months that follow,

147
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.660
we see the energy that's being released from those nuclear decay products,

148
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:27.640
the main nuclear decay product in type one, a supernovae is nickel.

149
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.120
And of course this one never got round to making any nickel.

150
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.900
So it wouldn't have had any material to go through this decay process,

151
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.850
which means that if we had been around,

152
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.790
but the supernova almost certainly worked,

153
00:07:39.791 --> 00:07:43.600
it would have been in the very distant past. But if such supernovae do go off,

154
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.050
you probably wouldn't see them because unless you happen to be looking at just

155
00:07:47.051 --> 00:07:50.110
the right moment, when the flash occurred, then you wouldn't see it.

156
00:07:50.111 --> 00:07:53.440
And then there isn't that then slow subsequent decay that would allow you to

157
00:07:53.441 --> 00:07:58.270
catch the explosion later on the second sort of slight warning

158
00:07:58.271 --> 00:08:02.290
here is this, you know, that the simple story we usually tell about type one,

159
00:08:02.291 --> 00:08:04.660
a supernovae is they're all the same and it's very straightforward.

160
00:08:04.661 --> 00:08:06.520
And that's why we can use them as standard candles.

161
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.060
There is at least a little bit of a warning here that says actually sometimes

162
00:08:10.061 --> 00:08:13.660
weird things happen and you get incomplete explosions or different kinds of

163
00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:14.494
explosions.

164
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.410
So it doesn't mean we have to be a little careful if we're going to be using

165
00:08:17.411 --> 00:08:19.240
type one, a supernova, your standard candles.

166
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:21.700
<v 3>You refer to this remnant,</v>

167
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.570
that's barreling through the Milky way as a star.

168
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.430
Is it still acting like a star? Is it,

169
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.100
is it undergoing nuclear processes and emitting light? And yeah.

170
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.640
<v 0>I mean, it's still emitting light because it's still hot, but it's, uh, it is,</v>

171
00:08:33.641 --> 00:08:37.270
it's still a white door star. So it's still held up by its degeneracy pressure.

172
00:08:37.271 --> 00:08:39.910
It's not got any new nuclear processes going on, indeed.

173
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.790
So it's a question where do you count white doors or stars or not?

174
00:08:42.791 --> 00:08:45.160
If you think of white doors to start, and this thing is still a star,

175
00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:47.680
if you think it's just the remnant of a store, then I guess at this point,

176
00:08:47.681 --> 00:08:48.820
it's just the remnant of a star.

177
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:52.450
<v 3>Mike, if this is a common process and this happens a lot,</v>

178
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.760
would we have seen them before now? Like,

179
00:08:54.761 --> 00:08:58.050
should we this an oddity or is it possible? These things are everywhere.

180
00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:02.180
<v 0>I mean, they are relatively faint. So maybe we don't find, you know,</v>

181
00:09:02.181 --> 00:09:04.010
we don't find all of them necessarily.

182
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.190
And maybe we haven't studied all stars in sufficient detail.

183
00:09:07.191 --> 00:09:10.370
But I think what this is probably telling us is this,

184
00:09:10.371 --> 00:09:13.850
this is a kind of a rare process. And if the story I've told you is right,

185
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.020
that it originated in a pair of white doors that were sufficiently close to each

186
00:09:18.021 --> 00:09:20.360
other. That one was actually ripping material from the other.

187
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:24.290
And at some 0.1 of them underwent our kind of slightly failed explosion.

188
00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.990
It's probably a fairly unlikely scenario.

189
00:09:26.991 --> 00:09:29.330
So I suspect there's probably not a huge number of them out there,

190
00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:30.680
but we really don't know at this point.

191
00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.910
<v 3>Sounds quite exciting though. Doesn't it the idea of this, of a white dwarf,</v>

192
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:38.030
like, you know, barreling through the Milky way,

193
00:09:38.031 --> 00:09:40.310
like this sort of Cannonball run.

194
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.370
<v 0>And sort of running from the scene of the crime as well, actually, you're right.</v>

195
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.530
It's clearly, you know, that it's just survived.

196
00:09:45.531 --> 00:09:48.340
This massive explosion is now heading off as fast as it can.

197
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.830
<v 3>Did this finding excite you like to do these things still surprising?</v>

198
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.310
<v 0>Absolutely. In fact, so, you know, so in fact, you told me about this paper.</v>

199
00:09:55.311 --> 00:09:56.270
I didn't know about this paper,

200
00:09:56.271 --> 00:09:59.780
unless you pointed me towards a newspaper article about it, uh,

201
00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.780
which got me to read the paper. Uh, it's not why, you know,

202
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.600
I usually do galaxies. I don't do white doors and supernovae and things,

203
00:10:05.601 --> 00:10:08.990
but the more I read about in the paper, the more interested I got in it,

204
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.970
because it's clear, this is a very intriguing object.

205
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:13.760
<v 3>Mm mm.</v>

206
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:19.310
<v 4>Star clusters or if they were galaxies and if there are galaxies,</v>

207
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:20.241
then that's something really,

208
00:10:20.241 --> 00:10:24.830
really interesting because it's not clear how such a

209
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.270
dense galaxy could form, which is really, really quite nice.

210
00:10:29.271 --> 00:10:30.890
It's not a very impressive image,

211
00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.010
but this is the first image that new horizons took before.

212
00:10:34.011 --> 00:10:38.390
It went on to take images of Jupiter when it flew past Jupiter and then images

213
00:10:38.391 --> 00:10:42.830
of Pluto and now even images of an asteroid in the Kuiper belt as well.
