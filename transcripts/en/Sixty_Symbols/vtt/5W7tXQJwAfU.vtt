1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.050
<v 0>You guys rolling? Destiny's rolling. Yep. And if you want me,</v>

2
00:00:04.051 --> 00:00:08.610
I'll do another slap of their hand. So the video and audio are synced up.

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.560
I, um, in house, in knotting them.

4
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.630
So I'm like everybody else locked down and I'm having a fun

5
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:22.470
time being socially distanced. Let's put it that way.

6
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.020
Yeah. How about you, Brittany?

7
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.010
<v 1>I am. I'm the same. I'm locked in a room editing videos,</v>

8
00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:29.540
but that's what I normally do anyway.

9
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.370
<v 0>Yeah. I'm getting a lot of writing done. So it's, it's not so bad. You know,</v>

10
00:00:34.371 --> 00:00:38.960
obviously a lot of people are, you know, suffering in terms of,

11
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.000
you know, family members, et cetera, have got to admit my family's okay.

12
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.380
Um, even my more elderly relatives are all care. So, you know,

13
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:52.700
it could be a lot worse. I'm getting some writing done. I'm getting some,

14
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.410
you know, the usual standard, my inboxes just as full,

15
00:00:57.411 --> 00:01:00.620
if not more full than it used to be. So, um,

16
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.970
in some ways this is, you know, surreal in other way.

17
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.770
Whereas it's almost business as usual.

18
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.660
<v 1>I feel a lot of scientists and mathematicians I spoke to when the lockdown</v>

19
00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:12.830
status said, this is great.

20
00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:16.190
I can catch up on lots of writing and papers that I've been sitting in a drawer

21
00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:17.420
for months,

22
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.870
but then they've been telling me I've been stuck on so many zoom calls and

23
00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:24.170
meetings and other administrative things that take lots of time.

24
00:01:24.171 --> 00:01:27.290
I'm getting even less work than done them before on the writing side.

25
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.740
<v 0>That's, that's a good point. Brady. That's how it is. That's really our, I feel,</v>

26
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.670
um, and it's not just, it's not just the zoom calls and that, that,

27
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.820
that side of things, it's the, something about the,

28
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.330
that the atmosphere and the environment and the Le the lack of structure

29
00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:45.800
sometimes to the dare. That certainly I feel my, my productivity has gone down,

30
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:48.920
but, you know, productivity, isn't everything, as I say, you know,

31
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.630
healthy and well. So I've got to count blessings as it were. Um,

32
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.950
and the other thing, as well,

33
00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:59.180
as I'm sort of glad I don't spend as much time on social media as I used to,

34
00:01:59.181 --> 00:02:03.110
because I'm sure I'd get very sick of people going look at this thing. I made,

35
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.590
look at this thing. I cooked and look at this thing I painted on.

36
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.370
Look at I've solved all the world's problems in German lockdown that could get

37
00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:12.680
very infuriate. And after a little while, I think.

38
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.251
<v 1>Well,</v>

39
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:17.810
how did the timing of the lockdown come for you in terms of what was happening

40
00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:21.950
in your labs? Like where you were, you were on the brink of a great discovery.

41
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.370
Was it a good time for the lab to have to close down anyway, or.

42
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.580
<v 0>No? No, it's never a good time for the lab to close down.</v>

43
00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:32.180
I was actually on research leave at the university of Alberta.

44
00:02:32.181 --> 00:02:35.630
I was in Canada with Bob [inaudible] lab when,

45
00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:38.450
when the whole sort of lockdown started.

46
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.880
And I had to cut that research,

47
00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:45.440
leave short and come back instead of spending two weeks in Edmonton university

48
00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:50.210
of Alberta, I had to come back a week early. Um, so,

49
00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:52.610
and then the labs are completely shut down.

50
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.070
The pumps aren't even running on the vacuum system.

51
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.910
So we'll be doing a lot of backing when we go back after the lockdown.

52
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.250
Can you just explain.

53
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.560
<v 1>What do you mean by you'll have to do a lot of baking. I thought,</v>

54
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.230
I thought everyone was doing their baking now while they're stuck at home.

55
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.680
<v 0>Yeah. So for us, um, to get a very, very good vacuum,</v>

56
00:03:10.681 --> 00:03:15.420
we have to heat the entire ultra high vacuum system up to 150

57
00:03:15.421 --> 00:03:18.300
degrees. And we call that process baking.

58
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.480
And after there's going to be prolonged period,

59
00:03:21.481 --> 00:03:24.990
when the systems will be not pumped throughout a static,

60
00:03:24.991 --> 00:03:28.650
what we'd call a static vacuum. So they're sitting there in principle,

61
00:03:28.651 --> 00:03:30.900
the vacuum should be key ish,

62
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.680
but there certainly need to be bags to get back to the levels of vacuum that we

63
00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:38.280
really, really need to start to experiment the program again, when that happens,

64
00:03:38.281 --> 00:03:40.380
I don't know, nobody knows.

65
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.600
<v 1>Purely from a science perspective, how catastrophic is this for science?</v>

66
00:03:45.601 --> 00:03:49.890
I know a lot of industries. This is like, this is killing a lot of industries.

67
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.920
Is science a bit more resilient to this kind of shutdown?

68
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.660
<v 0>This is obviously going to hold science for quite some time, you know,</v>

69
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.080
experiment, experiment list. Um, we can do some work,

70
00:04:01.081 --> 00:04:04.230
obviously in terms of computer simulations, we're working with machine learning,

71
00:04:04.231 --> 00:04:07.650
so that can happen offline, but in terms of experiments,

72
00:04:07.651 --> 00:04:12.630
no experiments are happening at the moment for experimental post-docs and for

73
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.770
experimental researchers. That's a, that's a real issue. And, um,

74
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.570
hopefully in order,

75
00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:22.050
we're going to be able to get back in the lab and hopefully it will be in terms

76
00:04:22.051 --> 00:04:24.030
of when university research starts up again,

77
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.600
I would very much hope it will be the experimentalists to we'll be getting back,

78
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.410
you know, allowed back on campus. Um, first,

79
00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:34.440
because they are the ones that are really suffering from, you know,

80
00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:39.120
not being able to have access to the science they can do. We do a lot of sales.

81
00:04:39.121 --> 00:04:40.950
I see a lot of simulations. We launched machine learning,

82
00:04:40.951 --> 00:04:45.750
so that can happen offline and that can happen away from the campus.

83
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:46.800
But, um,

84
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.100
the core of what we do is basically just entirely shut down at the moment.

85
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.210
<v 1>Phil, a lot of industries have been able to keep working as long as they're very</v>

86
00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:58.410
careful about how they locate their people is the reason you've had to shut your

87
00:04:58.411 --> 00:05:01.860
lab because of a university directive to stay off campus.

88
00:05:01.861 --> 00:05:04.740
Or did you think your lab couldn't work specifically?

89
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.120
<v 0>It's a university directive, it's a school directive. We were off campus.</v>

90
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.010
I will see how that goes over the next few weeks in terms of our stairs sort of

91
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.800
reintroduction or a staged allowance and getting people back into the lab. Um,

92
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.360
in early lab,

93
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:26.310
I think we could have a mechanism whereby we'd ensure that there

94
00:05:26.311 --> 00:05:26.851
were, you know,

95
00:05:26.851 --> 00:05:30.720
just one person in the lab and we could have shifts and people could come in and

96
00:05:30.721 --> 00:05:35.670
social distancing could still be, um, you know, going on. Um,

97
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.790
the problem is though, of course, is when that's not just our lab,

98
00:05:38.791 --> 00:05:42.480
when it's every lab in the, in the department, on every lab in the university,

99
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.480
then I can understand the university's concerns.

100
00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:48.540
Then it becomes a lot more difficult to manage. Could our lab continue?

101
00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:51.360
Absolutely. But, um, we're not the only lab there.

102
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:52.171
<v 1>I feel.</v>

103
00:05:52.171 --> 00:05:55.770
I know recently you've been having a big role at the university with admissions

104
00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:56.880
of new students.

105
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.790
And that seems to be something that has been on your mind a bit about how this

106
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:05.570
shutdown is affecting student intake, the new students, current students.

107
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:08.470
Can you tell me about where your concerns have been and how,

108
00:06:08.471 --> 00:06:10.040
how they've been resolving in your head?

109
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.420
<v 0>I was under, as you say, I was undergraduate admissions Judah,</v>

110
00:06:13.421 --> 00:06:15.670
which means that I oversaw, um,

111
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.060
applications from high school students from secondary school students,

112
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.140
air level students, AP physics, students, et cetera, et cetera. Um,

113
00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.210
uh, in, into our courses, uh, did that for five years. Last year,

114
00:06:28.211 --> 00:06:31.210
I passed that role over to my colleague, Megan Gray,

115
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.050
many of you and 60 cymbal to know Mike and very well and deep sky videos would

116
00:06:35.051 --> 00:06:39.010
know Megan very well. Megan and I obviously have the same concerns,

117
00:06:39.011 --> 00:06:43.870
but what we are would want to just want to get the message

118
00:06:43.871 --> 00:06:47.200
out there to those students who are obviously going to be worried. They haven't,

119
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.590
they won't be doing the exams like previous students have.

120
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.390
They might be a little bit worried about, um, uh, just how,

121
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.790
what it's going to be like the first year at university.

122
00:06:57.791 --> 00:07:01.840
And of course we don't want you to panic. We don't want you to worry.

123
00:07:01.841 --> 00:07:03.550
We are well aware that,

124
00:07:03.551 --> 00:07:08.200
of course this is a completely different unprecedented situation,

125
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:13.030
surreal in many ways. And we of course, are going to make, um, you know,

126
00:07:13.031 --> 00:07:14.380
make sure that we take a counter.

127
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:17.350
<v 1>It feels like there are two issues here.</v>

128
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:22.360
One is how you're going to decide which students get admitted if they haven't

129
00:07:22.361 --> 00:07:24.340
taken the normal exams.

130
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.850
And the second issue is for the ones that you do take in,

131
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.450
what is their level of preparedness going to be in terms of, you know,

132
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.960
their underlying mathematical and physics ability,

133
00:07:34.961 --> 00:07:39.220
because like missed the last part of their final year of scope. First of all,

134
00:07:39.221 --> 00:07:41.530
in terms of how you decide who to admit,

135
00:07:41.531 --> 00:07:43.300
do you even know how that's going to be done yet?

136
00:07:43.301 --> 00:07:45.100
Or is that being decided by other powers? Or.

137
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.970
<v 0>We have some idea that's obviously going to be discarded cited by,</v>

138
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.400
by government overall department of education. Overall,

139
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.300
it will be on a levels are not going ahead in the UK.

140
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.740
Even GCSE exams are not going ahead.

141
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:00.910
So we,

142
00:08:00.911 --> 00:08:03.910
it will have to be on the basis of predicted grades that will have to be on the

143
00:08:03.911 --> 00:08:08.590
basis of, of whatever coursework is available to help teachers make decisions,

144
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:09.610
et cetera.

145
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.850
And we are just going to have to take those predicted grads on board and make

146
00:08:12.851 --> 00:08:16.360
our decisions on the basis of those, those grades. Um,

147
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:20.470
Megan can tell you a lot more about this. I must admit I am not,

148
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:24.760
I do not envy a tall Megan's situation at the moment in terms of being an

149
00:08:24.761 --> 00:08:28.930
admissions tutor during this particular period. Um, but as I said, that's,

150
00:08:28.931 --> 00:08:31.450
that's largely what we're going to have to do. Um,

151
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.620
with regard to preparedness might the key message I want to get across is don't

152
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:39.910
panic and the best Douglas Adams Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy where do not

153
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.240
panic. We are well aware that these are unprecedented circumstances.

154
00:08:43.241 --> 00:08:46.300
We are well aware that students are going to be really anxious and nervous in

155
00:08:46.301 --> 00:08:48.550
terms of what I haven't done, the exams.

156
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.850
I haven't had the same preparation as other years of how we know that.

157
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.820
And I'm just thought it would be a good idea to, you know,

158
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.680
suggest a few things just to keep the brands taken over in terms of lockdown.

159
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:03.960
So everybody doesn't go stir crazy.

160
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:07.260
Everybody doesn't start crawling the walls in terms of what physics you could

161
00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:09.360
do, the type of things that we might recommend.

162
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.080
<v 1>I hope this, I hope you're gonna recommend 60 symbols fail.</v>

163
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.740
<v 0>Absolutely. The first on my list is of course,</v>

164
00:09:15.741 --> 00:09:19.370
60 symbols on all those other wonderful Brady higher-end channels,

165
00:09:19.371 --> 00:09:22.970
including number file, and deep sky videos and periodic videos,

166
00:09:22.971 --> 00:09:25.700
even though it causes me great pain after mentioned the chemists,

167
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:30.620
but there we go. Um, yeah, so definitely there are all those wonderful,

168
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:32.930
uh, online resources. There are,

169
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.640
there are other videos on physics that you can find other than Brady's.

170
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.820
<v 1>Uh, the channels, all the channels are available. Exactly.</v>

171
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:42.860
<v 0>I may. Well, if it's okay with you Brady,</v>

172
00:09:42.861 --> 00:09:47.060
I'm going to write up a short blog post on this and I'll just put a range of

173
00:09:47.061 --> 00:09:52.040
different links in there. I guess the first thing to say as a sort of,

174
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.960
you know, keep on, keep on doing what you like about physics, you know,

175
00:09:56.961 --> 00:10:00.950
keep out and, you know, watching those videos, but also reading Alec.

176
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.470
I can certainly recommend a whole host of different books.

177
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.440
There are a couple of websites I'd really like to recommend though.

178
00:10:06.441 --> 00:10:09.500
First of all, there's something called, um, ICIC physics.

179
00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:14.840
AIESEC has an Isaac Newton, which is a university of Cambridge based, uh,

180
00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.720
online project funded, funded by the Ogden trust,

181
00:10:17.721 --> 00:10:22.130
which has also actually funded 60 symbols in the past. And, um,

182
00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:26.000
that's a really great resource for, um,

183
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:30.290
preparing both on a level, but also in a university level.

184
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:34.310
So if you want to get an idea or you want to get some, um, uh,

185
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:39.260
physics problems and thinking about just where the Le the level is going to be,

186
00:10:39.261 --> 00:10:43.190
when you enter university, it's really well worth taking a look at ice expense,

187
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.480
it's also quite fun. The Institute of physics also has a really great site,

188
00:10:47.481 --> 00:10:52.400
which is called spark.iop.org in terms of what else can you

189
00:10:52.401 --> 00:10:56.030
do beyond online resources and breeding? Of course,

190
00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:01.250
one thing I would suggest really heavily suggest for those of you who are into

191
00:11:01.251 --> 00:11:02.300
coding cold.

192
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.860
And for those of you who aren't into coding star coding,

193
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:12.140
honestly, you will find it's great fun. It can be infuriating at times,

194
00:11:12.141 --> 00:11:16.970
but in terms of really focusing you in terms of

195
00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:22.190
learning real physics and how to code that physics and to

196
00:11:22.191 --> 00:11:23.750
write a physics simulation,

197
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.190
that's really good preparation for any university degree. And moreover,

198
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.550
it's really good in terms of understanding the core,

199
00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.330
the core physics as an undergraduate. Um, I,

200
00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:39.290
and I've said this before in other videos, Brady, but it's worth repeating.

201
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:42.590
My mantra was if I can't code it,

202
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.640
I don't understand it because for coding a simulation,

203
00:11:46.641 --> 00:11:50.720
according a piece of physics really focuses you down on what are the core

204
00:11:50.721 --> 00:11:55.030
aspects here. It's a whole wide range of different projects I could suggest. Um,

205
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.620
and even sort of those, the, the mathematical side, where from the physics,

206
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:01.210
the things like the Mandelbrot set,

207
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.540
this things like the cube roots of unity fractals,

208
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.320
there's a whole wide range of really fun projects you could do that will keep

209
00:12:08.321 --> 00:12:12.430
your math skills, um, up to, up to, to grid as well.

210
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.550
<v 1>Just reading between the lines there.</v>

211
00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:18.810
I feel like I feel that maybe you're even suggesting sometimes when students

212
00:12:18.811 --> 00:12:21.330
come through from school at the best of times,

213
00:12:21.331 --> 00:12:24.240
maybe they could turn up their coding a little bit.

214
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.470
<v 0>Yeah, absolutely. Um, so your math skills are important,</v>

215
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:32.370
but also it's increasingly important to, to,

216
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:34.380
to start getting into coding skills.

217
00:12:34.381 --> 00:12:36.660
And obviously computer five is a great place to start,

218
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.860
but as well as watching videos, it's like learning a musical instrument,

219
00:12:40.861 --> 00:12:44.490
particularly with coding, but also particularly with physics, you have to,

220
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:46.590
you know, it's practice and it's, it's,

221
00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:50.610
it's the difference between sort of passively watching a video and actively

222
00:12:50.611 --> 00:12:54.690
doing something and not actively doing something will really sort of embed these

223
00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:59.580
ideas. And I huge area, not just in physics,

224
00:12:59.581 --> 00:13:02.580
but in all of the sciences, right across the board,

225
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:06.600
out of science and economics in practically every areas of obviously machine

226
00:13:06.601 --> 00:13:08.550
learning and artificial intelligence.

227
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.200
And so much of physics is now that interface with,

228
00:13:13.201 --> 00:13:16.560
with computer science in terms of machine learning. And that's, you know,

229
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.100
there are quite a few sites out, down there, some grit, um,

230
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.280
computer five videos on neural nets and machine learning,

231
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.540
and thinking about how that translates into physics is, is also, um,

232
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.590
something very worthwhile to do. There's a great book by the way, actually,

233
00:13:31.591 --> 00:13:33.480
I've got it here. So there's this great book,

234
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:38.070
which is not so much about the details of the algorithms, et cetera, et cetera,

235
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.150
but it's a really good read in terms of machine learning and, um,

236
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.730
called reds inside the machine by a guy called Robert Smith,

237
00:13:44.731 --> 00:13:47.370
not the singer in the cure, the band, the cure,

238
00:13:47.371 --> 00:13:51.180
but actually a professor at UCL at university college, London. And that's,

239
00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:54.450
that's well worth the rate in terms of the broader scope of how many areas

240
00:13:54.451 --> 00:13:55.830
machine learning is feeding into.

241
00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.520
<v 1>Is there a particular language that one should pick up if one's going to just</v>

242
00:13:59.521 --> 00:14:02.370
start saying, okay, I'm going to learn to code w where did the,

243
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.230
so I thought there are a whole bunch of languages on there.

244
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.760
<v 0>Python is a good place to start frightens, open source. It's freely available.</v>

245
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.800
It's a really good place to start. Um,

246
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:15.210
but even I like I've started to get back into JavaScript quite a lot.

247
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.020
JavaScript is a lot of fun because you can embed simulations into a browser.

248
00:14:19.021 --> 00:14:19.621
And in fact,

249
00:14:19.621 --> 00:14:24.420
all you need for Java script is basically no pod on a browser.

250
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.960
That's really it. And then you can start coding that when it's a lot of fun,

251
00:14:27.961 --> 00:14:30.150
you can tweak, you can really set up an environment.

252
00:14:30.151 --> 00:14:35.040
You can have buttons and sliders and chance the parameters. And,

253
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.350
you know, there are things like the fusion,

254
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.530
there are sort of some standard standard projects,

255
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:45.180
which are still a lot of fun in terms of diffusion limited aggregation.

256
00:14:45.181 --> 00:14:49.830
The icing model does, you know, even things like the simple pendulum,

257
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:55.010
if you apply force to it, you can code that. And actually that would be here,

258
00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:00.060
chaotically, not randomly chaotically in the true physics sense, it's it, it's,

259
00:15:00.061 --> 00:15:04.010
it's, it's a really neat manifestation of chaos, that project alone,

260
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.680
that piece of code alone on a simple pendulum, a driven,

261
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:11.240
simple pendulum that can keep you going for Dez. You know, and in fact,

262
00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:12.230
that's, you know,

263
00:15:12.231 --> 00:15:16.880
that's often one of the projects that set at undergraduate level as well.

264
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.540
So, um, there's a range of different different projects.

265
00:15:20.541 --> 00:15:23.960
And what I'll do is I'll in the blog post I'll I'll I'll list. A few of these.

266
00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:28.390
<v 1>Fill the lockdown as we record now, hasn't been going for that long.</v>

267
00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.800
It's been a few weeks,

268
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:33.670
and I know most school students are still having interaction with their teachers

269
00:15:33.671 --> 00:15:36.460
via technology and, and home learning.

270
00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.120
I feel that how much can they be missing out on,

271
00:15:40.121 --> 00:15:44.260
in their last few weeks of school? And if it's been topped up by home learning,

272
00:15:44.261 --> 00:15:45.790
I mean, this can't be that big a problem.

273
00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.320
<v 0>Oh, no, it's quite it's, uh, it's, it's, uh, it's a pretty big problem. Well,</v>

274
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:53.890
first of all, the exams not happening is, is, um, a big problem.

275
00:15:53.891 --> 00:15:57.490
And so there's not that intense drive and there's not that intense motivation.

276
00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:01.990
Um, at this end of the school year for GCCS and air was my daughter's actually a

277
00:16:01.991 --> 00:16:04.600
GCSE. She would have been doing GCSE exams this year.

278
00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:06.970
And in terms of A-level students, it's exactly the same.

279
00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:09.400
There's not this same drive. They are doing homework.

280
00:16:09.401 --> 00:16:13.900
The teachers are doing an incredible job in keeping them motivated, et cetera.

281
00:16:13.901 --> 00:16:16.940
But with the best will in the world are not going to the classroom the day isn't

282
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.960
restructured. They, it's not the same environment.

283
00:16:19.961 --> 00:16:23.800
It's not the same sort of overall ethos. So,

284
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.750
and again,

285
00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:29.170
I am even finding it sometimes in terms of productivity and motivation, very,

286
00:16:29.171 --> 00:16:33.370
very difficult. So, you know, students are also going to find that in, in,

287
00:16:33.371 --> 00:16:37.990
under these circumstances. So, um, it is very different, I would say,

288
00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:39.363
compared to.

289
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.130
<v 1>And a lot of stuff gets crammed in. Does it in those,</v>

290
00:16:42.131 --> 00:16:45.640
in those last months and gets like solidified and you Brian, that is like,

291
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:46.540
that is a key time.

292
00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:49.210
<v 0>Yes, it is.</v>

293
00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.120
These last few months we're in the run up to exams are absolutely key.

294
00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.960
<v 1>When do, when you have to excuse my ignorance.</v>

295
00:16:55.990 --> 00:17:00.340
When would new students be starting? If everything like best case scenario,

296
00:17:00.341 --> 00:17:02.410
I know there's so much doubt around everything at the moment,

297
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.070
but best case scenario, when will the new students come in?

298
00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.850
<v 0>It, would it be that it's, that it's the second, last week of September for us,</v>

299
00:17:09.851 --> 00:17:12.940
it varies a little bit across the UK, but for Nottingham, it will be the second,

300
00:17:12.941 --> 00:17:15.760
last week in September would be the sort of induction week.

301
00:17:15.761 --> 00:17:19.120
And then lectures would start last week of September,

302
00:17:19.121 --> 00:17:20.530
right at the beginning of October,

303
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:26.080
whether we're going to hit that big, big uncertainty.

304
00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.490
<v 1>We'll get people on the case.</v>

305
00:17:27.491 --> 00:17:31.570
I will link to your blog and all the stuff that people can look at. Um,

306
00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.480
one last question then, while everyone's locked down,

307
00:17:34.481 --> 00:17:39.070
it's always a good chance to explore new music, any music recommendations?

308
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.770
<v 0>Oh, why? Why, why? Whoa, thank you for that opportunity.</v>

309
00:17:44.771 --> 00:17:47.320
So myself and a couple of friends, uh,

310
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:52.590
James on paid have been this game, which is recommend a new band or a new album.

311
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.080
Um, uh, every, uh, every day.

312
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.680
<v 1>I'm giving you 10 minutes. I'm giving you 10 minutes.</v>

313
00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.880
<v 0>Oh, this does a whole host. And you miss. You're one of my favorite new bands.</v>

314
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.230
There's a band called [inaudible] who managed to mix the most metal of metal

315
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:14.600
blast beats, et cetera, with folk music, basically. And, um,

316
00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.140
pink Floyd harmonies for anybody. Who's a fan of all path.

317
00:18:18.141 --> 00:18:21.710
I recommend welder on the Boston bond. Um,

318
00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:25.610
in terms of old albums, if you haven't heard of Kings X,

319
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:28.790
go out and get download, beg, borrow, steal,

320
00:18:28.791 --> 00:18:30.650
and out and called out of the silent planet.

321
00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:35.900
And it's the third recommendation jellyfish, absolute power pop band,

322
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:39.740
nineties, or huge debt to Lennon and McCartney. Um,

323
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.090
but then who doesn't,

324
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:45.800
but they do the Beatles better than the Beatles. Did the Beatles.

325
00:18:45.801 --> 00:18:47.780
You'll understand when you hear the albums club.

326
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:53.180
<v 1>All right. Thank you for that first. Thank you for thank you,</v>

327
00:18:53.181 --> 00:18:57.020
professor Moriarty, and, uh, for your words, words of wisdom.

328
00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.080
<v 0>Thank you, Brady. Thanks a lot. Good luck.</v>

329
00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:03.590
X-ray optics.

330
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:07.790
And we need to be able to get those x-rays onto our sample to focus some time.

331
00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:12.800
The synchrotron is about 10 billion times brighter than the sun.

332
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.980
So this is an immense engineer and challenge.
