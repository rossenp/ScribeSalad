1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.000
<v 0>Well, very ready knowing him, as you can see on a they've today announced the,</v>

2
00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:06.900
the Nobel prize for physics. So in a nutshell, it's it's concert,

3
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:08.880
black holes is the only way I could describe it.

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.250
<v 1>The wording of the citation is kind of interesting. So let me just read it out.</v>

5
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.920
It says the Nobel prize in physics 2020, it was divided one half audit.

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.830
Roger Penrose for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction

7
00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:23.330
of the general theory of relativity,

8
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.030
the other half jointly to Reinhardt Gainesville.

9
00:00:26.031 --> 00:00:30.200
And Andrea gets for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the center

10
00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:31.034
of our galaxy.

11
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.480
And you'll notice it sort of skates round saying anything there being about

12
00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:38.360
there being a massive black hole at the center of our galaxy,

13
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.580
because technically no one has really proved that that's what it is. It's just,

14
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:44.060
you know,

15
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.670
no one can think of anything else that it could possibly be at this point.

16
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.030
<v 0>So storm, is there going to be looking at the black hole sense of our galaxy,</v>

17
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.650
basically what they, they,

18
00:00:51.651 --> 00:00:54.830
they were looking at this managed to establish that there was a really compact

19
00:00:54.831 --> 00:00:59.060
object there, 4 million solar masses in basically a region,

20
00:00:59.061 --> 00:01:02.780
the size of our solar system, or even less, and, you know, the remarkable,

21
00:01:02.781 --> 00:01:04.040
astronomical observations.

22
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.850
But the guy I want to talk about is the other half of the prize,

23
00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:12.640
which is asked Roger Penrose, cause I'm a theorist and he's a theorist, um,

24
00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:14.990
and services. We share love interests, um,

25
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.020
and the work that he did and the reason that, uh,

26
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.720
Penrose got the prize and it was really,

27
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.000
he basically sort of lent taught something about the structure of protocols and

28
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:28.970
what lurks inside of and what lurks inside a black hole.

29
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.340
It's this dreaded singularity. This is this region of sort of, eh,

30
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.470
infinitely strong gravitational field, infinite space-time curvature,

31
00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:42.110
that horrible word, infinity that basically these,

32
00:01:42.111 --> 00:01:46.370
this horrible monster at the center of a black hole exists. So I would say it's,

33
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.821
you know,

34
00:01:46.821 --> 00:01:50.420
that 1965 pay for that remarkable pay for which showed that these singularities

35
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.730
offer real. I didn't really shut the world of physics.

36
00:01:52.731 --> 00:01:54.320
Everybody was stoned by it.

37
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.160
No one saw it because they thought these similarities were just, uh, an office,

38
00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.911
lots of symmetry.

39
00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:02.030
They didn't think they were real Henry shared that they were real general.

40
00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:04.920
Relativity, Germany really did predict them. And,

41
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.510
and then Hawking then took that on. And I worked at Penrose as well,

42
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:11.480
and they showed that you could get these similarities, you know, in a,

43
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.700
sort of at the big bang of the start of the universe,

44
00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:15.010
or maybe at the end of the university,

45
00:02:15.011 --> 00:02:17.840
it wasn't just inside black holes and the whole story sort of,

46
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.320
sort of blossomed into something. And, and the other thing it tells you,

47
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.890
these similarities tell you is that is the general relativity is not a complete

48
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:29.450
theory because it can't describe those singularities it's

49
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.000
outside, even though, even though predicts, they exist.

50
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.030
And Penrose showed us that, you know,

51
00:02:34.031 --> 00:02:35.930
you follow your nose and follow general relativity,

52
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:37.460
you're going to end up with this place with these strata.

53
00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:40.580
Singularities actually, it can't really describe it.

54
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.430
And that's why we know we need more than general relativity. We need, uh,

55
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.420
a quantum theory of gravity, whatever that might be string theory or whatever.

56
00:02:47.421 --> 00:02:51.050
So it also tells it also sort of spelled the demise of general relativity.

57
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.780
We know it's not the full story.

58
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.950
It's just one of the other wonderful things about what Penrose did.

59
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.800
This is a great piece of it because a fibrous piece of back, as I said,

60
00:02:57.801 --> 00:03:02.140
it's probably the most important, uh, paper in, in, in gravity,

61
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:05.860
between Einstein's original papers and his in 1965. But,

62
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:09.040
but you don't really see Nobel prizes in the past given for these kinds of

63
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.030
theory papers. Um, now no one's actually gone into a black hole,

64
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.910
has spotted a singularity that hasn't happened,

65
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.380
and yet they've given him this prize.

66
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:20.170
And I think it marks a bit of a change for, um,

67
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.130
for theorists and potential Nobel prize winners. And I think it's a great thing.

68
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:27.910
I absolutely applaud it so long to make this continue. And maybe it's, uh,

69
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.150
once again, uh,

70
00:03:29.151 --> 00:03:31.690
so Roger is going to be a bit of a trailblazer for everybody else.

71
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.211
<v 1>Well,</v>

72
00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:35.490
it's really all about showing that there's a very massive object at the center

73
00:03:35.491 --> 00:03:40.410
of the galaxy and in principle showing, measuring the mass of something,

74
00:03:40.411 --> 00:03:43.410
showing that there is a massive object somewhere is reasonably straightforward

75
00:03:43.411 --> 00:03:45.600
in astronomy. In that, for example,

76
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.500
we know that the sun's at the center of the solar system, not just because,

77
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.820
you know, it glows in the sky,

78
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.060
but actually because it holds all the planets in orbit around it.

79
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.060
And so actually even if the sun weren't giving out any light at all,

80
00:03:57.061 --> 00:04:00.360
we'd be able to say there's a massive object in the center of the solar system.

81
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.930
And actually we'd even be able to say what its mass was just by studying the

82
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.470
orbit of the earth and the other planets around it. So in principle,

83
00:04:07.471 --> 00:04:08.730
you can sort of do that,

84
00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:11.610
make that kind of measurement for anything which is gravitation you bound

85
00:04:11.611 --> 00:04:12.990
together. And in essence,

86
00:04:12.991 --> 00:04:15.120
that's what they've done for the center of the Milky way.

87
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.990
In that they'd been looking at the stars orbiting around the center of the Milky

88
00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:22.440
way and showing that the orbits they're following imply that there's a very

89
00:04:22.441 --> 00:04:24.510
massive object at the center of the Milky way.

90
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.260
It sounds very simple the way I say it there. Um, of course in practice,

91
00:04:28.261 --> 00:04:32.760
it's a huge amount, more complicated and in part that's because,

92
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.940
so it's part in part is because you're looking at something which is pretty

93
00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:39.330
small in that the whole of the region that they're looking at,

94
00:04:39.331 --> 00:04:43.290
where those things are all orbiting around a rule within an arc second or so.

95
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.880
And that's the scale on which if you just take a picture of a star, uh,

96
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.170
with the telescope from the ground,

97
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.650
typically the atmosphere blurs out the image to about an arc second.

98
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.980
So actually all those stars packed in with those central field.

99
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.610
Arcseconds if you just took a naive picture of the center of the galaxy with the

100
00:04:59.611 --> 00:05:00.444
telescope,

101
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.820
they will be blurred together and you wouldn't actually be able to see anything

102
00:05:02.821 --> 00:05:04.080
at all and follow their emotion.

103
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.070
The other complication is that the center of the Milky way is a very difficult

104
00:05:08.071 --> 00:05:11.850
place to see because between us and the center of the galaxy,

105
00:05:11.851 --> 00:05:14.070
there's a huge amount of Merck. This, this,

106
00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:16.020
this stuff that astronomy is referred to as dust,

107
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:18.420
it's sort of this city smoky material,

108
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.180
which obscures the view of the center of the galaxy,

109
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.130
which essentially means that very little of the light coming from the center of

110
00:05:26.131 --> 00:05:29.490
the galaxy gets to us. If you look in the optical part of the spectrum,

111
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.750
it's something like, you know,

112
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.620
one photon in 10 billion emitted near the center of the galaxy actually gets to

113
00:05:34.621 --> 00:05:36.360
it. So there's no chance of actually seeing it.

114
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.120
The solution to both of these problems actually came along sort of in the 1990s

115
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.410
when, um, astronomers started first making images,

116
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.870
decent images in the infrared part of the spectrum.

117
00:05:48.871 --> 00:05:51.180
So it sort of technology driven that we started getting the,

118
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.210
the detectors that allow us to make images, uh,

119
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.680
in the infrared part of the spectrum,

120
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.520
where previously we'd really only been able to make optical images.

121
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.900
And the infrared has two big advantages. Firstly, that,

122
00:06:01.901 --> 00:06:03.920
that Merck is more or less transparent.

123
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.180
So instead of sort of one photon in 10 billion getting through it's something

124
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:10.160
like one photon in five gets through.

125
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.660
So there's still a fair amount of it gets obscured by the dust between us and

126
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:17.960
the center of the galaxy, but actually enough gets through that.

127
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:19.310
You can start making images.

128
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.530
The other big advantage of the infrared is it's more straightforward to take out

129
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:27.830
those blurring effects of the atmosphere to sharpen up the images.

130
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.080
And so a lot of the,

131
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.190
the breakthroughs in this area I've come because adaptive optics,

132
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:37.340
these techniques that astronomers use to take out the blurring effects of the

133
00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:40.310
atmosphere work well in the infrared part of the spectrum.

134
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.830
So they've really been able to sharpen up those images.

135
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:46.820
So instead of seeing those 20 or 30 stars near the center of the galaxy,

136
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.830
all blurred together into a single splodge,

137
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.900
they really can make pictures of the individual stars and that has enabled them

138
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.740
to monitor those stars and actually literally see them orbiting around the

139
00:06:57.741 --> 00:07:00.560
center of the Milky way, apparently around nothing.

140
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.900
There's nothing very much there. Well, it's a radio source there.

141
00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:06.140
So there's something there that we thought was a bit suspicious and that's

142
00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:09.340
something that gives out radio waves. Um, but there's not, there's no,

143
00:07:09.341 --> 00:07:12.710
there's no obvious star there or anything bright there. Um,

144
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.740
and these stars near the center of the galaxy are all following these nice

145
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.260
elliptical orbits, just like the planets around the sun,

146
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.140
whizzing around something which doesn't appear to be there.

147
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.310
And now they've been able to observe them for long enough that some of those

148
00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:28.010
stars they've actually seen them go round. They're complete elliptical orbits.

149
00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:31.850
Now that gives you a very strong constraint on, okay, I can actually measure,

150
00:07:31.851 --> 00:07:35.660
I know what the pull of gravity has to be to be making things orbit around the

151
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:38.480
center of the galaxy at that speed.

152
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:42.890
And that's how they come up with this number of a super massive object in that

153
00:07:42.891 --> 00:07:46.610
central region of the Milky way of a few million times, the mass of the sun.

154
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.520
<v 0>So it's called a singularity,</v>

155
00:07:48.521 --> 00:07:51.490
the black hole singularity where Penrose entered the game.

156
00:07:51.491 --> 00:07:54.760
Was he writing this paper? And in, uh, in 1965,

157
00:07:54.761 --> 00:07:56.800
which basically shocked the world of physics.

158
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.730
And basically what Penrose showed was that this thing already was liking was

159
00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:03.880
there, okay. That it was predicted by general relativity.

160
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:09.340
So what happened previously is people like Oppenheimer and Schneider had been

161
00:08:09.341 --> 00:08:11.830
looking at things like sort of collapsing, uh, you know,

162
00:08:11.831 --> 00:08:13.720
it's fairly symmetric collapsing,

163
00:08:13.721 --> 00:08:16.300
sort of clouds of dust and shells and things like that.

164
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.210
And in these very symmetric scenarios,

165
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:23.890
they were seeing it as thought those symmetric sort of distributions of matter

166
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.480
collapsed in that indeed you would fall a black hole and at the center of that

167
00:08:28.481 --> 00:08:32.080
black hole would be one of these dreaded singularities and people were like,

168
00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:34.090
all right, we're not taking that seriously.

169
00:08:34.091 --> 00:08:37.780
That's just because you were considering a situation with an awful lot of

170
00:08:37.781 --> 00:08:42.640
symmetry. That's the only reason that read singularity, that weird infinity,

171
00:08:42.641 --> 00:08:43.840
that madness is there,

172
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:49.270
but what Penrose showed was it wasn't really at a counter this symmetry,

173
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.710
it would always be there. Okay. Did,

174
00:08:51.711 --> 00:08:56.340
this was really an artifact of general relativity that black holes do these

175
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:57.840
similarities. Okay.

176
00:08:57.841 --> 00:09:01.110
He proved the singularity theorems and it was much more general.

177
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.520
It didn't require symmetry. It was extremely general statement.

178
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.270
All you had to say was basically as long as I have effectively positive energy,

179
00:09:09.271 --> 00:09:11.520
if I'm thinking about matter, that's made of a positive energy,

180
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.920
then I'm guaranteed, then it collapses form black hole.

181
00:09:13.921 --> 00:09:17.760
I'm guaranteed to get one of these singularities, which is basically,

182
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:20.070
it's just an end of space or an end of time.

183
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:24.470
<v 1>It's one of those things that kind of crept up on the field in that, you know,</v>

184
00:09:24.471 --> 00:09:28.550
back in the 1960s, people started discovering these things called quasars,

185
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.430
which were these incredibly bright, distant objects,

186
00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.870
which were varying on timescales of days or at least, you know,

187
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.920
weeks and months as well. Um, which tells you to have to be very small, right,

188
00:09:39.921 --> 00:09:42.410
for something to very, very quickly, you know,

189
00:09:42.411 --> 00:09:44.450
if you actually had a whole galaxies worth of stars,

190
00:09:44.451 --> 00:09:46.970
even if you found some way of switching them all off and on,

191
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.480
because of the amount of time it takes light to travel just from one side of the

192
00:09:50.481 --> 00:09:51.410
galaxy to the other,

193
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.170
you wouldn't see the whole thing switching on and off very quickly.

194
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:58.940
So when you see something varying on timescales of say a few months that tells

195
00:09:58.941 --> 00:10:01.400
you, it can only be a few light months across.

196
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:04.040
So these quasars were varying on very short timescales,

197
00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:07.550
which told you they were very small and they were also incredibly bright.

198
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.810
And this combination of things, people were costing around trying to figure out,

199
00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:15.500
could they be supermassive stars or various other ideas were thrown around.

200
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:18.710
But the, the idea that one out is that had to be a very,

201
00:10:18.711 --> 00:10:21.710
very massive object and material was falling into it.

202
00:10:21.711 --> 00:10:24.590
And you were seeing the kind of the energy that was liberated as the material

203
00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:25.424
fell into it.

204
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:29.000
And that would both give you a lot of energy because if the thing's very

205
00:10:29.001 --> 00:10:30.770
compact, the polar gravity is very strong.

206
00:10:30.771 --> 00:10:33.560
So the stuff falls in extremely fast and you have a lot of energy,

207
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.100
but it's all in a very small region. And so it varies very quickly. So that was,

208
00:10:37.101 --> 00:10:40.520
you know, as I say, back in the 1960s, 19, early 1970s,

209
00:10:40.521 --> 00:10:44.120
people were starting to think about it in the 1970s,

210
00:10:44.121 --> 00:10:47.750
this radio source at the center of the Milky way, Sagittarius a star,

211
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.270
which is where this black hole is located, was found.

212
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.740
And that got people thinking, well,

213
00:10:51.741 --> 00:10:53.780
maybe there's one in the middle of the Milky way as well.

214
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:58.250
With the advent of the Hubble space telescope in the 1990s,

215
00:10:58.251 --> 00:11:01.670
we were for the first time able to actually start, um,

216
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:07.190
resolving regions, close enough to the center of other galaxies to see actually,

217
00:11:07.191 --> 00:11:09.920
yes, stars are whizzing around extremely fast there as well.

218
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:14.840
So it's one of those things that kind of crept up on us a bit at the time. Um,

219
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.210
but this is sort of, you know, this is the, the, the,

220
00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:21.500
the best measurement we have the ultimate measurement and actually at some

221
00:11:21.501 --> 00:11:24.740
level, you know, knowing it's there in our own galaxy tells us quite, you know,

222
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:28.070
quite how commonplace is, is that even an ordinary galaxy,

223
00:11:28.071 --> 00:11:30.380
like ours has a massive black hole in the middle of it.

224
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:34.130
<v 0>What did Penrose Shalisha? He showed that,</v>

225
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:38.510
that the space-time wasn't complete inside the black hole and what he shared was

226
00:11:38.511 --> 00:11:39.344
it wasn't

227
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:44.860
[inaudible] GD ethics or the sort of shortest parts in space time that a puffs

228
00:11:44.861 --> 00:11:48.050
that a particle will take. If it's, if it's not accelerating through space type,

229
00:11:48.051 --> 00:11:51.050
it'll follow a shortest path. Now, shearing,

230
00:11:51.051 --> 00:11:53.530
you are a mortar and you can in principle live through,

231
00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:57.970
as long as time could exist, you would just follow Judy's six forever. Okay.

232
00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:00.850
You would just go on and on and on and on and on. Right.

233
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.170
What Penrose showed was if you fall into a black hole and you follow one of

234
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:09.430
these GDD things, eventually the GDC itself will grind to a halt.

235
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:10.750
I think about what that really means.

236
00:12:10.751 --> 00:12:15.580
That means there's an end to either time or space is actually an

237
00:12:15.581 --> 00:12:18.430
end to timeless space. So even though you might think you're immortal,

238
00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:22.120
nothing can destroy you well, the end of time can destroy you.

239
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.280
So if you're falling into one of these black holes,

240
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.340
you're falling one of these GDS X, depending on the nature of the GDS,

241
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:31.030
you will start to feel very strong gravitational fields.

242
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.450
You'll start to feel yourself being ripped apart by the tides of gravity,

243
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.740
literally, you know, the atoms in your body being torn apart. And then,

244
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.800
you know, as you sort of beg for mercy, you know,

245
00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:42.910
even if you're capable of backing,

246
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:46.180
because you're asked as a veto to pose you beg for mercy, what you'll find is,

247
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:51.190
is that you'll be given that messy because time itself or possibly space,

248
00:12:51.191 --> 00:12:53.710
but in the case of, um, depends on the nature of the black hole,

249
00:12:53.711 --> 00:12:58.120
but time itself will end. Okay. So even though you think you're a immortal,

250
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.240
well, it doesn't matter because there is no more time, time itself stops.

251
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:05.470
And that's what Penrose showed that these things are really lurking there inside

252
00:13:05.471 --> 00:13:06.230
black holes.

253
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.231
<v 1>Well,</v>

254
00:13:06.231 --> 00:13:09.630
we talked about these stars orbiting around very close to the center of the

255
00:13:09.631 --> 00:13:13.440
Milky way. They're still, you know, so there's one particular star S two,

256
00:13:13.441 --> 00:13:15.450
which is the one that's gone closest to the center.

257
00:13:15.451 --> 00:13:18.840
And that's one that they've now followed around a full orbit. And in fact,

258
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:22.950
he got so close. You remember, if you think about elliptical orbits, uh,

259
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.380
like comments in the solar system, for example,

260
00:13:25.381 --> 00:13:27.390
when they're kind of in their outskirts. So their orbits,

261
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.880
they travel very slowly and then they whizzed past the sun and then back out

262
00:13:29.881 --> 00:13:33.000
again, it's just the same story here. The stars hang around.

263
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.220
And then when they're close to the black hole,

264
00:13:35.221 --> 00:13:38.040
they whiz past it and then slow down when they're traveling away from it.

265
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.490
The one that went closest to the, um,

266
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:45.810
to the black hole at the center of the Milky way was traveling at about two and

267
00:13:45.811 --> 00:13:47.130
a half percent of the speed of light.

268
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.880
So it was actually a decent fraction of the speed of light and God sufficiently

269
00:13:50.881 --> 00:13:53.190
coasts that there's all sorts of, interesting things you can do with it.

270
00:13:53.191 --> 00:13:54.024
For example,

271
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:58.740
it was sufficiently close to the black hole that the light escaping from it not

272
00:13:58.741 --> 00:14:00.030
only had to escape from the star,

273
00:14:00.031 --> 00:14:02.820
but had to escape from the gravitational field of the black hole as well.

274
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:05.610
And so they were able to measure that gravitational red shift,

275
00:14:05.611 --> 00:14:08.940
the energy that the light lost as it was escaping from the region of the black

276
00:14:08.941 --> 00:14:13.890
hole. But even in these cases, we're still, you know, we're still the distance.

277
00:14:13.891 --> 00:14:17.670
I think it was a hundred or so astronomical units from the,

278
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.690
the putative black hole in the center of the Milky way. Um,

279
00:14:21.691 --> 00:14:24.420
so sort of a hundred times the distance of the earth to the sun,

280
00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.470
which is about a thousand or so times this thing called the short shield radius,

281
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.600
which at some level is sort of the size of the black hole.

282
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.110
It's that point of no return where even light can't escape.

283
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:38.520
So the sort of the size of the black hole was a thousand times smaller than the

284
00:14:38.521 --> 00:14:42.480
scale that this star was probing. So we can't actually say,

285
00:14:42.481 --> 00:14:46.290
we can say within a thousand times the size of a black hole as the mass of a

286
00:14:46.291 --> 00:14:48.840
black hole, but for it to actually be definitely a black hole,

287
00:14:48.841 --> 00:14:50.880
we have to be able to say, you know, within one times the,

288
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.230
of the black hole versus that much mess, but actually we can only say it's,

289
00:14:54.231 --> 00:14:55.880
within a thousand times that region,

290
00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.290
there is nothing else that anyone could think of that would pack that much mass

291
00:15:00.291 --> 00:15:03.050
into that smaller region that wasn't a black hole,

292
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:08.150
but that's why they sort of hedge their bets that tiny bit in the citation by

293
00:15:08.151 --> 00:15:11.000
just saying this, this, the huge amount of mass in this very small region,

294
00:15:11.001 --> 00:15:13.940
rather than saying there is a black hole left. I mean, the mass of the,

295
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:17.210
of whatever is there is incredibly accurately determined.

296
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.800
I'd have to look up the number now, but it says,

297
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:23.540
I think the best measurement of it is it's 4.15 plus or minus

298
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.690
0.01 million solar masses.

299
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.870
So that's an incredibly, you know, by astronomical standards,

300
00:15:29.871 --> 00:15:32.720
usually in astronomy, we're happy if we get something within a factor of two,

301
00:15:32.721 --> 00:15:33.800
right? So actually, you know,

302
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:38.480
measuring something to that level of precision is incredible that they know very

303
00:15:38.481 --> 00:15:40.400
accurately how much master is there.

304
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:44.810
They just don't know for sure that it's all compressed within a region,

305
00:15:44.811 --> 00:15:48.430
small enough that it has to be a black hole. Um, so as I say,

306
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:51.110
almost certainly is there's nothing else that anyone could think of that would

307
00:15:51.111 --> 00:15:53.840
explain it. Um, but they haven't in that sense,

308
00:15:53.841 --> 00:15:56.420
seen a black hole in the same way that for example,

309
00:15:56.421 --> 00:16:00.110
the event horizon telescope was able to actually image very close to a black

310
00:16:00.111 --> 00:16:03.800
hole itself. They're actually looking at a slightly larger region, um,

311
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.740
which is telling you how much mass is there. And it's all very concentrated,

312
00:16:06.741 --> 00:16:10.250
but it doesn't in itself tell you for certain that there's a black hole there.

313
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:11.960
They were very much in competition with each other.

314
00:16:11.961 --> 00:16:15.110
So there were two groups in the world. So gets working at UCLA,

315
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:20.120
UCLA in California, was using the Keck telescopes in Hawaii.

316
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:24.530
And Gainesville was working in Germany and using the European Southern

317
00:16:24.531 --> 00:16:26.600
observatory telescopes in Chile. Um,

318
00:16:26.601 --> 00:16:29.930
so they really were sort of in competition and it's one of those sort of healthy

319
00:16:29.931 --> 00:16:32.990
competitions. I don't think it was, you know, it wasn't that they weren't, uh,

320
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:36.890
um, unpleasant towards each other. It's just one of those things.

321
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:39.950
There was an exciting thing that sort of occurred to both of them at the same

322
00:16:39.951 --> 00:16:44.000
time. They both started working on it at this more or less the same time. Um,

323
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.000
and they've sort of both been competing to get the results out,

324
00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.820
which is both healthy and that it's sort of competition.

325
00:16:49.821 --> 00:16:52.400
It drives us on to do things better. Um,

326
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:56.030
but also it's sort of healthy to have that cross-check because if it was only

327
00:16:56.031 --> 00:16:58.880
one person in the world was claiming they'd found something, you know,

328
00:16:58.881 --> 00:17:00.040
you always think, you know,

329
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.110
could they possibly have made a mistake somewhere along the line? Um,

330
00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.690
so it's good to have two completely different groups using different

331
00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:09.590
instrumentation and potentially different techniques for analyzing their data.

332
00:17:09.591 --> 00:17:12.110
And so on both arriving at essentially the same conclusion.

333
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:17.290
<v 0>We have sort of a one corner of the Penrose Institute and we had the first and</v>

334
00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:21.070
the sort of ignore inaugural workshop at the Penrose Institute took place right

335
00:17:21.071 --> 00:17:22.420
here in Nottingham a couple of years ago.

336
00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:27.160
And he was here for extended periods and drank a cup of coffee in the,

337
00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:30.760
in the library there and taught for a long time about physics.

338
00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.540
He also gave us some lectures, which were fabulous. And, and,

339
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.490
and the remarkable thing about it was this is a guy who's well into his eighties

340
00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.000
and these lectures were going on for like two hours and his stomach was

341
00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:44.650
astonishing. I first met him sort of, well, it's probably about 10,

342
00:17:44.651 --> 00:17:49.120
15 years ago now. And, uh, I was a postdoc in Oxford and he was,

343
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:53.670
he was actually retired by that point. Uh, but the, this,

344
00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:56.190
this idea he'd had in, in a sort of late sixties,

345
00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.900
early seventies twisters suddenly came back into fashion and he came out of

346
00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:05.610
retirement to give us all, some lectures on it. And, uh, well,

347
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:08.130
our remember about those lectures was, I mean, never five minutes,

348
00:18:08.131 --> 00:18:11.910
but what I remember most about them was how good he was at drawing pictures.

349
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.180
He would draw these pictures in the latches. So they were just also,

350
00:18:15.181 --> 00:18:17.490
it's like what Greg is. He's, he's, he's not just a great mathematician.

351
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:21.570
And a great physics is greater, is a great artist as well. So it saves cells.

352
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.580
That was one thing that stuck in my mind of, uh, of, uh,

353
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:25.860
early days of meeting Roger Penrose.

354
00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:28.860
But obviously he's a legend to physics and maths, and, um,

355
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.900
it's been a privilege to have a minimal and not skim.

356
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.790
And it's great that he's won the Nobel prize.

357
00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.380
<v 2>That poses a few problems. I'm sure you can imagine.</v>

358
00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.040
One of them is the fact that as you tip the mirror through the night to look at

359
00:18:40.041 --> 00:18:41.270
different angles of the sky,

360
00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.170
gravity starts to affect the mirror and deformed ever so slightly.

361
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:50.180
So what you do is you have something called active optics, which are,

362
00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.070
see all those little pistons there.

363
00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:54.170
<v 3>There's 150 actuators,</v>

364
00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:57.380
basically little pistons that can push and pull.
