00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.110
<v 0>X 17. Yeah, it's been around for a while. I think if it's around.</v>

2
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.223
<v 1>Rather.</v>

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.130
<v 0>I think couple of, uh,</v>

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.810
2016 was the first time I came across this work done by

5
00:00:14.811 --> 00:00:19.490
these nuclear physicists in Hungary. They were looking at,

6
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.000
um, beryllium the, the nucleus of beryllium,

7
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.700
that's got four protons and four neutrons in it.

8
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.860
You can excite this nucleus. We know with atoms and electrons, right?

9
00:00:30.861 --> 00:00:33.260
If you excite the electrons in an atom,

10
00:00:33.261 --> 00:00:37.790
they raise up an energy level and then they don't want to stay there.

11
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.230
We're all lazy, really, right.

12
00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:43.790
We want to go back to what we call our ground States and that's how we produce

13
00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:47.960
light. And so we're all familiar with the consequences of that. But in fact,

14
00:00:47.961 --> 00:00:49.670
you can do it with a nucleus as well.

15
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.710
What they do is they create an excited beryllium nucleus by

16
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.320
they ha they start with a lithium nucleus,

17
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.450
and then they attach a proton to it. So a very specific energy.

18
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.090
So here's my lithium nucleus and incomes, a proton with a very specific energy.

19
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.450
It then forms a beryllium nucleus, which is already as an excited state.

20
00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:16.040
So the handout excited state is compared to its natural ground state.

21
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.020
It doesn't want to stay like this. Right?

22
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.010
And so what actually usually happens is it just disintegrates again,

23
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.510
it just goes back to the proton, goes out and elect with the lithium,

24
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.310
but every now and again,

25
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.210
what actually happens is as it drops back down to its ground state,

26
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.010
is it emits a virtual photon and that virtual photon just

27
00:01:37.011 --> 00:01:41.120
goes and disappears off on you then every now and again,

28
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.930
even less likely is the, is that it admits the photon.

29
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.430
And then the photon itself creates a pair of electron,

30
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.150
an electron positron pair and E plus B minus pair.

31
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.870
Now what usually happens is in those situations,

32
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.430
the photons coming out. And so the, the two particles,

33
00:02:01.431 --> 00:02:04.160
the electrons and positrons pair, they're very light particles.

34
00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:08.720
So when they're created, they're almost colinear with, with the outgoing photon.

35
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.610
So photons coming out towards you,

36
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.360
Brady and then the electron positron pair of created. And,

37
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.980
and so the angle between them,

38
00:02:15.981 --> 00:02:19.250
this is the crucial thing is usually rent remains small.

39
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.220
And so as the angle increases the number of electron positron pairs that

40
00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:29.120
come out at larger and larger angles decreases because it doesn't want to do it.

41
00:02:29.121 --> 00:02:32.360
It wants to create come out because of conservation of momentum,

42
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.380
easier for it to come out.

43
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.023
<v 1>Straightforward.</v>

44
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.750
<v 0>People noticed was that, um,</v>

45
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.890
at an angle of about 140 degrees. So let's see, this is zero,

46
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.650
uh, is that 90? And so 140, I mean, is, is out here.

47
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.600
They found a bump. They found an increase in the number of,

48
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.780
uh, electron positron pairs out. And we know from our Higgs there,

49
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.190
that if you've got an increase in number of events,

50
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:09.700
then some it's a potential sign that something's funny going on,

51
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.690
that you would normally have expected this number coming out as you increase the

52
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.490
angle, just to drop off on the tonically,

53
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.620
but it suddenly it went up what could be causing this

54
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.660
one interpretation is it's,

55
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.700
it's a particle that's being produced that then declares itself into the E

56
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.380
plus C minus. And this is the X particle. And when they work out,

57
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.090
given the angle that the E plus C minus pair come out 140

58
00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:40.810
degrees, you can work out what the corresponding mass of the particle must be.

59
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.860
And it's 17 million electron volts, 17 MEV.

60
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.520
And that's where the X 17 comes from. It's the, it's the,

61
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.600
the mass of this particle incomes.

62
00:03:52.601 --> 00:03:57.040
The initial proton comes out in, from outside. The lithium hits the lithium,

63
00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.860
converts it into a beryllium nucleus,

64
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.550
which has now got four protons and neutrons by fine tuning,

65
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:05.800
the incoming proton energy.

66
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.750
You can raise the energy level of this nuclei of the beryllium to

67
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.760
actually, I think is 18.16 MEV million electron volts.

68
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.270
And that's an excited static. It is not the ground state.

69
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.950
It then declares as it declares rather than creating the photon,

70
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:27.070
which then creates the electron positron pair.

71
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.860
It creates this X particles.

72
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.790
<v 2>So that's when the X 17 happens during the,</v>

73
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.370
during the relaxation of the excited.

74
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.540
<v 0>It creates this, but it's a massive particle. So it's coming out now with,</v>

75
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.320
with relatively low momentum. That then means that when it,

76
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.100
when it decays to when it does it split, it,

77
00:04:47.101 --> 00:04:49.740
does it split create the electron positron pair.

78
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.360
There can come out to a large angle, uh, whereas a photon couldn't.

79
00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:55.740
Cause if I was a high momentum,

80
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.640
it's going to then want to go directly into the policy minus in the same

81
00:04:59.641 --> 00:05:00.150
direction.

82
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.320
<v 2>So because the X 17 is so sluggish and has less momentum,</v>

83
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.100
it creates this ability to do a wider angle. I don't know.

84
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.780
<v 0>Anglia split and it, and so that was the interpretation and there,</v>

85
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.250
they wrote this up. It didn't do a lot for Lee for awhile for a few months.

86
00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:21.030
It sort of led there. But I remember reading a paper by, um,

87
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.240
Jonathan Fang and his collaborators Irvine,

88
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.640
where they were looking at this experiment and trying to interpret this

89
00:05:29.641 --> 00:05:33.170
results in terms of some model. And so it was then that I,

90
00:05:33.171 --> 00:05:38.040
I remember reading it and thinking, in order to explain this result,

91
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.260
they are having to do something some twists and turns in the particle physics

92
00:05:43.261 --> 00:05:46.680
beyond what you would normally expect from the standard model of particle

93
00:05:46.681 --> 00:05:50.550
physics in order to get these it's a,

94
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.460
this X particle is a Bosun, it's got spin one,

95
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.210
and there have been experiments looking for these particles.

96
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.140
[inaudible] experiment is one at CERN,

97
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.300
which had been looking for virtual bows zones like these and hadn't found any.

98
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.223
And in fact,

99
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.030
it would natively have ruled out this experiment of the beryllium from their own

100
00:06:11.031 --> 00:06:11.864
results.

101
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.780
And in order to sort of make sure the two were compatible Fang and

102
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.380
collaborators realized that one way of doing it would be to effectively change

103
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:25.910
some of the interactions that the protons were having with this X

104
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:29.060
particle such that it would be access.

105
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.120
It would be allowed for the beryllium experiment to do what it was doing,

106
00:06:32.121 --> 00:06:36.980
but it would account for the fact that the [inaudible] experiment was not

107
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.420
seeing anything it's generated a lot of interest. I mean,

108
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:45.050
I think there's like 140 papers have been written,

109
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.560
citing this original work, but it was back in 2016.

110
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.530
I think the thing that has caused the renewed interest,

111
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.150
the same group in hungry produced new results this time not

112
00:06:56.151 --> 00:06:59.930
using beryllium, but using a helium nucleus,

113
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.760
they did the same sorts of experiments. And they found that once again, there,

114
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.170
there was a bump when they were looking at the,

115
00:07:07.171 --> 00:07:10.790
the creation of the electron positron pear, they found a bump,

116
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:14.660
not 140 degrees, which was the result for the beryllium, but, uh,

117
00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:18.500
I think 115 degrees. And when they work,

118
00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.580
then work backwards and took into account the fact that this was a helium

119
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:24.650
nucleus and not a beryllium nucleus,

120
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.850
they once again found that the corresponding mass of the particle,

121
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.800
that if you understood it as from the decay of a particle was I think

122
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:37.190
it's 16.7 million electron volts, again,

123
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.270
comparable to what they had before. That sounds like a smoking gun.

124
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.500
It does sound like a smoking gun it's quite intriguing, but in the meantime,

125
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.930
there have been the initial results, um, that they,

126
00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.840
they obtained in 2016 has of course,

127
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.370
got people thinking about this. And the,

128
00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.890
the experimentalists at CERN have been, there's a,

129
00:08:00.891 --> 00:08:03.410
an experiment called I think it's an S 64,

130
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:08.570
which published its results in 2006, 2018.

131
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:13.520
So about a year ago when they went looking for the original

132
00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:17.810
X particle, right, they went looking for, uh, for, uh, uh, gauged Bozon,

133
00:08:17.811 --> 00:08:21.350
which had a massive about 16.7 million electron volts.

134
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:26.180
And the way they did it was they used the super protons synchrotron

135
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.980
Collider at CERN.

136
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.290
They had a beam of electrons of about a hundred GV

137
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.910
giga electron volts. They collided it into a target.

138
00:08:37.911 --> 00:08:42.410
So it's called a beam dump that collided it into a target because if this

139
00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:43.520
particle was there,

140
00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:47.450
what would happen is that electrons that were being stopped as it hit,

141
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:51.500
the target could interact with actually [inaudible] said

142
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.480
[inaudible] and the targets,

143
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.930
and they in principle could produce this X particle.

144
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:03.420
And then the X particle bean with its interactions could actually leave the

145
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:04.290
beam dump.

146
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:09.780
And it would then decay further down the chain and in a

147
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.780
set of detectors creating the plus minus pair.

148
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.770
And so what they were looking for with these two sort of almost simultaneous

149
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:20.970
events, not quite simultaneous where the beam dump loses an amount of energy,

150
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.750
but that same amount of energy is found further down the line.

151
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.430
And the interpretation would be the electron had, as it hit,

152
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:32.430
the Zed Bozon would have created this particle,

153
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.840
which then moved out from the beam dump further down into the depths detection

154
00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:40.440
decade. And they didn't see it. They saw no evidence of it.

155
00:09:40.441 --> 00:09:44.790
And so that has allowed them to rule out regions of the parameter

156
00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:49.710
space that the original paper was was exploring.

157
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.680
But this new results,

158
00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:57.630
which is with the helium sort of is it sounds like a smoking gun

159
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.790
in some ways it is because it's a new nuclei, but what's,

160
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:03.811
it's really,

161
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:08.400
really crying out for is another experiment along the same lines as the

162
00:10:08.401 --> 00:10:11.400
beryllium one, but done by a different team. Right?

163
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.220
<v 2>Why did we, why did people so readily.</v>

164
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.700
<v 0>Accepted the Higgs? Well, I think there were two major reasons.</v>

165
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:19.110
One was mathematically.

166
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.560
It was expected to be in the ballpark where it was found.

167
00:10:22.561 --> 00:10:26.700
That's why they built the LHC with the energy they did on the size of did.

168
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.810
So the mathematics of the standard model and beyond the standard model had

169
00:10:30.811 --> 00:10:32.730
suggested there should be something there.

170
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:38.070
And then two detectors totally separate detectors found it

171
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:40.970
effectively, simultaneously. They were finding evidence for the Higgs.

172
00:10:40.971 --> 00:10:42.870
That's the CMS detector in Atlas.

173
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:46.950
We're finding it simultaneously in this case,

174
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.460
there's one experiment and is found it once. It's,

175
00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:54.450
there's a bit of a track record where they have found events before that have,

176
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.470
that have disappeared,

177
00:10:55.471 --> 00:10:59.310
found evidence for these bosoms of different masses that have disappeared.

178
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:02.610
They're arguing this as, uh, a stronger result,

179
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.650
but they found it for beryllium. And now for helium, that that's positive.

180
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.570
But what it's really requiring is another experiment along those lines to come

181
00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:15.000
along and say yes, and confirm it.

182
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.500
<v 2>Have other teams try to,</v>

183
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:22.400
are there other teams around the world who've done similar experiments and said,

184
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.800
we haven't found that bump at those angles.

185
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.080
<v 0>Not aware of other experiments,</v>

186
00:11:27.081 --> 00:11:31.040
doing exactly what the brilliant Hungarian guys are doing,

187
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:34.610
because they're doing a proper nuclear physics experiment.

188
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.970
And so this is this interesting interface between nuclear physics,

189
00:11:37.971 --> 00:11:41.450
natural particle physics, that the, the experience that I'm aware of, uh,

190
00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:44.120
testing this, uh, particle physics experiments,

191
00:11:44.121 --> 00:11:49.010
colliding electrons that are high energy into a beam dump and looking

192
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:53.650
for different types of detectors, looking for dark matter detectors. I mean,

193
00:11:53.651 --> 00:11:56.260
one of the exciting things about this result,

194
00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.360
if it was to hold is that there are dark matter

195
00:12:01.361 --> 00:12:04.960
models, which would have a particle of around 10,

196
00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:07.540
20 million electron volts.

197
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.800
These light particles could be there. And, and these,

198
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.410
there are models where there are these vector. Bosons

199
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.600
when I talked about the why, why did we believe the Higgs? I said, well,

200
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:24.520
because the standard model was suggesting and beyond the sesh suggesting sh

201
00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:26.230
it should be there. It was in the mathematics.

202
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.910
One of the things that has had they've had to do in this particular case from

203
00:12:30.911 --> 00:12:34.690
the theoretical standpoint is you we've had to do some quite

204
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:40.390
severe twists and turns to the particle physics to make sure we can

205
00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:45.190
accommodate this result in terms of a particle whilst also accepting

206
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:50.650
[inaudible], didn't find it at CERN. It's not an easy fit. It's not an easy fit.

207
00:12:50.651 --> 00:12:55.140
And in fact, you've basically had to introduce a new charge that, that,

208
00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:59.290
that accounts for why this X particle doesn't interact with the proton,

209
00:12:59.291 --> 00:13:02.680
like it would with the electron. And in fact, it's,

210
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:07.780
it's called proto phobic. It doesn't want to interact with the proton.

211
00:13:07.781 --> 00:13:11.410
It will happily now interact with the neutron, but not with the proton.

212
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:14.800
And that's unusual photons normally will interact with the, with the,

213
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.560
with the proton and you're forcing this to do it.

214
00:13:17.561 --> 00:13:21.790
And so you'd need to look for examples, why this is not happening.

215
00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.640
<v 2>Is there another logical explanation doing the rounds?</v>

216
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.250
Are there other physicists who are saying, Oh, no,

217
00:13:29.251 --> 00:13:33.960
I can explain those bumps at those angles. It could just be, you know, XYZ ed.

218
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:38.710
<v 0>I think that if you want it to be, so one possibility is, as I said,</v>

219
00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.720
if it's one possibility, that's a mistake. Oh yeah. So we should,

220
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:45.900
should point that out. Of course, right? That, um, there,

221
00:13:45.901 --> 00:13:48.630
that's another reason why you need to do this experiment with another group

222
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:53.190
that, that, or maybe they've got their systematics wrong, perhaps this bumpers.

223
00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:54.920
I mean, the, the,

224
00:13:54.921 --> 00:13:59.340
the words you hear is this is like a seven Sigma detection or seven Sigma means

225
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:04.110
it's one, one chance in a hundred billion. That it's a random event.

226
00:14:04.111 --> 00:14:05.010
I mean that, so,

227
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:10.380
but if you've missed some big systematic that that could all go away,

228
00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:15.870
I'm not aware of any sort of realistic accepted

229
00:14:15.871 --> 00:14:20.520
particle physics explanations as to what this is other than people coming in

230
00:14:20.521 --> 00:14:24.840
with this idea of a particle or the possibility that it's,

231
00:14:24.841 --> 00:14:26.400
it's actually not there at all.

232
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:30.300
We've just got to go and revisit the systematics of the experiment.

233
00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:35.610
<v 2>If we imagine the X 17 particle is legit, it is real, right.</v>

234
00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.160
Yeah. What can you tell me about it? Can you give me an IC,

235
00:14:38.161 --> 00:14:41.730
can you give me an idea on it's like how big that is and what charge it is?

236
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:41.910
Yeah.

237
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:45.240
<v 0>So it's light. So, and an electron, which we,</v>

238
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:50.100
we actually tend to think of it as being almost massless right. Is half an MEV.

239
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.000
So this 34 times the massive,

240
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:57.560
the electron the proton is roughly a thousand MEV,

241
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.810
but th th you've you've as usual, you've come up with a key question,

242
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.150
which, which is that, um,

243
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:09.800
it's not particularly the pro the particle that's important here. And that,

244
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:14.360
why is that the particle in, in, in, in particle physics is,

245
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:18.920
is symptomatic of the existence of something else it's symptomatic of the

246
00:15:18.921 --> 00:15:20.900
existence of a, of a constant field.

247
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:25.970
So when we think of the photon and particle physics, the associated fields,

248
00:15:25.971 --> 00:15:30.740
the electromagnetic field, when we think of the, um, uh,

249
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.050
the Higgs particle,

250
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:37.400
that was discovered why people were so excited was the existence of the Hicks

251
00:15:37.401 --> 00:15:40.910
field and what the particles are.

252
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.270
And excitations of those fields, very strong excitations,

253
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:49.040
the existence of a field means that there's a force between there's an

254
00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:50.780
interaction between particles.

255
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:55.130
And so what you are finding here is if this particle really exists,

256
00:15:55.370 --> 00:16:00.020
there's an associated X field exists, and we have a fifth force.

257
00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.880
And the mass of this field is such that this could be a long range, fifth force.

258
00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:10.280
And then you've got all sorts of interesting possibilities coming in about why

259
00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.350
we're not detected it. What are,

260
00:16:12.351 --> 00:16:16.430
what are its subsequent properties and what other influences could it have on

261
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.500
the, on forces on nature?

262
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.360
We're always looking for fifth forces. I mean, well,

263
00:16:23.361 --> 00:16:26.270
some people would say it's a sixth force. Let me, which said,

264
00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:29.690
there's electromagnetism, there's the weak interactions,

265
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.940
the strong interactions, gravity,

266
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.250
the discovery of the Higgs is regarded as some,

267
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.800
as providing us with another interaction,

268
00:16:36.801 --> 00:16:40.220
which is the interaction of the Higgs field with particles. And,

269
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.450
but this new interaction is,

270
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:48.230
has not been detected before if it's there and it could

271
00:16:48.231 --> 00:16:49.430
open the, you know,

272
00:16:49.431 --> 00:16:53.150
there is many searches on for examples of either of these long range

273
00:16:53.151 --> 00:16:57.050
interactions with regard to the dark energy driving the acceleration of the

274
00:16:57.051 --> 00:17:01.520
universe with all, with regards to the presence of the particles themselves,

275
00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:02.840
is that matter candidates,

276
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:08.120
that there is a big push for these light dark matter candidates at the moment,

277
00:17:08.121 --> 00:17:08.661
because we're not,

278
00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:12.950
we haven't seen any evidence of supersymmetry in the large Hadron Collider,

279
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.920
which is usually associated with the existence of wimps.

280
00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.220
So the wimp dark matter candidate hasn't shown up yet.

281
00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.400
And so people are naturally beginning to sort of think, well,

282
00:17:22.401 --> 00:17:26.450
perhaps we should need to look further a field could X 17 be dark matter. Well,

283
00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:30.410
there's one possibility that are that matter candidates that are in that regime

284
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:32.330
in terms of their mass range. Now, I,

285
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:36.020
I don't know enough about the interaction cross section of this acts,

286
00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:38.630
17 particle with other particles.

287
00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:43.070
The people have looked in are looking in this mass range with these were called

288
00:17:43.071 --> 00:17:47.180
directed detectors, that direct dark matter detectors.

289
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.070
And they haven't seen anything,

290
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.700
but whether or not that in its own right yet says anything about these acts 17

291
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.750
remains to be seen.

292
00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.670
<v 2>X 17 has no charge. Like it's not negative,</v>

293
00:17:58.671 --> 00:18:00.920
like an electron or positive like proton.

294
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:06.290
<v 0>Um, no, I don't think so because it declares producing an any plus minus overall</v>

295
00:18:06.291 --> 00:18:07.220
electric charges.

296
00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.620
<v 2>If you told me Brady go and find me an electron, I think I know where to look.</v>

297
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:15.620
You know, if you separately find me a proton or a neutron,

298
00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.870
I know where you said, find me a photon.

299
00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:22.340
They're quite easy to find where are the X seventeens if they exist?

300
00:18:22.341 --> 00:18:23.174
Where are they?

301
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:28.310
<v 0>So the, the, if the, if they're there and that they're there, they're there.</v>

302
00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:33.380
Um, it turns out that they're not in that decay of the beryllium, for example,

303
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:35.420
where remember what I said,

304
00:18:35.421 --> 00:18:38.630
beryllium naturally just to care's back to the lithium. It just breaks up again.

305
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:43.100
There's then, then the next level of decay is via these virtual photons,

306
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:47.120
which then themselves, the decay ins that you plus the minors,

307
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:52.040
one in a million of them roughly would be the production of the X.

308
00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:54.200
<v 2>But that's a rare event. That's delusion.</v>

309
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:58.090
<v 0>So you're going to have to work hard. Right. You're going to say.</v>

310
00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:01.700
<v 2>So right now there's no X seventeens. If they exist right now,</v>

311
00:19:01.701 --> 00:19:03.350
there's no exceptions in you. Yeah.

312
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:08.930
<v 0>Um, I don't, that's a good question. Um, I don't think I'm any, well,</v>

313
00:19:08.931 --> 00:19:12.230
I often am quite excited and I do get excited. I don't know.

314
00:19:12.231 --> 00:19:15.710
I think of an individual, uh, Healy. I mean,

315
00:19:15.711 --> 00:19:19.310
I've got helium in me and I don't think, and I must have some beryllium in me,

316
00:19:19.311 --> 00:19:21.380
I guess, too. I don't think it's that,

317
00:19:21.381 --> 00:19:24.950
that excited energy state that indicates if it does, by the way,

318
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:27.170
it's pretty hard to find.

319
00:19:27.171 --> 00:19:30.170
I think their lifetime is around 10 to the minus 12 seconds.

320
00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.600
So it could have found them that they just disappeared.

321
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:35.750
<v 2>So if particles are excitations of a field,</v>

322
00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.660
including electrons and protons and things like that,

323
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:43.520
how come electrons and protons are so abundant in this room

324
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:47.180
and so long lived. And yet this X 17,

325
00:19:47.181 --> 00:19:49.790
which is heavier than an electron and lighter than a proton,

326
00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:54.170
doesn't have this ability to manifest itself and then hang around.

327
00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.260
<v 0>So that's, that's a, that's a tough question.</v>

328
00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.080
But so the electron is the,

329
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:05.180
so the electromagnetic field is pervading this room and the electrons would be

330
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:06.530
associated with, well,

331
00:20:06.531 --> 00:20:10.610
the photons would be associated with excitations of that as would be the

332
00:20:10.611 --> 00:20:13.730
electrons, which are electromagnetic interactions.

333
00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:19.220
The protons are a bit more unusual that the majority of the mass of the proton

334
00:20:19.221 --> 00:20:23.510
is not in the quarks and the majority of the mass of the proton. I mean, if you,

335
00:20:23.511 --> 00:20:28.280
if you add up the mass of the quarks, each quark is as a rest massive about,

336
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:32.300
um, three MEV. So their total mass is about 10 MEV.

337
00:20:32.301 --> 00:20:36.530
And I've just said the massive a proton is a thousand MEV.

338
00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:41.210
So the majority of the massive process is actually in the binding energy of the,

339
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:44.180
of the, of the quarks of the glue-ons sorry,

340
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:46.940
that that are propagating around it all the,

341
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.580
so it's not quite as straightforward as sort of turning on the quarks and same

342
00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:54.760
day as your prototype. So, but so I think it's it's,

343
00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.700
but it is a case of that, that the,

344
00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:02.620
the relative of excitation in the field is the thing that determines the

345
00:21:02.621 --> 00:21:05.800
underlying, um, uh, massive these objects.

346
00:21:05.801 --> 00:21:09.460
But the proton itself is this combination of the quarks and the glue-ons,

347
00:21:09.461 --> 00:21:13.210
which makes it a bit less clear, how are you going to generate them?

348
00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.430
<v 3>So the X 17 field.</v>

349
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.810
<v 0>That exists is one that just doesn't get excited very often in our world.</v>

350
00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.580
I guess. That's true. I mean, it seems to be the product of the decay of, uh,

351
00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:25.763
an, uh,

352
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:31.030
more excited uh beryllium but you've got me thinking I'm not quite sure because

353
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.310
it's, it doesn't require a huge amount of energy.

354
00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:37.180
These are not massive energy scales compared to what you, what you get.

355
00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:39.770
But I think that the issue is,

356
00:21:39.771 --> 00:21:43.810
is it's not just that it does depend on the interaction, these,

357
00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.970
the ax 17 particles have, what,

358
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:50.590
what type of interactions it has with the other force, other matter particles.

359
00:21:50.591 --> 00:21:53.770
And we've seen that in order to explain its existence,

360
00:21:53.771 --> 00:21:56.440
we have to already do something rather unusual.

361
00:21:56.441 --> 00:21:59.990
We have to make that interaction one that's proton, proton,

362
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:03.490
or phobic in order, which means that it's not interacting,

363
00:22:03.491 --> 00:22:05.350
like the usual particles are interacting.

364
00:22:05.351 --> 00:22:10.180
So that could have an impact on how likely it is to be formed out of some

365
00:22:10.181 --> 00:22:13.840
excitation of the field. Are you an X,

366
00:22:13.841 --> 00:22:18.760
17 skeptic, or I still remain a little bit of an acceptance in skeptic.

367
00:22:18.761 --> 00:22:22.990
Yeah, I think, um, it does require, um, a,

368
00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:27.940
it requires more particle physics explanation for why it's might be

369
00:22:27.941 --> 00:22:32.720
there in, in, uh, in a coherent framework and,

370
00:22:32.721 --> 00:22:34.630
and be above all.

371
00:22:34.631 --> 00:22:39.460
It needs more experimental evidence coming from a similar type of

372
00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:44.350
experiment to verify whether the bump that they're seeing is actual,

373
00:22:44.351 --> 00:22:45.430
real or not.

374
00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:49.380
<v 3>It's absorbed in the air.</v>

375
00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:53.460
So to measure the x-ray absorption of our compound,

376
00:22:53.461 --> 00:22:54.540
which is sensitive to the air,

377
00:22:54.541 --> 00:22:56.790
we need to be able to remove the air and in case it,

378
00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:01.920
so we use beryllium to make a magic box around our sample that the x-rays can

379
00:23:01.921 --> 00:23:02.580
come into.
