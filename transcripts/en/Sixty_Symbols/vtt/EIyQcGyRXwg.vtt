00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.120
<v 0>When I started goop in 2008,</v>

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.940
my calling is something else besides, you know,

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.250
making out with Matt Damon on screen.

4
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.390
<v 1>Coop lab, we are in a science lab here and what we have,</v>

5
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.990
or lots of, as you can see, shiny stainless steel stuff.

6
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.300
And in here we measure force fields.

7
00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:24.230
And in here we manage measure energy fields between individual atoms and between

8
00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:27.020
atoms and molecules. We move atoms and molecules around.

9
00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:30.470
We've done loads of 60 symbols videos and moving out and some molecules around

10
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.500
you. This lab has goes by the incredibly sophisticated,

11
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.460
take off air one or three, nothing more to read into it.

12
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.950
There was no numerology there. It was on my radar.

13
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.100
It's not something I would generally sit down and watch.

14
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.350
But given that this one is all about energy and energy fields and the double

15
00:00:48.351 --> 00:00:51.770
slit experiment has mentioned. And a number of years back,

16
00:00:51.771 --> 00:00:54.890
we did something as you remember, Brady on quantum, Whoa,

17
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.240
I really wanted to take a look and, um, that's what we're going to do now.

18
00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:01.780
We're going to sit down and I'm proud to stand up. And just.

19
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.080
<v 0>Another day, I think the opportunity that we have with the goofy.</v>

20
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.100
<v 1>It looks like a lot of fun, very attractive people doing very attractive thing.</v>

21
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:15.703
<v 0>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.210
<v 1>Okay. The following series is designed to entertain and inform,</v>

23
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.100
not provide medical advice. Okay. Well,

24
00:01:22.101 --> 00:01:23.780
that's a good disclaimer to have up front.

25
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.410
You should always consult your doctor when it comes to your personal health or

26
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.470
before you start any treatment, as both of us know Brady. However,

27
00:01:30.471 --> 00:01:32.720
if you put stuff in the video information on a video,

28
00:01:32.721 --> 00:01:35.540
often the vast majority of times it's ignored.

29
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.430
<v 0>The entire universe is made of energy.</v>

30
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.840
0.6% of the universe is considered physical matter.

31
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.900
<v 1>Okay. So that's actually okay. In terms of the 4.6% of matter,</v>

32
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:48.940
in fact physicist,

33
00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:51.680
I've got a really embarrassing problem in that they don't know what the vast

34
00:01:51.681 --> 00:01:54.710
majority of the universe is made up of in terms of where we are in terms of what

35
00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:58.460
we're doing in terms of what they're doing. Our 4.6% is pretty much everything.

36
00:01:58.461 --> 00:01:59.420
So let's.

37
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.360
<v 0>The human body as an energy field.</v>

38
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.930
<v 1>Okay. What type of energy are we talking? Kinetic energy,</v>

39
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.010
electromagnetic energy, acoustic energy, um, potential energy.

40
00:02:13.011 --> 00:02:16.820
What type of energy? This is, this is already beginning to wind me up.

41
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.810
<v 0>Because the more connected you are energetically, you will feel.</v>

42
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.000
<v 1>So it's the same old tropes and the same old means.</v>

43
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.170
So that idea of everything being one integrated whole and how we're all

44
00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:31.790
connected, energetically, et cetera.

45
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.550
<v 0>I believe that 20% is the age of energy.</v>

46
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.830
<v 1>Okay. Every century is basically the edge of energy.</v>

47
00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:39.110
Energy drives pretty much everything.

48
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.280
What I don't want to do for a change is come across as

49
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.210
absolutely and utterly, well, this is just nonsense. And that the,

50
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.940
the informed scientists ridiculed in everything,

51
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.990
if there's a placebo element of this, if there's a therapeutic element of this,

52
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.440
perhaps you could argue from that perspective that some of this might have some

53
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:01.120
value, but let's, let's see where it goes.

54
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.290
<v 2>Okay, this is bomb push.</v>

55
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.000
<v 1>Okay. We can't let that one go. I had an exorcism.</v>

56
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.330
If we're talking about exorcisms, this pops might not be the most educational,

57
00:03:21.331 --> 00:03:25.320
but let's go. When it got to the titles, when more off.

58
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.310
<v 0>I work with energy as a body worker and a chiropractor, you have energy.</v>

59
00:03:29.311 --> 00:03:34.170
That's bound up in the muscles and ligaments and spine and fascia and organs

60
00:03:34.171 --> 00:03:35.460
when you're under stress.

61
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.790
So I show up and actually influence how energy is moving.

62
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.730
<v 1>Okay. So energy is a really important concept in physics and energy.</v>

63
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.060
Very broadly speaking is the ability to do work,

64
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.820
but it comes in so many different forms. And to a certain extent,

65
00:03:47.821 --> 00:03:49.710
what he's saying, the first part of that is right,

66
00:03:49.711 --> 00:03:53.280
in terms of biochemical energy in your body in terms of your muscles is

67
00:03:53.281 --> 00:03:55.470
mechanical energy and biomechanical energy there.

68
00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.330
But how has he influenced them that energy? That's, that's the question.

69
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.070
<v 2>It's possible that some of the problem though,</v>

70
00:04:02.071 --> 00:04:06.150
is just like misappropriation of the word. Like if they're,

71
00:04:06.151 --> 00:04:07.860
if they're talking about something different,

72
00:04:07.861 --> 00:04:11.790
but they're calling it energy and you're getting all wound up, like, is that,

73
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.210
is, that is all the problem possibly tracked back to that.

74
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.220
<v 1>I think all the problems tracks back to that,</v>

75
00:04:17.221 --> 00:04:20.820
certainly what I've read online about this that's all of the problems is not

76
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.120
tripod. That's a really, really good point. Brady,

77
00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:27.870
let me just pick something up. Can I put this down? Is that okay for a second?

78
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.660
Okay. No work has been done on this particular body.

79
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.980
I've lifted it up against gravity. I've returned it to the same position.

80
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.540
So no network has been done on this particular body. Of course, I've, you know,

81
00:04:42.541 --> 00:04:45.990
my muscles have had to do various things and there's been energy expended there,

82
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.090
but we have to be really,

83
00:04:48.091 --> 00:04:52.050
really careful how we define different terms for a physicist

84
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.600
in a professional context,

85
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.760
work is the dark product of the force and displacement factors are the

86
00:04:59.761 --> 00:05:02.580
integral of the dot product of the force and displacement factors.

87
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.530
That's obviously not what it's, you know,

88
00:05:04.531 --> 00:05:06.270
if I say you've been working nine to five early,

89
00:05:06.271 --> 00:05:09.540
that's obviously not what brings to mind. So yes,

90
00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:10.890
we have to be careful with language,

91
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.750
but the problem is we physicists have to take some of the blame

92
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.300
because we import everyday language.

93
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.430
It's not just the people out there who aren't physicists misinterpreting this.

94
00:05:23.431 --> 00:05:28.080
I would say we are very guilty in propagating quite a lot of quantum world.

95
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.850
And let's see where this goes.

96
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.590
<v 0>So I show up and actually influence how energy is moving so that your body can</v>

97
00:05:34.591 --> 00:05:39.150
heal faster than your physical being your emotional, being your mind, your soul.

98
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.100
<v 1>Just go.</v>

99
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.340
I have to stop at that point because this is meant to be what I dislike is the

100
00:05:44.341 --> 00:05:47.850
goop lab. So there's a scientific Shane forgetting about that, disclaimer,

101
00:05:47.851 --> 00:05:48.271
at the start.

102
00:05:48.271 --> 00:05:51.120
And I don't think that disclaimer is really going to impact too heavily on

103
00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:55.290
people. And now we're talking about the soul within a scientific context.

104
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.030
<v 0>Okay. Not treating a particular condition when I'm working with people,</v>

105
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:00.350
but I have a hypothesis.

106
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.180
If you just change the frequency of vibration of the body itself and changes the

107
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:06.014
way the cells.

108
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.710
<v 1>I do, I have to stop it there. What,</v>

109
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.920
what the hell do we mean by frequency of vibration? What sort of,

110
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.820
I sort of push myself forward, push Brady, you know, does he, what, what,

111
00:06:15.821 --> 00:06:17.770
what do we, what frequency of vibration.

112
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.310
<v 2>But.</v>

113
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.900
<v 1>You know, what is this? And again, this is, um, importing just as you said,</v>

114
00:06:25.901 --> 00:06:29.980
Brady, this is importing particular language of physics and misinterpreting,

115
00:06:29.981 --> 00:06:33.070
not in an everyday context. Of course,

116
00:06:33.071 --> 00:06:35.530
we talk about frequency in physics.

117
00:06:35.531 --> 00:06:39.520
So much quantum physics, right at the heart of quantum physics.

118
00:06:39.521 --> 00:06:41.020
We've got a very simple equation,

119
00:06:41.021 --> 00:06:45.760
which is equally here to new or hitch F does a direct relationship

120
00:06:45.761 --> 00:06:47.290
between energy and frequency.

121
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.470
But the problem is that's then coached in terms of where you're on the same

122
00:06:50.471 --> 00:06:54.340
frequency as me and, you know, very, very everyday,

123
00:06:54.341 --> 00:06:58.270
almost one day in language. And when we start to mix these terms,

124
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.770
that's when it gets dangerous just before he started talking about the soul. My,

125
00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.600
my concern is that when he's,

126
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.580
he seems to be coaching this as a valid medical process.

127
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.840
<v 2>You said yourself, you know,</v>

128
00:07:10.841 --> 00:07:13.390
you can come to work and have a talk about frequency,

129
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.470
and then you can go home and talk to your loved ones and use frequency in a

130
00:07:17.471 --> 00:07:21.010
different context. And that's not a problem. So why are you calling him on it?

131
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.770
<v 1>Because he's catching this in a scientific context,</v>

132
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.040
whether he's doing that deliberately and whether Paltrow was doing it

133
00:07:27.041 --> 00:07:29.860
deliberately, I don't know that stuff, that part of the, you know,

134
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:34.000
what's out there and Paltrow, I think she believes this stuff, that guy,

135
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.690
in terms of what he's doing, does he really believe he's affecting people?

136
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.740
Maybe he does.

137
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.090
Is he doing this deliberately is using that language deliberately to put that

138
00:07:43.091 --> 00:07:46.390
scientific sheen on or does he just genuinely believe that? I don't know.

139
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.220
<v 0>It's like magnet therapy, laser therapy, light therapy, vibrational therapy,</v>

140
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.450
and how they're manipulating the energetic field of a person to heal or break up

141
00:07:55.451 --> 00:07:56.470
tissue, et cetera.

142
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.800
<v 1>I just, the energetic theme. They've never defined it.</v>

143
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.210
<v 0>Hesitant to show it just because it, it can look strange,</v>

144
00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:06.700
but I think it's time for the world to see

145
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.890
it, to measure the energy field of the body.

146
00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:13.540
Like somewhere between four and six feet off.

147
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:18.130
<v 1>No, no, you cannot. No, you cannot. No, you cannot. That is just.</v>

148
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.200
<v 2>License show that you are giving off warmth.</v>

149
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:24.100
<v 1>And infrared radiation. But in terms of influencing notch,</v>

150
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.290
to that extent where the body's doing this,

151
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.700
that's an energy field he claims to be influencing so that he can control

152
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:35.110
emotional responses to that extent via infrared. But he,

153
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.530
if he'd mentioned infrared at some point, that might be useful,

154
00:08:38.531 --> 00:08:41.200
but what is that energy field?

155
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.660
<v 2>Is it possible? You just don't know. And he's,</v>

156
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:47.320
he has found something and he's able to manipulate something that you just don't

157
00:08:47.321 --> 00:08:48.154
understand.

158
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.490
<v 1>Yeah. So let's say, um, okay, that's his theory. I've got my theory.</v>

159
00:08:51.491 --> 00:08:56.190
Let's say all human emotions are coached in

160
00:08:56.191 --> 00:09:00.630
terms of, um, completely undetectable. Nanoscopic rings of energy.

161
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.390
Let's put it that way. It's made of chlorine something like medical Koreans,

162
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:04.500
but they exist out there.

163
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.760
And let's say that love let's wind in some good physics. Terminology.

164
00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:11.400
Love is due to the constructive interference of those rings.

165
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.030
And here it is due to the district of influence interference with all things

166
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.800
they've not been detected yet.

167
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.000
And actually the energy scale is such that we just could never detect them,

168
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.410
prove me wrong. Definitively proved me wrong.

169
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.230
<v 2>But he's got people. He has got people wobbling around. He's got people saying,</v>

170
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.143
I feel better. Yeah.

171
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:35.690
<v 1>So we need empirical evidence because the placebo effect is exceptionally</v>

172
00:09:35.691 --> 00:09:39.260
strong. We do trails of drugs. What we build in the placebo effect.

173
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.560
This is a combination of placebo effect. Culture.

174
00:09:42.561 --> 00:09:46.430
Personality is a fairly attractive and charismatic guy, I would say. Um,

175
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:51.380
and he's clearly very eloquent and he's clearly,

176
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.210
um, got people hanging off. His,

177
00:09:53.211 --> 00:09:56.570
every word does a huge number of confounding variables here.

178
00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:01.790
<v 0>The body doesn't end right here at this kid and the body is multi-dimensional.</v>

179
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:03.590
There are layers to it.

180
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.670
<v 1>Multi-dimension in what sense, honestly, that's a word that's.</v>

181
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.430
<v 0>And I'm interacting with those layers.</v>

182
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:17.780
So when I'm moving my hands in the air and I'm snapping my fingers and I'm

183
00:10:17.781 --> 00:10:21.860
making sounds with my hands, I'm putting energy into the field,

184
00:10:21.861 --> 00:10:25.550
around some of these body and I'm changing their energy system just by the way I

185
00:10:25.551 --> 00:10:26.384
interact with it.

186
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:31.010
The way we interact with someone without even touching them at the subatomic

187
00:10:31.011 --> 00:10:32.540
level, changes them so much.

188
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.320
<v 2>No, I've got to stop now. And he is definitely getting it.</v>

189
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.060
<v 1>Right? So, so he said,</v>

190
00:10:38.061 --> 00:10:42.860
he's influencing the person at the soap atomic level by clicking his

191
00:10:42.861 --> 00:10:46.040
fingers. If we could influence motto at the sober atomic level,

192
00:10:46.041 --> 00:10:48.500
by clicking our fingers, we wouldn't have to spend billions on CERN.

193
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.320
We wouldn't have to, and we wouldn't need this bloody thing.

194
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:56.960
Not that this is just nonsense. This really is just nonsense. And you know,

195
00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.590
the argument will be made well, science doesn't know everything.

196
00:11:00.591 --> 00:11:04.100
So how do you know? Sure. Science doesn't know everything.

197
00:11:04.101 --> 00:11:06.410
If science knew everything I'd be out of a job,

198
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.080
Brady would be out of a job because everything would be out there,

199
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.790
but science knows some things.

200
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:14.510
And the way that science works is that we have to have empirical measurements

201
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.110
and we have to have evidence if we don't have evidence and you know,

202
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.580
physicists are pretty bad.

203
00:11:19.581 --> 00:11:23.360
I am no fan of the multi-verse because what ex what empirical evidence have we

204
00:11:23.361 --> 00:11:27.860
got for the multi-verse hypothesis? Zilch is what this guy is doing.

205
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:28.850
You know,

206
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.970
aligned with that to a certain extent in that he's proposing something with no

207
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.170
one periodical evidence. It is.

208
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:37.370
So I will stress that we really don't want to come across as physicist on his

209
00:11:37.371 --> 00:11:41.600
high horse, you know, spouts off by new age.

210
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.033
Woostoff the way I'm doing now.

211
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.260
But we physicists do have to take some of the blame.

212
00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:51.470
<v 2>Phil science works by collecting evidence and having a hypothesis and working</v>

213
00:11:51.471 --> 00:11:55.570
through these different procedures, but that that's not how nature works.

214
00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:59.620
So for example, I don't know how my car works,

215
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.530
but I know when I press the accelerator, it drives.

216
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.480
Is it possible that you don't know?

217
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:08.860
And even he doesn't know how the human body energy field works,

218
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.000
but he's just stumbled across the fact that when he clicks his fingers at a

219
00:12:13.001 --> 00:12:15.310
certain location, it cures people,

220
00:12:15.311 --> 00:12:18.760
just like I know when I press the accelerator, the car works. I don't know why,

221
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:19.690
but I know it does.

222
00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:24.060
<v 1>Is this repeatable. If we do this under, um,</v>

223
00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:28.440
controlled experimental conditions, can he do this?

224
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.560
So for one thing, I would love to say, he's talking his way through.

225
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.720
You can hit the hands are clicking around.

226
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.720
What if we were to put a blindfold on people and whatever we put our headphones

227
00:12:36.721 --> 00:12:40.530
on and do it in an entirely darkened room. He says, it works up to six,

228
00:12:40.531 --> 00:12:42.960
six feet away. I think somewhere between three and six feet away,

229
00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.750
completely isolate the person.

230
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:49.410
Don't give them any hints as to where his hands are or what he's doing.

231
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.210
And let's then see what the emotions are.

232
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.300
<v 2>Maybe it works because it's him, maybe,</v>

233
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:59.250
maybe his quantum energy field chakra is what makes it

234
00:12:59.251 --> 00:13:02.550
work. And therefore it's not repeatable by you because you haven't,

235
00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:03.773
you're not here.

236
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:04.560
<v 1>Can use him.</v>

237
00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:08.340
The question is let's cut out external stimuli and see if this still works.

238
00:13:08.341 --> 00:13:12.600
Let's see if they're doing all this motion or that is solely due to

239
00:13:12.601 --> 00:13:16.290
suggestion and the placebo. And we know how strong the placebo effect.

240
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.950
<v 0>There's been some amazing research done in the realm of quantum physics to</v>

241
00:13:19.951 --> 00:13:24.660
support this one foundational study is called the double slit experiment

242
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:30.120
proved apparently without a shadow of a doubt that our consciousness actually

243
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:33.960
shifts or altars in some way, shape or form physical reality.

244
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.680
<v 1>Right? Does. Sorry, but that is.</v>

245
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:42.090
The idea that you might have to bleep a lot, but really,

246
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:44.730
truly utterly complete.

247
00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:49.620
The man is talking out of his nether regions that has not been empirically

248
00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:53.400
proved beyond a shadow of a doubt. So irritating the infrastructure tingly.

249
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.160
Some scientists have actually have claimed this.

250
00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.940
Some very important businesses include Ning Heisenberg himself,

251
00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:04.260
but we don't have that evidence. We do not. That evidence is not there.

252
00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:06.180
There are probably at last count,

253
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:10.920
something like 25 different theories of quantum mechanics and there's no or

254
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:12.480
interpretations of quantum mechanics.

255
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.920
And there's no empirical evidence that definitively says this one is important

256
00:14:16.921 --> 00:14:19.890
over this one is information important. Yes,

257
00:14:19.891 --> 00:14:24.480
it seems to be is knowing the trajectories of particles

258
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.800
and how that plays into a norm, the history of particles and indeed,

259
00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:32.550
even future particles. Does all of that plant or quantum mechanics? Yes.

260
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.200
Do we understand the math? Yes.

261
00:14:34.201 --> 00:14:37.950
Can we do incredibly sophisticated calculations and predict what happens in the

262
00:14:37.951 --> 00:14:41.340
real world? Yes. Do we understand it? No.

263
00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:46.620
And physicist re what really winds me up is when physicist presents

264
00:14:46.621 --> 00:14:50.250
something as sort of a theater complex, and this happens all the time,

265
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.430
particularly know things like many worlds,

266
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.760
that's one interpretation of quantum mechanics. Multi-verse,

267
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:59.480
that's one interpretation of physics in terms of empirical evidence for either

268
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.970
none doesn't mean we can't talk about it.

269
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.030
Does it absolutely doesn't mean we can't talk about it. And the thing is,

270
00:15:05.031 --> 00:15:07.130
I'm going to cut this guy, some Slack here for a change,

271
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:11.870
because when you have physicists of the caliber of Heisenberg,

272
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.310
indeed Martin Reese,

273
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:18.770
Mirman those type of people basically saying without any

274
00:15:18.771 --> 00:15:22.760
real qualification, yes. Consciousness is so important for quantum mechanics.

275
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.290
Can you blame this guy?

276
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:28.730
Or can you blame people like Deepak Chopra and the unalike for taking this on

277
00:15:28.731 --> 00:15:32.510
board? And, you know, as I say,

278
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:37.130
we physicists really are sort of propagating our own little Quanta of womb.

279
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:41.690
Every time we get up and we don't make it really, really clear, actually,

280
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.430
we don't fully understand this.

281
00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.110
<v 0>Degenerate the way you're moving through the spine to try to manipulate the flow</v>

282
00:15:47.111 --> 00:15:50.500
of information between the brain nervous system and muscles. This.

283
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.370
<v 1>I know I'm interrupting a lot, but this suspicious, really the crux of this,</v>

284
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:59.320
how is he doing that really? How is he doing that? And you know, if we were to.

285
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.020
<v 2>Do you belong, walk in here and I don't know how you're doing stuff,</v>

286
00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:06.190
but I believe you're doing it. You tell me, you tell me that in that machine,

287
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.500
you've manipulated atoms and you've moved them.

288
00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.830
And you show me a picture on a screen, but I don't know you did it.

289
00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:15.130
<v 1>You could sit here and you could watch every single step of that process,</v>

290
00:16:15.131 --> 00:16:15.964
in fact.

291
00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.550
<v 2>But he's doing that. He's letting us watch his process.</v>

292
00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:20.320
<v 1>So what what's not,</v>

293
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:25.030
but I can show you exactly from the point of here's how we measure the current.

294
00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:27.790
This is the instrument we use to measure the current.

295
00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:32.290
<v 2>The way I do it is I move my hand here and I feel an energy here. And I,</v>

296
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:33.850
and I click my fingers.

297
00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.720
<v 1>Energy, and how was the influence on it? But you know, you do know,</v>

298
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.570
cause I've bored. You've sensed that.

299
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:43.000
<v 2>It's happening, but I don't know that it's happening, but I can.</v>

300
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.540
<v 1>Show you that current, I can show you that measurement. We can,</v>

301
00:16:46.541 --> 00:16:49.270
we can get a meter and we can see that current okay.

302
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.030
<v 2>Balanced, but I'm watching him move his hand.</v>

303
00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.840
And then I'm seeing the people on the bed go and move around and have their

304
00:16:55.841 --> 00:16:57.970
little exorcism and like,

305
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.600
and there were multiple explanations for it.

306
00:17:01.601 --> 00:17:03.130
But you can't say that he hasn't shown it.

307
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:08.530
<v 1>If I go I'm influenced in my quantum fields.</v>

308
00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:09.910
Ready? Do you believe me?

309
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.540
<v 2>No, I personally don't.</v>

310
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.600
<v 1>So what's the difference between me and him apart from he's much more attractive</v>

311
00:17:16.601 --> 00:17:17.434
as much more hair.

312
00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:22.420
<v 0>I think everybody at Duke knows me to be a bit of a skeptic skeptic.</v>

313
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:27.100
A lot of people's emotional energy gets bound up the tip of the tailbone.

314
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.050
<v 1>Okay. That's a really great example. No, that,</v>

315
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:30.790
there's a really what we were talking about earlier, Brady,

316
00:17:30.791 --> 00:17:35.320
in terms of energy being used in this sense of positive and negative emotional

317
00:17:35.321 --> 00:17:38.410
energy as compared to a physical entity,

318
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:42.670
that that's a real issue here in terms of confusing those two contexts,

319
00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:46.270
very different contexts in terms of semantics. It's not,

320
00:17:46.271 --> 00:17:47.590
it's not in this context where he's,

321
00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:52.560
he's arguing that he's to make people feel better by changing their energy

322
00:17:52.561 --> 00:17:53.160
fields.

323
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.910
So there's a question of the physical energy field being confused for the

324
00:17:56.911 --> 00:17:59.220
emotional energy. But.

325
00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:03.050
<v 2>If you said, Oh, we've just got a new member in our research group.</v>

326
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.600
And like she's giving off really good energy.

327
00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:08.210
I think she's going to be really good. I wouldn't sit there and go, Oh,

328
00:18:08.211 --> 00:18:10.470
do you mean kinetic energy or electric?

329
00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.830
<v 1>No, neither would we all stereotypes of folk physicists to one side,</v>

330
00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:20.030
but we wouldn't be claiming to be able to stand beside or three feet away and

331
00:18:20.031 --> 00:18:22.250
influence our energy and soul change our state of mind,

332
00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.420
which is what he's claiming.

333
00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:27.950
This is where a controlled study whereby she's got some headphones on and she's

334
00:18:27.951 --> 00:18:30.910
listening to them some nice relaxing music, unexplained folder,

335
00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:32.270
and it's completely in the dark.

336
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:34.670
I would like to see if the reactions would be the same.

337
00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.550
<v 2>But feel maybe that external stimuli,</v>

338
00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.290
the handsome man with the nice hair and the nice voice maybe that is

339
00:18:42.291 --> 00:18:46.760
contributing to this cocktail of physical things that are

340
00:18:46.761 --> 00:18:48.230
happening that make it work.

341
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.290
<v 1>Maybe it's the only thing. And how would we do that? I would,</v>

342
00:18:51.291 --> 00:18:52.850
we isolate one effect from the other.

343
00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.480
We do a controlled study where you try to control the variables in the

344
00:18:56.481 --> 00:18:57.314
environment.

345
00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:58.580
<v 3>There was that stress.</v>

346
00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:05.450
<v 2>I don't trust anyone that wears all black outfit like that.</v>

347
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:07.700
<v 1>Yeah. I'll give him that.</v>

348
00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:12.110
I will give him that the man has got a key sense of style and

349
00:19:12.111 --> 00:19:14.360
sartorial elegance. It's gotta be said. And look at that.

350
00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.240
<v 2>How do you feel about this being made and put out there?</v>

351
00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.030
<v 1>That's a really good question. Really good question. Um,</v>

352
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.070
am I worried about it?

353
00:19:25.071 --> 00:19:29.870
I am worried about it in terms of disseminating that type of it's

354
00:19:29.871 --> 00:19:32.720
nonsense. You know, it really is no scientific basis.

355
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.680
They've got the disclaimer or fluent front for all of 10 seconds. You know,

356
00:19:36.681 --> 00:19:40.610
you've got that simple writing on a black background or whatever against

357
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:44.390
incredibly attractive people. You know, being, you know,

358
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.960
saying my life has been radically changed, you know, one is or where the other,

359
00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.260
if it's a therapy, if that's all it is,

360
00:19:51.261 --> 00:19:55.700
is a therapy and it's a placebo and people are coming out of those sessions.

361
00:19:55.701 --> 00:19:59.510
And if you offend someone about an I, I'm not gonna argue with that. You know,

362
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.300
religion plays that role in many people's lives as well.

363
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:07.250
My key concern is particularly when this is pushed as a medical

364
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:12.530
procedure, when it will treat cancer or treat other forms of disease.

365
00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.140
That's when I got really, really scared.

366
00:20:15.141 --> 00:20:18.650
And actually we need to regulate this time. Should this be on Netflix?

367
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.440
This should, it comes back to the question of balance. I would say,

368
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.320
um, they can present the aspects of this,

369
00:20:27.321 --> 00:20:30.860
but the really should be a counterbalance in this. They pretty got pretty,

370
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:35.090
what's got free ran in terms of what they present the should be physicists.

371
00:20:35.091 --> 00:20:38.030
The should be doctors. There should be chemists.

372
00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:41.660
There should be whatever right across the board saying, no, this is wrong.

373
00:20:41.661 --> 00:20:44.600
This doesn't work. Explain this, explain this just as we're doing now,

374
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.740
we shouldn't have to rely on 60 symbols to, to, you know,

375
00:20:47.741 --> 00:20:52.240
take this to pieces that should happen in the process itself. But of course,

376
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.550
you know, is that going to is a fully balanced documentary like that,

377
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:02.140
going to attract any like anything like the attention this is attracted. No,

378
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:06.340
of course now where is the evidence that what he's doing works,

379
00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.540
there's no evidence at all.

380
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:11.830
We've seen some people moving around the very first step in that as a controlled

381
00:21:11.831 --> 00:21:16.600
experiment where you caught out his visual and his audible cues and

382
00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:20.110
do a perfectly controlled experiment and then see how those people behave.

383
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:21.820
And if honestly,

384
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:26.140
if they do that experiment and where people have headphones on and blindfolds on

385
00:21:26.141 --> 00:21:29.980
in a darkened room and they move and they have no cue at all as to where his

386
00:21:29.981 --> 00:21:33.250
hands are and his entrance, I would be over the moon. Oh my,

387
00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:35.890
that would like revolution attack. I will get a Nobel prize.

388
00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:39.300
Let's put it this way. I'm not going to bet the bloody house it's on it.

389
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:42.930
That that's going to happen maybe in the sixties.

390
00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:47.280
And what it does is it connects new air J ideas,

391
00:21:47.281 --> 00:21:51.150
sort of Eastern mysticism with quantum mechanics and quantum physics.

392
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.590
The idea that, you know,

393
00:21:52.591 --> 00:21:56.070
quantum physics means that there's an interconnectedness to all things and

394
00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:59.100
Withers and universal spirit, et cetera, all these type of things.
