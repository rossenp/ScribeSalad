00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.770
<v 0>I love maps and I love mountains and I love being on</v>

2
00:00:04.771 --> 00:00:07.650
mountains with a map. So I read with some alarm,

3
00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:10.710
a warning from the Scottish mountaineering association,

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.720
telling people to be careful about how they store them campuses.

5
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.260
We carry a lot more magnets right around than we used to,

6
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.040
and that can get you into trouble. It can deflect the needle of your compass,

7
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.220
or in some cases it can reverse the polarity altogether.

8
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.600
So got the trusty compass here, lots of surprising things have magnets in them,

9
00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:31.550
anything with a speaker in it has a magnet.

10
00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:34.970
And you can see just by waving the phone nearby the compass,

11
00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:36.200
you can deflect the needle.

12
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.060
And so if you inadvertently have a magnet in your sleeve or as a fastening,

13
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.840
when your phone and your, you have anywhere near your compass,

14
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.580
you can get pointed in the wrong direction.

15
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.780
And if you store this compass for a long time next to something with a strong

16
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.200
magnet, you could actually reverse the polarity of the compass needle.

17
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.120
But this sort of opened the flood Gates into learning a bit about the

18
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.630
Earth's magnetic field as a whole astronomers don't know a lot about magnetic

19
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.970
fields. It's a running joke that at a conference,

20
00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:07.370
if someone can't think of a question to ask, they ask,

21
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.280
have you considered magnetic fields? So no,

22
00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:13.520
I would not count myself as an expert on magnetic fields.

23
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.520
If you're going out in the Hills and you're going to rely on a compass,

24
00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:20.930
which is a good thing to do, because even if you have a GPS on your phone,

25
00:01:20.931 --> 00:01:23.420
which isn't going to be using the ears magnetic field,

26
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.490
you never know when that might conk out.

27
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.420
So if you ever look closely at a topological map,

28
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.770
like the ones I've got here,

29
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.450
you see in the corner often a little diagram that says, Hey,

30
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.920
be careful here.

31
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.630
What you think of as normal on this map might not match what your compass is.

32
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.280
This is telling you the direction that the compass points is not

33
00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:50.630
necessarily almost never exactly at the true North,

34
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.620
towards the North pole. And so on every corner of every map,

35
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.730
you'll see a little correction that tells you how much you have to correct your

36
00:01:58.731 --> 00:02:03.440
bearings for this particular point on the earth. Yeah.

37
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.400
I can't say that myself I've ever been reliant on that level of detail in my

38
00:02:07.401 --> 00:02:08.300
navigation

39
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.570
plus here in the UK, the deflections are fairly small.

40
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.950
So here you can see three degrees correction East of North,

41
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.150
but in some places,

42
00:02:20.151 --> 00:02:23.660
particularly near the magnetic North pole in the North of Canada,

43
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.860
you can be up by 40 degrees and you definitely don't want to be relying on your

44
00:02:27.861 --> 00:02:30.350
compass without correcting it in that case.

45
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.110
So there are multiple poles on the earth.

46
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.070
There's what we think of as the North pole, you know, where Santa lives,

47
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.090
and this is, this is associated with the rotator patient of the earth.

48
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.830
The earth is spinning on its axis.

49
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.530
That access is actually tilted with respect to the sun,

50
00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:48.380
but we won't worry about that today. So the earth is spinning on the axis,

51
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.190
the axis,

52
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.450
the rotation goes up through the surface of the earth and subject to some

53
00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:57.200
caveats I'm not going to talk about in this video is more or less what we call

54
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.790
the, the geographic North pole that, that the, the maps point to that's.

55
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.890
<v 1>Pretty much where your finger and thumb are.</v>

56
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.080
<v 0>Yeah, right, right. About there. Yeah.</v>

57
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.440
<v 1>Where the pins would go into a globe and.</v>

58
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.290
<v 0>The pins would go in the globe.</v>

59
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.060
But how would a compass needle know to point at the geographic North or South

60
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:14.140
pole? In fact,

61
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:18.610
they don't the magnetic North pole and the magnetic South pole that our compass

62
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.820
is points. Wards are actually in a different place altogether.

63
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.480
And in fact that place actually moves. So to understand what's going on here,

64
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:29.620
you really have to understand how the magnetic field of the earth is formed in

65
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:32.200
the first place. Unfortunately, we don't really know,

66
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.900
at least not in the details, it gets very complicated.

67
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.910
But what we do know is that the structure of the interior of the earth has at

68
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.530
its core, just like this plum does a very solid core of solid iron.

69
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.270
And that's surrounded by a sea of liquid iron.

70
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.990
And that makes up about half of the Earth's interior.

71
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.100
So about 3000 kilometers in radius from the center.

72
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.360
And it's this molten iron core that we think is

73
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.300
generating and keeping this magnetic field.

74
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.150
<v 1>Why would the fact that there's liquid metal suddenly say, alright,</v>

75
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.560
well then you can have a magnetic field.

76
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.330
<v 0>So now we enter the very complicated field of Magneto</v>

77
00:04:15.331 --> 00:04:20.130
hydrodynamics, where you're putting together equations from fluid dynamics,

78
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.000
like the NAVAIR Stokes equation. And you're pulling together, you know,

79
00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:28.650
the core equations, Maxwell's equations from electromagnetism,

80
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.570
and you put them all together and you try to understand how the behavior of a

81
00:04:33.571 --> 00:04:37.170
conducting fluid in motion through a magnetic field,

82
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.800
what the effects of that will be. So to produce the Earth's magnetic field,

83
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.420
you need three things. First, you need a conducting liquid.

84
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.470
Do you need that liquid to be in motion and not just chaotic motion,

85
00:04:49.471 --> 00:04:51.900
but fairly ordered flows.

86
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.730
And you get that from two processes first convection. Uh, so the,

87
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.320
the core of the earth is extremely hot and so much like Elavil lamp,

88
00:05:01.321 --> 00:05:04.590
it cycles through, up and down and up and down and circulates,

89
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.820
but then it gets complicated because it's also rotating because of the rotation

90
00:05:08.821 --> 00:05:09.654
of the earth.

91
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.860
And so this sets up some very complicated flow patterns.

92
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.000
And then the third really important ingredient you need is a seed magnetic

93
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.410
field. So something has to be there to start with. And once you've got that,

94
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.230
you have a magnetic induction.

95
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.660
So you've got a conductive fluid moving across these magnetic

96
00:05:30.661 --> 00:05:33.180
field lines in this ordered flow.

97
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.110
And when you have a conducting fluid moving across magnetic field lines,

98
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.360
you generate electrical currents,

99
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.350
those electrical currents in turn generate magnetic field lines.

100
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.480
And so you have this self perpetuating system without the motions of the fluid

101
00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:52.560
across these magnetic field lines that we would expect the magnetic field to

102
00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:56.670
just decay away in about 15,000 years. So,

103
00:05:56.671 --> 00:06:00.500
but we it's been there for, for many, many geological timescales.

104
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.150
You can think of the magnetic field of the earth in a very simple

105
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:09.680
approximation, like a giant bar magnet. And we call that a dipole.

106
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:12.590
So it's got the North and the South magnetic poles,

107
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.710
and then you've got these magnetic field lines that come out and around and

108
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:18.920
connect them. And so that's the simple approximation.

109
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.020
And if you drew a line through that,

110
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.920
you get to what we call the geo magnetic North and South pole,

111
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.870
which are exactly opposite. Each other.

112
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.610
The GM magnetic North pole is located slightly off the coast of Greenland.

113
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.620
And that's where you see all of the Aurora and more than lights centered on

114
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.573
that.

115
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.093
<v 2>Okay.</v>

116
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.420
<v 0>But what we care about with our compass is the magnetic North pole.</v>

117
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.520
And that has a very practical definition. That's the point on the earth surface,

118
00:06:54.521 --> 00:06:56.290
where if you're carrying a compass,

119
00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.070
and if you allow that compass needle to tilt in all directions,

120
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.290
you stood over the magnetic North pole,

121
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.040
the compass needle would point straight down. And that's what we call North.

122
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.023
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

123
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.190
<v 3>So when I'm walking around England,</v>

124
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.310
my needle's not like perfectly flat. It's actually always tilting slightly down.

125
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.250
<v 0>It's always tilting slightly down and it's not necessarily pointing straight to</v>

126
00:07:24.251 --> 00:07:25.540
the magnetic North pole.

127
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.900
It's following whatever the local magnetic field lines are,

128
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.710
which are actually quite complicated. So I've got this map here,

129
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.040
which shows you the world magnetic field model.

130
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:40.660
This is essentially how much you have to correct your compass bearing

131
00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:43.990
by depending on where you are on the surface of the earth.

132
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.570
So if you're anywhere near the green line, you're doing okay.

133
00:07:46.571 --> 00:07:47.710
And that's where we are up here.

134
00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:52.300
We only have a deflection called the declination of a few degrees elsewhere.

135
00:07:52.301 --> 00:07:55.270
You can get up to 10, 20, 30 degrees,

136
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:59.860
and that it's not necessarily in a nice North and South pattern in line with,

137
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:01.510
you know, lines of longitude.

138
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.990
It gets really messy and even more interesting.

139
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:10.150
The magnetic North pole is not directly opposite the magnetic South pole

140
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:14.230
either. It gets really, really weird on different parts of the earth.

141
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:18.850
So I can show you a map of what's called the magnetic anomaly.

142
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.210
You can note one interesting place, which is in here.

143
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.720
This is the Central African Republic of a place called Bungie,

144
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.360
miss the site of the Bungie magnetic anomaly.

145
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.750
And it's a place where you would have no luck with your compass.

146
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:35.110
It would just be pointing all over the place because the magnetic,

147
00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:37.600
the local magnetic field, they're just going.

148
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:38.530
<v 3>What's weird.</v>

149
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.860
Is that in terms of like there's a bunch of mountains with metal in it,

150
00:08:41.861 --> 00:08:46.570
or the actual fundamental core created magnetic field is going weird on us.

151
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.970
<v 0>We don't know these that cause of the anomaly.</v>

152
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.590
It's probably some combination of crust and mantle

153
00:08:53.591 --> 00:08:54.640
interaction.

154
00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:59.490
Either igneous extrusion material from the mantle has come up and solidified or

155
00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:03.900
perhaps an impact from a meteor, right. Has, has done something to the crust,

156
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:08.490
but something there locally makes the magnetic field a bit wonky.

157
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.400
<v 3>Do we know why the way that the magnetic poles turned</v>

158
00:09:13.401 --> 00:09:18.140
out is so non aligned with the geographic poles,

159
00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:22.280
it would seem intuitive that the spinning liquid and everything that's going on

160
00:09:22.281 --> 00:09:25.130
would kind of roughly line up with the rotation of the earth.

161
00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.710
<v 0>I mean, it does. I mean, when you think about it,</v>

162
00:09:27.711 --> 00:09:30.020
they are pretty close to the North and South pole.

163
00:09:30.021 --> 00:09:32.750
We're only talking 10 degrees apart. And in fact,

164
00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:37.460
that's predictable by what we know about fluid dynamics is that the fluid in a

165
00:09:37.461 --> 00:09:42.350
rotating system will set up sort of these columns aligned with the spin axis.

166
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:47.060
But what gets really interesting is to know that the magnetic North pole isn't

167
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:50.060
even stable. In fact, it moves around,

168
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.510
we've known it moves around for quite a long time. Um,

169
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.660
but it's moving faster these days it's accelerating.

170
00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.980
So it used to be that the magnetic North pole was somewhere in the North of

171
00:10:00.981 --> 00:10:04.670
Canada in the territory that we now call the Nunavut territory,

172
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:09.380
but it's been racing and accelerating and is now heading at great speed towards

173
00:10:09.381 --> 00:10:11.030
Siberia. Interestingly,

174
00:10:11.031 --> 00:10:14.510
while the magnetic South pole stays more or less where it is.

175
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.680
So that's another illustration that there's some local effect in the fluid flow

176
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.840
underneath the North pole. Um,

177
00:10:23.841 --> 00:10:28.520
something akin to the jet stream that we see in the atmosphere. That's actually,

178
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:33.140
um, driving the, the change in the magnetic North pole and they can move around.

179
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.110
So for the past 400 years,

180
00:10:36.111 --> 00:10:39.830
we think it was contained more or less within Northern Canada. Um,

181
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:43.610
but in the past 50 years, it started to move around.

182
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.870
So it was moving around about tens of kilometers a year back and forth.

183
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:49.880
And in the last 50 years,

184
00:10:49.881 --> 00:10:54.050
it started moving northwards and the past 30 years it's accelerated.

185
00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:58.850
And this year it's now moving at 50 kilometers over the course of the year,

186
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.470
heading towards Siberia.

187
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.310
<v 3>Stake in the ground or anything like they do at the South pole is that,</v>

188
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.360
is this position marked in any way? And do they have to move the marker?

189
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.510
<v 0>Yeah, it's marked on maps, but it's not going to be a physical marker,</v>

190
00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.610
partly because of how fast it's moving. And partly because, um, the nature of,

191
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.240
of where it is, there's no,

192
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:22.100
there's no solid ground up there or solid ice that's reliable. Um,

193
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:26.810
particularly since the Arctic ice is now melting at an accelerating rate. Um,

194
00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:31.640
so no nobody's up there moving markers around, but because of this motion,

195
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:32.930
normally the,

196
00:11:32.931 --> 00:11:37.430
the magnetic maps are updated every five years and they've actually had to do an

197
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:42.140
inter cycle sort of emergency update to that because it's moving so fast.

198
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.160
It's not going to affect anybody here using their compass to walk in the,

199
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.140
you know, the Highlands of Scotland,

200
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.130
but it is going to make a difference for anybody relying on the fine details,

201
00:11:52.131 --> 00:11:55.240
particularly up here in the North, uh, Northern latitudes.

202
00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.130
<v 3>I don't know anyone who is more proudly Canadian than you.</v>

203
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.540
How do you feel about Canada potentially losing the magnetic North pole?

204
00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:07.380
<v 0>Well, I only actually learned that fact today and I do feel a bit sad because I,</v>

205
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:11.370
I, it was a source of national pride, um, that, that for hundreds of years,

206
00:12:11.371 --> 00:12:15.150
we had the magnetic North pole within our territory. Um, but no,

207
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.670
there's nothing I can do about it. I can't hang on to it.

208
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.800
So this is the neat thing.

209
00:12:19.801 --> 00:12:24.060
The magnetic North pole might be moving around and taking a bit of an excursion

210
00:12:24.061 --> 00:12:25.470
around Northern latitudes.

211
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:30.270
But we also know that quite regularly on geological timescales,

212
00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.610
the whole system flips.

213
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.480
So just like I was talking about my compass reversing its polarity,

214
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.090
the whole magnetic field of the earth,

215
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:43.860
occasionally slips so that the North pole becomes the South and the South pole

216
00:12:43.861 --> 00:12:44.790
becomes the North.

217
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.870
We don't know why this is again in the details because it's an immensely

218
00:12:48.871 --> 00:12:50.670
complicated scenario,

219
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:55.410
but we do know that it happens and it happens with great regularity if not

220
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.430
periodicity.

221
00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.660
So we know that there have been 183 reversals in the past

222
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:02.430
83 million years.

223
00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.000
And that's a record that we can establish really well,

224
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:09.960
thanks to geological measurements of the magnetic field,

225
00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.970
because we have this really interesting phenomenon that when molten mental

226
00:13:14.971 --> 00:13:19.590
material comes out and solidifies that cooling volcanic rock

227
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.000
retains,

228
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:25.380
sort of the fingerprints of the Earth's magnetic field direction at that time.

229
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:28.260
So we go back to our magnetic anomaly map.

230
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.540
You'd actually see here in the mid Atlantic or the mid Pacific that where

231
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.620
material is coming up from the crust and where these tectonic plates are being

232
00:13:37.621 --> 00:13:38.580
pushed apart.

233
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:43.260
You've got this regular incursion of liquid mantle coming up and

234
00:13:43.261 --> 00:13:48.030
solidifying it's retaining the direction of the magnetic field of the earth as

235
00:13:48.031 --> 00:13:50.460
it swaps back and forth. So on that map,

236
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.740
we've got these stripes of red and blue,

237
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:55.920
which indicate that the field's been switching back and forth.

238
00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.980
What does a flip look like? Again? We don't really know,

239
00:13:58.981 --> 00:14:03.840
so we can do models. Um, and we can do some quite interesting models.

240
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:08.010
Here's computer models of what a flip might look like done in a supercomputer.

241
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.520
So here's what we think the magnetic field of the earth might look like now.

242
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:16.050
And so you've got these nice well-defined dipole magnetic field lines coming

243
00:14:16.051 --> 00:14:20.130
out, but a big mess locally towards the surface of the earth.

244
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:24.900
Some point through a reversal, you might get a situation like this,

245
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:26.490
where it's just a big mess.

246
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:30.390
You might have the North and South pole just wandering around.

247
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.410
They might disappear.

248
00:14:31.411 --> 00:14:35.790
You might have more than one pole pop-up chaotically in different places.

249
00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:39.990
The magnetic field of the whole earth might decrease altogether.

250
00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.520
We don't really know best estimates are that it might take a thousand

251
00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:48.030
or tens of thousands of years to happen. Um,

252
00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:51.060
some people think it might happen within a human lifetime, does that?

253
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.280
We could see what happened.

254
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.760
<v 4>Well, it's.</v>

255
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.950
<v 0>An interesting thing to think about that.</v>

256
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.670
We've seen the magnetic North pole go for a wander.

257
00:14:58.671 --> 00:15:02.900
That wandering seems to be accelerating since we've been making measurements

258
00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:04.190
since about 1840,

259
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.490
there's been a steady decrease in the strength of the magnetic field.

260
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.510
So it's leading some people to think that we might be in the early stages of a

261
00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:16.370
reversal, but whether that happens next year or in the next 10,000 years,

262
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.960
we can't be sure sometimes the magnetic field just goes on a bit of a wobble

263
00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:24.800
called an excursion, but then it comes back to the, the, the normal polarity.

264
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.080
But when it does flip from one end to the other,

265
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:31.520
we Mark those geological timescales in periods called crumbs.

266
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:36.520
<v 4>Is there any reason to think that a reversal of this process is dangerous?</v>

267
00:15:36.521 --> 00:15:36.701
I mean,

268
00:15:36.701 --> 00:15:40.480
it's happened so many times that it feels like it must not be catastrophic.

269
00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:41.801
<v 0>Yeah. I mean,</v>

270
00:15:41.801 --> 00:15:46.120
it does seem to be quite an alarming thing to happen on the scale of the planet.

271
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.520
Um, but we don't see strong evidence that you sort of, you know,

272
00:15:51.521 --> 00:15:55.840
evidence for mass extinctions in the fossil records are tied closely to these

273
00:15:55.841 --> 00:15:58.330
geological records. Then again,

274
00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:03.250
we also know that some animals use magnetic fields to navigate

275
00:16:03.251 --> 00:16:07.300
by. You have to be concerned about any small perturbation to something as

276
00:16:07.301 --> 00:16:09.730
complicated as our global ecosystem.

277
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:14.440
We also know that this has happened since the time that humans have been on the

278
00:16:14.441 --> 00:16:19.120
earth. Um, and we don't have any record of catastrophic things happening.

279
00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:24.520
Um, so it could be that it's just such a slow and gentle process that,

280
00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:29.740
um, ecosystems and evolution and everything can sort of keep up with the change.

281
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.730
What we might be concerned about is increased particle radiation.

282
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:37.060
We know that the magnetic field of the earth protects us from highly charged

283
00:16:37.061 --> 00:16:37.780
particles.

284
00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:41.710
It might be that more cosmic rays are able to reach the ground with a weak

285
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:42.610
magnetic field,

286
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.840
but the atmosphere itself does a pretty good job of protecting us as well.

287
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:51.550
So it might be that we just get interesting effects like Aurora seen over

288
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.040
the Galapagos islands or something like that.

289
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.800
It might not be as catastrophic as you might fear.

290
00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:01.240
So of course the next question is what are the magnetic fields like on other

291
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.670
planets? So all of the gas giants,

292
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.740
strong magnetic fields do putter unsurprisingly has the biggest of them all.

293
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:12.610
And you can actually hear the sound of Jupiter's magnetic field.

294
00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.400
If you look at the recordings from the Juno spacecraft,

295
00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.050
which reached Jupiter a few years ago.

296
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:23.380
<v 4>Uh.</v>

297
00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:28.150
<v 0>I recorded bow shock as the instrument pass through Jupiter's magnetic field.</v>

298
00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:31.990
So no surprises there, mercury has a weak one,

299
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.750
Venus and Mars don't seem to have any at all.

300
00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:39.070
And the relative strengths is tied to what's happening in the core.

301
00:17:39.071 --> 00:17:42.550
Mars has a solid core. We think no conduction, no rotation.

302
00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:46.210
So that's not going to generate a magnetic field that might go some way to

303
00:17:46.211 --> 00:17:48.940
explaining why Mars has lost the atmosphere.

304
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.530
It used to have magnetic field might have some sort of, uh,

305
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.760
confining action there. But the really interesting one is Uranus.

306
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.240
Uranus is an interesting planet in its own, right?

307
00:18:00.241 --> 00:18:04.620
Because of course its axis of rotation is tilted at 98 degrees to the plane of

308
00:18:04.621 --> 00:18:05.370
the ecliptic,

309
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:10.140
which since we've been talking about everything being connected to rotation,

310
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:14.340
what does Uranus's magnetic field look like? And it's a complete mess.

311
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:19.440
The access of the magnetic field in Uranus is actually tilted at 60

312
00:18:19.441 --> 00:18:21.570
degrees from the axis of rotation.

313
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:26.580
And what that means is the whole field is tumbling as the planet rotates,

314
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:30.840
which means that the magnetic field lines detach and then reattach in really

315
00:18:30.841 --> 00:18:33.150
chaotic ways, which means that the,

316
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:37.440
the planet actually sort of has a strobe effect with its magnetic field that it

317
00:18:37.441 --> 00:18:40.680
opens up and lets charge particles in and then snaps closed again,

318
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.570
opens and closes open closes.

319
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:44.430
<v 3>Presumably the sun has a magnetic field.</v>

320
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.880
<v 0>It does, it's generated in a slightly different way. Um,</v>

321
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.430
but of course it has a very large magnetic field.

322
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:54.990
We know that it waxes and wanes on a quite regular timescale of 11 years and

323
00:18:54.991 --> 00:18:59.670
that's tied into solar activity and sunspot cycles and we can see the beautiful

324
00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:01.800
magnetic loops that are created from that.

325
00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.720
<v 3>There's still a lot. We don't exactly know like there is like,</v>

326
00:19:05.721 --> 00:19:09.200
it is still one of those sort of mystery subjects. There's lots. We do know,

327
00:19:09.201 --> 00:19:10.700
but there seems like there's lots. We don't know.

328
00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.710
<v 0>Yeah, I think that's correct.</v>

329
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:16.940
And when you think about what's going into all of this, the very,

330
00:19:16.941 --> 00:19:20.300
very complex interplay between all of the different systems,

331
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:25.070
the difficulty in understanding what's going on below the surface of the earth,

332
00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.750
3000 kilometers below the surface of the earth and making guesswork there,

333
00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:33.320
plus the fact that we've only been making these measurements for a few hundred

334
00:19:33.321 --> 00:19:38.240
years. Um, yeah, I think it's a very, uh, complicated field,

335
00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.520
but when I'm sure that it's going to make lots of progress in,

336
00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:41.653
in the near future.

337
00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:42.980
<v 5>Different from the,</v>

338
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:46.640
it's not just a scaled up version of that electromagnet is what's called

339
00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:51.170
superconducting magnet. So actually when I applied a,

340
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.500
a current to that elect to that little mini electromagnet with the orange wire

341
00:19:54.501 --> 00:19:55.100
earlier on.
