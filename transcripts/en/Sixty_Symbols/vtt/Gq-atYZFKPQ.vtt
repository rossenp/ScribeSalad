1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.940
<v 0>It's that time of the year again, it's the Nobel prizes.</v>

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.470
<v 1>Always turns my phone up. You'd never know, but again,</v>

3
00:00:07.471 --> 00:00:10.980
overlooked. Yeah. Just needs to check the number.

4
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:12.800
<v 0>I called it. Yes.</v>

5
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.070
I'm feeling a bit smug about this because about five minutes before the

6
00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:20.210
announcement, I suddenly had this feeling who was going to win and sure enough,

7
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.250
they did too. At least they won half the prize anyway.

8
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.100
And the other half of the prize went to a guy called Jim people.

9
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.150
<v 1>And a good call. Let's us. See Jim peoples get past the Nobel prize.</v>

10
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.420
He's regarded, I think as the father of modern cosmology.

11
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.850
<v 2>Did you put a bet on or anything I should have done? Shouldn't I really, yeah.</v>

12
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.920
<v 0>But no, I didn't. And it was literally five minutes before the announcement.</v>

13
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.200
It wasn't that clever prediction because I was certainly,

14
00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:43.850
wasn't the only person predicting it. And it's been,

15
00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:46.640
they've been sort of one of the runners and riders for a number of years now,

16
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.590
but I sort of thought it was their time. It's a slightly strange, uh, award.

17
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.161
And actually,

18
00:00:52.161 --> 00:00:56.390
so the citation reads was awarded for contributions to our understanding of the

19
00:00:56.391 --> 00:00:59.060
evolution of the universe and Earth's place in the cosmos,

20
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.090
which could be pretty much for anything really,

21
00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:04.820
because that covers pretty much everything there is. Um,

22
00:01:04.821 --> 00:01:07.160
but Jim Peebles is a cosmologist, um,

23
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.720
and is really one of the tiring founding figures of modern cosmology.

24
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.220
Um, in that he did a lot of the work. He was part of the group that was, um,

25
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.040
predicting the existence of the cosmic microwave background.

26
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.090
He did a lot of work about the growth of structure in the universe. Uh,

27
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.590
the impact of dark matter on how structure would grow. So really, I mean, he is,

28
00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:28.010
if you,

29
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.370
if you teach a course on cosmology in large part of you're talking about his

30
00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:31.930
work.

31
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.400
<v 1>Model, which is fitting the data so well,</v>

32
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.870
has his influence on every single part of it.

33
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.131
<v 0>He is a theorist,</v>

34
00:01:40.131 --> 00:01:43.190
but he's one of those theorists who actually maintains a very close link to the

35
00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:46.310
observation. So some of his work has actually he's written papers,

36
00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:48.230
which are presenting observational data,

37
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.170
but more in a fairly theoretical framework.

38
00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:52.850
So you would think of him as a theoretical.

39
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.500
<v 1>He's just demonstrated that in modern cosmology,</v>

40
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.350
these are the key ingredients we look like we need. And he,

41
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.850
he was there at the start of each one of them playing a role.

42
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:08.510
So he can be properly regarded as the father of the subject.

43
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:13.280
And the expert says that they're on your board of modern

44
00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:17.390
cosmology. That's what I decided to come into the tutorial today.

45
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.340
We have tutorial system here at Nottingham where all the first years get to have

46
00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:26.000
a, there's usually six in the group. I screwed up.

47
00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:28.790
I had to do 12 cars. And so I thought, well,

48
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.570
you've got to tell them about the Nobel prize. At least the bit I know about it.

49
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.450
<v 0>If you were talking about Jim Peebles, you wouldn't say, Oh,</v>

50
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.570
he did so-and-so because there's just so much he's contributed.

51
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.770
So the other half of the prize was shared between Michelle Maya and DDA Cato,

52
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.880
and they worked on studying exoplanets. They still work on studying exoplanets.

53
00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:50.540
So planets outside the solar system, um, and it was awarded for, and that,

54
00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:54.110
let me get the exact wording here for the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting,

55
00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.340
a solar type star.

56
00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.400
So it was really their discovery in 1995 was what kicked off the entire

57
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.840
field of exoplanet studies.

58
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.010
<v 3>Cause like exoplanets, these days are like candy aren't they they're like,</v>

59
00:03:05.011 --> 00:03:05.844
you know.

60
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.580
<v 0>There are many, many thousands of them at that point. There was only one,</v>

61
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.180
actually that's not quite true because there were other planets and that's,

62
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.280
it's interesting, the way they've worded the citation.

63
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.620
They said an exoplanet orbiting, a solar type star.

64
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.860
The first exoplanet was actually found, uh, orbiting, uh,

65
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.440
pots on a neutron star rotating neutron star,

66
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.890
which is a very weird system and no one really expected to find planets around

67
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.130
saws. Um, and so it was clearly something very strange. And so,

68
00:03:29.131 --> 00:03:31.350
although it was interesting, it was like everyone was well,

69
00:03:31.351 --> 00:03:32.670
it's nothing like the solar system.

70
00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:36.750
So it's not really a planet in the sense that we would understand it, the rule.

71
00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:41.010
So tentative discoveries of planets, orbiting, giant stars that preceded,

72
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.890
uh, the myo and kilo discovery.

73
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.130
But this was really the first announcement of one,

74
00:03:47.131 --> 00:03:49.950
which we would sort of equate with something like the solar system.

75
00:03:49.951 --> 00:03:51.420
So it was a solar type star,

76
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.820
very like the sun with the planet in orbit around it.

77
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.850
<v 3>Do you happen to know what star was, was, it was obviously a nearby.</v>

78
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.810
<v 0>It was, uh, it's 51. Pegasus is the star and the planet is called 51,</v>

79
00:04:00.811 --> 00:04:03.600
Pegasus B it's about 50 light years away.

80
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.060
It's very ordinary stars and say it's a G type star.

81
00:04:06.061 --> 00:04:08.730
So very light the sun a little bit more massive.

82
00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:11.760
I think at 1.1 times the mass of the sun is a tiny bit more massive,

83
00:04:11.761 --> 00:04:15.960
but really almost a twin of the sun, very bog standard kind of star.

84
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.140
<v 3>What method did they use to just discover it?</v>

85
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.500
<v 0>So they use this, uh, radio velocity method. I mean,</v>

86
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.930
there are now a whole slew of methods that are used for,

87
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.600
for discovering and studying exoplanets,

88
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.870
but one of the foundational techniques and the one that made this first

89
00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:32.520
discovery was this radial velocity technique,

90
00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:35.730
wherever if you've got a star and you think of a planet in orbit around it,

91
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.030
the sort of simple picture is the sun. The star is stationary in the middle,

92
00:04:39.031 --> 00:04:39.990
on the planets orbiting around,

93
00:04:39.991 --> 00:04:42.720
but of course they're actually tugging each other and sort of orbiting around

94
00:04:42.721 --> 00:04:44.070
their mutual center of gravity.

95
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.640
What that means is that the planet is tugging the star backwards and forwards as

96
00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:50.820
well as the, uh, the star tugging the planet backwards and forwards.

97
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.830
So the star is actually oscillating.

98
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.250
And so sometimes it's moving towards you and sometimes it's moving away from you

99
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.030
and by studying the spectra of the star and looking at those little dips,

100
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.780
whether a spectral lines in the star, you can see whether they're being shifted,

101
00:05:03.781 --> 00:05:06.270
Doppler shifted towards the red end of the spectrum or the blue end of the

102
00:05:06.271 --> 00:05:09.750
spectrum. So you measure that backwards and forwards wobble of the star.

103
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.740
And that gives you a measure of the mass of the thing that's orbiting around it,

104
00:05:13.741 --> 00:05:15.390
as well as how rapidly it's orbiting around it,

105
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.820
by how quickly the thing oscillates backwards and forwards.

106
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.220
<v 3>You know, that's a, that's a good method. I imagine.</v>

107
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.300
I imagine that method had been thought of for quite a while and all the

108
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.780
astronomers in the world have access to telescopes and telescope time.

109
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.240
What did the scientists do that made them able to be first? Like what,

110
00:05:32.241 --> 00:05:36.210
what method or trick or idea that they have that made them the winners?

111
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.060
<v 0>So there's a couple of aspects here. Firstly,</v>

112
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:43.890
people weren't really looking that hard at the time because there was no

113
00:05:43.891 --> 00:05:48.110
expectation that you'd actually be able to detect much because we had this.

114
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.880
So if you think about what's easy, what's easy to detect. In this case,

115
00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:53.670
you want something where there's a strong gravitational pull between your planet

116
00:05:53.671 --> 00:05:56.700
and the star to target a long way. So it's got to be a big planet.

117
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.690
So there's two things. You want it to be a big planet. So it's massive.

118
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:00.770
So it'll talk with think backwards, forwards,

119
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.970
and actually you want them close together.

120
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:04.970
So the polar gravity is strong so that, that the movements are bigger.

121
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.010
And so what you'd really want is a planet like Jupiter close to the star.

122
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.330
Now at the time we only knew about one solar system and Jupiter in our solar

123
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:17.750
system is a long way out as is the way with scientists. You know,

124
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:19.670
if you've only got one example of something,

125
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:22.070
you convince yourself that that's the way the universe works.

126
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.020
So we had all these ideas at the time,

127
00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:26.990
back in the 1990s and before the actually Jupiter,

128
00:06:26.991 --> 00:06:30.500
like planets only existed in the outer reaches of solar systems and things close

129
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:33.320
to their stars of rural little things like mercury and earth,

130
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:36.410
which you wouldn't be able to detect. And so because of that,

131
00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:39.650
there wasn't really a huge expectation that we'd be able to detect this kind of

132
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:42.950
effect and what these guys actually found was something that's about half the

133
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.160
massive Jupiter, very close to a star. And so actually,

134
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:49.190
and subsequently of course we found many of these hot Jupiter like planets.

135
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:51.320
So Jupiter like planets, which are close to the star.

136
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.230
And so it turns out that actually the universe doesn't work the way we thought

137
00:06:54.231 --> 00:06:55.064
it did back then.

138
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.660
And there are mechanisms where even if a big planet forms of a long way out in

139
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.553
the solar system,

140
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.850
there are many mechanisms by which you can kind of migrate inwards towards its

141
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.350
star. Um,

142
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.130
so they found something that no one was really that much expecting to find, um,

143
00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:13.310
which is why there wasn't a huge rush to try and find these things.

144
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.800
The other thing is they had some very clever instrumentation.

145
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:20.390
They actually built a custom built spectrograph that allow them to measure very

146
00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:23.450
small Doppler shifts. They were down at sort of tens of meters per second,

147
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:25.220
that they were measuring these wobbles in these stars,

148
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.960
which did require very good instrumentation, very stable instrumentation,

149
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:32.870
where you can actually calibrate things with that kind of accuracy to really

150
00:07:32.871 --> 00:07:34.280
measure those very small shifts.

151
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:38.740
<v 3>So you couldn't have just had like an off the shelf night of VLT and have found</v>

152
00:07:38.741 --> 00:07:39.520
it sort of.

153
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.390
<v 0>You probably could now with VLT, but in the 1990s, no,</v>

154
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.630
you really wanted a custom built into it. It wasn't on that larger telescope.

155
00:07:46.631 --> 00:07:50.140
It was, I think it was a two meter telescope. So even by then those standards,

156
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.590
the standards of the 1990s, it wasn't a particularly huge telescope,

157
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.490
but it was just a very clever spectrograph and they were looking for something

158
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.110
that no one else was really looking for.

159
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.750
<v 3>As an astronomer. And you're an astronomer in the nineties. I was,</v>

160
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.240
do you kick yourself and think, Oh, I could have done that.

161
00:08:07.241 --> 00:08:09.100
That would have been like a week's work and I could have,

162
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:09.993
I could have been the one.

163
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.430
<v 0>So the interesting thing is before their paper in the 1990s,</v>

164
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.340
in the 1980s, let me show you another. So let me show you their paper.

165
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.580
So here's their paper published in 1995,

166
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:28.090
a Jupiter mass companion to a solar type style Nobel prize.

167
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.690
And it's, you know, it's actually not a particularly long paper.

168
00:08:31.691 --> 00:08:34.150
It's not got many pretty pictures in it. A few graphs.

169
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:36.940
<v 3>Not even a picture of the star, even a picture.</v>

170
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.190
<v 0>No, nothing spectacular about it at all. I mean, you know,</v>

171
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.890
nice looking data that here's the, so here's the,

172
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.680
the wobble backwards and forwards of the star.

173
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:48.520
So sometimes it's going away from us sometimes it's coming towards us and you

174
00:08:48.521 --> 00:08:50.650
can see, so the here's the scale 50 meters per second.

175
00:08:50.651 --> 00:08:52.510
So this small ships that you're actually imagining here,

176
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.970
so that's the wobble that they were measuring. So here's the interesting,

177
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.650
that was the 1990s in 1989. This paper came out

178
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.680
the unseen companion of telephone number, a probable Brown dog.

179
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:10.050
And it turns out they had actually also discovered a Jupiter like planet he's on

180
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:12.480
there as well. He's actually, my always is on there as well.

181
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.990
So he's one of the authors, but the, the primary mover,

182
00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:18.690
this guy called Dave Latham was actually in an office just over the corridor

183
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.690
from me at the time. Cause I was a PhD student and he was a proper,

184
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.900
serious scientist at that point, uh, at the CFA in Boston,

185
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.570
he wasn't very excited about this result. I mean, he was a bit excited,

186
00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:29.280
but he was actually, you know, because, and again,

187
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:31.860
it comes back to the fact that no one was expecting to find planets.

188
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.100
And the reason why he didn't know that he'd found a planet.

189
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.730
So Brown doors is sort of one up from planets, they're sort of failed stars.

190
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:42.000
And no one was, you know, people were expecting to find Brown doors.

191
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:46.020
Cause we find binary stars quite a lot of the time and they have different mass

192
00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:49.380
ratios and it wouldn't be terribly surprising if once in a while the little one

193
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:51.510
turned out to be not quite making it as a star.

194
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.320
So people were not that surprised to be finding stars with Brown dwarfs in orbit

195
00:09:55.321 --> 00:09:58.830
around them because they're basically just very closely related to binary stars

196
00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:02.850
that we know exists, binary it's one half of it's kind of failed to ignite.

197
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:03.780
So one half is a star.

198
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:06.990
The other half didn't quite make it because they weren't expecting to find

199
00:10:06.991 --> 00:10:09.150
planets. He convinced himself he hadn't found a planet.

200
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.850
And the reason why there's an ambiguity, because you might think, well,

201
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:13.560
you know, we know what masses Brown dwarves are.

202
00:10:13.561 --> 00:10:15.240
We know what massive planets I wouldn't have known.

203
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.730
It turns out there's an ambiguity in this method.

204
00:10:17.731 --> 00:10:20.730
And the ambiguity in this method is I kind of drew this when I was waving my

205
00:10:20.731 --> 00:10:22.440
hands around. I did it like that,

206
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.140
but we don't know whether the system's like that or whether it's sort of,

207
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.740
I can't do it that way, that way like that. And of course,

208
00:10:28.741 --> 00:10:30.210
if the planets orbiting that way,

209
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.690
you don't see that the star is still moving it's,

210
00:10:33.691 --> 00:10:35.160
but it's being tugged in the plane of the sky.

211
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:38.040
So you don't see these Doppler shifts. So this is ambiguous.

212
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.480
And of course you can have anything in between.

213
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.620
So actually if you see a certain movement, it could be like, uh, if it's,

214
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.440
you know, you see a certain movement, it could be a relatively low mass thing.

215
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.440
That's in the plane of the sky. So we see all the movement or the style,

216
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.320
or it could be, it's almost in a much more massive thing.

217
00:10:52.321 --> 00:10:55.110
And actually this thing's jerking around all over the place,

218
00:10:55.111 --> 00:10:56.490
but we don't see most of the motion.

219
00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:58.760
Cause most of it's in the plane of the sky rather than towards the.

220
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:00.570
<v 3>You've got to get lucky. It's kind of,</v>

221
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:04.280
you need it to be punching you in the face rather than wobbling around to get

222
00:11:04.281 --> 00:11:05.060
the biggest signal.

223
00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.400
<v 0>You really want to be lucky and just catch, catch the thing edge on.</v>

224
00:11:07.401 --> 00:11:11.910
So you see the biggest signal because there's less ambiguity. You,

225
00:11:11.911 --> 00:11:15.170
you can't tell really directly from the observation,

226
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.410
whether you're seeing a Brown dwarf kind of in the plane of the sky,

227
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:21.140
close to the plane of the sky or a planet close to edge on.

228
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.950
And because they had this expectation that they shouldn't be finding these

229
00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:25.311
planets,

230
00:11:25.311 --> 00:11:28.730
they convinced themselves that they were seeing a Brown door star binary fairly

231
00:11:28.731 --> 00:11:29.510
close on.

232
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.630
And it was a bit unlikely because actually it has to be surprisingly close to

233
00:11:32.631 --> 00:11:35.150
face on for it to work, but they sort of convinced themselves.

234
00:11:35.151 --> 00:11:37.970
They do actually say somewhere in the paper or it could be a large planet.

235
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:41.660
So they do actually at least make, you know, say we might've found a planet.

236
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:47.180
The extra thing that Maya and Kayla did is they also looked at the

237
00:11:47.181 --> 00:11:48.290
properties of the star.

238
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.920
So they actually could measure how fast the star is rotating because can see one

239
00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:57.100
half of it. If it stars rotating, one half of it's coming towards you,

240
00:11:57.101 --> 00:12:00.850
the other half going away from you. And so you can actually see the,

241
00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:03.190
what you ended up seeing is a kind of a broadening of the lines.

242
00:12:03.191 --> 00:12:04.720
So instead of seeing the line wobbling,

243
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.840
you see part of the line being shifted one way, part of it, the other way,

244
00:12:07.841 --> 00:12:09.940
the net effect of that as you see a slightly broader line,

245
00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:14.710
so you could measure the rotation at the star, kind of the, the, the at least.

246
00:12:14.711 --> 00:12:15.910
But again, this is the same thing. Like,

247
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.090
is it a star that's rotating in the plane of the sky or is it rotating edge on,

248
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.390
but they knew some of the properties of the star.

249
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.510
You could just make observations of it, finding out what kind of star it is.

250
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:30.130
And we know how fast stars typically actually rotate that are of that type.

251
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.000
So they have this measurement of this kind of one component of how fast the

252
00:12:35.001 --> 00:12:35.890
things are rotating.

253
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.850
And that could be either a very fast rotating star that's sort of pole on,

254
00:12:39.851 --> 00:12:42.490
or it could be a relatively slowly rotating star. That's Adrian,

255
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.660
but we know intrinsically how fast I was like this actually rotate from that.

256
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:50.320
You can figure out that actually this system is relatively close to age on.

257
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:51.910
So there's one more leap here,

258
00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:55.900
which is that as long as the stars axis of rotation is the same as the planet's

259
00:12:55.901 --> 00:12:59.410
axis of rotation, which for example, it is pretty much in the solar system.

260
00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:02.290
The sun is rotating about kind of the same access that the solar system is.

261
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:05.800
Then that actually tells you that the system has to be relatively close to

262
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.160
Adrian. And once you've got that, then you know, you've found a planet.

263
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.640
So that was the sort of the extra bit that I guess is what really got them,

264
00:13:12.641 --> 00:13:13.474
the Nobel prize.

265
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.290
Plus actually just the confidence to say we found something that no one expected

266
00:13:17.291 --> 00:13:18.000
to find.

267
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.720
<v 4>So in the future of one day, we go and visit other systems and other planets,</v>

268
00:13:21.721 --> 00:13:24.780
and we can somehow do this. This will be this plant,

269
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:26.310
this particular Nobel prize on a,

270
00:13:26.311 --> 00:13:28.530
be a good one to visit wouldn't it it'd be like a historic one.

271
00:13:28.531 --> 00:13:31.140
It'd be like visiting, like for humanity. This was a,

272
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:33.120
this was a historic site for us.

273
00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.690
<v 0>I mean, it's not the easiest one to get to because it is 50 light years away.</v>

274
00:13:36.691 --> 00:13:39.300
And we know, no, we now know about planets. You know,

275
00:13:39.301 --> 00:13:41.760
there are only a few light years away. Um,

276
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.550
so it's probably not the first one that would ever get visited, but yeah,

277
00:13:44.551 --> 00:13:47.580
when it becomes routine, it will become one of the stops on the tourist trail.

278
00:13:47.581 --> 00:13:50.100
I suspect there's of course there could be other planets in the system, right.

279
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:53.700
We've just seen this one, um, fairly massive Jupiter, like planet,

280
00:13:53.701 --> 00:13:54.840
very close to the star,

281
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.710
which really wouldn't be very hospitable because it's going to be a gas giant

282
00:13:57.711 --> 00:14:00.780
and it's gonna be very hot and very unpleasant. Um, but who knows,

283
00:14:00.781 --> 00:14:02.790
there could be other planets further out in the solar system.

284
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.470
<v 4>Father of modern cosmology. Does that mean there's an older cosmology?</v>

285
00:14:10.471 --> 00:14:11.520
Like where does it, where did,

286
00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.100
where did old cosmology transition to modern cosmic.

287
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:19.200
<v 1>Um, giving the transition time around the 1960s, which by the way,</v>

288
00:14:19.201 --> 00:14:21.540
is another important for the,

289
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:26.400
that sort of the E pocket Higgs and kibble and browse and uncle Aaron

290
00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:29.760
people, the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation.

291
00:14:29.761 --> 00:14:34.290
I think that kind of transformed the field from being one that was

292
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.940
full of speculation and promise in solving Einstein's

293
00:14:38.941 --> 00:14:42.630
equations without really knowing what the background material was in the

294
00:14:42.631 --> 00:14:44.700
universe. To first,

295
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:47.790
the first time we established that this radiation,

296
00:14:47.791 --> 00:14:50.040
this remnant of the hot,

297
00:14:50.041 --> 00:14:54.380
big bang that emerged when the first atoms were formed,

298
00:14:54.381 --> 00:14:58.940
say 400,000 years after the big bang and then just propagated

299
00:14:58.941 --> 00:15:01.460
outwards for the next 3.8 billion years,

300
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:06.560
that the detection of that in the 1960s, 1965, in fact,

301
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:09.080
it was announced by Penzias and Wilson,

302
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:14.170
that where the associated attention pitcher to this radiation

303
00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.140
that's right, I think is what you might call I'm calling here.

304
00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:21.640
That's kind of the start of modern cosmology and peoples was that in fact,

305
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.080
it's not very well known, but, um,

306
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:30.790
the paper by Penzias and Wilson, which is one page long.

307
00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:33.610
Now we are busting,

308
00:15:33.611 --> 00:15:38.500
I got writing all these long page one page paper about the third or fourth

309
00:15:38.501 --> 00:15:42.520
line, having a name announced that they discovered this radiation,

310
00:15:42.521 --> 00:15:47.170
that they don't really know why it is. They say that in the preceding paper,

311
00:15:47.171 --> 00:15:48.004
in the journal,

312
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:52.690
which is Jim Peebles paper with decay and roll and

313
00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:57.400
Wilkinson, they say, they've come up with an explanation for what this could be.

314
00:15:57.401 --> 00:16:00.310
And it is in fact, you know, the microwave background,

315
00:16:00.311 --> 00:16:03.730
radiation at a temperature of around at the time,

316
00:16:03.731 --> 00:16:06.850
they say 3.5 Kelvin, um,

317
00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.230
sort of it's now about seen as about 2.7 Calvin, but that's that's okay.

318
00:16:11.231 --> 00:16:14.800
It was 3.5 plus or minus 9.1. So they were perfectly okay,

319
00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:19.420
but people was there. And in fact, not only was he there, he, he,

320
00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:22.480
he's the one that actually in the previous paper,

321
00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.280
the one that literally appears before, which is a mindblowing four pages long.

322
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:29.980
So that's a huge paper by comparison.

323
00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:34.900
He's the one along with his coauthors who suggest that actually this

324
00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:39.070
remnant radiation is linked to the hot, big bang, and he,

325
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.920
and that it's got these thermal properties. It's that I think,

326
00:16:41.921 --> 00:16:43.250
which is really key that,

327
00:16:43.251 --> 00:16:48.190
that you can pin down has been one of people's men contributions here that he,

328
00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.960
he recognizes the significance of that of the radiation has been linked to the

329
00:16:52.961 --> 00:16:56.290
early universe. And the second thing that he does,

330
00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.910
which I hadn't seen done before,

331
00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:02.080
he points out that because we now know the temperature of that radiation.

332
00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.620
And because we believe in the idea of general relativity,

333
00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:10.120
and we can understand how that radiation changes its temperature as the

334
00:17:10.121 --> 00:17:13.120
universe changes scale, because it gets redshifted shifted,

335
00:17:13.121 --> 00:17:17.440
it cools down as the universe expands. It means it's hotter earlier on.

336
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:22.660
And so he's able to link the temperature you've got today to an estimate of what

337
00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:26.740
the amount of matter must be in the universe today,

338
00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.490
because he knows what it must be sort of in the,

339
00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:34.300
around the time of nuclear synthesis. He's got a boundary can use.

340
00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:39.280
And by doing that, he actually end this paper without,

341
00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.580
I don't think necessarily really realizing that the same,

342
00:17:42.581 --> 00:17:44.110
there must be some sort of dark matter.

343
00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:49.060
He's actually points out that the estimate for the amount of baryons matter

344
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.610
in the universe in terms of barriers is actually lower than the critical

345
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.120
matter amount that you need that we see today.

346
00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.910
We believe the universe today is specially flat.

347
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.760
That means there's a critical amount of matter in there.

348
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:07.770
And he said in his calculations, there's not, there's not enough. And in fact,

349
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.090
at the end of his first paper,

350
00:18:09.091 --> 00:18:12.120
the one that appears with Penzias and Wilson comes up with ways of trying to

351
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.510
increase the amounts, but he was there.

352
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:19.710
He was pointing out this connection between measurement of the

353
00:18:19.711 --> 00:18:22.890
radiation and the density of matching universe.

354
00:18:22.891 --> 00:18:27.540
And that's absolutely integral to the rest of cosmology. The man in the street,

355
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.480
probably hasn't heard of the land to CDM model,

356
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.840
but I think if you said the standard model of cosmology,

357
00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:39.120
that's what you would say peoples was responsible for the standard model of

358
00:18:39.121 --> 00:18:43.590
cosmology has various contributions to the overall energy budget.

359
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:48.120
So before peoples was around, we knew that there were baryons right. And, and,

360
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:52.650
but we didn't necessarily know how many and people began to put a bound on that

361
00:18:52.651 --> 00:18:53.880
from this paper,

362
00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:58.890
but then he made some even bigger contributions in some sense.

363
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.490
The next thing he sorts of realized was that again,

364
00:19:02.491 --> 00:19:05.820
using the fact that you've got this cosmic microwave background that had been

365
00:19:05.821 --> 00:19:07.800
detected by Penzias and Wilson,

366
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.870
he was aware of the fact that this fluctuations to be expected in this cosmic

367
00:19:12.871 --> 00:19:17.190
microwave background. And he's the one along with you who,

368
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:21.570
who actually was the first to fully do sort of numerical

369
00:19:21.571 --> 00:19:26.220
simulations of different types of cosmology and

370
00:19:26.221 --> 00:19:27.540
predict what the,

371
00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:31.710
the Doppler they acoustic oscillations were that we see in the microwave

372
00:19:31.711 --> 00:19:35.070
background. Remember those peak structures that are big peaks,

373
00:19:35.071 --> 00:19:37.740
and then we'd go down. As you, as in the CMB,

374
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:42.330
he was the first to numerically show, what different cosmologies would predict.

375
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:47.700
And so he, in amongst that he showed what a flat universe would do.

376
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:52.050
And that's the one that pretty much is observed by first of all,

377
00:19:52.051 --> 00:19:54.960
by w map. And then by plank,

378
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.990
the initial anisotropy is with demonstrated by Kobe,

379
00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:03.420
but the original work solving the numerical codes

380
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:08.450
to show roughly what they would look like is from people's. What made him good?

381
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:10.520
Like, why is he, why is he good at this?

382
00:20:10.521 --> 00:20:14.810
What is it about him that all the other cosmologists haven't got?

383
00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.530
I don't think anybody has his overview.

384
00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:23.450
He's a, his very, very strong mathematically. He he's,

385
00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.150
he's developed the statistics that are,

386
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:31.310
you that's used in much of the analysis of the CMB and of large-scale structure.

387
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:34.370
When you're looking at correlations of different regions of the sky,

388
00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.850
he developed the techniques you need more than that.

389
00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:42.500
And these ability to solve equations and do integrals and things. He had this,

390
00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.480
he has, he's still there. He's 85,

391
00:20:44.481 --> 00:20:49.360
but he's still very active and really on the ball. He has this overview,

392
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:53.650
this, he can see the bigger picture. He can see how we're given calculation.

393
00:20:53.651 --> 00:20:58.060
A given observation tells you something about something else in the

394
00:20:58.061 --> 00:21:02.530
universe by extracting out from that small initial

395
00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:03.520
observation,

396
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:08.860
that sort of it's impact on the whole of the background evolution. And,

397
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.900
and to do that is not easy too,

398
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:14.680
because there's so many balls in the air and he's able to juggle them all in

399
00:21:14.681 --> 00:21:19.270
the, and I think that in many ways, this has big scale. Have you ever met him?

400
00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:21.820
Oh yeah. I've met him many times at conferences.

401
00:21:21.821 --> 00:21:24.700
He's such a nice guy is one of these people that,

402
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.630
that is always prepared to give you his time.

403
00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:32.350
If you're walking for dinner or having lunch, or he's, he,

404
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:36.730
he asks really pertinent questions. And, um,

405
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.680
but he's have always found him to be somebody that has easy to get

406
00:21:41.681 --> 00:21:44.560
on with that. When he asks questions is very polite. And,

407
00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.410
but he's not afraid to tell you if you, if he thinks you're wrong,

408
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.330
which he's done to me a couple of times.

409
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.390
<v 3>Professor, I know in cosmology,</v>

410
00:21:51.391 --> 00:21:53.820
there are kind of different camps and schools of thought, you know,

411
00:21:53.821 --> 00:21:57.770
people who like string theory and a, B and C, and all that is is,

412
00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:00.990
is people's in yours on your side or on the opposite side.

413
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:05.010
<v 1>People sit sort of above it all. He,</v>

414
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:07.440
I don't think he's worried about the camps to be honest.

415
00:22:07.441 --> 00:22:09.510
He's he goes where the science tells him.

416
00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:15.750
<v 4>Really excited Neil, because it's for lithium batteries.</v>

417
00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:18.660
And so he's gone on a battery Safari.

418
00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:22.320
Some of you know that Neil is a motorcyclist.

419
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:24.990
He has an electric motorcycle.
