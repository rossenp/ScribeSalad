1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.620
<v 0>So ready. One of my favorite subjects after football obviously is, um,</v>

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.220
as you know,

3
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.910
is black holes and there's over the last sort of six months or so there's been

4
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:11.730
some quite big black hole news. And I think it's time that, um,

5
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.990
that we shared it with you go, I'm all ears what's going on. So, so as you know,

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.210
I mean, this there's been a problem. That's kind of been around my,

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.220
my entire life basically. And it's the famous black hole information paradox,

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.300
uh, which so Hawking first or proposed it around the time I was born about,

9
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.140
about to, well, should I say how long ago, mid seventies it was. Um,

10
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.910
and so Hawking spent his whole life trying to solve this problem.

11
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.100
Never quite managed it. Well, it seems that in the last year or so, uh, we,

12
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.360
I think we're there. I think it's been sold. What is the problem in very,

13
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:49.050
in a nutshell, it's that black holes seem to lose information.

14
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.640
They seem to have sort of information seems to disappear inside black holes. Um,

15
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.480
and that kind of breaks fundamentally the laws of quantum mechanics,

16
00:00:57.481 --> 00:01:01.290
quantum mechanics basically tells you that, um, you can't lose information.

17
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:02.850
What goes in must come out.

18
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.840
So Hawking proposed that you seem to see evidence that black holes were actually

19
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:09.300
losing this information. And he figured, well,

20
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.120
that means that breaking quantum mechanics, this is like sacrilege.

21
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.560
<v 1>And he went to physics assess information. What do they mean?</v>

22
00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:20.510
You don't mean like three bottles of milk or the Liverpool game will

23
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.420
score was three to like, what is information?

24
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.870
<v 0>I can absolutely mean that. So let, let me give you an example.</v>

25
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.120
I've actually come prepared with an, with an example.

26
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.860
So obviously what I was going to talk about information,

27
00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:33.830
what we really want to talk about is, is in the context of entropy.

28
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.110
So I'm Jordan lockdown. I've been homeschooling my kids and, uh,

29
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.090
we've been doing some experiments. I'm not very much,

30
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.330
I'm not very good experimentalists. I'm no film Moriarty. Right? And,

31
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.300
but we've been trying a few. One of the ones we did was we, um,

32
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.240
balancing liquids of different density on top of one another.

33
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.260
Can you see that radio?

34
00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:54.470
I've got a liquid that I've got the blue liquid on top of the,

35
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.620
the red liquid and then the other one, it's the other way round.

36
00:01:57.621 --> 00:02:01.550
You can't quite see it as well, but the red liquid is on top. Okay.

37
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.090
So we've got two different liquids. These look very different, right?

38
00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:05.780
These two liquids,

39
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.170
they look very different and you would say they're completely different States.

40
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.390
But what I can do is of course I can stay the liquid. Right.

41
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.910
And I can stay the other one. All right. And now if I show you them,

42
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.730
you can't tell the difference between those guys, right?

43
00:02:22.731 --> 00:02:23.870
They look exactly the same.

44
00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:26.660
You can't tell whether this one was the one that had the blue on top or this one

45
00:02:26.661 --> 00:02:30.860
was the one that had the blue on top. It's impossible to tell, right?

46
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.000
Just by looking at it.

47
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:34.370
So the measurements that you're doing just by staring at this thing,

48
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.090
it could be either state that created it could have been the one with the red on

49
00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:39.620
top of it. It could have been the one in the blue on top.

50
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.740
There could be lots of other ways you could have created that same sort of gunky

51
00:02:42.741 --> 00:02:44.990
mess, right. And that gives the entropy.

52
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.950
This is like an uncertainty I sort of missing information and stuff you don't

53
00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:52.580
know, just by, based on the measurements that you're doing of this object.

54
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.391
Similarly, you know,

55
00:02:53.391 --> 00:02:55.820
you have that sort of set of headphones that are all tangled.

56
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.950
There could have been loads of different ways they could have gotten to that

57
00:02:57.951 --> 00:03:02.470
roughly tangled state that gives this entropy in some sense of missing

58
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:05.890
information. Now, of course, in the case of this, this liquid,

59
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:09.430
I could sort of dive inside and unpick the microscopic structure of the whole

60
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:13.660
thing and extract the information out of whether it was blue on top of the star

61
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.360
or red on top. I could in principle get that out of it.

62
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.790
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

63
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.460
So you're talking about almost like doing the ultimate crime scene investigation

64
00:03:20.461 --> 00:03:22.680
and unpicking. This came from that direction.

65
00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:26.010
And this came from that direction and figuring out all this stuff to say, Oh,

66
00:03:26.011 --> 00:03:27.450
it was red and blue at the start.

67
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.810
<v 0>You could do that with the case of that, that the case of this thing, right.</v>

68
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.490
In the case of a black hole, however,

69
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.970
it really does hide the information because you can't get anything out of a

70
00:03:35.971 --> 00:03:36.511
black hole.

71
00:03:36.511 --> 00:03:39.570
You can't go in and don't pick the information and feed it to the outside.

72
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.380
So to see how black holes do carry entropy, like,

73
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.760
let me imagine a scenario, right?

74
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.240
Suppose you wake up one morning and there's a black hole at the bottom of your

75
00:03:48.241 --> 00:03:51.630
garden. Right. And okay. It's quite alarming.

76
00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:54.750
And probably it's going to sort of tell you apart,

77
00:03:54.751 --> 00:03:56.850
but it's sort of tidal effects if you get too close to it,

78
00:03:56.851 --> 00:04:01.350
but let's say you don't get too close. And the next day you wake up again,

79
00:04:01.351 --> 00:04:04.830
the black hole is still there, but it's grown by say the massive in elephants.

80
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.970
Okay. Now how would you know that it's swallowed an elephant?

81
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.310
Did it swallow an elephant or maybe did it swallow a car with the same mass or

82
00:04:14.311 --> 00:04:19.110
something else with the same mess? There's no way that you can know, right?

83
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.840
Because when you do a sort of measurements on a black hole,

84
00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:25.320
the only things that you can measure are its massive charge and its angular

85
00:04:25.321 --> 00:04:26.154
momentum.

86
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.540
So there's literally no way you can tell whether it was made by an elephant or

87
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.291
made by a car.

88
00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:34.020
There's no measurement you can do on that black hole that will tell you that it

89
00:04:34.021 --> 00:04:35.010
will look the same.

90
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.550
<v 1>Tony.</v>

91
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.170
W why is this not just a problem of access to the information

92
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.450
rather than the existence of the information.

93
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.320
<v 0>Ready? Okay. So if that was all I told you, then you'd say, yeah, that's,</v>

94
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.960
it's just hidden behind the black hole of I dived inside.

95
00:04:48.961 --> 00:04:51.930
I find that information, everything would be fine. It'd be no problem. Okay,

96
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.823
great.

97
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.530
The trouble is Hawking then told us that black holes actually radiate that

98
00:04:57.531 --> 00:04:59.010
they'll evaporate. Okay.

99
00:04:59.011 --> 00:05:02.310
So you have this process by which you think of pairs of particles being produced

100
00:05:02.311 --> 00:05:05.130
near the event horizon and those particles,

101
00:05:05.131 --> 00:05:08.700
one particle due to in certain principle might find itself just outside one,

102
00:05:08.701 --> 00:05:10.530
just inside the outside guy,

103
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.890
escapes the inside guy falls in and this black hole evaporates.

104
00:05:13.891 --> 00:05:17.790
It starts to lose its mass. That radiation that it produces,

105
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.940
it's really completely random in some sense. So,

106
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.140
so know at the event horizon where this, all this magic is happening, you know,

107
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:26.251
there's not any,

108
00:05:26.251 --> 00:05:28.770
it could be this particle that went out or it could be the other one that went

109
00:05:28.771 --> 00:05:30.950
out. It's totally random. The only thing that the,

110
00:05:30.951 --> 00:05:33.420
the radiation sees is the shape of the space time,

111
00:05:33.421 --> 00:05:35.490
the geometry of the space time from that radiation,

112
00:05:35.491 --> 00:05:37.140
you can't extract that there was a,

113
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.350
it was made from a car that hole was made from a car or that it was made from an

114
00:05:40.351 --> 00:05:42.210
elephant. You can't get that from the radiation.

115
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.140
And then eventually the black hole evaporates away completely.

116
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.890
And all you're left with is the radiation. Okay. Which I've just said,

117
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.160
and Hawking told us, doesn't contain the information that you need.

118
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.400
So the information is disappeared, which is disaster for quantum mechanics.

119
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:57.830
I've got one more.

120
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.650
<v 1>Uh, half-baked Brady theory as to how you could find that the information when I</v>

121
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:08.120
woke up on the second morning and the black hole is heavier,

122
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.070
could I not do a census of everything outside the black hole and say, Oh,

123
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:15.170
there's one less elephant in the solar system.

124
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.730
It must be an elephant that fell in.

125
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.910
<v 0>Um, no, no. Um, okay.</v>

126
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.450
If you have two regions of space that are separated from one another,

127
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.910
if you have a pure concept state over the whole space right then,

128
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.610
and then you separate them, the two regions,

129
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:35.650
there could be information in this region,

130
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.840
which relies on knowledge of this region and vice versa. Okay.

131
00:06:40.841 --> 00:06:42.280
So if you separate the two regions,

132
00:06:42.281 --> 00:06:45.310
you can have missing information in this and missing information in this,

133
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.210
but they kind of compensate for one another. They account for one another,

134
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.810
which is kind of what you're asking. Can I do that?

135
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.010
And that ought to be what happens. That absolutely ought to be what happens,

136
00:06:57.011 --> 00:07:00.460
but hockey's calculation suggested that it's not what happens. Okay.

137
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.830
So it's fair. It's a fair point. What you said. Yes.

138
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.970
Isn't the information just to see,

139
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.850
can I just sort of account for the missing information on one side versus the

140
00:07:06.851 --> 00:07:08.590
other side and everything takes care of itself.

141
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.880
That's what content mechanics demands that should be able to do in some sense,

142
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.480
Hawking said, well, here's the calculation. Show me how it's done.

143
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:17.703
I can't do it.

144
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.630
<v 1>All right then. So let's,</v>

145
00:07:19.631 --> 00:07:22.360
let's not get too bogged down in all my stupid questions.

146
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.100
Let's talk about what's actually happened.

147
00:07:24.101 --> 00:07:27.580
What's the news what's been happening recently. That's got you excited.

148
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.640
<v 0>If we're going to get to that, kind of tell you about Hawking's beds. Okay.</v>

149
00:07:30.641 --> 00:07:34.810
So Hawkings spent his whole life trying to solve this problem. Okay.

150
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.610
And he was convinced for time, that information was lost inside black holes.

151
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.780
And he had a human Kip Thorne who you probably know from the film,

152
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.920
interstellar had a bet with a press school from Caltech

153
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.830
over whether the information was lost on that. So Hawking him Fon said,

154
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.040
said that it would be lost. Press Gill said no, no, no, no, no, no.

155
00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:57.130
Don't be silly. Quantum mechanics is too precious. No way it's been lost.

156
00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.340
It's going to get lost. It will be surveilled survived somehow this information.

157
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:01.290
So how,

158
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:04.090
and spend a lot of time trying to figure out one way or another then became

159
00:08:04.091 --> 00:08:05.620
convinced it probably was survived,

160
00:08:05.621 --> 00:08:07.960
but couldn't work out how came up with some ideas,

161
00:08:07.961 --> 00:08:12.280
how to the point where he ended up paying the out the bets to press skill,

162
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:15.490
Kip, Thorne, they thought the Hawkins ideas weren't quite right. I mean,

163
00:08:15.491 --> 00:08:19.630
you refuse to pay the bats. Um, it sends out hoagies ideas weren't right.

164
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:25.150
Um, but over the years, people have become convinced that information was, uh,

165
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.900
you know, wasn't lost, but not really sure how it,

166
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.650
how it wasn't lost if you see what I mean. So then yeah. Right. What's the news.

167
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:37.660
We seem to figure it out how it's not lost. Okay. So.

168
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.880
<v 1>So information is presented to this.</v>

169
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.480
<v 0>Breakthrough has come from, from two teams, one on the East coast of America,</v>

170
00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:47.800
uh, centered around Princeton and one, one around Stanford on the West coast.

171
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:51.580
So the Princeton team did a really nice review just last week, actually,

172
00:08:51.581 --> 00:08:54.880
where they gave a really nice analogy for how, how this information is, is,

173
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:59.430
is preserved. Okay. So the story goes, you have, um, you have some,

174
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.350
some Valerie's, he's easy. He lives in a,

175
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:06.780
in a posh house and it's full of beautiful, extremely valuable paintings. Okay.

176
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.530
So he's um, but he has no money. Okay. So he, but he wants to,

177
00:09:10.531 --> 00:09:13.740
he wants to show off his shelf, his wealth, but he has no cash.

178
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.070
He's just got these paintings. He's really valuable paintings. So he says, okay,

179
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:21.030
then I'm going to borrow some money off the people of the town. Okay.

180
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:22.910
So he says, right, borrow some money off the people at town,

181
00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:27.420
get some cash that way. And as he he'll use the paintings as a guarantee,

182
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.480
okay. So he does that.

183
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:35.430
He gets this cash and he throws lavish parties, the people of the town,

184
00:09:35.431 --> 00:09:35.851
meanwhile,

185
00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:38.100
they no longer have any cash because they've lent it all to the guy in the

186
00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:41.220
house. Okay. So they're certainly not throwing lavish parties.

187
00:09:41.221 --> 00:09:44.430
They're living very frugally. So you look at this from the outside and you say,

188
00:09:44.431 --> 00:09:48.900
well, who's, who's um, who's the guys, the towns, people seem quite poor here.

189
00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:52.590
Right? They don't seem very rich, but of course that's not true. They are rich.

190
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.310
They kind of, because they, you know, they, they, they kind of own in a sense,

191
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.640
those paintings that are locked inside the house, they're their paintings.

192
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.270
And this is analogous to what's happening with the black hole.

193
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.530
So in the analogy, the house is the black hole. Okay.

194
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.170
The townspeople are like the radiation and the, um, the,

195
00:10:12.171 --> 00:10:13.560
the wealth of the townspeople.

196
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:18.630
It's the quantum information that's stored in that radiation. So very naively,

197
00:10:18.631 --> 00:10:21.510
you look at this and you think that the townspeople are poor or that the

198
00:10:21.511 --> 00:10:26.430
radiation has not doesn't have much quantum information, but actually it does.

199
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:29.730
Okay. It somehow got access to the interior of the black hole.

200
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:33.510
In the case of the analogy, the, the, the sort of towns,

201
00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.990
people actually have much more wealth than you can secretly see that by looking

202
00:10:36.991 --> 00:10:38.340
at maybe the record of the loan,

203
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.100
the record of the loan will show that they have some connection with the,

204
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.090
with the inside of the house. It's my elephant all over again.

205
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.940
Of course he had to be there. It had to be right,

206
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.970
but now let's see how it happened. This is great. This is,

207
00:10:49.971 --> 00:10:53.550
this is where it gets beautiful. How does that play out in the black hole case?

208
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:54.480
Okay.

209
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.680
How does the radiation make that connection to the interior of the black hole?

210
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.260
That it seems like you shouldn't be allowed that, right?

211
00:11:01.261 --> 00:11:04.500
Because this is violating locality and space and time,

212
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:06.690
but what happens is the following.

213
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.640
There's an Island forms inside the black hole. I've kind of,

214
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.190
I sort of read inside the black hole and they call it the Island.

215
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.300
And that kind of, you start to think of that, not as part of the black hole,

216
00:11:18.301 --> 00:11:20.490
but was part of the radiation itself.

217
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:25.950
The radiation makes a connection to this Island through a wormhole.

218
00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:30.450
I love wormholes. Right? That's how it makes it. So how do you,

219
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.890
how does the information leak out? Well,

220
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.440
what you would do is you would do some complicated

221
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.030
sorts of measurements and it can be exponentially complicated, right?

222
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.930
Measurements on the, on the Hawking radiation, right? And effectively,

223
00:11:42.931 --> 00:11:44.190
you're creating this wormhole,

224
00:11:44.191 --> 00:11:46.800
which then accesses the interior of the black hole and you're,

225
00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:48.390
and you can get the information out.

226
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:53.070
You can figure out whether it was made from it, an elephant or a car. Now,

227
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.840
wormholes, they're really hard to produce.

228
00:11:55.841 --> 00:12:00.550
You absolutely cannot produce them at all until the black hole is radiated

229
00:12:00.551 --> 00:12:04.750
away, roughly half its size, okay, it's passed this time called the page time.

230
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.250
But after that, you can start to create them and it gets easier to create them.

231
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:10.840
And actually, these,

232
00:12:10.841 --> 00:12:14.680
these guys have shown that in some simple toy models of gravity,

233
00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.180
these wormholes are there.

234
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:21.010
And actually they dominate the behavior at late times and Hawking never knew

235
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:23.860
about them. And that's why he made the wrong conclusion.

236
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.650
<v 1>To go back to the painting analogy. You told,</v>

237
00:12:28.651 --> 00:12:32.790
you told me when a black hole radiates, Hawking radiation.

238
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.470
It's a random app.

239
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:38.280
There's no control over what particles will happen to form on one side of the

240
00:12:38.281 --> 00:12:41.850
event, horizon or the other. And that's why information perhaps was being lost.

241
00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:46.380
And if we are going to attach that to the analogy of our rich painting owner,

242
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:51.000
surely the problem here is there's no control over whether he's going to pay

243
00:12:51.001 --> 00:12:53.130
back the loan, payback the guarantee,

244
00:12:53.131 --> 00:12:56.730
because the money coming back out to the townspeople has now been randomized.

245
00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.340
<v 0>Right. Okay. And, and, and here is the,</v>

246
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:01.590
it is difficult to get the information out in a black hole.

247
00:13:01.591 --> 00:13:05.700
And it might be very difficult to get the money back from the,

248
00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.660
from the town specified the doors locked, you know, set up a barricade,

249
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:14.220
but it's not impossible. It's there. Okay. It's there.

250
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.090
And so the way they and the guys outside can prove that, well, they say, look,

251
00:13:18.091 --> 00:13:20.970
here's the document here. Here is I made this loan.

252
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:25.320
If you're looking at black hole, you need to create this web hole to get in.

253
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:29.940
<v 1>So Tony, if we were creating a very, very fantasy situation here,</v>

254
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:34.080
and I was going to give you infinite, uh,

255
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:37.920
tools and measurement devices and spaceships and all the things you could

256
00:13:37.921 --> 00:13:40.410
possibly want. Right. And I said, all right,

257
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.860
I'm going to send you out to that black hole somewhere in the universe.

258
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:49.470
Tell me what went down, get the information back for me. All right.

259
00:13:49.471 --> 00:13:53.400
I want to know the story. What are you doing? Are you looking for like,

260
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:57.630
are you looking for a worm hole? Is the wormhole near the black hole? What,

261
00:13:57.631 --> 00:14:00.600
like, how would you go about this investigation? Yeah.

262
00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:04.530
<v 0>So it's really, so that's really, really difficult. Um, so firstly,</v>

263
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:08.700
if the black hole hasn't radiated enough of its, of its size away,

264
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.350
then you can't do it at all.

265
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:14.730
It's just impossible to get the information out if it's gone past a certain

266
00:14:14.731 --> 00:14:18.380
point. So you, you know, you can pass a certain stage past this page time, then,

267
00:14:18.381 --> 00:14:21.060
then indeed you can. Um, but it's,

268
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.710
it's exponentially difficult to do and it gets, it gets easier and easier,

269
00:14:25.711 --> 00:14:28.710
but it's still really, really hard to unpick that, to do.

270
00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.410
You basically have to do a quantum measurements of the radiation,

271
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:36.000
and you're trying to sort of extract the nature of the state.

272
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:38.730
Um, but it's really, really difficult to, you know,

273
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.240
maybe in terms of practical purposes, maybe impossible, but that doesn't matter.

274
00:14:42.241 --> 00:14:46.170
The point is, is in principle, is it possible? And it is possible.

275
00:14:46.171 --> 00:14:48.630
And they showed that these wormholes do actually dominate.

276
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:50.640
<v 1>In this in principle scenario,</v>

277
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:54.860
are you the worm to go inside the black hole and make measurements or measuring

278
00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:55.630
what comes out of the worm?

279
00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:56.530
<v 0>So if we're going to be really,</v>

280
00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.530
really precise about the way you can think of it is is this the following?

281
00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:02.740
So the radiation, um, you know, naively,

282
00:15:02.741 --> 00:15:04.710
it contains all this missing information. It's, it's,

283
00:15:04.711 --> 00:15:06.700
it's what we call a mixed state and quantum mechanics.

284
00:15:06.701 --> 00:15:10.120
It seems very impure in a sense, uh, all this missing,

285
00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.880
all these missing ingredients, what the wormhole does,

286
00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.570
it connects it with particles that were once in tangled with it,

287
00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.750
and that purifies the state.

288
00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.230
So the wormhole literally enables you to purify the radiation. So,

289
00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:25.960
so you've got all this stuff, which is all random over here.

290
00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.200
It used to be connected to stuff that was over here, right.

291
00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.460
But now it's been disconnected,

292
00:15:30.461 --> 00:15:34.000
but actually the wormhole reconnects them and purifies the quantum state.

293
00:15:34.001 --> 00:15:36.010
And so he actually has all the, it doesn't have any,

294
00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.080
it doesn't have the missing information that you thought it had.

295
00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:44.230
<v 1>Tony is this breakthrough a situation whereby it's like a</v>

296
00:15:44.231 --> 00:15:48.040
new discovery and an advance that could be used to, you know,

297
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.910
understand things better and maybe do things in the future?

298
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.840
Or is this more just a case of, we found a theoretical loophole.

299
00:15:55.841 --> 00:15:59.950
That means the current system we're clinging to still works. So don't worry.

300
00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.290
There's no exception go about your business.

301
00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.030
<v 0>Yeah. That's a really interesting question because I think,</v>

302
00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:07.870
I think one of the things about the black hole information paradox that people

303
00:16:07.871 --> 00:16:12.040
always said was the black all in information practice is so profound.

304
00:16:12.041 --> 00:16:16.510
It's so incredible that when we solve it and I'm going to say it,

305
00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.570
I think we have solved it. Okay. That when we solve it,

306
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:24.430
it will reveal something dramatic about space and time. That's yours.

307
00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.450
I'll say something about quantum gravity, something like that right now,

308
00:16:28.451 --> 00:16:31.630
I don't think that's happened. And the reason is, is so,

309
00:16:31.631 --> 00:16:35.140
so Hawking himself could have actually got this solution without any knowledge

310
00:16:35.141 --> 00:16:37.330
of quantum gravity. It doesn't rely on quantum gravity.

311
00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.870
One of the great ideas that came from looking at the information products was

312
00:16:40.871 --> 00:16:44.950
this idea of holography. Uh, you know, that that's actually,

313
00:16:44.951 --> 00:16:48.610
the information is stored on the boundary of space time. You know, that the,

314
00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:48.910
you know,

315
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.750
you can basically describe gravity by space of stuff on the boundary of space

316
00:16:52.751 --> 00:16:54.310
time, and that could come up.

317
00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.440
And that was certainly an inspiration for these ideas,

318
00:16:56.441 --> 00:16:59.470
but it doesn't rely on it. It doesn't rely on it. You didn't need any of that.

319
00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.070
So in a way it's, that makes it beautifully simple.

320
00:17:03.071 --> 00:17:05.260
The solution makes it feel right,

321
00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:10.750
but where's the amazing new insight that we were promised. Well, we don't know.

322
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:15.610
Maybe it's very early days yet. There is a little strange thing going on.

323
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:20.320
That's sitting in there, which is this, this idea that, um,

324
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.940
there's almost like a randomness to Quantico suggest there might be a

325
00:17:24.941 --> 00:17:28.810
randomness to quantum gravity that, that when you talk about quantum gravity,

326
00:17:28.811 --> 00:17:31.510
maybe the theory, isn't just one theory.

327
00:17:31.511 --> 00:17:35.140
It might be like what we call an ensemble of theories, the theories itself,

328
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.980
there's a little sort of technical subtlety in there in terms of the kinds of

329
00:17:38.981 --> 00:17:42.880
theories they played with to solve this. There's called JT gravity,

330
00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:44.440
which have this property,

331
00:17:44.441 --> 00:17:49.230
but is that something that you're going to need for the sort of extended to sort

332
00:17:49.231 --> 00:17:52.290
of fall four dimensional general relativity and so on? Maybe

333
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.570
we don't know that might be the sort of little smoking on that saying, ah,

334
00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.830
that's the really, that's the nugget that's going to take us,

335
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.600
give us that sort of, you know, what we were promised, uh, from the,

336
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.220
from a solution to the information paradox.

337
00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:09.110
<v 1>When you look through what they've published and what they've discovered, what,</v>

338
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:13.850
what do you think the leap or the clever thing they thought of was that all the

339
00:18:13.851 --> 00:18:17.300
men and women before didn't think of, like, what's the thing you look at and go,

340
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:20.090
ah, yes. Clever.

341
00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:23.690
<v 0>As ever. It's not just one thing, right. I've talked about.</v>

342
00:18:23.691 --> 00:18:26.660
I mentioned the holographic principle, the idea that, that, that all this,

343
00:18:26.661 --> 00:18:30.050
that you can describe gravity with a theory on the boundary of the space-time,

344
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:35.030
that's clearly been a major inspiration of major ingredients in terms of

345
00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:36.860
understanding in the end, we didn't need it,

346
00:18:36.861 --> 00:18:41.450
but in getting there in the journey, it was crucially important. Um,

347
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:44.810
there was a new way of thinking about entropy, which was,

348
00:18:44.811 --> 00:18:49.400
came from these guys Ryo and tuck unagi. Um, that was really important,

349
00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.950
but actually I want to highlight the contribution of, of,

350
00:18:51.951 --> 00:18:55.460
of one guy in particular who's um, is a young English guy.

351
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.790
And I'm not just saying that because I'm biased. Right. Um, but he's, uh,

352
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.360
he's actually just a PhD student at Stanford, but actually his work,

353
00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.050
this guy called Jeff Pennington, his work, um, that he did it.

354
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:09.350
Some of it she did on his own was really sort of a prelim to a lot of this.

355
00:19:09.351 --> 00:19:12.830
And then he's now on the papers with the, that finally seemed to have solved it,

356
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.730
but it was the work he was doing before, seems to be really,

357
00:19:16.731 --> 00:19:18.230
really important as well.

358
00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.920
So in a way it's like the new kid on the block just finally sent everybody over

359
00:19:21.921 --> 00:19:23.720
the line. And, um,

360
00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:28.220
I think we've got an absolute star in the making there, if I'm honest. Um,

361
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:32.450
and funnily enough, I was actually, I had some discussions with him and, uh,

362
00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.840
turns out he, he lived around the corner from,

363
00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:40.650
from where Emma Watson went to school now and Watson who plays Hermione in

364
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.540
Harry Potter films. Uh, I think that the sisters may,

365
00:19:44.541 --> 00:19:47.150
his sister may have hung around in a similar circle or something,

366
00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.770
but it sort of makes me laugh. It's like,

367
00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:52.850
did she know there was a real wizard actually just around the corner.

368
00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:57.560
<v 1>You mentioned that wormholes have been a key part of this.</v>

369
00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:01.250
What is a wormhole? I always thought a wormhole is somewhere where like,

370
00:20:01.251 --> 00:20:04.600
you know, you put your hand in the hole here in, on earth and,

371
00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:07.580
and it comes out on the other side of the universe or something that had like

372
00:20:07.581 --> 00:20:10.610
these like ultimate shortcuts. Am I right?

373
00:20:10.611 --> 00:20:12.220
Or are they something a bit more technical?

374
00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:16.130
<v 0>Exactly what it is. Of course, if we're going to be brutally honest, um,</v>

375
00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.890
these calculations are not really done in space time,

376
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.240
they're done in space space.

377
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:23.390
You've actually flipped 10 time into imaginary time.

378
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:24.950
That's how you do these calculations.

379
00:20:24.951 --> 00:20:29.000
So these are really wormholes in those scenarios. Um,

380
00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.550
it's a sign of technical detail that I, I, you know,

381
00:20:31.551 --> 00:20:34.760
I don't want to get bogged down in. Um, but yeah,

382
00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:37.550
it's exactly what you would normally think of a worst based time where I'm at

383
00:20:37.551 --> 00:20:38.600
least there's something like that.

384
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:41.030
Something that connects to regions of space and these calculations,

385
00:20:41.031 --> 00:20:42.800
it's connecting to regions of space,

386
00:20:42.801 --> 00:20:44.510
but there is no time in these settles because you've,

387
00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:48.210
you've gone to imaginary time. Um, but yeah, that's, that's.

388
00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.980
<v 2>That's exactly what they are. Imaginary time.</v>

389
00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:53.890
Thanks for dropping that bomb shot right at the end. Well,

390
00:20:53.891 --> 00:20:57.070
there's all these details, right? You do that. I spent two days each,

391
00:20:57.071 --> 00:21:01.960
I don't pick them the extra dimensions angle.

392
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:02.880
Okay.

393
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.530
<v 0>The difference between those sorts of black holes,</v>

394
00:21:04.531 --> 00:21:08.640
the astrophysical black holes and the kind that you might produce, the LHC, uh,

395
00:21:08.641 --> 00:21:11.970
those are, those are very large. They're very large black holes. Okay.

396
00:21:11.971 --> 00:21:14.640
They've been formed from Stella collapsed, you know,

397
00:21:14.641 --> 00:21:17.580
death of a star collapses and forms of black holes.
