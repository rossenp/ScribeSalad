1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.050
<v 0>So it's that time of the year when they give out the Nobel prizes and the press</v>

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.930
release has recently come out for the Nobel prize in physics,

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.610
it's actually split into two parts.

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.490
Half of it goes to Arthur Ashkin and the other half goes to Gerard and

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.340
Donna Strickland and each, she has an interesting,

6
00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:19.340
personal aspect of their asking is actually the oldest person ever to win a

7
00:00:19.341 --> 00:00:24.230
Nobel prize at 96. Wow, exactly. Yeah, pretty impressive. And, uh,

8
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.150
Donna Strickland is somewhat,

9
00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:30.800
depressingly only the third woman ever to share the Nobel prize the first in

10
00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:31.970
55 years.

11
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.240
And the other interesting thing is that the work that she won the prize for,

12
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.440
she won when she was a PhD student. So this is how the, uh, Gerald Maduro,

13
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.460
who was her supervisor,

14
00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:44.840
and this was what she was doing as a PhD student and traditionally PhD students

15
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.560
sort of been excluded from the Nobel prize famously Jocelyn bulb Grinnell.

16
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.440
Didn't get the Nobel prize for the work that she did as a PhD student,

17
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.690
but her supervisor did, for example, uh,

18
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.660
clearly the Nobel prize committee is moving with the times a bit because there's

19
00:00:56.661 --> 00:01:00.140
two applications of laser physics that they got the prizes for. Fortunately,

20
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:03.110
a sufficient laser physics that even an astronomer can kind of understand it.

21
00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:05.360
And actually it's really neat. We start with Arthur Ashkin.

22
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.320
He won it for the optical tweezers and their application to biological systems.

23
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.480
So he invented the thing called optical tweezers.

24
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.170
So he discovered a way of using a laser as a pair of incredibly sensitive

25
00:01:15.171 --> 00:01:18.590
tweezers. The light can pick things up,

26
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.710
it can hold them very well, very carefully, very,

27
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:25.850
very did it delicately and can feel any kind of tug. So it's a very,

28
00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:29.000
like a very sensitive way of measuring when things are being pulled,

29
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:30.950
for example. Um, and it's, uh,

30
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.350
it's a really clever piece of physics that you use to do that.

31
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.330
What he was doing is he would take a laser beam and take a very small glass or

32
00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:39.170
plastic sphere,

33
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.260
not that much larger than the wavelengths of light and put it in the laser beam.

34
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.190
And it turns out that a little plastic sphere or glass fair will stay in the

35
00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:49.250
laser beam when you place it there. And the physics is quite neat for that.

36
00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:51.770
So let me show you the picture of what's going on. So here's a laser beam,

37
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.170
and the only thing you really need to know about this laser beam is that it's

38
00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:56.000
brighter in the middle, more intense in the middle,

39
00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:58.880
and then gets fainter as you work your way out towards the edges of the beam

40
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.140
thing called a Gaussian beam.

41
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.450
It just basically means it's brightest in the middle and here's our little

42
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:04.730
sphere. And the dotted line here shows the midline.

43
00:02:04.731 --> 00:02:07.250
So this little sphere has kind of be displaced upwards of it.

44
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.810
And you can see that what happens as the laser light interacts with this little,

45
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.640
fairly transparent sphere as it goes through it, but it gets refracted.

46
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.370
And we've actually talked about this when we did the physics of rainbows and

47
00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:17.061
those kinds of things,

48
00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:20.240
where we talked about light going through liquid drops in that case,

49
00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:22.370
but it's the same story. It's just basically the,

50
00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:24.590
the little sphere has a different refractive index.

51
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.470
So that bends the light as it goes through this bit of the light gets bent

52
00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:30.350
upwards. And the bit that goes, the other side gets bent downwards,

53
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.700
but because the light was more intense towards the middle of the beam, more,

54
00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:36.860
the light gets bent upwards and gets that downwards,

55
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.330
light carries momentum with it.

56
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.540
And that means the momentum of the light going upwards is more than the momentum

57
00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:43.070
of the light going downwards. In other words,

58
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:46.580
there's a net momentum upwards for the light, but momentum has to be conserved.

59
00:02:46.581 --> 00:02:49.070
So if the light's aquarium momentum upwards,

60
00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:52.520
that means the little glass fear has to be a requirement and downwards.

61
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.120
So that pushes it back towards the middle of the beam. Conversely,

62
00:02:56.121 --> 00:02:57.740
if it had been displaced in the other direction,

63
00:02:57.741 --> 00:03:00.760
exactly the opposite occurs more like it gets bent downwards against bent

64
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:03.910
upwards. That means there's more momentum on the light going downwards.

65
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:06.420
That means that the little sphere has to acquire momentum upwards.

66
00:03:06.421 --> 00:03:10.270
So the net effect of this is that the little sphere always moved back towards

67
00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:12.070
the middle of the beam. If it starts to drift away,

68
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.110
there's a net kind of restoring force. And in that case,

69
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:16.570
it's very like a little, little spring balance. You know, if you pull it,

70
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.630
the spring will tug you back to where you started and if you squeeze it,

71
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:21.850
then it'll push you back. It's the same story.

72
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:24.610
And you can use this in exactly the same way as you use a spring balance to

73
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:26.410
measure forces. You can actually see how,

74
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.970
if you apply a force to that little sphere,

75
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.570
how far it gets displaced until those forces balance out.

76
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.070
<v 1>Does that mean you can only use these tweezers with objects that refract light?</v>

77
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.240
<v 0>So the neat thing then that Ashkin and his collaborators went on to do is you</v>

78
00:03:39.241 --> 00:03:42.300
can actually glue the end of a molecule to one of these little spheres.

79
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.810
So he did experiments with things like DNA to find out how stretchy it is by

80
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.260
essentially doing one end of it to one of these fears and seeing how much the

81
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.090
little sphere was tugged by the DNA.

82
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.940
So you use the sphere just as something that you would attach something else to.

83
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.210
Now, there's one further subtlety in this, which is, as we said,

84
00:03:57.211 --> 00:04:00.000
the light carries momentum. Some of that light gets refracted,

85
00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:01.980
but some of it actually gets absorbed by the sphere.

86
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.100
That means that there's a transfer of momentum from the light to the sphere.

87
00:04:05.101 --> 00:04:07.560
So there's a tendency for the sphere to get pushed along the beam.

88
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.921
And of course,

89
00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:10.890
what we want here is the little sphere to stay in the same place and we can do

90
00:04:10.891 --> 00:04:13.380
experiments with it. So you need somehow to stop the sphere,

91
00:04:13.381 --> 00:04:15.810
moving along the beam, the very early experiments,

92
00:04:15.811 --> 00:04:18.300
they found a very simple way of stopping the sphere, moving on to the beam,

93
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.650
which is that if you do the experiment this way up, then the,

94
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.990
the lights trying to push the sphere up and gravity is trying to pull the sphere

95
00:04:24.991 --> 00:04:29.220
down. And so the actually you can choose the brightness of your light to exactly

96
00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:30.090
balance it at there.

97
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.600
Now it turns out that doesn't work particularly well because the thing's a bit

98
00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:36.300
unstable and it'll tend to go drift one way or the other.

99
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.510
And so what asked you to discovered was a much subtler way of doing the same

100
00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:42.810
thing instead of having the light, just as a parallel beam,

101
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.250
as we were shown before, what he actually did was got a very strong lens,

102
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.430
like a microscope lens. That means that the light is in a very convergent beam.

103
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.340
So the light's actually converging on the sphere. And then you can see, again,

104
00:04:53.341 --> 00:04:56.040
the light still gets refracted as it comes through and comes out the other side.

105
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.700
But you can see that the light going out is traveling more along the beam than

106
00:04:59.701 --> 00:05:01.470
the light that was coming in. And the light was coming in was,

107
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.270
was at a steeper angle. So again,

108
00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:06.660
the light coming out actually has more momentum in this direction than the light

109
00:05:06.661 --> 00:05:07.350
coming in.

110
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.660
Cause the light coming in wasn't really traveling in that direction so much.

111
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.081
Again,

112
00:05:10.081 --> 00:05:13.170
that means there's been a change in momentum that there is now more momentum for

113
00:05:13.171 --> 00:05:16.020
the light traveling along the beam. Momentum has to be conserved.

114
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.340
That means that sort of net transfer of momentum pushes the sphere back in the

115
00:05:20.341 --> 00:05:24.030
opposite direction. So you use the two properties of the light, the refraction,

116
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.950
and that conservation of momentum there,

117
00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:28.560
which tends to pull the sphere back towards the lens here.

118
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.460
And the light's kind of being absorbed by this fear trend, push it along.

119
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.620
Those two effects, balance each other out. And again,

120
00:05:34.621 --> 00:05:35.880
the sphere will stay in a fixed point.

121
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.800
<v 1>If the light isn't hitting or interacting or physically touching the sphere,</v>

122
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.110
how is the message getting to the sphere,

123
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.960
a sphere you've got to follow the rules here,

124
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.020
make sure you move this way or that way. How, how are the two communicating.

125
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.390
<v 0>But it clearly is interacting with the sphere, right?</v>

126
00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:54.210
Because actually somehow the light comes in in one direction,

127
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.640
it comes out in another direction. And so for whatever,

128
00:05:56.641 --> 00:06:00.710
the of interaction between that electromagnetic wave and the sphere actually is,

129
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:02.720
and in detail, it's immensely complicated.

130
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.830
It has to have been interacting for it to have actually changed its direction.

131
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.220
And so in order for momentum to be conserved in the universe,

132
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:12.800
that means that this fear needs to be pushed back in the opposite direction.

133
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.170
<v 1>So there is, there is a when light hits it, there's like a physical</v>

134
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.340
react, like a physical collision.

135
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.270
<v 0>There is a physical, yeah, exactly. I mean, you know,</v>

136
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.460
there's this idea of creating solar sales,

137
00:06:24.461 --> 00:06:27.130
where you actually have a large light gathering sail,

138
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.770
which absorbs sunlight and that will push the sale along.

139
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.270
So this is exactly the same thing that,

140
00:06:31.271 --> 00:06:33.580
that interaction where the sphere is pushing it around.

141
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.030
<v 1>This Nobel prize, a triumph of life, an incredible idea,</v>

142
00:06:37.031 --> 00:06:41.650
or what seems like it may have been some very, very good experiment making,

143
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.040
like it seems like it would have been very hard to engineer and make this.

144
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.840
<v 0>I think it's both actually it was, you know,</v>

145
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.350
it was a brilliant idea and somebody actually had the technical skills to make

146
00:06:50.351 --> 00:06:53.800
it work and to think out through all these details as to how to, you know,

147
00:06:53.801 --> 00:06:56.710
make it not traveling along the beam, make it not move backwards and forwards,

148
00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:58.960
um, and just set the whole system up.

149
00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.750
So it's a combination of a very clever idea and then actually having the

150
00:07:01.751 --> 00:07:03.010
technical skills to make it work.

151
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.530
<v 1>Well with the name tweezers, I get the impression,</v>

152
00:07:05.531 --> 00:07:07.960
this was like a useful tool who uses these tweezers.

153
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.470
<v 0>All sorts of people. So Ashlyn's original work was in biology,</v>

154
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.870
but actually I have a, a much more recent example.

155
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.980
So people are actually using these optical tweezers to try and see whether

156
00:07:17.981 --> 00:07:20.950
Newton's laws of gravity are actually modified on very small scales.

157
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.390
It's traditionally very hard to gravity experiments on very small scales because

158
00:07:25.391 --> 00:07:28.540
gravity is a very weak force. And if you're doing things on very small scales,

159
00:07:28.541 --> 00:07:29.440
kind of by definition,

160
00:07:29.441 --> 00:07:32.200
you have quite small masses in order to get them that close together,

161
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.240
which means the effects are pretty small.

162
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:38.620
These tweezers are so incredibly sensitive that they can actually measure these

163
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.890
gravitational effects of the, in this case.

164
00:07:41.891 --> 00:07:44.110
What you do is you create a little canter lever here.

165
00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.350
So just a little diving platform and then a little sphere here,

166
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.530
and you can measure the gravitational interaction between these two things.

167
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:51.011
And see,

168
00:07:51.011 --> 00:07:54.700
as you move this little sphere around by just moving the laser beam around,

169
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.420
see how the force of gravity changes as you move the sphere closer and further

170
00:07:58.421 --> 00:08:00.010
away from the canter lever to see it.

171
00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:02.860
Newton's laws are actually a byte or there's extra physics that we need to

172
00:08:02.861 --> 00:08:06.130
introduce either reassuringly or depressingly depending on your perspective,

173
00:08:06.131 --> 00:08:07.030
it looks like there isn't any,

174
00:08:07.031 --> 00:08:09.730
or at least at the sensitivity that they've been able to do these measurements,

175
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.240
but this is the first time people are really been studying gravity on these

176
00:08:13.241 --> 00:08:14.350
incredibly tiny scales.

177
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.960
<v 1>Okay. He can keep his Nobel prize.</v>

178
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.690
<v 0>Oh, you're too kind. Yeah. So that's one half.</v>

179
00:08:19.691 --> 00:08:24.220
So then the other half is Jerome Muro and Donna Strickland for their method of

180
00:08:24.221 --> 00:08:27.370
generating high-intensity ultra short optical pulses.

181
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.430
So this is taking laser light and making very, very intense,

182
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:31.810
very short pulses of light,

183
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.470
which turns out to be a non-trivial thing to do because,

184
00:08:35.471 --> 00:08:37.570
so there are lots of ways that we have to amplify light.

185
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.830
It turns out if you take,

186
00:08:38.831 --> 00:08:43.060
say a very short pulse of laser light and you feed it into an amplifier,

187
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.440
you can make a brighter pulse of light.

188
00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:46.750
If you start with a very bright pulse of light, which is what you want,

189
00:08:46.751 --> 00:08:48.430
if you want an extremely bright of light,

190
00:08:48.431 --> 00:08:51.250
when it's come out the other side of the amplifier and you just put it into an

191
00:08:51.251 --> 00:08:52.084
amplifier,

192
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:56.040
you melt the amplifier because there's so much intensity of that light already,

193
00:08:56.041 --> 00:08:59.010
as it goes in, that is just too much for an amplifier to handle.

194
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:03.030
So there's kind of a fundamental limit as to how much you can amplify light in

195
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:06.120
using a conventional amplifier in that conventional way. So what they did,

196
00:09:06.121 --> 00:09:07.560
so I need to, re-introduce again,

197
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:09.720
another piece of physics that we've talked about in the past.

198
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.730
If you want to make a short pulse of light,

199
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.910
you actually need to add together a whole bunch of different wavelengths of

200
00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:17.880
light. This isn't a single wavelength of light, even though it looks like it is,

201
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.500
cause you can kind of see a single wave there.

202
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:22.320
The only thing that's really a single wavelength is a sine wave.

203
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.750
And this clearly isn't a sine wave to make something like this,

204
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:25.890
you have to add it together.

205
00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:29.130
A whole bunch of sine waves are slightly different frequencies. And the shorter,

206
00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:31.410
the pulse of the light is the more the range of frequencies.

207
00:09:31.411 --> 00:09:32.190
You have their act together.

208
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.310
So a short pulse of light actually contains light of lots of different

209
00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:37.020
wavelengths, lots of different colors. So,

210
00:09:37.021 --> 00:09:41.550
and that was the fact that they exploited in order to actually amplify a very

211
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:44.400
short pulse of light in a very clever way. Here is schematically.

212
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.080
Here's our initial pulse of light.

213
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.110
And we know we can't feed that straight into our amplifier because it will melt

214
00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:49.740
the amplifier.

215
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.670
So what they did is they feed it into a device that kind of spreads those

216
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.170
different colors out in time.

217
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.960
The red light gets to the front and the blue light gets to the back.

218
00:09:57.961 --> 00:10:00.900
So basically you just have a system of gratings or something,

219
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:03.630
which as you pass the light through the red light gets through first and the

220
00:10:03.631 --> 00:10:06.420
blue light gets through lost. So now we spread the pulse out in time.

221
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.370
Then you feed that into the amplifier.

222
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.880
And of course that none of it's particularly bright at this point,

223
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:12.450
cause we've spread all that energy out.

224
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.420
And so we can amplify that without melting our amplifier.

225
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.840
Then you feed it into a gizmo, which just reverses that spreading out.

226
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:20.490
So we put everything back together again,

227
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.210
and you end up with a whacking great bright pulse, right? So elegant,

228
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.103
it's really brilliant.

229
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:30.170
<v 1>Why do you have to have this post break the posts apart and then put it back</v>

230
00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.600
together? Why not put into constituent parts in the first place?

231
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:33.621
<v 0>Because I actually,</v>

232
00:10:33.621 --> 00:10:37.160
the easiest part of making those constituent parts is by starting with a smaller

233
00:10:37.161 --> 00:10:39.770
pulse and splitting it up you're right in principle,

234
00:10:39.771 --> 00:10:43.010
you could create each separately, but it would be incredibly fiddly to do.

235
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:44.270
Whereas here it's kind of,

236
00:10:44.271 --> 00:10:47.570
you're automatically getting things in the right combination because you know,

237
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:51.110
it's, it combines to create a single little pulse. And then so, you know,

238
00:10:51.111 --> 00:10:53.870
by the end of it, it's going to combine a great one whacking big pulse.

239
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.450
This is a piece of technology that actually quite a lot of people have

240
00:10:56.451 --> 00:10:56.931
encountered.

241
00:10:56.931 --> 00:11:00.710
If you've ever had corrective laser eye surgery to strengthen their lasers,

242
00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.990
they're using the vaporized bits of your cornea.

243
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.080
The way they can actually make the pulse is strong enough to do that is because

244
00:11:06.081 --> 00:11:07.070
it uses this technology.

245
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.960
<v 1>The thing that splits them apart,</v>

246
00:11:08.961 --> 00:11:12.290
was that like an awesome piece of technology or was it just the notion of

247
00:11:12.291 --> 00:11:13.810
splitting apart? That was the clever.

248
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.480
<v 0>It was the notion or the, you know, the, the, the S the frequency,</v>

249
00:11:17.481 --> 00:11:20.870
splitter and frequency of combined has existed before they were just the people

250
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.240
who thought, if we do this, we can solve a problem.

251
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.540
So they just took sort of more or less off the shelf things and put them

252
00:11:26.541 --> 00:11:28.820
together in a way that no one had thought to put them together before.

253
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.850
<v 1>Oh, that keeps hope for people. That me, that I could win a Nobel prize.</v>

254
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.700
<v 0>Yeah. Just go through your cupboards and see if there's anything there.</v>

255
00:11:34.701 --> 00:11:36.860
You can stick together to make something that no one's thought of before.

256
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:41.570
Unfortunately, of all the many ways of sticking things together, you know, 99.9,

257
00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.190
nine, 9% of them are complete rubbish.

258
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.680
And it's only once in a while you hit one of these genius ideas.

259
00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.050
<v 1>You happy with these, this year's Nobel prizes. I mean,</v>

260
00:11:48.051 --> 00:11:49.280
you would have preferred an astronomer.

261
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.460
<v 0>Well, no, actually I, you know what? I really like it, firstly,</v>

262
00:11:52.461 --> 00:11:54.520
they went to people this year. That's a good thing.

263
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.520
Both of these ideas are so neat. I just, it's one of those things.

264
00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.880
The fact that you can explain them in a five minute video and really, you know,

265
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.450
I understand what the physics was, the fact that you come away from it thinking,

266
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:05.770
well, I could have thought of that.

267
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.010
Those to my mind are the best kind of discoveries because yes,

268
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:09.970
anyone could have thought of that.

269
00:12:09.971 --> 00:12:13.360
But nobody did until these people came along and were able to make that leap of

270
00:12:13.361 --> 00:12:14.650
doing something completely different.

271
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.100
That's why I really liked this kind of price that it's so simple.

272
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:20.230
But so because of that is so elegant.

273
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.000
