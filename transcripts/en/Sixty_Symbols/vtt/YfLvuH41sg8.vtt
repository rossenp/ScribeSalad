00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.530
<v 0>What's this about today. So I wanted to talk about a paper should just come out.</v>

2
00:00:04.531 --> 00:00:08.670
It's entitled gravitational wave constraints on the equatorial Ellipta city of

3
00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:10.800
millisecond pulsars the front page of it,

4
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:14.040
as well as the title is basically all authors. And in fact,

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.040
if I turn to the second page, that's all authors too.

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.570
And if I turn to the third page, that's all authors. Wow.

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.320
The reason why it's so many authors is because it's one of the papers from LIGO

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.740
and Virgo. So the gravitational wave detection consortium,

9
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.280
and actually this is about not detecting gravitational waves and it turns out

10
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:35.550
sometimes not detecting gravitational waves is as interesting as detecting them.

11
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.830
They're looking at neutron stars pulse.

12
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.080
So these are these very compact stellar remnants where the whole massive star up

13
00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:46.500
to a couple of solar masses is pressed down into a region about 20 kilometers

14
00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:49.710
across so tiny little objects that are leftover when stars blow up.

15
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.811
<v 1>Professor,</v>

16
00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:54.080
is there a difference between a neutron star and a pollster are all neutron

17
00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:55.310
stars, also a upholster.

18
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.600
<v 0>So all pulsars are neutron stars, but not all neutron stars are Paul Saul.</v>

19
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.700
So Paul saws are the ones we can see.

20
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.670
And the reason why we can see them is because these objects are rotating

21
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.100
generally quite fast. They have a magnetic field.

22
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.950
If that made me feel this sort of misaligned with the rotation,

23
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.840
then you get basically a lighthouse effect.

24
00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:15.050
You have the light that's being produced along the magnetic field lines through

25
00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:17.660
a process called synchrotron. And as the thing spins around,

26
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.270
you basically see the flashes of light as it goes past.

27
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.720
And so that's how they were first detected by Jocelyn bell Burnell,

28
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.030
where she detected these very regular pulses,

29
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.330
which are from these flashes of light as the neutron stars rotating.

30
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.750
If it turns out that the lighthouse beam happens not to be pointed in our

31
00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:34.160
direction, then we won't see it.

32
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.900
And so basically this there'll be a neutron star,

33
00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:38.120
but we won't see it as a Pulser. But anyway,

34
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.810
some of them are pulsars and they're spinning some of them very fast.

35
00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:43.280
Some of them, a thousand times a second,

36
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.400
the things called millisecond pulse horse. I mean, they are mind blowing things,

37
00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:46.551
right?

38
00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:49.850
You've got several times the mass of the sun squashed down into a region 20

39
00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:52.640
kilometers across rotating up to a thousand times a second,

40
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.020
quite phenomenal objects.

41
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.520
But one consequence of that is that you might expect them to radiate

42
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.080
gravitational waves. Now, if they're exactly symmetrical, they won't.

43
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.790
Because if you think about it, if you had something,

44
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.320
which is actually just kind of completely say it was feral,

45
00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:10.940
or even it was somewhat flattened. If it's not actually sort of,

46
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.980
if it's just rotating around that axis,

47
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.490
then the shape doesn't change at all in the, in three dimensions,

48
00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:19.610
it just kind of rotates around, which means that the gravitational field,

49
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.350
the things producing really doesn't change either.

50
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.720
Whereas if it were kind of very lopsided,

51
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.140
as it rotated around the shape would kind of change in the sky,

52
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.300
which means its gravitational field would change.

53
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.050
And one of the consequences of that is that it within radiate gravitational

54
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:34.490
waves, you can calculate, well,

55
00:02:34.491 --> 00:02:36.770
how much by where gravitational waves would it radiate?

56
00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:38.000
The answer is not a huge amount.

57
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.730
It's nothing like the things that they'd been detecting with LIGO. Like,

58
00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:40.911
you know,

59
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:43.820
these merging neutron stars and black holes and things which produce these

60
00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:46.820
enormous bursts of gravitational waves, you might think, well, you know,

61
00:02:46.821 --> 00:02:49.490
they can only just detect these much more spectacular events.

62
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.280
How could they hope to detect one of these neutron stars?

63
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.140
The answer is they know where to look because we know exactly what the period of

64
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.820
rotation of these things are. Cause if it's a,

65
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.380
Pulser just measure the time between the pulses. And so for example,

66
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.330
the crab pulse all goes round 30 times a second, 30 Hertz. And from that,

67
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.850
and it turns out the gravitational waves are radiated at twice the frequency of

68
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:12.880
the rotation period. So inconveniently, it would actually be 60 Hertz,

69
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.760
which is the electricity frequency of a fair part of the world,

70
00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:17.590
which turns out to be a major source of interference.

71
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:20.290
So you can't actually detect it or it's very hard to detect the craft balsa,

72
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.590
but other pulsars have less inconvenient frequencies that they're rotating it.

73
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.850
So then you know exactly what frequency you look at.

74
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.830
You can just kind of add up all the data and just search at that one frequency

75
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:31.210
to say, is there anything going on?

76
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:33.820
If I combine all the data together at that one frequency,

77
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.300
it's a little bit more complicated because it could be, for example,

78
00:03:37.301 --> 00:03:39.040
if the thing really worth slightly lopsided,

79
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:41.560
it might be kind of processing around as well as rotating.

80
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.310
We've changed the frequency a little bit. It could be that the interior,

81
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:48.220
the neutron star is actually rotating at a slightly different speed from the

82
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:51.010
exterior. It could be kind of slushy and around faster in the interior,

83
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.110
which again would change the frequency of it.

84
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.140
So you have to search around a little bit infrequency, but you know,

85
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.560
pretty much exactly where to look. So they looked in all these places.

86
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:01.030
They've now got lots of data from Lego,

87
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:04.030
from Virgo that they they're able to look to see if there are any emissions from

88
00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:05.890
these neutron stars. The answer is there isn't any,

89
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.790
they were able to put really strong upper limits on how much gravitational waves

90
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:10.061
there are.

91
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:13.390
And hence indirectly that tells you how isometric the pulse all is allowed to

92
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:16.120
be. And the answer is absolutely tiny, right?

93
00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:21.100
It turns out if you wanted to make a pulse saw lopsided if you made it lopsided.

94
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:24.460
So I suppose if you had an exactly spherical neutron star, 20 kilometers across,

95
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.930
if you distorted one side of it, literally by a hair's breadth.

96
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.700
So by the width of a human hair,

97
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.110
that would create enough asymmetry that with the sensitivity they had,

98
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:38.140
they'd have been able to detect it. Huh? So they know to,

99
00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:42.550
within a hair's breadth, these neutron stars have to be exactly symmetric.

100
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.650
<v 1>So professor, I presume they looked at a few neutron stars,</v>

101
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.260
not just one there's about half a dozen, maybe in this one.

102
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.970
The thing I was thinking when you first started telling me about this was surely

103
00:04:53.971 --> 00:04:56.160
something spinning that fast.

104
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.430
I would have thought maybe there'll be something about that process that would

105
00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:02.880
make it symmetrical. And the fact that all of them are symmetrical. I mean,

106
00:05:02.881 --> 00:05:04.860
is it a cause or an effect I guess is what I'm saying?

107
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.010
<v 0>It's a con I mean, I think even if they weren't spinning,</v>

108
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.460
they'd still end up very symmetrical because the pool of that, I mean,

109
00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:13.830
they're basically held together by nuclear forces, right?

110
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.250
And those sorts of forces are so strong that they will actually pull everything

111
00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:20.580
in, in a very symmetric fashion, but being able to measure it, you know,

112
00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:25.080
to within a hair's breadth for a pulse on it really shows quite how amazingly

113
00:05:25.081 --> 00:05:26.070
symmetric, they really are.

114
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.580
<v 1>Another way of saying this is that they would have a very smooth surface or</v>

115
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.970
yeah.

116
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.730
<v 0>Absolutely. And you know, smoother than the proverbial baby's bottom,</v>

117
00:05:32.731 --> 00:05:35.820
they really are. It has to be absolutely smooth because any little ripples, the,

118
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.180
where will create those kinds of asymmetries that they'd be able to detect in

119
00:05:39.181 --> 00:05:40.890
gravitational waves smoother.

120
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:41.880
<v 1>Than a billiard ball.</v>

121
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.880
<v 0>Way, way, way smoother than a billionaire.</v>

122
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.980
<v 1>Can we make things that smooth is this smoother than humans can make? Or,</v>

123
00:05:49.981 --> 00:05:51.330
you know, you hear things about these, you know,

124
00:05:51.331 --> 00:05:54.090
these spheres of Silicon and stuff like that. And.

125
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.730
<v 0>That's a very good question. I honestly don't know.</v>

126
00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:58.670
I'd have to do the calculation to see. Yeah. I mean, when the,

127
00:05:58.671 --> 00:05:59.181
one of the things,

128
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:02.300
when they were thinking about redefining the kilogram was about making

129
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:06.380
incredibly smooth spheres of select Silicon to within kind of a single atom.

130
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.800
And I'd have to do the calculation to figure out whether or not this is smoother

131
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:12.650
than that. But I wouldn't be surprised if it was cause it, you know, here,

132
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:15.140
we're talking about 20 kilometers across on a hair's breadth.

133
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.750
So it's really is a tiny perturbation.

134
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.250
<v 1>Are we talking about when we say smooth for something that's not really matter</v>

135
00:06:21.251 --> 00:06:23.350
though, is that we say are smoother than a billiard ball,

136
00:06:23.351 --> 00:06:26.140
but it's this isn't made of matter as we know it is, or.

137
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.480
<v 0>Yeah. Kind of, I mean, it's made of neutrons mostly, at least it's out.</v>

138
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.980
<v 1>What does it, if I know, I know there'll be a lot of problems.</v>

139
00:06:32.981 --> 00:06:36.280
If I went close to a neutron star and tried to touch it, I'm not naive to that,

140
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.350
but if I did touch it, what am I touching? Is it, is that hard? Is it cold?

141
00:06:41.351 --> 00:06:43.570
Is it hot? Like what does it compare to.

142
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.080
<v 0>Just above the surface of the neutron star is its atmosphere,</v>

143
00:06:47.081 --> 00:06:47.920
which again is tiny,

144
00:06:47.921 --> 00:06:51.880
but there are energetic electrons and so on in the immediate vicinity of it.

145
00:06:51.881 --> 00:06:55.510
So you will probably be able to touch those. But I honestly don't know,

146
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.410
is this your answer? Um, but apart from the fact that I wouldn't recommend it,

147
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.510
but beyond that, I really don't know how,

148
00:07:01.511 --> 00:07:04.390
what you would actually feel if you were able to stroke a neutron star.

149
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.350
<v 1>And I put that on my bucket list. I guess.</v>

150
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.620
<v 0>Another thing to say about it,</v>

151
00:07:11.621 --> 00:07:15.760
which is that there was already a constraint on how smooth these things were,

152
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.420
which comes from the fact that if they were somewhat asymmetric and they were

153
00:07:19.421 --> 00:07:22.690
giving out these gravitational waves, but energy has to come from somewhere.

154
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.060
And the answer is, it comes from the spin of the neutron star.

155
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.290
And so what you would expect is that if it were radiating these gravitational

156
00:07:29.291 --> 00:07:32.380
waves away through these kinds of asymmetries, the neutron star should do,

157
00:07:32.381 --> 00:07:34.420
what's known as spinning down. It should slow down,

158
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:39.130
but that comes back to probably two, um, the, the pulse or effect again,

159
00:07:39.131 --> 00:07:41.170
remember I said that if there's a magnetic field,

160
00:07:41.171 --> 00:07:43.840
which is a bit misaligned with the rotation, you'll see these pulses.

161
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.170
One of the other things of having the magnetic field kind of spinning around

162
00:07:47.171 --> 00:07:50.680
like that is that in itself produces electromagnetic waves,

163
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.180
which also carry away energy.

164
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.510
So some of the energy being carried away from a neutron star causing it to spin

165
00:07:55.511 --> 00:07:58.570
down, comes from this, what's called magnetic dipole radiation.

166
00:07:58.571 --> 00:08:00.010
The fact that you've got these spinning magnet,

167
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.110
the most conservative thing you can say is, well,

168
00:08:02.111 --> 00:08:04.390
let's presume pre pretend that that's not there at all.

169
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.290
Maybe if the entire spin down, we're just coming from gravitational waves.

170
00:08:08.291 --> 00:08:10.690
What would that mean for the asymmetry of the neutron star?

171
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.730
And it turns out that already gives you a quite interesting limit on how smooth

172
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:17.110
the neutron star has to be.

173
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.380
What's new about this result is this is the first time they've gone beyond that

174
00:08:20.381 --> 00:08:23.920
limit to actually measure effectively a limit on the gravitational waves

175
00:08:23.921 --> 00:08:26.860
themselves rather than from this indirect effect.

176
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.160
<v 1>Tell you what black holes get all the good publicity and the glamour.</v>

177
00:08:30.161 --> 00:08:31.960
But I think neutron stars are awesome.

178
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.550
<v 0>At least they can do stuff, right?</v>

179
00:08:33.551 --> 00:08:36.340
A black hole is just black and there's not much you can say about it.

180
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.340
Interesting things go on around it. But neutron stars,

181
00:08:39.341 --> 00:08:41.830
you can actually say interesting things about the neutron star itself.

182
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:47.230
<v 2>That's 142 is out here. They found a bump.</v>

183
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.980
They found an increase in the number of, uh,

184
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.260
electron positron pairs coming out.

185
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.220
You have a melting temperature of about 25,000 Kelvin,

186
00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.880
which is kind of your typical temperature of a lightning bolt and the specific

187
00:09:00.881 --> 00:09:02.170
heat capacity of water.
