00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.380
<v 0>So this video allows me to work in one of my favorite words in astronomy,</v>

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.110
which I wanted to put into a video for a long time,

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.940
which is CCG Susan. Isn't that a great word?

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.760
Good for Scrabble sizzle G in astronomy is a co-align

5
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.260
moment, a lining up of three bodies in some sort of gravitational alignment.

6
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.200
So we're used to this all the time. When we have eclipses,

7
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.710
we've got a synergy of the earth and the sun and the moon in different

8
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:31.440
combinations, depending on which kind of eclipse it is.

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.180
And yesterday there was a scissor G in the solicit system because the

10
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:38.280
planet Jupiter was it opposition.

11
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.410
And that means it is directly opposite the sun as seen from

12
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.470
earth. So we're here on earth. The sun is in one direction,

13
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.010
Jupiter's directly opposite, which makes it great for viewing.

14
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.360
And we get a clear view. It's up all night. It's really bright and very nice.

15
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.680
And so this made me think, how do we get from one planet to another,

16
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.630
if Jupiter is an opposition,

17
00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:03.630
which means it's pretty much just close as it's going to get to us,

18
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.710
wouldn't this be the best time to be sending a mission to Jupiter?

19
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.250
And the answer of course is no. Um,

20
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:15.120
and so what we're going to explore in this video today is the challenges of

21
00:01:15.121 --> 00:01:18.870
moving around the solar system when everything else is in motion,

22
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.090
and we've got gravity to contend with.

23
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.450
One of my favorite recent series has been the expanse.

24
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.910
Have you seen the expanse? You would love the expanse.

25
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.710
It's a story that's entirely set in the solar system so that the solar system

26
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:32.491
has been colonized.

27
00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:34.980
The other planet Sydney in the asteroid belt have been colonized,

28
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.990
a real prominent character in the stories is gravity is the

29
00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:43.680
challenges of getting round the solar system and the challenges of growing up

30
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.010
and living in lower gravity environments, what that means.

31
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.030
And particularly the challenges of getting from one place to the other and

32
00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:52.230
everything that that involves.

33
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:54.720
So that's kind of what I wanted to talk about today because you know,

34
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:59.040
all the graphics that we see of the solar system have planets lined up,

35
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.550
you know, in a line, you would see that, obviously not to scale.

36
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.250
<v 1>No, and Australia is upside down, which I like. I can see it right in Australia.</v>

37
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.600
<v 0>Just for you and Annie. And even in science fiction that this happens a lot.</v>

38
00:02:11.601 --> 00:02:12.800
You think, right? You're going to Jupiter.

39
00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:14.600
And then you go a little further and you get to Saturn.

40
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.780
<v 1>There's no Pluto. Pluto is not a planet.</v>

41
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.710
We did a whole video. I'm leaving. Okay.

42
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.750
<v 0>The point is, the planets are not, we all know this,</v>

43
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:30.140
the planets are not arranged in this nice line, just because we get to Jupiter.

44
00:02:30.141 --> 00:02:31.910
Doesn't mean that if we go a little further,

45
00:02:31.911 --> 00:02:36.590
we get to Saturn because these things are actually orbiting in circles around

46
00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:38.720
the sun or ellipses. And, you know,

47
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.630
Jupiter might be over here in one configuration and Saturn might be.

48
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.940
<v 1>Way over here ever been in a perfect line.</v>

49
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.360
<v 0>Um,</v>

50
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.410
I'm sure we could cycle back through the solar system calculator and find lots

51
00:02:48.411 --> 00:02:51.530
of Cisco GS in the solar system.

52
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.770
I don't think it's very likely that everything has been in the line. Um,

53
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.850
but that would be a neat thing.

54
00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.830
<v 1>Maybe that's where they started</v>

55
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.330
really trolling me today. Okay. So this is a view.

56
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.220
<v 0>Of where the solar system planets are today. At least the inner solar system,</v>

57
00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:11.010
starting from Jupiter, Jupiter with its spot there.

58
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.860
And then Mars is over here. And then,

59
00:03:13.861 --> 00:03:16.650
because I said that Jupiter is an opposition.

60
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.630
That means that the earth and the sun and Jupiter in a straight line,

61
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.370
and then further in,

62
00:03:23.371 --> 00:03:27.810
you've got Venus and you've got mercury and the inner planets are zipping around

63
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.690
much faster. The outer planets are moving much more.

64
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.880
<v 1>Slowly. So.</v>

65
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.260
<v 0>Let's imagine now that we just want to get from earth to Jupiter.</v>

66
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.460
So how would we do that?

67
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.510
We wouldn't send out a rocket pointed at Jupiter right now because Jupiter's

68
00:03:42.511 --> 00:03:46.710
moving, Jupiter's moving slowly. The earth is moving a little bit more quickly.

69
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.870
And so what do we do the most efficient way to get from one orbit

70
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.040
to another is something called a homerun transfer orbit.

71
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.930
And this is beautiful and simple because all it needs are two

72
00:04:00.931 --> 00:04:03.540
impulses, two changes of velocity.

73
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.250
And that will get you from earth to orbit eventually to Jupiter's orbit.

74
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.190
It's not the fastest way. It's the most efficient way.

75
00:04:11.191 --> 00:04:13.230
It uses the least amount of fuel,

76
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.280
which is obviously going to be a big consideration when you're traveling around

77
00:04:17.281 --> 00:04:18.150
the solar system,

78
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.830
that might not be the best way to do it in terms of human passengers and

79
00:04:22.831 --> 00:04:26.460
protecting them for radiation, keeping them fed, watered and everything,

80
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.350
but in terms of pure rock.

81
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.580
<v 1>Okay, efficiency.</v>

82
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.230
<v 0>Now I know from past experience that we've got many viewers out there</v>

83
00:04:37.231 --> 00:04:39.990
who are participants in the Kerbal space program,

84
00:04:39.991 --> 00:04:41.700
which is a solar system simulator.

85
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.030
And I know that when I talk about the home and transfer orbits,

86
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.970
the hairs on the back of their neck will be going up and saying, okay, yes,

87
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.810
but there's more complicated orbits. And there's more things to think about.

88
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.730
And that's absolutely true. This, as many things are in,

89
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.030
um, our explanations of physics is simplified.

90
00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:04.200
This is the simplest orbit to assuming that the two bodies are perfectly in the

91
00:05:04.201 --> 00:05:08.430
same plane, it's seeming that they're starting on very circular orbits,

92
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.790
and it's neglecting the gravitational effects from other bodies.

93
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.050
That being said,

94
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.460
this is how you would get from earth to Jupiter using a home and transfer orbit.

95
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.310
All you have to do is at the right point,

96
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.340
you want to launch your spacecraft from earth.

97
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.350
Orbit will neglect getting off the earth.

98
00:05:25.351 --> 00:05:28.890
We'll see more in the same orbit around the sun as the earth is.

99
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.300
And all you want to do is add velocity in a

100
00:05:33.301 --> 00:05:35.280
tangential direction.

101
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.020
So we want to give it an instantaneous boost that way. What is that going to do?

102
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.910
We've known for hundreds of years,

103
00:05:41.911 --> 00:05:46.110
since Kepler came up with his laws that beautifully described the motions of the

104
00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:46.920
planets,

105
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.300
that the planets orbit the sun in elliptical orbits with the sun at one

106
00:05:51.301 --> 00:05:55.710
focus. So if we're starting from a relatively circular orbit here,

107
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.300
and we add that impulse, we make this into bigger ellipse.

108
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.410
If we do it just right, we'll then follow an elliptical path.

109
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:05.390
And if we time it just right,

110
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.430
that elliptical orbit will have its furthest

111
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.100
distance from the sun it's app.

112
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:16.610
Helion right at the intersection with Jupiter's orbit.

113
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.780
So that gets us where we want to go. Now we just have to get the timing, right?

114
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.310
And so what we have to calculate is when to make that maneuver

115
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.470
in order that we catch up with Jupiter and we crossed that

116
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:32.120
orbit, it's not earth that's going.

117
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.810
And we crossed that orbit just as Jupiter gets there.

118
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.380
So that's only half the story though, because if that's all we do,

119
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:44.030
we'll fall back in on this orbit and we'll continue back into this nice

120
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:48.890
elliptical orbit that will cross Earth's orbit at one end and Jupiter's orbit at

121
00:06:48.891 --> 00:06:49.520
the other.

122
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.930
And when space X launched the Tesla Roadster into orbit and said,

123
00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:55.700
it was going to Mars, this is what it did.

124
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.260
It went into an orbit that took it across the orbit of Mars.

125
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.090
But then it's come back again and it's going to be in that Mars earth loop until

126
00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:09.320
something else changes it. Oh, you can track it. I found a website.

127
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.270
So it is on its way back to earth orbit, not to earth, just like it.

128
00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:17.900
Didn't get to Mars because Mars wasn't there. When it crossed Mars orbit,

129
00:07:17.901 --> 00:07:19.400
it's going to come back to Earth's orbit,

130
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.110
but earth is going to be on the other side, right?

131
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.180
<v 2>The sun will one day, will it get to one of them one day? Well,</v>

132
00:07:24.181 --> 00:07:26.950
one of them happened to be there when it will either get back to earth or Mars.

133
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.190
<v 0>Assumably if it lasts long enough and you forward this info, you know,</v>

134
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.970
infinitely, but what's more likely is that it will be broken up or disturbed or,

135
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.240
or something. The chances of it actually hitting either is very, very slim,

136
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.800
right? So we sent her spacecraft on a transfer orbit to Jupiter.

137
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.950
When we get there, if we don't do anything else to the spacecraft,

138
00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:46.720
it's just going to follow this elliptical orbit.

139
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:51.280
We need to change its velocity again so that we match the orbital speed of

140
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.660
Jupiter. And so then you apply one more impulse.

141
00:07:55.661 --> 00:07:59.590
So that's all you need is two impulses. Two changes in velocity.

142
00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.640
One at Earth's orbit,

143
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:04.660
one at Jupiter's orbit tangential to the direction of the planet's travel.

144
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.570
It's called circularizes the orbit. You're going to change from that lip.

145
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.870
Tickle orbit into a nice circular orbit, matching Jupiter.

146
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:13.030
<v 2>What is the impulse? When we get to Jupiter's orbit.</v>

147
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.140
<v 0>When we get to Jupiter,</v>

148
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:18.940
we have to apply another tangential kick in velocity to speed up to

149
00:08:18.941 --> 00:08:21.910
match Jupiter's orbital speed. Now,

150
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.360
if you wanted to get into Jupiter's orbit around Jupiter,

151
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.920
or if you wanted to land on Jupiter, that would require even more, um,

152
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.970
velocity change in terms of rocket trajectories,

153
00:08:33.971 --> 00:08:35.860
we talked about a Delta V budget.

154
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.770
So Delta is the Greek symbol that we use for change.

155
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.520
And Delta V is just the total amount of velocity changes.

156
00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:45.760
You need to make your maneuver happen.

157
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.220
Forget Jupiter for a minute for trying to land on Mars.

158
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.970
Some of that Delta V could be acquired through aerobraking.

159
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.140
If you want to land on a planet,

160
00:08:53.141 --> 00:08:55.860
you need to slow down or you're just going to slam right into it.

161
00:08:55.861 --> 00:08:59.340
So there's some atmosphere on Mars, not very much,

162
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.300
but some of that velocity you can lose by arrow breaking.

163
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.940
This would take 33 months to get from earth to Jupiter by this

164
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:13.380
orbital transfer. And that might not be what you want. So for example,

165
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:18.300
the new horizons spacecraft was sent on a mission to explore Pluto

166
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:23.130
and a transfer orbit to get from Earth's orbit to Pluto would take 46

167
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:24.780
years, which isn't so good.

168
00:09:24.781 --> 00:09:28.080
If you're trying to plan your career and solve scientific problems,

169
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.540
that's a lot of waiting around in actual flag.

170
00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:35.040
New horizons got Pluto in eight and a half years. How did that work? Well,

171
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.360
two things, first of all,

172
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:41.100
it wasn't trying to insert itself into orbit at Pluto's

173
00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.410
distance from the sun or around Pluto.

174
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:48.060
It just wants screaming by really, really fast. And so there,

175
00:09:48.061 --> 00:09:50.520
you don't have to worry about these beautiful ellipses.

176
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:54.480
You just apply as much rocket fuel as you can in the right direction at the

177
00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:58.170
right time and off you go. And so when new horizons launched,

178
00:09:58.171 --> 00:10:02.910
it was the fastest, um, object made by humans launched from the earth.

179
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.320
Okay? So what's screaming away from the earth at about 16 kilometers per second,

180
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.560
and that's enough to escape the solar system.

181
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:15.420
It was helped on the way by passing by Jupiter. So as,

182
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:19.380
as many of the outer system probes have it got a little kick,

183
00:10:19.381 --> 00:10:24.150
it got a gravity boost by flying by Jupiter and by falling towards

184
00:10:24.151 --> 00:10:28.020
Jupiter, it slowed down Jupiter, so many tiny amounts,

185
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:32.490
and some of that momentum was transferred to the spacecraft and sort of flung it

186
00:10:32.491 --> 00:10:34.920
out, even further into the outer solar system.

187
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:38.160
This was used famously by the Voyager two spacecraft.

188
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.090
When the NASA scientists planning the mission realized there was a very

189
00:10:42.091 --> 00:10:43.920
fortuitous alignment of planets,

190
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.580
which meant that they could visit not just Jupiter and Saturn,

191
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:52.290
but then change the trajectory to swing around and see Uranus and

192
00:10:52.291 --> 00:10:52.910
Neptune.

193
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:56.120
<v 2>Wow. It always seems funny to me that this doesn't slow them down.</v>

194
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.970
Surely I would have thought there were ways in which going by something like

195
00:10:58.971 --> 00:11:01.790
Jupiter would slow down hurdling out of the solar system.

196
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.350
<v 0>It all depends on the direction in which you approach it.</v>

197
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:11.420
And so these gravity slingshots can be used to slope spacecraft down

198
00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:13.190
just as they can to speed them up.

199
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.520
And that's in fact how we get to the inner solar system.

200
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:20.480
You can imagine the solar system is this big, well, this gravity well,

201
00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:24.290
and to get out, you have to apply energy and escape. And so you might think,

202
00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:24.561
well,

203
00:11:24.561 --> 00:11:29.060
it must be easy then to just roll down the Hill and drop down into the inner

204
00:11:29.061 --> 00:11:29.930
solar system.

205
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.700
But that neglects the fact that we're traveling really fast

206
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:39.260
in a tangential direction around the sun. That's why we don't fall into the sun.

207
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.390
It's because we're traveling really, really,

208
00:11:41.391 --> 00:11:44.030
really fast in a sideways direction.

209
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.300
That's why when we try to send things into orbit around the earth,

210
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.630
we don't just send things straight up and then they don't come down again.

211
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.000
We send things up, get them through the atmosphere.

212
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.170
Then we send them sideways really, really fast.

213
00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.120
And what happens then is that they're constantly falling towards the earth,

214
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:05.050
but they're falling so fast that they keep missing it continuously and falling

215
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:06.820
round around the other side,

216
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.110
just as we're continuously missing the sun as we fall around the solar system.

217
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.560
And so what do we need to do to get into the inner solar system?

218
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:18.910
We need to slow down some of that sideways motion. So we did the same thing,

219
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:23.890
apply a tangential Delta V to our spacecraft velocity.

220
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.800
But this time we're not trying to add velocity to it.

221
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.780
We're trying to take away velocity.

222
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.680
And when we take away some of that sideways earth motion,

223
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.830
we start to fall towards the inner solar system.

224
00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.950
And this is how we've got spacecraft to Venus, to mercury.

225
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.400
And most recently how we've sent the parkers.

226
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.930
<v 1>Probe once the sun liftoff, Oh,</v>

227
00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:50.100
the mighty Delta for heavy rocket with NASA's Parker, solar probe,

228
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.720
a daring mission to shed light on the mysteries of our closest star. The sun.

229
00:12:55.410 --> 00:13:00.060
<v 0>Is a spacecraft that is designed to get as close as we've ever been</v>

230
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.050
to the sun.

231
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:05.400
It will actually pass within 10 times the radius of the sun.

232
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.340
It'll fly through the solar Corona,

233
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.040
the outer atmosphere of the sun to try to learn about it.

234
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.540
It's an incredible mission.

235
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:16.830
It's not a straightforward maneuver to just cancel out all of this earth,

236
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.500
orbital motion. Again,

237
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.030
they are using this time Venus for a fly by,

238
00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.650
and this time we're going to do exactly what you suggested is come at it from

239
00:13:28.651 --> 00:13:29.910
the other direction,

240
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.140
which will speed Venus up a tiny bit and slow the Parker,

241
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:38.970
solar probe down enough to gradually change its orbit into a

242
00:13:38.971 --> 00:13:40.950
nice tight elliptical orbit.

243
00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:44.910
That's going to send it eventually screaming round the sun at

244
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.410
0.06%.

245
00:13:46.411 --> 00:13:50.400
The speed of light when it reaches its maximum orbital velocity in

246
00:13:50.401 --> 00:13:51.480
2024.

247
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.770
And it's going to take seven flybys of Venus to make that happen.

248
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.100
<v 1>Sounded like current Mars probes get there pretty much.</v>

249
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:04.410
<v 0>This is the way that we are restricted to at the moment until we build much</v>

250
00:14:04.411 --> 00:14:06.000
bigger, um,

251
00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.960
propulsion systems or much more efficient propulsion systems.

252
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.820
We are simply stuck with the fact that doing anything else would

253
00:14:14.821 --> 00:14:17.790
require so much fuel both on the beginning end,

254
00:14:17.791 --> 00:14:21.480
but also at the other end that it's just not practical to do anything but the

255
00:14:21.481 --> 00:14:26.160
most efficient maneuvers. Now there are obviously some subtleties,

256
00:14:26.161 --> 00:14:28.140
there are some extra things that you can do here.

257
00:14:28.141 --> 00:14:32.400
You can do powered Slingshot maneuvers, where you fire your engine,

258
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.220
right at the deepest part of the potential. Well,

259
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:38.760
that's the most efficient place to add the extra impulse,

260
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:43.410
but by and large, we are restricted to these launch windows,

261
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.200
for which everything lines up just right,

262
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.410
so that we can send things in the most efficient manner.

263
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.220
<v 1>Is it going to be this way when we start sending to other stars.</v>

264
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.650
<v 2>As well? Is that how it's going to work? Is it going to be, you know,</v>

265
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.530
where's this star going to be when we launched this thing and that,

266
00:14:57.531 --> 00:15:00.050
or is it there's going to be other ways of doing this by that time.

267
00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.700
<v 0>There may be some really interesting technologies with solar sales,</v>

268
00:15:03.701 --> 00:15:06.670
just catching the solar wind and just very slowly,

269
00:15:06.671 --> 00:15:11.320
but consistently accelerating to a very high velocity and then reversing that

270
00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.300
somehow on the other end.

271
00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:14.231
<v 2>Oh,</v>

272
00:15:14.231 --> 00:15:18.040
where's Andromeda going to be in 10,000 years and something and sending things.

273
00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.160
<v 0>I mean, this is something astronomers have to worry about. Um,</v>

274
00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:25.270
just in terms of finding our way around the sky, everything is moving.

275
00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.900
The stars are apparently moving, um,

276
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:33.130
on time skills that we can measure on timescales that cause problems for us as

277
00:15:33.131 --> 00:15:36.220
astronomers. And so if you're trying to get from one place to another,

278
00:15:36.221 --> 00:15:38.620
depending on what those timescales are, yeah.

279
00:15:38.621 --> 00:15:42.340
You have to take into account that everything is moving relative to everything

280
00:15:42.341 --> 00:15:44.980
else, but that's going to be a long way away.

281
00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.290
<v 2>You were two videos on my objectivity channel. I'd love it.</v>

282
00:15:50.291 --> 00:15:52.540
If you go and have a look at them, they're new ones.

283
00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:55.450
One is about the American Apollo moon rocks.

284
00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:59.890
And this other one is about some grains of sand brought back from the moon by

285
00:15:59.891 --> 00:16:03.100
the Soviets. I'll put links on the screen and in the description,

286
00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:07.210
I think you might enjoy them. 26 grains of sand.

287
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.130
<v 3>You just held a piece of the moon. How cool is that? Indeed, because these 26.</v>

288
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.390
<v 2>Grains of sand are Russian Moondust.</v>

289
00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:21.520
<v 3>So this is Apollo 15 sample 54, one five. It's the Genesis rock.</v>
