1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.230
<v 0>It's going to try and get it working.</v>

2
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.570
It's like Fonzie. That's exactly what I thought.

3
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.140
And there's a reference that will be lost. And most of the audience, Oh,

4
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.110
we've got two stations. Fantastic. So the business end is actually going to be,

5
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.140
all this is doing is amplify and stop at a session down there, each voice.

6
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.070
So this is a London stairs. She was called. Absolutely.

7
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.070
And this is all coming out of a penny,

8
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.660
tiny wire and a penny and a penny is acting as a diode rectifier on the signal.

9
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:50.580
And we are picking up a station called absolute radio all the way from London

10
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.360
on a piece of way, or hung out at my office, which is acting as an antenna.

11
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.160
And actually, if we didn't have this and we had a pair of headphones,

12
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.380
this thing would work with no power source.

13
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.980
<v 1>Well, you're like a high powered physicist. What are you doing?</v>

14
00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:10.790
Messing around with this? So it all goes back about, um,

15
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.200
how many years would it be? 41 years, 41 years to this book,

16
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.200
this book was actually published in 1972.

17
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.070
And this is where for me, physics started my uncle.

18
00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:23.720
Benny was a radio amateur,

19
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.680
really interested in shortwave radio and listening to shortwave radio and

20
00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:31.370
building antennas, getting better signals. He and I, when I was about 10,

21
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.270
use this book to build something which is called a crystal radio.

22
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.990
So we've got a coil, which is an inductor. We've got a capacitor,

23
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.110
which we can choose. So we can change the capacitance, a diode,

24
00:01:42.111 --> 00:01:43.550
which is something called a rectifier,

25
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.390
which means it only lets current flow one way and a pair of headphones.

26
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.931
Or indeed,

27
00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:51.650
I used an ear piece exactly like this it's what's called a Pietro electric or a

28
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.280
crystally or piece. Is this the actual book or this is,

29
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.250
this is I really wish I had the actual book. I suspect if I had the actual book,

30
00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.960
it wouldn't quite be in this good or quality.

31
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:03.320
There's a whole new series of Ladybird books by the way that some of you

32
00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:05.150
might've seen, which are pretty good.

33
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.460
The zombie apocalypse mindfulness and best of

34
00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:14.480
all, the student Lisa finds her revision timetable. Very tiring.

35
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.180
That is because it starts at 1:00 AM when she can be sure,

36
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:19.490
dear time television has definitely finished.

37
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.220
There were a spoof of these books that are, I learned a lot.

38
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.060
There was this one and this one and a whole host of other ones that basically

39
00:02:26.061 --> 00:02:30.860
you use a plank of wood and we weren't even as technical as putting

40
00:02:30.861 --> 00:02:33.230
screws in it, what you use instead,

41
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.530
what I would call thumbtacks or drawing pins.

42
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.880
And we just press those into the board and we wedge their component leads

43
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.140
underneath. So here we have our coil coil here, capacitor,

44
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.040
which is this thing.

45
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.220
I went down to our over-friendly electronics workshop and said,

46
00:02:49.221 --> 00:02:52.100
I'd like an old style van capacitor because I want to recreate this.

47
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.960
And they went, Hey, you go fell.

48
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.220
And then I haunted through a few of these to find one with the good capacitance

49
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.390
on one that was actually working what they used to do. And for example,

50
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:04.270
these were also known, known as crystal radios,

51
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.990
but they were also known as foxhole radios and prisoners of war used to build

52
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:09.370
them in the, in the second world war.

53
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.650
And they couldn't get their hands on something like this.

54
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:15.220
So what the other thing you can do instead of changing the capacitance and

55
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:16.480
having a capacitance variable,

56
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.990
you can change the inductance and the way you do that is you have different what

57
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.460
are called taps on the coil.

58
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.830
So instead of connecting the diode right at the end,

59
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:26.230
you might connect it here or here or here or here.

60
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:28.930
And that allows you to change the frequency that you're detecting.

61
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.870
So when I initially built this all those years ago,

62
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:35.650
we used something which is called a Silicon diode important thing with this is

63
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:37.630
it only allows current to flow one way.

64
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.670
And so instead of it's sloshing back and forth like this,

65
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:42.340
it's just allowing it to flow in one direction as really,

66
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:46.090
really important in terms of being able to detect the signal and to pull out the

67
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:50.680
signal, to extract the signal, um, the music, the sound,

68
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.600
the voice from what's called the carrier rave, which is a radio wave itself.

69
00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.220
The radio wave itself is a combination of what's called a carrier wave,

70
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.640
which is very high-frequency maybe a million times going back and forth,

71
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:04.510
maybe a million times,

72
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:08.500
a second electric field flipping back and forth at a megahertz.

73
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.180
And of course they, audio signal is much, much lower than that.

74
00:04:13.181 --> 00:04:14.740
It's a tens of kilohertz.

75
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.850
And so this along with the other elements and the circuit pulls out the audio,

76
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:23.080
the music, the talk, whatever, from, from the overall radio wave.

77
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.970
<v 2>Phil, when you're a boy, you said that you used, you used one of them.</v>

78
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.313
What have you done today?

79
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.490
<v 1>What I've done today? This is amazing. I can't believe this actually works.</v>

80
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.650
So with a penny in the UK,

81
00:04:34.651 --> 00:04:38.880
at least it's different in the U S don't my Wiki homework on this in the UK,

82
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.950
where you have a stainless steel and it's colder to copper,

83
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.700
but of course that copper oxidizes, and this is a fairly badly oxidized.

84
00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:47.100
You can see even little patches of green stuff on this. Penny,

85
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.113
if you look carefully.

86
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.160
And the wonderful thing is just like Silicon copper oxide is something called a

87
00:04:53.161 --> 00:04:56.850
semiconductor. And so with this type of diode,

88
00:04:56.851 --> 00:05:00.600
what happens is you get two different types of, of Silicon one, which is doped,

89
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.170
what's called N-type and another, which is called dub pay type.

90
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.200
The doping changes the conductivity and you sandwich those together.

91
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.570
And when those two materials interact and mix to a certain extent,

92
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.830
what happens is that you get a barrier for electrons to flow in one direction

93
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.250
and not a barrier in the other direction. Now wonderfully,

94
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.210
you can also do the same thing with a metal on semiconductor contact.

95
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.130
And it's called a Schottky diode.

96
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.400
This is about the most rudimentary form of a shocky diode.

97
00:05:29.401 --> 00:05:33.960
One can imagine its called a cat's whisker in that we've got a wire touching

98
00:05:33.961 --> 00:05:36.310
very, very gently because we want to touch the oxide.

99
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.990
We don't want to dig through to hit the copper or the steel underneath because

100
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:43.140
then we'd short over the note. So we want to have a weak contact.

101
00:05:43.141 --> 00:05:46.170
So we've got this thing in this wire on it's acting almost like a spring.

102
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.050
So it's so delicate, right? It's gone completely now.

103
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.820
So we've got to try and recover it. This might involve quite a lot of swearing.

104
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.100
<v 2>Nope. And it goes.</v>

105
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.960
<v 1>Again. And so this is what they used to do.</v>

106
00:05:59.961 --> 00:06:02.720
Can you imagine being in the sort of trenches and your prisoner of war,

107
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.450
just moving this thing around or so frustrated,

108
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:06.800
you want to have some sort of icon.

109
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:10.670
<v 0>What's happening.</v>

110
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.560
<v 1>Hit the table. So this contact here is moving ever of ever so slightly.</v>

111
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.060
And so what I want to do is just jog it.

112
00:06:16.061 --> 00:06:18.850
So it finds a nice spot on the penny where we've got a good.

113
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.720
<v 0>Come on you pig</v>

114
00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:29.170
[inaudible].

115
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.770
<v 1>Okay. So that's not great. So it depends on where you are in the penny.</v>

116
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:38.230
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

117
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.340
<v 1>Not bad. This is on a penny on a penny. When I first did this,</v>

118
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.090
I think I got more excited than when I did it as a 10 year old.

119
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.930
Obviously those are recent Nobel prize. And I was just reading this blog,

120
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.090
which is in the dark by a guy called Peter colds.

121
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.660
But he's talking about the Princeton press conference for Jim peoples.

122
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.650
I'm sure you've done something on Jim Peebles recently Bridie and there's this

123
00:06:59.651 --> 00:07:03.670
wonderful quote from peoples. My advice is not to him.

124
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.940
My advice is not to employ prizes and awards.

125
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.050
They will come or they want don't judge your career by the number by the counter

126
00:07:11.051 --> 00:07:14.680
prices. We're in this for the joy of research, the fascination,

127
00:07:14.681 --> 00:07:18.520
the love of science. That is the reward really. And honestly,

128
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.470
when this thing worked last night,

129
00:07:20.471 --> 00:07:24.070
when I tried it for the first time I was jumping around the room. Um,

130
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.730
and I'm no quite a bit older than I was when I first made it.

131
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.450
But still there was still the same punching the air moment. Phil,

132
00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:34.480
we've done videos before about your real research.

133
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.320
And one thing we always talk about is that tip of your microscope and how

134
00:07:38.321 --> 00:07:42.250
sensitive it is, it reminds me exactly, but even better than up ready,

135
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.360
even better. Oh thank you for that wonderful unplanned segue.

136
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.680
This is one of the Silicon samples from or STM.

137
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.620
This is a sample one. And while both are two samples there,

138
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.990
both of which we've imaged with atomic resolution.

139
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.740
And what I'm going to do is take this and let's see if we can use one of these

140
00:07:59.741 --> 00:08:02.740
Silicon samples. It should be easier than a penny, um,

141
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:06.970
to actually detect the signal because we've got a semiconductor and we've got a

142
00:08:06.971 --> 00:08:08.560
metal, so, okay. We'll take that out.

143
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.070
I probably will never get it working again. Piece of Silicon.

144
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:16.600
This is going to replace the penny. So I just have to adjust

145
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:22.870
When enough pressure. So it sits under there, but not so much that it cracks.

146
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.210
Just bear with me. This is all as fiddly.

147
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:40.210
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

148
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.500
<v 1>That's what we'd expect. It's suddenly conductor than a Trumpy owned penny.</v>

149
00:08:44.501 --> 00:08:47.200
So we should expect a better signal. Physics works,

150
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.180
sort of tuning a circuit. There's a signal. How's it gone?

151
00:08:52.181 --> 00:08:56.310
I think there's another one back here. Notice no attention.

152
00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.280
<v 0>Pant to screening. This is about as Heath Robinson as a guts.</v>

153
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.380
So that's our signal. That's our ground.

154
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:02.670
And I've just a couple of them together.

155
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:07.110
I wanted it to be as close as possible to what happened years ago.

156
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:11.663
Yeah.

157
00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.103
<v 3>Okay.</v>

158
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.620
<v 0>Come on right here. Place a song.</v>

159
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:30.703
Ready?

160
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.000
Thank you. Absolute radio for being on exactly the right frequency of course,

161
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.250
because what you can do is you can work.

162
00:09:40.251 --> 00:09:43.910
I want frequency of detecting from the inductance here and the capacitance here,

163
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.760
but um, I wish I planned it that much.

164
00:09:46.761 --> 00:09:49.490
You can see from the really higgledy-piggledy wire.

165
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.850
And I didn't put a lot of effort into this and it worked.

166
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.880
It's a rock radio as well. It was very helpful.

167
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.833
[inaudible].

168
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:43.070
<v 3>We didn't stop here. You can hear even more from Phil,</v>

169
00:10:43.071 --> 00:10:45.350
particularly on the topic of resonant frequency.

170
00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.900
<v 0>Notice I'm not driving at the amplitude stairs to same.</v>

171
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:49.550
All I'm changing is the frequency.

172
00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:50.540
<v 3>Really important.</v>

173
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.860
There were links on screen and in the video description and to see more videos,

174
00:10:54.861 --> 00:10:58.310
including plenty more from Phil, check out everything on our channel,

175
00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.320
60 symbols, or.

176
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.110
<v 0>We can do what we're doing here and we can listen to it.</v>
