00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.410
<v 0>So here's my little Evie scope set up on the patio.</v>

2
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.950
<v 1>You've got this lifelong love of astronomy.</v>

3
00:00:06.951 --> 00:00:09.680
I imagined you'd had many telescopes over the years.

4
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:10.850
You're going to set me straight here.

5
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.330
<v 0>I have. So no I've never owned a telescope. When I was a kid,</v>

6
00:00:14.331 --> 00:00:17.570
my dad had a really nasty little cheap telescope that we messed around with for

7
00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:18.404
a bit.

8
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.280
And I've got an old nautical telescope that just sort of lies around the place,

9
00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:26.240
but I've never owned a serious look at the sky kind of telescope.

10
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.540
<v 1>Why is that? Why is that? Why have you never had one?</v>

11
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.900
<v 0>Um, partly because,</v>

12
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.810
so the times I've actually tried to set up telescopes myself.

13
00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:39.410
It turns out I'm pretty hopeless at it. You know, if you go to an observatory,

14
00:00:39.411 --> 00:00:40.430
there's a nice big telescope,

15
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.430
which somebody really competent a set up and controls and runs for you.

16
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.210
If it comes to trying to line up your own telescope and getting all the bits of

17
00:00:47.211 --> 00:00:50.210
kit to work, that's not really something I'm particularly good at. Um,

18
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.900
so it it's never really appealed all that much until now.

19
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.210
<v 1>What is the skill you lack or like,</v>

20
00:00:56.211 --> 00:00:59.090
what's the thing about you that made you not good at setting one up?

21
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.270
<v 0>It is a strange thing. So years ago, uh,</v>

22
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.540
I used to run field trips with undergraduates out to the Canary islands,

23
00:01:05.541 --> 00:01:07.490
where there was a telescope that we used out there,

24
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.250
which is very basic telescope. And it was very interesting.

25
00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:11.510
You could see amongst the students,

26
00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:15.350
some of them just had this magic touch that they could just line the telescope

27
00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:17.390
up pointing roughly where they wanted it to be.

28
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.460
And there would be the object they wanted to look at.

29
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.200
Whereas other people could be, you know,

30
00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:25.280
really technically competent and try really hard and never get a decent image

31
00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:27.740
out of it. And unfortunately I'm in the latter category.

32
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.100
<v 1>All right. It's just like a, it's just like a knack. Is it like a magic touch?</v>

33
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.270
<v 0>It does. It, it is. Yeah. It really is a bit of a touch to it. Um,</v>

34
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.550
and it's just not something I'm particularly good at.

35
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.050
<v 1>Why has this changed professor? Why did you take the plunge because of the,</v>

36
00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:44.600
sort of the lockdown situation or no.

37
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.930
<v 0>It was a complete coincidence. So actually a couple of years ago,</v>

38
00:01:47.931 --> 00:01:51.920
I back to Kickstarter, which is something I'd never done before. Um, but, uh,

39
00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:54.560
there was this Kickstarter for basically someone was saying we're going to

40
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:56.330
produce a completely idiot proof telescope.

41
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.240
And so I figured that was just the thing for me. Um,

42
00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:02.750
so I backed it really early and then it sort of disappeared for a while.

43
00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:05.180
And I didn't actually think all that much more about it until I got a

44
00:02:05.181 --> 00:02:06.290
notification saying, you know,

45
00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:09.770
your telescopes being shipped and conveniently it arrived. Just,

46
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.560
this is a lockdown was beginning. So right at the beginning of a lockdown,

47
00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:13.880
I got a nice telescope to play with.

48
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.640
<v 1>So now you've been doing some lockdown astronomy.</v>

49
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.210
<v 0>I have. Yeah, not exactly from the ideal site in that it's sort of,</v>

50
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.550
I can't go any further than my own back garden at the moment,

51
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.880
but I can take the telescope out there and stick it in the back garden and

52
00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:28.880
pointed up at the sky, um, and start doing some astronomy.

53
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.010
The only slight snag I have here in my back garden is that the patches of

54
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:38.810
sky I can choose are somewhat limited because there are a lot of trees

55
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.540
and my wife wouldn't let me chop them down.

56
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.660
<v 1>I know you've got a lot of trees around your house and you live in Nottingham,</v>

57
00:02:44.661 --> 00:02:46.730
which is, you know, a big city with lots of light,

58
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.440
but you can still get the job done Kenya.

59
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.290
<v 0>Pretty much. Yeah, it is amazing. I mean this whole,</v>

60
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.200
the whole point of this telescope is that it's actually designed to be used in

61
00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:55.034
any environment.

62
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.550
And so actually what it does is it takes a whole series of really short

63
00:02:58.551 --> 00:03:00.040
exposures, just keeps adding them up.

64
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.910
And some of the tests data that they did was, you know,

65
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:08.350
in really brightly lit places where you really couldn't see much of the sky at

66
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:10.840
all. And the amazing thing is if you just keep adding the data, you know,

67
00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:13.000
the light from the stars and the galaxies is still there.

68
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.570
And eventually you can dig it out from the noise of all the city lights.

69
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:18.610
They actually did some tests in Las Vegas, for example,

70
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:21.790
which is not famous for its lack of lighting. Uh, and they were able to see,

71
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:25.480
you know, deep, deep sky objects from a parking lot in the middle of Las Vegas.

72
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.060
<v 1>Now you're going to take us through some of your images that you've imaged from</v>

73
00:03:30.061 --> 00:03:32.460
your backyard in Nottingham, which I'm very excited about.

74
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.790
The obvious first one to look at is so-called first light.

75
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.480
Can you explain the term first light for people who aren't astronomers and what,

76
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.680
what that emotes.

77
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.790
<v 0>It's, it's the man that magic moment and, you know, in my case, well,</v>

78
00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:46.560
actually I had a fair while to wait for this telescope,

79
00:03:46.561 --> 00:03:49.740
but it is that magic moment where you've spent years and years building a

80
00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:52.830
telescope will be in building an instrument and you finally get to point it at

81
00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:55.830
the sky and see if it actually works. And so the first light image,

82
00:03:55.831 --> 00:03:59.280
usually you pick something sort of reasonably dull and straightforward and

83
00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:00.030
fairly bright,

84
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.730
just because you don't want to stress things too much at the outset.

85
00:04:02.731 --> 00:04:06.300
And you want to find out what the problems might be with your setup. Um,

86
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.500
but yeah, that first light image,

87
00:04:07.501 --> 00:04:11.220
when you first point the telescope at the sky and take a picture and hope you

88
00:04:11.221 --> 00:04:12.930
hit something. And in this case I did.

89
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.350
<v 1>What if, what, what did you choose for first light and why?</v>

90
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.420
<v 0>Okay, so messier 34,</v>

91
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.740
very ordinary open cluster about a little over a thousand light years away,

92
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.660
a hundred million years old. So it's not a particularly exciting object. Um,

93
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.550
partly I wanted to pick it because it stars.

94
00:04:29.551 --> 00:04:31.860
And actually one of the things you want to check with the telescope when you

95
00:04:31.861 --> 00:04:33.540
first set it up is whether it's focused on art.

96
00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:37.260
So you want to see how sharp point like the individual, uh, stars are.

97
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.951
And it really,

98
00:04:37.951 --> 00:04:40.770
I picked it because actually this telescope is sufficiently smart.

99
00:04:40.771 --> 00:04:43.200
That if you just say what's a good object to look at at the moment,

100
00:04:43.201 --> 00:04:47.040
it'll tell you, um, and [inaudible] was what the telescope picked for me.

101
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.560
<v 1>Okay. And you're happy with the picture.</v>

102
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.170
It looks pretty good for a first first attempt. If you asked me.

103
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.290
<v 0>It's pretty good. Yeah. It's a pretty sharp image. It's you know,</v>

104
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.670
it wasn't quite in focus.

105
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.250
I've since figured out how to better how to focus the telescope,

106
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.980
but it's a nice, nice picture. You know, lots of stars there,

107
00:05:01.981 --> 00:05:05.340
definitely a fluster and proves that it is amazing. Like this telescope,

108
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.010
you just basically, you take it out, you plunk it down on the ground.

109
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.310
The only thing you have to do is make sure it's level. But beyond that,

110
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.650
it basically figures everything out. So it,

111
00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:16.680
it uses your phone to tell it where you are in the world.

112
00:05:16.681 --> 00:05:19.470
So it knows roughly and what the time is. So it knows all that stuff,

113
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.580
but then you just pointed it in some random direction. It takes a picture.

114
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.400
It figures out from the pattern of stars as it sees,

115
00:05:26.401 --> 00:05:27.750
what direction it was pointed in.

116
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.120
And at that point it will take you anywhere else in the sky.

117
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.090
And so part of this was just testing. Does that really work?

118
00:05:33.091 --> 00:05:36.930
And it turns out it does you say go to MSCI eight 30, four and 10 seconds later.

119
00:05:36.931 --> 00:05:37.764
There it is.

120
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.130
<v 1>Is that taking away some of the pleasure or the skill to you,</v>

121
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.030
like what's left to do, what's your role? Now.

122
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.200
<v 0>I get to pick what I want to look at. As I said, it's the, you know,</v>

123
00:05:49.201 --> 00:05:52.590
the stuff that I'm really not very good at is that setting telescopes up,

124
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.690
making sure everything's aligned with everything else,

125
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.430
finding things in the sky, all that stuff has gone away now.

126
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:00.830
And I just get the pleasure of looking at things in the sky.

127
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.350
<v 1>What have we got next? We've got comet C two Oh one nine one.</v>

128
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.970
<v 0>This was just something that was sort of timely in that it was a comment that</v>

129
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.700
there was an announcement that there was, this comment had come along.

130
00:06:12.701 --> 00:06:14.560
That potentially might be quite bright.

131
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.040
Subsequently it's actually turned out to be a bit of a bust in that it's fallen

132
00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:21.670
to bits. So it's actually fragmented four apart. There was some hope.

133
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.130
This might be one of those bright comments you can see with the naked eye.

134
00:06:24.131 --> 00:06:25.870
It's now not going to be. Um,

135
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.790
but there was quite a lot of interest in it at the time.

136
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.340
And it's an interesting target to go after because of course,

137
00:06:30.341 --> 00:06:32.740
comments move relative to all the stars.

138
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.920
And so you actually have to find its current coordinates.

139
00:06:35.921 --> 00:06:38.620
And instead of telling the telescope to go to a particular object,

140
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.750
you actually have to tell it which coordinates to go to.

141
00:06:40.751 --> 00:06:43.570
So it was a good check to make sure that the telescope could actually pick up

142
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.720
things just on the basis of coordinates. And sure enough, there, it was one,

143
00:06:46.721 --> 00:06:49.330
the telescope swung around to the coordinates that it had at the time.

144
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.500
<v 1>That's pretty good. Any idea how far away that was at the time you mentioned it?</v>

145
00:06:53.501 --> 00:06:56.680
Like, are we talking like I didn't, I didn't even know where to start,

146
00:06:56.681 --> 00:06:57.514
how close.

147
00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.310
<v 0>It's coming into the inner solar system at the moment.</v>

148
00:07:00.311 --> 00:07:04.060
So it'll be a matter of a few astronomical units. I would guess.

149
00:07:04.061 --> 00:07:04.894
I honestly don't know.

150
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.150
It's all a bit was going to take it pretty close to the sun,

151
00:07:07.151 --> 00:07:08.590
but I don't think it come that far yet.

152
00:07:08.591 --> 00:07:10.210
So I think it sort of broke up on its way in.

153
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.300
<v 1>If I can find out where it was on the night you imaged her,</v>

154
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.120
I'll put a little thing on the screen for people at home in retrospect.

155
00:07:16.121 --> 00:07:19.570
So they'll get no idea next on your list here. We have a

156
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.710
[inaudible], which I can, I can just make out in the image.

157
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.491
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

158
00:07:24.491 --> 00:07:27.460
You might need to do a little bit of work on those images to actually get things

159
00:07:27.461 --> 00:07:30.880
to a point where you can see them on the video. I guess it is pretty faint. Um,

160
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.140
so it's M 97.

161
00:07:32.141 --> 00:07:35.470
Is this thing called the owl Nebula so-called cause I think maybe it was Hershel

162
00:07:35.471 --> 00:07:38.080
was the first to observe it and found and drew this sketch of it,

163
00:07:38.081 --> 00:07:40.210
which he sketched as a little owl for some reason,

164
00:07:40.211 --> 00:07:44.650
but you can see quite why it's sort of it's this greenish circle with two dark

165
00:07:44.651 --> 00:07:49.150
dots or two dark holes in it. Uh, it's a planetary Nebula.

166
00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:52.270
So it's one of these late stages of a star, a bit like the sun,

167
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.530
which is in the process of blowing itself to bits.

168
00:07:54.531 --> 00:07:56.290
So it's blown off all this outer layer.

169
00:07:56.291 --> 00:07:59.110
So the big sort of round fuzzy thing or the outer layers of the star that had

170
00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:02.590
been blown out already, uh, there's a white dwarf star in the middle.

171
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.890
You can maybe see the little bright dots of the white dwarf in the middle.

172
00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:10.480
And then the two dark holes are actually where the star is now instead of just

173
00:08:10.481 --> 00:08:11.770
blowing everything out symmetrically,

174
00:08:11.771 --> 00:08:14.260
it's actually blowing things out along the poles of the star.

175
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:18.280
So it's evacuated to cavities. So those holes are actually, uh,

176
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.970
where it sort of tumbled through the material that it had previously objected

177
00:08:21.971 --> 00:08:24.160
out. So it's quite a lot of structure going on there.

178
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:29.230
The green coloring blue-green coloring is partly down to scattered light from

179
00:08:29.231 --> 00:08:33.550
the white dwarf, which is very hot in the middle, partly down to emission from,

180
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.830
uh, ionized oxygen cause INI.

181
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.400
So it's very hot and ionized oxygen produces this sort of characteristic green

182
00:08:39.401 --> 00:08:43.300
shade. And then maybe you can see in the very outer parts, it turns red,

183
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.850
there's a sort of faint red ring around the outside.

184
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.230
That's where it's a bit cooler.

185
00:08:47.231 --> 00:08:49.330
And you're seeing that characteristic red emission,

186
00:08:49.331 --> 00:08:50.560
which comes from hydrogen gas.

187
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.370
<v 1>Oh seven 97. There's also an excellent deep sky video. People can watch.</v>

188
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.100
Absolutely. As are quite a few.

189
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:56.911
<v 0>Of the things we're going to talk about.</v>

190
00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:59.850
I think the sun will become a planetary Nebula.

191
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.110
This could be how the sun could like in 5 billion years, time.

192
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.450
<v 1>53 And NGC five Oh five, three.</v>

193
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.630
<v 0>Yes. Two for the price of one, two globular clusters,</v>

194
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.550
actually very close to each other on the sky.

195
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.980
And actually both are very similar distances away.

196
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.230
They're two of the more distant ones in the Milky way,

197
00:09:18.231 --> 00:09:21.620
but they're actually at similar distances and in a similar direction, in fact,

198
00:09:21.621 --> 00:09:22.670
they're sufficiently close together.

199
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.650
They were even interacting with each other a little bit.

200
00:09:24.651 --> 00:09:28.010
So there's some tidal interaction between the two that's been detected. Um,

201
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.200
so they really are sort of twins in that sense.

202
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.040
But the interesting thing about them is I've probably in one or two of my more

203
00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:36.320
careless moments said when you've seen one globular cluster,

204
00:09:36.321 --> 00:09:37.730
you've seen them all. Um,

205
00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:40.580
the interesting thing about these two is they're about as different as you get

206
00:09:40.581 --> 00:09:42.380
as globular clusters go. So, I mean,

207
00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:45.080
one of them is impressively big and bright and the other is pretty pathetic.

208
00:09:45.081 --> 00:09:48.650
Really. There are five times as many stars in the brighter one. Um,

209
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.680
but actually it looks a lot more impressive than even that factor of five

210
00:09:51.681 --> 00:09:53.420
because it's very centrally concentrated.

211
00:09:53.421 --> 00:09:56.750
So you get this real brightness in the middle. Um, whereas this,

212
00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:00.590
the second one is it is a lot fainter, but it's also much more diffuse,

213
00:10:00.591 --> 00:10:01.430
much more spread out.

214
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.790
And so it does show that actually even things where globe globular clusters,

215
00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:08.630
where everyone sort of thinks they're more all more or less the same,

216
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.610
they really can be very different from each other.

217
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.550
<v 1>Oh, you say they're very close on the sky, but you've,</v>

218
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.610
you've used two different images to image them. They're not so close.

219
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.600
They will appear in one image.

220
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.120
<v 0>No, I think there were about a degree or so apart,</v>

221
00:10:20.121 --> 00:10:21.950
a couple of degrees apart on the field of you,

222
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:25.700
of the telescopes only about half a degree. So you had to move the telescope,

223
00:10:25.701 --> 00:10:26.690
but not really, not very far.

224
00:10:26.691 --> 00:10:28.550
They really are right next to each other in the sky.

225
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.600
<v 1>Just looking at the dates, you imaged these on the same day as well. Yeah.</v>

226
00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.440
<v 0>Yeah. So once I'd done one, it was no trouble at all to go to the other one.</v>

227
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:37.940
They were right next to each other. And I think,

228
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.860
I think the exposure times are the same as well.

229
00:10:39.861 --> 00:10:42.230
So it really is kind of a fair comparison between them.

230
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:47.450
<v 1>Next. We have M 51, this is a, this is a real, a showboat galaxy. This one.</v>

231
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:50.540
<v 0>Okay. Yeah. And 51. Yeah. Everyone's favorite galaxy.</v>

232
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.590
It's probably was one of the early things that I looked at just because it's

233
00:10:54.591 --> 00:10:59.060
such a pushy galaxy it's Gloria spiral structure, the Whirlpool galaxy,

234
00:10:59.061 --> 00:11:01.910
as it's otherwise known, being stirred by its companion.

235
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:05.390
So that little companion that sort of tightly stirring things around absolutely

236
00:11:05.391 --> 00:11:06.620
beautiful galaxy to look at.

237
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.290
And I was really pleased when I was able to get a decent picture of it.

238
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.130
<v 1>To the naked eye. Is it even a V is anything visible?</v>

239
00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:16.550
It's not even a speck as a, it's just, this is nothing to the naked eye.

240
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:21.170
<v 0>I think it's too faint. Yeah. I think the only galaxy largest galaxy,</v>

241
00:11:21.171 --> 00:11:24.770
a decent distance away you can see with the naked eye is the Andromeda galaxy M

242
00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:27.920
31. Um, so this one you really need to telescope to see.

243
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:29.120
<v 1>That's not a bad image,</v>

244
00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:32.750
that one that's starting to get up around kind of what I would, you know,

245
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.430
semiprofessional quality until you compare it to a proper professional M 51.

246
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.640
<v 0>That's the thing. I mean, you know, I'm, I'm really pleased with these pictures,</v>

247
00:11:40.641 --> 00:11:44.750
but actually the people who do this stuff properly and, you know, do the,

248
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:49.070
so the telescope I'm using has a little color detector in it. So actually it's,

249
00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.530
you know, you get your, your whole color picture all in one, go,

250
00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.680
the people who do the job more properly,

251
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:57.250
take pictures through different colored filters and then combine them and do use

252
00:11:57.251 --> 00:12:00.910
all sorts of fancy software to really extract the maximum from their data.

253
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:03.280
I'm doing the easy thing of just having the telescope,

254
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.190
bring it all together for me and make a quick color picture. But yeah,

255
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:07.024
I'm pretty chuffed with them.

256
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.680
<v 1>It's funny, isn't it. Even though you've done as little as almost,</v>

257
00:12:10.681 --> 00:12:14.640
you could possibly humanly have done to claim to made the image,

258
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.980
you didn't even align the telescope. Uh,

259
00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.600
there's something about knowing it's yours.

260
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:23.760
<v 0>It really is. It is bizarre. Yes. And you know, all credit to the technology.</v>

261
00:12:23.761 --> 00:12:26.250
It did most of the hard work, but I'm still claiming it as mine.

262
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.600
<v 1>All right. M 63, we've got another galaxy.</v>

263
00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:35.250
<v 0>I image this one just because it's of a nice contrast to M 51 in that it is</v>

264
00:12:35.251 --> 00:12:38.010
another spiral galaxy. It's really rather a pretty spiral galaxy,

265
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.430
but completely different in character in the [inaudible] is one of these things

266
00:12:41.431 --> 00:12:45.690
called a grand design spiral. Uh, N 63 a is a,

267
00:12:45.691 --> 00:12:48.450
what's known as a flocculant spiral galaxy. So cool.

268
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.390
Because it looks sort of wooly, it looks like little Tufts of wool.

269
00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.810
It's clearly sort of completely different in appearance 251.

270
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.990
And so there's been an interesting point of contention in astronomy as to what,

271
00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:01.290
what it is that causes different types of spiral structure.

272
00:13:01.291 --> 00:13:05.010
And it seems likely that this sort of flocculent spiral structure probably has a

273
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:09.510
rather different origin from the grand design that we saw in messier 51.

274
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:14.790
<v 1>Okay. How have we done M 63 on deep sky videos? Yes. It was our most recent one.</v>

275
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.060
<v 0>Yeah. And in fact, you've put this image in it, this images in your video.</v>

276
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.490
<v 1>So yes, I was just looking,</v>

277
00:13:20.491 --> 00:13:22.800
I was looking at the website saying it's not there and that's because we've done

278
00:13:22.801 --> 00:13:24.780
it so recently I haven't put it on the website yet.

279
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.580
<v 0>So, and in fact, part of the,</v>

280
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.610
part of the reason I took the picture was because I knew you were making a video

281
00:13:29.611 --> 00:13:31.320
and I thought I might be able to sneak it into the video,

282
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.440
the sunflower galaxy sunflower galaxy.

283
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.410
Cause it looks like those little fine pedals you find in a sunflower yeah.

284
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.740
<v 1>NGC 42 44. So this isn't in the messier catalog,</v>

285
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:45.270
but it's in the new general catalog.

286
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:46.470
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

287
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.220
And you can see it's not as big and impressive and bright as the things in the

288
00:13:50.221 --> 00:13:51.090
messier catalog,

289
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.000
which is why it didn't make it into the messier catalog because they really had

290
00:13:54.001 --> 00:13:56.970
to be things that you could find relatively easily, um,

291
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.090
or other messier or one of his collaborators could find relatively easily.

292
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.540
But actually part of the reason why it's not so big and bright is because it's

293
00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:07.170
exactly Adrian, it's a beautiful disc Aloxi that we're looking at sideways on.

294
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.920
And so it doesn't look as impressive because you only get that sort of sideways,

295
00:14:10.921 --> 00:14:11.820
thin view of it.

296
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:16.680
But at some level it is in a very impressive thing to look at because it shows

297
00:14:16.681 --> 00:14:19.080
quite how thin spiral galaxies really are,

298
00:14:19.081 --> 00:14:23.020
how when you do get to see the major on, they really are dislike. Um,

299
00:14:23.021 --> 00:14:24.150
so this is a sort of a,

300
00:14:24.151 --> 00:14:27.330
some of the first evidence that the was that as to what the three-dimensional

301
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.210
structure of galaxies really was that the fact that you occasionally saw them

302
00:14:30.211 --> 00:14:33.990
this thin meant that they had to be really intrinsically very thin discs of

303
00:14:33.991 --> 00:14:35.060
stars. Next.

304
00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:39.550
<v 1>We have, I see three, four to what's. I see, I don't know that one.</v>

305
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:43.530
<v 0>So I see is the index catalog. There's the messier catalog.</v>

306
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:47.310
Then there was the new general catalog came along with a much bigger catalog of

307
00:14:47.311 --> 00:14:50.400
star clusters, Nebula and galaxies. Um,

308
00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.690
and then as a sort of supplement to the new general catalog,

309
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.930
the NGC was this thing called the IC, the index catalog,

310
00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:00.770
which essentially sort of hoovered up a lot of objects that hadn't been found

311
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.740
for the NGC. They tend to be smaller and fainter,

312
00:15:03.741 --> 00:15:05.600
which is why they weren't in the NGC.

313
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.580
And a lot of them were actually only fire found when photography started coming

314
00:15:10.581 --> 00:15:11.930
into astronomy and people could actually,

315
00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:14.260
instead of having to observe just with the eye to an IP,

316
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.790
could actually take pictures and see things that have been too faint to see

317
00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:19.970
before. And so this particular galaxy, for example,

318
00:15:19.971 --> 00:15:24.290
wasn't found until the 1890s, um, which is surprising because it's actually,

319
00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:27.530
it's a big galaxy is a big bright galaxy intrinsically.

320
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.480
It's almost the same size as the full moon.

321
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:33.920
So it would be a big galaxy on the sky, but it's very, very fine.

322
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.820
And the reason it's very fine is because it's very close to the plane of the

323
00:15:37.821 --> 00:15:38.241
Milky way.

324
00:15:38.241 --> 00:15:42.350
It's only about 10 degrees out of the plane of the Milky way and the Milky way

325
00:15:42.351 --> 00:15:45.290
contains all this city stuff that absorbs light.

326
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.010
So that w we're sort of viewing it through all this obscuration,

327
00:15:49.011 --> 00:15:50.510
that's associated with the dust,

328
00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:53.240
the city material in the plane of the Milky way.

329
00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.810
And so only about a quarter of its light actually gets through,

330
00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.680
we lose three quarters of the light from it, which is why it looks so pathetic.

331
00:16:00.681 --> 00:16:04.100
And ghost-like in those images is also why there's so many stars in the images

332
00:16:04.101 --> 00:16:05.870
because we're very close to the plane of the Milky way.

333
00:16:05.871 --> 00:16:08.390
So we're starting to pick up more and more of the Milky way stars.

334
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:13.070
And so the reason why it ends up looking so sort of pathetically faint is

335
00:16:13.071 --> 00:16:16.370
because we're viewing it through all this fog of the interstellar dust within

336
00:16:16.371 --> 00:16:20.120
the Milky way, which is sort of making it lose most of the light.

337
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:23.240
And so we only see this sort of wrecked like appearance of a galaxy.

338
00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.590
<v 1>I think, I mean, my impression, my initial impression, which of course,</v>

339
00:16:26.591 --> 00:16:29.500
you know, after thinking for a few seconds, I realized was ridiculous,

340
00:16:29.501 --> 00:16:33.820
but because it's so faint and because there were so many stars and it almost

341
00:16:33.821 --> 00:16:35.950
creates this illusion that we're seeing through it,

342
00:16:35.951 --> 00:16:37.810
and we're seeing stars on the other side of it.

343
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:42.160
But of course all the stars you see that are individual stars are well and truly

344
00:16:42.161 --> 00:16:42.994
in the foreground.

345
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.470
<v 0>Very definitely. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

346
00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.860
And actually part of the interesting thing is that we're not really seeing

347
00:16:47.861 --> 00:16:50.110
through things at all, right. The reason why things appear,

348
00:16:50.111 --> 00:16:52.840
so find is we're not seeing through the Milky way. And so,

349
00:16:52.841 --> 00:16:55.000
although we tend to think of galaxies as transparent,

350
00:16:55.001 --> 00:16:56.440
that you can see things behind them.

351
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.080
This is telling us that that's not quite the whole story.

352
00:16:59.081 --> 00:17:01.750
That actually there is quite a lot of obscuration and the galaxy,

353
00:17:01.751 --> 00:17:03.490
which prevents you from seeing things behind them.

354
00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:07.600
<v 1>We're almost lucky the earth is as far flung as it is.</v>

355
00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.200
<v 0>The good news is that the dust in the Milky way is in a pretty thin plane,</v>

356
00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:15.940
which means that the number of directions where we ended up looking through a

357
00:17:15.941 --> 00:17:19.450
lot of it is, is not very many, right? Cause most directions you could look in,

358
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.220
you're kind of looking out through it.

359
00:17:21.221 --> 00:17:22.450
And so you're not looking through much of it.

360
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:25.720
You have to be pretty unlucky to be looking right in the plane of the galaxy.

361
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:28.720
So, so it doesn't mean there were lots of directions we could look in,

362
00:17:28.721 --> 00:17:31.960
but there are some places where you really can't see very much just because the

363
00:17:31.961 --> 00:17:33.760
obscuration is that, that intense.

364
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:39.580
<v 1>That obscuring dust that is sits along the plane of the Milky</v>

365
00:17:39.581 --> 00:17:44.350
way. How far out does it reach from the center? Like, are we in it?

366
00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:48.040
Are we sitting in that dust or does it get more diffuse out as you get further

367
00:17:48.041 --> 00:17:50.100
out into the disk? So it does.

368
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.840
<v 0>Get more diffused. There is still some there,</v>

369
00:17:51.841 --> 00:17:54.750
basically wherever there are stars, you end up with dust because of the star,

370
00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.040
the dust comes from star.

371
00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:59.610
Some of the late stages of stellar burning are kind of not,

372
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.020
they're not smokeless effectively.

373
00:18:01.021 --> 00:18:03.150
So they just put out lots of this sorting material.

374
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:06.300
And so actually wherever there are stars, you'll end up finding dust.

375
00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.080
<v 1>So stars are big polluters for all this talk about how clean solar energy is.</v>

376
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:13.370
<v 0>They really are well, most of their lives they're pretty well behaved.</v>

377
00:18:13.371 --> 00:18:13.941
But as I say,

378
00:18:13.941 --> 00:18:17.300
in some of those later stages where they're sort of throwing off a lot of their

379
00:18:17.301 --> 00:18:19.340
outer layers of gas and cooling down a lot,

380
00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:22.550
that's where you tend to get dust grains forming. So in those late stages,

381
00:18:22.551 --> 00:18:24.920
you end up throwing a lot of dust out into the galaxy.

382
00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:30.050
<v 1>Okay, next we have NGC four, four, four, nine.</v>

383
00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.440
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, this is no particular favorite galaxy.</v>

384
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:36.230
I took a picture of it cause it's one that I happened to have written a paper

385
00:18:36.231 --> 00:18:39.020
about all. He's been one of the authors on a paper about this galaxy.

386
00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:42.500
It's a splotchy looking galaxy thing called an irregular galaxy.

387
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:46.130
It's a pushy close cousin to the large Magellanic cloud.

388
00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.070
So those from the Southern hemisphere,

389
00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.230
very familiar with the large Magellanic cloud is one of the galaxies you can see

390
00:18:51.231 --> 00:18:54.710
with the naked eye is pretty similar to it in that like the large Magellanic

391
00:18:54.711 --> 00:18:57.740
cloud, it has a bar like structure in it. It's a disc Aloxi,

392
00:18:57.741 --> 00:19:00.590
but it's very messy. It's not as tidy as the spiral galaxies.

393
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.740
It's quite a bit further away. So it's quite a lot harder to see,

394
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.220
but the interesting difference between it and the large Magellanic cloud is it

395
00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.710
that this galaxy is producing an awful lot of stars.

396
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.270
It's almost a Starburst galaxy.

397
00:19:11.271 --> 00:19:15.050
It's producing an intense burst of stars right now, or at least in the,

398
00:19:15.051 --> 00:19:16.700
in the recent past. Um,

399
00:19:16.701 --> 00:19:20.060
one of the unanswered questions until a couple of years ago was why,

400
00:19:20.061 --> 00:19:24.860
why is this galaxy producing stars so vigorously and what we were able to do

401
00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.830
by taking a really deep image? So this was, uh,

402
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.500
an 18 hour exposure with a half meter telescope.

403
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.220
So still by astronomical standards of relatively small telescope half,

404
00:19:34.221 --> 00:19:36.140
we did telescope as a smallish telescope.

405
00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:39.080
But by looking at this patch of sky for 18 hours,

406
00:19:39.081 --> 00:19:43.190
we've got a very deep image and we're able to see that this galaxy actually has

407
00:19:43.191 --> 00:19:45.080
a companion that it's ripped to pieces.

408
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.530
So it's clearly had a close encounter with an even smaller galaxy.

409
00:19:48.531 --> 00:19:50.150
This is quite a small galaxies to start with,

410
00:19:50.151 --> 00:19:52.580
but it's had a close encounter with an even smaller galaxy.

411
00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:57.440
And the net effect of that is it ended up ripping the other galaxy to pieces,

412
00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:01.280
but also triggering a big burst of star formation in this galaxy.

413
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:03.740
<v 1>What was it like imaging this one,</v>

414
00:20:03.741 --> 00:20:07.010
like for old time's sake and because of a personal connection and seeing this

415
00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.110
splodge like all the other ones, but,

416
00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.840
but having all this extra knowledge about it,

417
00:20:11.841 --> 00:20:15.830
and now this like this relationship that you form under the fire of writing a

418
00:20:15.831 --> 00:20:16.664
paper about it.

419
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:18.170
<v 0>So that was really nice,</v>

420
00:20:18.171 --> 00:20:21.410
but actually the other interesting thing and the sort of the warm glow I got

421
00:20:21.411 --> 00:20:24.230
from looking at this one is most of the other galaxies I've looked at are very

422
00:20:24.231 --> 00:20:26.900
sort of they're the standard galaxies that everyone looks at. Right?

423
00:20:26.901 --> 00:20:30.350
And so actually there were lots and lots of images of them at some level,

424
00:20:30.351 --> 00:20:33.560
my images don't really stack up to the beautiful ones that some people end up

425
00:20:33.561 --> 00:20:36.080
making. And I don't feel like I'm doing anything. You know,

426
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:37.880
lots of people have trodden that path before.

427
00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:40.730
The nice thing about these galaxies is not that many people bother to look at

428
00:20:40.731 --> 00:20:43.640
it. And so it's nice to look at a galaxy, which is, you know, is,

429
00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.640
is one of those in one of those little nooks and crannies that most people don't

430
00:20:46.641 --> 00:20:50.500
bother to in astronomy Fairlight, you've got off the beaten track a bit. Yeah,

431
00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.150
absolutely. And as you said,

432
00:20:52.151 --> 00:20:54.370
it's kind of nice to look at a galaxy where I think I, you know,

433
00:20:54.371 --> 00:20:56.140
I know something interesting about this galaxy.

434
00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.860
And so do you do feel that sort of connection to it as well? Yeah. Last year.

435
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.770
<v 1>But not least Virgo cluster M 87 and NGC four</v>

436
00:21:04.771 --> 00:21:05.790
double five zero.

437
00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:06.960
<v 0>So yeah,</v>

438
00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:11.190
so our nearest sort of brightest cluster of galaxies is one which I can just

439
00:21:11.191 --> 00:21:12.900
about get to through a gap in the trees.

440
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:16.830
So I had to go at looking at it and it's big enough on the sky that you don't

441
00:21:16.831 --> 00:21:18.000
get to see the whole cluster at once,

442
00:21:18.001 --> 00:21:20.130
but you can start picking out some of the galaxies from it.

443
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:25.500
And so one of the really famous galaxies in this cluster is MSCI 80, 87 and 87.

444
00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.980
It's sort of right near the middle of the cluster is a big, bright galaxy.

445
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:32.070
What it's most famous for at the moment is that it's where that image,

446
00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.520
the first image of a black hole came from the black hole telescope,

447
00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:38.250
took an image of it. And actually you can just about,

448
00:21:38.251 --> 00:21:41.820
see one of the consequences of that black hole in this image is quite hard to

449
00:21:41.821 --> 00:21:45.630
pick out. Um, but if you look at about sort of two o'clock in that image,

450
00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:48.720
there's a sort of little bit of an extension in the light.

451
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.920
It's not quite round and what you're picking out there is a hint of the jet.

452
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:56.190
So there's a Jetta material being flung out from that black hole,

453
00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:00.330
the immediate vicinity of that black hole and in a very well collimated way.

454
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:03.900
And so M 87 famously has his jet. It's actually quite hard to see.

455
00:22:03.901 --> 00:22:06.540
So I was really pleased when even with this little four and a half inch

456
00:22:06.541 --> 00:22:07.374
telescope,

457
00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:10.350
you could actually start seeing some hints of the jet coming out of the middle

458
00:22:10.351 --> 00:22:11.160
of med seven.

459
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:11.521
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

460
00:22:11.521 --> 00:22:14.520
It's almost like that's an eyeball and that's where like the front of the eye is

461
00:22:14.521 --> 00:22:15.354
or something. Yeah.

462
00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:17.250
<v 0>It just looks that little bit distorted. Doesn't it?</v>

463
00:22:17.251 --> 00:22:20.430
You can just see that it's not quite round there's something going on in that

464
00:22:20.431 --> 00:22:20.941
direction.

465
00:22:20.941 --> 00:22:24.000
And that really is just a hint of that Jetta material getting flung out.

466
00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:28.320
<v 1>And NGC four double five, zero is also there. You included that.</v>

467
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.560
<v 0>That's another one that I hadn't to have a little bit of a personal connection</v>

468
00:22:31.561 --> 00:22:33.420
to it doesn't look like a particularly exciting galaxy.

469
00:22:33.421 --> 00:22:36.090
It's one of these as zero galaxy. So it's a disc Aloxi,

470
00:22:36.091 --> 00:22:38.520
but without much by way of spiral structure or anything,

471
00:22:38.521 --> 00:22:43.500
it's pretty much edge on what it's famous for is that in the 1990s, Vera Rubin,

472
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:46.020
uh, took a look at it, studied the lights,

473
00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:49.770
split the light from this galaxy up into spectra and found by studying the

474
00:22:49.771 --> 00:22:52.920
Doppler shifts in the light from that spectra that this galaxy is a bit strange

475
00:22:52.921 --> 00:22:55.800
in that it's not rotating either clockwise or anti-clockwise,

476
00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:59.280
it's actually got half the stars going around one way and half the stars going

477
00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:03.370
around the other way. So it's a real oddity somehow this galaxy formed with,

478
00:23:03.371 --> 00:23:07.170
with the stars going around in this sort of two directions at the same time.

479
00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.260
And there were lots of ideas and theories about how it might've formed than

480
00:23:10.261 --> 00:23:11.280
there were some people were saying, well,

481
00:23:11.281 --> 00:23:15.600
maybe the two discs form simultaneously. And they do look pretty much identical,

482
00:23:15.601 --> 00:23:18.840
certainly from the analysis that Vera Rubin and her collaborators did.

483
00:23:18.841 --> 00:23:20.970
They said that they look pretty much the same as each other.

484
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:25.830
The N the bit that we were able to add is that a few years ago with rather

485
00:23:25.831 --> 00:23:28.530
better data, 10, 15 years later, that we could get,

486
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:32.460
we were able to show that actually by studying the light in great detail,

487
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:36.630
the two sets of stars are not the same one is quite a bit younger than the

488
00:23:36.631 --> 00:23:40.440
other. So actually what happened is one this form rotating one way,

489
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.650
then the whole load of gas fell in rotating the other way and formed another

490
00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.100
disc of stars going around the other way. So this.

491
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.490
<v 1>Uh, this period of backyard astronomy you've been doing, uh,</v>

492
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.670
do you think it's been good for you? Like, has it, has it, has it,

493
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:56.810
has it like changed the way you think in any way as a professional astronomer?

494
00:23:56.811 --> 00:23:59.060
Or is it just something you did or like, what are you,

495
00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:00.080
what are you taking from it.

496
00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.960
<v 0>I'm enjoying it fundamentally. No,</v>

497
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:04.240
and it's hard enough at the moment to find things to enjoy, right?

498
00:24:04.241 --> 00:24:07.450
So it's actually nice to have something new to try out, play around with,

499
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:11.740
to enjoy doing so I've enjoyed taking the pictures and thinking about them a bit

500
00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.300
and talking about them and, you know,

501
00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:15.550
I'd be putting them out on Twitter and chatting about them.

502
00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.880
So it's an opportunity for better outreach in astronomy. And it's just,

503
00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:21.580
you know, at some level it is nice to actually, you know,

504
00:24:21.581 --> 00:24:24.750
instead of just looking at the pretty pictures that the Hubble space telescope

505
00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:25.510
taken, you know,

506
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:28.480
it's nice to look at your own pictures and then net New York and that as good as

507
00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:29.770
they were supposed to tell us those pictures,

508
00:24:29.771 --> 00:24:32.260
but that's okay because I made them. And it's just,

509
00:24:32.261 --> 00:24:35.710
you do get a definite sense of satisfaction. Just making the pictures, yourself.

510
00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.700
<v 1>Good sales, Mike. I want one of those telescopes now I bought,</v>

511
00:24:39.701 --> 00:24:43.720
I bought a manual one a few years ago and I never saw a single thing through it.

512
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:45.670
Cause I just couldn't line it up. I'll get it to work.

513
00:24:45.671 --> 00:24:48.700
And I just put it in storage after a few frustrated nights. So.

514
00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.340
<v 0>That, that's why I've never bought a telescope like that.</v>

515
00:24:51.341 --> 00:24:53.350
I know I would have done exactly the same thing. Right.

516
00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.990
<v 1>All right. Well, thanks for your time. My pleasure.</v>

517
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.750
I look forward to more pictures. I look forward to taking them.

518
00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.790
I'll follow you on Twitter to make sure I see them all.

519
00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:06.640
<v 2>Mike, the sun. Can you see your video picture or not?</v>

520
00:25:06.641 --> 00:25:10.720
Because the sun's coming to a point where it's half on your face and half night

521
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.440
you got a towel. Sorry, a towel. All right.

522
00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:17.883
We can do.

523
00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.193
Yeah,

524
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:31.183
yeah.

525
00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.320
<v 0>Yeah. If it doesn't fall down on your head, halfway through the recording. Yeah.</v>

526
00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:38.350
I don't think the sun's going to get into a position, which makes it bad again.

527
00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:41.050
<v 2>It's a nice soft light now. Very well done.</v>

528
00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:45.100
<v 0>Okay. So let me just set myself up roughly where I was before.</v>

529
00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:50.530
<v 2>This is lockdown a YouTube and people. Yeah, absolutely.</v>
