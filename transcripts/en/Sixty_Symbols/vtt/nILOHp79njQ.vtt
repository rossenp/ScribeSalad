00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.470
<v 0>For quite a long time,</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.000
the sort of adopted agreed definition for the edge of space has been something

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:07.410
called the Karman line,

4
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.610
which is located at a hundred kilometers above the earth surface.

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.600
It was not a legal definition, but it's a definition.

6
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.530
And that's been adopted by the federal seal. Internet's now Aaron Nautique,

7
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.730
which is the world air sports Federation, but it's,

8
00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:25.100
it's a largely unsatisfying definition. Um,

9
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.600
because of course the atmosphere doesn't have an edge. It's a continuous,

10
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.090
um, fluid body.

11
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.030
It has lots of different properties and lots of different regions,

12
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:38.510
but none of them have rigidly defined edges. And in fact,

13
00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:43.100
the properties change the function of time and solar activity and lots of other

14
00:00:43.101 --> 00:00:46.400
things, a hundred seems almost too perfect, doesn't it? It does.

15
00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:50.720
So recently a paper has been published called the edge of space

16
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.370
revisiting the Karman line.

17
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.330
And this was work done by an astrophysicist named Jonathan McDowell at the

18
00:00:56.331 --> 00:00:58.730
Harvard Smithsonian center for astrophysics.

19
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.170
And he takes a closer look into whether there is a real scientific

20
00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:05.420
definition for the Karman line.

21
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.430
The original Carmen line definition was roughly associated with

22
00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:15.080
the idea that there's a boundary between where aeronautical forces stop

23
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.410
and you no longer get lift from the atmosphere.

24
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.870
Aeronautical lift is a mechanical force.

25
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.050
It's generated by contact with the fluid, the fluid,

26
00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:27.350
obviously being the atmosphere. And if you run out of fluid,

27
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.530
you run out of force. And so the Karman line is you're,

28
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:35.120
you're sort of wearing our aircraft would have to travel at a speed that's

29
00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:39.830
greater than the orbital velocity in order to get enough lift from wings to stay

30
00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:41.810
in the air. So in this paper,

31
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.760
we looked at the orbits of 43,000 satellites have been tracked over the years.

32
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.820
Yeah. And of course, most of them are way above the Karman line,

33
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.710
but the word substantial numbers that throughout their orbits would pass below

34
00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:56.000
the hundred kilometer line,

35
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.230
getting even closer to 80 kilometers and not just on their last orbit before

36
00:02:00.231 --> 00:02:03.230
they disintegrated, but they have multiple passages this low.

37
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.150
And so right away you can say, okay,

38
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.030
well the a hundred kilometer line doesn't make a lot of sense.

39
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:09.650
You can't have a satellite in orbit.

40
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.380
And then it comes in and out for a little bit. It's not in space and now,

41
00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:15.590
and then it goes back in space and on and on and on. And so right,

42
00:02:15.591 --> 00:02:19.550
there is some evidence to at least support the idea of revisiting this

43
00:02:19.551 --> 00:02:20.330
definition.

44
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.890
So the second thing he did was actually use an atmospheric model and actually

45
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:28.850
make the calculations of, for a typical satellite,

46
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.940
where would the drag forces, um,

47
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.480
be enough to sort of cause it to fall back turf?

48
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.080
So like the death zone for settling the deaths, that's exactly it.

49
00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:43.820
So the conclusion he makes is that for a typical kind of space

50
00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:44.600
vehicle,

51
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.410
the gravity will exceed the aerodynamic forces for any object in steady flight

52
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.660
to the altitude.

53
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.800
The altitude lies in about the 70 to 90 kilometer range.

54
00:02:54.801 --> 00:02:58.830
So we factors in the time variation and all of this stuff and,

55
00:02:58.831 --> 00:03:01.450
and finds a range for this limit,

56
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.190
but notes that it's always well below that a hundred kilometer line.

57
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.450
This is just one argument.

58
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.140
Other arguments would look at the structure of the atmosphere,

59
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:16.060
which is quite complicated, but again, it's divided into specific layers.

60
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.640
Um, mostly based on where the gradient in temperature changes,

61
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.570
these are called pauses. And so at about 85 kilometers,

62
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.220
we've got the Misa pause,

63
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.570
which is the boundary between the Mesosphere and the thermosphere.

64
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.040
And that marks the point,

65
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.090
which is the coldest point in the atmosphere below that point.

66
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.400
The chemical pump position of the atmosphere is mostly steady and above that

67
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:45.280
you've got different molecules moving in different ways.

68
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.260
And so from atmospheric physics,

69
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:50.770
there's also a boundary more towards the 80 kilometer line.

70
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.510
So what's really interesting about this argument is to actually appreciate

71
00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.100
how close space is because the kilometers a hundred kilometers.

72
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.690
That's not that far away, you can easily drive that in an hour. Um,

73
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.950
so I thought it might be fun to look on a map and actually appreciate, um,

74
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.400
to scale how, how, how far away spaces.

75
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.280
Of course our map is centered on the center of the universe,

76
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:16.420
which is here in Nottingham.

77
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.130
And the unit that we're going to use to Mark scale on this map

78
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.530
is the humble Lego block.

79
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.450
The height of this brick is 3.2 millimeters. And so I've printed this map,

80
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:33.220
so that five of these Lego bricks represent a hundred kilometers on

81
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:36.940
this map to put some things into scale. First, let's talk about airline.

82
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.040
So when we're on a commercial airliner,

83
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.240
we're traveling at about an altitude of 10 to 12 kilometers.

84
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.160
So when we're traveling on a commercial airline,

85
00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:49.330
we're not even traveling at the height of this brick above this map.

86
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.100
So the next scale I'm going to show you is the world record for how high a human

87
00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:58.030
being has jumped out of a balloon to skydive down to earth.

88
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.800
So this record was broken recently by Alan Eustace and he

89
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:05.260
jumped from a height of 41 kilometers.

90
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.020
So that would wreck represent two bricks on this map.

91
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.960
And so now we want to go up to the Karman line.

92
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.850
And so the debate we're discussing today is whether we define the edge of

93
00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:17.920
space at 80 kilometers,

94
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.270
which is here or a hundred kilometers, which is here,

95
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.990
doesn't seem that high anyway does it.

96
00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.930
So I think that's the amazing thing to appreciate.

97
00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:30.940
So this height is a hundred kilometers.

98
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.510
What's really amazing is how small this number actually is,

99
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.230
how close we are to space. So I tip this on this, the edge,

100
00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:40.270
and I've got a hundred kilometer marker here.

101
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.380
You can see that Nottingham is closer to space than it is to London.

102
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.320
And I can get to London in an hour and a half on the train. All right.

103
00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:50.080
So maybe nodding to London doesn't mean very much to you,

104
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.430
but if you're in New York, you're closer to space than you are to Philadelphia.

105
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.270
If you're in Los Angeles, you're closer to space than you are to San Diego. Oh,

106
00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.420
let.

107
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.253
<v 1>Me do a Canadian one.</v>

108
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.580
<v 0>If you're in Montreal, you're closer to space than you are to Ottawa.</v>

109
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.970
<v 1>I've got no idea where those places are. All right, cool.</v>

110
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.360
<v 0>Adelaide for you, but nothing's in your house. So.</v>

111
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.940
<v 1>Didn't work. When do you become an astronaut?</v>

112
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.640
<v 0>NASA gives its astronaut wings to anyone who's</v>

113
00:06:21.641 --> 00:06:26.290
trained and flown a successful mission that reaches above 50

114
00:06:26.291 --> 00:06:30.010
miles, which is 80 kilometers. So that's actually the lower limit.

115
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.930
And there's a similar acknowledgement from the U S FAA for civilians

116
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.600
who have piloted a successful flight. Okay.

117
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.460
<v 1>Is this important? Like,</v>

118
00:06:39.461 --> 00:06:43.180
is this just a bunch of people writing papers or does it matter where space

119
00:06:43.181 --> 00:06:44.170
starts and finishes?

120
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.550
<v 0>So it, it,</v>

121
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.480
it matters from a scientific perspective because scientists like to study these

122
00:06:49.481 --> 00:06:50.141
sorts of things.

123
00:06:50.141 --> 00:06:54.100
So it's perfectly understandable that people who are interested in atmospheric

124
00:06:54.101 --> 00:06:58.000
physics and the orbits of satellites would care, but it,

125
00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:02.710
it actually does have some wider issues that now touch on issues

126
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.000
of economics and politics and defense and things like that.

127
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.250
So I mentioned there is no international agreed legal definition of

128
00:07:12.251 --> 00:07:16.570
space. There have been for some time moves to make a legal definition,

129
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.980
but that's always been opposed by the U S and you can understand why,

130
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.800
because from a military point of view,

131
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:28.330
a government wouldn't want to be restricted by international space treaties.

132
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:33.010
When it's trying to launch child's tude, ballistic missiles,

133
00:07:33.011 --> 00:07:33.850
something like that.

134
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.380
<v 1>And what about space tourism?</v>

135
00:07:35.381 --> 00:07:38.050
I guess they want it to be as low as possible so they can sell their space

136
00:07:38.051 --> 00:07:38.884
flights.

137
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:43.570
<v 0>The other issue. So commercial space tourism is becoming a thing. Now,</v>

138
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.590
as we film this Virgin galactic has just managed to this highlight a vehicle to

139
00:07:47.591 --> 00:07:52.300
82 kilometers by the NASA definition that counts as entering space

140
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.500
by the FAI definition. It doesn't cause they haven't reached the Karman line,

141
00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:57.820
but it would matter very,

142
00:07:57.821 --> 00:08:02.620
very much to a commercial enterprise to be able to say that they can

143
00:08:02.621 --> 00:08:06.190
take people into space. Now, practically speaking, you know,

144
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.910
I think what you would want from a space mission is the experience of

145
00:08:09.911 --> 00:08:13.540
weightlessness and the experience of looking out the window and seeing the earth

146
00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:14.650
as a, as a ball,

147
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:18.310
you would get that from 80 kilometers as well as you would from a hundred

148
00:08:18.311 --> 00:08:19.144
kilometers.

149
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.720
<v 1>But like, I look at that and I look at how low that is and I imagined God,</v>

150
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.270
how come you can see the curvature of the earth from such a,

151
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.800
that doesn't seem that high.

152
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:31.270
<v 0>I think partly that's because I've printed a map out on a flat piece of paper.</v>

153
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.680
So in reality, this is a curved surface that I'm showing you here.

154
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.810
You might not see it as a complete bowl,

155
00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:40.540
but you would definitely see the curvature of the earth.

156
00:08:40.541 --> 00:08:42.670
You would experience the earth as a sphere.

157
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:47.140
It becomes quite clear that for commercial enterprise,

158
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.520
you're not going to want to waste money and fuel and an increased risk by taking

159
00:08:51.521 --> 00:08:53.020
people up to a hundred kilometers,

160
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.820
if they can get the same experience going to 80 kilometers. Um,

161
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.670
but part of that experience for people we'll be able,

162
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.020
we'll be being able to say, I have officially been to space.

163
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.470
Where would you be drawing the line? Well, I'm pretty convinced by this paper.

164
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:07.801
I mean,

165
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:11.190
it has some pretty sound arguments from a number of different directions.

166
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:15.540
So I think if there was a move to redefine the 80 kilometer line as the

167
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.360
McDowell line, I think that should go down very well.

168
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.850
<v 1>But the McDowell says 70 to 90. That's like super vague. Wow.</v>

169
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.220
<v 0>That's just because scientists, you know,</v>

170
00:09:25.221 --> 00:09:29.300
scientists you've talked to enough of us over the years and we like our aerobars

171
00:09:29.301 --> 00:09:31.700
and we like our confidence intervals.

172
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.340
But if you want to define a line,

173
00:09:34.341 --> 00:09:37.970
you might as well put it in the middle of a region that is well bounded.

174
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:42.020
This paper has revisited the numbers and the back of the envelope calculations

175
00:09:42.021 --> 00:09:44.900
that gave a hundred, um, are now refined.

176
00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.450
And they might not give a more precise number,

177
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.660
but they at least show us that it's not a hundred.

178
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.800
And so it's very unsatisfying to keep it at that level.

179
00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:59.720
I thought it would be fun to actually build up a perspective on the outs to the

180
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.680
other objects in space gets part of this was motivated by the fact that just

181
00:10:03.681 --> 00:10:05.540
last week I went outside, I suppose,

182
00:10:05.541 --> 00:10:09.050
coming home from work and happened to see the international space station go

183
00:10:09.051 --> 00:10:12.980
overhead. It was really bright. It was a beautiful passage. And as always,

184
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.770
I'm struck by looking up and thinking, Oh my God,

185
00:10:15.771 --> 00:10:18.920
there's human beings flying above my head in orbit around the earth.

186
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.550
That's pretty amazing. How far away are they actually up there?

187
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.310
The space shuttle now no longer in existence,

188
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.320
but I couldn't resist getting my Lego out, uh,

189
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:32.060
used to take astronauts up to the international space station like may Jamison

190
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.870
and that's at 400 kilometers above the surface of the earth.

191
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.650
So in our Lego bricks, if this is a hundred,

192
00:10:39.651 --> 00:10:43.940
we'd need four times that amount. So, uh,

193
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.750
let's do this 13, 14,

194
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:53.720
16. I feel like I'm on Lego masters 20. Excellent.

195
00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:59.060
All right. So this is the orbit at which human beings continuously

196
00:10:59.061 --> 00:11:02.540
inhabit a space station, orbiting the earth.

197
00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.360
And even that is not that high.

198
00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.290
<v 1>I'm slightly less impressed that wasn't your goal.</v>

199
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.250
<v 0>I think one of the values of human space flight,</v>

200
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.490
one of the real values is cultural, not scientific,

201
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:21.860
and it's putting human beings high enough to give them that perspective on

202
00:11:21.861 --> 00:11:25.460
space. And if they only have to go that high,

203
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:30.680
to be able to look out in one direction and see nothing but the infinity of

204
00:11:30.681 --> 00:11:34.880
space and then turn around and look down and see the earth

205
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:40.070
in enough scope to see not borders and not

206
00:11:40.071 --> 00:11:41.840
resources to be exploited,

207
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:46.550
but to appreciate that this is the one and only place where life in the universe

208
00:11:46.551 --> 00:11:51.140
exists and to look out to the horizon and appreciate how

209
00:11:51.141 --> 00:11:55.450
razor thin that atmosphere that keeps us safe is

210
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.890
then I think,

211
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.040
I think it's quite amazing that you don't have to get that high up to find a

212
00:12:00.041 --> 00:12:04.450
perspective where you realize just how carious and how

213
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.320
delicate the ecosystem and the geo system on earth is

214
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.670
what else you want to show you? You got humble there. Okay.

215
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:16.390
So I've got a Nancy Roman and the Hubble space telescope.

216
00:12:16.391 --> 00:12:21.100
One of my favorites and this orbits at an altitude of

217
00:12:21.101 --> 00:12:25.810
540 kilometers, it used to be higher, but it's slowly, even at the altitude,

218
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:29.620
it suffers from cumulative atmospheric drag over time.

219
00:12:29.621 --> 00:12:30.730
So it's going lower and lower.

220
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:35.230
And that represents pretty much the highest altitude that the space shuttle

221
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.880
could reach because it was Hubble was designed to be put into earth orbit

222
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:44.290
at an altitude where the space shuttle could repeatedly go and service it.

223
00:12:44.291 --> 00:12:45.880
And it's a good thing. It did, uh,

224
00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.730
because we benefited from those services emissions quite a lot.

225
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:54.100
And so I've got 20 bricks now and I need to put eight more to get up

226
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.490
to the height of the Hubble space telescope. So one,

227
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:04.480
two, three, five.

228
00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.650
Now we run out of thin bricks.

229
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:13.120
So we're going to put three more on top. And so that's how,

230
00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:16.150
how high the Hubble space telescope is. All right.

231
00:13:16.151 --> 00:13:19.870
So there's the Hubble space telescope. Yeah, there you go. Success.

232
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:23.620
Not to scale, of course, the whole space telescope is about the size of the bus,

233
00:13:23.621 --> 00:13:26.230
not about the width of the United Kingdom. Well,

234
00:13:26.231 --> 00:13:28.840
there's lots of satellites up there in orbits GPS,

235
00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:33.280
global positioning satellites orbit at an altitude of 20,000

236
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:37.840
kilometers above the surface of the earth that would require a thousand Lego

237
00:13:37.841 --> 00:13:40.810
bricks. And I'm not going to build that today. Um,

238
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.580
but I would just note that that would take us 3.2 meters above this

239
00:13:45.581 --> 00:13:49.570
map. Okay. So right through the ceiling. Okay.

240
00:13:49.571 --> 00:13:52.180
And these are satellites they're in geosynchronous orbit.

241
00:13:52.181 --> 00:13:54.310
So they orbit the earth twice a day,

242
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:56.470
but there are satellites that are even further up.

243
00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.240
They're called geostationary orbit.

244
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.670
Their orbital period is matched with the rotation of the earth.

245
00:14:00.671 --> 00:14:02.410
So they orbit once a day,

246
00:14:02.411 --> 00:14:07.060
which means that they are effectively always above the same location,

247
00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:08.440
um, above the equator.

248
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.510
And these are the satellites that give us our weather readings and our

249
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:18.820
active, our communications relies on this scale. You need 1,789 bricks,

250
00:14:18.821 --> 00:14:22.360
which would take you 5.7 meters above the table.

251
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:27.360
<v 1>Oh, that's way up, way up. We're looking here down at the UK and Europe,</v>

252
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.600
how many bricks down is the other side of the earth?

253
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:35.130
<v 0>So I said that the GPS satellites are at a thousand bricks above the earth.</v>

254
00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.030
Um, but the other side of the earth would only be 640 bricks.

255
00:14:39.031 --> 00:14:42.030
So that's less than the height of the GPS satellites.

256
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:44.910
If I want it to go to the moon, of course you want to go to the moon? Well,

257
00:14:44.911 --> 00:14:49.650
you would need to travel 19,220 Lego bricks

258
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:52.850
away, which on the scale would be 60 meters.

259
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:57.560
So there's been enough recent attention to this idea that the Karman line needs

260
00:14:57.561 --> 00:14:58.640
to be redefined.

261
00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:03.020
That the organizations that deal with aeronautical things and the organization

262
00:15:03.021 --> 00:15:07.490
that deals with astronautical things are proposing to get together in the coming

263
00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:09.050
year to have a symposium,

264
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:13.820
to look at the scientific and the political and whatever other arguments

265
00:15:13.821 --> 00:15:18.200
go into this to see if we need to actually have a definition of where is space

266
00:15:18.201 --> 00:15:19.130
and what that might be.

267
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.550
We made a video a couple of years ago saying Voyager's left the solar system and

268
00:15:22.551 --> 00:15:23.810
just left the solar system again.

269
00:15:23.811 --> 00:15:27.470
So most things in space don't have a hard edge.

270
00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:32.690
And that means that different definitions can apply. Uh, and you can argue to,

271
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.530
till the cows come home about whether Pluto is a planet or where the solar

272
00:15:36.531 --> 00:15:39.350
system ends or how big is the Milky way.

273
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:44.300
And to some extent you will never get a satisfying answer because science

274
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.360
often comes with caveats that say, it depends what you mean.

275
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.520
<v 2>I can tilt it,</v>

276
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:56.710
but you'll notice that the access of the spin keeps pointing the same direction.

277
00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:59.590
<v 3>Things. But the main thing it does is creates a huge problem,</v>

278
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.250
because if you're a theoretical physicist, you can do a calculation that says,

279
00:16:03.251 --> 00:16:05.410
okay, so I'm creating all these virtual particles.
