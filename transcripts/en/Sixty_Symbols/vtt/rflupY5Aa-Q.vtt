1
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.600
<v 0>It is quite amazing. I mean, usually,</v>

2
00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:07.710
so this is a very big collaboration of people and usually word leaks out

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.380
somewhere. The sort of analogous thing that happened, not that long ago,

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.220
where the first results about gravitational waves and there the world kind of

5
00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:16.740
nods and winks going on. And if you knew the right people,

6
00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:18.840
then you could probably get a little bit of an inside track.

7
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.730
This has been absolutely nothing. They really kept it completely under wraps.

8
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.790
The data they're going to be presenting today was actually taken in 2017.

9
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.060
So they've been analyzing for the last couple of years is kind of the nature of

10
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:31.890
this data. It is incredibly complex.

11
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:35.610
So actually getting it to a point where you go from the raw data to something

12
00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:39.060
that looks like an impressive in image is a lot of work. Um, and they,

13
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.670
so that would have taken most of the last couple of years, but, uh,

14
00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:43.950
at this point they must know that they've got something good.

15
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.950
So this thing called the event horizon is kind of that point of no return.

16
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:50.490
It's the point where you can not even light can no longer escape from,

17
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.050
from the region around a black hole.

18
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.260
The region we would hope to see today is a bit bigger than that.

19
00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:59.490
It's probably about two or three times that event horizon size. Um,

20
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.020
really because,

21
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.690
well it's because of the distorting effects are so strong because what we're

22
00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:07.230
actually going to see is sort of light from around the black hole radio wave

23
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:12.030
light. Um, and that radio wave light is originating a little bit further away.

24
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.570
And also this you've got this massive object in the case of the one in the

25
00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:18.720
middle of the Milky way. It's about 4 million times the mass of the sun,

26
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.570
which really means that the poles of light you think about light traveling in

27
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:22.231
straight lines,

28
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:26.070
but because the gravitational field is so intense and the space-time is so

29
00:01:26.071 --> 00:01:28.470
curved, the light actually travels in very bent,

30
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.500
pause technique they're using is the thing called very long baseline

31
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:35.790
interferometry. So the object that they're trying to resolve the size of this,

32
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.270
the event horizon is about 30 times the radius of the sun.

33
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.250
So it's absolutely tiny at the distance of the galactic center. Um, and, uh,

34
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:45.930
the region that they're trying to see is a bit bigger than that,

35
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:47.400
but it's still absolutely tiny. The,

36
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.970
the analogy that's been drawn is it's like trying to take a picture of a golf

37
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:51.930
ball on the moon. Okay.

38
00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:56.910
So the technique and the technique they using really involves making the

39
00:01:56.911 --> 00:01:58.530
diameter of the telescope bigger and bigger.

40
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.950
And so one thing you can do is instead of having a single telescope,

41
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.330
you'd have multiple telescopes,

42
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.910
and then as you move them further and further apart,

43
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:08.430
the sharpness of the image increases because of the,

44
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:11.880
the ultimate sharpness is limited by the distance between your two most distant

45
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:14.430
parts of your telescope. In the technique they're using,

46
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.580
they're actually recording the data on different radio telescopes,

47
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.710
all around the world. So these enormous it's,

48
00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:22.590
the diameter of the earth is the diameter of the telescope they're using.

49
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.530
But then the tricky part is then having collected all that data,

50
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:28.530
you then have to combine it all together. And that's this,

51
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.860
the technique that they're using this thing called very long baseline

52
00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:35.340
interferometry in both taking all that signal, um, and actually is.

53
00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:36.720
So they collect so much data.

54
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:38.640
It's not something you can just transfer over the internet.

55
00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:41.550
They actually end up recording the data on hard drives shipping,

56
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:44.520
the hard drives to a place where you can kind of correlate all that data

57
00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:48.690
together and combining the information from the telescopes to extract an image

58
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.570
from it. So the trouble is everyone has in their mind, the,

59
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.980
the movie interstellar, right?

60
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.040
Because they had the most amazing graphics of what one of these supermassive

61
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:59.170
black holes would look like. Um, and they were actually, you know,

62
00:02:59.171 --> 00:03:01.030
they had real physicists involved in it.

63
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:04.600
There was actually lots of serious general relativistic calculations went into

64
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:05.740
making those, uh,

65
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.560
those graphics for the movie because the trouble is they could do that at

66
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:12.370
whatever resolution they wanted really limited by the resolution that we can

67
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:15.100
achieve with the wavelengths that we have with the diameter of the earth that we

68
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:19.810
have, which really means that you're not going to see those incredibly pin sharp

69
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:22.690
images. The whole thing is going to be a bit blurry. Um,

70
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.770
but hopefully it's going to be a blurry image of something really exciting and a

71
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:30.010
blurry image of something really exciting is probably pretty exciting itself.

72
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.300
There was one of the things I mentioned,

73
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:33.970
which is that there's another candidate out there they're actually observed two

74
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:36.340
objects. So they are observed the objects in the middle of the,

75
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:40.960
of the Milky way, um, which is this black hole of about 4 million times,

76
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:42.820
the mass of the, of the sun. Uh,

77
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.900
they also were looking at the black hole in the middle of a much bigger galaxy

78
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.320
MSCI, 87 in the middle of the Virgo cluster, um,

79
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.800
which is several thousand times further away. So actually the, the,

80
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:57.130
the quality of the images will be several thousand times poorer because you're

81
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:59.740
trying to look at something further away. So everything's much smaller,

82
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.990
but the black hole in the middle of MSCI,

83
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:05.800
87 is several thousand times bigger than the black hole in the middle of the

84
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:08.160
Milky way. And it turns out that, uh, uh,

85
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.770
event horizon size scales with the mass of the, of the black hole.

86
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.830
So if you've got a black hole, which is a couple of thousand times bigger, uh,

87
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.660
in mass than its its event,

88
00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:18.700
horizon will be a couple of thousand times bigger as well.

89
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:20.200
So the whole thing scales up in size.

90
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.950
So it turns out the ultimate sharpness of the image that they will get from the

91
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.990
black hole in the middle of MSCI. 87 is about the same as from the Milky way.

92
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.740
Um, and it's a bit of a toss up, which one's going to make the nicer pictures.

93
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.810
I think my bet is still on the Milky way.

94
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.570
Cause it's actually works that when you do the calculations, it works out,

95
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.060
you end up with slightly sharper images for the Milky way,

96
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:40.900
but there's not much in it.

97
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.650
<v 1>Yeah. Did you bring up</v>

98
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.930
that this is

99
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.550
[inaudible] and this is the first step

100
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.120
you can capture. These dimensions are not sufficient.

101
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.910
If you want to know what net black on it looks.

102
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.560
<v 0>Um, so for, from our chatting before the press conference,</v>

103
00:05:22.561 --> 00:05:24.480
I was wrong and I was raped. Right.

104
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.400
I was wrong because I picked the wrong black hole.

105
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.050
I said they were looking at two,

106
00:05:28.051 --> 00:05:30.930
the one at the middle of the Milky way and the one in MSCI 87.

107
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.230
And I thought they'd be more likely to find something about how one, um,

108
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.990
but it turns out that this is the one they got the result from today's

109
00:05:36.991 --> 00:05:38.310
announcement was pretty special actually,

110
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.520
because I've been working on black holes myself for 20 years.

111
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.990
I did my PhD in black holes.

112
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.600
I've been working on ever since in one form or another.

113
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.250
So today it feels like quite profound day. Um, and to make it even more special,

114
00:05:50.251 --> 00:05:53.370
I was watching the press release downstairs, uh,

115
00:05:53.371 --> 00:05:58.280
with my six year old son and he had toy black hole

116
00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:01.160
with him and he was sitting there comparing it with a finger on the screen.

117
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.920
And it does look more or less as we were talking about before that there is this

118
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:07.370
kind of ring of fire effect, um, that there are more particularly,

119
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:09.440
you're kind of not seeing any light from the middle there.

120
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.880
And it really is just down to this effect that the light is being so bent by

121
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:15.530
this black hole, somewhere in the middle there,

122
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.170
that the light you're seeing kind of coming out around the sides is actually

123
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.370
you're being emitted around the back of the black hole and being bent right

124
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:22.760
round.

125
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.750
So I've been bent by 90 degrees and more to head towards us and into our line of

126
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:30.470
sight. And that really is sort of the definition of strong gravity right.

127
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.630
<v 2>Late to the party here. It is currently, uh,</v>

128
00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.380
two 40 Nottingham time and it's been half an hour since the results were

129
00:06:38.381 --> 00:06:43.000
released. Um, in that time I've been interviewing prospective undergraduates.

130
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.571
Um,

131
00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:47.350
and I actually made them sit down and watch the press release up until the point

132
00:06:47.351 --> 00:06:50.710
where we saw the image of the black hole. And then I,

133
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.890
I thought we better get on with the business of the interviews.

134
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.430
<v 0>Yes, it looks, it looks like our toy black hole. Um,</v>

135
00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.780
but the real black hole doesn't have eyes and the real black hole,

136
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.680
isn't this cute cuddly as well. And he said, my toy black hole,

137
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.300
it doesn't have the ring of fire around it.

138
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.880
We know that light gets bent by gravity.

139
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.310
It has been known for actually almost exactly a hundred years.

140
00:07:12.311 --> 00:07:15.130
The first measurements of this effect were made almost exactly a hundred years

141
00:07:15.131 --> 00:07:16.180
ago. Um,

142
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.780
when they were looking at what happens during a total eclipse of the sun,

143
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.560
where stars near the sun, the position of the star shifts a little bit,

144
00:07:23.561 --> 00:07:27.340
just because the light from those stars is being bent a tiny bit by the, uh,

145
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:28.390
by the gravity of the sun.

146
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.870
So we've known about this effect in kind of that weak gravity limits that things

147
00:07:31.871 --> 00:07:34.810
like can get bent a tiny bit by something as massive as the sun.

148
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.260
Now we're talking about light getting bent through 90 degrees and more,

149
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.120
and now you're talking about really, really strong gravitational fields.

150
00:07:42.121 --> 00:07:46.120
So that gets us very much into that Einstein and of general relativity.

151
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.940
If you were just presented with a picture like that and say, what's going on,

152
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.750
you could come up with many explanations as to what it was that there's a,

153
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.210
there was a cosmic donut out there in space,

154
00:07:55.211 --> 00:07:58.270
or there's a sphere and you're seeing the ages of a sphere or whatever.

155
00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.860
You know, there are lots of ways you could explain.

156
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.580
There are many things in space that looked like rings, but the thing is here.

157
00:08:03.581 --> 00:08:06.160
They said, okay. So we think that general relativity is right.

158
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.160
And we think there's a massive black hole in the middle of these galaxy.

159
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.580
And we think that it's got a lot of this sort of radio emitting material around

160
00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:16.480
it. What would we expect to see if those things were the truth?

161
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.720
And then they predicted this is what you want to see pretty much.

162
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.480
And then you go out and take the picture and there it is.

163
00:08:22.481 --> 00:08:25.260
And then so in some sense, that's the best proof the river is,

164
00:08:25.261 --> 00:08:28.690
is when you actually predict something before you go and see it. Um,

165
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.460
and so I think this, in that sense,

166
00:08:30.461 --> 00:08:34.930
this probably is the best evidence there has ever been for a supermassive black

167
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:36.520
hole in the middle of a galaxy. Okay.

168
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.250
There are lots of ways that you can get those kinds of asymmetries.

169
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.110
The most likely I think, uh,

170
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:44.050
is that what's actually happening is that the material is rotating. It's not,

171
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.450
it's not just sort of uniformly spread around there.

172
00:08:46.451 --> 00:08:49.480
It's actually spinning around because we know further out there's a disc of

173
00:08:49.481 --> 00:08:50.590
material, which is spinning around.

174
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.530
So the stuff we're staying close to the black hole is probably in a row with a

175
00:08:53.531 --> 00:08:55.590
turbulent messy way, still rotating around.

176
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.690
And what happens is the bit that's coming toward,

177
00:08:57.691 --> 00:09:01.560
you gets a big boost in energy. There's this thing called the Doppler effect.

178
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:02.640
And in lights, the way,

179
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.910
one of the ways that manifests itself is that the light gets a lot brighter.

180
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.790
There's a lot more energy in it, whereas the stuff that's going away from you,

181
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:13.230
you see it a lower energy. And so you basically see it as fainter.

182
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.740
And so I think that asymmetry we're seeing there is just to do with the rotation

183
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.420
of material around the black hole. I mean,

184
00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:20.090
there was a lot of structure there as well.

185
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.290
It looks like there's something that points out this way as well,

186
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.150
which I'm kind of intrigued by. And again,

187
00:09:24.151 --> 00:09:26.790
one of the things that might be expected as you might expect,

188
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:30.090
jets of material to be flying out of the black hole, um,

189
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.630
and the material would probably be rotating around those jets of material.

190
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.290
So it sort of fits together. But again, that's kind of down near the,

191
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.110
the limits of what you can actually see on an image like that.

192
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:45.290
<v 2>This I really, this is just my very first reaction to it. Um,</v>

193
00:09:45.291 --> 00:09:48.800
so I am really looking forward to reading about the science.

194
00:09:48.801 --> 00:09:53.030
That's come out of this about whether the structures that I'm seeing in the

195
00:09:53.031 --> 00:09:56.390
background here are real and what they mean. Um,

196
00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:00.650
and just how these predictions match up, not just on a qualitative level,

197
00:10:00.651 --> 00:10:03.800
but on a quantitative level to the data that's actually been gathered.

198
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:04.281
<v 0>I mean,</v>

199
00:10:04.281 --> 00:10:07.370
the other thing that you sort of have to take your hats off to the people

200
00:10:07.371 --> 00:10:08.510
involved in this experiment,

201
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.960
because you have to bear in mind the technique they're using via BI.

202
00:10:11.961 --> 00:10:13.910
It's not just like taking a picture with a camera.

203
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.390
You've got to take all these data from all the different radio telescopes,

204
00:10:17.391 --> 00:10:20.840
combine them all together. And from that.

205
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.780
So basically you take sort of every pair of radio telescopes,

206
00:10:23.781 --> 00:10:26.900
and you get a bit of information from the sort of the phase delay,

207
00:10:26.901 --> 00:10:28.910
the difference in the signal between each pair.

208
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.340
And each of those gives you a little bit of a picture,

209
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.830
but actually you don't have the whole picture.

210
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:38.000
And it is it's essentially because, you know, if you've got a regular camera,

211
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.070
you're kind of got your lens or your mirror,

212
00:10:40.071 --> 00:10:43.940
if it's a telescope is sort of filling the entire aperture in this case,

213
00:10:43.941 --> 00:10:47.240
you've just got a few dishes sort of scattered within your aperture.

214
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.430
That means there's a lot of missing information,

215
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.630
which means that you then have to kind of reconstruct that missing information.

216
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.650
And there are actually there isn't generally a unique solution to this.

217
00:10:57.651 --> 00:11:01.370
So there is a little bit of kind of prejudice that goes into this that says,

218
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.390
because you can, you know,

219
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.910
there are many different images you could reconstruct from those data.

220
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.040
Most of them look completely ridiculous.

221
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.220
And so you can sort of throw them out on the basis that they look on physical,

222
00:11:10.221 --> 00:11:14.330
that they they're just very noisy or they just don't match what you'd expect

223
00:11:14.331 --> 00:11:17.300
from a real astronomical object. Um, and so the sort of,

224
00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:21.650
a lot of processing that has to go in to turning this data into an image now

225
00:11:21.651 --> 00:11:24.530
what's going to happen over time is a more and more dishes get added to this

226
00:11:24.531 --> 00:11:27.440
network of telescopes. So you have more and more pairs of telescopes,

227
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.560
which gives you more and more information. So as time goes on,

228
00:11:30.561 --> 00:11:33.590
they're going to be repeating these experiments with more and more information.

229
00:11:33.591 --> 00:11:35.420
So the images will get better and better,

230
00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.450
and there'll be less of that kind of interpolation of figuring out the missing

231
00:11:38.451 --> 00:11:41.930
data, just because there'll be less missing data. Um, but for the moment,

232
00:11:41.931 --> 00:11:44.510
there's a lot of work that has to go into turning, uh,

233
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.970
the raw data into an image like this. And so that's,

234
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.300
I think fundamentally the reason why it's taken all the time from when they took

235
00:11:50.301 --> 00:11:54.040
the data two years ago to now to actually produce an image this from the data

236
00:11:54.041 --> 00:11:57.670
they collected. So there's talk about putting radio telescopes into space,

237
00:11:57.671 --> 00:12:00.820
because remember what dictates the sharpness of the image is how far apart your

238
00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:02.260
most distant parts of your telescope,

239
00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:04.510
or if you could put your telescopes into orbit,

240
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.980
if you could put one of them on the moon,

241
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.160
if you could put them all into orbit around the sun, then in principle,

242
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:12.370
you can make longer and longer baselines. There's not a lot to this picture.

243
00:12:12.371 --> 00:12:15.580
Is there really, it's like, you know, it's a ring with a hole in the middle,

244
00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:20.340
but actually I think that's absolutely astounding. How amazing is that, that,

245
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.420
that, you know, millions of light years away,

246
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:26.590
you can actually see a black hole in another galaxy down to the scale. I mean,

247
00:12:26.591 --> 00:12:29.290
the black hole, remember the, the black region in the middle,

248
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.860
it's about three times the ultimate size of the black hole itself.

249
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.290
So the black hole itself is actually not much smaller than this.

250
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:39.880
We really are getting right down into that strong gravity regime right next to

251
00:12:39.881 --> 00:12:42.130
the event, horizon of a black hole, uh,

252
00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:46.140
exceeded my expectations with our simulations of what this might look like.

253
00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:48.270
And they look more or less exactly like this,

254
00:12:48.271 --> 00:12:52.380
but I thought all with scattering of light and instrumental effects and noise,

255
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.910
you know, they'll be lucky to get it,

256
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:58.380
to get the prediction as accurately as that, but it looks bang on.

257
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.630
So it's pretty, pretty special. So we,

258
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:05.700
we're seeing this radio synchrotron radiation from the immediate vicinity of a

259
00:13:05.701 --> 00:13:06.534
black hole,

260
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:11.550
and you can see the black hole itself shadowing the light so you

261
00:13:11.551 --> 00:13:14.880
can see its influence. Um, it's pretty special. Yeah.

262
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.270
The people will be analyzing these data for years to come. I think so. Um,

263
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.690
it feels like it doesn't feel like a real breakthrough. Yeah. Well, I mean,

264
00:13:21.691 --> 00:13:23.520
so remember, you're looking at radio waves here,

265
00:13:23.521 --> 00:13:26.910
so you can actually make this any color you want it to be fundamentally. Um,

266
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.670
and they've clearly just picked something which looked nice. You know,

267
00:13:29.671 --> 00:13:32.220
you could perfectly well have done it in black and white or, you know,

268
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.980
because these are what you're really looking at here. A millimeter waves,

269
00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:37.800
not optical light at all. So yes, there are,

270
00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.770
there is a certain matter of aesthetics as to what color you end up reproducing

271
00:13:40.771 --> 00:13:43.170
these images in, and it makes a big difference.

272
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:46.440
That's the other interesting thing that NASA employees, uh,

273
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.190
graphic designers who know what looks really nice because you do have that

274
00:13:50.191 --> 00:13:53.220
degree of freedom because it is all about how you present the data.

275
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.950
And you know, it's not, there's no dishonesty here in that.

276
00:13:55.951 --> 00:13:58.980
The reason I write color. Cause as I say, these are radio waves, radio waves,

277
00:13:58.981 --> 00:14:00.900
aren't either blue or green they're radio waves.

278
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.810
So actually you really can pick whatever color looks nicest. Yeah.

279
00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:05.700
For galaxy is the size of a football.

280
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:09.540
The supermassive black hole in the nucleus is the size of a hydrogen atom.

281
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:13.170
So that absolutely tiny, but the energy they can produce is,

282
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:18.000
and they can more than enough to blow the galaxy to bits many times over.

283
00:14:18.001 --> 00:14:22.590
So they, uh, understanding the link between these supermassive black holes,

284
00:14:22.591 --> 00:14:23.630
like the one they found, they,

285
00:14:23.631 --> 00:14:27.210
they announced today and the broader galaxies that they're embedded in.

286
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.600
I think that's a really key issue for me personally.

287
00:14:30.601 --> 00:14:34.230
It's an area I work on and how the galaxies form, how do they switch offs?

288
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.990
Forming stars, black holes may play a role.

289
00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.000
And now we know that the really old black holes are there.

290
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:42.990
So we knew that before, but we've got an actual image of one for the first time.

291
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.120
So there's been loads of evidence for black holes,

292
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:49.140
but no actual image to take a picture of one.

293
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:50.430
So it's pretty special.

294
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.350
<v 3>We've made quite a few.</v>

295
00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.360
<v 4>The video is about black holes. Over the years,</v>

296
00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.020
I'm going to put a link in the video description and here on the screen,

297
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.780
also our astronomy channel, deep sky videos.

298
00:15:01.781 --> 00:15:04.990
We've got a video all about M 87 already on there.

299
00:15:04.991 --> 00:15:07.630
So if you want to find out more about mad seven again,

300
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:09.820
