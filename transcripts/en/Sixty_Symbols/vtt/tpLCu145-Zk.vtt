00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.640
<v 0>How do I pronounce the star? Well, that's a good question.</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.910
So I run a Twitter poll and the answer is nobody seems to know.

3
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.200
<v 1>What do you say when you were at an astronomy conference and someone says,</v>

4
00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:10.580
so professor Merrifield,

5
00:00:10.581 --> 00:00:13.100
what do you think about the latest happenings on [inaudible]?

6
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.910
<v 0>Uh, I, I don't go to that kind of conference cause I don't do stars.</v>

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.610
It's difficult because it's a corruption of an Arabic name.

8
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.690
So actually quite how you're supposed to pronounce a corrupted Arabic name.

9
00:00:23.691 --> 00:00:26.780
I'm not sure. Um, so you can really pronounce it, how you like,

10
00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:28.040
but let's go with beetle traditionally.

11
00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.480
It's a star it's relatively massive star. About 10 times the mass of the sun.

12
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.580
It's if you look at the constellation of Orion,

13
00:00:34.581 --> 00:00:36.590
which is one of the few that most people recognize,

14
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.110
it's the star at the top left of, of Orion.

15
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.980
And the reason why everyone's excited about it is because it's fading at the

16
00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:44.420
moment quite dramatically.

17
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.440
And the other interesting fact about it is that in astronomical terms,

18
00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:50.960
it's likely to blow up sometime in the near future.

19
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.860
And people have kind of put these two facts together and equated the fact that

20
00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:57.260
it's fading at the moment as a sign that is about to go.

21
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.620
<v 1>Wow, is it about to go?</v>

22
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.300
<v 0>I think it's unlikely. So I was a bit careful in what I said,</v>

23
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.830
and I said in astronomical terms, it's going to go pretty soon.

24
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.010
And that just basically means it's probably going to blow up sometime in the

25
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:11.570
next hundred and 50,000 years.

26
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.870
So the chances of it being tomorrow are pretty slim,

27
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.620
I would say is actually well documented as a variable star.

28
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.880
It has its some sort of quasi periodic things or some longish timescale

29
00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:25.010
variation. There's a shortage timescale variation.

30
00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:29.540
So there's lots of variability going in on it. It is a complete mess.

31
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.950
And so actually, although this is the faintest it's been in recent times,

32
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.320
it's not really unprecedented for it to be fading.

33
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.390
<v 1>If, and when it does blow up,</v>

34
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.930
will that be proceeded by a sudden and dramatic fade?

35
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.130
<v 0>Nobody knows because no one's ever seen one of these things that close up and</v>

36
00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:48.230
seen it before it blew up to know what it's going to do.

37
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.740
So no one really quite knows. And the reason,

38
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.640
part of the reason why no one knows is because it really is a very messy system.

39
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.520
It's big extended bloated kind of thing.

40
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.740
There's all sorts of processes going on in it.

41
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.880
So quite what the sequence of events would be that you'd actually see from the

42
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:07.700
outside is really something of a mystery at this point.

43
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:09.140
<v 1>Oh,</v>

44
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.110
I thought we modeled stars all the time and we've got all these theories about

45
00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:16.280
what the explosion looks like and how it's soap soaping over works and like a

46
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.480
will supernova, presumably.

47
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.480
<v 0>We are supernova and yet you're right. You know,</v>

48
00:02:20.481 --> 00:02:24.320
we sort of have a broad brush understanding and the sort of the physics that's

49
00:02:24.321 --> 00:02:25.970
going on, but it's like, you know,

50
00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:27.980
it's like the difference between climate and weather, right?

51
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.380
That actually even if you think, you know, what's going on in the climate,

52
00:02:30.381 --> 00:02:31.310
you don't know what tomorrow is,

53
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.340
whether it's going to be like a really what's going on in the outer layers is

54
00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:36.710
very much the weather and the, the,

55
00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:39.260
the climate is the explosion that's going to occur right.

56
00:02:39.261 --> 00:02:42.560
In the core of it and how these two things are coupled together is really quite

57
00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:46.010
complicated. So we really don't know what you'd expect to see in the days,

58
00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:47.600
months, years leading up to the explosion.

59
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.790
<v 1>Because before this Beetlejuice stuff, if you'd asked me Brady,</v>

60
00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:56.630
what do you think happens to a star in the year or two or the week or two before

61
00:02:56.631 --> 00:03:00.220
it blows up? I would have said, Oh, I bet it gets really, really bright.

62
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.880
<v 0>And if you'd asked me the same question, I'd probably have said the same thing.</v>

63
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:06.910
You'd think that that would be the, what would be going on. But as I say,

64
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:09.490
it really is because what's going on right in the middle,

65
00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:13.270
where there were probably also pretty frantic nuclear processes going on, right.

66
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:14.980
In those low dying days of the star.

67
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:18.400
And what you actually see in the outer parts are really only very loosely

68
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:19.234
coupled together.

69
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.360
So really isn't that clear what you'd end up seeing in those last few weeks.

70
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.470
<v 1>But you think like if you're a betting, man.</v>

71
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.600
<v 0>I'd be prepared to put a fair amount of money on it, not going in my lifetime,</v>

72
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.840
which would be a shame because I'd love to see it. But, uh, no, probably not.

73
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.900
If we do a bit of a job of an astronomy for a while, actually,

74
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.890
because when it does go,

75
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.680
it's going to be brighter than the moon or about as bright as the moon.

76
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.300
And so the kind of astronomy I do, I tend to do away from full moon. Um,

77
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.940
and this going to be like having another bright light up there,

78
00:03:47.941 --> 00:03:50.880
this is almost as bright as the full moon. So for a year or so,

79
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.850
the kind of astronomy I like doing is going to be quite hard to do because

80
00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:55.860
there'll be this new, bright light in the sky.

81
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.680
<v 1>Or Avon muscular, the ruined sky by then, it's true.</v>

82
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.650
<v 0>Um, you know, for the dramatic,</v>

83
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.710
for the drama of getting to see a stall blowing up,

84
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.770
I'm prepared to put up with not doing my kind of astronomy for a year. I think.

85
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.200
<v 1>You said you'd be willing to put money on it not being in your lifetime. Yup.</v>

86
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.690
That should run markets on astronomy events. I don't really ever do that.

87
00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:18.961
Do they?

88
00:04:18.961 --> 00:04:22.080
I've never like you can bet on everything aren't you can bet on who's going to

89
00:04:22.081 --> 00:04:25.380
be the next prime minister and who's going to be that they should have bets on

90
00:04:25.381 --> 00:04:26.214
astronomical event.

91
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.560
<v 0>I bet you could, you know, if you wanted to,</v>

92
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.010
I'm sure your local bookie would be able to figure out some words for you.

93
00:04:32.011 --> 00:04:35.550
If you wanted to. I actually have a national local bet which has been running.

94
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.680
I don't actually know. I don't know where the betting slip is.

95
00:04:37.681 --> 00:04:40.260
I'm going to have to find it one of these days, which is the,

96
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.180
I put a bet that they would find life on Mars years and years and years ago.

97
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.400
And it was quite an interesting process actually. Cause I,

98
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.670
I went to the bookmakers and they obviously, they couldn't do anything there.

99
00:04:50.671 --> 00:04:52.710
And then, but then they, they, they have specialists, right?

100
00:04:52.711 --> 00:04:54.210
And they put you in touch with their specialists.

101
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.040
And I had a chat with a specialist.

102
00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.090
I had assumed that they would like insist there being some time to it, you know,

103
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.640
that you find life on Mars sometime in the next 10 years,

104
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.680
because otherwise it's just a bed that goes on and on forever.

105
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.440
But actually it turns out they don't care cause they get to keep your money

106
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:08.970
until the bit settled.

107
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.260
So I have this bed that they will find life on Mars and there were various

108
00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:13.771
criteria.

109
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:16.670
Like it had to be non microscopic and those kinds of things that bacteria

110
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.530
wouldn't count and those kinds of stuff. Um, so.

111
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.540
<v 1>What were you thinking? You weren't thinking little green men.</v>

112
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.320
<v 0>I reckon. Well, I, I, I didn't know what I was thinking. Really.</v>

113
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.930
I just thought it was a fun thing to find out whether you could put a bet on

114
00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:31.170
finding life on Mars or not rather than actually thinking they'd find anything.

115
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.230
Um, and I think I'm trying to remember the exact terms.

116
00:05:34.231 --> 00:05:37.200
It didn't actually have to be alive so they could find like fossil remains.

117
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.370
So as long as it wasn't like microscopic that then uh, then it would,

118
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.070
I would win the bet, but I have to find the betting slip one of these days.

119
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.250
<v 1>Do you think you're going to lose that bail or do you still think you might win?</v>

120
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.150
That is a winning.

121
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.180
<v 0>And there's still a chance. All right. In here it's still a little,</v>

122
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.253
maybe it'll pay off.

123
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.160
<v 1>No know Mars was a much nicer.</v>

124
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.920
<v 0>Place a long time ago and you know, there was water around,</v>

125
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:04.310
there was an atmosphere. And so you who knows maybe there was like.

126
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.940
<v 1>When Beetlejuice does go, yes. Do we know any, is there anything,</v>

127
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.600
will we get any clues that it's about to go? We will get a little bit warmer.

128
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.920
<v 0>I was intrigued by this,</v>

129
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.520
in that I heard various stories about whether we get any advance warning or not.

130
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.230
And the answer is we will.

131
00:06:20.231 --> 00:06:24.130
And so I found a paper that was published a couple of years ago,

132
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.150
neutrinos from Bita processes in a pre supernova,

133
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.510
probing the isotopic evolution of a massive star.

134
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.340
They do a calculation of what the last few hours of a

135
00:06:36.341 --> 00:06:39.250
Star's life is like just before it goes supernova.

136
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.050
I remember the way a star is powered is it burns the various, uh,

137
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.600
chemical elements from one to the next. So by nuclear fusion,

138
00:06:46.601 --> 00:06:49.600
it will turn hydrogen into helium and then helium into carbon and so on up

139
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.920
creating heavier and heavier elements. And the problem with doing that,

140
00:06:53.921 --> 00:06:58.600
if you're a star, is that each time you get less and less bang for your buck,

141
00:06:58.601 --> 00:07:00.970
you know, each the, the hydrogen to helium processes,

142
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.880
you get quite a lot of energy out helium to carbon, a bit less.

143
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.340
And so on in each time you get less and less energy out,

144
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.550
which means that in order for the star to kind of hold itself up,

145
00:07:09.551 --> 00:07:13.210
it has to burn things at an ever more frantic rate in order to do so.

146
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.340
So the last stages of burning are really very intense, but not very energetic.

147
00:07:18.341 --> 00:07:20.860
They don't actually produce much energy and they don't last very long because it

148
00:07:20.861 --> 00:07:22.600
uses up the fuel very, very quickly.

149
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.770
And so this is looking at those last few stages and asking, you know,

150
00:07:26.771 --> 00:07:28.990
what all the processes, and actually more importantly,

151
00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:31.900
is there anything we could detect that would tell us that those processes were

152
00:07:31.901 --> 00:07:33.790
going on and in particular,

153
00:07:33.791 --> 00:07:37.180
the thing that will get straight out from the star or the neutrinos.

154
00:07:37.181 --> 00:07:41.950
So one of the byproducts of lots of nuclear reactions is that you produce these

155
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.110
pathetic little particles called neutrinos.

156
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.770
Basically whenever you turn a neutron into a proton or a proton into a neutron

157
00:07:47.771 --> 00:07:49.240
in some process, um,

158
00:07:49.241 --> 00:07:53.740
you tend to produce one of these neutrinos and neutrinos are such wimpy little

159
00:07:53.741 --> 00:07:57.100
particles that they'll actually travel straight through the star. Um,

160
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.310
and so they don't really care. There's a whole body of a star around it.

161
00:08:00.311 --> 00:08:04.180
So any neutrinos that are produced will stream straight out and what these guys

162
00:08:04.181 --> 00:08:05.710
did is they did some calculations as to say,

163
00:08:05.711 --> 00:08:09.460
how many of these neutrinos are there. And in those last few frantic hours,

164
00:08:09.461 --> 00:08:12.010
when you're burning all these things, as quickly as you possibly can,

165
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.040
it turns out the processes are so intense. You make a lot of neutrinos.

166
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.020
<v 1>So start spends all that time,</v>

167
00:08:17.021 --> 00:08:20.920
burning fuel and over millions of years.

168
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.160
But the final fuel event is something measured over hours.

169
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.080
<v 0>Three hours. So we did,</v>

170
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.140
and it really is that frantic that is desperately trying to stay alive.

171
00:08:29.141 --> 00:08:31.240
And so it's using up all the fuel that possibly can.

172
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.170
<v 1>Sad almost. It's pretty pathetic. Really? It's like it's drowning.</v>

173
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.960
<v 0>Yeah, no, it really is this frantic. Oh my God, I want God.</v>

174
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:41.260
I've got to keep going. It just keeps burning all these things. And eventually,

175
00:08:41.261 --> 00:08:44.110
you know, it just runs out or things to burn. So they do these calculations,

176
00:08:44.111 --> 00:08:48.820
they figure out how many neutrinos get produced. And so here they are,

177
00:08:48.821 --> 00:08:51.880
this is the number of neutrinos is being produced per second. And so the,

178
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.030
they did a couple of calculations, 15 solar masses and 30 solar masses.

179
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.990
Beetle juice is around probably around 10, but this,

180
00:08:57.991 --> 00:09:00.300
so this is reasonably close to the kind of thing that will be going on and

181
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:01.650
beetle juice. And you can see,

182
00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:05.310
this is the luminosity in the number of these things being produced per second.

183
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.920
And you can see as it's coming up towards the end here,

184
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.080
the curves all going up and up and up and up,

185
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.180
but this is one hour before the thing goes,

186
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.950
we're looking at 10 to the 52 neutrinos being produced for second.

187
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:20.460
So it's a huge number of neutrinos. Then of course,

188
00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:23.010
they split out through space. So by the time they get to the earth,

189
00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:23.970
so many fewer of them,

190
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:28.140
and then you need a neutrino detector and that's a hard thing to do because

191
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.680
neutrinos just pass straight through everything. And so stopping neutrinos,

192
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:33.420
detecting neutrinos is a hard thing to do,

193
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.690
but we have some neutrino detectors on earth and they're mostly designed to do

194
00:09:36.691 --> 00:09:38.400
things like detect neutrinos from the sun,

195
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.910
but it turns out that we might actually hope to detect some of these using the

196
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.740
earth bound neutrino detectors.

197
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.740
So they go through that bit of the calculation as well to figure out what you'd

198
00:09:46.741 --> 00:09:50.310
actually expect to see. So they looked at various neutrino detectors,

199
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.440
June and Juno don't actually exist yet.

200
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.510
So the ones that are being built at the moment,

201
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.480
super Kamiyah Conda is one that does exist now.

202
00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:00.570
And they add up all the neutrinos you'd expect to detect.

203
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.330
And they reckon you'd detect slightly less than half a neutrino,

204
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:08.040
which doesn't sound too promising until you realize that this calculation was

205
00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:08.460
done,

206
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:13.170
assuming a star that was about five times further away than beetle

207
00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:17.220
uses. And so the number of new, so the neutrino is spread out through space.

208
00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:19.020
They kind of fill the whole area,

209
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.050
which means that the number of neutrinos you would detect,

210
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:27.060
decreases as one over the distance squared. So if the thing's five times closer,

211
00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:29.430
that means you see 25 times as many neutrinos.

212
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.550
So are half a neutrino turns into about 12 neutrinos.

213
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.650
That doesn't sound very many,

214
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.330
but remember that the only previous time we've detected neutrinos from a

215
00:10:39.331 --> 00:10:43.890
supernova was when the supernova went off in 1987 in the large Medtronic cloud.

216
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.340
And there, they got very excited because they detected 10 neutrinos.

217
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.790
So this is kind of in the ballpark that people are used to detecting from

218
00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:53.730
neutrinos and getting excited about when they detect them. Um,

219
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.260
so actually it will sort of set off the neutrino alarms when it happens and they

220
00:10:58.261 --> 00:11:00.600
will actually have this advance notice. They even,

221
00:11:00.601 --> 00:11:02.640
I think have some directional information.

222
00:11:02.641 --> 00:11:05.790
So I'll even know that these are neutrinos that came from the general direction

223
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:06.380
of beetle juice.

224
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.610
<v 1>Is there a system in place for the detector to tell all the telescopes to swing</v>

225
00:11:10.611 --> 00:11:12.140
around and point at Beetlejuice?

226
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.030
<v 0>I'm not sure there is. Um,</v>

227
00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.690
and actually I'm not sure they can process the data that quickly, whether the,

228
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.630
whether it would only, you only find out after the fact,

229
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.880
which is what happened with supernova in 1987 80,

230
00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:24.770
they actually only found out afterwards that actually yes,

231
00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:26.510
we did detect it in neutrinos.

232
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:29.540
The good news is if it hangs on for a few more years,

233
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:33.470
these other neutrino detectors come online and you can see that actually were

234
00:11:33.471 --> 00:11:36.380
super coming to condos. Only detecting half a neutrino.

235
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.500
The Juno detector will detect 17. So, and again,

236
00:11:39.501 --> 00:11:42.860
remember that will go up by a factor of 25 just because it's closer than that.

237
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:45.080
So if we wait around until Juno's online,

238
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.120
then we'll detect lots and lots of neutrinos.

239
00:11:47.121 --> 00:11:50.450
And that really would be a big burst that would be set off some alarms.

240
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.940
<v 1>You talk about advanced notice,</v>

241
00:11:52.941 --> 00:11:56.050
but that's not because anything bad will happen if Beetlejuice blows up.

242
00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.980
<v 0>Not to us. No, we're far enough away that actually all you'll see is a nice,</v>

243
00:11:58.981 --> 00:12:01.560
big, bright light in the sky. Um, but it's not the, you know,

244
00:12:01.561 --> 00:12:04.770
the gamma rays or anything like that. I'm going to kill us from, uh,

245
00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.600
beetle juice when it goes, huh.

246
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:10.350
<v 1>This is a long way away. Isn't it? So this is like all stuff in the past.</v>

247
00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:15.300
<v 0>Yes, it's a 700 light years away. So yeah, it could have gone by now.</v>

248
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:19.020
And we might have to wait around for a few hundred years for the event to get to

249
00:12:19.021 --> 00:12:19.470
us.

250
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:23.190
<v 1>The neutrinos, travel to earth at the same speed as light. So like,</v>

251
00:12:23.191 --> 00:12:25.680
it's not like the explosion will overtake the neutrinos.

252
00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.360
<v 0>And in fact, because,</v>

253
00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.990
and because there'll be neutrinos created in the explosion itself and again,

254
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.910
a really, really big number of neutrinos.

255
00:12:32.911 --> 00:12:35.040
So actually this is the sort of pre supernova stuff.

256
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.430
But when the explosion really goes, there'll be a huge burden neutrinos.

257
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.180
And actually they will get to us before we see the light because the neutrinos

258
00:12:42.181 --> 00:12:43.410
come streaming straight out,

259
00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.770
but you've got to have this explosive shockwave has got to work its way through

260
00:12:46.771 --> 00:12:49.990
this, uh, the body of the star before we actually see the,

261
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.370
the light of the supernova. So in fact, when the supernova goes,

262
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.750
we'll get a little bit more warning,

263
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:57.750
but the neutrinos will arrive before the explosion does.

264
00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.510
<v 1>The earth is safe. Is that, let me something that far away,</v>

265
00:13:00.511 --> 00:13:01.290
it's not like we're going,

266
00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:03.420
like there's going to be any warmth heading towards earth.

267
00:13:03.421 --> 00:13:04.380
It's going to cook us though.

268
00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.610
<v 0>As I say, all we'll see is it will be a dramatically bright light in the sky,</v>

269
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.680
but nothing's going to fry how dramatic.

270
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.630
<v 1>Where you see it in the daytime and it'll.</v>

271
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:15.360
<v 0>Be visible in daytime. It'll be about the same brightness as the moon,</v>

272
00:13:15.361 --> 00:13:18.150
so visible in during the day, um, for,

273
00:13:18.151 --> 00:13:21.630
and I think you'll see it during the day for a matter of weeks or months,

274
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:24.060
and it will be visible to the naked eye for a year or so.

275
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:25.523
<v 1>Awesome.</v>

276
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:30.660
Has there ever been a supernova in our galaxy that we've observed?

277
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.770
Yeah.

278
00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:36.360
<v 0>Not in recent times. I mean, there were there's so the Chinese records has,</v>

279
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.050
uh, records of supernovae ran with a thousand years ago.

280
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.940
So there have been supernovae in them in the Milky way. Nebula was one of those.

281
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.490
Exactly. The crab memory was one. The only one that sort of in,

282
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.490
in recent times was supernova 1987,

283
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.640
which was in the large managed Niantic cloud in our near neighbor rather than

284
00:13:53.641 --> 00:13:54.810
actually being in our galaxy.

285
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:59.010
<v 1>Okay. Uh, I'd love to see one would be pretty cool.</v>

286
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:01.270
You should call the bookmaker and find out what odds they'll.

287
00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.060
<v 0>On. Beetle juice going. Yeah,</v>

288
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.820
probably not very good at the moment because there's been so much noise about

289
00:14:05.821 --> 00:14:08.040
it. So you didn't see the picture.

290
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.300
So here's a picture. This is what Beatles is.

291
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:15.090
Just to give you a sense of what a super giant star actually looks like.

292
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.340
This is a picture of beetle juice.

293
00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:22.050
It's sufficiently big that with the very high resolution, uh, uh,

294
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.410
telescopes that we have, like the Atacama large millimeter array,

295
00:14:25.411 --> 00:14:27.240
where we can see the squeezy detail,

296
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.660
we can actually make a picture of the disk of the star itself.

297
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.560
And that's partly because this telescope can make incredibly high resolution

298
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:35.191
sharp images,

299
00:14:35.191 --> 00:14:37.860
but it's partly because the thing's enormous in that somebody's drawn on here.

300
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.920
What the orbits of the planets in the solar system would be.

301
00:14:40.921 --> 00:14:43.920
And you can see that actually it's bigger than the orbit of Jupiter.

302
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.260
It's a truly enormous object.

303
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.050
The other thing you can see about it is it is a complete mess, right?

304
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:52.610
That actually is not a nice, uh, uniforms, fear.

305
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.140
There's a bright patch over here.

306
00:14:54.141 --> 00:14:58.040
There's indications that it's not even exactly round that's because it is this

307
00:14:58.041 --> 00:15:01.070
very sort of churning convective system.

308
00:15:01.071 --> 00:15:04.580
It has huge convective cells as things, rising things, falling, things,

309
00:15:04.581 --> 00:15:09.020
being spat out. That actually it's a very, uh, non relaxed system.

310
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.560
And that I think is probably what lies behind the current fading.

311
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.300
That there's one of these phenomenons going on. That's just,

312
00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:17.600
maybe it spat out a load of dust or something that,

313
00:15:17.601 --> 00:15:18.920
which is currently obscuring it.

314
00:15:18.921 --> 00:15:22.580
So we're all we're currently seeing is just one of these processes that's going

315
00:15:22.581 --> 00:15:25.790
on in the outer layers of the star, um, which just,

316
00:15:25.791 --> 00:15:27.650
just made it fight in this rather dramatic way.

317
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.290
<v 1>The stars, this big have planetary systems, as I understand them, like, do they.</v>

318
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.480
