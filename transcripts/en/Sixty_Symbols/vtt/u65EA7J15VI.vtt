00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.541
<v 0>Professor.</v>

2
00:00:00.541 --> 00:00:04.410
I didn't think I'd be talking to you again so soon after we saw your backyard

3
00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:07.530
astronomy, but we've got breaking use in space.

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.690
You've been imaging it what's going on up there.

5
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.680
<v 1>Yeah. It's not often that we get things happening, you know,</v>

6
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.710
as stock presses we have for this particular event,

7
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.400
but there's been a supernova has gone off in Messiaen 61.

8
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.890
So one of our messier objects has put you on a show at the moment.

9
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.830
<v 0>No, there are different types of supernova. What's this particular one.</v>

10
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.870
<v 1>This is a type two supernova,</v>

11
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.080
which means that when you split the light of it up into a spectrum,

12
00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:33.380
you find the absorption lines of hydrogen in the spectrum.

13
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.620
So what this is telling you is that whatever is exploding,

14
00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:38.180
you're seeing through a lot of hydrogen.

15
00:00:38.181 --> 00:00:42.110
So the hydrogen is kind of obscuring a bit of the explosion and absorbing some

16
00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:46.040
of the light. And that tells you that what you're looking at is a massive star,

17
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.610
which still has all its sort of outer layers of hydrogen on it.

18
00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:52.700
So there's an explosion going on in the core of this star that we're seeing

19
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:55.100
through the outer layers of hydrogen of the star itself.

20
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.650
<v 0>So it still had lots of fuel in the tank, sort of.</v>

21
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.170
<v 1>It has fuel. And some of it will still be actually physically bound to the star.</v>

22
00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:03.611
Some of it,

23
00:01:03.611 --> 00:01:07.250
it will have blown out into space in the late stages of its lifetime. Um,

24
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.820
but yes,

25
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.360
most doors end up with a lot of their hydrogen leftover before they blow up.

26
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.380
<v 0>Okay. So can you talk me through what a type two supernova actually is?</v>

27
00:01:15.381 --> 00:01:19.790
What happened to this elevated star sitting there and M 61?

28
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.700
<v 1>So this is a store right at the end of its life.</v>

29
00:01:22.701 --> 00:01:26.270
It's a lot more massive than the sun is at least eight times the mass of the

30
00:01:26.271 --> 00:01:30.320
sun. And it's gone through all the nuclear fuel burning stages,

31
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.420
turning hydrogen into helium, into carbon,

32
00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:34.610
into all the heavier elements it's run out of fuel.

33
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.780
And the nuclear fusion is really what holds the star up. You know,

34
00:01:38.781 --> 00:01:41.120
the pull of gravity is trying to pull it in, was on itself.

35
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.010
And the nuclear reactions in the center are generating the energy necessary to

36
00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:49.460
hold it up against gravity. When you run out of those reactions,

37
00:01:49.461 --> 00:01:54.230
the whole thing just collapses down and ends up imploding.

38
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.980
Essentially the whole star collapses down, uh, onto the center of,

39
00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.240
of where the star used to be.

40
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.380
You end up forming a neutron star right at the center.

41
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.460
As everything gets very compressed,

42
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.260
the star then sort of bounces off that neutron star flings its outer layers out,

43
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.180
turns out that's not quite the whole story.

44
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:13.910
That's not enough to make the star explode completely.

45
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.360
But the other thing that happens is the neutron star in the center is initially

46
00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:20.210
incredibly hot and starts cooling down.

47
00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:24.530
And part of the way it cools down is by producing pairs of neutrinos,

48
00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:29.120
which then also fly out through the star. Some of those interact with the gas,

49
00:02:29.121 --> 00:02:32.450
that's just being flung out and end up creating the enormous explosion that we

50
00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:33.110
see.

51
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.260
<v 0>The location that this has happened within the galaxies of interest too.</v>

52
00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:40.460
Isn't it? It seems to be in one of the arms of galaxy. Is that normal?

53
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.610
<v 1>Yeah, I mean, so it's a very massive star.</v>

54
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.270
Massive stars have very short lifetimes, at least by stellar standards.

55
00:02:47.271 --> 00:02:49.490
We're talking about, you know, hundreds of thousands to millions of years,

56
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.820
which really means that they don't move very far from where they were born

57
00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:56.210
before they blow up and most stars form inspire at arms.

58
00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.190
So because it hasn't had time to move out of its sort of, uh,

59
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:02.800
you actually see it blowing up within the spiral alarm where it was.

60
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.290
<v 0>So most stars are born inspire alarms cause that's where all the gas and the</v>

61
00:03:07.291 --> 00:03:10.170
energy and all the, all the stuff's kicking off, but they don't stay there.

62
00:03:10.171 --> 00:03:14.220
It's not like as the arms swirling around the galaxy, the stars go with them.

63
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.190
<v 1>No, you should think of spiral, arms as light waves,</v>

64
00:03:17.191 --> 00:03:20.220
which are traveling around the galaxy and they travel around the galaxy at their

65
00:03:20.221 --> 00:03:22.620
speed and the stars travel around the galaxy at their speed.

66
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.110
And they're not the same in most parts of the galaxy. In fact,

67
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.220
for most of the galaxy,

68
00:03:26.221 --> 00:03:29.760
the stars and the guests that make up the galaxy travel faster than the spiral

69
00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:30.594
arms.

70
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.460
And so the way that stars form is that a gas cloud will travel traveling faster

71
00:03:35.461 --> 00:03:37.890
than the spiral arm will sort of catch up with it and overtake it.

72
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.960
But as it passes through the spiral alarm,

73
00:03:39.961 --> 00:03:42.600
it gets compressed by the density wave of the spiral alarm.

74
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.270
And that compression is what triggers the star formation.

75
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.810
And then the hour after the stars are formed the star,

76
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.110
as massive as the supernova, hadn't had time to travel very far.

77
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.780
It sort of started traveling towards the front edge of the spiral alarm,

78
00:03:54.781 --> 00:03:55.920
but it won't have got very far.

79
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.380
And so you'll still see it in the spiral alarm when it blows up.

80
00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:59.311
<v 0>Okay.</v>

81
00:03:59.311 --> 00:04:04.290
So it's almost like all the gas is being lit up by the arms as the arms

82
00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:09.030
move around and stars form when they light up and then the stars will move at

83
00:04:09.031 --> 00:04:11.130
the speeds that the gas was moving at,

84
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.620
not the speed that the waves were moving out.

85
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.520
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

86
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.150
So the stars will continue if it was a slightly less massive star that wasn't

87
00:04:18.151 --> 00:04:20.400
destined to explode shortly after forming,

88
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.400
it would continue and continue moving away from the front edge of the spiral

89
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.523
alarm as it travels fast.

90
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.640
<v 0>Okay. So the sun, for example, moves in and out of spiral alarms,</v>

91
00:04:29.641 --> 00:04:33.420
as it merrily goes around the Milky way, which it's done a few times already,

92
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.673
you know, the sun.

93
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.520
<v 1>You know,</v>

94
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.580
it takes about what a couple of hundred million years to travel around the Milky

95
00:04:38.581 --> 00:04:40.110
way. And it's been around for billions of years.

96
00:04:40.111 --> 00:04:42.600
So it's gone round the Milky way, tens of times since. Yeah.

97
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.850
<v 0>But this poor one and M 61, it didn't get far. It hardly got off the ground. No.</v>

98
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.880
<v 1>It really wasn't. As you know, it's, it's soon as it was born,</v>

99
00:04:50.881 --> 00:04:53.340
basically it blew up at least in sort of Stella terms.

100
00:04:53.341 --> 00:04:55.380
And so actually it really didn't have very much time.

101
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.860
<v 0>When you travel anywhere. Is the sun currently in or out of a spiral alarm?</v>

102
00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.880
I think.

103
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.320
<v 1>Between at the moment, that's not, uh,</v>

104
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.540
not in a particularly exciting part of the Milky way.

105
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.730
<v 0>Will we be able to go back into the archive of pictures of M 61 and</v>

106
00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:12.120
find the star that blue, like say that was the one that's where it was.

107
00:05:12.121 --> 00:05:14.640
That was the one that was just about to go and learn anything from that.

108
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.630
I don't know.

109
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.321
<v 1>This particular case,</v>

110
00:05:16.321 --> 00:05:19.200
but it is something that people are doing more and more often now. Um,

111
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.140
with Hubble space, telescope image quality,

112
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.760
you can actually see the very bright stars that go supernovae as individual

113
00:05:26.761 --> 00:05:27.900
stars before they blew up.

114
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.740
So if there happens to be a picture of the right part of M 61,

115
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.750
then it will be possible to go back. And in fact,

116
00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:37.680
this is one of the ways we learn about the supernova process is by looking at

117
00:05:37.681 --> 00:05:39.060
these progenitors, these stars,

118
00:05:39.061 --> 00:05:43.620
which are going to blow and learning what kind of star it is that that is just,

119
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.350
just before it blows up, how it looks just before it explodes.

120
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.010
<v 0>Would we be able to go back afterwards when all the light dies down and find the</v>

121
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.280
remnant? See what's left behind probably.

122
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.780
<v 1>Not in this case. Cause it's almost certainly too faint.</v>

123
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.910
I mean it for supernova 1980 a and the large measure Atlantic cloud.

124
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.230
So very much closer there with really good imaging from Apple space telescope,

125
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:07.070
we've been able to start studying the remnant that formed behind the explosion.

126
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.860
Um, but this is just so much further away.

127
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:12.740
I very much doubt we'll be able to see anything once the supernova itself has

128
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:13.690
failed.

129
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.810
<v 0>Now, because this has happened during the pandemic lockdown,</v>

130
00:06:16.811 --> 00:06:18.820
I was all excited because this was, you know,

131
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.980
I was going to call this the Corona supernova,

132
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.390
but you've sent me straight a bit.

133
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.510
And apparently these are not particularly rare events.

134
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:26.950
These things are banging all the time.

135
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.540
<v 1>They really are. And because,</v>

136
00:06:28.541 --> 00:06:32.350
so this one was discovered with a telescope called the Zwicky transient

137
00:06:32.351 --> 00:06:35.740
facility, which is actually out scanning the skies the entire time.

138
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.590
It covers the entire Northern sky every few nights.

139
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.210
So it was collecting huge amounts of data and we'll find pretty much all the

140
00:06:43.211 --> 00:06:47.470
supernovae that go off sort of within its range. Um, and so that actually,

141
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.480
when it used to be the case, we'd find, you know,

142
00:06:49.481 --> 00:06:52.060
maybe a dozen or so supernovae a year. Um,

143
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.280
but now with all these automated searches out there,

144
00:06:54.281 --> 00:06:57.670
we're finding literally thousands of supernovae and we've actually had to change

145
00:06:57.671 --> 00:07:01.330
the way we named supernovae a bit to make this fit in that, for example,

146
00:07:01.331 --> 00:07:04.780
supernova 1987, eight, it was called that because it was found in 1987,

147
00:07:04.781 --> 00:07:06.400
it was the first one in 1987.

148
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.530
And we used to just work our way through the alphabet.

149
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.770
And then it turned out that actually you, you run out letters of the alphabet.

150
00:07:11.771 --> 00:07:13.420
So then we went into using two letters.

151
00:07:13.421 --> 00:07:16.990
So once you've used all the single letters, then you'd have AA, BAC and so on,

152
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.950
but it turns out now we're finding so many supernovae that even two letters

153
00:07:20.951 --> 00:07:25.180
aren't enough. So now, now we have to go through three sets of the alphabet.

154
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:30.160
And so this for example was supernova 2020 GAF O um, and I'm sure,

155
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.730
uh, the next few supernovae you've already been found since then.

156
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.660
So actually we sort of it's that the meter's clocking up very quickly on the

157
00:07:37.661 --> 00:07:38.494
names of supernovae.

158
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:39.783
<v 0>Is it possible?</v>

159
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.500
Is it ever happened that someone is looking at a galaxy and the supernova goes

160
00:07:44.501 --> 00:07:46.630
off? Like you see the moment it blinks into existence.

161
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:48.850
<v 1>You'd have to be very lucky,</v>

162
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.630
but actually there are an awful lot of astronomers out there staring at the sky.

163
00:07:52.631 --> 00:07:55.150
So sooner or later you'd think it probably will happen. Yeah.

164
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.420
<v 0>That'd be awesome. You should, you should be out there doing that.</v>

165
00:07:58.421 --> 00:08:00.940
Just watch am. 61 is a good candidate.

166
00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:03.070
You're telling me that's a bit of a hotbed for supernovas.

167
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.330
<v 1>Yeah, it is because, although, so typically you expect an, uh, a galaxy,</v>

168
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.070
you know, like the Milky way or M 61,

169
00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:13.150
you expect maybe one supernova every 50 years, but actually this one has had,

170
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.810
you know, it had one. So it's had one this year, there was another one in 2014,

171
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.620
or at least another couple since 2000. So this one is a real,

172
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.040
real supernova factory at the moment. No one, I think really understands why,

173
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.890
why one galaxy was suddenly produce a whole bunch of supernovae.

174
00:08:26.891 --> 00:08:29.680
I think it really just didn't give them the very short timescale involved.

175
00:08:29.681 --> 00:08:33.130
It has to be just down to chance. Um, but yeah, if you were well,

176
00:08:33.131 --> 00:08:35.200
it depends which way you look at it, right? Maybe you say, well,

177
00:08:35.201 --> 00:08:38.110
M 61 has had its fair share now. So you want to go and look somewhere else, but,

178
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:40.690
or maybe you want to say, well, you know, M 60 is on a roll.

179
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.070
So maybe we should just keep looking there.

180
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:47.560
<v 0>If a supernova went off in aspire alarm and you were in the same</v>

181
00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:50.980
spiral arm, that'd be pretty, that'd be a good site. Wouldn't it?

182
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.910
<v 1>It would be pretty impressive. So you remember a little while ago, I'll go,</v>

183
00:08:54.911 --> 00:08:58.200
there was a lot of excitement about maybe build use was going to go. Um,

184
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.840
and there you'd have had a supernova that you'd have been able to see during

185
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:05.400
daytime from the earth, um, which is a relatively nearby star to us.

186
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:08.040
So yeah, indeed. If you were in the right spiral arm in M 61,

187
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:10.080
you'd be getting a bit of a show at the moment. Yeah.

188
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:12.590
<v 0>Yeah. But you'd be safe. As long as that wasn't your star.</v>

189
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.600
You want to be a reasonable.

190
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.220
<v 1>Distance away. Cause there are gamma rays and nasty things, but,</v>

191
00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.910
but as soon as you get, you know, unless it really is a nearby neighbor,

192
00:09:19.911 --> 00:09:20.744
you're probably fine.

193
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.710
<v 0>Are you going to keep imaging this and watch it brighten up and fade away?</v>

194
00:09:24.711 --> 00:09:27.050
Or have you got a bit bored with this one now and you're moving on.

195
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.240
<v 1>I'm going to try it. So this one was called really early.</v>

196
00:09:29.241 --> 00:09:30.470
I think it's still brightening up.

197
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.040
So it'll be interesting to map out his light curve to see how it's light changes

198
00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:34.910
over the coming weeks.

199
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.490
Although I think I'm going to be slightly in the mercy of the weather,

200
00:09:37.491 --> 00:09:40.010
in that the forecast looks cloudy for at least the next week.

201
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.950
<v 0>Pretty lucky to get this one. They weren't. And you were showing me,</v>

202
00:09:42.951 --> 00:09:45.560
you had to like thread the needle between the trees and the house.

203
00:09:45.561 --> 00:09:47.600
And that that's where it is at the sky and things. Yeah.

204
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.700
<v 1>It was a tiny little patch of sky. I could. Amen.</v>

205
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:53.360
So it was M 61 is kind of in the South from here. Um,

206
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.720
and so the South is the direction of my house from the back garden,

207
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.600
which means that actually, unless it's quite high in the South,

208
00:09:59.601 --> 00:10:01.670
you end up looking at my house rather than the object,

209
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:05.300
but it turns out there's a tiny little patch in my garden where you can just set

210
00:10:05.301 --> 00:10:07.580
up the telescope and see it and sort of next to the chimney bot.

211
00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:12.080
And I got lucky and actually really lucky in that the clouds cleared it just the

212
00:10:12.081 --> 00:10:14.390
right moment for me actually, to be able to capture an image of it.

213
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:17.810
<v 0>You'll be able to get like an occultation with the chimney park.</v>

214
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.160
<v 1>I did. Well, I have actually had things disappear.</v>

215
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.230
I thought I wonder where that's gone and it's because the telescopes tracked in

216
00:10:24.231 --> 00:10:25.690
such a way that the house has got in the way.

217
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:29.450
<v 0>Oh, you think you've found this amazing supernova and it's your office window or</v>

218
00:10:29.451 --> 00:10:30.770
something. Yeah.

219
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.950
<v 1>Well you got to be careful when you start pointing your telescope into bedroom</v>

220
00:10:33.951 --> 00:10:34.784
windows though.

221
00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:39.260
Spiral structure is that when you calculate the procession speed of all these

222
00:10:39.261 --> 00:10:41.270
orbits, you find that they're all the same.

223
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.310
That's how spiral will start to get to generated.

224
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.430
It's in the case where you can have all those ellipses processing at the same

225
00:10:46.431 --> 00:10:48.110
speed and that procession. So if you can think about it,

226
00:10:48.111 --> 00:10:50.810
you can think about the stars going around and then the ellipse itself is

227
00:10:50.811 --> 00:10:54.500
rotating. I've seen I've sold the squeak by the way, you know,

228
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.270
I sold the squeak WD 40, no,

229
00:10:59.271 --> 00:11:01.610
I just crank the seat of the chair back. So I can't lean back there.
