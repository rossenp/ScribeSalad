1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.950
<v 0>This is not because I don't enjoy lecturing.</v>

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.000
I love lecturing and I get a great deal out of the experience.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.060
And I see my role in lecturing to enthuse students,

4
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.610
but in terms of active learning,

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.080
just sitting there for 50 minutes for one thing, why 50 minutes?

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.270
Why, why do we stop people in here for an hour or 50 minutes to an hour?

7
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.130
Why that quantum of time.

8
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.290
<v 1>All right, professor, where are you standing at the moment.</v>

9
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.160
<v 0>I'm standing in the largest lecture theater in the physics building and actually</v>

10
00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:34.010
one of the largest lecture theaters of the university of Nottingham.

11
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.100
What we're going to talk about today is the depth of the lecture we're in the

12
00:00:37.101 --> 00:00:41.660
midst of a pandemic and higher education and lecturing is going to be

13
00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:44.870
changed or is in the process of being changed dramatically.

14
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.910
There's a wonderful quote from Virginia Wolfe.

15
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.130
University lectures are an obsolete practice inherited from the middle ages.

16
00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:56.450
When books were scarce to swallow instruction from a lectern is like sipping

17
00:00:56.451 --> 00:01:00.530
through a straw lectures, ponder to the vanity of the lecturer.

18
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.040
Do you agree with that? I do. I agree entirely with that.

19
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.800
<v 1>Uh, lectures dead. Should they be dead?</v>

20
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.163
<v 2>Definitely not.</v>

21
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.170
I guess it's been given a particular currency because of locked down and the

22
00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:14.660
fact that we haven't actually been able to give lectures and the fact that we

23
00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:17.480
actually finished up our teaching for this academic year online,

24
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.300
but actually the discussions been going on a lot longer than that.

25
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.130
And what's really precipitated.

26
00:01:22.131 --> 00:01:25.880
It was the prevalence of lecture capture.

27
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:27.260
The fact that lecture capture is happening,

28
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.440
that we're basically videoing and recording all our lectures and making them

29
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:33.950
available to students. And so then the obvious question you ask is, well,

30
00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:35.690
what was the point in being at the lecture? You know,

31
00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:38.660
why don't I just listen to the lecture capture? Um,

32
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.070
and certainly my view is that they are not in any way interchangeable.

33
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.350
<v 0>I think it is ridiculous that process whereby we just stuffed students into a</v>

34
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:49.970
lecture theater and talk about them.

35
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.760
We've been doing that for centuries and it's really easy.

36
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.420
It's really easy for a lecture just to stand up here and talk. Particularly,

37
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.700
all you're doing is effectively taking notes from a book,

38
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.020
firing them out and expecting the students to absorb that by osmosis.

39
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.480
How do you really deeply learn something?

40
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.740
Do you sit and just watch somebody talk at you and listen to it,

41
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.040
or do you actively engage with it? So for example, at the moment,

42
00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:15.290
what I'm trying to do is use,

43
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.750
try to do something called triplets on drums, which is basically dat dat, dat,

44
00:02:19.751 --> 00:02:22.280
dat, dat dat, just three drums in a roll.

45
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.410
Now I can watch as many videos as I like explaining this is

46
00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:29.450
how you do triplets or what a triplet is.

47
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.050
I'm not going to get any further in terms of engaging with that material or any

48
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:33.980
musical instrument,

49
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.220
anything you can think of in terms of how do you learn to play an instrument?

50
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.360
You practice, you engage with the material and you do something active.

51
00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:45.710
So you burn it into your neurons. That's not what's happening in a lecture.

52
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.350
<v 2>If you go to a lecture, you know, if there's a nine o'clock nature,</v>

53
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.300
you've made a particular effort to be there.

54
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.560
You've kind of committed to going there. You're sitting there for an hour.

55
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.060
There are no other distractions.

56
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.470
You're surrounded by a whole bunch of other students who are all focused on

57
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:02.380
what's going on in the lecture. So I actually, you know,

58
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.880
it really kind of is going to be a completely different experience from watching

59
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:10.120
a YouTube video while you're doing three other things at the same time,

60
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:13.150
making yourself a cheese toasty and chatting to your mates.

61
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.710
You talk about the fact that students that are lecture, pay attention more.

62
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.230
Do they pay attention though? Are they just turning up?

63
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:23.920
Because they have to be ticked off a list? I mean, they don't have to be there,

64
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:26.650
right. And you know, nothing bad happens to them. If they don't turn up,

65
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.810
we'll ask why they weren't there. But actually, you know,

66
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:31.570
we don't kick them out of the university or anything like that. It really is.

67
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.901
I mean, you know,

68
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:34.630
you just want a little bit of pressure to get people to go to the lecture.

69
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:37.540
Then they bother to attend and they get all the benefits that come from actually

70
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:38.374
being in the lab.

71
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.360
<v 0>There's a wonderful lecturer in Harvard physicist called Eric Missoura.</v>

72
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.980
It's got this wonderful quote,

73
00:03:43.981 --> 00:03:48.900
which is the traditional lecture involves transferring the notes from the

74
00:03:48.901 --> 00:03:50.340
notebook of the lecturer,

75
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.480
to the notebooks of the students without going through the brains of either.

76
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.270
And that may be overstating the case a little bit,

77
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.480
but it's not overstating the case a lot. And again,

78
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.470
I see my role really about enthusing. It's about getting the students to say,

79
00:04:04.471 --> 00:04:08.520
well, this is interesting work. This is a really interesting subject.

80
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.800
I want to find out more about this.

81
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.770
I want to do the coursework because the subject is interesting.

82
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.120
I want to understand this more,

83
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.290
but the intellectual heavy lifting doesn't come from me or shouldn't come from

84
00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:23.130
me. It comes from the students and that's not what's happening in this type of

85
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.503
environment.

86
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.630
<v 2>Really important when you're learning that there's a reasonable amount of</v>

87
00:04:27.631 --> 00:04:29.490
structure imposed on what you're doing,

88
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.140
that you're learning things in the right order,

89
00:04:31.141 --> 00:04:34.500
that you're learning them from the right resources in a consistent way that

90
00:04:34.501 --> 00:04:36.600
everything sort of fits together with everything else.

91
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.040
And the nice thing about the structure of a lecture is that that's sort of built

92
00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:44.580
into it, right? That actually the lecture has all that has that flow to it.

93
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.700
It's sort of done in a very sort of consistent way.

94
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.420
Whereas if you're just dipping into, you know, this resource and that resource,

95
00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:54.000
it's very hard to get that kind of structured learning,

96
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.640
which is an important part of the learning process.

97
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.630
<v 0>Making sure that students focus within this environment and that something to</v>

98
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.180
get, you know, we've got a nine o'clock lecture I'll get off-road,

99
00:05:03.181 --> 00:05:06.030
I won't get awkward, but at least a structure there that is important.

100
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.020
But to me it seems like a real cop-out to say that while all we're doing is

101
00:05:10.021 --> 00:05:13.920
structuring the material, we can do so much more without 50 minutes,

102
00:05:13.921 --> 00:05:15.300
rather than just have the traditional.

103
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.450
<v 2>Sure. We have some levels of interaction. You know, we have,</v>

104
00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:21.930
we give the students these little clickers that allow them to answer questions

105
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.330
during the course of the lecture. So there is sort of,

106
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.870
even in a large lecture with 200 students in it, I am getting that feedback.

107
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.940
Did that thing I just explained go across, right?

108
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.040
Or have I failed to explain it miserably?

109
00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:35.580
In which case they're not going to be able to answer the simple multiple choice

110
00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:36.660
question I've just asked them.

111
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.600
So there is lots of places where there is interaction,

112
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.250
even in the conventional lecture.

113
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.950
<v 0>The lecture in its current format.</v>

114
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.850
I would say we really do anything to need to think about the death of that.

115
00:05:47.851 --> 00:05:51.060
But of course, we're not going to throw the baby out with the bath water.

116
00:05:51.061 --> 00:05:52.230
So what we will do,

117
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.270
and I think it's sort of obvious the grand term that's being used is chunking,

118
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.340
which seems really strange. Cause you've been chunking for years.

119
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.460
Brady you've been breaking material open to five and 10 minute videos.

120
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.090
That's what we should do. Short five, 10 minutes, 60 symbols,

121
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:12.650
like videos on a particular topic accompanied with, for example, a simulation,

122
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:14.230
a piece of Java script or whatever that,

123
00:06:14.231 --> 00:06:18.800
that code some of that with parameters and that can be adjusted and

124
00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:23.420
changed so that students can effectively do a numerical experiment and

125
00:06:23.421 --> 00:06:25.910
say, well, if he's talking about this, about you adjust these sliders,

126
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:26.744
what happens?

127
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.900
And that interactivity is important again in terms of getting the concepts.

128
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.510
And then we use the lecture slots,

129
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:35.300
whatever lecture slots we have as available as problems, classes,

130
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.830
and as discussion groups. And I'll set up some, here are some problems.

131
00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:42.050
And what we're going to do is we're going to discuss those problems.

132
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.080
Now you can say, well, what are the students? Don't do the problems. Well,

133
00:06:45.081 --> 00:06:49.250
what we do is we have some credit associated.

134
00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:53.660
We have some marks associated with the coursework to encourage them gently to do

135
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:55.430
the work and to engage with the work that's.

136
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.090
<v 2>There's this thing called the flipped classroom,</v>

137
00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.520
which is the idea is that basically in the classroom,

138
00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:04.090
instead of the lecturer standing up and teaching things, the students have,

139
00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:05.560
pre-read a bunch of stuff.

140
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.800
And then basically you get them to solve problems in the class.

141
00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:10.180
You get them to interact with you,

142
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.450
to interact with each other and get much more of a dialogue going.

143
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.130
It's a nice idea in principle, uh, it worked, it clearly works to a degree,

144
00:07:18.131 --> 00:07:21.850
but actually there is interesting evidence that suggests it's not quite the

145
00:07:21.851 --> 00:07:24.400
golden bullet that some people have been arguing that it is.

146
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.460
There was a test done last year, uh,

147
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.550
by some researchers at MIT where they did the controlled experiment.

148
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.680
If some people being taught in a flipped classroom way,

149
00:07:32.681 --> 00:07:34.420
some people were being taught in the conventional way.

150
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.230
They found that the overall attainment was about the same in both groups,

151
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.000
but actually the flip classroom group,

152
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.140
the spread of attainment was much bigger in that the better students really

153
00:07:44.141 --> 00:07:46.480
enjoyed it and got a lot out of it and did better.

154
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.140
But the weakest students really struggled with it. And for example,

155
00:07:50.141 --> 00:07:53.710
students from minority groups found it very hard. And in retrospect,

156
00:07:53.711 --> 00:07:55.810
I think there are kind of obvious reasons for that, right?

157
00:07:55.811 --> 00:08:00.010
That actually you would expect that if you're a slightly disenfranchised group,

158
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.580
if you come up with a way of teaching that really requires you to interact

159
00:08:03.581 --> 00:08:07.360
effectively with the other students, then you're going to find it harder to do.

160
00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:07.930
If you're,

161
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:11.020
they're not your natural social peer group that you've been interacting with.

162
00:08:11.021 --> 00:08:12.910
Anyway. So I think, you know,

163
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.120
part of the argument against the traditional lecture is that there are new or

164
00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:19.360
better ways of doing it. I would just caution that those newer,

165
00:08:19.361 --> 00:08:22.420
better ways sometimes have some, some shortcomings of their own.

166
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.670
<v 0>This comes home to me, I've had tutorial groups.</v>

167
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:29.170
What's absolutely clear that one of the students in that group is absolutely

168
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:34.000
uncomfortable with being in that small group and being sort of on the edge of

169
00:08:34.001 --> 00:08:34.570
their seat.

170
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:38.470
Maybe I'm going to get asked a question and I don't know this and what are the

171
00:08:38.471 --> 00:08:39.400
others going to think of me?

172
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.000
So what we have to do is just recognize that there are different ways of

173
00:08:43.001 --> 00:08:44.260
learning other students. For example,

174
00:08:44.261 --> 00:08:48.130
in a tutorial group are rushing to the board to do things, but some aren't.

175
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.010
So we have to have a blended approach to learning.

176
00:08:51.011 --> 00:08:55.260
It's sort of obvious in some ways, but again, just stuffing,

177
00:08:55.261 --> 00:08:58.080
lots of people in here and talking at them is not the way to do it.

178
00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:00.560
<v 3>I've heard you're a good lecture. Do you not?</v>

179
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.920
Do you not think they've added something unique to people's university

180
00:09:03.921 --> 00:09:06.350
experience into their education sitting in your lecture.

181
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.720
<v 0>If I've enthused people? Yes,</v>

182
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.680
but I want them to come away from this not going well. I listened to that.

183
00:09:12.681 --> 00:09:14.420
That was amazing. I've learned a lot.

184
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.480
I want them to come away with a going I've listened to that.

185
00:09:17.481 --> 00:09:18.890
That was really amazing and interesting.

186
00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:23.030
And then he was very enthusiastic about it. I want to learn more.

187
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.600
That's the key thing and which is exciting.

188
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.470
<v 2>It depends on the lecturer. It's interesting, right? Some of my colleagues,</v>

189
00:09:30.471 --> 00:09:30.621
you know,

190
00:09:30.621 --> 00:09:34.250
sometimes they end up with what looked like deadly dull subjects to lecture,

191
00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.590
but they find exciting ways to present them.

192
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.140
Others sometimes look like they've got the most exciting,

193
00:09:39.141 --> 00:09:40.550
optional thing that will, you know,

194
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.310
tell people about cutting edge research in some area or other.

195
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.270
And they managed to sound it, make it sound deadly, dull. Um,

196
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.060
so it is a bit varied.

197
00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:54.200
I just don't think you improve that situation dramatically by just changing the

198
00:09:54.201 --> 00:09:55.400
medium you're using for teaching.

199
00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:00.050
<v 3>Phil. I know that you really love music are your best music experience.</v>

200
00:10:00.051 --> 00:10:04.730
The times when you've listened to songs at home on your own chunks of music and

201
00:10:04.731 --> 00:10:05.331
things like that,

202
00:10:05.331 --> 00:10:08.450
or has it been when you've been at concerts with thousands of other people,

203
00:10:08.451 --> 00:10:09.350
seeing them in the flesh?

204
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.320
<v 0>Brilliant, absolutely brilliant point. Brilliant. Yes.</v>

205
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.400
That collective communal experience sort of, it is very, very important.

206
00:10:16.401 --> 00:10:18.680
And that interaction between the students is very important.

207
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.560
I am not suggesting that we get rid of that.

208
00:10:21.561 --> 00:10:24.110
I'm suggesting that what we do is we amplify that,

209
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.250
get them talking to each other during the lectures, get them arguing with me.

210
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.911
So finally,

211
00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:31.520
a module I do called the politics perception of philosophy of physics,

212
00:10:31.521 --> 00:10:35.090
which I think I've mentioned before the first time I did that because it's quite

213
00:10:35.091 --> 00:10:35.421
different.

214
00:10:35.421 --> 00:10:39.020
It's more like a humanity setup in that there are seminars and discussion

215
00:10:39.021 --> 00:10:41.480
groups. So I'll talk for 20 minutes and then open up the floor.

216
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.490
I expected it to be tumbleweed.

217
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.810
These are physicists after all what traditional physics courses,

218
00:10:47.811 --> 00:10:48.740
you just talk at them,

219
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.700
but the flood Gates opened and they debated and they discussed and they argued

220
00:10:52.701 --> 00:10:55.430
in a friendly way. And sometimes yeah, no, usually in a friendly way.

221
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:58.910
And they argued with me as well. And that's what I want.

222
00:10:58.970 --> 00:10:59.900
That's what should happen.

223
00:10:59.901 --> 00:11:04.790
That's so much better than me statically sort of

224
00:11:04.791 --> 00:11:06.440
given that, that information.

225
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:08.600
<v 3>What do you say to someone who says, well,</v>

226
00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:12.200
Mike's the head of school at a university physics department. Of course,

227
00:11:12.201 --> 00:11:14.210
he's going to advocate for something that, you know,

228
00:11:14.211 --> 00:11:15.980
you can only get at a university.

229
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.690
<v 2>Um, is that true statement? I guess that is a true statement. I mean,</v>

230
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:26.090
it's true to an extent, uh, and there are people who are perfectly, you know,

231
00:11:26.091 --> 00:11:29.240
autodidacts who can go out and really learn these things on their own.

232
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:34.190
I think probably the learning process intrinsically requires somebody to be

233
00:11:34.191 --> 00:11:35.090
guiding you through it.

234
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.360
And wherever that guidance comes from a lecturer standing at the front of a

235
00:11:38.361 --> 00:11:42.750
lecture theater or a tutor you're chatting with about your problems, trying to,

236
00:11:42.751 --> 00:11:45.800
to understand a particular area of the subject, you know,

237
00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:49.040
there will be different ways that guidance is given.

238
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:53.090
The lecture is just one of the ways that that guidance has given education.

239
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.610
Difficult lecturing.

240
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:59.200
<v 0>Is easy. Some will disagree, but that's certainly my perspective on this.</v>

241
00:11:59.201 --> 00:12:02.350
I'm sure I hope this will generate some debate there.

242
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:04.630
I hope that common section or light up,

243
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:09.580
but I would argue that lecturing is easy. Education is difficult.

244
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.320
For example, we lecturers have,

245
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.980
are much easier job than secondary school teachers, high school teachers,

246
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:16.570
much easier job.

247
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:21.180
<v 3>What about the heritage? Einstein gave lectures. This is a wonderful thing.</v>

248
00:12:21.181 --> 00:12:22.320
That's happened for so many years.

249
00:12:22.321 --> 00:12:24.570
And now you want to have zoom calls and quizzes.

250
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:26.130
<v 0>Einstein didn't have an iPhone.</v>

251
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:30.540
So Einstein didn't, um,

252
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.020
communicate with people on the other side of the world, almost instantaneously,

253
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.020
Einstein lived in a different world and the physicist who Einstein

254
00:12:40.021 --> 00:12:43.740
was teaching and the physicist that who were interacting with Einstein,

255
00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.900
it was a very different time.

256
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:50.340
And the skills that you needed then are very different from the skills you need

257
00:12:50.341 --> 00:12:51.174
today.

258
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.960
<v 3>Having made the case for lectures and talking about how valuable you think they</v>

259
00:12:54.961 --> 00:12:56.130
are to education.

260
00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.460
We're recording this during a pandemic where it looks like you're not going to

261
00:12:59.461 --> 00:13:02.830
be able to give them for who knows how long, how catastrophic is.

262
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:08.130
<v 2>The process has been nonstop in that we moved all of our teaching very rapidly</v>

263
00:13:08.131 --> 00:13:10.740
online in a very ad hoc fashion. When it all started,

264
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.470
we then got into assessment, how do we do exams?

265
00:13:13.471 --> 00:13:16.650
We figured out ways of doing that. We've just completed the assessment.

266
00:13:16.651 --> 00:13:18.630
We've just been returning the students, their marks.

267
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.660
The next thing on the list is, okay, so that's done now.

268
00:13:21.661 --> 00:13:24.450
How do we teach it better next year? So we're already,

269
00:13:24.451 --> 00:13:29.280
I was in a Skype meeting yesterday where we were discussing new methods for

270
00:13:29.281 --> 00:13:32.790
teaching what technology we're going to use, what approaches we're going to use,

271
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.340
how are we going to split things up into smaller pieces?

272
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.380
How are we going to assure that there are, you know,

273
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.590
Q and a sessions with lecturers and ways for them to engage with the lecturer.

274
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.940
We're only working our way through that. Now, hopefully, you know,

275
00:13:44.941 --> 00:13:47.820
this is not the longterm where we're going to be forever.

276
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.420
And so we're trying to develop things in a way that sort of blended that allows

277
00:13:51.421 --> 00:13:55.140
us to combine face-to-face things with online things so that we can shift the

278
00:13:55.141 --> 00:13:57.810
balance as times allow. Um,

279
00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.120
but we're really just feeling our way through it at the moment.

280
00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:03.300
<v 3>Would anything be lost by the death of the lecture?</v>

281
00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:08.200
<v 0>No. I don't think the depth of the traditional lecture format. No, I don't.</v>

282
00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:11.400
I don't think we will have the same elements. Um,

283
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.110
we will have the ability to have a lecturer who's there as hopefully

284
00:14:16.111 --> 00:14:19.110
engaging is hopefully explaining the material,

285
00:14:19.111 --> 00:14:23.850
but in a much more interactive way in terms of being led by the students,

286
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:25.260
rather than just going well,

287
00:14:25.261 --> 00:14:27.720
I'll prepare my lecture notes the night before and just dumped them at the

288
00:14:27.721 --> 00:14:28.500
students.

289
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.620
<v 3>Who's going to win this. We're already seeing some universities saying, Oh,</v>

290
00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:33.720
we're going to go online next year. And things like that.

291
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.580
Are you going to end up being right here?

292
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:40.350
<v 0>I think that in terms of how we modify the lectures, yes.</v>

293
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.080
I would say it's not just, I've got to point out. It's not just me.

294
00:14:43.081 --> 00:14:46.380
There were many other people who think along these lines, I think, yes,

295
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.340
we're going to see a change.

296
00:14:47.341 --> 00:14:51.030
And I think the important thing is it's stuff that would have, you know,

297
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.560
two years ago would have said, if I want to do things this way,

298
00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:56.480
the argument would have been well, just we don't have the resources to do that.

299
00:14:56.481 --> 00:14:57.500
There's no way we can do that.

300
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.620
It's really interesting how this pandemic has focused on mind and things that

301
00:15:00.621 --> 00:15:05.120
would have previously been absolutely beyond the pill suddenly are within reach

302
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.910
with this current pandemic. I think common idea of the side of it.

303
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.840
And during it, we got an opportunity really to radically change things.

304
00:15:11.841 --> 00:15:16.460
And I would be so disappointed if we come out the other side of this and all

305
00:15:16.461 --> 00:15:17.211
that happens is, well,

306
00:15:17.211 --> 00:15:20.810
I've got a slightly higher resolution camera to fill my traditional lectures.

307
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:22.340
That will be so disappointing.

308
00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:26.440
<v 3>If you'd like to see both of the full length interviews that went into this</v>

309
00:15:26.441 --> 00:15:27.274
video,

310
00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.610
I'm going to put the links on the screen and down in the video description.

311
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:34.930
I also think there's like a little bit of star power in a strange way to being

312
00:15:34.931 --> 00:15:38.680
taught in person by a person who does the thing and knows the stuff.

313
00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:40.990
Even if it's a lowly astronomer thing,

314
00:15:40.991 --> 00:15:44.710
topic being taught astronomy by someone who's been there and done it and done

315
00:15:44.711 --> 00:15:48.670
real astronomy and written papers and use the big telescopes has like a kind of

316
00:15:48.671 --> 00:15:51.580
a, a star quality. If you excuse the pattern.

317
00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.710
<v 2>And also it means that, you know,</v>

318
00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.860
when they come up with questions at the end that weren't on the syllabus,

319
00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.560
hopefully it means the lecturer can actually answer them because, you know,

320
00:15:59.561 --> 00:16:01.000
they actually know the subject they had.

321
00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.220
They don't just know the thing that they're teaching.

322
00:16:03.221 --> 00:16:04.810
They don't just know the syllabus they're teaching.

323
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:06.880
They actually know the subject around them.

324
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.450
<v 3>You can see plenty more videos too, with Mike and Phil,</v>
