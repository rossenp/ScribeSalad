1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.830
<v 0>All right, professor, what are you, what are you,</v>

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:02.820
what are we talking about today?

3
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.100
<v 1>I was going to talk about a paper entitled Gaya,</v>

4
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.600
early data released three acceleration of the solar system from Gaia, Austria.

5
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.980
<v 0>Professor. You are loving all these findings that are coming out of Gaia, right?</v>

6
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.840
<v 1>It's a brilliant mission. And, and actually, you know,</v>

7
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.870
I think the best is yet to come because it's the nature of this telescope.

8
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.580
Its sole ambition is to measure the positions of about a billion

9
00:00:25.581 --> 00:00:30.110
stars and various other objects in space and to continue to monitor them.

10
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.090
And the primary science goal is to measure this phenomenon called parallax,

11
00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:38.060
which is basically as the satellite, as it's orbiting the earth,

12
00:00:38.061 --> 00:00:39.140
the earth goes around the sun,

13
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.370
which means it's sort of viewing the nearby universe from different places and

14
00:00:43.371 --> 00:00:46.190
in doing so it's viewing things from slightly different directions.

15
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.510
You end up seeing the stars,

16
00:00:47.511 --> 00:00:50.150
move a little bit and the classic way of illustrating this is this the same

17
00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:50.601
phenomenon.

18
00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:53.540
If you hold your finger up in front of your nose and then close one eye and

19
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:55.340
close the other eye and your finger jumps,

20
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.520
just because your eyes are viewing it from slightly different directions and the

21
00:00:58.521 --> 00:01:01.400
further your finger is away from your face, the less your finger jumps.

22
00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:03.350
When you make that, do that in the library.

23
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.340
<v 0>Professor, this might say something about me, but I remember like, you know,</v>

24
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.660
when Hubble went up and talk about James Webb and there's so much hype and

25
00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:14.690
excitement, I feel like I don't even remember guy going up.

26
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.330
I don't remember people talking about it.

27
00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:19.760
It just kind of one day you started telling me, look at all this amazing data.

28
00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:20.990
And I'm like, where does this come from?

29
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.130
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

30
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.460
<v 1>I guess it's partly because it's a little bit more specialized and astrometry,</v>

31
00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:33.230
you know, it's a, it's a classic subject.

32
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.110
And for the longest time it may very little progress.

33
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.110
But then we first had this mission called the park costs in the 1990s.

34
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:41.030
And then Gaia is kind of the successes of that,

35
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.420
which have kind of completely revolutionized what these telescopes could do.

36
00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:45.560
The accuracy of the missions.

37
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.270
<v 0>What's this paper telling us.</v>

38
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.890
<v 1>So we need to back up a little bit first. Um, am I need to talk about, uh, uh,</v>

39
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.300
a bit of astronomy called stellar aberration. It sort of came with the birth of,

40
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.990
of, uh, people trying to measure parallax. So back in the 18th century,

41
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:02.630
there was a guy called Bradley. James Bradley was his name.

42
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.720
There was trying to measure the distances to stars from this parallax effect.

43
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.230
And what he actually found is that the stars do indeed move over the course of a

44
00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:13.610
year, but in completely the wrong pattern for it to be the parallax effect.

45
00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:15.200
And by far too large and amount.

46
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.560
And what he did uncovered was this phenomenon called stellar aberration.

47
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.870
And he was actually also the person, not only who discovered it,

48
00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:23.060
but also came up with the explanations to what's going on.

49
00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:26.570
Why stars wobble around over the course of the year. And in essence,

50
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.970
it comes down to, if you think about going out in the rain,

51
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.880
like if there were an, imagine the rains falling straight down on your head,

52
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.200
if you're standing still,

53
00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:36.050
the rain falls on your head and you can tell the rain is coming from right up.

54
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.860
But if you start walking then because there's now a relative motion between you

55
00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:42.230
and the rain, the rain actually starts hitting you in the face, right?

56
00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:44.450
If you're carrying an umbrella, you have to tilt your umbrella forward.

57
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.550
You get exactly the same thing with stars, right?

58
00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:50.180
That actually the direction in which the Starlight is coming depends on the

59
00:02:50.181 --> 00:02:53.210
direction in which you're moving. If you're not moving, then you know,

60
00:02:53.211 --> 00:02:55.160
maybe the Starlight will be coming from directly ahead.

61
00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.100
But if the us moving then the net effect of that is that the Starlight appears

62
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:02.830
to come from a slightly different direction just because you had the relative

63
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:05.920
speeds together and you end up shifting the direction the is coming from.

64
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.800
And of course over the course of a year, as the earth goes around the sun,

65
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.020
its motion is in different directions at different times,

66
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:14.080
which means this effect shifts stars in different directions at different times

67
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:14.500
of the year.

68
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.400
So this guy Bradley figured all this out and actually used it to make the first

69
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:20.470
reasonably accurate measurement of the speed of light,

70
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.430
because it's all to do with the amount that this affects the size of this

71
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:26.620
effect, just depends on the relative speed of the earth,

72
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.050
which they knew compared to the speed of light.

73
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.620
Now that story is not quite true because it turns out,

74
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:36.130
of course you can't do it. So this involved adding speeds, right? That I said,

75
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.500
well, the speed of the things traveling at some speed.

76
00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:41.560
And then there's the relative motion of the earth. We added speeds together.

77
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.830
One of those speeds we added together in this particular case was the speed of

78
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:48.610
light. And you're not supposed to do that because you aren't into all sorts of

79
00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:50.080
relativistic effects. That says actually,

80
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:52.750
when you get close to the speed of light, you can't just add speeds together.

81
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.050
So that the real story is a little more complicated. And in fact,

82
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:59.320
stellar aberration was what led to the formation,

83
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.500
the formulation of special relativity, but at least in qualitative terms,

84
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:05.350
this idea of thinking about it in terms of rain falling on your head still works

85
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:08.620
pretty well. If we move forward to the 19th century, um,

86
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.850
there was an astronomer called John pond who was also interested in paradox and

87
00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:15.310
he pointed out an interesting thing, which is that,

88
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.830
that was just thinking about the earth moving around the sun. But of course,

89
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:20.560
if the sun's moving relative to the stars,

90
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.480
then that should produce the same effect.

91
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.340
What he pointed out is that if the sun were to accelerate or decelerate,

92
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:28.810
so if it speed were to change,

93
00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.560
then actually that change in speed would lead to a change in this effect just as

94
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:35.140
if you speed sped up or slowed down, walking in the rain.

95
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.990
And therefore you ought to see things move due to the acceleration or

96
00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:41.260
deceleration of the sun. A little bit later in the 19th century,

97
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.900
John Herschel came along and said, that's all very well.

98
00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:45.160
And it's a very neat idea,

99
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.270
but of course we now know as they did by then that the stars are all moving as

100
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:51.790
well. They will have their own proper motions. So he said, you know,

101
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:56.380
trying to separate out the motion that due to the acceleration of the

102
00:04:56.381 --> 00:04:59.830
sun from just the fact that the stars are all moving around anyway,

103
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.590
and we can now measure those is hopeless, right?

104
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:04.060
You're never actually going to be able to do that.

105
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.440
And the reason why suddenly it comes back to life again is Gaia is measuring the

106
00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:10.180
positions of billions of stars,

107
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:12.610
but it's also measuring some other things as well. And in particular,

108
00:05:12.611 --> 00:05:15.810
there are about a million quasars that it's measuring. So these,

109
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.230
these very distant galaxies were incredibly bright star like output because have

110
00:05:20.231 --> 00:05:22.870
central engines, they're central black holes are incredibly bright.

111
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.990
So to all intents and purposes, they look just like stars.

112
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.810
And so Gaia can measure them. But of course they don't move well.

113
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.010
They probably do move,

114
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:33.250
but there are such huge distances away that effectively they form an unmoving

115
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:33.880
reference frame.

116
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.740
That means that if pond's original idea was right and the sun

117
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.873
were accelerating,

118
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.270
then we should be able to detect it by looking for the aberration.

119
00:05:43.271 --> 00:05:45.550
It induces in all these distant quasars,

120
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:49.030
they'll all start to have a proper motion just due to the fact that the sun is

121
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:50.170
accelerating over time.

122
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.940
And so even though the signal in any one particular quasar is absolutely tiny

123
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.590
because we've got a million of them and we know what patterns to look for.

124
00:05:57.591 --> 00:06:01.400
We can kind of average all that information together to try and measure the

125
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:04.400
acceleration of the sun. And that's what this paper did.

126
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.950
<v 0>All right.</v>

127
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.070
This brings me to the question that's been burning a hole in my head for the

128
00:06:09.071 --> 00:06:12.790
last five to 10 minutes. Why is the Sonic celebrating at all?

129
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.630
<v 1>The main reason the is accelerating is because he's orbiting around the Milky</v>

130
00:06:16.631 --> 00:06:19.090
way. And of course, to get something to go round in a circle,

131
00:06:19.091 --> 00:06:20.140
you have to accelerate it.

132
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.320
There's this phenomenon called centripetal acceleration the movement there

133
00:06:23.321 --> 00:06:26.380
because it's not traveling in a straight line. It's velocity is changing.

134
00:06:26.381 --> 00:06:27.550
That means you're accelerating it.

135
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.820
So we get actually have a reasonable prediction as to what we expect the

136
00:06:30.821 --> 00:06:32.080
acceleration of the sun to be.

137
00:06:32.081 --> 00:06:36.130
And also what direction we expected to be in because centripetal acceleration,

138
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.680
it's seeking the center, centripetal acceleration.

139
00:06:38.681 --> 00:06:41.410
So it's actually all should be accelerating towards the center of the galaxy.

140
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.500
So that's the phenomenon. These guys measured. Let me just read the results,

141
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.730
our best estimates of the acceleration based on dire EDR threes.

142
00:06:48.731 --> 00:06:50.830
That's the data they look at is 2.3,

143
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.990
two plus or minus 0.16 times 10 to the minus 10 meters per second

144
00:06:55.991 --> 00:06:56.770
squared.

145
00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.850
So it's an acceleration of two times 10 to the minus 10 meters per second

146
00:07:00.851 --> 00:07:04.570
squared. So that's 0.9 zeros,

147
00:07:04.571 --> 00:07:08.800
two meters per second squared. That's a really small, that's absolutely tiny.

148
00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:10.600
It means over the course of a year,

149
00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.970
the speed of the sun changes by less than a centimeter

150
00:07:15.971 --> 00:07:16.750
per second.

151
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.320
<v 0>Where's the energy coming from to do that from gravity. Yeah.</v>

152
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.460
<v 1>It's just the pull of gravity stuff.</v>

153
00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.970
So the pull of gravity is what's pulling it round, accelerating it round.

154
00:07:24.971 --> 00:07:28.570
It's just Newton's second law force equals mass times acceleration where the

155
00:07:28.571 --> 00:07:31.210
force is the gravitational pull of the galaxy towards the center.

156
00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.720
And the acceleration is the centripetal acceleration towards the center. Now,

157
00:07:34.721 --> 00:07:37.090
the reason why it's tiny is you're, you're quite right.

158
00:07:37.091 --> 00:07:40.630
The actual acceleration on kind of astronomical timescales is quite large,

159
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.201
but that's the thing.

160
00:07:41.201 --> 00:07:43.900
You have to accelerate it around in a circle over the course of 200 million

161
00:07:43.901 --> 00:07:47.350
years, right? At the time it takes to go round. So that means the amount of the,

162
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.800
the, the speed needs to change. Each second is absolutely tiny.

163
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.570
So we think the sun's going around the Milky way at something like 230

164
00:07:55.571 --> 00:07:58.330
kilometers per second, we think we know the distance of the center.

165
00:07:58.331 --> 00:08:01.510
So actually we can predict what that acceleration more or less ought to be.

166
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.510
It's probably a bit more complicated because there'll be local effects,

167
00:08:04.511 --> 00:08:06.310
you know, that causing the sun to accelerate,

168
00:08:06.311 --> 00:08:08.440
there are nothing to do with that global acceleration,

169
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.610
but actually it turns out that the number they get here is almost exactly the

170
00:08:12.611 --> 00:08:15.520
same as that figure you would expect. And then of course,

171
00:08:15.521 --> 00:08:18.580
the last bit is I mentioned that not only do you get the size of the

172
00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.800
acceleration, you get the direction of the acceleration as well,

173
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.710
and the direction is pointed right at the center of the galaxy.

174
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:24.551
So this is exactly,

175
00:08:24.551 --> 00:08:27.790
exactly what you'd expect for that kind of centripetal acceleration effect.

176
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.770
<v 0>So they've used all these stars and this guy data to calculate something that</v>

177
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.900
could have calculated pretty easily at another way.

178
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.840
<v 1>You know, at some level it's a trivial calculation,</v>

179
00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.990
cause we sort of already knew what the answer is. It's sort of reassuring.

180
00:08:40.991 --> 00:08:42.130
It gave the right answer.

181
00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.270
Technically it's absolutely amazing that they can measure an acceleration

182
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:48.370
directly measured, you know, pre the previous, you know,

183
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.940
we think the acceleration has to be, this was all indirectly inferred, right?

184
00:08:51.941 --> 00:08:55.000
They've measured it, they've measured this acceleration, this tiny.

185
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.190
<v 3>Want it to point and keep it there.</v>

186
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.060
And it's actually surprisingly simple physics and it's all down to the

187
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:06.980
conservation of angular momentum. Now you might see in,

188
00:09:06.981 --> 00:09:10.770
in some science fiction shows like Battlestar Galactica or something like that,

189
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.440
uh, that they maneuver spacecraft with thrusters.
