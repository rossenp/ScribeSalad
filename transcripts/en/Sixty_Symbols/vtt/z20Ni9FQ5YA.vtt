1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.470
<v 0>Well, we talking about stars. Yeah. You always talk about stuff.</v>

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.110
Yeah. So this was just a question.

3
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.470
<v 1>And they came out and we were just chatting about this and we're talking about</v>

4
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.620
the kinds of stars. They're all in, in particular, you know, big stars,

5
00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:13.454
little stars.

6
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.650
<v 0>All right. What's the biggest star. That's all I care about.</v>

7
00:00:15.651 --> 00:00:16.550
Is that what you want? Okay.

8
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.370
<v 1>The biggest star, there it is. Doesn't look terribly inspiring.</v>

9
00:00:19.371 --> 00:00:23.030
That's because it's quite a long way away. It has the inspiring name of Oh one,

10
00:00:23.031 --> 00:00:26.210
three, six 81. It's actually in the large Magellanic cloud,

11
00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:28.040
which is one of our nearby neighbors.

12
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.410
<v 0>So the biggest step that we know is not even in.</v>

13
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.940
<v 1>The Milky way. Absolutely not.</v>

14
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.360
There's two reasons why it's hard to find a really big star in the Milky way.

15
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:36.920
One is when you're looking in the Milky way,

16
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.840
you always peering through all the merch,

17
00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:41.840
all the dust that's there between us and the center of the galaxy.

18
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.600
Whereas the large management and any cloud is conveniently well out of the plane

19
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.190
in the Milky way. So we can actually see it.

20
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.510
The other thing is that there's a lot of very strong star formation going on in

21
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.570
the large Magellanic cloud. Very massive stars are very rare.

22
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.750
And so actually you need to have an awful lot of star formation happening for

23
00:00:56.751 --> 00:00:59.000
there to be just one of these popping up. And secondly,

24
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:01.520
they don't live very long. They live a few million years,

25
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.640
which means that actually, you really got to, at least in astronomical terms,

26
00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:08.120
catch them just at the moment they're forming because actually if you blink and

27
00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:09.560
you miss it in astronomical terms.

28
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.830
So actually you've really got to see the star active star formation that's

29
00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:17.270
happening right now. So, Oh one, three, six is the general region. It's in a,

30
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.270
is the star cluster within that region. And one,

31
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.220
because it's the brightest star in that star cluster,

32
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.660
it's about 300 times the mass of the sun, which is big. And it's about,

33
00:01:26.661 --> 00:01:28.970
I think it's about 10 million times as bright as the sun.

34
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.700
When I realized it was thought that there weren't any stars,

35
00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:35.150
more massive than about a hundred, 150 solar masses. And there is actually,

36
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.840
there's a physical reason why you might expect there to be a limit for how big a

37
00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:43.070
star can be, which is that. So what makes a star is gravity pulls it together,

38
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.570
but there is a kind of a countervailing force, an outward force,

39
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.420
which is just due to the Starlight itself.

40
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.500
The radiation pressure from the star itself tries to push the star apart.

41
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.900
So the light itself is trying to push the star apart.

42
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.310
And the interesting thing is, as you go up to more and more massive stars,

43
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.880
the mass goes up. They get more massive, but they get a lot more luminous.

44
00:02:04.881 --> 00:02:07.640
So if you had a bit more mass to a store, it gets a bit more massive,

45
00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:09.020
but quite a lot more luminous.

46
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.230
And that means that even though in a star like the sun,

47
00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:14.210
this radiation pressure really doesn't matter. Very much.

48
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.450
Gravity always wins over the radiation pressure as you go up in mass,

49
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.350
the mass goes up, so the gravity goes up, but the brightness,

50
00:02:21.351 --> 00:02:23.240
the luminosity goes up a lot more.

51
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.630
And so actually the radiation pressure becomes more and more important.

52
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.640
And a fairly naive calculation says that the crossover point where the radiation

53
00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:34.100
pressure wins over gravity.

54
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.210
So the star would literally blow itself apart by its own radiation by its own

55
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:42.320
Starlight is about 150 solar masses. I sent Paul Crowder,

56
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.420
the guy who did this, an email saying,

57
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.510
why is it that there were announced stars more massive than we thought this

58
00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:49.190
limit ought to be? And he says,

59
00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:50.810
if the explanation is actually quite interesting,

60
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:54.770
but although for lower mass stars, as you go up a bit in mass,

61
00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:58.580
the luminosity goes up a lot. When you get to these very, very high mass stars,

62
00:02:58.581 --> 00:03:01.420
it turns out the two go up together that the mass goes up a bit and the

63
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:02.530
luminosity goes up a bit.

64
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.930
So there's no longer this kind of crossover point where the radiation pressure

65
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:10.300
wins in the end. So actually these very massive stars,

66
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.580
you haven't quite reached that crossover point.

67
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:16.000
And then you get never get any closer to it because gravity and the luminosity

68
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.490
go up together in the same way as it evolves,

69
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.310
it tends to lose mass stuff gets thrown off the outside.

70
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:23.410
So it becomes less massive and it gets brighter.

71
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.020
So actually these very massive stars, even though they can form,

72
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.620
eventually they will cross over that line because suddenly they get brighter and

73
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:30.191
less massive.

74
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:34.210
So suddenly the radiation pressure wins out over the gravity and they will blow

75
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:36.580
themselves apart quite quickly. Let me ask you the question.

76
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.160
How do you know something's a star, right? What's a star.

77
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.381
<v 0>Well,</v>

78
00:03:40.381 --> 00:03:45.240
a style is like a bowl of mainly hydrogen gas

79
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.010
that has like spontaneously started nuclear fusion.

80
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.140
<v 1>So you require it. That's an interesting definition.</v>

81
00:03:52.141 --> 00:03:54.510
Part of the definition as to whether you have nuclear fusion in there,

82
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.550
of course, by that definition of white dwarf,

83
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.430
isn't a star because he doesn't have nuclear fusion anymore,

84
00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.770
but it did at some point in his life, but not any longer.

85
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.400
There's no longer a source of energy in it. It's just glowing cause it's hot.

86
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.420
But for example, Jupiter gives out more light than it absorbs.

87
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.120
He actually glows in the dark and not because of nuclear fusion,

88
00:04:12.121 --> 00:04:15.930
but just because actually it's very slowly contracting with time centimeter or

89
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.410
so per year. And that gravitational contraction is actually liberating energy,

90
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.360
the, in the potential energy.

91
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.050
So actually if Jupiter emits more light than it absorbs,

92
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.350
it turns out both these ends of the spectrum are hard to actually detect the

93
00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:31.320
high mass stars are hard to detect because they're very rare and they don't live

94
00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:33.780
very long. The low-mass stars, they're plentiful,

95
00:04:33.781 --> 00:04:35.130
there's loads and loads of them around,

96
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.410
but they're so faint that they're actually hard to spot.

97
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.020
And actually it's only in our neighborhood that we can find them because they're

98
00:04:40.021 --> 00:04:44.160
so pathetically fine. So here is the lowest mass star known. There it is.

99
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.960
It's called STR 1845 minus six, three, five, seven.

100
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.820
That's about 15 light years away. Cool.

101
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.640
It turns out actually it has a companion, it's a Brown the wall.

102
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.860
And we see this one because we're seeing the reflected light from the star,

103
00:04:55.861 --> 00:04:56.760
but it's very, very fine.

104
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.540
<v 0>We're seeing a Brown dwarf that we normally wouldn't see because it's being</v>

105
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.250
shown upon by its neighbor, the sun, the most important stuff. Yep.

106
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.520
Where is that in the distribution of star sizes?

107
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.730
<v 1>Really in the middle, we really is not quite in the middle.</v>

108
00:05:11.731 --> 00:05:13.200
So if you think about, so the lowest mass,

109
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.440
so usually you think about these things on kind of a logarithmic scale.

110
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.690
The lowest mass stars are about a 10th.

111
00:05:18.691 --> 00:05:22.110
The mass of the sun and the highest mass stars are a few hundred times the mass

112
00:05:22.111 --> 00:05:23.430
of the sun. So it's not quite in the middle.

113
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.500
It's sort of somewhat towards the lower mass end,

114
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.470
which I guess you sort of expect, cause just there's more stars towards the end.

115
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.940
What about this pistol star pistol stars about 150 times the mass of the sun.

116
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.730
It's one of those, that's the kind of the brightest ones in the Milky way.

117
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.280
It might well be the biggest star in the Milky way and the most massive star in

118
00:05:38.281 --> 00:05:40.500
the Milky way. And it's quite spectacular to look at too.

119
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.160
The interesting thing about these very massive stars is that they tend to be in

120
00:05:44.161 --> 00:05:46.980
regions of intense star formation. So there's lots of gas around them.

121
00:05:46.981 --> 00:05:48.690
So they light it up and look very nice.

122
00:05:48.691 --> 00:05:51.270
And actually the other thing you sometimes find with them is because they tend

123
00:05:51.271 --> 00:05:54.150
to blow off their own outer layers. Cause they're not very well bound together.

124
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.970
You sometimes find features around them that had to do with that as well.

125
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.960
One of the things that people are interested in is the first doors that form

126
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.780
than what properties they had, although we've never observed them yet.

127
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.950
The prejudice is the expectation is that the first doors to form in the universe

128
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.890
were very massive stars. They have lifetimes of a few million years,

129
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:11.120
so they wouldn't have hung around very long,

130
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:13.730
but they would have seeded the universe with heavy elements.

131
00:06:13.731 --> 00:06:15.140
So you start off with the big bang,

132
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:17.540
which makes your hydrogen and helium and a bit of lithium,

133
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:18.650
but anything heavier than that,

134
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:23.600
you need stars for the oldest stars that we can see around us today actually

135
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:24.710
have heavy elements in them.

136
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.260
So we know they weren't the first generation of stars. They were at the,

137
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.440
the earliest, the kind of second generation of stars. There's two,

138
00:06:30.441 --> 00:06:33.500
at least two reasons to think that those first generations of stars might've

139
00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:35.570
been very massive. One is to make a star.

140
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.440
You need gas clouds to kind of fragment and collapse and to get something to

141
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:41.810
fragment and collapse, you need to be able to cool down.

142
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.860
And one of the things that the heavy elements do is they sort of accelerate the

143
00:06:45.861 --> 00:06:49.730
cooling process. They allow gas to cool down. And so with heavy elements,

144
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:52.820
you can kind of create quite low temperature regions and actually have little

145
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:56.300
things collapsing to make little stars. If you don't have those heavy elements,

146
00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.020
it's very hard for gas to cool down, which means you tend to make big things.

147
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.060
Cause it just doesn't fragment into those little bits.

148
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.300
So we think probably that just that process of collapse,

149
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.600
we probably tend to make bigger stars in the early universe because it's hard

150
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:10.880
for little things to cool down and collapse because you don't have the heavy

151
00:07:10.881 --> 00:07:11.360
elements.

152
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.480
The other is that process we were talking about about like competition between

153
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:17.720
gravity and radiation. The what's happening is the radiation is,

154
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:22.700
is kind of driving its way out and smacking into things. And the,

155
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.330
the interactions are much stronger. If you have the heavy elements there,

156
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.910
the capacity that how a pike,

157
00:07:28.911 --> 00:07:32.570
the stories depends enormously on how much of those heavy elements there are.

158
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.870
So stars are much more transparent if you don't have heavy elements,

159
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.360
which means that rather than pushing the star apart,

160
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.700
that radiation tends to be able to escape more easily.

161
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.380
So that process competition between the gravity pulling things in and the

162
00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:47.720
radiation pushing it apart, if you don't have the heavy elements,

163
00:07:47.721 --> 00:07:50.000
it's harder for the radiation to push things apart.

164
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.700
So therefore you can actually make bigger and bigger stars.

165
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:57.680
So that side of the process tends to make more massive stores

166
00:07:57.681 --> 00:07:58.514
stable.

167
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.220
If you haven't got the heavy elements as we did in the early parts of the

168
00:08:01.221 --> 00:08:01.810
universe.

169
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.270
<v 2>We won't be able to see them where we, by looking back in time.</v>

170
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.050
<v 1>Plan. Yeah. So next generation of telescopes, James Webb, space telescope,</v>

171
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.260
next generation of ground-based telescopes, next generation of space telescopes.

172
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.500
We really want to be looking for those first doors to form and we will actually

173
00:08:14.501 --> 00:08:16.810
have the sensitivity to find the particularly if they're very massive.

174
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.760
Cause of course, very massive things are very bright.

175
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.680
So hopefully we will in the, you know, on the timescale of maybe a decade or so,

176
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.260
be able to see those first doors as they formed.

177
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:27.453
<v 2>Wow.</v>

178
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.020
Four five nine two

179
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:41.380
(378) 166-2862.
