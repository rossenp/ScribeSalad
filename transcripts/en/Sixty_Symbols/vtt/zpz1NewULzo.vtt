00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>So I knew you were coming in to do some filming.</v>

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.710
And I was wondering into work thinking about what to talk about and it was

3
00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:07.320
raining and I was getting a bit wet. But as I was wondering along,

4
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.100
I just cited idly thinking about rain. And in particular,

5
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:14.640
why is that raindrops are kind of that big, rather than that big,

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.760
I guess it sort of starts by what size his raindrops actually are.

7
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.300
And in particular fact that they're not actually all the same size.

8
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.050
There is a distribution of raindrop size. And in fact, the,

9
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.170
some of the early work on this was done by a guy called Wilson Bentley.

10
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.710
He was a fascinating guy. He was kind of a, an autodidact.

11
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.640
He taught himself all the science. He did, he was fascinated by science. Uh,

12
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.720
he was a farmer from Vermont at the beginning of the 20th century. And, uh,

13
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.840
he was really interested in things that fell out of the sky. So for example,

14
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:47.070
he made sort of the definitive set of photographs of snowflakes and was really

15
00:00:47.071 --> 00:00:49.680
the person who showed that snowflakes of all different shapes.

16
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.580
But one of the other things he looked at was rain and he measured with a rather

17
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.540
elegant experiment,

18
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.440
the sizes of the drops that fall out of the sky in different types of rainfall.

19
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.810
Um, so he'd had this very neat experiment. He took a, uh, a tray full of flour.

20
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.890
So it sort of fairly shallow layer of flour in a tray and just put it out in the

21
00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:09.690
rain for a couple of seconds, pulled it back in again.

22
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.300
And so the raindrops would kind of fall in and soak some of the flour.

23
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.120
<v 1>He then wait for the little pellet.</v>

24
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.400
<v 0>So it kind of formed out of that to dry and then pick them out of the flour.</v>

25
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.910
And then the sizes of the pellets told them about the size of the raindrops.

26
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.090
<v 1>In a ratio, or were they the same, like.</v>

27
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.530
<v 0>I think sort of coincidentally, they turn out to be, so he,</v>

28
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.830
he did the proper thing. So it was, you know,

29
00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:39.110
the scientific experiments is you then calibrate your results.

30
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:43.100
So he actually took drops of known size and drop them from varying Heights into

31
00:01:43.101 --> 00:01:45.980
flour and found out what sizes of pellets they made.

32
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.400
And he found that basically the size of the pellets corresponded almost exactly

33
00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:51.410
to the size of the drop that fell in, in the first place.

34
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.500
So just by measuring this, the sort of size distribution of the pellets,

35
00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:56.780
he was able to find out about the size distribution of rain.

36
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.100
I actually have his paper here.

37
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.340
So here's his paper where he explains his experiment and so on,

38
00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:04.730
but he actually has photographs of some of his experiments showing what the

39
00:02:04.731 --> 00:02:07.610
raindrops look like. And you can see, again,

40
00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:10.820
this is sort of ranges of different sizes, some little drops, some big drops,

41
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.810
but he also found that sometimes the size distribution was more uniform.

42
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.020
Sometimes there were bigger drops. Sometimes there were smaller drops. Um,

43
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:21.500
so he basically found that the, the, as a rule of thumb, the heavier,

44
00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:24.410
the rain was the bigger the drops are. Um, but beyond that,

45
00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:26.750
he quite found quite a variety of different outcomes.

46
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.570
He was indeed the pioneer in this and people then went on to make more

47
00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:33.590
quantitative measurements and sort of studied findings of empirical rules.

48
00:02:33.591 --> 00:02:36.440
So here's a paper gave him one of the definitive papers on this,

49
00:02:36.441 --> 00:02:40.700
which is actually only one page long by Marshall and Palmer in 1948.

50
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.460
And what they found is that with different rates of rainfall.

51
00:02:43.461 --> 00:02:46.460
So this is the sort of the number of drops versus drop size.

52
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.700
So what they found is that there were lots of little drops and then many fewer

53
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.750
bigger drops. And in fact, this is a log scale up here. So this is actually,

54
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.261
you know,

55
00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:57.560
this is a hundred times as many drops this size as they're all this size.

56
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.850
So it's, this is actually because this out as a straight line on this scale,

57
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.860
that means it's actually an exponential distribution.

58
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:05.020
There are lots and lots of little ones and not very many big ones.

59
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.300
It's always follows the same kind of distribution,

60
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.110
but the sort of calibration of it depends on how heavy the rainfall is that in,

61
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:12.580
in heavier rain, you get bigger drops.

62
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.310
There's something very beautiful about like just humans studying rain. It is,

63
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.490
although it actually, it turns out it has application it's two. So for example,

64
00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:24.090
one of the issues about a radio wave propagation. So if you're trying to, uh,

65
00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.750
broadcast radio, or if you've got radar it's affected by raindrops,

66
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.140
and it depends on the size distribution of the raindrops and actually the shapes

67
00:03:31.141 --> 00:03:32.220
of the raindrops as well.

68
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.070
So there is actually a sort of a practical application,

69
00:03:35.071 --> 00:03:37.950
as well as it just being an interesting thing to find out about the world.

70
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.270
So now we need to sort of get to the bottom of why raindrops are the size they

71
00:03:42.271 --> 00:03:44.730
are and why they grow to a certain size and no bigger,

72
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.480
which means we kind of need to go back and look at the physics a bit more about

73
00:03:48.481 --> 00:03:50.640
how raindrops grow in the first place. Okay,

74
00:03:50.641 --> 00:03:53.850
so you have a cloud and a raindrop will start to form. And really,

75
00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:57.930
so this is a sort of a cloud of water vapor, and it's going to start condensing.

76
00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.250
So to start condensing,

77
00:03:59.251 --> 00:04:02.760
typically you need something which sort of seeds the condensation.

78
00:04:02.761 --> 00:04:06.360
So it's thought that just a tiny little grain of dust or something is there in

79
00:04:06.361 --> 00:04:09.240
the cloud, which water then will start to settle on.

80
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.160
So you start forming a drop and that drop will grow. There'll be more, you know,

81
00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:14.994
more water will,

82
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.670
will grow onto that drop and also drops will crash into each other.

83
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.000
So they'll grow both by sort of, uh, creating stuff from the vapor,

84
00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:23.820
but also by smashing into each other and growing into bigger drops that way.

85
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.490
And as they start to grow, they start out as completely round.

86
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.630
And the physics as to why they're completely round is to do with surface

87
00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:33.960
tension, the surface tension sort of pools the thing into an interest sphere.

88
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.110
It, maybe I should draw a picture for this. Can I draw a picture? Yeah,

89
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.270
let's have a picture. A water molecule fits in the middle of the water.

90
00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:44.880
It's surrounded by lots of other water molecules and they're all pulling it

91
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:45.743
towards them.

92
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.230
And so basically there's no net force on our water molecule in the middle here.

93
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.090
But if you get near the surface, you got a water molecule, you here,

94
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.490
then there's more molecules below it than there are above it.

95
00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.580
And that means there's a sort of imbalanced force.

96
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.520
There's more things pulling it downwards than the wall pulling it outwards.

97
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.030
So if you can imagine trying to take an individual water molecule and pull it up

98
00:05:06.031 --> 00:05:08.460
to the surface that in here, you can move it around how you like,

99
00:05:08.461 --> 00:05:09.750
but as you get close to the surface,

100
00:05:09.751 --> 00:05:12.000
the other water molecule was trying to pull it back down again.

101
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.910
So you actually have to do some work to get it up near the surface.

102
00:05:14.911 --> 00:05:17.430
You actually having to fight quite hard to get it to the surface.

103
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.720
That actually means there's energy stored in the water molecules closer to the

104
00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:26.400
surface. And so the more surface area you have, the more energy,

105
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.260
potential energy there is stored up there.

106
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.730
And nature being kind of lazy prefers to have the lowest energy state.

107
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.210
And so therefore the lowest energy state for any, uh,

108
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.750
collection of water is the one that minimizes the amount of energy stored near

109
00:05:39.751 --> 00:05:40.584
the surface,

110
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.370
which means you basically want to minimize the surface area of the object and

111
00:05:44.371 --> 00:05:49.140
for any given blob of water, the shape, which minimizes the surface energy,

112
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.033
energy as a sphere.

113
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.180
And so that's why small amounts of water will arrange themselves into spheres

114
00:05:54.181 --> 00:05:58.100
because surface tension makes that the lowest energy and that's,

115
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.210
so that's how it ends up being.

116
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.080
<v 2>Does that mean we need a seed like a,</v>

117
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.020
as a grain of dust or something for every raindrop.

118
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.080
<v 0>There has to be yes, because the raindrops have to know where to form.</v>

119
00:06:08.081 --> 00:06:09.610
So there's something special about that place,

120
00:06:09.611 --> 00:06:12.190
which of which the simplest thing is just a tiny little grain of dust,

121
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.570
probably microscopic in size,

122
00:06:13.571 --> 00:06:16.120
but there's just something up there which makes it seed at that particular

123
00:06:16.121 --> 00:06:17.440
point. Okay. So you made your job.

124
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.410
It starts out being spherical because because of the surface tension effects,

125
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.820
it's then starting to fall.

126
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.400
And that means that basically from the raindrops perspective,

127
00:06:24.401 --> 00:06:27.640
the air is kind of rushing up past it. And at that point,

128
00:06:27.641 --> 00:06:29.770
we have to start worrying about aerodynamics.

129
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.790
Now we made a whole video about Lyft and aerodynamics and what have you.

130
00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:36.820
And perhaps the only lesson from that is that aerodynamics is really rather

131
00:06:36.821 --> 00:06:37.654
complicated.

132
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.410
And this is even more complicated because it's not like a wing or it's something

133
00:06:41.411 --> 00:06:43.750
like that, which is a fixed shape. This is a raindrop,

134
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.050
which means that as the air rushes past it, it can rearrange it shape.

135
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.300
So not only do you have to worry about the flow of air,

136
00:06:49.301 --> 00:06:51.910
but you have to worry about what it's doing to the shape of the object.

137
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.130
<v 2>Like a wing made of jelly.</v>

138
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.140
<v 0>Exactly. And not surprisingly, you know,</v>

139
00:06:56.141 --> 00:06:58.390
you've got quite a lot of air pressure and things happening.

140
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.780
It will all deformed and you'll end up with, uh, with the thing,

141
00:07:01.781 --> 00:07:02.614
no longer being.

142
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.350
<v 2>That's where we get a beautiful raindrop shape from it.</v>

143
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.410
<v 0>Sadly not though. So you think so because you know,</v>

144
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:09.850
raindrop nice era for your shape,

145
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.950
it turns out that it's not the shape you end up with.

146
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.920
And although the physics is really rather complicated,

147
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.720
there's a quite a simple way to think about it,

148
00:07:16.721 --> 00:07:17.830
which is that as the thing is falling,

149
00:07:17.831 --> 00:07:20.830
this kind of air pressure from its perspective, it's being pushed from below.

150
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.610
And so what the simplest thing that starts to happen is it just starts to

151
00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:28.030
flatten at the bottom. And so now the air keeps flying around it,

152
00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:29.860
but now it's got to kind of got a flat bottom to it.

153
00:07:29.861 --> 00:07:31.600
So it's like a hamburger buns shape.

154
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.630
It ends up being sort of still round on the top of that flat on the bottom.

155
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.110
So then that process sort of continues. The pressure below keeps going.

156
00:07:38.111 --> 00:07:41.650
And what happens is it actually starts to the bottom starts, isn't even flat.

157
00:07:41.651 --> 00:07:45.370
It starts to turn a concave. Um, and at that point,

158
00:07:45.371 --> 00:07:47.500
air kind of gets trapped inside the thing.

159
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:52.600
And your whole raindrop actually blows up like a little balloon with a kind of a

160
00:07:52.601 --> 00:07:53.920
ring of water at the bottom of it.

161
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.100
And then not surprisingly that surface tension is not enough to hold the thing

162
00:07:57.101 --> 00:07:59.620
together. And then it bursts into a thousand little fragments.

163
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.060
So you can't actually have a big raindrop because it's unstable in that way.

164
00:08:04.061 --> 00:08:06.580
The air pressure will kind of blow it up and make it exploded.

165
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:15.760
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

166
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.290
<v 2>Almost acting like a parachute.</v>

167
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:20.470
<v 0>It is. Yeah. And so let me show you a picture. These really are fascinating,</v>

168
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:22.450
cute things. So here's some experiments.

169
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.140
And so this is still an active area of research. This is a, an, uh,

170
00:08:26.141 --> 00:08:27.370
an article in nature physics,

171
00:08:27.371 --> 00:08:30.550
which is one of the more prestigious journals in physics from 2009.

172
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:34.120
And so here's the picture. Here's our large raindrop starting to fall.

173
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.190
It gets flatter as it falls.

174
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:39.970
Then you can see at some point it actually starts to inflate this little bag

175
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.390
forms above it. The surface tension holds it together for a little while,

176
00:08:43.391 --> 00:08:44.890
then it bursts in the hole. And then the,

177
00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:47.320
actually the ring that's left behind fragments as well.

178
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.570
And you end up with many, many tiny fragments.

179
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.370
<v 2>So at what point in the journey are we, is, is it still up in the cloud here?</v>

180
00:08:54.371 --> 00:08:58.050
Has it fallen 10 miles? Like what, how long does this take?

181
00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.100
<v 0>It depends how big, how quickly it goes Briggs. So if you have a rain drop,</v>

182
00:09:01.101 --> 00:09:03.740
that goes big very quickly. This happens very early on.

183
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.590
If you have a raindrops which stay small, this process will never happen.

184
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:10.010
It'll actually just stay sort of raindrop shaped and keep falling. Um,

185
00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.520
so it really is when the things grow above a millimeter or so in size,

186
00:09:13.521 --> 00:09:15.410
that's when this, these processes start to happen.

187
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:21.050
<v 2>When they shatter into lots of small fragments, what happens to those fragments?</v>

188
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.470
<v 0>So in principle, if there was time, the whole process, we start all over again,</v>

189
00:09:24.471 --> 00:09:27.680
and it was thought that they would start growing again. The interesting thing,

190
00:09:27.681 --> 00:09:31.730
and the point of this paper actually is that the distribution of these fragment

191
00:09:31.731 --> 00:09:36.680
sizes is exactly the same as the distribution that these guys

192
00:09:36.681 --> 00:09:38.720
found of what was actually hitting the ground.

193
00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.410
So the hypothesis they come up with this and in this paper,

194
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.240
is that actually what happens is that the,

195
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.230
that this process only happens once that the rain large raindrop forms,

196
00:09:48.231 --> 00:09:50.990
it shatters into this distribution of smaller fragments.

197
00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.300
And those are the things which fall on your head at the ground level.

198
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:56.960
And that then the size distribution of leaves then matches the distribution that

199
00:09:56.961 --> 00:09:58.070
we see in actual raindrops.

200
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.140
<v 2>So those, the fragments, the shrapnel that lands on us,</v>

201
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.290
doesn't go through the balloon process. Again.

202
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.500
<v 0>It looks like it. And they argue just on the basis of the timescales,</v>

203
00:10:09.501 --> 00:10:11.540
that there isn't time that you can figure out the amount of time.

204
00:10:11.541 --> 00:10:15.320
It takes a raindrop to fall to the ground and then sort of do some calculations

205
00:10:15.321 --> 00:10:17.630
as to how quickly it should grow. And the answer is it does,

206
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.550
it just doesn't have time to go through that cycle. Again.

207
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.451
<v 2>Mike,</v>

208
00:10:20.451 --> 00:10:24.950
it feels like this ballooning and traditional process would happen so quickly.

209
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.550
And cloud seems so high up in the sky that you'd feel like this would go through

210
00:10:28.551 --> 00:10:30.710
lots of iterations, but, but no.

211
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.070
<v 0>I think the issue is that in a cloud, you have a lot of water vapor,</v>

212
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.340
which means that actually things can happen very quickly by the time that things

213
00:10:37.341 --> 00:10:40.430
are in that. So this sort of fall phase, there isn't that much water around.

214
00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:43.010
So the chances of things bumping into each other are much lower.

215
00:10:43.011 --> 00:10:45.560
The chances of more water accreting onto your dropper, much lower.

216
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.020
So there just isn't time for these processes to happen.

217
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.110
They happen quite quickly in the clouds because it's just a lot of water there,

218
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.840
but by the time the things are falling, there's lots of gaps between the water.

219
00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:54.770
And so it doesn't happen again.

220
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:55.251
<v 2>Well,</v>

221
00:10:55.251 --> 00:10:58.580
I thought the shrapnel pieces would have the chance to go through the balloon

222
00:10:58.581 --> 00:11:00.380
process or are they too small for that now?

223
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.840
<v 0>No. So they are now back in this regime where the,</v>

224
00:11:02.841 --> 00:11:05.990
the surface tension is the winning force so that they will then turn back into

225
00:11:05.991 --> 00:11:07.460
these more or less verical things.

226
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.520
So the raindrops which fall on your head probably are more or less round.

227
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.800
<v 2>Hi everyone, professor Mike Merrifield, are you just watching this video? Well,</v>

228
00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:16.640
he's an astronomer.

229
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.500
You can see even more of his videos here on 60 symbols or our special astronomy

230
00:11:21.501 --> 00:11:25.370
channel, deep sky videos. There are links on the screen and in the description,

231
00:11:25.371 --> 00:11:29.810
of course, but Mike's also become the unofficial weatherman of 60 symbols.

232
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.920
He's done videos on lightning, rainbows and clouds.

233
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.260
There's a whole playlist. Again,

234
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.720
there's a link on the screen and down in the description.
