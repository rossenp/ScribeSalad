00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.850
<v 0>Juan Pablo Escobar. Welcome to Scandinavia.</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 1>Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be</v>

3
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.130
[inaudible].

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.540
<v 0>Your name? These days is Sabastian merkin. Uh, is,</v>

5
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:19.010
is that because, uh, the Escobar name is too much.

6
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.820
<v 1>It is because, uh, the airlines,</v>

7
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.830
they didn't want to sell any plane tickets to travel and to

8
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.170
get away from violence. You know, we,

9
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.170
we stayed in Columbia for a year waiting for somebody to help us

10
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.850
after, after your father died,

11
00:00:37.851 --> 00:00:42.140
after my father's dad and we as the bodycon the United

12
00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:44.360
nations, and nobody wanted to help us.

13
00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:48.710
So it was our last option if we wanted to stay alive.

14
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.600
<v 0>So that was when you could leave the country with your mother and your family.</v>

15
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.490
<v 1>The next day we changed our names we could fly with without any</v>

16
00:00:58.491 --> 00:00:59.324
problems.

17
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.990
<v 0>Um, we, we saw some pictures of your father. Uh,</v>

18
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.780
um, if you were to estimate

19
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.210
how many murders is he directly or indirectly responsible for?

20
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.250
<v 1>Well, there is not, uh, an official record of that,</v>

21
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.300
but I believe that it is almost about 3000 people.

22
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.220
<v 0>Um, and yet to you, he is a very different person. He's,</v>

23
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.150
uh, your father and you knew him as a very different person.

24
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.750
<v 1>The murder. I know, uh, both, uh,</v>

25
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.030
I know both because I, he was my father, but also he was abandoned.

26
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.950
And when I was seven years old, he told me, look, I am a band-aid,

27
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.570
that's what I do for a living.

28
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.880
<v 0>Before this, before you really knew who, what kind of father was he?</v>

29
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.230
<v 1>Well, he was, uh, as far back as he can remember. Well,</v>

30
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.880
I remember him giving me a lot of love, uh, being, uh,

31
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.230
at home with me and my family. Uh, he was a very good man with me.

32
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.950
I receive a lot of love from him. That's what I remember.

33
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.720
I also remember when we went to see the poor villages

34
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.420
in Columbia and to help them.

35
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.700
And that's the father that I knew at the beginning, but of course,

36
00:02:25.701 --> 00:02:29.810
he's now more remember, eh, thanks to his violence. Uh,

37
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.350
not for his good behavior at the week.

38
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.350
<v 0>You're describing also as vain person.</v>

39
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.410
<v 1>Well, yes. Yeah, he really took care of his own hair and</v>

40
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.900
he stayed in front of the mirror for too many hours just to

41
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.970
watch his States.

42
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.770
So he took like two hours for him and

43
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.060
to get ready in the morning anyway. Yeah. And I, I asked him, what,

44
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.350
what did he take you so long? And he told me, Oh,

45
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:05.170
you can go to the dentist. I can't.

46
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.930
<v 0>You, you, you call him a bad loser too.</v>

47
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.720
<v 1>Well, he didn't want to lose. He was always cheating even to me or to my mom,</v>

48
00:03:15.721 --> 00:03:19.860
to everybody. He didn't want to lose at all when he played soccer,

49
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.530
uh, the game only end when he was winning. And that's it.

50
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.700
<v 0>Um, w w what, if you play the board game or you had some.</v>

51
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.470
<v 1>Well, we, yeah, we used to play monopoly, monopoly, and, uh,</v>

52
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.950
yes, he hide all the, the money and everything.

53
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.030
And even if he lose a lot, he was always winning. And I didn't know why,

54
00:03:42.031 --> 00:03:46.350
but it was making a lot of, uh, he was cheating a lot. Yeah.

55
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.340
Yeah.

56
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.890
<v 0>Th th growing up as, as, as you did,</v>

57
00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:54.510
as the son of one of the world's richest man, according to the Forbes list,

58
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.403
at least, well.

59
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.490
<v 1>Nobody, I didn't saw anybody from Forbes in our family.</v>

60
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.970
Don't get into our, our wallets. It's, uh,

61
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.150
there is a way to sell a lot of magazines.

62
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.250
<v 0>It's still, he a very rich man. He.</v>

63
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.200
<v 1>Was a very rich man and I asked him how money, how much money do you have?</v>

64
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.620
And, and he, he told me, I don't know,

65
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.690
I really don't want to count that.

66
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.690
<v 0>How could you, uh,</v>

67
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.520
how could you notice that he was rich? I mean, what would you, what level of,

68
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.230
or w were you a spoiled, spoiled child or did he.

69
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.780
<v 1>Well, of course I receive a lot of, uh,</v>

70
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.810
presence from him.

71
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.790
I have more than Teddy motorcycles and we have our own SU private

72
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.000
too. You have how many motorcycles? So more than 30,

73
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.490
more than 30 motorcycles. Yeah.

74
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.130
<v 0>Yeah. That's as per child, if.</v>

75
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.060
<v 1>I have it, but he gave me a lot of love and education,</v>

76
00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:58.860
and he always was very near me at the time

77
00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.970
when he came out.

78
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.240
<v 0>Well, you had this, you had this famous mansion called, uh,</v>

79
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.250
Hussey and Annapolis. Uh, and th this was really a big estate,

80
00:05:08.251 --> 00:05:09.030
a big property.

81
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.510
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

82
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.040
We have our own airport and also more than 10 houses,

83
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.140
more than a hundred vehicles for us and for the guests.

84
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.670
And if you didn't find anything inside the Hacienda,

85
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.740
you just could ask, uh, the chopper to go and buy that. So.

86
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.100
<v 0>And, and, and you had a zoo as well. Yeah.</v>

87
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.570
<v 1>Yes. Sue and, and a lot of themes more than 100,</v>

88
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.770
more than 1000 animals from all over the world.

89
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.260
We have hippos Veda [inaudible].

90
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.770
<v 0>Yes. So how did they get them? How, I mean, this is.</v>

91
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.510
<v 1>Uh, well, he just sends a lot of people around the world to buy them. And,</v>

92
00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:00.110
and I also went with him to some Seuss inside the United States to

93
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.460
buy some other animals. He paid $2 million for the elephants.

94
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.480
<v 0>You were, uh, I mean,</v>

95
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.160
you were also the son of a politician, not only a drug dealer,

96
00:06:12.161 --> 00:06:15.820
but a politician as well. I mean, Pablo Escobar was, uh,

97
00:06:15.821 --> 00:06:20.500
an ambitious politician. Well, yes. And, and he, he,

98
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.560
um, he got far, uh,

99
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.860
but at some point it was like the,

100
00:06:26.861 --> 00:06:30.880
the political establishment in Colombia, uh, realized who he was,

101
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.920
what he did and rejected him. Well, my father fell.

102
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.140
<v 1>Well, my father felt here humiliated.</v>

103
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.160
And the first answer was he resigned publicly.

104
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.970
And after that, he ordered the killing of the minister of justice.

105
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.750
And that was the year 1984. Exactly.

106
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.820
And after that,

107
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.160
all the word began from the drug trafficking business against

108
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.580
Colombia, as a country, as their government, the authorities,

109
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.860
everything was scales.

110
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.810
<v 0>So from, from that day on really became real.</v>

111
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:12.070
<v 1>Yeah. It really changed a Columbia's life, our family's life, everybody.</v>

112
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.830
<v 0>And you were, you were mostly on the run.</v>

113
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.700
<v 1>Since then, from like everybody. Yes.</v>

114
00:07:18.701 --> 00:07:22.930
Like I felt like I was abandoned because everybody was chasing

115
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.213
also me.

116
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.690
I saw the reward signs asking for me.

117
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.340
<v 0>What, why, why did they chase you?</v>

118
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:36.070
<v 1>Well, at the time the police in Columbia didn't recognize us as</v>

119
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.920
individuals. They thought we were the same.

120
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.800
They went out through his family as well after everybody. Yeah.

121
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.340
<v 0>How, how did you, I mean, how did you react to this? Did you,</v>

122
00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:48.880
did you talk to your father about this? Did you try to change it?

123
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.470
<v 1>Of course, I did that a lot of times when you were mostly yes.</v>

124
00:07:53.471 --> 00:07:57.430
Mostly when I was 11 years old in 1988,

125
00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:03.250
there was a car bomb exploded in Metagene January 13

126
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.450
against our home.

127
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.440
It was thanks to the Cali cartel that boom seven,

128
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.060
700 kilos of dynamite, who is much older,

129
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.210
older glasses around one kilometer around the city.

130
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.310
Everything was the,

131
00:08:18.311 --> 00:08:23.290
I remember the newspaper they call that Metagene woke up as

132
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:24.340
Beirut.

133
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.070
<v 0>But the how, how did you survive that? If it was meant.</v>

134
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.480
<v 1>It is a miracle. I have the pictures. I don't know. I can understand how.</v>

135
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.500
<v 0>What happened? Did you wake up and Jew or, I mean.</v>

136
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.800
<v 1>What's the last part you see when you're going to sleep the ceiling? Now, when,</v>

137
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:44.140
when, when I get up, I saw the sky, there was nothing left,

138
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:45.873
but we were there.

139
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.890
<v 0>Do you remember the conversations you had with your father, where you tried to,</v>

140
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.630
to, to reach him to change?

141
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.490
<v 1>Of course. Well, when I saw the bumps in the news,</v>

142
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.470
I told him, look, what's going on. You don't, you don't have to do this.

143
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.160
You should not do this. A lot of innocent people is dying.

144
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:10.260
And he told me, he answered me. Look, I didn't invent this.

145
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:14.670
They use this against my family, my beloved ones. And I asked,

146
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:15.780
I answered to him.

147
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:21.060
If anybody puts me a bomb that doesn't allow me to put

148
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.410
bombs to everybody, I don't believe in violence.

149
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:30.360
And that's maybe that's why he approached the government and try

150
00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:32.670
to, you know,

151
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.370
when he's rendered to the cathedral prison,

152
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.120
it was a way of showing the family

153
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.420
a little bit of respect. So he wanted to make peace.

154
00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:49.560
He wants to end violence in Colombia and he's rendered.

155
00:09:49.561 --> 00:09:54.360
And my mother was doing the same thing was just challenging him and ask him

156
00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:56.610
him. Why didn't he stop by?

157
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.540
<v 0>Did he, how did he react when you challenged him?</v>

158
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.500
<v 1>Well, he was very respectful. I will, I may say, but.</v>

159
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.040
<v 0>So he didn't, it wasn't aggressive.</v>

160
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.730
<v 1>Or he, he was open to the conversation,</v>

161
00:10:10.731 --> 00:10:15.140
but he wasn't willing to change anything. You know,

162
00:10:15.141 --> 00:10:18.260
the CIA was after him, the FBI,

163
00:10:18.261 --> 00:10:22.250
everybody was after him and nobody could stop him. Neither do I,

164
00:10:22.251 --> 00:10:24.200
as a 14 year old kid.

165
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.980
<v 0>He volunteered for prison. As you mentioned,</v>

166
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.350
a prison that he got to build himself.

167
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:35.630
<v 1>Well, he's the first bandaid in human history that really,</v>

168
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.670
and actually built his own prison. And he changed quite comfortable as well,

169
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.760
very comfortable. And then he ran away again. Yeah.

170
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:48.590
When the government ordered the two translated him to

171
00:10:48.591 --> 00:10:52.670
another place and they, he get out of the prison.

172
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:54.560
He was the owner of the prison.

173
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.510
<v 0>He was the,</v>

174
00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:01.880
the greatest producer of narcotics in the world at some point.

175
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:03.410
<v 1>Well,</v>

176
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:08.030
he's accused of being the owner of the 80% of the market

177
00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:09.103
in the eighties.

178
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:10.280
<v 0>Yeah. Okay. Okay.</v>

179
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:15.170
Do you have any memories of the drugs in your family?

180
00:11:15.171 --> 00:11:19.130
Did anyone in your family use drugs, as you remember?

181
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:20.503
<v 1>Well,</v>

182
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.860
I have an uncle who died because of drug abuse.

183
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.730
And we are very aware of that. And when I was eight years old,

184
00:11:28.731 --> 00:11:31.970
my father talked to me about drugs.

185
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:37.280
He put all the drugs in front of me and he teach me

186
00:11:37.281 --> 00:11:39.350
how to recognize every one of them.

187
00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:44.870
He told me what happened if I use of every kind

188
00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:49.460
of them. And he told me if you ever want to try you come.

189
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:52.790
And we will try together. After that,

190
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.790
I felt that there was a legalization for me. So I,

191
00:11:57.791 --> 00:12:02.260
I didn't felt curious. And I never tried. So you never tried? No.

192
00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:05.710
Until I was 28 years old, I tried marijuana. And that's it.

193
00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.600
<v 0>Did, did he try himself? Do you think he used it in that?</v>

194
00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:12.960
<v 1>He told me that he tried all of them, but not heroin.</v>

195
00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:17.340
And he told me that he always liked

196
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.460
marijuana, but nothing more. He taught me,

197
00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:25.320
he teach me that cocaine was a poison to sell and not

198
00:12:25.321 --> 00:12:26.154
to take.

199
00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:33.840
<v 0>When you were 16, your father died.</v>

200
00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.890
Yes. And you, you were the last person to talk to him.

201
00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.570
Uh, he called you up. Why do you think he called you?

202
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.240
<v 1>Because he wanted to be found he was away of committing suicide</v>

203
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.070
because my father.

204
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.640
<v 0>Because the fact the family you were in hide, no, you were in yeah.</v>

205
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.320
In hiding in an apartment. Right? Well.

206
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.020
<v 1>We try to get out of the country.</v>

207
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.800
We flew to Germany and the authorities there,

208
00:13:01.801 --> 00:13:05.340
they make us against our wire wheel.

209
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.730
They make us return to Columbia. And after that,

210
00:13:08.731 --> 00:13:13.410
my father understood that there was no will be never any

211
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.300
safe place for his family.

212
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:20.550
And he understood that either we are going to appear

213
00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:25.560
as that, or he had to choose that. That's why he started calling.

214
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.230
He has his body guard near to him.

215
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:33.240
He always teach me not to use the telephone because he was death as

216
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.060
his own words, don't use telephone because his death,

217
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.360
that's why he started calling more than seven times.

218
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:44.730
And I'm star protecting him. I just hang up the phone because.

219
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.280
<v 0>I knew it was tapped. I.</v>

220
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:48.720
<v 1>Of course. And we, uh,</v>

221
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:53.310
we were forced to check into the

222
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.720
hotel who was owned by the Columbian army forces.

223
00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.810
So it was very clear that everything was stopped,

224
00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.420
that we have microphones all over the place.

225
00:14:03.421 --> 00:14:06.510
And he was the most wanted man in the world.

226
00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:12.030
And he really knew how to get out of the authorities

227
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:17.100
very easily. And that's why it was so hard to me to know, no,

228
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:21.720
we came that he was calling just to be traced and.

229
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.930
<v 0>Killed. So what was this last conversation about?</v>

230
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:27.750
<v 1>Well, we were talking about, um,</v>

231
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.500
an interview from a very well-known magazine in Columbia.

232
00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:36.240
He wanted to give me the answers and I was explaining to him,

233
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.480
I know all the answers. We spoke a lot.

234
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.110
You don't have to stay in the phone because you know, what's going to happen.

235
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:47.700
And I hang up, but he was kept calling and calling and calling.

236
00:14:47.701 --> 00:14:52.670
And that's why I understood that he was willing to

237
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:53.803
get killed.

238
00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:57.010
<v 0>You, uh, as you know,</v>

239
00:14:57.011 --> 00:15:01.870
the official version of what happened is that Pablo Escobar was shot

240
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.880
by the police while trying to escape.

241
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:09.280
<v 1>Well, we have more than one official version. If you ask the North Americans,</v>

242
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:12.790
they will tell you, we were the ones who killed powerless. Covar.

243
00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.520
And if you ask the Colombian police, they will tell you,

244
00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.770
we were the ones and you have your own opinion about this. I don't have opinion.

245
00:15:20.771 --> 00:15:21.820
I have proofs.

246
00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:26.590
I have evidence is different from opinions because I have

247
00:15:26.591 --> 00:15:28.570
the recordings of my father.

248
00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:33.010
He never talked too much in the telephone.

249
00:15:33.011 --> 00:15:35.530
So that's the first proof he had.

250
00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:37.690
<v 0>Thought he knew how to commit suicide.</v>

251
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:38.231
<v 1>Yes,</v>

252
00:15:38.231 --> 00:15:42.940
because we didn't want it to be tortured by the police.

253
00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:47.340
<v 0>And this is why you think that he committed suicide himself.</v>

254
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:47.850
<v 1>He, uh,</v>

255
00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:52.570
he taught me because he told me not to fire in his mouth or

256
00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:55.000
any of the part just in the right year.

257
00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:59.170
And it was the same place where the bullet appear.

258
00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.660
<v 0>What, what have you learned yourself?</v>

259
00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:06.700
<v 1>Well, I learned so much about violence that I became a man of peace,</v>

260
00:16:06.701 --> 00:16:11.170
you know, because I don't believe in violence. I know how it can,

261
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.400
you know, disappear a country, a whole country.

262
00:16:15.401 --> 00:16:18.340
It can change culture. It can change people,

263
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:23.890
money doesn't buy you happiness or freedom, even worse.

264
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.980
My father's money at the end,

265
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.220
he was for the financing, his own debt. You know? So it was,

266
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:38.210
we were hungry. We were dying financing because when,

267
00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.250
when my father died,

268
00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:44.350
the cartels approach to us and they told us we are going

269
00:16:44.351 --> 00:16:47.590
to recover all the money that we spent, uh,

270
00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.140
killing your father for this last 10 years.

271
00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:53.620
So we're going to take everything if you want to remember to say alive,

272
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:58.900
thank you. Take everything you have. I have, I don't. I just want to leave.

273
00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:00.310
I don't want anything.

274
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:03.640
<v 0>W after, after your father's death,</v>

275
00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:08.890
where are you seriously threatened? Did you feel like he was threatened?

276
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:13.390
<v 1>You're welcome. My, my health worth $4 million.</v>

277
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:18.070
I have to explain that nobody else's is paying that mad money now.

278
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.880
So nobody don't get very happy about that, because,

279
00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:26.290
so that was the price of your head. Yeah. That was the price. $4 million.

280
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.790
Just poor being the son of Pablo Escobar.

281
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:35.710
<v 0>Was that because people were afraid his enemies were afraid that you would</v>

282
00:17:35.711 --> 00:17:36.520
revenge.

283
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.500
<v 1>Yeah. They were very afraid of that.</v>

284
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:45.010
<v 0>Palm Pablo today, you live in Argentina. Yes. Uh,</v>

285
00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:49.470
you escaped, uh, from, from, uh, Columbia, after your dead,

286
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.290
you live in Argentina. You're an architect. I know. Yes.

287
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.180
<v 1>Also an industrial designer.</v>

288
00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:58.140
<v 0>And you have a wife and a kid.</v>

289
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.420
<v 1>Four year old kid. Yes.</v>

290
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.740
<v 0>And, uh, your mother, she is also there. What,</v>

291
00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.550
why don't you return to Columbia now? It's been so many years.

292
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.440
<v 1>Well,</v>

293
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:14.330
I have to wait 14 years since my father's death to say

294
00:18:14.331 --> 00:18:18.530
goodbye to him, because it's because of the threats. You know,

295
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.920
everybody was telling me if you ever came back, we will kill you.

296
00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:26.690
So I had to say in Argentina, I don't have, uh,

297
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:31.580
the option of returning to Columbia. That's not an option for me.

298
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.950
<v 0>Thank you so much for sharing your story with us tonight. Thanks. So you, um,</v>

299
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.070
on top of [inaudible].
