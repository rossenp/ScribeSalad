00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.840
<v 0>[Inaudible] a little</v>

2
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.333
slowly

3
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.130
[inaudible].

4
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.150
<v 1>Um, uh, I mean most when Leonore and Madeline speak,</v>

5
00:00:53.151 --> 00:00:55.340
especially about animals, if it's about, you know,

6
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.600
Heston Conine and then I get it more complicated than that. So.

7
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.000
<v 0>And or the meaning the rabbit, that's the, one of the first words.</v>

8
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.370
<v 1>Swedish, because that's his little thing.</v>

9
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.440
<v 2>You can't live without the Kennan</v>

10
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.660
special rabbit and she can't sleep without it. So it's, you know,

11
00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:18.080
if we don't find Kennan, then it's, we're not going to go to bed that night.

12
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.280
<v 1>Walked through Chelsea and she dropped it. We got home.</v>

13
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.450
We realized that it wasn't,

14
00:01:23.451 --> 00:01:27.380
that I spent two hours came back and forth across the streets.

15
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.530
I thought the they're turning the dustbin.

16
00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:34.700
I was looking in dustbins people thought I was crazy, but I had to find out.

17
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.050
<v 0>Terrible. And it's just, it's just clean and it doesn't go to name. It's just,</v>

18
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.500
just, can you just come in? Do you,

19
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.270
do you sing lullabies?

20
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.580
<v 2>Oh yes. All the time. Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.863
<v 0>What to do?</v>

22
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.840
<v 2>Yes, but I was so surprised that he didn't know that the blink, well,</v>

23
00:01:53.841 --> 00:01:58.670
you have it in Sweden. There you go. Hi, of course, Norwegians,

24
00:01:58.671 --> 00:01:59.504
you know.

25
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.190
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

26
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.023
<v 2>It was nice.</v>

27
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.720
<v 0>Probably we haven't seen the oil as well.</v>

28
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.180
I'm going to get lots of problems because

29
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.690
this is your lucky day in a way, because we have an inter speaking guests here,

30
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.280
so we need to do this in England.

31
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.060
Um, tell me, can you, uh,

32
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.670
can you recognize the fact that people get nervous around you

33
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.930
when you, when you went through a room as a, as a Royal person, can you,

34
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.230
can you sense that the people get sort of.

35
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.310
<v 2>Good, you know, sometimes, but I try to, you know,</v>

36
00:02:43.311 --> 00:02:46.400
smile and say hi and bring it back. That it's not, you know,

37
00:02:46.401 --> 00:02:47.390
I'm just a normal person.

38
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.340
<v 1>When she walks in the room. So.</v>

39
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.370
<v 0>[Inaudible] in the beginning, it must've been sort of awkward. I mean,</v>

40
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:03.910
coming into this very special family, uh,

41
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.870
being a civilian, uh, I mean,

42
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.300
it must be didn't you feel sort of,

43
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.300
uh, I mean, yeah.

44
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.730
<v 2>I think I would.</v>

45
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.610
<v 0>Be nervous meeting King and the queen for the first time.</v>

46
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.470
<v 1>Yeah, for sure. For sure. But you know what, in each of those circumstances,</v>

47
00:03:22.471 --> 00:03:26.160
they happened in unexpected way, so I wasn't fully prepared.

48
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.510
And so that took the edge off. Um, but, uh,

49
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.530
there's no how to book. There's no guide. There's no nothing.

50
00:03:34.531 --> 00:03:38.280
So you have to learn a little bit on, on the flow, but for sure,

51
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.350
you definitely a little nervous. Huh?

52
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.910
<v 0>How do you, if you, if you talk to the King, uh, your father-in-law,</v>

53
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.550
how do you address him Giza?

54
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.600
<v 1>You know, so yeah. She's mom. Yeah.</v>

55
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.030
<v 2>How did you meet, how did you get princess? How did she meet you?</v>

56
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.860
Tell me if you don't want it every day.

57
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.880
<v 1>Through mutual friends in New York.</v>

58
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.890
And we were basically living in a way kind of parallel lives. You know,

59
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.380
I kind of saw something that she didn't see something.

60
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.130
<v 2>No.</v>

61
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.270
<v 1>We, there was always chemistry. Laughter sense of humor.</v>

62
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.920
That's really the bond that I think most couples that have to

63
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.310
kind of, you know,

64
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.870
endure a long time or through some kind of focus or nervous tension,

65
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.140
that sense of humor to take everything a little bit with a pinch of salt that

66
00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:34.974
helps.

67
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.720
<v 2>You make me laugh everyday</v>

68
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.810
[inaudible] video. It was so beautiful your life and you guys, it was so nice.

69
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.690
<v 0>Meeting her for the first time. You were quite sure quite early. I mean,</v>

70
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.910
what did, what did you see?

71
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.060
<v 1>You know, I saw,</v>

72
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.050
I think in a way I think I read people well,

73
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.790
that's part of my jobs, what I've done. And with Madeline, you know, you,

74
00:05:04.791 --> 00:05:08.640
you see that big smile, you see those eyes and she's very outgoing.

75
00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:13.410
She's very honest, she's very forthcoming and sweet and welcoming.

76
00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:17.130
And she immediately cause people, as you say, nervous around her and so forth.

77
00:05:17.131 --> 00:05:20.940
And she's a spells that I necessarily wasn't nervous because we met in a private

78
00:05:20.941 --> 00:05:25.710
setting. And um, but yet you just see that gregariousness and it's,

79
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.900
it's a wonderful thing. So, you know.

80
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.120
<v 2>What did you say was Chris? Well, absolutely.</v>

81
00:05:33.121 --> 00:05:36.960
The sense of humor and you know, of course

82
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.100
[inaudible], Chris is a very, very, um, thoughtful person. He's very,

83
00:05:44.101 --> 00:05:49.080
very generous and you know, he's, he's a true gentleman and um,

84
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.150
yeah, how's it. How's he changed him? Yes, absolutely.

85
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.720
Um, I feel, he felt, he makes me feel very safe and uh,

86
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.870
I think, um, we are a good team together.

87
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.740
We like kind of the same things and it's quite easy.

88
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.640
<v 0>Have you changed it? I don't know for sure.</v>

89
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:14.463
For sure.

90
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.230
[inaudible].

91
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.840
<v 2>I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask my boyfriend that tonight.</v>

92
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.490
<v 0>[Inaudible] we all tried to change each other a bit. Don't we? I mean,</v>

93
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.210
perhaps the clothes, the style, the something that.

94
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.040
<v 2>Clothes, the style that I can't touch him. Hey, I see something. No, no, no, no,</v>

95
00:06:39.041 --> 00:06:41.950
this is, this is who I am. And that's what I like about Chris.

96
00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:46.210
He's very much about, you know, this is me, I'm Christian Neil, and you know,

97
00:06:46.211 --> 00:06:48.130
I'm not going to change. And I love that.

98
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.900
<v 0>How have you, have you been changed by a boyfriend since so fairy tale a lot,</v>

99
00:06:52.901 --> 00:06:53.734
by the way?

100
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.400
<v 2>No, no, man. You know,</v>

101
00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:59.560
my boyfriend's a bit older than we're quite a bit older than me.

102
00:06:59.561 --> 00:07:04.090
And actually I felt like for the first time in my life so far,

103
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:04.780
um,

104
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.050
that that's why our relationship works so much is because he already is who is

105
00:07:08.051 --> 00:07:11.380
going to be, but whereas anyone else I've ever been with isn't quite there yet,

106
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.510
so they're always changing a lot. Right. Um,

107
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.930
so I think the key to our success is that obviously we love each other,

108
00:07:16.931 --> 00:07:20.320
but I think our age group actually really works for me and my boyfriend,

109
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:24.100
but yeah, I've changed loads, but I think for the better it's,

110
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.700
it's amazing being a real team rather than being very separate.

111
00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:30.430
And when you argue rather than splitting up actually overcoming stuff,

112
00:07:30.431 --> 00:07:32.710
it makes you more powerful and that's so true.

113
00:07:32.711 --> 00:07:35.710
And especially now when you have children, it's, it's really being a team.

114
00:07:35.711 --> 00:07:37.600
You really have to be strong together. Yeah.

115
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.890
<v 0>You, you you're quite different people, aren't you? I mean.</v>

116
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.820
<v 2>Yes and no. I would say, uh,</v>

117
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.000
I'm definitely the one who's maybe a little bit more calmer and you can

118
00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:52.210
sometimes, you know, Chris is a very emotional guy.

119
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:58.180
<v 0>[Inaudible] the Irish, you know, there's obviously [inaudible] so you,</v>

120
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.640
you're more, more temperamental more. Absolutely.

121
00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.240
So, so how the whole time,

122
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.140
how do you deal with that? I mean, when he's in one of his mood.

123
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.110
<v 2>Well, you know, the one who deals best for is actually a or she just,</v>

124
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.820
she just looks at him and say, hi.

125
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:21.520
<v 0>Hi, just softens you in a second. Who's the most romantic of you?</v>

126
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.980
You are. Yeah.

127
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.910
[inaudible] in, in, in, in New York, in, in Stockholm.

128
00:08:33.911 --> 00:08:38.200
And now you live here in London, um, uh, w and you have two kids,

129
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:43.540
uh, and, um, so a lot has happened more or less say since you met,

130
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.950
uh, describe your, your life here in London, how is it?

131
00:08:47.951 --> 00:08:51.370
Do you live in a house or do you live in a flat or a w what kind of life is it?

132
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.790
<v 2>We, you know, we live in a very normal life right now.</v>

133
00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.880
I'm a full-time mom right now.

134
00:08:56.881 --> 00:09:01.230
And I enjoy spending most of my time with, with our little kids.

135
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:05.910
And, um, I mean, Chris, you work a lot, but when you're home,

136
00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:09.900
we try to do fun things together. And the weekends, we try to, you know,

137
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.460
go to this Sue, or we go to the local market and we find some nice, you know,

138
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.550
local vegetables.

139
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.950
I got a feeling. It might be he's pointing at him.

140
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:30.720
[inaudible] can you cut? No, actually,

141
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:35.730
I, I have to admit that I probably had never cooked a real meal for

142
00:09:35.731 --> 00:09:38.940
Chris. I'm a terrible housewife. Tell it.

143
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:43.220
<v 0>If you, if you had to cook something, what could that be?</v>

144
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.010
<v 2>Swedish meatballs.</v>

145
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.960
[inaudible] maybe we should get a little less than going on,

146
00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:58.610
but I'm the first one to sign up first and say, is it all right then English?

147
00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.550
[inaudible] no, for sure. I will jump on that.

148
00:10:04.551 --> 00:10:08.570
And I think Chris will be very happy if I do now, but Chris, I must say he's,

149
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:11.180
he's a very good chef. So, you know, I feel,

150
00:10:11.181 --> 00:10:14.720
I don't even want to go into the kitchen because he's kind of, this is my area,

151
00:10:14.721 --> 00:10:18.800
you know, you say, I tried to say, you know, darling,

152
00:10:18.801 --> 00:10:22.100
did you need any help? I can chop, no, no, no. You just make a mess.

153
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.020
And he's very good chef, you know?

154
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:31.970
<v 0>So, so what's your, what's your, uh, signature dish, if you, if you,</v>

155
00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.100
yeah. If you want to impress them.

156
00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.870
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. I think, um,</v>

157
00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:40.130
we liked like in the winter we like making like big soups,

158
00:10:40.131 --> 00:10:42.260
like a ribollita or a minestrone, you know,

159
00:10:42.261 --> 00:10:46.070
your minestrone recipe is always my default guide. Thank you very much.

160
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.030
Absolutely. But, you know, as we say, we go to the market, you,

161
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.920
I kind of grew up sometimes in, in, in, in, in the holidays, in Italy and my,

162
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:59.660
my father's mother came from Sicily and there it's, it's, it's, you know,

163
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.870
you let the ingredients speak for themselves, you know,

164
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.170
and you try not to temper with them. So you, you know,

165
00:11:06.171 --> 00:11:09.530
the way I kind of look at it is what you find guides you to what you're going to

166
00:11:09.531 --> 00:11:13.160
cook. And if you find a great chicken, you find a great bit of edge.

167
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.650
You let you just let them tell you what you're going to cook.

168
00:11:15.651 --> 00:11:17.270
And you just dictate it from that way. So,

169
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:19.850
but I like making different things different.

170
00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.620
<v 0>Do you remember the first meal you made here? That, that I cooked for her? Yeah.</v>

171
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.860
<v 1>Maybe my alley. All your spaghetti.</v>

172
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.960
<v 2>I think that's, you're kind of transpired to get all the questions. Very simple.</v>

173
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:35.143
Isn't it.

174
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.770
<v 1>Teeny, it's so simple, but you got to get it so right. To make it work.</v>

175
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.820
<v 0>So tell me about, uh, Leonore and Nicholas, uh,</v>

176
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:48.440
because we don't know them yet. Uh, and, um,

177
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.340
you've just started to know them because they're very, very young, uh,

178
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.960
can see their personality already.

179
00:11:57.060 --> 00:12:01.230
<v 2>Yes, I sing it. I mean, especially with Leonor, she, um, you know,</v>

180
00:12:01.231 --> 00:12:03.570
it's kind of funny because she, her name is actually,

181
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:08.870
it means sunlight or sunshine. And, and I must say since the day she was born,

182
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.400
she's always had a smile on her face. She always, you know,

183
00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:15.960
every day she makes us laugh and she's, she's really a fun little character.

184
00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:19.320
She's wild, she's everywhere, but you know.

185
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.213
<v 1>You are.</v>

186
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.580
And the worst part about it is she already knows that she has her father wrapped

187
00:12:23.581 --> 00:12:28.400
around her finger. So she's got it. Nicholas is,

188
00:12:28.401 --> 00:12:33.090
is, is a, is a gentle soul. He he's had a tough time. As of late,

189
00:12:33.091 --> 00:12:37.290
he had a little tummy bug, then he had fever and he's got a bit of a cough. So,

190
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:42.120
but even, so you come up to him and he looks at you and then you smile.

191
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.600
And then he smiles and it's all very gentle and very sweet.

192
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.170
She's more outgoing than he is, but you know, he's only six months.

193
00:12:49.171 --> 00:12:50.004
So we'll see.

194
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.810
<v 0>[Inaudible] are they like mini use, but just the opposite in a way.</v>

195
00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.660
<v 1>That's a good question. I don't know. I don't know.</v>

196
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.380
I think it's a good blend of each, for sure.

197
00:13:04.381 --> 00:13:07.350
There's lots of attributes from each of us in both of them. So.

198
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.820
<v 2>I can definitely see some positively annoyed in me, you know, kind of, yeah,</v>

199
00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.020
for sure. I was quite outgoing when I was a kid, I think, and, and, you know,

200
00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:17.790
stubborn as well. And she's.

201
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.250
<v 1>Well, you wait till they get older and you're arguing with them.</v>

202
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.820
And the bit that they're beating you, it is the bit that's you.

203
00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.240
<v 0>Just a minute faster than me.</v>

204
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.920
And also you become your own parents. I mean, slowly you become, you have, you,

205
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:38.430
have you noticed that, that you become like your own mother and you

206
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.330
kind of models out there and mother was.

207
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:47.970
<v 2>Um, that's a good question. I don't know. Really. Um,</v>

208
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:52.980
I think so in some way. Yeah, I think so. And I want, you know,

209
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:58.290
for me, uh, I feel that my, my parents there were so loving and, you know,

210
00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.140
the most generous people I know, uh, but you know,

211
00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:04.530
they were away a lot when we were kids, uh, due to their, you know,

212
00:14:04.531 --> 00:14:09.060
obligation as a queen King and queen. And, um, so I, I feel that,

213
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.800
that I really want to give my full time right now with my kids,

214
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:17.550
because that's the part that I, that I miss a little bit. Um, and,

215
00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:19.170
but otherwise, yeah.

216
00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:22.860
<v 1>And is that a generational thing? Is that, is that because that was the time?</v>

217
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:23.130
Yeah.

218
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.950
<v 2>I think so. Absolutely. I think our generation,</v>

219
00:14:25.951 --> 00:14:30.390
we are much more hands-on with the kids, especially the fathers. Um,

220
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:34.740
I think, you know, much more hands-on, I mean, you, you change,

221
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.540
I don't know how many diapers you change.

222
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.313
<v 0>Remind me.</v>

223
00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:44.730
<v 1>But yeah, but Madeline and, and, and, and Victoria as well, um, are,</v>

224
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.370
if I may say born mothers, I mean,

225
00:14:47.371 --> 00:14:51.650
it's incredible to watch them with their kids because it's,

226
00:14:51.651 --> 00:14:54.140
it's just so natural and I can see it in cut it up as well,

227
00:14:54.141 --> 00:14:57.500
because when he's with either ISTA, Leonora, you know, he,

228
00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:00.980
he just is on the floor and he's playing and wrestling with them.

229
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.620
And so all three really are,

230
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.610
are so warm and kind with the kids that is, is, is,

231
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.280
it's an amazing thing to see it in action.

232
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:16.210
<v 0>You, you were both, uh, where you are both, uh, the youngest. I mean, you,</v>

233
00:15:16.211 --> 00:15:20.980
you grew up with four sisters, uh, sorry, five sisters.

234
00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:25.770
Um, so I mean, you being the youngest, they,

235
00:15:25.771 --> 00:15:27.610
they had you in the trolley and just.

236
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:30.880
<v 1>No, I looked like Jagger when I was young, I had this like long hair.</v>

237
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:33.310
I had these like, always these hand-me-down coats,

238
00:15:33.311 --> 00:15:35.380
which was bizarre because I had to kind of like,

239
00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.550
and then they button the wrong way around. And it was all very strange,

240
00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:43.570
but of course, looking back in hindsight, well, my mother, they, yeah.

241
00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:47.680
And looking back, and it was like, you know, late seventies, early eighties,

242
00:15:47.681 --> 00:15:52.510
now it looks so cool at that point. It was horrendous. But, you know, um,

243
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:56.770
it was a wonderful thing growing up with a lot of sisters because they really,

244
00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.500
I think guide you and I'm, you know, I mean,

245
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.090
I think if women could rule the world,

246
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:05.080
the world would be in a lot better place than it is today. So, uh

247
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.840
[inaudible] and so I think that, you know,

248
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:17.680
having been with a lot of strong women in my life that that's only done any

249
00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:18.130
positives.

250
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:21.070
<v 0>I think so. Um, and, um,</v>

251
00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.700
are you shaped by being the, the, the, I mean the little sister,

252
00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.920
do you think that has shaped who you are?

253
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:33.490
<v 2>Yes. That's no families I'm sure. Um, you know, having, you know, my,</v>

254
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.910
my sister because of parents were gone quite a lot, you know, make my sister,

255
00:16:36.911 --> 00:16:40.960
she really took on that role of being the oldest sister. She,

256
00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.510
she taught us a lot of things early stage,

257
00:16:43.511 --> 00:16:48.040
and she always came up with fun plays. And my brother,

258
00:16:48.041 --> 00:16:50.920
he was kind of in between these strong sisters. So,

259
00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:53.800
which usually that happens with the middle child.

260
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.540
<v 0>Yeah. And you're still very close with your brothers.</v>

261
00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.380
<v 2>And like when you mentioned the stele and my sister,</v>

262
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.910
it's so much fun nowadays, you know, when we spend our summer in, uh,

263
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.670
in an Island called Irlen in South part of Sweden,

264
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:14.680
and it was so much fun this summer too, to see that, you know, my sister and I,

265
00:17:14.681 --> 00:17:17.500
we were doing the same things that we've always done when we were kids,

266
00:17:17.501 --> 00:17:20.530
but now with our two daughters and, you know, we,

267
00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:24.640
we start off the day and we would go and we pick the eggs from the chickens and

268
00:17:24.641 --> 00:17:26.290
they would go to the, you know,

269
00:17:26.291 --> 00:17:29.620
strawberry land and we'd some strawberries and then we'd go riding and,

270
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.920
and now we're doing with our daughters. And it's it really fun.

271
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:37.780
<v 0>You, you, you, uh, you grew up in the limelight, uh, and,</v>

272
00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:42.970
um, I don't know what, what's your memories like, uh,

273
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.560
from that, I mean, being a child, uh, and so much,

274
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:52.560
uh, watched by anyone, every move move you made, was that a,

275
00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.740
is that a positive memory or is it a tough memory for you?

276
00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.950
<v 2>You know, I was poor. My parents always got a headache when we were, you know,</v>

277
00:18:00.951 --> 00:18:02.180
having, you know,

278
00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.960
family photos or something like that because I always run off and I was always

279
00:18:05.961 --> 00:18:09.860
hiding and they always had to drag me there and I was screaming and I never

280
00:18:09.861 --> 00:18:13.460
really want to be a part of it. And, um, you know, one,

281
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.620
one could sing that I've had this all my life. And, um,

282
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:22.490
one was thinking, what would maybe expect that I would be used to that by now,

283
00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.740
uh, to be comfortable, you know,

284
00:18:24.741 --> 00:18:29.270
in front of people or with photographers or journalists asking you a question,

285
00:18:29.271 --> 00:18:33.680
but I'm really not. I'm I'm, I think in the end of the day, I'm,

286
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.930
I'm quite shy. And, um,

287
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:41.180
I don't like being in the center of attention, but, you know, as,

288
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.710
as an official person, as I am,

289
00:18:42.711 --> 00:18:45.770
I know that this is something I have to deal with and, um,

290
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:49.880
I'm struggling with it. I'm working on it. And I'm here today.

291
00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:59.630
<v 0>[Inaudible] in what way, when you read about her,</v>

292
00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:01.000
when you've been criticism more?

293
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:05.630
<v 1>Oh, absolutely. Sure. Of course. I'm her husband. So, you know, for me,</v>

294
00:19:05.631 --> 00:19:07.250
I'm very protective and, uh,

295
00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:11.930
I know also that the people writing things, you know,

296
00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:16.310
don't know who we are, you know, they've never met us. We might pretend they do,

297
00:19:16.311 --> 00:19:18.680
but they've never spent time with us. They've never hung out with us.

298
00:19:18.681 --> 00:19:23.450
So they may say things that kind of justify their own

299
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:26.980
means, but aren't really, you know, true. And you, you,

300
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.030
you get a thicker skin over time, you learn it and you, you,

301
00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.920
you get to deal with it, but it's always a little painful for sure.

302
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:37.550
<v 2>You'll have to find a balance because I mean, as we all know,</v>

303
00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:41.000
media is important and, uh, and, uh,

304
00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.220
finding a balance.

305
00:19:43.221 --> 00:19:47.480
And of course it saddens me sometimes when media might think that I'm

306
00:19:47.481 --> 00:19:51.200
arrogant or, you know, because I'm not answering their questions, but it's,

307
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:54.730
that's really not, that's really not the case. It's not who I am. And,

308
00:19:54.731 --> 00:19:59.660
and of course that, that upsets me sometimes. Um, but,

309
00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:01.670
um, yeah, we.

310
00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:07.160
<v 0>Did. Did it ever happen that you thought, Oh, I wish she was not a princess.</v>

311
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.990
<v 1>Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Because, you know,</v>

312
00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:16.040
there were times when, you know, it's, it's interesting, um,

313
00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:20.390
in England, in this country and, and, and kind of the Anglo-Saxon model,

314
00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.210
we take privacy as a sacrosanct. You know,

315
00:20:23.211 --> 00:20:28.100
it is God given right to certain things in one's life, private, um,

316
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:29.210
and you know,

317
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:33.020
it's not better or worse than a Scandinavian model where everything is very much

318
00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:36.560
transparent and shared. It's very different. And in, in hindsight,

319
00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:40.190
I was not aware of that and I was not prepared for that in a way.

320
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.660
So at some point I would have been like, Ooh, I love the skull.

321
00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:48.670
And they fell in love with the skull. And I have to now, you know,

322
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:53.800
very much adapt my entire life towards who I fell in love with.

323
00:20:53.801 --> 00:20:57.400
And there were times of course, when it wasn't so comfortable that you said, Oh,

324
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:02.050
I wish I didn't have to do this. They are little minute times. And you know,

325
00:21:02.051 --> 00:21:02.884
it doesn't matter.

326
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.580
<v 0>You, you have declined Royal privileges. I mean,</v>

327
00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.750
you ha you haven't got the title. Uh, have you ever considered the same?

328
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.560
<v 2>You know, I feel that like, Chris, would,</v>

329
00:21:13.561 --> 00:21:17.580
you said in that if I can, through my title, you know,

330
00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:22.920
point on important issues that I really think it's important

331
00:21:22.921 --> 00:21:27.480
that we talk about, you know, for example, children's rights. Um, I will,

332
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.710
you know, I happily want to do that and if I can make a difference by just,

333
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:34.680
you know, raising the awareness about sexual abuse of children,

334
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:38.760
this is something we need to talk about. It's so important. And then I'm, I'm,

335
00:21:38.761 --> 00:21:40.560
I'm proud of being a princess.

336
00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:42.540
<v 0>This is, this is, uh,</v>

337
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:47.010
your mother's foundation that you now work with. Uh,

338
00:21:47.011 --> 00:21:50.460
it's called childhood. Um, tell me,

339
00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:55.080
w I mean, you've been involved in a lot of projects. Um,

340
00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:59.730
what, what has made the strongest personal impression on you?

341
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:06.060
<v 2>Oh, that's a tough question. Um, you know, w with childhood, um, and the,</v>

342
00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.850
for those of you who don't know, it's, um, it's about the,

343
00:22:08.851 --> 00:22:13.080
we support the most vulnerable children as three children, children,

344
00:22:13.081 --> 00:22:17.130
and lives in alternative care, uh, families at risk. And of course,

345
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:20.580
children has been sexually abused. And, you know, my mom,

346
00:22:20.581 --> 00:22:23.910
when she founded Charlotte, uh, she found that she saw the,

347
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.060
nobody talked about this group of kids. It was,

348
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:30.780
it was so taboo and people didn't know really how to talk about it.

349
00:22:30.781 --> 00:22:35.580
And I think it's still difficult for people. I noticed that some,

350
00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:39.390
you know, they tune off a little bit when I start talking about it. But, um,

351
00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.930
again, it's so important that we do address this problem,

352
00:22:42.931 --> 00:22:45.060
because there are millions,

353
00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.600
I think it's over 200 million of children out there who are being sexually

354
00:22:48.601 --> 00:22:51.180
abused. And, um, you know,

355
00:22:51.181 --> 00:22:55.830
only in the U S I think one of 10 children are being

356
00:22:55.831 --> 00:22:56.664
abused before the,

357
00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:00.990
at T 85% of these kids are 11 years or younger.

358
00:23:00.991 --> 00:23:02.400
So for me,

359
00:23:02.401 --> 00:23:06.870
knowing that there's so many kids out there who are sexually abused and

360
00:23:06.871 --> 00:23:07.650
exploited,

361
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:12.030
and it makes me even more determined that we have to do something about it,

362
00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:13.140
and we can do.

363
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:21.630
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

364
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:24.720
<v 0>The role of a modern princess, uh, um, um, the,</v>

365
00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:29.490
the press criticizing, you will interpret it differently.

366
00:23:29.491 --> 00:23:32.190
They would interpret that you should also be available to,

367
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:36.230
to the brands to cut more readers. Yes, that's exactly.

368
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:40.080
<v 2>No, I, and I understand it. And, um, I'm, I,</v>

369
00:23:40.081 --> 00:23:44.640
I absolutely think I should do. I can do both. And I see myself, you know,

370
00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:48.800
now living here in England, um, I feel that I could do much,

371
00:23:48.801 --> 00:23:52.640
much more for Sweden abroad. Uh, I can promote, you know,

372
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:57.230
Swedish companies, a huge market here in, in UK. And I think we are,

373
00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.690
we're 50,000 suites living in London.

374
00:23:59.691 --> 00:24:01.460
So there are a lot of things I can do here.

375
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.980
<v 0>So what you're saying, you could do more.</v>

376
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:07.520
<v 2>Absolutely. She's being a full-time mom. That's better. There'd been a princess,</v>

377
00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:08.354
in my opinion.

378
00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.920
<v 0>[Inaudible] do you have any, even though you haven't got a title,</v>

379
00:24:17.921 --> 00:24:22.510
do you have any limitations as a business man in your business? I mean, you're,

380
00:24:22.511 --> 00:24:26.590
you're a businessman, you're an investor. Do you, do you feel that your,

381
00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:31.390
this role being her husband gives you some limitations?

382
00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.160
<v 1>It did in my previous job.</v>

383
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:35.770
And that's part of the reason that a small part of the reason why I left that

384
00:24:35.771 --> 00:24:37.630
job, because the, uh,

385
00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:42.550
we were managing capital on behalf of clients and they

386
00:24:42.551 --> 00:24:45.970
weren't comfortable in the, kind of the intrusion of, of, uh,

387
00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.370
of the press into my life. Um,

388
00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:53.170
and so now I've had to adapt what I do in so far that it's really

389
00:24:53.171 --> 00:24:56.770
business to business type of, um, um, business.

390
00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:01.600
And therefore you're speaking to large institutions, they're multinationals,

391
00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:05.410
um, outside of certain geographic markets. Um,

392
00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:09.880
they don't know who I am at all. So, you know, it, it doesn't really come into,

393
00:25:09.881 --> 00:25:12.580
I don't think it's really ever come up in,

394
00:25:12.581 --> 00:25:15.400
in what I've been doing for the last three or four years, um,

395
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:18.130
who I am or what I do. So that, that's the plus side of it.

396
00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.680
<v 0>W w what is it you do really? I mean, you know.</v>

397
00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:22.750
<v 1>That's a good question.</v>

398
00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:26.530
So I sat behind four computer screens for like 20 years of my life.

399
00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:30.670
I was just trading. And while I was okay at what I did,

400
00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.350
and I liked what I did, and I enjoyed it,

401
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:34.660
it was time for me to not do that anymore.

402
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:39.490
And so I basically spent a lot of my time focusing on two industries,

403
00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:42.370
MoMA's payment processing, and one was energy.

404
00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:47.710
And now I've identified two opportunities in those two industries

405
00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:52.870
that I am trying to explain and, and make some business from. Uh,

406
00:25:52.871 --> 00:25:56.560
these are long-term contracts dealing with very, very big companies.

407
00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.590
And so, uh, it takes time to end them.

408
00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:03.190
It's very frustrating sometimes because you're, you, you know,

409
00:26:03.191 --> 00:26:07.000
you have a solution that would really fix problems that they have. Um,

410
00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:10.330
but you know, trying to make a Titanic move takes time.

411
00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:14.800
<v 0>Okay. Um, before, before we wrap up tonight,</v>

412
00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:19.680
I liked what I did now. Sorry. I really, that was, that was,

413
00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:24.540
that was a couple of things, because you're here, you had not,

414
00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:28.720
not the problem, but you have one here, down there. She was like,

415
00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:35.100
[inaudible],

416
00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:39.100
let's talk about the future because many people wonder what's going to happen.

417
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:43.790
Uh, I mean, how long are you staying in England? You you've been as I living in,

418
00:26:43.791 --> 00:26:47.940
in, in New York, in, in Stockholm for, for a bit. And, uh, now in London,

419
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.870
are you, are you staying here forever or what's the plan?

420
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:58.520
<v 2>I don't know. I really, we're looking at each other. Um, you know,</v>

421
00:26:58.521 --> 00:27:02.630
right now it's a very good place for us to be, uh, because of Chris,

422
00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.110
your business. Uh, and, you know, I find London,

423
00:27:06.111 --> 00:27:10.580
it's a perfect place because it's, it's close to home, uh,

424
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:14.960
to my family. And then my friend. So it's easy for me to pop over whenever. Um,

425
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:18.940
New York was a little bit far away. I'm sure you've maybe felt the same thing,

426
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:22.610
having family here. Uh, so.

427
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:26.660
<v 0>Do you, do you have a, do you have a, like a Scandinavian home here,</v>

428
00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:29.900
or do you have, have you gone totally British with the, you know,

429
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:31.610
carpet on the bathroom floor and everything?

430
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:35.480
<v 2>That's the thing I don't really understand.</v>

431
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:40.790
<v 3>We like white clean surfaces.</v>

432
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:46.370
It's probably thanks to our care anyway. Really.

433
00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:49.610
It probably was all carpets in the eighties.

434
00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:53.540
<v 2>No, I think we have a mix day. Yeah.</v>

435
00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.840
<v 0>Leonora is, is starting school when she's six years old, what,</v>

436
00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:01.820
what do you think? I mean, what should be, do, do you have.

437
00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:07.550
<v 1>Six years is a, is four years from now. So, you know, what we do is we,</v>

438
00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:10.880
we, we lay out different, you know,

439
00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:15.140
kind of alternative options and we preregistered and do all the things that one

440
00:28:15.141 --> 00:28:18.620
has to do and had spreadsheets come out. I mean, in this country, I mean,

441
00:28:18.621 --> 00:28:22.370
it's incredible, you know, I've had, I've had schools say, no,

442
00:28:22.371 --> 00:28:26.270
you're on the wait list because you should have phone 24 hours after birth,

443
00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:27.560
you know?

444
00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.680
<v 2>Well, when I was pregnant, I should have done it. But when I had it,</v>

445
00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.520
when I was pregnant, bearing in mind,

446
00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:34.460
the artists went to the local school around the corner is revelation to me,

447
00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:37.100
all that, not putting their names, then I've even got a name.

448
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.903
<v 3>Next month.</v>

449
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:45.290
<v 1>You know, we, we, what we've done is we've said, look, let's,</v>

450
00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:49.940
let's consider every eventuality plan accordingly and take it as,

451
00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.110
as it comes. Yeah.

452
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:53.210
<v 2>I think it was a portrait also, see, you know, what's,</v>

453
00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:57.110
what's best for the kids and the end of the day and, and take it from there.

454
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:58.063
Yeah.

455
00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:02.480
<v 0>Uh, near future Christmas coming up. Uh, how do you plan to celebrate Christmas?</v>

456
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:06.530
<v 2>We are actually celebrating Christmas here with Chris family.</v>

457
00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:12.470
<v 0>I see. When stocking and everything, or do you do stockings? I don't know.</v>

458
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:14.680
<v 1>We're weird in our family. We,</v>

459
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:19.310
we celebrate on the 24th because my mother and the Germanic side of us.

460
00:29:19.311 --> 00:29:23.690
So we actually do it more kind of in a German style. Um,

461
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:26.750
so we don't have stockings. We have Christmas trees and things like this,

462
00:29:26.751 --> 00:29:30.980
but obviously, but we celebrate on the 24th and, um,

463
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:34.640
but we're going to be in Sweden for most of December. And then we come back.

464
00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:38.720
<v 2>I'm sure we will enjoy a little bit of a Swedish. You called the class.</v>

465
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:42.040
Did you have a youth board? Do you know where that is? You.

466
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.240
<v 0>Know, smokers? I'm sure</v>

467
00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:48.910
food is something that's very difficult. Lots of people,

468
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:53.770
lots of [inaudible] sausages and lots of the herrings.

469
00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.590
And what else do we have that

470
00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.860
little bit weirder things going on?

471
00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:08.340
<v 2>I think we're spending it here. I'm in England and yeah, Turkey.</v>

472
00:30:08.341 --> 00:30:11.580
I make a really good Brussels sprout Baton because I hate Brussels sprouts.

473
00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:13.260
Yeah. It's for the double cream though. Jamie

474
00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:18.990
[inaudible] understanding where I can eat 'em um, and I tend to make, um,

475
00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.470
like a blueberry sort of pie thing. So yeah.

476
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.110
Large chocolate for like 16 people in the Turkey didn't fit in the oven.

477
00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.450
I'd sit with your back against the oven. It was a nightmare.

478
00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:39.150
<v 0>[Inaudible] yes. Yes. Thank you so much for being a real pleasure to meet you.</v>

479
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:52.350
[inaudible].
