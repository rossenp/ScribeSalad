00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v 0>These won't come</v>

2
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.900
[inaudible], you're here with Greenpeace. You're in Scandinavia with Greenpeace

3
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.990
[inaudible] and the thing is that you've been working a lot with them.

4
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.380
You've been traveling with them, uh, and you've been twice, I think,

5
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.990
in the Arctic, uh, on the boat. Yeah. Uh, how,

6
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.010
how do you fit in there? How do you, I mean, how is it, how do you, um,

7
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.983
London with the crew.

8
00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.991
<v 1>Climate change,</v>

9
00:00:59.991 --> 00:01:03.590
I think is the pointed end of what's good of our problems at the moment.

10
00:01:03.591 --> 00:01:08.390
And we've really got to get, we've got to act so fast to stop it from,

11
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.880
um, from reaching, you know, two degrees.

12
00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:15.230
So I joined Greenpeace to really go and see for myself, you know?

13
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.880
Um, and I, the thing is, it was the first time that as an organization,

14
00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:23.120
they'd really taken a breath.

15
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.020
I'm sorry to even use that word, but she's so offensive,

16
00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:31.370
but this first time they'd taken an actor, you know? And, um, so I thought,

17
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.190
I think, well, I knew as soon as I got on the boat,

18
00:01:34.191 --> 00:01:37.730
I took one look at their faces and I knew they were just thinking, Oh God.

19
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.683
<v 0>Awesome.</v>

20
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.080
<v 1>[Inaudible] 14 year old daughter. We got to put up with that.</v>

21
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:49.130
And they're all rugged men and women of the sea, you know, they're not,

22
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.350
you know, I mean.

23
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.590
<v 0>Do you know what I mean? I mean that</v>

24
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.340
they're all covered in oil.

25
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.310
<v 1>That's a lot of chains. And anyway, um, it's very sexy actually. Um,</v>

26
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.530
but, but the captain of the boat, who's Russian leather mirror.

27
00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:13.460
When I come on board, he said, um, you, you can, uh,

28
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.110
you can clean the toilets. So I said,

29
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.740
okay. I said, doll, you're on.

30
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.810
And I clean those toilets every morning with such a passion. You know,

31
00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:30.080
that by the end of it, they all said, you know what? This has been great,

32
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:34.100
but our toilets will never be the same again, you know, it's, uh, it was, um,

33
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.770
it took me two weeks to break them down. Do you know what I mean?

34
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.480
But we got there in the end, extraordinary people, you know, all of them,

35
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.710
great activists, people who go off on six months on these boats, you know,

36
00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:50.480
and they really know their stuff. You have to be a sea person.

37
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.600
It's very impressive. I love this organization.

38
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.500
<v 0>Uh, due date. Do they, I mean, are there any perks for them,</v>

39
00:02:57.501 --> 00:03:00.160
for the crew to have a movie star board or.

40
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.320
<v 1>No, not really. No. Well, I mean, you know,</v>

41
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.430
I tend to do,

42
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:09.880
I do a sketch show at the end where I do do them each one and actually on the

43
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:13.750
last tour, we had an Argentinian first mate and, um,

44
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.000
called nacho who's for some reason or other kept on playing Rocky

45
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.570
music. And that he was a great fan of Sylvester Stallone,

46
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:24.750
which was slightly unexpected. This was,

47
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.720
of course the versus alone is a very right-wing and, um,

48
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.910
a trumps anyway. So I happen to know him. So,

49
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.840
um, yeah, so the end of the tour, I rang him and said,

50
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:41.080
would you please send me a little video message for my friend nacho?

51
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.140
So he turned this and he,

52
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.730
I've never seen a big burly bloke who could, you know,

53
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.250
barely look at me. I mean, it was,

54
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.200
he fell to his knees and cloth my ankle,

55
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.570
and then sent it to about a million people in Argentina. It was very funny.

56
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.550
So that was, I suppose, that that's more as a perk. Yeah. It just one.

57
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.410
<v 0>Uh, so this, this alone is not the only, um,</v>

58
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.600
only right-wing man with success to put it that way. I mean, you have now,

59
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.790
uh, one climate skeptic, uh, in the, in the white house.

60
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:26.100
So it it's going really well for, let's say your opposition these days. Yeah.

61
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.810
<v 1>Don't forget in the white house,</v>

62
00:04:27.811 --> 00:04:31.560
there's quite a lot of division already cause Ivanka and Tillison have both come

63
00:04:31.561 --> 00:04:35.760
out and said, we can't miss the Paris agreements. You know, so this is good,

64
00:04:35.761 --> 00:04:39.060
but actually one of the reasons that I'm here particularly in Scandinavia is

65
00:04:39.061 --> 00:04:43.680
because there's something very interesting going on in Norway because

66
00:04:43.681 --> 00:04:47.610
Norway it's always, always, always been a kind of green beacon for me. You know,

67
00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:52.590
it's a great that they've done so much for green climate change against climate

68
00:04:52.591 --> 00:04:53.424
change,

69
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.360
cleaning up their act before anybody else I've always had great admiration for

70
00:04:57.361 --> 00:05:00.780
the country. And in 2014,

71
00:05:00.781 --> 00:05:03.090
they wrote into their constitution,

72
00:05:03.091 --> 00:05:07.170
a new article and it's so beautifully written.

73
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.520
And it's about the protection of the environment for future generations.

74
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.530
And it is it's wonderful.

75
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.410
Were there very few countries in the world who have such a thing in their

76
00:05:16.411 --> 00:05:20.070
constitution? So it's new and it's, it's fabulous.

77
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.750
So they put this in to the constitution and then went to the Paris agreement,

78
00:05:24.751 --> 00:05:25.584
signed. It,

79
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.450
came back and handed a new oil drilling

80
00:05:30.451 --> 00:05:32.790
license to start off.

81
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.240
So there's a whole new oil frontier in Norway.

82
00:05:36.241 --> 00:05:40.170
So they sort of did one thing with one hand. This is the Norwegian government.

83
00:05:40.171 --> 00:05:43.050
I'm sure the Norwegian people would be very much against it if they knew really

84
00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:48.030
what it entailed, what it meant for our people, for the planet,

85
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.960
but doing another thing with the other hand, I think it's a very immoral act.

86
00:05:51.961 --> 00:05:55.830
And I think it's probably having put that article into the constitution.

87
00:05:55.831 --> 00:06:00.590
I think it's probably illegal. So Greenpeace are taking, um, with another, um,

88
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.850
organization, um,

89
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.080
are taking the Norwegian government to court and also district court in

90
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:09.110
November. But now we've got Trump. He is,

91
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:11.690
my mother calls him in the white house. She's 84.

92
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:14.810
She comes in and every night to have her glass of wine. And she says,

93
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.640
have you heard what Trump has done today? And I say, mom,

94
00:06:18.641 --> 00:06:22.090
don't be so excited about it. It's not good news. She says, I'm 84.

95
00:06:22.091 --> 00:06:26.830
It's not going to affect me. So we don't have a.

96
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.670
<v 0>Way here or Norwegian government at least, uh, to, to,</v>

97
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.410
to sort of defend themselves. Uh, they will in court, uh, I guess,

98
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.200
uh, but, uh, we don't have Trump either, but let's say, I mean,

99
00:06:41.201 --> 00:06:44.980
he watches a lot of television and let's say he helps me out once

100
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:46.750
Donald Trump. Yeah.

101
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.343
<v 1>You want to hear it?</v>

102
00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.430
[inaudible] let me do well. Okay. I'll tell you the story. It's very funny.

103
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.140
I was doing, um,

104
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.480
primary colors drawn to Volta in Hollywood and, um,

105
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.010
I was in my trailer and it was on the universal lot and my,

106
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.720
I had just been divorced and my decree Nissan decree absolute had just come

107
00:07:16.721 --> 00:07:20.050
through like the day before, which was no big deal. It was just anyway.

108
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.690
So the phone rings in my trailer,

109
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.170
which has never done before I looked at it and it's like, weird.

110
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.590
It's like a moose has just entered my trailer. I'm just,

111
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:34.270
what are you doing anyway? So I left on the phone. Hi, it's Donald Trump here.

112
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:39.580
I said, really well, can I help you?

113
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.570
He said, yeah, I just, you know,

114
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.040
I wondered if I could for you some accommodation. And one of my Trump towers,

115
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:51.220
they're really comfortable. And I said,

116
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:56.020
why are you offering me somewhere to stay in my trailer?

117
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.890
I don't what, well, you know, I think we will get on very well.

118
00:07:59.891 --> 00:08:01.870
Maybe we could have dinner sometime.

119
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:07.090
I didn't know what to do with myself. I was absolutely. I was on my own.

120
00:08:07.091 --> 00:08:10.040
And I just said, okay, well, I'll get back to,

121
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.273
uh,

122
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.670
[inaudible] never met him before. I'd never met him.

123
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:29.080
Never met him since I've never met him since. Or you didn't, you didn't do this.

124
00:08:29.081 --> 00:08:29.914
You didn't meet.

125
00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.500
You could be the first lady. Yes

126
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:45.310
[inaudible]. Do you know what I did think about afterwards? I thought,

127
00:08:45.311 --> 00:08:49.630
I wonder if he's got a kind of list of people who were about to be properly

128
00:08:49.631 --> 00:08:51.730
divorced, like, you know,

129
00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:55.090
a list of people who might look good on his arm or might give a little bit

130
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.580
something, you know, to the Trump brand. I just wondered whether,

131
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.550
because it was just so weird. Did you ever.

132
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:06.590
<v 0>That's an explanation how your number get the number in the trailer?</v>

133
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:09.463
<v 1>Universals.</v>

134
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.660
<v 0>[Inaudible] but he could have been a liberal,</v>

135
00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:21.200
he could have turned them around the history of the world.

136
00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.560
<v 1>I hate when that happens,</v>

137
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.730
when you had an opportunity to change the whole history of the world and you

138
00:09:28.731 --> 00:09:29.564
just missed it.

139
00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:37.400
<v 0>Yeah. And like you, you have, you kind of always been an activist through your,</v>

140
00:09:37.401 --> 00:09:39.860
through your life. Uh, what triggered that?

141
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:45.800
<v 1>Well, I was doing standup comedy, um, you know, like in C and D marches.</v>

142
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.780
<v 0>Oh no. [inaudible].</v>

143
00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:52.160
<v 1>Yeah, a lot of comedians in my country.</v>

144
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.280
There's this thing called alternative comedians in the city.

145
00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:59.620
You remember in the seventies and eighties? Yeah,

146
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:04.580
because you were about 12 aren't you you're very young. Yes,

147
00:10:04.581 --> 00:10:06.590
it is. It is a compliment. It really is.

148
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.990
But I'm sort of in the seventies and eighties,

149
00:10:08.991 --> 00:10:12.800
we had the alternative comedians who were all very, um,

150
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.910
they were kind of prophetic, actually a lot of them, um, about what,

151
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.150
what was going to happen politically. Um,

152
00:10:20.151 --> 00:10:24.620
and the labor party and the left were full of comedians doing their shtick.

153
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.040
And, um, I did a little bit of that, um, before I became a Knight.

154
00:10:28.041 --> 00:10:32.170
So I didn't start acting until I was 27. And, um, and so I,

155
00:10:32.171 --> 00:10:34.160
I talked to a lot of comedians,

156
00:10:34.161 --> 00:10:38.750
so it was through there that prison. And like you say,

157
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:39.890
they have a kind of Tourette's,

158
00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:44.960
they just say stuff and they see it because comedians are so

159
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.790
clever. I mean, not you obviously, but, but they are,

160
00:10:49.791 --> 00:10:52.220
they're really, they're always so bright.

161
00:10:52.221 --> 00:10:54.350
And they're always thinking about things in a different way.

162
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:58.550
<v 0>First of all, what if you, I mean, working as a standup comedian, what was,</v>

163
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.980
what was the, the joke that worked best for you?

164
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.850
What was the killer joke for you? Do you remember?

165
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:09.230
<v 1>I do, um, this, this joke,</v>

166
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.470
generally speaking, worked quite well. And it was about, um,

167
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:17.090
the fact that my boyfriend had come back from

168
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.320
some holiday or rather, and gave me an STD,

169
00:11:21.321 --> 00:11:25.640
which is called thrush, which is, um, candida, you know,

170
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:30.260
and then down there, it's something it's a woman's problem. Yeah. Yeah.

171
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.200
This is cool. You get it in your vagina

172
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.580
down that it's in your vagina.

173
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:44.240
It sees a kind of bird as well, but it's not the birds.

174
00:11:44.241 --> 00:11:45.350
That would be really young.

175
00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.250
<v 0>You want to give you that?</v>

176
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:53.740
<v 1>Right? Well, that's the whole other thing anyway, this not the joke.</v>

177
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:57.700
The joke was that. And you might not, I don't know whether you even hunted this,

178
00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.290
but in those days you would treat this disease with

179
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:06.490
plain yogurt, live yogurt, because the bacillus, you,

180
00:12:06.491 --> 00:12:08.830
you can have this joke for your act

181
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.730
because you do real jokes about real things. And this is,

182
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.840
[inaudible] heard this, uh, Oh yeah, that's true. But, um, anyway, it's so good.

183
00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:23.920
It's just so not funny now, plain yogurt.

184
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:28.570
So you would do per tampon into plain yogurt and push it up your vagina.

185
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.770
And this would make, this would balance the healer candidate.

186
00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:36.820
So I had sent a friend out to get some yogurt and he'd come back with tropical

187
00:12:36.821 --> 00:12:37.690
fruit and nut flavor.

188
00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.070
<v 0>[Inaudible], didn't move to Hollywood. Although you have the,</v>

189
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:54.780
you have a huge career there, you have two Oscars, five nominations, right?

190
00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:57.870
But you never moved there. No. Why not?

191
00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:03.270
<v 1>Cause I CA I couldn't. Can you imagine? I mean,</v>

192
00:13:03.271 --> 00:13:05.490
every time I have to go to Los Angeles, I think, Oh God,

193
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.070
I'm too fat to go there. That I'm not going to, they're not going to let me in.

194
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:13.260
Hello. You're Emma Thompson. You can't come in. You're too fat.

195
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.620
Now look at you. You're fat and you're old.

196
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.520
Are you trying to hide the fact that you're old? Well, you're not.

197
00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.430
You're all in your fat go home. I mean,

198
00:13:23.431 --> 00:13:27.930
I really like feel LA is so mad. And so, um,

199
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.900
so hostile to, you know, that actually,

200
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.180
it's not true when I go there. They're always very nice to me.

201
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:41.220
I'm really just doing a gag, but at the same time, at the same time,

202
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:46.230
it is a very strange place. And, um, it, it, I couldn't live there.

203
00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:49.590
I could live here. I loved it.

204
00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.350
<v 0>[Inaudible] or, uh, of, of, uh, Hollywood.</v>

205
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.140
<v 1>It's not only in Hong Kong all over the place. In fact,</v>

206
00:14:04.141 --> 00:14:07.080
you know what I want to do? We lose it with me. So we want,

207
00:14:07.081 --> 00:14:11.340
we should bring out a pro aging, cream, everything on it.

208
00:14:11.341 --> 00:14:15.990
It's just written anti aging, anti aging, what is wrong with us?

209
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.410
We are all going to get older.

210
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.980
Why are we doing this anti aging? These like, yes.

211
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:28.230
And climate change. I get that. But why would you,

212
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.840
it's everywhere for men, for women.

213
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:36.300
<v 2>I even got a question from one of your journalists from England.</v>

214
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.070
She asked me once, how come you're not as thin as other actresses?

215
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:46.800
And I was just so shocked. I just said, Oh, I,

216
00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:49.170
I just think that's a boring question,

217
00:14:49.171 --> 00:14:52.160
but what I really wanted to say that I thought.

218
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.530
<v 1>About later, I want you to say, Oh,</v>

219
00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.380
I think wondering about that.

220
00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.980
Why are everybody in the American movies I listened

221
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.870
to? I had no idea. I said the same thing to another one. I said,

222
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:13.010
did story, do you want me to be an actress or a mobile? Yeah. What do you want?

223
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:17.390
And also the anorexia, there's so many kids,

224
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.600
girls and boys now, and actresses who were very,

225
00:15:20.601 --> 00:15:24.380
very thin who were into their thirties, simply don't eat.

226
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:27.680
They don't eat. So if

227
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.540
it's such a huge subject, isn't it really should do the next,

228
00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:34.040
your next big documentary on it.

229
00:15:34.041 --> 00:15:38.000
Because there was a wonderful actress I was working with on something called

230
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.630
Bryce, had revisited. And the producers said to her, will you,

231
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:45.050
will you lose some weight? She was absolutely exquisite.

232
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.210
And I said to them, if you speak to her about this again,

233
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:54.920
on any level, I will leave this picture. You are never to do that.

234
00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.630
It's evil, what's happening. What's going on out there. And it's getting worse.

235
00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:02.810
You know, the French fashion industry said, yeah, yeah, yeah, we will,

236
00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.500
we will get rid of size zero. And then, you know, it,

237
00:16:06.501 --> 00:16:11.060
didn't not only didn't, but just continued to, Oh, God is so boring.

238
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.820
Oh yeah. Oh.

239
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:17.390
So sometimes there are some subjects you just have to make noises about because

240
00:16:17.391 --> 00:16:20.420
it's so tedious and it's gone on and on. And when I was young,

241
00:16:20.421 --> 00:16:24.740
I was writing comedy absolutely about this. I wrote a sketch about, um,

242
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:28.880
the best diet that you can do, which is auto cannibalism, where you eat,

243
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:31.760
do we then an optimum body weight.

244
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:36.320
So in the sketch you have I've come on and I've got what was a bit of my butter

245
00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.600
on a plate. You know, that I've cooked,

246
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.910
but unfortunate I'm a little bit over on balance.

247
00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:45.410
I'll have to hold the weight in this hand, in order to stack the fries.

248
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.860
I was writing about this when I was 21 and it's still terrible.

249
00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:50.650
<v 3>But someone told me once that, uh,</v>

250
00:16:50.651 --> 00:16:55.030
the reason for David Beckham's immense popularity around the globe was that is a

251
00:16:55.031 --> 00:16:56.770
good footballer. And it's really handsome,

252
00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.400
but it didn't have any opinions because once you have opinions,

253
00:17:00.401 --> 00:17:03.910
you divide opinion. And how has that been for you?

254
00:17:03.911 --> 00:17:07.420
Because you've been really outspoken. Has it been easy for you to just do.

255
00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:12.550
<v 1>Not very popular? Absolutely. I mean, quite recently,</v>

256
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:15.340
um, I was a press conference in Germany when,

257
00:17:15.341 --> 00:17:18.310
just before the referendum about Brexit, a journalist said,

258
00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:23.110
should we leave the European union? And I said, Oh, don't be ridiculous.

259
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.210
Of course we shouldn't leave the European union.

260
00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:29.350
We're a little rainy cloud covered

261
00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:34.870
teeny cake, eating pilot, and we need your good heavens.

262
00:17:34.871 --> 00:17:38.050
It's absolutely wonderful that we can just put off and go to Europe.

263
00:17:38.051 --> 00:17:42.270
It's there's sunshine and French cheese, you know, and,

264
00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:45.460
and all of that, I mean, so I was doing a gag, you know,

265
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.100
and I got home and the front page of one of the tabloids was shot your K.

266
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.473
<v 0>Cole.</v>

267
00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.080
<v 1>Big, big group, you know, because the,</v>

268
00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:59.210
the sort of very right wing press were going, what do you mean?

269
00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:02.870
How can you describe our country? And this is in this negative light, actually,

270
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:08.060
I would say that what I said about England being rainy and cloud bolted

271
00:18:08.061 --> 00:18:11.360
and cake eating is absolutely true.

272
00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:15.470
But I would add two words in February because actually it's true.

273
00:18:15.471 --> 00:18:18.440
It's really true in February. Always say what you mean,

274
00:18:18.441 --> 00:18:21.050
and then you won't have to, you won't have to be thinking,

275
00:18:21.051 --> 00:18:24.650
which lie did I tell about that? You know, which lie did I say?

276
00:18:24.651 --> 00:18:28.760
Which thing that wasn't really what I thought did I say in order to keep on the

277
00:18:28.761 --> 00:18:33.260
right side of this group of people, that's, um, you know,

278
00:18:33.261 --> 00:18:35.000
that's for politicians to play at,

279
00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:39.560
but not if you're going to stand up for the things that you believe in.

280
00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:42.140
<v 0>Emma. Uh, if, um,</v>

281
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:51.530
let's say that you got another chance of the Donald Trump called you up today

282
00:18:51.531 --> 00:18:55.490
and invited you for dinner, would you, would you say is so tempting?

283
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:57.283
It is, isn't it.

284
00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.190
<v 1>So tempting just to just go suddenly, just to sort of say, look,</v>

285
00:19:01.191 --> 00:19:02.024
it's so nice of you to.

286
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:10.850
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>
