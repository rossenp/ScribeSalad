1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.290
<v 0>Did you, did you ever yourself drink that?</v>

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.670
I know that much, obviously, but does much more than you should. I mean.

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.503
<v 1>More than one.</v>

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.080
<v 2>And I was, uh, I was, uh,</v>

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.370
not far off being an alcoholic at one point I was drinking far too heavily.

6
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.410
What kind of [inaudible] for down my throat? I mean, I was,

7
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.150
and I was, uh,

8
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.110
I had this discipline where I wouldn't drink after thirsty in the week.

9
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.860
So didn't do a show on Saturday. So I had three days where I'd,

10
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.790
I suppose I kept me sane, but, uh, I went,

11
00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:38.090
I sought psychiatric help and, uh, I had that and uh,

12
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.200
I went to a doctor and all of that, and then he just put me straight. He said,

13
00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:43.490
listen, in the end, it's up to you.

14
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.470
If they do want to keep on drinking and maybe die from brain can lose your

15
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.910
career. And I thought that's a no brainer, but I knew be drunk.

16
00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:56.000
Still think of it that way. You see the thing of the good times the having,

17
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.090
how did Mary handle it very well? I mean,

18
00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:02.540
she was big pitiless or she's someone said to me, I mean,

19
00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:05.510
she was the real reason why I changed. She said to me,

20
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.430
do you know what your problem is when you're drunk? And I said, no, she said,

21
00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:14.030
you're ugly. Try that.

22
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.010
<v 0>Oh, you're welcome. Thank you.</v>

23
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.320
This is kind of surreal for me. Uh, as I have stolen so much from you,

24
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.180
um, even the chairs, I know this, that I told them.

25
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.770
I found my old chairs from the series I did here. Um,

26
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.320
I obviously, you, you were, you were always well-prepared. I mean,

27
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:43.250
you're famous for that, but, but, but did you also have a need for control?

28
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.830
<v 2>No, I don't think you can not see it.</v>

29
00:01:45.831 --> 00:01:50.300
You can't go in there thinking it's a wrestling match. It's that sphere.

30
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.460
It's a dialogue between two people.

31
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.610
And there comes a moment in time when you you've snared them,

32
00:01:55.611 --> 00:01:58.910
maybe where you are getting closer and closer to that relationship.

33
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.620
Sometimes it doesn't work,

34
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.920
but it's the most fascinating job in all of television.

35
00:02:03.921 --> 00:02:06.350
I think the other thing that Intuit is really,

36
00:02:06.351 --> 00:02:09.620
really fascinating is to down and analyze what it is that happens.

37
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.700
The difference between men and women. I mean, men are not collegiate at all.

38
00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:17.540
Men will come on like iron here, first guests, and then move there.

39
00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:21.650
The man comes on and he sits like that. You've seen that women don't do that.

40
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:23.600
They turn right. They talk to their collegiate.

41
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.870
And that's what a wonderful thing to do in groups of people because they gossip

42
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.630
naturally amongst the men don't want to do that. They're competitive,

43
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.660
all those little things that, you know, go to make up. They,

44
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.100
the fascination of this job.

45
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.600
<v 0>Did you, did you always have those three questions ahead?</v>

46
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.030
<v 2>No, I just said the one. I mean, I,</v>

47
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.730
I have a very good memory and I go down a, an Avenue and are going,

48
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.730
then I go to a crossroads there and I go right to our left,

49
00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:54.470
depending on what's happened. You, you have to plot it in a very loose way,

50
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.560
but you have to plot it and you have to do the research,

51
00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.740
even though that otherwise you're, you're Patty.

52
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.800
You're going to see that life though. Terribly.

53
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.870
<v 0>I mean, you're, you're sitting here now with, with an actress and a comedian.</v>

54
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.880
Yes. Uh.

55
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.700
<v 2>Get ready North country comedian ever met them.</v>

56
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.920
[inaudible] big laugh. I love comedians. Are these the most physical job.

57
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.990
<v 0>Do you think though, as, as, uh, as guests, were they easier than the actress?</v>

58
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.770
<v 2>They, they, they weren't, it's a typical job. It's a tough job. And also too,</v>

59
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.813
if they're coming on,

60
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.880
they're not doing their routine and they're trying to answer your could have

61
00:03:32.881 --> 00:03:35.760
aggression. It's difficult for them to be funny, as funny,

62
00:03:35.761 --> 00:03:36.750
as good as the routine,

63
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.800
but that if you get one going that they're just worthwhile. I mean,

64
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.360
Billy Connolly was my favorite comedian, uh, Robin Williams, people like that,

65
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.130
that wonderful a woman. What was the name? Oh, the Jewish lady.

66
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.920
Oh yeah. Uh, uh,

67
00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.000
Jewish woman. She does her own talk show.

68
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.770
She was a janitor. Joan Rivers, Joan Rivers, for instance. I mean,

69
00:04:04.771 --> 00:04:06.870
she was wonderful, extraordinary.

70
00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:09.990
She really was loved her dangerous and all that sort of thing.

71
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.920
And extremely funny in your show. I mean, the thing that that's,

72
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.870
that's the most difficult thing in the world and you'll know this better than

73
00:04:15.871 --> 00:04:19.120
anybody else is to make somebody laugh. It really is.

74
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.470
And it's the most difficult thing is to do it cold as well in a kind of

75
00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:26.580
situation like this. But when it happens, when it works, it's magical,

76
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.730
makes all those frustrating days worthwhile.

77
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.190
<v 0>Do, do you think, do you think Michael,</v>

78
00:04:32.191 --> 00:04:36.600
that there is a difference between celebrity today and celebrity back.

79
00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.220
<v 2>Then? I mean, when I started so residue of Hollywood, you know,</v>

80
00:04:41.221 --> 00:04:44.340
so I started interviewing in 1950,

81
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.190
Danny 63 interviewing on television. That is,

82
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.760
I'd done a lot before that immediate, but the difference was it,

83
00:04:50.761 --> 00:04:53.730
when I said ladies and gentlemen, my next guest is feather stair.

84
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.350
They never seen predecessor alive. They don't only see 30 foot high on a screen.

85
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.590
They didn't have Facebook to find out all about predecessor,

86
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.020
to know all about the mountain or the woman when they walked on.

87
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.490
And that's a big difference.

88
00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:08.400
I feel sorry for him to do this today because there's no mystery.

89
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.990
There's nothing to unravel.

90
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.640
I had a story which I could pick out and tell and hold them in fascination,

91
00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:18.270
hopefully, but today they know it. They know the story. Entertain me.

92
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.730
Tell me another joke. I've heard that one where you go, you know,

93
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.810
very difficult. Indeed. I had the best of it without a single shadow of a doubt.

94
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.110
And I'm rather than glad I'm not doing it today because it's been much more

95
00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:32.730
difficult. I had a cakewalk. I walk everywhere.

96
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.040
<v 0>Did, did you, did you find it difficult to find the right, the right timing for,</v>

97
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.570
for, for ending it? Oh, I do.

98
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.430
<v 2>I mean of them space.</v>

99
00:05:41.431 --> 00:05:44.550
You've got to ask the question to which there's an interesting answer and all

100
00:05:44.551 --> 00:05:45.390
that stuff, you know,

101
00:05:45.391 --> 00:05:50.160
but it was better when you talk to people who hadn't expressed their life

102
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.880
open fully to people. And also when they had a career, I mean,

103
00:05:53.881 --> 00:05:56.490
some of these people actually, like feather said, they made a hundred movies.

104
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.200
I mean, there weren't just like one or two overnight success.

105
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:03.230
These are great stars. When I said ladies and gentlemen,

106
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.860
my next guest is James Cagney. There was a gasp in the audience, you know?

107
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.640
I mean, James Cagney, would we ever see him like this? No, not at all.

108
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.640
They never had. So it was wonderful. It was like, you know,

109
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:17.540
going around a wonderful museum for the very first time and pointing up people

110
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:18.470
in glass cases.

111
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.610
<v 0>Where are you aware of that at the time?</v>

112
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.030
<v 2>No. Well, yeah. Well, I was aware of the fact that I was,</v>

113
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.110
I was privileged because what happened when I first started in the television

114
00:06:29.111 --> 00:06:32.500
business, it coincided with Hollywood align the stars,

115
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.910
freedom up until that point. They're not allowed, this is early sixties, 63.

116
00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.400
They're not allowed people to go on television.

117
00:06:39.401 --> 00:06:42.370
I thought because the television was a devil, spawn,

118
00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.800
television would ruin everything, all that sort of thing.

119
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.100
Eventually they got the message and then allowed them on. And of course,

120
00:06:48.101 --> 00:06:51.940
so therefore I was there right in the very beginning when it all came flooding

121
00:06:51.941 --> 00:06:54.490
down the stairs and it was marvelous. I.

122
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.920
<v 0>I know that you had a special soft spot for a Swedish actress, uh,</v>

123
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.010
ethylene. Well, uh, there's another one.

124
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:10.120
[inaudible].

125
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.240
<v 2>Oh, Ingrid, Bergman. I first love. Yeah, absolutely.</v>

126
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.640
Of course. Anybody who was sobering because the blanket fell for her. I mean,

127
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.930
her director took two days to lighter and they said, why you're taking so long.

128
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.880
And if it goes, when they see or the audience,

129
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.700
every mother has to fall in love with it, we all did.

130
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.530
<v 0>And how old were you then?</v>

131
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.840
<v 2>I suppose that'd be about 12.</v>

132
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:35.420
I don't taste.

133
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.493
<v 0>One thing.</v>

134
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.750
What's the biggest sense of trust between a celebrity or the journalists

135
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.950
back then? Because now,

136
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.760
nowadays you can't really control where the information goes.

137
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.020
It's a very interesting, important.

138
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.500
<v 2>They too were the reaction that you get on Instagram and stuff like that.</v>

139
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.770
You know, the, the, these awful trolls come in and say terrible things,

140
00:07:56.771 --> 00:07:59.890
or he looked awful and I saw them. They didn't have that at all. So yes,

141
00:07:59.891 --> 00:08:03.220
there will be supremely competent. I think from that point of view, again,

142
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.920
you raise a very interesting point. I mean, fancy doing an interview.

143
00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.560
They've been frightened of what they're going to say about you on the internet.

144
00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:13.360
I think that that it's an impossible task. Really. Have you done that? Did it,

145
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.920
that I could, I would hate to do it now.

146
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:21.070
<v 0>Have you, as a person ever been shy, shy, I'm quite shy.</v>

147
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:25.840
<v 2>I've been here shy all my life, but I took me a long time to get married. I was,</v>

148
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.780
no, I'm not, I'm not, uh, I'm not an extrovert in that sense at all.

149
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.150
Although when I'm, when I'm working, then,

150
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.310
then you'll have to have a confidence in what you do.

151
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.340
And that's a different thing. Then you're not allowed to be shy.

152
00:08:39.341 --> 00:08:42.340
You have to be somebody else in a sense. It's an act. We all know.

153
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.630
<v 0>So how, how did you meet? I mean, you're, you've been married for like 60 years.</v>

154
00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.640
<v 2>60 Years this year.</v>

155
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:49.923
<v 0>This is amazing.</v>

156
00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.210
[inaudible] we have a lot of divorces in Sweden and Norway,

157
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:04.530
so that's why they're so, so how did you,

158
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.650
how did you manage to get hurt? Well, I've never in all my life.

159
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.620
<v 2>Further away than 10 miles from there. My wife, because we were bought up in,</v>

160
00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.910
uh, in the mining area in Yorkshire,

161
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.230
Amelia was father worked in one Caulfield and my dad worked in the other code.

162
00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:22.160
So without knowing that we met eventually when I was a journalist and a local

163
00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:24.230
paper, uh, she was a school teacher.

164
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.010
She was going off to a meeting on a bus and I sat next to her.

165
00:09:28.011 --> 00:09:28.844
I fell in love with her.

166
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.520
<v 0>No, no. I got a friend to tell her, you got a friend.</v>

167
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.830
<v 2>The date. And, uh, and then from that point on.</v>

168
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:45.470
<v 0>Any questions for her.</v>

169
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.620
<v 2>No predator scenario, but I wanted to actually,</v>

170
00:09:51.621 --> 00:09:55.610
she had a boyfriend at the time and I wanted to go to the,

171
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.990
to the hotel where we danced in this Saturday evenings. And I wanted to,

172
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:04.010
to play on the, the band to play a certain song.

173
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.920
And at that precise moment in time, as it played out,

174
00:10:06.921 --> 00:10:10.040
I wanted to interrupt him and said, uh, pardon me?

175
00:10:10.041 --> 00:10:13.760
But I'd like to dance with your father. And he was said to me, she's buying.

176
00:10:13.761 --> 00:10:15.650
I said, no, she's buying. I'm going to marry you.

177
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:18.920
<v 0>I didn't do that.</v>

178
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.490
[inaudible] no, no, no, no. I don't. I, you.

179
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.590
<v 2>Through the friend and I, we, we had a romance and a nice romance and I,</v>

180
00:10:30.591 --> 00:10:33.080
I proposed to it and the sea front it's calm.

181
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.690
<v 0>And, uh, and we've been married.</v>

182
00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:40.520
<v 2>We've got three children and we've got five grandchildren and everything's fine.</v>

183
00:10:40.521 --> 00:10:43.010
I mean, we're very happy. Uh, Mary looks wonderful.

184
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:45.740
She still is as attractive as ever.

185
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.220
And of course she had an extraordinary career. She was a teacher.

186
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:54.610
And then when I was doing an afternoon show on ITV, uh, uh, uh,

187
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.890
show him brilliant women very early on, uh,

188
00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.650
she was asked by the problem of control that he asked me,

189
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.490
would I mind if he screen tested her? Gosh, she looks fantastic.

190
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.390
And she did the screen test and she was she a very bright lady and she became a

191
00:11:08.391 --> 00:11:11.420
very good into it. And this is one of my favorite stories of all.

192
00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:15.380
I was sitting next to a high powered Tory politician at the time.

193
00:11:15.381 --> 00:11:18.440
And this is such a, there's an eventful about school milk.

194
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.850
She actually bounced called milk.

195
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.880
So my wife being an ex-teacher was up in arms about this.

196
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:27.530
So they sent the junior minister down to talk to Mary about this situation,

197
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.260
started the show. I started the show, LinkedIn to her,

198
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:34.550
and the next thing that he was a tutorial, Grandy, a real tutorial or whichever.

199
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.450
And he was looking at this young minister who was trying to deal with Marianne

200
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:42.800
mate, tore him apart. Absolutely brilliantly destroyed him.

201
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.640
And it ended up in an argument in any case. But in the end,

202
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.250
when she finished and handed back to me to go into a break,

203
00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.780
he was on the floor and ashes,

204
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.470
and I could feel his Tory Grundy to be tiny like this,

205
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:56.560
just this demolition job went on.

206
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.310
I remember I got linked into the commercial brick. He turned to Bishop.

207
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.550
Good God, if I didn't see that, I said, I did. He said,

208
00:12:03.551 --> 00:12:04.990
I'd hate to be married to her.

209
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:19.360
<v 0>[Inaudible] if you think, if I asked her if she's known you for 60 years,</v>

210
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.800
since before you became Parkinson's, um,

211
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:26.730
do you think she would say that television changed you?

212
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.140
<v 2>Yes, I think so. I think she might say that. And I think it does. I mean,</v>

213
00:12:31.141 --> 00:12:32.370
you have to, as I said,

214
00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:36.510
I'm not a really extrovert person at all.

215
00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.070
I'm quite shy in many ways.

216
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:43.320
And it took a real sense of will to get on there and believe

217
00:12:43.321 --> 00:12:45.570
that you have to do this because now you're in the spotlight.

218
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.580
And so we're gonna do it. Don't go being coy about it.

219
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.480
You're going to do it face up. I think everybody does that.

220
00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:55.380
I think I've never known an actress who wasn't that way,

221
00:12:55.381 --> 00:12:59.400
you know? I mean, I think you have to be to, to actually do the job properly.

222
00:12:59.401 --> 00:13:02.190
I mean, walk around and see, I am the greatest actress in the most bet.

223
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:06.810
David should know, Oh, you're not. Are you fundable human being basically,

224
00:13:06.811 --> 00:13:10.440
that's what you are doing a particular job to the best of your ability

225
00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.850
to know about your vulnerability. I never met a great former who was arrogant.

226
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.370
I didn't know. Cause you can't.

227
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.940
Cause you do know that no matter how good you are one day, one day,

228
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:32.100
it'll all go. You'll fall on your face. But.

229
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:38.430
<v 0>Your wife, has she, has she been involved in your questions? Oh,</v>

230
00:13:38.431 --> 00:13:40.680
you should ask her this. You should ask him about,

231
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:43.200
or she doesn't speak like that. By the way

232
00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:53.640
[inaudible] wife, is she a Royal or.

233
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.490
<v 2>I think she wrote it, but she's not really no coal miner's daughter.</v>

234
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:04.320
<v 0>Has she been doing inputs in your questionnaires or no.</v>

235
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.040
<v 2>No, no, absolutely not. No. She leaves me alone. I left her alone too.</v>

236
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.530
Absolutely. I mean, you can't do other people's interviews for.

237
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:16.590
<v 0>Well, one, one person that that was changed, uh,</v>

238
00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:18.240
by a success in a way,

239
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:23.190
was George Best the footballer whom you have whom you written your second

240
00:14:23.191 --> 00:14:24.024
book now?

241
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:25.800
<v 2>Well, that's, uh, I, I wrote many books,</v>

242
00:14:25.801 --> 00:14:28.340
but I've written two books in a series about people,

243
00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:33.410
particularly new or Mohammed Ali and George Best and best as

244
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:34.560
their most lovers.

245
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.650
<v 0>But, but this is, it's a second book about George Best as well.</v>

246
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.633
You wrote about him.

247
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:41.880
<v 2>First of all, then I wrote about George Best,</v>

248
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:44.880
but I've written many books are Mark because I'm a journalist. Basically.

249
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.550
I've been a journalist all my life from writing. I did.

250
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.410
I've been a journalist now for, well,

251
00:14:49.411 --> 00:14:54.110
I started when I was 16 seven when I started until it was just an addition.

252
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.720
It was a, it was a toy. Um, no, so, uh, I D Mo George,

253
00:14:59.721 --> 00:15:00.554
I knew I was in,

254
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:05.810
I'd started at Granada television in Manchester in 1963 and I was

255
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.760
doing a daily show and I was producing the show and a guy Ron got Patsy and Dan

256
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:15.920
said to me one day said, uh, uh, we got a new group coming up, uh, from London,

257
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.940
you should interview the lead singer. He said, because he's a bright lad.

258
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.520
And I thought, and he said, get one of the old reporters to do it.

259
00:15:22.521 --> 00:15:25.880
And I thought, no, no report. I want to be famous. Don't mind, I'll do it.

260
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.650
And I did it in my first interview. It was a Jagger that was in 1963.

261
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.080
And from that point on, I liked it so much,

262
00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:35.870
but I actually continued doing it and not producing anymore.

263
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.300
So that was the start of it. So.

264
00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:43.080
<v 0>So tell me, tell me about George Best because he, he, he,</v>

265
00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:47.770
he was really, I mean, you, you written a book about Jack, but she's his, um,

266
00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.070
uh, he was really changed by success.

267
00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.030
<v 2>Well,</v>

268
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:56.350
George is 17 years of age when he came to Manchester and the grunting

269
00:15:56.650 --> 00:16:00.340
wonderful team of they have them. Matt Busby was the Niger mum.

270
00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:03.310
Must've been looking since the aircraft was killed. All his players.

271
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.010
He was looking for one man who actually,

272
00:16:06.011 --> 00:16:08.500
he thought tick him into Europe to win the European cup.

273
00:16:08.501 --> 00:16:12.310
And he found him in this 17 year old wave from Northern Ireland.

274
00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.160
It was about the shape of a cocktail stick.

275
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.760
When I met him and the weight about four stone, I, a bit of an exaggeration,

276
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:23.530
but he was a child. But by God, he was a tough child. More than that,

277
00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.550
he was a beautiful child. I've never seen him more Hanson player in my life.

278
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:32.200
The George was in every sense, physically, emotionally the love, you know,

279
00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.390
and for the first time in Manchester,

280
00:16:34.391 --> 00:16:37.390
I remember going there after George had been playing for about a year,

281
00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:39.370
you thought what's different. What was different?

282
00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:43.990
Was that the noise of the crowd, there was a soprano section, you know,

283
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.460
baritones and basses and tenors. And then all of a sudden, you know,

284
00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:50.290
this over the top.

285
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:53.110
And none of those are the girls that he attracted to the game.

286
00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.320
And from that point on, I knew football had changed. He changed it.

287
00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:01.000
And he was as much about being that, that kind of representation of sex symbol.

288
00:17:01.001 --> 00:17:01.834
If you like,

289
00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.440
as it wasn't about any gift to the hand of football as a footballer,

290
00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.560
he had all the gifts. He was a wonderful.

291
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.540
<v 0>But, but could, could he, could he handle that stardom.</v>

292
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.600
<v 2>Who could, is a 17 year old boy from, from,</v>

293
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.720
from the back door of Northern Ireland.

294
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.700
He had no training at all in this,

295
00:17:18.701 --> 00:17:22.630
he was a kid who went to a local school and he just had us a blind gift.

296
00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.930
And he just had the most beautiful face. And of course, you know,

297
00:17:25.931 --> 00:17:29.740
both in the end conspired to actually bring him down, but I'll tell you what,

298
00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:30.850
you had a wonderful time.

299
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.900
I never knew a football or a better time with George.

300
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.860
<v 0>You must remember it. Yeah, for sure. Um, man, um,</v>

301
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:43.810
I grew up in the seventies, late seventies, George Patton was a legend.

302
00:17:43.811 --> 00:17:47.740
He was like, the first of course Pele was like a superstar,

303
00:17:47.741 --> 00:17:50.190
but George Pez was sort of the modern.

304
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.910
<v 2>Pop star football player want to get into the argument who is better than</v>

305
00:17:53.911 --> 00:17:57.870
Maradona, Pele, George, best as a celiac. And they're all great players.

306
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.720
What George had, what those didn't have the sex appeal.

307
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.950
And that was part of his problem. Parts of the visit bill. I mean,

308
00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:09.840
he had a huge female following and I've never seen anybody attract women

309
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:14.910
like, like George [inaudible] all kinds of shapes and sizes. It was amazing.

310
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.470
And he was besotted by them too.

311
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:20.600
<v 0>And he, he became a heavy drinker. Yeah.</v>

312
00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.940
<v 2>We all drank. We all drank of that in those days. I mean, uh, I remember, uh,</v>

313
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.970
football or walking through the plate glass doors of Granada,

314
00:18:28.971 --> 00:18:31.340
television leave and impression there.

315
00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.140
But that was the only time times I got out of, I said,

316
00:18:33.141 --> 00:18:36.350
be careful with the drink. I mean, before that, it didn't matter.

317
00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:40.340
I see people drunk out their heads on television that it used to happen in those

318
00:18:40.341 --> 00:18:43.520
days. It was a bit like the wild West, you know, uh,

319
00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.310
on George's part of that culture, football is ranked food.

320
00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:47.350
We all drank and it was.

321
00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:50.630
<v 0>Did you have the drunken guests on as well?</v>

322
00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:54.290
<v 2>Oh, I had one or two drugs. I never drank myself. Um, this is true.</v>

323
00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.830
Cause I dead, you know, it's like you go on television, get the lights on,

324
00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:01.610
you know that. So all that pancakes off and you're gone, you're frazzled.

325
00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:04.490
So I never did that. There are a lot of people did.

326
00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:08.210
And a lot of footballers did too. And, and George of course got the money.

327
00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.840
He had the, the fame, he had all the adulation and.

328
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.910
<v 0>I knew it was, it was, it made him.</v>

329
00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.940
<v 2>Giddy. And in that sense, and he was a tragic figure. In the end,</v>

330
00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:22.160
it became a sad drunk as people do. He became Flawn.

331
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:25.580
He became defenseless. Uh,

332
00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:29.390
and you'll see him in a pub and you'd walk away because you didn't want to face

333
00:19:29.391 --> 00:19:34.130
the fact that your mate or your love was actually looking less than

334
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:36.890
pretty did did.

335
00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:41.060
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, he was your, your not only a favorite guest of yours,</v>

336
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:42.380
but he was a friend also.

337
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:44.420
<v 2>It was, it was a great friend.</v>

338
00:19:44.421 --> 00:19:48.410
He used to come down to our house and he used to always Chuck a bag of balls

339
00:19:48.411 --> 00:19:50.780
into the room for my three sons to play with them.

340
00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.340
And they'd play football all day long.

341
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.880
And I'd sometimes get some of my friends similar,

342
00:19:55.881 --> 00:19:59.210
more famous to come down and see him because they like to bring their kids down

343
00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.090
and he would ignore them. Totally. But he'd play with their kids.

344
00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:05.060
He play football with them. And Michael, my son was here today.

345
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:07.880
It was a wonderful story. He was about six or seven.

346
00:20:07.881 --> 00:20:12.230
And the next on the set is Sunday. George played football within our guard.

347
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:15.850
And then the next day he went to school on his own to a Catholic school and

348
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.470
none. And she said to the children, what did you do this weekend?

349
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:22.430
They'll say we went for grinding. The part of the data and resigned. He said,

350
00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.940
yes, Michael, what did you do? So I played football with George Best. She said,

351
00:20:25.941 --> 00:20:28.790
don't tell terrible lies back. What's an awful thing to do.

352
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.270
I actually made her sat in a corner. So this was be great.

353
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.510
She'll send it to the next time that George Best came down. Mike said to George,

354
00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:39.170
George had got detention because of you told him the story. George said,

355
00:20:39.171 --> 00:20:42.770
get me that football. It's going to football, white football to sister song.

356
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:47.210
So this is to tell you that Michael did not tell a lie. He did play football.

357
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:50.390
Me love George. Best. I took it to

358
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:57.090
[inaudible].

359
00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:01.380
<v 0>Oh, did you have, did you experience that,</v>

360
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.640
that moment when with George, uh, you, when you,

361
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:09.300
when you tried to avoid him that you didn't want to be with him.

362
00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:14.520
<v 2>The ultimate betrayal, isn't it, that's the ultimate thing you Scott.</v>

363
00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:15.780
And she was that sort of thing. But yes,

364
00:21:15.781 --> 00:21:20.190
there were times when I didn't want to be with him the times I wanted to do,

365
00:21:20.191 --> 00:21:24.750
I suppose this associate myself from him, but they started that with all drugs.

366
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.660
Isn't it, you know, they're highly amusing themselves,

367
00:21:27.661 --> 00:21:30.390
but not to you after a while, particularly if you're not drunk with them,

368
00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.140
that's the problem. But not too often. I mean, I think our men,

369
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:38.700
and then I couldn't go to the hospital to watch him because I've been told I may

370
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:42.720
turn yellow and all that. And he was dying and I didn't want to see that.

371
00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:47.110
I mean, you know, we'll do ward, you know, and I was away in Australia when,

372
00:21:47.111 --> 00:21:49.620
when he died. And, uh, and uh,

373
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:54.060
I still feel bad about being away when he did die. But, uh,

374
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.590
but nonetheless, I mean, uh, we more than made up for it when we were together,

375
00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:03.330
when he was not drunk, you know, and when he was in his prime and, uh,

376
00:22:03.331 --> 00:22:04.780
and I treasure moments of his,

377
00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:08.160
the social never forget as a player I'm as the man.

378
00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:14.100
<v 0>Did you, did you ever yourself drink that?</v>

379
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.970
Not that much, obviously, but as much more than you should.

380
00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.870
<v 2>No, I did. I mean, I, I, when I was, I was, uh,</v>

381
00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:26.160
not far off being an alcoholic at one point I was drinking far too heavily.

382
00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:31.200
What kind of [inaudible] fall down my throat. I mean, I was,

383
00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.940
and I was, uh,

384
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:36.900
I had this discipline where I wouldn't drink after Thursday in a week,

385
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:38.430
so didn't do a show on Saturday.

386
00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:44.160
So I had three days where I suppose that kept me sane. But, uh,

387
00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.910
I went, I sought psychiatric help and, uh, I had that and, uh,

388
00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:51.660
I went to a doctor and, and all of that. And then he just put me straight.

389
00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:52.710
He said, listen, at the end,

390
00:22:52.711 --> 00:22:57.600
it's up to you is they do want to keep on drinking and maybe die from brain

391
00:22:57.601 --> 00:23:01.320
can lose your career. And I thought that's a no-brainer,

392
00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.750
but I knew drunk. Still think of it that way.

393
00:23:03.751 --> 00:23:05.820
You see the thing of the good times that having,

394
00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:10.380
how did Mary handle it very well? I mean, she was big pitiless.

395
00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.640
She, someone said to me, I mean, she was the real reason why I changed.

396
00:23:14.641 --> 00:23:19.320
She said to me, do you know what your problem is when you're drunk?

397
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:23.820
And I said, no, she said, you're ugly driver.

398
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.810
[inaudible] slightly vain. But they tried every other possible.

399
00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.540
Every other word, you know, the ugly. It was the, I thought, no, I'll tell you

400
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:39.780
I'm not. And, uh, so I stopped. It wasn't as easy as that.

401
00:23:39.781 --> 00:23:43.380
It never is, but, but you have to, if you've got any, any sense.

402
00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:47.780
<v 0>But do you think that it was the pressure from stardom that made you drink or</v>

403
00:23:47.781 --> 00:23:48.310
was it.

404
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:51.430
<v 2>No, that's the easy way out. That's bold, frankly. I mean,</v>

405
00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:55.780
I'm sort of that's that's bull. Um, I, um, no, I didn't. I mean,

406
00:23:55.781 --> 00:23:59.350
that's a convenient excuse and, uh, there's no good doing that. I mean,

407
00:23:59.351 --> 00:24:02.740
if you start making convenient, convenient excuses like that,

408
00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:07.120
you'd never going to stop. So why do you think you'd rank why I was unhappy?

409
00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:11.530
I was unhappy or I was happy. I don't know which, I mean, I,

410
00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.620
I was in a convivial situation. I mean, I came out to fleet street.

411
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:18.940
The police treated that's the street of dreams used to be for all the

412
00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:21.790
newspapers. Exactly. And when I was down there,

413
00:24:21.791 --> 00:24:25.750
it was a bit like Dodge city without the sheriff. I mean,

414
00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:27.900
he was full of saloons,

415
00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:31.060
attempting maidens and drink and all that so that you couldn't help,

416
00:24:31.061 --> 00:24:35.770
but go there. So by the time I got into television, I had had a up, you know,

417
00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:40.090
I was, uh, I was a seasoned drinker, so I had to learn to be a,

418
00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.970
not to be that that was the difference, but there's,

419
00:24:42.971 --> 00:24:45.850
that's where I'd served my apprenticeship and fleet street.

420
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:49.330
<v 0>It's a, it's not a healthy life journalist misery.</v>

421
00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:55.390
<v 2>No, not really. I mean, it it's, uh, I can't think of any other life,</v>

422
00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:59.430
actually. I know I've done all my life since I was 16. So I.

423
00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:04.240
<v 0>Actually there, when, how Marshall's plane went down one year,</v>

424
00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.210
when in Congo, you went to Congo to meet hamartia.

425
00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.320
<v 2>I knew that I needed to be with the biggest mistakes of my life.</v>

426
00:25:11.321 --> 00:25:15.250
I was standing on a brilliant defense with an old Germans called silver veins

427
00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.760
live from a dead express. He was coming out, leaving the Congo I was going in.

428
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:20.110
And, uh,

429
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:23.830
we saw this plane Cobain and we saw two or three people get up over about half a

430
00:25:23.831 --> 00:25:28.570
mile away and all the press, he arrived at that sort of thing.

431
00:25:28.571 --> 00:25:32.620
And I said to Sue I a while I said, you're not going to write anything. He said,

432
00:25:32.621 --> 00:25:37.210
what I'm going to write. I saw that Michelle's arrival. Did you see dark?

433
00:25:37.211 --> 00:25:37.690
How much shall.

434
00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:39.970
<v 0>We say? I shouldn't? Yes. I said.</v>

435
00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:43.390
<v 2>You didn't think you saw a man, the plane, could you identify Madame Michelle?</v>

436
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:46.370
I said, no. He said, that's why I've not failed.

437
00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.490
But of course he was the only one who didn't fall.

438
00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:52.960
And I'm sure that of course is dead. He crashed 10 miles away.

439
00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.330
Great lesson to a young girl.

440
00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:02.080
<v 0>Um, tell me, Michael, uh, who,</v>

441
00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:06.430
who was your Holy grail? Who was the one you never got on your show?

442
00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.100
Sinatra? [inaudible].

443
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:12.000
<v 2>Um, I think it's an officer is the greatest artist,</v>

444
00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:16.330
a greatest singer of any man and woman in the

445
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:20.720
20th back, the 20th century, uh, uh,

446
00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:23.860
wonderful, wonderful singer. I tried very hard.

447
00:26:23.861 --> 00:26:26.950
I got for friendly with a van who wrote songs from called Sammy con.

448
00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:29.430
And he took me to a party in, in, in,

449
00:26:29.431 --> 00:26:33.160
in LA and I met Sinatra and some artists

450
00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:38.200
[inaudible] Mike Parkinson. He does a great talk show and I'm buying it,

451
00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:42.850
Mike Frank and all that. So I went there and then I wonder around this,

452
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.810
the suddenly went off somewhere else. And I wonder, I didn't know anybody,

453
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.740
but me and Frank Sinatra. And so I thought about half an hour got go away.

454
00:26:49.741 --> 00:26:52.770
So I went up the synopsis that I'm living now,

455
00:26:52.771 --> 00:26:56.370
it started nice to met you and hopefully I'll see you in London. He said,

456
00:26:56.371 --> 00:27:00.510
sure thing, David, he said, I really made a Mark here.

457
00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:08.270
<v 0>Well, um, then I have to say, uh, Michael, that,</v>

458
00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.540
uh, you are missing the ultra. Thank you so much for, uh,

459
