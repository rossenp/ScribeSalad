[inaudible]. So I'm there stay in. No,

254
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:12.330
I didn't do poorly community consumes and they meet,

255
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:18.270
uh, the bad communication pandemic that's happening now.

256
00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:22.470
It's just as high up a problem. And it's not just the United States.

257
00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.700
It's in Europe.

258
00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:28.590
You have people who feel free now to be openly

259
00:23:28.591 --> 00:23:32.490
racist and misogynist and intolerant.

260
00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.940
And you know, of course this example is set by,

261
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:40.140
by our leaders often, you know, and, uh,

262
00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:44.720
they give people permission to behave this way problem, uh,

263
00:23:44.721 --> 00:23:48.710
at eager communicator. So God also fully come and say for fall.

264
00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:52.370
And so I'm feeling, or some Linda ma my data scale USA,

265
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:58.850
your in for loss, uh, declared the cloud.

266
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.870
[inaudible] Lisa. So me film and logistics in the movie.

267
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:09.440
Yeah. Horrible at Mina, you know, memories, um,

268
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:12.523
um,

269
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:18.620
familiar ban as a connections, family connections,

270
00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:21.680
the memory of a time when we could connect

271
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:27.350
might help us to reconnect. Now,

272
00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.980
this is what happens in the story with the family. And I think in society,

273
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:34.700
whether it's the United States or Norway or Denmark or Ethiopia,

274
00:24:34.701 --> 00:24:37.730
or anywhere when people remember,

275
00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:45.320
um, you know, any country, Argentina, Somalia, anywhere, anywhere,

276
00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:50.060
it doesn't matter if people together make an

277
00:24:50.061 --> 00:24:54.110
effort to remember moments in their society's history,

278
00:24:54.111 --> 00:24:58.490
when there was a good communication and some give and take. Yeah.

279
00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:02.840
Then they can reestablish that again. I'm optimistic in that way.

280
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:08.480
Uh, yeah. Toward a more leads Alto. Uh, [inaudible] falling.

281
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:13.850
The handler must come in far on certain or certain,

282
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:19.370
uh, Myers. He's very stubborn. Uh,

283
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:22.160
and they'll communicate they're missing far.

284
00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.620
[inaudible] [inaudible] are they more lit?

285
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:34.640
It's possible that even if you are just as stubborn about communicating as the

286
00:25:34.641 --> 00:25:37.100
other person is stubborn about not communicating,

287
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.610
maybe you will never have a point of contact.

288
00:25:40.611 --> 00:25:44.480
Maybe you will not find compassion and empathy,

289
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:48.530
but it's possible. If you say, forget it,

290
00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:51.950
the relationship is over. I'm not talking to you anymore.

291
00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:55.790
Then there is no hope for progress. The same with different countries,

292
00:25:56.060 --> 00:26:00.770
different races, different religions. If you stop talking, then nothing happens.

293
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:04.040
They say got, so they hadn't been there for my

294
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:08.563

298
00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:30.430
[inaudible] uh, [inaudible] Peter Jackson's

299
00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:35.763
[inaudible] [inaudible].

300
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:39.070
<v 1>They are loud, uh,</v>

301
00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:42.963
analysts and they,

302
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:49.530
so did you have four torching eating, some add them the,

303
00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:55.170
uh, Delto you didn't feel clear loggy by the FIC

304
00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:01.500
FLIR Molitor for Finn Arba, uh, go all, uh, you know,

305
00:27:01.501 --> 00:27:04.500
good parts, good opportunities. I mean,

306
00:27:04.501 --> 00:27:07.260
the victory is to layout VAR at,

307
00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.460
you know, to solve problems. You know,

308
00:27:13.461 --> 00:27:17.240
it was a long shoot and Peter Jackson had a crew of maybe

309
00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:18.950
700 people.

310
00:27:18.951 --> 00:27:23.600
Most of them from New Zealand who had very little experience in making

311
00:27:23.601 --> 00:27:27.920
movies, many of them and no experience in making a huge movie like that one.

312
00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:31.280
So they learn [inaudible] or revise

313
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:37.730
[inaudible] and two they're not malaria and film or,

314
00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:42.170
and Peter Jackson was, was amazing in his patients.

315
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:45.710
And he always working collectively with people,

316
00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.440
found ways to solve all kinds of problems,

317
00:27:48.441 --> 00:27:53.060
even if he had to invent a completely new way of filming something. Well,

318
00:27:53.061 --> 00:27:54.620
it can be done. We'll figure out a way.

319
00:27:55.070 --> 00:28:00.020
So it was just that there's always a solution and you don't have to

320
00:28:00.021 --> 00:28:04.850
do it by yourself. In fact, it's always better if you do it as a team,

321
00:28:04.851 --> 00:28:09.470
you know? So did they allowed a mist on Firefox

322
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.690
Peter Jackson or then fin.
