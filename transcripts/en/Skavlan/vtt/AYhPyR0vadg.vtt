00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:03.523
<v 0>[Inaudible] guardians</v>

2
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.310
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] or Trump blue card.

3
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.300
And welcome Scandinavia.

4
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.930
<v 1>[Inaudible] you have your.</v>

5
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.210
<v 0>You've had your own problems with, with the Russian state?</v>

6
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:27.350
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

7
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.060
I was a reporter arriving in Moscow in Russia in 2007 with my

8
00:00:32.061 --> 00:00:34.760
wife and my two brothers, small cute kids.

9
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.910
And within about three or four months, uh,

10
00:00:37.911 --> 00:00:42.350
I was writing articles that just the manager saw on the video, Mr. Putin,

11
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.880
uh, um, we, we sort of found ourselves in a kind of rather bad spy,

12
00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:49.760
thriller novel, and I had, um,

13
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.300
guys wearing cheap leather jackets,

14
00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:55.940
sort of following me around the kind of icy streets of Moscow. Um,

15
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.450
and whenever I called London and for example,

16
00:00:59.451 --> 00:01:02.540
made a joke about the Russian president, I would get kind of

17
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.410
underline would be mysteriously cuts, uh, for if someone was listening in,

18
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.760
I think that was fairly routine,

19
00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:15.650
but what was kind of a bit dark and a bit funny and a bit terrible. It was,

20
00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:17.390
we had a series of break-ins

21
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.260
in the apartment where I was living with my wife and kids,

22
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.610
and I went to go and see the, the British embassy in Moscow. And I said like,

23
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.520
you know, what, what the hell is going on? And they said, well,

24
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.080
I'm afraid your apartment is now bugged. Yeah. Uh, and, um,

25
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.910
they wanted you to know, instead of, you know, showing off almost, and I said,

26
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:42.440
is there anything we can do about it? And they said, no. Um, and I said,

27
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.820
is the video? And they said, yes. Uh, and it turned out, we had,

28
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.270
we had kind of total surveillance in our apartment, which is fairly usual.

29
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.510
And one of the reasons we knew this is on one occasion,

30
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.700
we're on holiday in Berlin. Um,

31
00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.680
and we came back and the KGB stroke FSB had left us a little present

32
00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:04.250
by the side of the bed, which I shared with my wife. Um,

33
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.670
and it was a sex manual in Russian, um,

34
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.480
together with all the kind of middle-class novels in English that I read,

35
00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:15.200
someone had left a little presence, uh, and, um,

36
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.900
they bookmarked it, they put a bookmark in.

37
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.470
So I thought this is the strangest moment of my life.

38
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.130
And I turned over to page 127. Um,

39
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.700
and it was a page on orgasms. Uh, and I thought,

40
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.500
what message is the KGB trying to tell me and my wife, is it,

41
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.850
is there a technical issue perhaps, or, um, no,

42
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.040
the frequency or w w what is it, what was the tips?

43
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.423
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

44
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.780
<v 2>The secret? The thing is, you know,</v>

45
00:02:56.781 --> 00:02:59.890
w when I came to sort of write the story of Donald from Russia,

46
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.250
it is this famous incident with Trump in 2013,

47
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:07.960
when he came in for the miss universe, beauty pageant, lots of beautiful women,

48
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.770
um, and this famous dossier by this British spy,

49
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.690
Christopher Steele says that that maybe Trump didn't go to

50
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:19.500
bed early with it, Swedish crime novel, that,

51
00:03:19.501 --> 00:03:22.060
that maybe something else happened. Um, you know,

52
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.390
did Donald Trump behave badly and Moscow? We don't know.

53
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.810
Trump knows Putin knows Russian spiders. No,

54
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.380
but would their video everything he did? Of course they would.

55
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.750
Of course they would. So what they do.

56
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.180
<v 0>Um, before, before we talk about today,</v>

57
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.890
let's talk about 1987, uh, because this is, uh,

58
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.830
significant in your book. Uh, Trump goes to Moscow for the first time. Why,

59
00:03:48.831 --> 00:03:49.620
why is that?

60
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.240
<v 2>He's a kind of a young, famous property tycoon from New York,</v>

61
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.520
and he's invited by the Soviet government to go to communists Moscow.

62
00:03:59.521 --> 00:04:01.290
They pay all his expenses.

63
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.550
The Soviet ambassador goes to see him in Trump tower and says, you know, I have,

64
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.420
I have admired you, Mr. Trump, please come to Russia. Um,

65
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.800
and he, he goes there, um, to talk about building a hotel, which,

66
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.830
which never happens. And I think what's kind of interesting is, you know,

67
00:04:16.831 --> 00:04:21.060
I've spoken to former KGB people who say this was a kind of

68
00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:24.510
classic, it's called a kind of cultivation exercise.

69
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.400
You get to know someone, you give them a good time. And,

70
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.940
um,

71
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.620
what we also know from history is the KGB during this period was very keen to

72
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.390
kind of recruit more American contacts. Um, and so,

73
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.100
you know what precisely happened. We don't know,

74
00:04:41.101 --> 00:04:43.680
but it looks to me what my sources say was,

75
00:04:43.681 --> 00:04:48.300
this is a cultivation attempt 30 years ago of Donald Trump. And one more fact,

76
00:04:48.301 --> 00:04:52.110
which is kind of extraordinary two months after this Moscow trip,

77
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.060
Donald Trump takes out three adverts in American papers, Washington post,

78
00:04:57.061 --> 00:05:01.290
New York times, uh, criticizing Ronald Reagan, the president at the time,

79
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.120
and lets it be known that he is interested in becoming president of the United

80
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.680
States. Now, you know, the timeline, we don't know what was said.

81
00:05:10.681 --> 00:05:11.461
It's not clear,

82
00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:15.330
but I think what we can say is that Russia has been interested in Mr. Trump for

83
00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:16.164
a long time.

84
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.420
<v 0>Well, we, we, as you say, we don't know what this implies.</v>

85
00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:23.580
It might might imply that, or, or not at all.

86
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.850
<v 2>If they don't invite you for nothing. I mean, it's, it's this one.</v>

87
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.080
<v 0>What, what is what loan that is that they recruited people,</v>

88
00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:33.960
they approached people and even in, in, in your party,

89
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.130
they approached a lot of people. Yes. Uh, and, and did they approach you?

90
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.960
<v 3>Uh, no people, you knew if my people on you,</v>

91
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.000
even my deputy was a big deputy chairman or definitely leader of the liberal

92
00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:50.070
party he was approached. Yeah.

93
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.710
<v 2>Um, I mean, what's interesting is during this period,</v>

94
00:05:52.711 --> 00:05:56.910
there's another KGB spy and about 37, 38 years old, uh,

95
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.410
living in provincial East Germany called Vladimir Putin.

96
00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.080
And Mr. Putin is trying to do the same thing with,

97
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.310
with students from the local university who he wants to recruit and maybe

98
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:09.770
central America. And I think really to,

99
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.210
to understand kind of the extraordinary story of 2060 in the American

100
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:18.830
election, the hacking the shock defeat of Hillary Clinton Putin,

101
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:23.510
you need to go back to kind of cold war times because it's sort of like,

102
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.180
it's the same methods. It's like cold war too,

103
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.320
but for the age of Facebook and Twitter and everything else,

104
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.330
uh, the is based on, uh.

105
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.710
<v 0>A dossier or at least big parts of America is,</v>

106
00:06:38.711 --> 00:06:43.060
is by this Christopher Steele. Tell me, who is Christopher Steele?

107
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:44.650
What are the important stories?

108
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.630
<v 2>Is someone who worked for British intelligence or [inaudible] for about 20.</v>

109
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.070
<v 0>Yeah. Cooler than unit. Many times.</v>

110
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.120
<v 2>Okay. Yeah. Okay. Um, but he, he was, uh, a spy.</v>

111
00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:03.130
He was working undercover in, um, Moscow, um, in 19,

112
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.233
19, 1991.

113
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.460
<v 0>I mean, this does here is it's, it's been disputed it's,</v>

114
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.400
it's not without fault and even your,

115
00:07:12.401 --> 00:07:15.610
your own newspaper hesitated to, to publish it.

116
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.260
So how come you, you so strongly believe the content of it?

117
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:21.560
<v 2>Well, I mean,</v>

118
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:26.590
I think festival having kind of talked to people close to steal, um,

119
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.820
what I learned was that the sources he used was sources that had been reliable

120
00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:33.790
in the past, who had provided information, for example,

121
00:07:33.791 --> 00:07:36.070
about the war in Ukraine, which had turned out to be accurate.

122
00:07:36.071 --> 00:07:39.570
So they had a good track record. Um, but additionally, we, we,

123
00:07:39.571 --> 00:07:42.850
we kind of know so much more, I mean, the story has moved on. Um,

124
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.540
and we've had the white house saying nothing to see here.

125
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:50.710
There were no meetings with Russians. Now we know Donald Trump Jr.

126
00:07:50.711 --> 00:07:53.920
Trump's son had secret meetings with Russians, Jared Kushner,

127
00:07:53.921 --> 00:07:56.560
the son-in-law was doing the same thing. Um,

128
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.430
strange foreign policy advisors were running around London,

129
00:08:00.431 --> 00:08:05.200
meeting mysterious professors with Moscow connections. It's I mean, my,

130
00:08:05.201 --> 00:08:08.860
my book is kind of a nonfiction spy thriller because it's the best Shara.

131
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.740
And meanwhile, we have a special prosecutor, Robert Mueller,

132
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:16.180
who is indicting people, filing criminal charges.

133
00:08:16.181 --> 00:08:19.810
So I think, I mean, I can't speak for prestige, but,

134
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:24.400
but I think he feels quietly confident that actually has dossier broadly

135
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:25.623
is right.

136
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:30.970
<v 0>Um, even though Mr. Trump himself denies any Russian ties,</v>

137
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.160
uh, the people around him is a lot.

138
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.660
<v 2>Of things. Um.</v>

139
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:41.740
<v 0>But, but, but, but a lot of the people around him is, is obviously,</v>

140
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.850
uh, well collected or it, it, according to your right.

141
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.570
<v 2>I don't know if you've ever met Rex Tennyson, the secretary of state,</v>

142
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.433
but they have.

143
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.440
<v 0>You know, what, before he became, he's kind.</v>

144
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.060
<v 2>Of an oil guy. Yeah. He, he, he knows about oil. Um,</v>

145
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:01.980
but he has a order of friendship from Vladimir Putin that they kind of push

146
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:05.400
and gave it to him a few years ago. They kinked glasses. And suddenly,

147
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.150
I don't know. Were you surprised when Tennyson became secretary of state, um,

148
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.111
from nowhere,

149
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:14.010
but someone who's known and trusted in Moscow and the same with Michael Flynn,

150
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.840
the national security advisor who we now know while he was there's that famous

151
00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:22.410
shot of him, um, at the democratic party convention. Uh,

152
00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.590
so the Republican convention where he stands up and says about Hillary Clinton

153
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.810
lock her up, lock her up. Now we know he was actually taking money from Moscow.

154
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.490
Um, and, and one imagines that maybe he will himself be locked up at some point,

155
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.520
we'll have to see him. And yeah.

156
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:40.160
<v 0>As I mentioned, there,</v>

157
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:43.160
there are lots of characters in the book and we can't talk about them all.

158
00:09:43.161 --> 00:09:47.420
But one, I think we should talk about this. That is Mr.

159
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:52.670
<v 2>Uh, got a lot of [inaudible].</v>

160
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.120
<v 4>Yeah. So, so yeah, he's, uh, he's.</v>

161
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.100
<v 0>He's got a Russian Trump or yeah.</v>

162
00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.670
<v 2>Here's a kind of Russian chump. So, so [inaudible] is, uh,</v>

163
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.810
the he's an oligarch and he was the one who hosted Donald Trump in

164
00:10:05.811 --> 00:10:10.220
2013, invited him to the beauty pageants.

165
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.750
Did the thumbs up with Donald Trump, you know, you know,

166
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:17.150
that famous sort of thing. What then happened subsequently was, um,

167
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.630
last year during the election campaign, um, uh,

168
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:24.020
Aguilar has a son who's pop star called MN. Um,

169
00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.880
and Evan got in touch with a slightly strange British guy called Rob Goldstone.

170
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.350
Who's a sort of music publicist.

171
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.640
And there were a chain of emails that went to Donald Trump's son saying we have

172
00:10:34.641 --> 00:10:38.000
a Russian lawyer. She wants to come to New York. She wants to meet with you.

173
00:10:38.001 --> 00:10:41.360
And she has information, which from the Russian government,

174
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:45.200
which will help Donald Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton.

175
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.360
And this was the moment for Donald Trump Jr to say, no, I can't do this.

176
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:54.080
And instead he sent a famous email, which said, I love it.

177
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.730
I think he took the meeting. I love it. Um, and, and to me, I mean,

178
00:10:58.731 --> 00:11:01.220
my book is called collusion in English. This,

179
00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.180
this is kind of textbook collusion. This is isn't like Watergate,

180
00:11:05.181 --> 00:11:10.130
where you have one group of Americans doing bad things to another group of

181
00:11:10.131 --> 00:11:10.790
Americans.

182
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:14.600
This is one group of Americans requesting assistance from foreign power.

183
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:19.850
<v 0>You also have this Carter page character and not a very well-known person.</v>

184
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.970
<v 2>He's someone that the FBI was watching. They had his phones bugged. Not,</v>

185
00:11:23.971 --> 00:11:25.730
not because they didn't like his suit,

186
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.960
but because he kept on spending time with Russian spies in Manhattan in

187
00:11:29.961 --> 00:11:34.430
2013. And what's funny, I mean, it makes it kind of great chapters.

188
00:11:34.431 --> 00:11:38.300
The Russia spies didn't think very much of him and the way emails intercepted by

189
00:11:38.301 --> 00:11:42.680
the FBI, in which one, spy set of Carter Speight set of Carter page.

190
00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:47.390
I think he's a bit of an idiot. Um, he goes to Moscow more often the night,

191
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:49.791
but anyway,

192
00:11:49.791 --> 00:11:54.580
this is the matter of advising Trump on diplomacy and

193
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.580
allegedly having secret meetings in Moscow as well.

194
00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:02.310
<v 0>It's, it's, it's kind of like the plot thickens and thickens and thickens,</v>

195
00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:05.340
and still, it's hard to find the smoking gun.

196
00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:09.120
It's hard to find the hard evidence, isn't it? Well, I mean, you want.

197
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.160
<v 2>Trump and Putin in.</v>

198
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.460
<v 0>The sauna. I don't know, but it's like, it's like, it's,</v>

199
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:17.880
I don't know how are you working with this material,

200
00:12:17.881 --> 00:12:22.680
but it's hard to find that one thing [inaudible].

201
00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:26.130
<v 2>There are two sides of this plot. There's the kind of Russian side there,</v>

202
00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:29.520
the spying being done by, by Vladimir Putin's team,

203
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.820
which we'll have to wait for a long time before until the,

204
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.380
until the end of the push-in government. Then,

205
00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.650
then maybe like with the collapse of the Soviet union, we get some answers.

206
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:41.400
What's different about that. They've always been trying to do that.

207
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:45.660
What's different is that that most successful than they used to be.

208
00:12:45.661 --> 00:12:50.430
And also Facebook and Twitter means what you can do is if a country has

209
00:12:50.431 --> 00:12:54.870
problems or difficulties, you can get a whole lot of Russians sitting in St.

210
00:12:54.871 --> 00:12:57.720
Petersburg, pretending to be Americans, British people.

211
00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.460
And you can influence public opinion.

212
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.230
<v 0>W when you, when you talk about the Steele report, uh,</v>

213
00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.280
which is very important in your book, uh, you say that,

214
00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:10.920
um, approximately 70,

215
00:13:10.921 --> 00:13:15.420
80% of it is probably true and the rest is unreliable.

216
00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.260
Uh, but how, how do you know which 17%?

217
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:22.290
I think it's quite important. It's a good question. But.

218
00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:25.350
<v 2>I mean, I think, I think the thing about intelligence is it's not,</v>

219
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:29.910
it's not black or white, it's kind of gray or offline or CPO,

220
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.230
and you're relying on human sources. A lot of the time, you know,

221
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.440
humans are kind of fluid. We don't always get it right. Or remember correctly,

222
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.120
so there will be errors,

223
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:44.070
but I think still thinks is broadly correct. And, and what he did,

224
00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.580
which was quite smart was he gave all this material to American intelligence and

225
00:13:47.581 --> 00:13:49.830
said, look, I didn't have the resources to verify this,

226
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:55.080
or prove that it's wrong. You take it over. And, and he kind of lit the fuse.

227
00:13:55.081 --> 00:13:59.130
And that's why from some of last year, the FBI have been investigating.

228
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:03.870
<v 0>Parts of this book is, is things that are known. The thing is that,</v>

229
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:08.310
uh, I mean, you're kind of connecting the dots, uh,

230
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:12.690
but don't you think it's easy also for Trump supporters to say that again,

231
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:17.580
liberals here on the fake media, uh, uh,

232
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.180
bad losers, uh, again, they lost, they lost a,

233
00:14:21.181 --> 00:14:25.650
really the Republicans last time. It was also something wrong with the election.

234
00:14:25.651 --> 00:14:30.120
Now it's something wrong with the election. Sure. To kind of see that. I mean,

235
00:14:30.121 --> 00:14:30.954
I can see all that.

236
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:34.920
<v 2>On Twitter, but I don't really think it's valid.</v>

237
00:14:34.921 --> 00:14:37.520
And I think what's really important. I mean, this is a time of,

238
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.670
of fake fake news is that we have good method. Uh,

239
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.860
and that we're empirical. We,

240
00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:47.400
we follow the evidence we admit when we're wrong. Um,

241
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:51.860
we recognize that things can be complicated, but also we try and go for.

242
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:55.850
<v 0>The truth. And there are not a million truths that there is, I do,</v>

243
00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:00.920
maybe I'm old fashioned, but there is generally a trends alternative truth, but

244
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:07.370
I'm kind of protrude. Well, uh, I think this has been very interesting.

245
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.950
And, um, thank you so much, Lou Carney for coming here.

246
00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:18.550
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

247
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:23.510
<v 0>We've been talking about, uh, alpha males, uh, um, um,</v>

248
00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.190
the Russians. So I have this little clip that I wanna,

249
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:31.060
I wanna wrap up with and it's with you, you know, uh,

250
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.880

<v 1>He was strong. You couldn't see it there on that clip.</v>

256
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:04.030
He raised us on our feet from our feet when he said that,

257
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:09.280
when is that strawberry? Did you feel the smell from his mouth?
