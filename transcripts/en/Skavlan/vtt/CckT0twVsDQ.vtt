00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.550
<v 0>Amanda Knox, welcome to the, to the program.</v>

2
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.540
[inaudible], it's been three years now since, since the Supreme court in Italy,

3
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.220
um, acquitted you once and for all, for the last time. Yes. Um,

4
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.180
and, um, you were accused of, of, of being, um,

5
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.800
involved in the murder over your roommate. Yeah.

6
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.193
Uh, have you,

7
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.910
have you spoken to her family after you were, you were

8
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.393
acquitted.

9
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.210
<v 1>So difficult thing? Um,</v>

10
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.960
I have tried to find ways to reach out. Um,

11
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.340
but I'm aware that there is a very difficult line that I'm walking.

12
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.260
Um,

13
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.850
I know that her family still thinks that I am

14
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.720
involved somehow, at least that's what I've gathered.

15
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.150
And you know, a lot of exonerees deal with this problem where, you know,

16
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.700
a traumatized family is given the impression

17
00:01:13.701 --> 00:01:17.540
that you hurt them and you took something so precious away from them.

18
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.190
And they can't, you know,

19
00:01:19.191 --> 00:01:23.690
separate their emotions from their ability to like

20
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.580
rationally observe objective evidence. And, you know, that's why,

21
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.540
that's why we have a criminal justice system. And, you know, I'm,

22
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.690
I'm not alone amongst exonerees and being, um,

23
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.340
in this difficult place of wanting to reach out, wanting to make a connection,

24
00:01:40.341 --> 00:01:43.640
wanting to grieve together because, you know,

25
00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:48.170
I was never really allowed to grieve. Um, and,

26
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.580
but I also don't want to like, just call them up and be like, hi,

27
00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:56.510
I'm Amanda Knox. You ready to talk to me yet? So I feel like,

28
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.420
I feel like the best thing for me to do is to wait until I get some

29
00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:04.580
kind of sign that it's okay,

30
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.590
because I know that I know what it's like to be triggered and

31
00:02:09.591 --> 00:02:13.100
traumatized by this whole event. And I don't want to put that on them.

32
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.420
<v 0>And, and of course they, they have their verse and then their,</v>

33
00:02:17.421 --> 00:02:20.810
their idea of what happened, um, on the, um,

34
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.950
what we're going to talk about now is your, your experience. Um,

35
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.850
and the fact that there's, that this there's night of the murder, uh,

36
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.530
you were, you were staying with your boyfriend, um,

37
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.760
and you you've, you've, you've gone to Italy. You were 19 years old,

38
00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:40.010
you'd gone to Italy to just study for a year.

39
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.940
And you met this guy called Raphael and you've been together for a week.

40
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.730
And you, you, you spent the night there, as you say, uh,

41
00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:51.680
and the next morning you came back to the house.

42
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.140
<v 1>Yeah. You know, um, I came back to the house and I was carrying with me,</v>

43
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.280
you know,

44
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.720
the idea that I going to be going to [inaudible] that weekend with Raphael and

45
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:02.980
we were going to eat truffles.

46
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:07.960
And so the last thing on my mind was that I was going to be stumbling into a

47
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:10.540
tragedy. Um, so, you know,

48
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:14.110
I carried with me into my house, you know,

49
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:17.760
this confirmation bias of thinking, Oh, everything's fine.

50
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.540
<v 0>What did you, what was the first thing you saw? What was.</v>

51
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.021
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

52
00:03:22.021 --> 00:03:26.730
so I came into my house and the first thing I noticed that the door was open,

53
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.210
the door was right wide open. And I thought that was strange,

54
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.760
but I also didn't jump to the worst conclusion.

55
00:03:32.761 --> 00:03:35.850
I thought maybe the door had just been left, unlocked and blew open.

56
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.520
<v 0>It was just the two of you living in there, right? No.</v>

57
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.760
<v 1>Actually we lived with, um, two other Italian roommates.</v>

58
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.690
And so we all live together and, you know, I called out and said,

59
00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:50.340
is anyone home? No one answered. So I just went ahead with my routine.

60
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.040
And over the course of that morning,

61
00:03:53.041 --> 00:03:57.720
I discovered all of these signs that later on the police would say,

62
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.100
you're crazy for not having thought your roommate was dead.

63
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.800
<v 0>Tell me about those signs. What were the signs?</v>

64
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.090
<v 1>Yeah, they, you know, there was a few droplets of blood in my bathroom sink.</v>

65
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.360
There was a little blood on a bath mat. Um,

66
00:04:12.361 --> 00:04:17.130
and there was some feces left in a second bathroom. And, you.

67
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.963
<v 0>Know.</v>

68
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:24.360
<v 1>At the time I did not think that I was</v>

69
00:04:24.361 --> 00:04:26.370
coming home to my friend being murdered.

70
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.970
I thought what anyone would think when they came home and saw like a few

71
00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:33.120
speckles of blood here and there, like maybe someone had cut themselves,

72
00:04:33.121 --> 00:04:35.940
maybe someone hadn't been brushing their teeth well enough and their gums were

73
00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:37.170
bleeding. You know,

74
00:04:37.171 --> 00:04:41.700
I did not jump to this incredible conclusion that like,

75
00:04:41.701 --> 00:04:44.880
to me, nothing bad had ever happened to me in my life.

76
00:04:44.881 --> 00:04:49.530
So the idea that like my friend had been murdered was completely

77
00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:50.364
insane to me.

78
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.300
<v 0>So what, what, what was the turning point here? When did,</v>

79
00:04:54.301 --> 00:04:56.280
when did you realize something was very wrong?

80
00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.030
<v 1>You know, I,</v>

81
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.660
I had the feeling that something was up and I didn't know what it was. Um,

82
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.430
especially when I saw the feces in the toilet. So I went back and asked Rafael,

83
00:05:08.431 --> 00:05:11.220
like, what do you think? And he said, well, call your roommates. Of course,

84
00:05:11.221 --> 00:05:15.920
like, see it. Yeah. I went back to his house and then we went back together.

85
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.460
And when we went back together,

86
00:05:17.461 --> 00:05:21.780
that's when we found that a window had been broken and this room,

87
00:05:21.781 --> 00:05:26.340
this one single room had been rifled through and we thought, Oh my God,

88
00:05:26.341 --> 00:05:29.580
we've been burglarized. Except my room was fined.

89
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.840
Laura's room was fine. And we couldn't open Meredith store.

90
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.910
So we tried to open Meredith store and then eventually Rafael called the police.

91
00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:41.010
I didn't even know how to call the police at that time.

92
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.270
And I called my mom and I called my roommates and we tried to make sense of what

93
00:05:45.271 --> 00:05:46.104
was happening.

94
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.130
And that's when the police arrived and broke down her door and found her body.

95
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.630
<v 0>And you were there, right? You were outside.</v>

96
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.270
<v 1>I was there. I did not see her body. Thank goodness. Um,</v>

97
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.970
although, you know, later on in the trial,

98
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:05.780
I obviously had to see the crime scene footage and it's a horrible,

99
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.520
it's a horrible crime scene. There's blood everywhere. You know, she,

100
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.833
she was,

101
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.410
she apparently fought and struggled for her life and you know,

102
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.830
it, my,

103
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.270
my roommates that did see screamed and cried

104
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.100
for me in that moment,

105
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.840
I was just overwhelmed by trying to keep track of everything that was coming at

106
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:36.800
me, you know? And, you know, in hindsight, I feel,

107
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.120
I feel silly for not having like put together the pieces,

108
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:42.980
but really truly

109
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:49.220
my own confirmation bias coming into that situation was everything's okay,

110
00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:51.170
this is a normal day. And it wasn't,

111
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.510
and that turned into this interesting relationship with the police who like,

112
00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.430
they came into the situation with a crime scene and a body and a

113
00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:03.230
terrible bloody mess.

114
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:08.390
And so they immediately started casting about for worst case scenarios looking

115
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:09.320
about at us.

116
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.380
<v 0>Yeah. And you and Rafael came under suspicion quite soon. Yeah. Um,</v>

117
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.020
we have no idea. No, but later on you learn that this, this was also about,

118
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.740
it was about your behavior first your behavior at the crime scene.

119
00:07:23.741 --> 00:07:24.790
What was that behavior?

120
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.290
<v 1>You know, there's this three second clip that, um,</v>

121
00:07:29.291 --> 00:07:32.950
I'm sure you've seen anyone who's followed the case has seen it this three

122
00:07:32.951 --> 00:07:37.720
second clip where Rafael was outside of the house with

123
00:07:37.721 --> 00:07:40.840
me, it was cold. I was shivering. I was,

124
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.860
I was on the verge of tears. I was trying to figure out what's going on.

125
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.720
So he put his jacket over me and rubbed my shoulders and kissed me three times.

126
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.930
And the kind of incredible thing about this story is the, you know,

127
00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:55.150
the media decided,

128
00:07:55.151 --> 00:07:59.200
especially the tabloid media decided to really strip me of context,

129
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.700
to not show, you know, the hours of time that I was there, helping the police.

130
00:08:03.701 --> 00:08:07.900
They just really honed in on that three second clip of Raphael kissing me and

131
00:08:07.901 --> 00:08:11.800
zoomed in on it and slow mode. And, you know, like, you know,

132
00:08:11.801 --> 00:08:13.480
really just put it on repeat.

133
00:08:13.481 --> 00:08:17.860
So everyone had this impression of me as like this girl who was just kissing all

134
00:08:17.861 --> 00:08:21.040
the time and it wasn't true, you know,

135
00:08:21.041 --> 00:08:25.870
like I was there and I was doing truly what I

136
00:08:25.871 --> 00:08:29.350
thought was going to help. I was doing my best.

137
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.270
And I had no idea that the police had their own confirmation

138
00:08:34.271 --> 00:08:38.500
bias being brought into the equation. They were looking for a murderer.

139
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.230
They were looking for a monster. And so their,

140
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.320
their glasses were tinted that they're silence.

141
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.620
<v 0>So you have this Italian prosecutor, he,</v>

142
00:08:46.621 --> 00:08:50.560
he had a theory about what had happened.

143
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:56.010
And he stuck to that theory for a long time. He did. And he told.

144
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.150
<v 1>Me about that. Yeah. You know,</v>

145
00:08:57.151 --> 00:09:01.320
he stuck to his guns despite overwhelming evidence that pointed to the contrary.

146
00:09:01.321 --> 00:09:06.030
But, you know, we've all heard this story Foxy, Knoxy the femme fatale,

147
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.640
the adulterous Lucifer, Rina.

148
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:13.650
I was depicted as this who was so jealous of

149
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:17.490
Meredith's purity that I decided to rape and kill her.

150
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.930
That was the story.

151
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.970
And it what's incredible at this story is it didn't take into consideration that

152
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:29.010
there was no genetic trace of me at the crime scene.

153
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.410
So.

154
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:33.950
<v 0>First they thought it was, but that was contemplated. Yeah.</v>

155
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.480
<v 1>They, they thought that they had a knife that may have had my DNA on it,</v>

156
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:43.250
but they knew from the beginning that my DNA was nowhere in

157
00:09:43.251 --> 00:09:47.870
Meredith's room where she had been brutally raped and murdered. So they just,

158
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.610
you know, disregarded that and decided to focus on how can we,

159
00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.980
how can we imagine and depict this young woman who is sexually active

160
00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.940
as this femme fatale, how can we put her in conflict?

161
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:03.920
And it's interesting because, you know,

162
00:10:03.921 --> 00:10:08.900
there was this Madonna dichotomy and that false dichotomy was

163
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.320
pushed out into the world. And, and, you know,

164
00:10:12.321 --> 00:10:17.240
people were genuinely intrigued and interested by a story of

165
00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:18.470
two young girls,

166
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.480
maybe some sexual things going on and then ends in murder. And.

167
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:29.360
<v 0>And meanwhile, while, while all the world was reading about this, you, you,</v>

168
00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:33.220
you were, uh, uh, held in custody in Italy and,

169
00:10:33.221 --> 00:10:35.570
and you were interrogated quite, quite a lot.

170
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:36.890
<v 1>Yes. I,</v>

171
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:41.780
in the five days from discovering Meredith's death and my

172
00:10:41.781 --> 00:10:43.190
arrest, I was,

173
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:48.200
I was interrogated for 53 hours and I was interrogated in a

174
00:10:48.201 --> 00:10:51.560
language that I understood about as well as a ten-year-old. Yeah.

175
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.360
And I,

176
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.040
in that interrogation didn't even understand that I was a suspect because the

177
00:10:58.041 --> 00:11:02.960
police told me that I was an important witness and that I was helping them. And,

178
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:03.801
you know,

179
00:11:03.801 --> 00:11:08.630
over the course of a very brutal interrogation hit me and

180
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:13.400
threatened me within prison because they said that I was hiding the murderer or

181
00:11:13.401 --> 00:11:16.820
that I had amnesia. And couldn't remember who the murderer was.

182
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.940
<v 0>And then at one point Raphael changed his story. Didn't they?</v>

183
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.590
<v 1>Well, what I've understood from what he's,</v>

184
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:29.990
what he's spoken out about is that they were putting him through the very same,

185
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.540
very dreadful interrogation.

186
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:37.550
And they pushed him to agree that while he was

187
00:11:37.551 --> 00:11:41.810
asleep, he couldn't say that I was with him.

188
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.670
And so he signed a statement saying that, yes, while he was asleep,

189
00:11:46.671 --> 00:11:49.130
he couldn't say I was there with him.

190
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:52.850
And then the cops came to my room and said,

191
00:11:52.851 --> 00:11:55.750
your boyfriend has turned against you. We know you're a liar.

192
00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:00.640
You need to tell us what we already know. We know you went out that night,

193
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.110
we know you met with someone.

194
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.770
<v 0>What w what did you do? Did you stick to your story? Or did you.</v>

195
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.930
<v 1>I mean, by that point,</v>

196
00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:12.120
I was so scared and confused that I did not know

197
00:12:12.121 --> 00:12:14.100
what was the truth anymore. Like,

198
00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:19.620
I don't know if you've ever had this experience, but, and amazingly,

199
00:12:19.621 --> 00:12:22.200
this happens so often in wrongful convictions,

200
00:12:22.201 --> 00:12:26.700
almost one in four wrongfully convicted people end up giving false admissions.

201
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:30.270
But what the police tell you is we know what the truth is.

202
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.420
You don't remember the truth. Let us tell you what the truth is.

203
00:12:33.421 --> 00:12:36.660
And if you don't agree to it, you're never getting out of prison again.

204
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:41.310
And so they made me believe that I had forgotten what happened because I was so

205
00:12:41.311 --> 00:12:43.890
traumatized and I genuine. And they,

206
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:49.080
what they asked me to do was to not keep telling them the same story,

207
00:12:49.081 --> 00:12:53.370
but to imagine something else, imagine what the truth was.

208
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:58.560
And the only thing that I could do was react to what they were telling me.

209
00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:03.570
I very genuinely could not believe that the police were lying to me,

210
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.370
that they would manipulate me.

211
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.160
<v 0>But the fact, the fact that they, they, they,</v>

212
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:12.690
they leaked your diary to the press.

213
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.600
What do you think was the effect of that? How do you,

214
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:17.430
how much do you think that had to say?

215
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.090
<v 1>Yeah. Um, I think that,</v>

216
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:26.250
I think that it meant that they had decided I was guilty long before any

217
00:13:26.251 --> 00:13:29.910
evidence came into play. I think that they were trying to scare me.

218
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.740
I think they were trying to not only manipulate me and pressure me to say things

219
00:13:34.741 --> 00:13:36.750
and admit to things, but also to like,

220
00:13:36.751 --> 00:13:41.700
give this idea of me and the world that really sustained their theory of

221
00:13:41.701 --> 00:13:45.750
a sex game gone wrong. They had boyfriends, or yes,

222
00:13:45.751 --> 00:13:48.450
I wrote about my boyfriends and I wrote about a lot of things.

223
00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:53.460
I was writing a diary and they decided to

224
00:13:53.461 --> 00:13:56.190
convey to the world that, you know, this,

225
00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:01.140
this list that I had of other men that I'd ever slept with in my whole

226
00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:05.220
entire life actually meant the number of men that I had slept with in a week in

227
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:10.170
Perugia. And what a look she'll do anything. And what's fascinating is they,

228
00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.480
they attacked me through my sexuality.

229
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:17.370
So because I was a young woman who is sexually active,

230
00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:22.010
that to them meant that I was already guilty and that guilty things

231
00:14:22.011 --> 00:14:25.500
snowballed. If I had sex with people, I could be guilty of anything.

232
00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:32.190
<v 0>You were, you were convicted to 26 years of prison.</v>

233
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:35.400
Yeah. Can you describe that moment?

234
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:41.160
<v 1>Um, I'm glad you asked about that moment because, um, you know,</v>

235
00:14:41.161 --> 00:14:44.460
I was in prison for two years leading up to that verdict.

236
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:47.460
And throughout those two years,

237
00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:50.970
I was so sure that everything was going to turn out all.

238
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.550
I was so sure that it didn't matter that like I was being portrayed in this

239
00:14:55.551 --> 00:14:59.750
crazy way, because it wasn't true and what was true mattered.

240
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.850
And my innocence would save me.

241
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.900
And so when the verdict was handed down,

242
00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.870
I, um, I was,

243
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:17.060
I was crushed and not just crushed, like, you know,

244
00:15:17.061 --> 00:15:19.460
that physical weight that hits you, which it did,

245
00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:24.320
but like I was crushed in an existential way. This,

246
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:28.010
the whole world had decided that I was guilty.

247
00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.340
And so they had effectively rewritten reality.

248
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.300
They had rewrote my past and my present and my future.

249
00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:39.350
And suddenly I was faced with the prospect of, Oh,

250
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.190
I'm not just an innocent person. Who's just waiting to go home.

251
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.880
I'm a prisoner and prison is my home.

252
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.540
And the truth doesn't matter. And.

253
00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:54.130
<v 0>So it was like this Dawn on you that very moment.</v>

254
00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.680
<v 1>Yeah. I, until that moment,</v>

255
00:15:56.681 --> 00:16:01.300
I was so sure that the courtroom was kind of like a scientific laboratory where

256
00:16:01.301 --> 00:16:05.110
a bunch of information gets boiled down to truth beyond a reasonable doubt.

257
00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:06.251
And in fact,

258
00:16:06.251 --> 00:16:10.990
what I discovered is the courtroom was a battleground of storytelling where like

259
00:16:10.991 --> 00:16:15.610
the most emotionally compelling story and not necessarily the most truthful

260
00:16:15.611 --> 00:16:17.620
wins. And so, you know,

261
00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:22.270
the prosecution and the tabloid media came up with a story that people loved.

262
00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:27.130
People loved Foxy Knoxy they loved to hate her and they

263
00:16:27.131 --> 00:16:30.820
sentenced her, but that they couldn't, you know,

264
00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:34.750
take this invented person and put her in prison. That was me.

265
00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:37.870
I was the one who had to go back to the prison van.

266
00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:43.000
I was the one who had to go back to the bars and the barbed

267
00:16:43.001 --> 00:16:45.070
wire and the loneliness.

268
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:54.490
<v 0>It's, um, it's in a way, it's a story about,</v>

269
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.870
about much more than, than a new,

270
00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:01.780
it's a story about conception and how,

271
00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:05.680
how tragedy can be turned into some kind of big entertainment,

272
00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:10.720
because I look back on a lot of the coverage and the

273
00:17:10.721 --> 00:17:13.440
tragedy in a way it's all gone. It's,

274
00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:17.950
it's really like, I don't know if do you ever,

275
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:21.460
did you ever read about it later? Did you see some of the coverage later?

276
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.310
<v 1>I mean, I was aware that there was a lot of coverage,</v>

277
00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:28.300
but not to the extent that I saw when I got out.

278
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.060
Um, you know,

279
00:17:31.061 --> 00:17:35.980
that became very apparent to me when I was being chased by paparazzi for

280
00:17:35.981 --> 00:17:37.990
months, or I couldn't, you know,

281
00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:41.410
go outside my mom's house without them waiting for me.

282
00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.500
They're waiting to like yell things at me. Like,

283
00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.660
do you think Meredith has been forgotten?

284
00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:52.320
And the idea that I had to answer for their coverage of

285
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:56.850
the case seemed to fly completely over their heads. You know, um,

286
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.990
I think that something that happens when someone is accused of a terrible crime

287
00:18:03.991 --> 00:18:05.490
and a terrible crime happens,

288
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.390
we tend to stop treating those people.

289
00:18:09.391 --> 00:18:12.420
Like we would someone else we've decided that they're an other.

290
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.340
And as soon as they're in other, all those like negative emotions that,

291
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.410
and fears and fantasies that we have,

292
00:18:19.411 --> 00:18:22.770
we feel entitled to project them onto that person.

293
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.880
And we don't give them the benefit of the doubt because emotionally we're just

294
00:18:26.881 --> 00:18:30.510
triggered that way. And I don't think that that means that we're bad.

295
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:35.190
I just think that that means we're human and we make this mistake over and over

296
00:18:35.191 --> 00:18:38.190
and over again. And, you know,

297
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.280
I never thought this kind of thing happened until it happened to me.

298
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.530
And then I came home and I was introduced to hundreds of

299
00:18:46.531 --> 00:18:48.990
other men and women,

300
00:18:48.991 --> 00:18:53.970
but mostly black men in my country who had been depicted

301
00:18:53.971 --> 00:18:56.430
as monsters when they were really just people.

302
00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:58.860
And another thing I learned was like,

303
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:03.330
I lived alongside actual killers and actual thieves.

304
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:07.090
<v 0>In the brilliant prison. You spent a total of how long in prison?</v>

305
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.240
<v 1>Four years. Yeah. And, you know,</v>

306
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:15.440
I was living alongside people who had done terrible things,

307
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:17.060
but they were people too.

308
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.570
And that's something that I don't think people really think about.

309
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:22.640
<v 0>Do you think those four years</v>

310
00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:25.850
and the eight years that this,

311
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.590
this case took over your life in a way before you were acquitted finally. Yeah.

312
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:36.110
Do you, uh, how has it shaped you? How has it changed you?

313
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.470
<v 1>Gosh. Um, well,</v>

314
00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:43.040
I can tell you that I did not want to be the girl who was wrongly accused of

315
00:19:43.041 --> 00:19:47.600
murder. That was not something that I ever aspired to. Um,

316
00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.070
and very honestly,

317
00:19:49.071 --> 00:19:52.070
when I was released from prison and I was allowed to come home,

318
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:57.530
even though I was still on trial and I was facing another four years of

319
00:19:57.531 --> 00:20:01.970
trial, um, I wanted the life that I had before,

320
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:05.790
because I didn't like the idea that who I was was,

321
00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.780
was defined by something that just happened to me,

322
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:13.640
not by something I did or something that I deserved, but like,

323
00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:14.630
you know,

324
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:19.490
I went back to school and no matter how many poetry classes I took there,

325
00:20:19.491 --> 00:20:21.770
it was staring me in the face.

326
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.980
The fact that I had pain and fury,

327
00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:30.170
the fact that I would forever be associated with Meredith's

328
00:20:30.171 --> 00:20:31.880
death, whether it was true or not.

329
00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:36.590
<v 0>There, there is a man in jail for this murder today. Uh,</v>

330
00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.420
and you are acquitted,

331
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:42.320
but do you feel that you are totally acquitted in the public eye?

332
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:46.550
<v 1>It depends on who you ask. Right? Um,</v>

333
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.870
when I'm living my day to day life,

334
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:54.010
I feel very seen by the people who are close to me.

335
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.680
That doesn't mean that the world knows the

336
00:20:59.681 --> 00:21:02.530
truth about what happened to Meredith, you know, for

337
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.040
the man who committed this murder,

338
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:10.780
he left DNA all over Meredith spotty.

339
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:15.850
He left his footprints and fingerprints in her blood, in the crime scene.

340
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:19.690
He was a burglar who was known to commit crimes like these.

341
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:24.130
And yet for all the international attention,

342
00:21:24.131 --> 00:21:27.430
this case received very few people know his name.

343
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.230
His name is Rudy, good day. He murdered Meredith,

344
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.900
but the public and the prosecution and the tabloid media all decided to focus

345
00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:39.850
on me instead as if,

346
00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:44.530
as if my demeanor or what clothes I was wearing that day, or what might,

347
00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.040
you know, what it looked like if I was looking this way or that way,

348
00:21:48.041 --> 00:21:52.270
somehow held some deep truth about what happened. And that's not true.

349
00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.340
There was evidence there to look at.

350
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:59.880
<v 0>And, um, this is part of your, your life today, is that under the,</v>

351
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:05.100
um, part of the reason you sit here is that you work with other women

352
00:22:05.101 --> 00:22:09.510
that has been, you talk a lot with other women that has been shamed in,

353
00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.120
uh, in, in, in the public eye.

354
00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:17.310
<v 1>I've become very sensitive to how women's narratives are stolen from them.</v>

355
00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.980
<v 0>Can you, what can you say to them? What do.</v>

356
00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.490
<v 1>Well, one thing I can say is,</v>

357
00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:27.480
I know another thing that I can say is, look,

358
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:33.330
I understand better than anyone that if you are stripped of context

359
00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:37.380
and no one treats you with compassion, like another human being,

360
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.200
you're no one's ever going to really see you.

361
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.890
And the truth is never going to be really known because the two dimensional,

362
00:22:43.891 --> 00:22:48.390
tabloid versions of ourselves that are out there in the world, they don't,

363
00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:52.440
they don't represent us. So, you know,

364
00:22:52.441 --> 00:22:56.940
when I set out to tell the stories of other women who had been treated

365
00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:58.170
similarly to me,

366
00:22:58.830 --> 00:23:03.390
I've thought I was facing this terrible uphill battle who would ever care what

367
00:23:03.391 --> 00:23:07.170
Foxy Knoxy had to say about some other train wreck woman.

368
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:12.150
Surprisingly people responded very well.

369
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:17.550
I think a lot of women have been waiting to confront something that's

370
00:23:17.551 --> 00:23:22.260
felt wrong all along this exploitation of women's bodies and stories.

371
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.720
And when they finally saw someone who had felt it on their own skin in a

372
00:23:27.721 --> 00:23:32.400
really bad way, just say, um, no, I'm a person here.

373
00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:36.270
She is too. Like, it's very easy to humanize someone.

374
00:23:36.271 --> 00:23:41.190
You just have to sit in a room with them. It's it's my job is not that hard.

375
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:46.010
I just have to be there and be a human with them and care. You.

376
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.680
<v 0>Have to describe your story as a modern day witch hunt.</v>

377
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:52.360
<v 1>Yeah. Um, well I think that,</v>

378
00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:57.910
I think that I was treated like a monster and that people

379
00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:02.620
felt entitled to hunt me down.

380
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:07.600
I felt hunted down for my entire adult life.

381
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:12.790
And the moment that the Italian Supreme court fully acquitted me

382
00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:15.370
for having nothing to do with this crime,

383
00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:20.200
I cannot tell you the relief. And you know,

384
00:24:20.201 --> 00:24:23.440
that didn't mean that I suddenly, you know,

385
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:27.070
everything was gone and everything was okay because I was still entering into a

386
00:24:27.071 --> 00:24:32.050
world who had S had seen Foxy Knoxy and was ready to judge

387
00:24:32.051 --> 00:24:32.231
her.

388
00:24:32.231 --> 00:24:37.150
And so I knew that like every person I would meet from now on would have already

389
00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.100
judged me before ever meeting me.

390
00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:42.910
<v 0>Do do, do you still, do you still struggle with, with this?</v>

391
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:45.850
<v 1>Um, I do. Um,</v>

392
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:51.370
it's interesting because I think the story has become more complex.

393
00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:55.300
People have been given access to, uh,

394
00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.590
to not just the prosecution story, but to the bigger story.

395
00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:04.930
And what I'm trying to do is show how this isn't just an isolated incident,

396
00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:09.790
but like part of like this bigger issue that we have of who do we

397
00:25:09.791 --> 00:25:14.410
treat as someone like ourselves and who would we treat as other and why do we do

398
00:25:14.411 --> 00:25:15.880
it? And is this a mistake?

399
00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:21.790
I think it is a big mistake and there are incredibly terrible consequences.

400
00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.040
<v 0>And th this is why you want to talk to all the people,</v>

401
00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.750
all the people that has been shamed,

402
00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:30.310
other people that have been victims of similar, similar things. Yeah.

403
00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:34.120
Um, has it been difficult and I'm asking you,

404
00:25:34.121 --> 00:25:38.950
because I met your boyfriend like backstage here, has it been difficult to,

405
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.990
to start again, to trust people again, to, to just start a new,

406
00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.220
new life in a way after this?

407
00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:47.770
<v 1>Yeah. Um, funnily enough,</v>

408
00:25:47.771 --> 00:25:52.750
I'm I have a really nice origin story with my boyfriend.

409
00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.570
Can I share it with you? Yeah. Um,

410
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:59.230
so for a while I was writing, um,

411
00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:03.010
arts correspondence for a local newspaper. And when I first started there,

412
00:26:03.011 --> 00:26:07.630
I was writing anonymously because I did not want anyone to like, be mean to me.

413
00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.330
But after a while, I started writing under my own name.

414
00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:13.840
And I was given this book, this advanced copy of a debut novel,

415
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:16.060
and I read it and I reviewed it,

416
00:26:16.061 --> 00:26:18.850
and it was hilarious and heartbreaking and funny and smart.

417
00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.000
And I wrote this great review and that was going to be the end of it.

418
00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:26.200
Except the very next day I walked out of my apartment and across the street,

419
00:26:26.201 --> 00:26:30.760
I saw this poster for this book reading for this exact book that I had just

420
00:26:30.761 --> 00:26:33.310
read. And so I said, Hey, I'm not doing anything tonight.

421
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.470
I'm going to go to this book reading. So I did,

422
00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.220
and I witnessed like this beautiful bromance between these two best friends who

423
00:26:39.221 --> 00:26:41.770
had written a novel together, Chris and Gavin,

424
00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:45.900
and I immediately them for an interview. So they said, sure, that's great.

425
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:49.380
So I went to their house. I was sitting across from them just like you,

426
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.590
and did the interview, had the questions ready,

427
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:57.600
but then that kind of devolved into drinking scotch and watching star Trek,

428
00:26:57.601 --> 00:27:01.410
and then wandering out into the neighborhood into the night. And it,

429
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.620
it was the most fun. And at the end of the night,

430
00:27:04.621 --> 00:27:08.760
Gavin gave me this big bear hug and Chris shook my hand and said,

431
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:09.930
we should be friends.

432
00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:14.760
And that was maybe a month or two after I had been fully acquitted.

433
00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:19.620
And the idea that I could have friends that I could just meet people out in the

434
00:27:19.621 --> 00:27:24.540
world and they could be my peers and we could have a connection, um,

435
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.730
was so new to me that was not something that I could do when I was

436
00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:31.530
on trial. And then, you know,

437
00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:35.670
we became friends and then nine months later we started dating and we've been

438
00:27:35.671 --> 00:27:39.300
together ever since. So yeah.

439
00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:44.683
<v 0>[Inaudible] so much, I</v>

440
00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:49.760
