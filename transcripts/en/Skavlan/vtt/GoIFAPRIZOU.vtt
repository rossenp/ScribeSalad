WEBVTT

1
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.250
<v 0>[Inaudible] Oh, hold on. I've got it. We've got to speak English. Sure. Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.430
The thing is that you understand Swedish and do you speak Swedish,

3
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.300
but you prefer English because he grew up in, in America. Um,

4
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.520
your, your father, if we saw him in the clip hair. Yeah.

5
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.600
He was a pioneer in commercial television. Uh, he changed the, the,

6
00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:42.510
the sort of television world in Scandinavia and, and, uh,

7
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.720
among other things with TV tree. Uh,

8
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.240
and you are not often a guest on television? No, not at all. No. Uh,

9
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.360
but when you, when you were to come here as a guest,

10
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.310
what was your worst nightmare that could happen?

11
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.730
<v 1>Well, first it's, uh, it's it's SVT, so you never know. No. Uh,</v>

12
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.661
but I think,

13
00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:07.400
I thought back to when a T3 first launched and my aunt who was foreign

14
00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:08.450
minister, um,

15
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.440
went on television and she appeared with another mysterious guests that she

16
00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:17.420
hadn't been warned about, which was someone who was a professional Forter.

17
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.170
So you can imagine the surprise when my very capable, very talented,

18
00:01:24.171 --> 00:01:29.030
very serious aunt as foreign minister went on the brother's television station

19
00:01:29.031 --> 00:01:33.260
with someone who I believe was 14, a song next to her.

20
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.420
And it gave him great joy. He media brought him a lot of joy,

21
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.100
um, but it is my worst nightmare.

22
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.020
So I've seen the guests in the green room and there were no such activities

23
00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:45.860
going on backstage.

24
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.600
<v 0>Um, but it wasn't the eighties. So the world was so different than the eighties.</v>

25
00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:57.860
Wasn't it? Uh, let's go back. Not that far, but go,

26
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.040
let's go back to, to 2002. Um,

27
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.940
your father passed away very suddenly. Yes. Uh,

28
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.650
and you were 24 years old and you were to take over this company.

29
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.020
Uh, can you,

30
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.130
can you describe that coming into that boardroom for the first time as head of

31
00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:16.964
the company?

32
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.430
<v 1>Well, it was not as apparent as that, that, that if I didn't try at least,</v>

33
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.480
uh, and put myself forward, then somebody else inevitably would have, right.

34
00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:31.250
So it wasn't so much an error parent as a, as it feels 14 years later. But,

35
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.920
um, it was a very tumultuous time.

36
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.790
It was very sad time for obviously me and for my family,

37
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.990
but in a way, um, we picked ourselves up as a group of, of, uh,

38
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.860
executives and a group of companies and we banded together and I think we have a

39
00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:47.480
very, very strong, you know, culture.

40
00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:51.320
So I felt supported even at that young age. And, um,

41
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.790
I think if I knew now what I kind of knew, then what I know now,

42
00:02:55.791 --> 00:02:58.280
I probably wouldn't have tried, but, um, why, why is that?

43
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.940
Because I think businesses it's complex, you know,

44
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:03.850
there are lots of people that depend on you. Um,

45
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.900
we have 80,000 employees around the world in 80 countries and you have a

46
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:12.550
tremendous sense of, of duty and that moment to, to step in and try.

47
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.500
<v 0>W were they ready for you? The rest of the board? I mean, it was,</v>

48
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.380
this was came very sudden for them as well. It was a very different.

49
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.820
<v 1>Yeah. And I think for that, I feel immense gratitude today. Um,</v>

50
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.440
because I think that they signed up for a 59 year old entrepreneur,

51
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.130
uh, a man that, you know, two plots and the man that, uh,

52
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.610
was constantly thinking about what, what was lying ahead.

53
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.760
And instead they got a very young 24 year old me.

54
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.420
So I think the fact that they even stuck with the businesses, uh,

55
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.810
shows that the no one's bigger than the company. And, um,

56
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.130
and I'm very grateful for that.

57
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.560
<v 0>In the midst of all this. W D how did you find the time to do,</v>

58
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.833
to mourn your father?

59
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.710
<v 1>It was difficult. I think Everett is a very individual thing, as you know,</v>

60
00:03:58.711 --> 00:04:02.550
and I think that, um, I was able to do that through, through the businesses,

61
00:04:02.551 --> 00:04:04.140
to an extent it really felt,

62
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.130
and I think to a large extent is still like a family. Um, so there,

63
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.900
when you're an entrepreneurial group, like us,

64
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.870
people have worked for 25 years in some of these companies.

65
00:04:12.871 --> 00:04:17.250
So I was able to live and, and be close to him and his legacy through,

66
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.250
through that business. It sounds funny, but it,

67
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.590
unless you're in a family business, it's a very particular feeling,

68
00:04:22.591 --> 00:04:26.160
but I think going there and being with the people that he had spent so much time

69
00:04:26.161 --> 00:04:30.180
building companies and creating value with was in a way cathartic, right.

70
00:04:30.181 --> 00:04:32.850
It was not traditional. I wouldn't recommend it for people,

71
00:04:32.851 --> 00:04:34.110
but I had years of that.

72
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.500
And eventually you get to it eventually you're able to mourn.

73
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.450
<v 0>In what way would you say that you are different from him as a</v>

74
00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:49.170
person? I mean, uh, not only as a leader, but as a person.

75
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.890
<v 1>Um, I would say that I'm a, I'm quite a sensitive person. Um, so I think that,</v>

76
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.220
you know, I take things quite personally and I, you know,

77
00:04:59.221 --> 00:05:03.000
want to do a very good job and I'm overly prepared and I worry about things.

78
00:05:03.001 --> 00:05:05.370
I think my father gave an impression that, you know,

79
00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:08.190
he was creating things for the first time. So when you're a pioneer,

80
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.490
you're not worrying about what other people do because it's so difficult.

81
00:05:11.491 --> 00:05:13.770
Probably no one else is doing it. So I'm worried about,

82
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.410
I don't want to go first, but I don't want to be last.

83
00:05:16.411 --> 00:05:19.740
I don't want to miss the train. And so I think, um,

84
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.270
I'm quite a sensitive person and he, he was that way as well,

85
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.100
but I think it was less apparent in business.

86
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.990
<v 0>You like him, you, you are, um,</v>

87
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.130
investing a lot of money in new technology and he was as well.

88
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.650
And the technology we had back then, uh, and, and, um,

89
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.810
just now we can,

90
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.850
we can see you in this project where one can sort of live through your eyes.

91
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.140
One can, one can be in your head and see things from your perspective, uh,

92
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.390
through technology. Uh, and,

93
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.220
and would you say that this technology is the next big thing?

94
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.050
<v 1>This is about, um,</v>

95
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.820
connecting connectivity and about agreeing to become an avatar,

96
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.220
uh, whereby for one hour, um, our customers and people who,

97
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.020
um,

98
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.010
log on can get inside my helmet and my head and see a day

99
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.270
in my life.

100
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.310
<v 0>Is it, would you say that that is the future? Are you, are you in, uh,</v>

101
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.590
involved in that kind of projects in the future?

102
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.770
<v 1>So in, uh, in healthcare, for example,</v>

103
00:06:26.771 --> 00:06:30.640
one of the things that we've just invested in is about, uh, offering health,

104
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.480
both diagnosis and advice through the mobile phone, which was very much,

105
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:38.890
my father's big bet in life was mobile technology, uh, as you know,

106
00:06:38.891 --> 00:06:41.410
up here in Sweden. Um, but it's to create,

107
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.500
give health advice through the creation of an avatar. Absolutely.

108
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.790
<v 0>So Y Y Y health, is that,</v>

109
00:06:48.791 --> 00:06:51.160
is that also because of, I mean,

110
00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:54.250
your personal story with your father passing away too early in life,

111
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.000
is that a part of the reason that you want to invest in health? You want to,

112
00:06:58.001 --> 00:06:59.380
you want to go go.

113
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.210
<v 1>I think after 14 years of business, uh,</v>

114
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.870
you,

115
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.070
you have a choice to either become a little bit cynical or to reinvent yourself.

116
00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.090
And so I think that what I realized with our company is that you have to,

117
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.900
you have to shape it and mold it into something that you really care about it.

118
00:07:16.901 --> 00:07:20.470
You can't have it be your father's company or your, your grandfather's company,

119
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.070
uh, and really change like we have. And so to that extent,

120
00:07:24.071 --> 00:07:28.120
I'd rather be investing in technology that enables education,

121
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.250
that enables, um, uh,

122
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.750
healthcare that democratizes the same way that mobile telephony did 20 years

123
00:07:34.751 --> 00:07:38.710
ago. So it's natural. I think, to go into those areas, I love entertainment,

124
00:07:38.711 --> 00:07:42.190
but you can't be in, in just the media, media business forever. I don't think.

125
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.690
<v 0>You have, um, I mean, you,</v>

126
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.980
what you have is a long backstory of this company and it's been a family

127
00:07:50.981 --> 00:07:54.880
company, uh, and through,

128
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.130
through history that has been difficult. I mean,

129
00:07:57.131 --> 00:08:00.730
it was difficult for your father taking over the company. Uh,

130
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:04.750
was it difficult for you as well? The fact that it was a family company and,

131
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.520
and, and you have siblings.

132
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.450
<v 1>It's, um, it's never easy. I think there are,</v>

133
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.870
there's a small group of people out there who hopefully we can support each

134
00:08:13.871 --> 00:08:17.410
other, but that, that go into this family business with their eyes wide open.

135
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.350
Um, and I think that it is, it is tricky.

136
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:23.230
<v 0>And, and you bought out the others.</v>

137
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.190
<v 1>There's still, yeah, I've got brothers and sisters and they're still, um,</v>

138
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.510
shareholders, um, but, uh, but smaller than, than I am and, um,

139
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.680
they're active and in their way, I think they wanted to have creative freedom.

140
00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:38.770
Just like, um, you would have probably if you were my brother. Yeah.

141
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.850
<v 0>Does it, does it affect what kind of sister you are,</v>

142
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:44.710
the fact that you are the boss of the company?

143
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.840
<v 1>I think I can be a better sister, definitely. Uh, 14 years later.</v>

144
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.020
I think that you, you can't do everything with, uh,

145
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:55.950
the same amount of priorities. And I had my own family, I had the business,

146
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:57.750
and so I hope now I can be,

147
00:08:57.751 --> 00:09:00.900
I can be a great sister now that the business is stabilized. You could say.

148
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:06.560
<v 0>Th th th the thing is that, that you you've when you took over,</v>

149
00:09:06.561 --> 00:09:09.650
and when you, when your father died, you,

150
00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.760
there was one brother that you didn't know about. Uh,

151
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.460
how, how did you handle that?

152
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.690
<v 1>It was, um, I think with time, you, uh,</v>

153
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.710
you learn to accept all kinds of surprises. Right. But, um,

154
00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:29.240
I think that we were very sure not to judge, you know, my father,

155
00:09:29.241 --> 00:09:31.430
I think my father is entitled to his life.

156
00:09:31.431 --> 00:09:35.960
And I think that we very quickly understood that it's above all. It's, it's sad,

157
00:09:35.961 --> 00:09:39.110
you know, it's, it's very tragic for everybody to lose your father,

158
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:44.000
especially a father that you didn't know as well. Right. So I think that, um,

159
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:48.440
with time you become a lot more accepting of, of choices that your parents make.

160
00:09:48.441 --> 00:09:51.770
But I think for, for us then it was just about, about doing the right thing,

161
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.100
right. About being fair and about, um, you know, moving forward.

162
00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.550
<v 0>Hmm. Do, do you know him? I don't know him that well now,</v>

163
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.880
overall, I mean, you're five siblings then, uh,

164
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.700
which one of them have you been closest to?

165
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:14.480
<v 1>It's all, I mean, you, the four of us grew up in, in one, in one household,</v>

166
00:10:14.481 --> 00:10:18.170
one family, um, and that if you have siblings knows,

167
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.400
it comes with its challenges and it's fun. Um, and, but my,

168
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.950
my youngest brother max, um,

169
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.340
I was close to cause he was involved as well in the business and he was very

170
00:10:28.341 --> 00:10:31.640
much a big supporter of, of mine and of what we were trying to build.

171
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.200
<v 0>So, so w was the plan that, I mean, he passed away last year. Yes, he did.</v>

172
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.390
What was the plan that he was going to be a part of the business in the future

173
00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:44.030
as well? Yeah. What kind of part did he play?

174
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.290
<v 1>Well, I think from the very beginning, I think if you think he was only 16,</v>

175
00:10:48.291 --> 00:10:49.460
when his own father died,

176
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.970
I think it started with the expectations and the hope that he would be involved,

177
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.200
even from my father's point of view. Right. And so, um, he was,

178
00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:01.280
he believed very much in, in the ability of technology to change people's lives,

179
00:11:01.281 --> 00:11:03.200
to bring choice and to bring joy,

180
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:07.790
whether it's through e-commerce and selling a pair of jeans or whether it's

181
00:11:07.791 --> 00:11:10.520
through education and healthcare. So he was our customer,

182
00:11:10.521 --> 00:11:13.910
he was the generation with the confidence that he brought to,

183
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.700
to business to really have a, a dialogue with these entrepreneurs that,

184
00:11:17.701 --> 00:11:19.190
that I deal with on a daily basis,

185
00:11:19.191 --> 00:11:23.420
he was the perfect balance to my rather strict approach, to,

186
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.010
to try and to build value.

187
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.930
<v 0>He became sick at a young age and, and this was, this was a surprise for you,</v>

188
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.390
wasn't it? I thought he was started.

189
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.800
<v 1>Diabetes and, um, I think type one diabetes, and it gets very serious,</v>

190
00:11:36.801 --> 00:11:39.950
which is why I'm quite involved in other things for children. Um,

191
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.280
both here at home in Sweden, as well as, as well as abroad, but, you know,

192
00:11:43.281 --> 00:11:46.460
diabetes is increasingly becoming, um, you know, a big problem,

193
00:11:46.461 --> 00:11:49.610
especially for young people who, who don't know how to treat it. So.

194
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:57.070
<v 0>The thing is that through these years that you've been the chairman,</v>

195
00:11:57.071 --> 00:12:00.250
you have multiplied the value of the company. Um,

196
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.330
and then, so then I wonder,

197
00:12:04.331 --> 00:12:08.800
why did you choose to step down because you, this earlier this year,

198
00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:10.930
you announced that you will set down as a chairman.

199
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:15.160
You look like a disappointed shareholder, Frederick. How,

200
00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:19.330
how disappointed were they? I'm not a shareholder. You looked all of us.

201
00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.290
<v 1>Suddenly like a little disappointed. No. Um, I, uh,</v>

202
00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.200
I think all things have it's it's time, right?

203
00:12:25.201 --> 00:12:29.850
So I think when you're doing something from 24 years old to 39 years old,

204
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:33.660
um, I had, uh, uh, end of last year where I sat down and said, you know,

205
00:12:33.661 --> 00:12:37.860
before I'm 40, um, I don't want to be carried out, uh, from the boardroom,

206
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:38.791
I'm an entrepreneur.

207
00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:43.290
I want to go back to finding people who can bring ideas and energy to,

208
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:45.780
to what I believe in. So I stepped back from the formal role,

209
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.153
allowed a great person to do.

210
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:51.810
<v 0>For me. Were there other reasons as well? Well,</v>

211
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.840
what are you, what are you getting? Well, I'm getting, I guess,

212
00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.060
one thing that surprised me a lot,

213
00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:01.380
that this is funny because when I met you before, well, the thing is that I.

214
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.840
<v 1>Like to surprise you sometimes too. Yeah.</v>

215
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:09.750
<v 0>But well you did. And in they come, no, I'm just bringing the fart back.</v>

216
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.260
But the thing is that the thing is that, that when I,

217
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:23.760
when I met you before this interview yep. For our cow, for our little fecal.

218
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:27.900
Yes. You, you had a very young baby yes. With,

219
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.620
with you a little five week old. Yes. A five week.

220
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.680
You did very well holding him. Thank you very much. I'm,

221
00:13:33.681 --> 00:13:37.210
I'm quite as experienced actually. And with that. Uh, but,

222
00:13:37.211 --> 00:13:41.850
but the thing is, I didn't know, nobody knew, and this is your first son,

223
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:46.110
your fourth kid, but your first child. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and it's, uh,

224
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:50.590
it's really, uh, it was a secret in a way, but it then obviously.

225
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.830
<v 1>No, I think if, you know,</v>

226
00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:55.110
if you're a shareholder and you see me in may and July, I mean,

227
00:13:55.111 --> 00:13:58.020
there's a natural development around having a trial that becomes quite,

228
00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:03.000
quite obvious. I think people are just polite maybe, but, um, no, the idea that,

229
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:07.290
yeah, just to, to prioritize some time for, for me, for my family,

230
00:14:07.291 --> 00:14:10.650
I've got four kids under 10 years old. Yeah. So I think anyone who has,

231
00:14:10.651 --> 00:14:13.890
has that knows that they have different demands and different, you know,

232
00:14:13.891 --> 00:14:15.840
ways to spend your time. So that was part of it.

233
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:20.600
But then I think equally it was part of redefining my role. I mean, going to,

234
00:14:20.601 --> 00:14:23.460
to try to do something different where I can add value in different ways.

235
00:14:23.461 --> 00:14:26.220
I mean, Sydney, at the end of that board table, looking at a,

236
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.720
an oil painting of your grandfather and an oil painting of your father, you,

237
00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.280
you might lose sight of what you're trying to do,

238
00:14:32.281 --> 00:14:34.350
which is to go build exciting companies.

239
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.450
<v 0>Do, do you still just sort of regarded as a family company?</v>

240
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.590
Absolutely. But do you, I mean,

241
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:48.030
now that you have your own family yes. Uh, um, eh, quite many,

242
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.760
you are quite many. I mean, no.

243
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.110
<v 1>Plus we pulled up in the parking lot.</v>

244
00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:59.260
<v 0>Four children. That's, that's, that's a, that's a bunch more than average. Uh,</v>

245
00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:01.450
I mean, do you, um.

246
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:03.250
<v 1>Do.</v>

247
00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:07.360
<v 0>You also want to live a different life than you had as a, as a chairman?</v>

248
00:15:07.361 --> 00:15:09.340
Do you want to have, do you want to lead a different life?

249
00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:16.270
<v 1>Um, yes, definitely. How Crow, because I think it's,</v>

250
00:15:16.271 --> 00:15:18.650
I think you have the company and you have the,

251
00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:21.160
the business and the legacy responsibility,

252
00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:26.050
but you also want to be free to go and find new

253
00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:30.760
opportunities to, I moved back to Sweden almost exactly a year ago. Um,

254
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:35.470
I want the kids to speak Swedish, to feel Swedish, to walk to school. Um,

255
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.780
so some of the simple things I think become very,

256
00:15:37.781 --> 00:15:40.930
very important after the kind of 14 years that I've had. So yeah.

257
00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.850
<v 0>You moved back to Sweden. Yes. Your husband, Alex. He's still in England.</v>

258
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:47.980
<v 1>And he's here sometimes do he's coming tonight.</v>

259
00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:50.170
<v 0>Okay. So he lives there or.</v>

260
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:54.070
<v 1>His business is abroad, but no, he's, he's back and forth. Yeah.</v>

261
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:55.530
His business is.

262
00:15:55.900 --> 00:16:00.280
<v 0>It's sort of a event company, is it? Yes. Yes. And it's very big.</v>

263
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.750
<v 1>I don't buy it's it's he's he does very well. He works very, very hard.</v>

264
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.600
It didn't he creates, uh, events.

265
00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:12.070
<v 0>Yeah. Th th th I think, eh, the Royal wedding, right.</v>

266
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.930
He did which the one with Kate.

267
00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:16.083
<v 1>But if you don't</v>

268
00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.430
[inaudible] up the street. No, he doesn't. He's a great business.

269
00:16:24.431 --> 00:16:29.260
He's a great entrepreneur. So yes, he is an event organizer all over the place.

270
00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:34.600
<v 0>Who is, is he in your life? I mean, not just the event organizer. Right.</v>

271
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:39.820
<v 1>Well, that meant the know that too. Yeah, he does organized, I must say no, but,</v>

272
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.870
um, he's, he's been a very important part of, of, of course who I've become and,

273
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:47.980
and the choices that we make together for our family. So, yeah. He's great.

274
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:51.580
<v 0>So is it involved? I mean, you, you, you, you discuss things.</v>

275
00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.550
<v 1>Oh, was he? Yes. But I think I also,</v>

276
00:16:57.551 --> 00:17:02.140
might've tried to get him to think it was his idea a few years, but in the end,

277
00:17:02.141 --> 00:17:06.790
when we decided to go [inaudible].

278
00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:11.140
<v 0>How do you prepare your kids for one day they might take over,</v>

279
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:12.040
how can you prepare them?

280
00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:14.260
<v 1>They, um.</v>

281
00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:16.580
<v 0>They might be in your situation. I mean, you know.</v>

282
00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:17.910
<v 1>Yeah. I think I'll, I'll,</v>

283
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:21.760
I'll make sure things are a little bit more orderly if I,

284
00:17:21.761 --> 00:17:26.310
if I can choose a little bit fewer, fewer startup companies, uh, to,

285
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.990
to step into. But no, I think this part of being in Sweden,

286
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:32.890
part of being in Sweden is, is to, to, to show them that, you know, you're,

287
00:17:32.891 --> 00:17:34.420
you're a part of this, this family,

288
00:17:34.421 --> 00:17:37.780
and you're part of this business and you're part of this community that does

289
00:17:37.781 --> 00:17:38.590
interesting things.

290
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.950
So I have one child here today and we'll see what she says about the media

291
00:17:41.951 --> 00:17:42.784
business.

292
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.520
<v 0>Thank you so much for being with us. Thank you.</v>
