WEBVTT

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.270
<v 0>[Inaudible] so, uh, I mean, looking at these pictures,</v>

2
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.160
especially one picture that I found before, before when I knew we should beat.

3
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.210
Um, and th this is, this is a, this is a bit look at that.

4
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.100
It's like you're flying. Yeah. Yeah. My first thought was

5
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.100
don't you ever hurt yourself?

6
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.940
<v 1>Um, yes, actually, um, a year ago I ruptured my Achilles tendon.</v>

7
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.250
Uh three-quarters of it. Um, it's quite a story. Um, I was in Italy, Sicily,

8
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.240
and I met Lenny Kravitz and Lenny was like, Oh,

9
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.360
I would like to dedicate this song to McKayla, to Prince. And I was like,

10
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.290
Oh my God, it's Lenny Kravitz. And then, so, um,

11
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.320
I'm a clumsy person as well. So I was like, okay, let me be smart about this.

12
00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:57.050
I'm going to take my heels off and go and sit next to him on stage.

13
00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.990
And so I sit like, uh, at the bench underneath the stage,

14
00:00:59.991 --> 00:01:03.650
I'm just looking at him like, Oh, I love you so much. And then, um,

15
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.700
I get off the seat and then I, uh, like fall into a big dip.

16
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.870
Cause it was at a old temple and old temples are unfortunately uneven.

17
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.250
And I knew right away. I was like, Oh, I ruptured my Achilles.

18
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.350
I went to my agent. I said, I have to go to the hospital.

19
00:01:18.351 --> 00:01:20.060
I ruptured my Achilles.

20
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.410
<v 0>Doing that. You did it.</v>

21
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.710
<v 1>I know. I know. I know. And.</v>

22
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.060
<v 0>Exactly. Yeah. Um, and you were child number 27?</v>

23
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.490
<v 1>Uh, no pick ILO. Yeah. Child number 27.</v>

24
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.830
Well, I was number 27 and my original name is Ms. Vinci.

25
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.750
And the thing is I had be Lego.

26
00:01:44.751 --> 00:01:48.350
I was born with the skin condition and in West Africa they thought because of my

27
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.300
gender, which is the white it's the white spots. Yeah.

28
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.290
It was more pronounced when I was younger because I was very malnourished. Um,

29
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.140
after losing both my parents, my uncle brought me to the orphanage.

30
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.380
The orphanage they ranked us from one is a favorite child.

31
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.740
Number 27 is the least favorite. And because of my spots,

32
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.440
they called me the devil child, the devil child. Yeah.

33
00:02:06.441 --> 00:02:07.790
They thought anything that happened,

34
00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:11.300
anything that was wrong was my fault that I caused it to happen. If it was,

35
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.690
if you didn't get enough crops, if you, if the rain didn't come that year,

36
00:02:14.691 --> 00:02:19.250
if it was my fault, because it was very spiritual. And you would think that,

37
00:02:19.251 --> 00:02:21.500
you know, all these children we've lost our families.

38
00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:26.120
You would think these women that were taking care of us would show us love and

39
00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:29.060
nurture us and care for us. But instead they just treat,

40
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.710
it treated me like the devil shop.

41
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.810
And then my best friend who was number 26 because she was left-handed and she

42
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:37.040
didn't choose to be born. Left-handed.

43
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.400
<v 0>Being ranked so low. Uh, what, what,</v>

44
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.880
what did that lead to, I mean, did you.

45
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.440
<v 1>Did you have to, did you get the same food as the elders or did you know?</v>

46
00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:52.040
I got smaller portion of food. I got the last choice of the clothing pile.

47
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.640
I was, yeah. They, I remember they told me who would want,

48
00:02:55.641 --> 00:02:58.220
who adopted the devil's child? I wasn't going to get adopted,

49
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.820
but luckily enough, because my best friend had the exact same name. My mom,

50
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:06.580
my mom now she was looking online and she said,

51
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:09.130
and she called the agency and she said, Oh, I'd like to adopt them venti.

52
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:13.450
And they said, well, which one? Lindsey, duh, duh. But, um,

53
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.900
and so then they, my mom realized there's another Mabenti. They were like, yeah,

54
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:20.410
we have to. And they explained that nobody wanted me because of my spots.

55
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.710
They didn't, they thought, you know, to have issues and insecurity.

56
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:26.170
So they didn't want to deal with that. But then my mom was like,

57
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.580
I will take her. Okay.

58
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.200
<v 2>She's American.</v>

59
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.720
<v 0>When did you first discover ballet?</v>

60
00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:41.060
Because in wa war-torn in Sierra Layola there wasn't much ballet wasn't there?

61
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.430
<v 1>No ballet all, I mean, of course it's a, it's a very cultural,</v>

62
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.980
it's a lot of music, a lot of dancing, different things,

63
00:03:46.981 --> 00:03:48.660
but I never saw ballet before.

64
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.170
And so this magazine I found in Sierra Leone,

65
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.570
it was 10 years after this magazine was published.

66
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.050
And on the cover was a ballerina. Her name is Maggie MESAC.

67
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.370
It took us maybe 12 to 15 years to find out who she was.

68
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.030
But I saw, I saw this person, but it could have been a tennis player.

69
00:04:06.031 --> 00:04:07.130
It could have been anybody.

70
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.700
Was she looked happy and as the child in the orphanage and the orphanage. Yeah.

71
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.630
And I was four years old. And so in this time it wasn't the two, two,

72
00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:19.050
it wasn't this. I mean, it was cool. Like, she was very pretty,

73
00:04:19.051 --> 00:04:22.830
but she looks so happy and I wanted to know what that felt like. So I thought,

74
00:04:22.831 --> 00:04:25.710
okay, I'm going to be exactly like her in this way. I would be happy to.

75
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.530
And do you keep that with you? Yeah,

76
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.060
I ripped the cover off and it's pretty gross, but, um, I put it in my underwear.

77
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.930
Um, cause I was the only place I could put it. And when I got adopted,

78
00:04:36.931 --> 00:04:39.600
I tried to explain to my mom why my adopted mom,

79
00:04:39.601 --> 00:04:42.120
why I was looking through her luggage. So I assumed, okay,

80
00:04:42.121 --> 00:04:45.720
American mothers are going to have everything, right. You're 22, your Tiara,

81
00:04:45.721 --> 00:04:49.620
your point shoes is it's automatic. But so it was looking through everything.

82
00:04:49.621 --> 00:04:51.060
And then the only way I could explain to her,

83
00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:53.430
what I was looking for was show her that picture,

84
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.510
the most precious thing that I had just to give it to her. And she understood.

85
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.463
Right.

86
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.460
<v 0>Wow. So then she wanted to help you. Yeah. And she coming would dance.</v>

87
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.110
Uh, but before that, I mean, you,

88
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.900
you grew up in a very different part of the world and you come with your

89
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.790
now sister. Um, and you, you, you, you come to,

90
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.950
to us. W w can you remember your first impression?

91
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.380
Can you remember that? W what, what that was like.

92
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.120
<v 1>I mean, going to the grocery store for the first time was in credible,</v>

93
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.800
I had never seen that was my,

94
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.370
I think my favorite part was the fact that in the orphanage,

95
00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:36.204
we didn't have food.

96
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.200
We didn't have a lot of food in the food that we got was not very good at all.

97
00:05:40.201 --> 00:05:43.470
It was mostly rice or beans, but when I went to Subaru,

98
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.590
my favorite thing that I grabbed, the first thing was grapes.

99
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.480
I had never tasted anything like that. It was absolutely amazing. And also,

100
00:05:51.481 --> 00:05:53.130
I didn't know that you had to pay for it. So I just was like.

101
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.010
<v 2>But, um, yeah, it was, it was a, of a shock. And.</v>

102
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.200
<v 1>Then also, um, like my family were quite big.</v>

103
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:02.660
There are nine of us adopted six from West Africa,

104
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.150
two from the Philippines and one from the States.

105
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:07.940
And the reason why we got adopted is because Michael,

106
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.900
my three of my brothers had HIV and AIDS. And so Michael, before he passed away,

107
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:16.100
he begged my parents to adopt a child from West Africa. So in his honor,

108
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:20.690
that's what they did. But, uh, to go into a place where, yeah,

109
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.780
Mikayla, Mia, Mario were all M's. Um,

110
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:28.080
but to go into a place where all of a sudden, everybody loves you. You're,

111
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.730
you're wondering why, but I, I, I thought I was this monster.

112
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:33.860
Why would you think, why would you love me?

113
00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:38.630
Because I look hor I thought I looked like a monster because of what they

114
00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:43.490
told me, but it was amazing the amount of love and it was,

115
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.470
and the, the things that my mom would make us the amount of food that, yeah.

116
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.550
I felt like.

117
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.160
<v 0>Were you able to receive that kind of love from the start? Or was it difficult,</v>

118
00:06:54.161 --> 00:06:55.360
a difficult transition for you?

119
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.330
<v 1>It was very difficult. It took me some time, because as a child,</v>

120
00:06:58.331 --> 00:07:01.090
because of the PTSD, I thought I was still in Sierra Leone.

121
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:05.220
So every single time I'd go to bed, I would be scared to wake up and be back.

122
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.520
<v 0>On you. You've, you've experienced some terrible things. Seen a lot of.</v>

123
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.470
<v 1>Yeah. And so I would be so scared to fall asleep. And, um,</v>

124
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.550
and when I would fall asleep,

125
00:07:15.551 --> 00:07:19.030
I'd relive the nightmares that I had in Sierra Leone constantly every single

126
00:07:19.031 --> 00:07:19.720
night.

127
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.040
And it took me a few years to finally believe I was in the States that I wasn't

128
00:07:24.041 --> 00:07:27.400
gonna wake up and be back in the orphanage. Can you still have nightmares? Yeah.

129
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.590
Um, I was diagnosed officially almost two years ago with BTFC, uh,

130
00:07:32.591 --> 00:07:35.260
to the point where I was so dissociated with, um,

131
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.860
what I was doing that I just was on autopilot. Wasn't sleeping at night.

132
00:07:38.861 --> 00:07:43.840
I was terrified. Um, I was very hypersensitive, but I went to S uh,

133
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.710
to a therapist and started EMDR, which is, um, rapid eye movement.

134
00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:51.190
And it is incredible. It's not just that. I just, I, I, I,

135
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.040
I went to a therapist. I talked about my problems.

136
00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:55.630
I didn't pretend that I didn't have this issue.

137
00:07:55.631 --> 00:07:59.410
I finally gave myself a chance to, to heal. And that was, uh,

138
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.830
the biggest achievement I think I've accomplished. So that's helped. Yeah,

139
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:03.693
definitely.

140
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.980
<v 0>Um, becoming a dancer,</v>

141
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.630
ballet, a soloist, uh, as you are,

142
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:18.610
it's not an easy way. I mean, even though you have the support from,

143
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:23.500
from home, it's a very, this is a very white art form.

144
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.910
Yeah. Unfortunately, and I know you made a point of that. Um,

145
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:32.470
uh, in what way has that been difficult for you?

146
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:38.200
<v 1>Well, the thing is when you see somebody on TV and they look like you,</v>

147
00:08:38.201 --> 00:08:41.380
you think you can accomplish something. I didn't see that.

148
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.410
So I was very worried and I did have a few people,

149
00:08:44.411 --> 00:08:48.130
like there is Heidi Cruz from Pennsylvania ballet who was very supportive.

150
00:08:48.131 --> 00:08:51.940
And especially when, um, I was getting ready to do this role, I was so excited.

151
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.920
Everybody knows a Nutcracker, right? Yeah. And I was getting ready to do Maria.

152
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:58.980
I was rehearsing and rehearsing. And then I overheard my teacher saying, Oh,

153
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.770
she's not going to do, because America's already for black Marie.

154
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:07.470
I was a little child. I was so excited to achieve this, um, yeah.

155
00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.020
To be the lead in the Nutcracker. And this is when I started to realize, Oh,

156
00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:12.930
this is going to be so hard. And of course, sometimes I was like, okay,

157
00:09:12.931 --> 00:09:13.950
this is just not worth it.

158
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:18.240
I there's nobody else out there like me there's there was like maybe five,

159
00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:21.720
five principle dancers that I knew that were African-American.

160
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.220
And then I saw everybody else and I was like, okay, is this really worth it?

161
00:09:26.221 --> 00:09:30.930
Is it really worth feeling like I don't belong all the time that I have to

162
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:34.290
not eat because I need to be just as skinny as those other girls that, you know,

163
00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:37.500
I was constantly discriminated against because of the fact that I was a certain

164
00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:41.970
color. And it wasn't just that in ballet, it was also my outside life as well.

165
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.030
So when I went to go and do something that I love so much,

166
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:49.290
I was discriminated against because of it. It was. Yeah. But also,

167
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:52.950
I like to prove people wrong, so try to prove them wrong.

168
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:01.170
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

169
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.860
<v 1>Are you, um, at, at this time,</v>

170
00:10:03.861 --> 00:10:07.280
when you overheard them saying that you couldn't do the lead part in the

171
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.380
Nutcracker. Yeah. And it's, and that was just the beginning.

172
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.113
That was.

173
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.000
<v 0>Yeah. I do have support from the government or.</v>

174
00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.850
<v 1>My parents. And it's a, the arts is such a beautiful thing.</v>

175
00:10:22.851 --> 00:10:27.590
It's so historical that, and it's so expensive to do something so incredible.

176
00:10:27.591 --> 00:10:31.910
And to, to, especially for children like me, my family, the arts has helped,

177
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.420
like it has saved us. It has helped us find a way to express ourselves.

178
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.050
My sisters are singers, um, uh, pianos, uh,

179
00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.650
she can play the oboe art. If we didn't have that,

180
00:10:42.651 --> 00:10:47.480
I don't know how we would be or who we would be right now. Do you,

181
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:52.010
do you feel like you've passed the point of being, um,

182
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:56.990
the black ballet dancer and just become this super amazing

183
00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.670
ballet dancer? Is that even something you're striving for it?

184
00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.880
Yes. I'm because the thing is, I talk about,

185
00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.390
I'm like saying I'm a black ballet dancer, ballerina. You don't doctor,

186
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:11.090
doesn't say I'm a black doctor pilot. Yeah.

187
00:11:11.091 --> 00:11:14.180
And you have to constantly have to say this because there aren't black

188
00:11:14.181 --> 00:11:16.400
ballerinas and these children, like they're saying, Oh,

189
00:11:16.401 --> 00:11:18.230
we want to make the companies more diverse.

190
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.440
But if you're discriminating children who are different. Yeah.

191
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.600
How are you going to make anything different within the company.

192
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.240
<v 0>Even, even the clothes for a ballerina made for.</v>

193
00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.030
<v 1>Yes, exactly. But now I just helped, um, a brand called Gaynor.</v>

194
00:11:32.031 --> 00:11:34.700
Minden is a point shoe brand, also freed London as well,

195
00:11:34.701 --> 00:11:38.330
came out with Brown point shoes. So in 2017,

196
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.520
gainer Midian came out with the very first pair of Brown point shoes.

197
00:11:40.521 --> 00:11:44.180
I now wear Brown point shoes on stage and Brown tights as well.

198
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.720
And I feel like myself, I, it's not two different people.

199
00:11:47.721 --> 00:11:51.170
I just always felt like, like I couldn't stand. Like,

200
00:11:51.171 --> 00:11:54.370
I couldn't be proud of dancing on stage. I couldn't,

201
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.720
I wasn't a hundred percent there.

202
00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:01.440
<v 0>You've you've, uh, you've also done, uh, performed in a video by Beyonce.</v>

203
00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:03.630
So that was pretty cool too. That's very cool.

204
00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.240
[inaudible] so I guess that was nice.

205
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.850
And also Madonna is going to do a film about.

206
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.600
<v 1>Yeah. She's directing my life story my little life, but yeah, my life.</v>

207
00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:20.820
<v 0>Um, I would say,</v>

208
00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:24.660
first of all, I would say lucky her, uh, project,

209
00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.110
but where are you a fan? Where are you a Madonna fan?

210
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:32.460
<v 1>I mean, yeah. I've had, uh, not to put this in a way,</v>

211
00:12:32.461 --> 00:12:35.970
but I have a lot of gay friends and that's why I knew about Madonna and her

212
00:12:35.971 --> 00:12:38.850
music. And, but when I met Madonna, it wasn't,

213
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:43.830
she is so incredible. And so like, she does her,

214
00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.620
she does it her way. And that inspired me to do my way,

215
00:12:46.621 --> 00:12:50.910
the way I want to do it the way. Yeah. Not the way everybody else is doing.

216
00:12:50.911 --> 00:12:54.510
I want to be able to leave a Mark. And that is what she's doing. And she's so,

217
00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:58.590
I mean, she is so intelligent and just so like, yeah,

218
00:12:58.591 --> 00:13:01.260
she doesn't take from anybody.

219
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.610
<v 3>But I believe this is survey. That could be a successful,</v>

220
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.120
they took all your own way and follow not a data.

221
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:13.350
If a father other this value, we talk about Norway. [inaudible].

222
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:19.380
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

223
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.820
<v 3>No, no, no, no. But I say to the suites, I come 95 there. And I say,</v>

224
00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.960
if you follow Norway, we never beat SIM. We are always number two. And this,

225
00:13:27.961 --> 00:13:32.760
I think it's in every single follow your dreams. Exactly what you're like.

226
00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:37.680
It doesn't matter what it's a good carpenter has also a good life also.

227
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:42.210
And this is what I prefer for my life

228
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:47.060
that I live in a three. And you live in a treatment, you live in a treatment,

229
00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.440
you live in a dream, you have to harvest life from us,

230
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.750
but the people fight the cancer, your path.

231
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:56.640
This is I think the secret of a good life doing it your way.

232
00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.690
It doesn't matter how successful, but do you have to follow?

233
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:01.983
This is what your life.

234
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:05.640
<v 0>I think, uh, with those words, uh,</v>

235
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:09.720
I think we should let you take the stage because your band is waiting for you.

236
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.210
Oh yes. Thank you so much. Thank you.

237

Thank you so much for sharing your story here before you do it with Madonna.

239
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.580
I really appreciate that. And, uh, and good luck with everything.

240
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:33.450
