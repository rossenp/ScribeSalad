00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.850
<v 0>Some pictures of your dad there, Stephen Hawking.</v>

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.550
He died this year in March.

3
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.580
<v 1>He did. He died on the 14th of March,</v>

4
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.130
which is actually the birthday of Albert Einstein,

5
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.990
which is quite remarkable because he was born on the anniversary of the death of

6
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.710
Galileo, Galileo, Galileo, the great Italian astronomer.

7
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.740
And he died on the birthday of Albert Einstein.

8
00:00:24.741 --> 00:00:28.100
And it was like this final flourish. Um,

9
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.520
it was just another extraordinary,

10
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.190
another extraordinary fact about him.

11
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.103
<v 0>He, he, he got,</v>

12
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.970
he got to live more than 50 years more than the

13
00:00:40.971 --> 00:00:41.870
doctors predicted.

14
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.951
<v 1>That's right.</v>

15
00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:47.450
He was given an early and devastating prognosis around age

16
00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:51.050
20. He was told that he would only live for a couple of years,

17
00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:55.160
that he had motor neuron disease and that effectively his life was over.

18
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.210
And I think he was, he was understandably extremely depressed and very saddened,

19
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.330
but then he sort of pulled themselves together. He met my mother,

20
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.460
they fell in love. They decided to get married.

21
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.500
He happened upon an idea for his PhD thesis and he obviously

22
00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:12.710
decided like, right, I'm going to do this whatever time I have left,

23
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.420
I'm going to make the most of it.

24
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.540
And of course he didn't know at that time it was going to be 50 years.

25
00:01:17.541 --> 00:01:19.190
We didn't know none of us knew.

26
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.840
And yet he carried on making the most of every single day that he had.

27
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.790
<v 0>Let's start with. And tell me, tell me about that day when he passed away.</v>

28
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.450
<v 1>That's a very sad day. Um,</v>

29
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.850
I actually had been living with my father since Christmas because I

30
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.080
wouldn't stay with him for Christmas.

31
00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:42.050
And I was really only intending to stay for a few days. Um,

32
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.120
but I actually ended up moving in with him.

33
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.910
And so I lived with him until the end,

34
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.830
but I wasn't actually there I'd gone home for 24 hours and I was sort of really

35
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.230
devastated by that. I thought, but I wasn't there,

36
00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:58.190
but this is a very common experience. A lot of people who've told me since then,

37
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.960
but very often, um, people can't let go when somebody they love is there.

38
00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:07.820
They actually wait for that person to leave the room or go somewhere else. Um,

39
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.290
for, they feel they can slip away.

40
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.260
So I got a call very early in the morning to say

41
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.830
your father has died.

42
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.680
And that was just a very

43
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.470
impactful memory that I, I,

44
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.000
I will remember for forever that phone call the phone ringing,

45
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.090
picking it up, hearing those words, and then

46
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.460
getting out of bed, realizing there were things, you know, that,

47
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.570
that there's this shock being shocked and stunned, but still sort of realizing,

48
00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:44.510
well, there are things I have to do. Um,

49
00:02:44.511 --> 00:02:49.040
and I ended up calling a new birth to take me to Cambridge because I was sort of

50
00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:53.960
discombobulated I'm in the wrong place. And the irony was all that time.

51
00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:56.870
I remember with my father, I had been nipping home, you know,

52
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.240
I'd been popping home to sort of tidy up a post,

53
00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.660
do whatever you do and empty the fridge. Um,

54
00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.070
and I'd always packed my case. As soon as I got home,

55
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.740
I would unpack my case and repack it immediately,

56
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:11.290
so that I'd be ready to go if I needed to go straight back.

57
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.500
And that was the one time I hadn't. So I sort of blundered around,

58
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:17.350
pulling things out of drawers and shoving them on the front called, well,

59
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:20.710
I don't know what to do. And then got in a taxi and went.

60
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.770
<v 0>Do you remember your last conversation?</v>

61
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.450
<v 1>I have a very vivid memory of the last time.</v>

62
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:33.160
I feel that I actually spoke to my dad when he was still sitting up in his chair

63
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:38.140
before he became bedridden. And that, yeah, that was,

64
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.810
it's very strange to think back now because in some ways it feels like it was an

65
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:45.910
eternity ago. And in other times it just,

66
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.950
it feels like it almost hasn't happened because he's so omnipresent in a way,

67
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.670
you know, I still hear his voice. I still, we see pictures of him.

68
00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:58.180
He is sort of with us, even though he's not.

69
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:01.270
So in a way it's not like he's gone.

70
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.960
I don't know whether that's a thing about grief of bereavement,

71
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.730
whether other people experience that,

72
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.530
but you have this feeling of presence like that, that person is still there.

73
00:04:11.531 --> 00:04:14.140
And of course he'd be furious with me for saying that because that,

74
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:14.974
wasn't what he believed.

75
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.760
<v 2>The tool. Sorry.</v>

76
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.830
<v 0>But did you talk about small things or big things or.</v>

77
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.580
<v 1>I mean, I think we were more normal than people ever gave us credit for.</v>

78
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.773
<v 2>So.</v>

79
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.160
<v 1>Conversations about the first three minutes after the big bang.</v>

80
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.400
And then we talk about whether to get a Curry for taker, a takeaway,

81
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.570
go for dinner. I think people really got us at all ever.

82
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.510
<v 0>I, I, I mean him,</v>

83
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.520
him dying is it's it's, um, it's a shock for you, but it's,

84
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.590
uh, it's always as with people of, of his, uh, um,

85
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.160
what should I say magnitude it's it's, it's a worldliness as well.

86
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.030
<v 1>That was one of the astonishing things was how quickly, how far, how,</v>

87
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.330
how report and, and there's, there's this sort of extraordinary,

88
00:05:06.331 --> 00:05:09.180
just this outpouring of affection that came from everywhere,

89
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.440
all around the world.

90
00:05:10.441 --> 00:05:13.890
Suddenly we were being sent emails and messages and people were, uh,

91
00:05:13.891 --> 00:05:17.260
WhatsApping me, uh, sort of cartoons that had come out in, in,

92
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.920
in the newspaper in South Africa that day featuring him.

93
00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:22.170
And they were also beautiful, you know,

94
00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:26.670
they were so sweet and they were so funny and so sad and so

95
00:05:26.671 --> 00:05:30.270
poignant. And like, I think, um, that, that tweet from Barack Obama, you know,

96
00:05:30.271 --> 00:05:32.760
I hope you're having fun up there among the stars, you know,

97
00:05:32.761 --> 00:05:36.360
that still brings a tear to my eye every time I think about it.

98
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.850
So that I think was just extraordinary.

99
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.930
<v 0>Tell me about the funeral. That was, that was, that was not a small funeral.</v>

100
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.060
<v 1>No, I'd never organized a funeral before.</v>

101
00:05:45.061 --> 00:05:47.820
And I just had this overriding impression that this really wasn't the one to

102
00:05:47.821 --> 00:05:48.654
start with.

103
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.910
<v 2>It was quite.</v>

104
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.110
<v 1>A big deal. And I did think, Oh, I hope I haven't got this wrong. Um,</v>

105
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.990
and that was tough because we knew that he had a lot of friends,

106
00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:02.330
had a little bit, he had 37 first cousins.

107
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:06.560
He's part of a massive family who all obviously wanted to come and then bring

108
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:07.640
partners. And so,

109
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.120
and then all his colleagues and his friends and people from Cambridge. Um,

110
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.220
so just people wanted to come.

111
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.600
So I knew that the church would be full and we just still needed to hold it in,

112
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.660
um, the university church, because that's where academics,

113
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:23.660
distinguished academics at Cambridge university have their funerals.

114
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.650
My father was, he liked a bit of Palm print tradition. Oh, Oh,

115
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:33.500
Oh my goodness. Are you kidding? I mean, if we'd have had some sort of,

116
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.610
I don't know, some kind of nondescript panel room, thank you to be livid.

117
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.490
I mean, really,

118
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.780
I went through all that and you can't even give me a proper sendoff.

119
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.050
So I did feel that it was beholden on us to do it properly and to do it in,

120
00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.530
in that way. And we had the most, somebody said to me afterwards,

121
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:58.040
they said that funeral was a template for somebody who wants a religious service

122
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:02.180
that is not even remotely religious. The reading was from Plato.

123
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.320
The Bible reading was read by Eddie Redmayne. Uh,

124
00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:07.880
I think you have to have the Lord's prayer in a church service,

125
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.450
but we had it song and old church Slavonic. And I was like, yeah, no,

126
00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:15.200
one's gonna realize so, and, and the,

127
00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:18.470
the address was brilliantly given by the Dean of my father's college.

128
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.180
And she just really managed to talk about him, context of Plato,

129
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.300
of great discovery of inspiring humanity. Um, and,

130
00:07:28.301 --> 00:07:31.910
and a lot of people left feeling very inspired and it was all quite solemn.

131
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.180
You know, we had lots of solar music and then right at the very end,

132
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.840
only the musical director, and I knew this was going to happen.

133
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:44.150
So the strains of ALGOL sorry, host, drifted away.

134
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.440
And then somebody started playing, fly me to the moon on the piano, you know,

135
00:07:48.441 --> 00:07:50.090
the Frank Sinatra thing.

136
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.080
And he just started off very quietly and it got bigger and bigger until he was

137
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:57.350
doing full, kind of like this along the piano. And it just left.

138
00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.480
Everyone said that was so him,

139
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.180
it was like that final kind of leave you with a smile.

140
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:14.740
<v 0>[Inaudible] you grew up with him. Uh, and he was your dad.</v>

141
00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:19.180
And yet he was not the normal dad. He was a different dad.

142
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.620
Uh, when did you realize that he wasn't like all the dads?

143
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.980
<v 1>Um, I remember being at primary school and drawing a picture of my parents.</v>

144
00:08:26.981 --> 00:08:28.300
You know, my family, as you do,

145
00:08:28.301 --> 00:08:31.120
and everyone else was drawing pictures of their family. And I was like, okay,

146
00:08:31.121 --> 00:08:34.390
that's my family. And I drew my down, sitting down. Right.

147
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.300
And everyone else had drawn that out, standing up. I remember going, Hmm,

148
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.330
that's funny. Why is my dad sitting down? And your dad is startling because,

149
00:08:40.331 --> 00:08:41.980
you know, children draw those stick figures.

150
00:08:41.981 --> 00:08:44.980
And so I had my mom and then I had my brother and then there was that,

151
00:08:44.981 --> 00:08:48.460
and he was sitting down and he had this kind of blue square behind his head.

152
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.550
And one of my friends said, why is he got a blue square behind his head?

153
00:08:51.551 --> 00:08:54.760
But of course it represented the wheelchair. And I just remember thinking, Oh,

154
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.970
that's kinda different. Um,

155
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:01.230
we had quite a sort of unusual household. Um,

156
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.490
one of my jobs was to answer the phone and that was really exciting, um,

157
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.200
because we were listed in the phone book.

158
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.140
And so I pick up the phone and someone would go,

159
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:13.500
I must speak to Stephen Hawking. And I'd be like, well, I'm sorry,

160
00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:17.640
but he's in the, if I don't speak to him in the next 10 minutes,

161
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:19.080
the universe is going to explode.

162
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.160
<v 2>Well, there we go.</v>

163
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:24.501
<v 1>I have a sort of,</v>

164
00:09:24.501 --> 00:09:28.190
I developed kind of a friendship with this man who would ring up and say he was

165
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:29.720
always at Newton from Japan.

166
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:31.970
<v 2>I.</v>

167
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.130
<v 1>Was quite young. I was probably like about eight years old. And I would think,</v>

168
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.730
you know, I really think if you were Isaac Newton,

169
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.730
you'd understand the time difference between Tokyo and London,

170
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.860
because you call it really stupid hours.

171
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.150
And then he stopped calling. And I've worried about him ever since,

172
00:09:47.151 --> 00:09:48.890
as to what happened to him, who knows.

173
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.610
So all these kinds of strange things happened, which I thought were quite.

174
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:54.590
<v 0>He was a genius.</v>

175
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.070
<v 1>But I didn't see him as that. Excuse my dad. So I was like, yeah,</v>

176
00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.500
you may say that, but you're my dad. And I'm like 16.

177
00:10:00.501 --> 00:10:01.760
So I know way more than you do.

178
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.190
I remember actually saying too much when I was teenager, I was like, seriously,

179
00:10:07.191 --> 00:10:09.290
dad, what would you know? Um,

180
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.850
You have to say it to him now. Come on.

181
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.260
<v 0>I'm glad to hear this because not only normal dads,</v>

182
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.780
he got it too. Yeah, yeah.

183
00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.310
<v 1>That's right. No, none of us think you're cool.</v>

184
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.920
<v 0>Um, he was a, of course, extremely physically challenged. Um,</v>

185
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.270
how did that affect family life and daily life for you?

186
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:42.500
<v 1>Well, I mean,</v>

187
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.770
profound disability is a challenge and for the

188
00:10:48.771 --> 00:10:52.220
person who experiences it and for the people around them.

189
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:56.510
And of course in those days, um, people were really not used to seeing, uh,

190
00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.650
people with a disability out and about it. Wasn't kind of the done thing.

191
00:11:00.651 --> 00:11:04.220
Like if you were disabled, you should be in a wheelchair being pushed,

192
00:11:04.221 --> 00:11:08.660
preferably by a nurse, probably with like a tall rock over your knees. Um,

193
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.440
and you should be sort of suitably grateful to be allowed to be out and about.

194
00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.680
And you shouldn't have any expectations of doing things.

195
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.010
Like my father would like drive his own electric wheelchair at great speed.

196
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:23.480
And then he'd go down the road, like the middle of the road in his wheelchair.

197
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.550
Um, and he wanted to go to restaurants and he'd want to do stuff.

198
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:29.391
You'd want to eat out.

199
00:11:29.391 --> 00:11:32.840
He'd want to go anywhere that non-disabled person would go.

200
00:11:32.841 --> 00:11:36.860
He thought he had a right to go. And so he was kind of a pioneer for that,

201
00:11:36.861 --> 00:11:39.320
because now that's an expectation, you know, you think, well,

202
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.310
why wouldn't you let people go to any place that they want to go?

203
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.550
And now we have laws about access,

204
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.270
but those days you'd get somewhere and there'd be just a flight of stairs and

205
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:54.030
he'd be like, right. What do we do now? And that was tough. And.

206
00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:54.940
<v 0>Of course you have,</v>

207
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.020
you have the people who's there and you have the people's stick,

208
00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.580
tend not to stare. Yeah.

209
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.240
<v 1>The staring people, please don't stare at people.</v>

210
00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.390
<v 0>That is the, that is the key, right?</v>

211
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:10.410
<v 1>It is. It is. Um, I read recently about this,</v>

212
00:12:10.411 --> 00:12:14.130
this fabric that has led lights in, printed in it.

213
00:12:14.131 --> 00:12:16.110
So you can't see that they're there,

214
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.690
but I just thought you could do it so that you had the t-shirt,

215
00:12:18.691 --> 00:12:21.600
if you're wearing it and you'd be with a disabled person and someone,

216
00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:24.300
the staring still goes on, by the way, someone, when they stay,

217
00:12:24.301 --> 00:12:26.610
you could just flick a switch and it would come up in light saying,

218
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.473
stop staring.

219
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:29.700
<v 2>That'd be so cool.</v>

220
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:31.740
<v 1>Really freak people out as well.</v>

221
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:33.870
Cause you could then switch it off and they might think they'd imagined it.

222
00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.530
<v 0>He did. He react to it as much as the rest of, you know, he didn't care.</v>

223
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:41.543
He didn't play it.

224
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.410
<v 1>I mean, sometimes I think when there was a big change in my life.</v>

225
00:12:46.411 --> 00:12:48.180
So when I was growing up,

226
00:12:48.181 --> 00:12:52.680
he wasn't famous in the way we think of him in those later

227
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:56.550
iconic years, um, he was a theoretical physicist.

228
00:12:56.551 --> 00:13:00.270
He was well-known among physicists there. Not that many of them, you know,

229
00:13:00.271 --> 00:13:04.830
so it was really after brief history of time that the whole kind of fame

230
00:13:04.831 --> 00:13:09.540
pressure cookers things happened. Um, and he had ways of dealing with that.

231
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.433
You know, people would go.

232
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.820
<v 2>Oh, look, isn't that, that guy that's that, Oh, you know that.</v>

233
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.391
<v 1>The guy,</v>

234
00:13:15.391 --> 00:13:20.250
the time guy it's like that Stephen Hawkins person and he'd immediately

235
00:13:20.251 --> 00:13:23.580
say on his machine, he'd gone always be mistaken for that, man.

236
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:29.640
<v 2>I'm really confused. We don't, we're not interested now.</v>

237
00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.070
So he is quite kid.

238
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:33.870
<v 1>You know, and, and he had this thing.</v>

239
00:13:33.871 --> 00:13:36.030
If people barged in front of him to get to a lift,

240
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.000
he would have this other instant response that would then go,

241
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.480
I'm so sorry to find that your legs don't work, um,

242
00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:46.770
which really put people in their place and they'd be like, Ooh, oops. Um,

243
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:47.850
so yeah, he was mad.

244
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.980
<v 0>Humor was a great part of it.</v>

245
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.270
<v 1>All of us, you know, we all had to develop a very healthy sense of humor.</v>

246
00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.740
It had to be able to laugh when things got tough because they do, you know,

247
00:13:58.741 --> 00:14:01.080
he was ill a lot. He had motor neuron disease.

248
00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:06.150
It's a devastating condition that is still not very well understood.

249
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.000
<v 0>When, when could you see his frustration, his, his,</v>

250
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:15.330
uh, depression or sadness? Did you ever see that?

251
00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:16.950
<v 1>I don't think he was depressed.</v>

252
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.850
I think he was resolutely robust and upbeat frustrated. Yes.

253
00:14:20.851 --> 00:14:23.820
Because he'd wanted to do stuff and somebody, for reasons,

254
00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:27.210
rightly or wrongly would sometimes say no, uh, no, Steven,

255
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.640
we're not going to take you down in a submarine.

256
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:32.370
<v 2>Steven. We're not feeling.</v>

257
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.320
<v 1>Super confident about this space flight.</v>

258
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.863
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

259
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:40.530
<v 1>So those things didn't get done very well. Um, I mean,</v>

260
00:14:40.531 --> 00:14:41.520
he did say to me and this,

261
00:14:41.521 --> 00:14:45.900
I still find very heartrending towards the end of his life. He said, um,

262
00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:50.070
he felt lonely because he felt people didn't talk to him.

263
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.990
Um, as they would, he would have liked people to talk to him more,

264
00:14:53.991 --> 00:14:58.820
but he thought people were put off by his disability and by his fame and people

265
00:14:58.821 --> 00:15:02.090
used to say to me, I'd in front of myself. I'd, I'd love to talk to your dad,

266
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.620
but I don't know what to say. And I was like, well,

267
00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.550
I would talk to your dad if I met him. So why don't you just talk to my dad?

268
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.710
You know, just say anything, talk about the weather took.

269
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.600
And I did have friends who were brilliant,

270
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:16.550
who just sit down with him and go and, and have like a question go, Stephen,

271
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.600
what's on your bucket list. And then just, and that was so nice.

272
00:15:20.601 --> 00:15:22.130
And I love those friends, but during that.

273
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.800
<v 0>That communication part, because first he could talk. Um,</v>

274
00:15:26.801 --> 00:15:31.000
and then till 1985. Yeah. But it got worse than that. And.

275
00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:36.460
<v 1>Up to 1985, his voice deteriorated, which is a thing in motor neuron disease.</v>

276
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:41.470
Um, it just, the voice gets kind of scratchy and rusty. Um, but his,

277
00:15:41.471 --> 00:15:43.360
his loss of voice was, um,

278
00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:47.380
exacerbated because he had to have a jacket ostomy when he had pneumonia.

279
00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:51.940
And so that means that you do lose the use of your voice box and that's when he

280
00:15:51.941 --> 00:15:54.670
switched to computerized a synthetic voice.

281
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.940
<v 0>And can you still remember his voice?</v>

282
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.670
<v 1>Um, it's funny. I thought I could,</v>

283
00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:03.430
and then I heard it the other day on a documentary. I mean,

284
00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:07.330
and I was quite shocked actually, because I'd sort of forgotten about it,

285
00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:07.930
you know,

286
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:12.610
it's so associated him with that very clear American.

287
00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:17.440
Excellent. And that, that became his voice to me.

288
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:21.820
So it's the box. Yeah, the box. Yeah. My son was so naughty.

289
00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:25.330
My son used to answer the phone and go, hello, this is stupid. Okay.

290
00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.960
But he's very literal. I was like, okay, stop it.

291
00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:35.650
<v 0>Um, is it</v>

292
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.270
perhaps not a fair question, but did he,

293
00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:45.730
did it happen that he could use his limitations

294
00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:48.880
to his advantage, but that was his whole thing.

295
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:53.920
<v 1>Of course it is. Um,</v>

296
00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.770
well he did say to me once work out, you know, what you,

297
00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:01.540
if you have something that you other people think is a disadvantage, you must,

298
00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:05.050
you must make it into your advantage. Um,

299
00:17:05.051 --> 00:17:09.490
so he was quite sort of cheeky, you know, and he obviously thought, well,

300
00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:13.360
I'm in a wheelchair, so I'm going to make the best of it. Um, yeah,

301
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:14.171
I absolutely,

302
00:17:14.171 --> 00:17:18.010
that was his whole thing was to take a limitation and defy it and he took great

303
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.250
ought to transcend it. So he took a lot of pleasure in that. I think.

304
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:27.040
<v 0>It could be also some big because sometimes because of this machine,</v>

305
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.900
he took awhile before he said something. Yes. Was that,

306
00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.070
do you suspect that sometimes was on purpose that he, he,

307
00:17:36.071 --> 00:17:40.870
he used the poem because it gave him a bit of power English. Yes.

308
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.400
<v 1>Yes. It, it, it certainly, but I think if you'd asked him,</v>

309
00:17:45.401 --> 00:17:46.300
what would you prefer?

310
00:17:46.301 --> 00:17:49.620
Would you like to have that pause or would you like to be able to communicate

311
00:17:49.621 --> 00:17:51.270
freely here to swap to in a heartbeat?

312
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:55.980
Because he was really a communicator that he was, he wasn't, and that was,

313
00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.270
I suppose, the frustration for me,

314
00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.580
because I always felt like there's so much more to say,

315
00:17:59.581 --> 00:18:03.990
and I don't know if we're going to have time to say it all. And that was, yeah.

316
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.433
Yeah.

317
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.640
<v 0>Um, you, you,</v>

318
00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:11.270
you have many years without so much contact with him.

319
00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.530
<v 1>Yes. We went our separate ways at one point, which is,</v>

320
00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:19.340
I think fairly normal for family thing for families to do.

321
00:18:19.341 --> 00:18:23.330
I saw him through that time, but not very often.

322
00:18:23.331 --> 00:18:27.560
And perhaps not in such a close fashion as we ended up, not,

323
00:18:27.561 --> 00:18:32.450
not as closely as we ended up what brought you back together? Well, um, I, uh,

324
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:36.380
moved as, you know, the twists and turns that life takes. And I,

325
00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.010
to my brother to my own surprise actually found myself living in Cambridge with

326
00:18:40.011 --> 00:18:43.790
my son, um, as a single parent. And, uh,

327
00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:48.350
my son has autism and my parents were both really keen to be supportive.

328
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.900
And so that was actually amazing because, uh,

329
00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:54.140
my dad wanted to be involved in my son's life. My son sort of adored him.

330
00:18:54.141 --> 00:18:58.910
He thought having a granddad with wheels was coolest thing anybody could ever

331
00:18:58.911 --> 00:19:02.860
have. He was like a big fan of Thomas, the tank engine at the time book,

332
00:19:02.861 --> 00:19:07.310
his granddad as a sort of alternative tank engine kids. Um,

333
00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.220
and so we sort of naturally we started, but, you know, I was just local.

334
00:19:10.221 --> 00:19:13.670
I was just, I was just around the corner. So we started hanging out and I did,

335
00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:17.780
um, I cooked with him a lot. Um, I never mastered his favorite dish,

336
00:19:17.781 --> 00:19:21.920
which was a creme brulee, but he did eat his way through many really quite bad.

337
00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:28.460
It's really nice, very sweetly. And so we, we sort of, we, we, you know, we,

338
00:19:28.461 --> 00:19:31.370
so we started kind of just hanging out being family.

339
00:19:31.371 --> 00:19:32.870
I went on a couple of trips with him,

340
00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.230
which was a bit of an eye-opener because I hadn't been on a trip with him.

341
00:19:36.231 --> 00:19:38.450
So I hadn't really understood it.

342
00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:43.490
First hand the impact of his status as a superstar, he was, we went to,

343
00:19:43.491 --> 00:19:48.440
I went to Hong Kong with him and that was just astonishing to me because we

344
00:19:48.441 --> 00:19:50.690
would trail across Hong Kong by a press pack.

345
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:55.130
And we'd like be in this bar and we look forward and someone would say, where,

346
00:19:55.131 --> 00:19:57.650
where are, where are we going? Where are we getting off? And you'd go,

347
00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.350
we're getting off where all those people with cameras are standing.

348
00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:05.270
Cause you'd know. Um, it was just, it sort of blew my mind anyway.

349
00:20:05.271 --> 00:20:09.920
And then, um, we, my son had a birthday party and all his friends arrived.

350
00:20:09.921 --> 00:20:12.560
And then my dad came and it was like, the magician had arrived.

351
00:20:12.561 --> 00:20:16.490
Everyone was like, Oh, Oh, these kids were like, Ooh. I just thought that was,

352
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.380
I was really taken aback.

353
00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.700
And one of his little friends just sauntered up to him and said, so Stephen,

354
00:20:22.701 --> 00:20:26.510
what would happen to me if I fell in a black hole? And my dad said,

355
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:31.400
you'd be turned into spaghetti. And all the kids would deny too.

356
00:20:31.401 --> 00:20:34.340
They thought this was hilarious, but they got it at some level.

357
00:20:34.341 --> 00:20:37.850
They just understood what he had said. Um,

358
00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:40.820
and all the parents were like here. I thought it was, they spaghetti.

359
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:45.710
I was like, you don't know what this is about. And so,

360
00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.300
um, we decided to write a book about it because there's such a great question.

361
00:20:49.301 --> 00:20:51.910
Like how would a boy fall in a black hole? What would he be doing?

362
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:55.840
How would he be just hanging out in space and how would we get him back?

363
00:20:55.990 --> 00:21:00.130
And so we decided to write a fantasy novel, but make all the science real.

364
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:05.650
And this became a huge success. Now I've just the last book came out this year.

365
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.100
And the last book is kind of attribute to my father's ideas.

366
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:13.270
It takes a lot of the things he said about some of the fears he had about the

367
00:21:13.271 --> 00:21:15.850
way the world was developing and it kind of illustrates them.

368
00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:20.170
So it gives you a world of the future where some of my father's doc predictions

369
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:21.400
have actually come true.

370
00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:27.150
<v 0>And also, um, uh, the book, uh,</v>

371
00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.340
brief answers to big questions.

372
00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:31.740
<v 1>That is my father's last.</v>

373
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.730
<v 0>Book. Exactly. And you, you, you, you, you finished it in a way.</v>

374
00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.340
<v 1>We, we, we, we finished it. Um,</v>

375
00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:43.890
it's very important sort of record of what he thought on a number of really

376
00:21:43.891 --> 00:21:44.910
important topics.

377
00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:48.540
And I think my thought was that he's going to be somebody who will be thought

378
00:21:48.541 --> 00:21:51.210
about who will be talked about who will be, and people will talk.

379
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.740
And I just wanted him to have his own record, his own voice,

380
00:21:56.010 --> 00:22:00.840
his own record of what he actually thought and said, what's your own theory.

381
00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:02.580
They question, um,

382
00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:07.230
that is a really tricky one because I think he was be very,

383
00:22:07.231 --> 00:22:11.250
very proud to see the Watson side of black hole chapter because black holes that

384
00:22:11.251 --> 00:22:12.570
was really, you know, his life's work,

385
00:22:12.571 --> 00:22:14.250
black holes and the origins of the universe.

386
00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:17.640
And he told me that was something he wants to be remembered for that that was

387
00:22:17.641 --> 00:22:19.410
what he most wanted to be remembered for.

388
00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:23.670
But I also think that the chapters on AI is very important. Um,

389
00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.780
his thoughts on human survival on earth, because he was very,

390
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:32.610
he was very outspoken about climate change. Um, and also his thoughts on AI.

391
00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:36.180
And he was one of the people who at a time when we were very,

392
00:22:36.181 --> 00:22:40.980
everyone was very kind of blown away with the possibility of technology and this

393
00:22:40.981 --> 00:22:43.830
kind of massive optimism like technology will fix everything.

394
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.100
He was one of the few people to say, well, hang on a minute,

395
00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:49.440
let there's another side to this.

396
00:22:49.441 --> 00:22:53.730
Let's just think about the impact on normal people, on people,

397
00:22:53.731 --> 00:22:57.240
on their jobs, on their life. How is this actually going to work?

398
00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:01.380
How do we make sure that when we have these super advanced technologies that we

399
00:23:01.381 --> 00:23:02.580
don't leave people behind,

400
00:23:02.581 --> 00:23:06.990
we don't leave people disenfranchised and lonely and with a feeling of

401
00:23:06.991 --> 00:23:10.980
worthlessness because they haven't been able to keep up with a super-intelligent

402
00:23:10.981 --> 00:23:14.040
machine. So I think that's a very important thing that he did.

403
00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:18.330
Cause he would say these things and people would listen and there's been a

404
00:23:18.331 --> 00:23:19.590
discernible change.

405
00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:21.743
<v 0>Um,</v>

406
00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:30.150
[inaudible] I just want to one more thing because when,

407
00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:35.300
when people pass away, we, we w we're there with their things. I mean, we're,

408
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.830
we're left with their things. Um,

409
00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.660
and some of them are meaningless and some might carry meaning and some might

410
00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:47.330
carry emotional value. What do you, after him that carries emotional value?

411
00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.110
<v 1>Well, I said, um, of everything I said,</v>

412
00:23:50.111 --> 00:23:51.850
the thing I really want is the coffee grinder.

413
00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.390
I don't really want that coffee grinder.

414
00:23:55.391 --> 00:23:57.130
I was prepared to fight both my brothers for it,

415
00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:00.550
especially cause I'd been living with my dad loved proper coffee.

416
00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:04.090
And so the beans would be ground and this just very ordinary,

417
00:24:04.091 --> 00:24:07.630
small plastic coffee grinder. But it just, I don't know,

418
00:24:07.631 --> 00:24:11.950
the coffee was just the best coffee. Um, and so I said, I put my,

419
00:24:11.951 --> 00:24:14.740
I staked my claim early on to my brothers. I was like,

420
00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.550
you can have anything you like, but the coffee grinder is mine.

421
00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:22.120
And they knew from the look in my eye that I meant it. No, no one,

422
00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:23.770
no one challenged me on that.

423
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:27.680
<v 0>What happened to his famous wheelchair? I mean, that's.</v>

424
00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.050
<v 1>We have actually, we have quite a collection of wheelchairs.</v>

425
00:24:32.051 --> 00:24:35.860
We've almost got a historical collection of wheelchairs down the ages.

426
00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.510
You can see the March of technology through wheelchairs.

427
00:24:39.511 --> 00:24:42.790
So we have about at least eight wheelchairs from different periods of his life.

428
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:46.900
I find it very, I find the wheelchair too sad.

429
00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:48.580
I can't look at it because it's missing.

430
00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.510
<v 0>Lucy. It's been wonderful to talk to you. Thank you. Thank you so much.</v>
