WEBVTT

1
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.870
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.490
<v 1>Into London. Uh, we were,</v>

3
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.450
we were just talking about who was cool and who's not cool.

4
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.010
Um, um, these people are very cool. Uh,

5
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.750
and then I thought about you because you took your private jet this morning

6
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.330
and you flew through the polar vortex and you landed on the airport

7
00:00:38.331 --> 00:00:39.164
here in England,

8
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.640
and you took a helicopter to the studio and you come in here now.

9
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.030
And I think that's the coolest thing I've ever. I mean, that's.

10
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.060
<v 0>[Inaudible] like the James Bond of philanthropy. Welcome. Welcome to the CTO.</v>

11
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.953
Thank you.

12
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.830
<v 1>Um, please tell me, Mr. Gates, what is, uh,</v>

13
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.570
what is the giving pledge?

14
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.030
<v 2>Um, there's a lot of wealth that's been created,</v>

15
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.250
and the question is, uh, if you want to give that away, who can you learn from?

16
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.420
And so myself and Warren buffet, um,

17
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.010
had dinners with people who'd been very successful and talked about, you know,

18
00:01:22.011 --> 00:01:25.220
why did they believe in philanthropy and what were they going to do?

19
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.120
And we decided to create a group that would get together regularly,

20
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.470
encourage people to collaborate, to do it when they're younger,

21
00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:35.600
to do more. Uh,

22
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.490
and so this giving pledge now has 122, uh, billionaires.

23
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.540
Who've committed to give the majority of their money away and are now learning

24
00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:49.070
from each other about a habit, how to do it the best possible way.

25
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.900
<v 1>And that's what you're doing these days is how to give away your money in the</v>

26
00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:54.740
best possible way.

27
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.730
<v 2>Well, our foundation is very focused on, uh,</v>

28
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.220
the health of the poorest in the world.

29
00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:05.090
So I'm learning a lot about diseases working with scientists. Uh,

30
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.760
the foundation works my, my full-time effort.

31
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.050
<v 1>And, and, uh, this week, uh, the foundation, uh,</v>

32
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.030
the bill and Melinda Gates foundation, uh, and, and the,

33
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.860
uh, the Gates letter, uh, or Gates letter.com,

34
00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:26.600
which is a URL on that. Um, it's, what's really, it was released this week.

35
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.040
It's a lot of good news in it.

36
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.330
<v 2>That's right. Uh, we're making more progress than people are aware of. Uh,</v>

37
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.240
we've reduced the number of poor countries dramatically.

38
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.010
So the idea that they stay poor, that's, uh, a bad myth.

39
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.420
Uh, fact in the next 20 years, we'll be down to very, very few poor countries.

40
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.940
Uh, we've improved health a lot by having generous aid and actually that, uh,

41
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.200
by improving the health, ironically, you'd think if you saved kids lives, you'd,

42
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.340
you'd get more kids and you'd have population problems. In fact,

43
00:02:58.341 --> 00:03:02.890
as you improve health, uh, families decide voluntarily to have less kids.

44
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:07.300
So actually health is how you make sure that we were going to hit a peak

45
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:12.040
population and not have the type of feeding and educating and

46
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.580
environmental problems we'd have if the population kept growing.

47
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.900
So all good news.

48
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.350
<v 1>It's, it's quite, it's quite a prediction you have.</v>

49
00:03:19.351 --> 00:03:21.260
It's a very audacious prediction that,

50
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.680
that when you are eight years old yourself into 35, right,

51
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.770
35, then there will be almost no poor countries.

52
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.030
<v 2>That's right.</v>

53
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.470
And I think people aren't aware of that because you see headlines about all the

54
00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:39.210
setbacks, but this gradual improvement where countries like Brazil,

55
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.320
Korea, Mexico, China, that were once very poor, you know,

56
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.060
in 1960, almost every country in the world was poor except for the West.

57
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.110
And now we've moved them up. So they're almost all middle income.

58
00:03:52.111 --> 00:03:56.250
They don't need aid. The number of countries left that need aid is, uh,

59
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.720
you know, about 50 or 60. And what I'm saying is that we'll drop down.

60
00:04:00.721 --> 00:04:03.150
There'll be less than 10 of those. Uh,

61
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:08.190
if we keep being generous and being smart about improving the health and

62
00:04:08.191 --> 00:04:10.980
agriculture of these poor countries, so that, you know,

63
00:04:10.981 --> 00:04:15.380
it's good news that I'm afraid the normal way people see headlines, they,

64
00:04:15.381 --> 00:04:18.600
they might not be aware of it. They might, uh, think it's all true.

65
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.330
<v 1>How often do people say, sorry, Mr. Gates, that's just not possible.</v>

66
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.810
<v 2>There's a lot of cynicism. Uh,</v>

67
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.760
and in most people don't get to go to Africa as much as I

68
00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:37.080
do and look at the numbers. Uh, they just see that some aid program,

69
00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:40.440
2% of the money was spent corruptly. And, uh, you know,

70
00:04:40.441 --> 00:04:44.880
that's played up the bad news of an epidemic or a dictator taking over.

71
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.410
Uh, and so things like, uh, polio eradication,

72
00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:54.150
where in the next five years, we think we can end that disease for all time.

73
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.840
You.

74
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.490
<v 1>All did it. You already did in India.</v>

75
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.770
<v 2>India. Yeah. It's gone three years now with no cases. So we just celebrated, uh,</v>

76
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.480
that kind of certification. We've still got it in, um, uh,

77
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.390
five countries right now. So we've got work to do, but we're,

78
00:05:09.391 --> 00:05:11.070
we're optimistic on that as well.

79
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.310
<v 1>How should, how should we think about foreign aid?</v>

80
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.660
<v 2>Well,</v>

81
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.340
eight generosity saves lives and it buys vaccines by

82
00:05:20.341 --> 00:05:24.810
seeds for farmers. And so I'm always encouraging countries to be more generous.

83
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.670
In fact, three of the most generous in the world are Norway, Sweden,

84
00:05:29.671 --> 00:05:32.100
and Denmark. So your, your viewers to observe it.

85
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:39.270
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

86
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.180
<v 1>We can, we don't have to bother so much anymore.</v>

87
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.750
<v 2>Keep up the good work. You need to keep it going. Uh,</v>

88
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.500
there's often people come along and say, no, no, uh,

89
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.120
or cynical about it, but it really is out there making a huge difference.

90
00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:58.160
I wish everybody could go and see, uh, the impact it, there are.

91
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.130
<v 1>After all, all the ways to be a philanthropist,</v>

92
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.420
you could like give the museum, you see him a new wing or something.

93
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.730
<v 2>Yeah. That's not my thing.</v>

94
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:11.643
<v 0>Uh.</v>

95
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.350
<v 2>You know, mothers want their children to live.</v>

96
00:06:14.351 --> 00:06:19.210
And the fact that we haven't taken the latest science and, uh,

97
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.980
put, created a malaria vaccine, you know, it's still, uh,

98
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.840
over 600,000 kids a year dying of malaria. Uh,

99
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.970
and you know, why hasn't science made that a priority? Well, philanthropy,

100
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.840
there's no market for it because it's poor people who can't, uh,

101
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.550
spend to buy it. And so either government or philanthropy has to step in,

102
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:43.121
you know,

103
00:06:43.121 --> 00:06:47.680
creating new seeds that let African farmers who are a third as pro productive

104
00:06:47.681 --> 00:06:52.510
as, uh, enrich countries today, moving that up. So their kids have nutrition.

105
00:06:52.511 --> 00:06:57.430
They can raise the school fees they need. Um, that's a lot more fun,

106
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.200
you know, I don't know what I'm no expert on heart. Uh, and it's,

107
00:07:02.201 --> 00:07:05.140
I'm not criticizing that that's for other people to work on.

108
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.820
<v 1>But you talk about the barking myths. What,</v>

109
00:07:09.821 --> 00:07:12.460
what is the most irritating myth about you?

110
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.610
<v 2>Well, I wouldn't say there's anything that's irritating.</v>

111
00:07:15.611 --> 00:07:20.500
People are very nice to me. Uh, I'd say that, uh,

112
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.540
you know, the myth might be that, um, uh,

113
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.930
the most generous philanthropist of all time,

114
00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:32.740
which in a pure economic sense, you know, through my life,

115
00:07:32.741 --> 00:07:34.360
I'll give away over a hundred billion.

116
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:36.543
<v 0>But</v>

117
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:43.210
[inaudible].

118
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:48.160
<v 2>Somebody who chooses to live in Africa and work in a hospital or give money.</v>

119
00:07:48.161 --> 00:07:52.030
So they're giving up a vacation or something they need, you know,

120
00:07:52.031 --> 00:07:56.440
I've not had to sacrifice, as you said, I have the plane, uh, you know,

121
00:07:56.441 --> 00:07:58.900
when I want to get a hammer, I get a hammer. Uh,

122
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:04.060
and so I've not really sacrificed my time or

123
00:08:04.061 --> 00:08:05.860
my, uh, you know,

124
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:10.720
economic wellbeing in the same way that a lots of unnamed amazing

125
00:08:10.721 --> 00:08:14.830
people do. So they're, you know, the world's best philanthropists.

126
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:21.310
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

127
00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:26.110
<v 1>You walked into a store and you saw something that you wanted and you</v>

128
00:08:26.111 --> 00:08:27.700
thought, Oh, no, that's too expensive.

129
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:33.490
<v 2>I have very expensive tastes. Uh, you know,</v>

130
00:08:33.491 --> 00:08:37.000
when I decided to buy a plane, that was pretty expensive.

131
00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:41.800
That's my big splurge. Uh, but I couldn't be here without it. So.

132
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:48.320
<v 1>I love that plan. You, you,</v>

133
00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.220
we were talking about lists say because he's on a lot of lists

134
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:56.320
among other lists, one of the most intelligent in world, uh,

135
00:08:56.321 --> 00:09:00.960
and you're number one on the list that was, uh, that was made, um,

136
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.250
uh, publicly recently, uh, a list, uh,

137
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:09.240
of the most influential, most admired people in the world.

138
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.990
And your number one, would that count for your

139
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.670
[inaudible] count? Is it, is it like that at home, around your dinner table?

140
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.240
I'm not number one at home. [inaudible].

141
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.440
<v 2>Well, people are nice to me, but I, you know, uh,</v>

142
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.350
my wife, Belinda sh you know, she does the most with the kids. And, uh,

143
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.540
I think she'd, she'd rank pretty high.

144
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.590
<v 1>What about your parents? Uh, your father is still working with you.</v>

145
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.350
Uh, how important is, is he in your life? Your mother is, she has passed.

146
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:50.210
<v 2>Yeah. My mom, uh, passed away about 20 years ago. Uh,</v>

147
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:53.840
my dad was a lawyer, uh, and then after he retired,

148
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.200
he volunteered to help me get the foundation going, uh,

149
00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:01.420
and he's still involved, comes in, uh, and, uh,

150
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:05.750
he just turned 88. Uh, so he's, uh, you know,

151
00:10:05.751 --> 00:10:10.250
still likes to work, uh, his hearing isn't at its peak.

152
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:15.860
Uh, but, uh, his, uh, integrity and example is, is still, uh,

153
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:16.880
extremely valuable.

154
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.940
<v 1>Have you often, I mean, have you changed through the years as a,</v>

155
00:10:21.941 --> 00:10:26.690
as a person and, and, and I mean, doing this kind of work,

156
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.530
uh, because before there was a very different kind of work working with machines

157
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:35.780
and, and I mean, that's, that's a total different thing.

158
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:40.100
Have you changed as a person as well? I haven't been consulted.

159
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:45.350
<v 2>Oh, certainly. Uh, Ben, you know, it's age, you mellow. Um,</v>

160
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.940
in my twenties, I didn't believe in vacation. I didn't believe in weekends. Uh,

161
00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.111
and you know,

162
00:10:51.111 --> 00:10:55.430
I thought people who took Saturday and Sunday off were kind of wimpy and, uh,

163
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:57.001
uh, and,

164
00:10:57.001 --> 00:11:01.280
and then I started taking weekends off and then I started taking vacations. And,

165
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.300
uh, you know, now I'm, I'm far more normal in that respect, you know, I,

166
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:08.870
I used to believe in, you know, staying all night at work, you know,

167
00:11:08.871 --> 00:11:13.400
if possible two nights in a row that was kind of a cool macho thing. Now,

168
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.100
I'm not, not, I'm not good at that. Uh,

169
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:20.210
I won't make good decisions if I don't don't get some sleep. So yeah,

170
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.560
both in terms of, uh, how you work with people in teams,

171
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:30.230
um, how you empower them, you know, hopefully you get better as you get older.

172
00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.670
Now, your, your pure genius, your cleverness may not may peak in its twenties.

173
00:11:34.671 --> 00:11:37.160
I don't know. It's hard to measure these things. Uh,

174
00:11:37.161 --> 00:11:40.280
so you should give up a little bit of that. You get, uh,

175
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.850
something where you can help others, uh, in their young years,

176
00:11:43.851 --> 00:11:45.110
do their very best work.

177
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:51.110
<v 1>You are known as a very competitive person. Uh, um, and, uh,</v>

178
00:11:51.111 --> 00:11:55.450
I must, I must ask you back in the days, was the Apple,

179
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:58.630
Apple boss, Steve jobs was here,

180
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.550
favorites opponent.

181
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:06.270
<v 2>Well, he and I, in a weird sense, kind of grew up together. Uh,</v>

182
00:12:06.271 --> 00:12:10.950
I did the software for the Apple two, which was their first product. Um,

183
00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:15.390
Microsoft did most of the software for the original Macintosh.

184
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.210
So we actually have more people working on that than Apple did.

185
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.570
So that was kind of a, a joint, uh, success.

186
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.810
Then Steve left Apple, uh,

187
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.410
did a company called next that I chose not to support cause I didn't think it

188
00:12:28.411 --> 00:12:32.640
would sell very well. And it didn't. Uh, Dan,

189
00:12:32.641 --> 00:12:33.900
when he came back to Apple,

190
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.140
we did a deal to support Apple and help it get going again.

191
00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:41.610
And then he did such a phenomenal job that

192
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:46.110
the, his phones, his tablets started to dominate the industry.

193
00:12:46.111 --> 00:12:48.950
And Apple actually became, uh, uh,

194
00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:53.790
a bigger company even than Microsoft, which for us up until then, we'd been,

195
00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.550
uh, more profitable. So did this mindblowing job.

196
00:12:56.551 --> 00:13:00.090
And in that period were more competitors. We still saw each other.

197
00:13:00.091 --> 00:13:02.310
And then as he got sick, I got, uh,

198
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.450
several chances to sit and talk to him at length about how lucky we'd been. And,

199
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.750
um, you know, he was a unique person and,

200
00:13:11.751 --> 00:13:16.440
and in a lot of wonderful ways and in some pretty extreme ways. So, you know,

201
00:13:16.441 --> 00:13:20.370
he, he pushed things even harder than I do. So, uh,

202
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.290
quite quite unique because.

203
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.860
<v 1>You both had like quite a reputation and,</v>

204
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:29.490
and P I don't know if people knew how close you were.

205
00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:32.700
<v 2>Well, they there's been some,</v>

206
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:37.740
we did a thing together that Walt Mossberg had to sit and talk about how we'd

207
00:13:37.741 --> 00:13:41.640
enjoyed our, our work together. Uh, that was about a year before Steve died.

208
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:46.770
And then the Walter Isaacson book talks about, uh, an afternoon.

209
00:13:46.771 --> 00:13:50.070
I spent with Steve that was literally, uh,

210
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.810
just five weeks before he died.

211
00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:58.530
<v 1>We were discussing chess here with the, with the Magnus and also intelligence.</v>

212
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.580
Uh, and that intelligence can be many things. Uh,

213
00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:08.040
and you are obviously a very smart person, but when are you not?

214
00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.380
When I play chess with him.

215
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:17.100
<v 2>I want to try it. Uh, well, w it's a predetermined outcome, uh.</v>

216
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.270
<v 1>Because we, we, we know it might be, uh, but,</v>

217
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.110
but you should know that he played with, uh, Zuckerberg,

218
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:30.480
uh, last week and it didn't go well for him either.

219
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:35.040
So he shouldn't be too nervous. [inaudible].

220
00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:39.600
<v 2>It was over 2100 players to players about 1600. It goes pretty quickly.</v>

221
00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:43.950
<v 1>Yes, this is this. This must be, if we, because we have a table here,</v>

222
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:48.150
so is it if it's okay by you? Is it okay by you sure.

223
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.940
Describe how will be it's it's speed. Chess, right?

224
00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.330
I'll have 30 seconds. Uh, you can have as much time as you want.

225
00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:05.170
And then, uh, then we'll see how it goes, punching a clock or not.

226
00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:09.550
We haven't gotten to the clock, have the board MPS.

227
00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:11.463
Oh, this is exciting.

228
00:15:18.070 --> 00:15:18.903
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

229
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:25.240
<v 1>[Inaudible], I'm actually fairly good at goals. Board game.</v>

230
00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.820
Did you know before you started,

231
00:15:27.821 --> 00:15:30.850
did you know that you were partly to thank for his success? Actually,

232
00:15:30.851 --> 00:15:35.350
I didn't know that. I'm glad to hear it as a sponsor in the beginning. Super

233
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:44.170
[inaudible] The game, his home.

234
00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:51.243
<v 0>Oops.</v>

235
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.770
<v 1>Oh, that was quick. Oh, that was bad.</v>

236
00:16:58.570 --> 00:16:59.403
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

237
00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.180
<v 1>I usually last longer, I think</v>

238
00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.380
on this particular occasion,

239
00:17:05.381 --> 00:17:10.270
I had to violate one of my main principles that I never

240
00:17:10.271 --> 00:17:13.210
played for cheap tricks. And in this case,

241
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:15.790
this case I did, if,

242
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:19.840
if he had played rookie one here,

243
00:17:19.841 --> 00:17:23.440
instead of giving an air hole for the queen now for the King, I would,

244
00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:27.580
I would have had a losing position. So whatever, I wouldn't understand

245
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.350
[inaudible] I will say thank you very much for taking the time to be here with

246
00:17:41.351 --> 00:17:43.090
us tonight. Uh,

247
00:17:43.091 --> 00:17:47.890
it's it's been a joy to have you on the show and good luck with your

248
00:17:47.891 --> 00:17:49.590
work you're on your way to devils.

249
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.023
<v 0>What's going to happen there.</v>

250
00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:56.180
<v 2>Uh, just a bunch of meetings, hopefully, uh, I'll spread the good news in my,</v>

251
00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.810
uh, uh, annual letter and get people committed to more,

252
00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.250
more help for poor countries.

253
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:03.410
<v 0>No party, uh.</v>

254
00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:07.460
<v 2>Not for me, but it, uh, maybe for other people.</v>

255
00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:09.980
<v 0>Do you never party?</v>

256
00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.030
<v 2>You know, I, I sit and talk to people, but most animals,</v>

257
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:18.830
I talk about malaria and tuberculosis for people who liked that.

258
00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:19.880
I am a fun guy.

259
00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:24.470
<v 0>Thank you very much. Yeah. Thank you.</v>

260
00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:44.540
[inaudible] good luck with the Gates letter, the.com uh, the market,

261
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:45.020
and let's do it again.
