1
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.330
<v 0>It's hard. It's hard to believe.</v>

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.830
It's hard to believe what I said like this across you, but, but,

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.210
but Henry Kissinger, the national security advisor,

4
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.860
uh, uh, he, he called you the most dangerous man in America.

5
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.060
Do you, do you know if he's still of that opinion?

6
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.750
<v 1>Quite possibly. Uh,</v>

7
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.890
he knew that I was dangerous to his Nixon's Vietnam policy

8
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.510
because he knew that I knew the truth of what that policy was,

9
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:34.430
which they were lying to the public about.

10
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.690
He knew that I knew they weren't threatening nuclear weapons at that time

11
00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:42.020
against North Vietnam was very important that I not reveal that.

12
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.100
<v 0>Um, I want to talk to you about top security clearance,</v>

13
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.730
and I know there are several levels of top security clearance.

14
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.070
How does that change a person?

15
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.310
<v 1>Well, as I said to Kissinger,</v>

16
00:00:55.311 --> 00:00:57.890
when I was working for him at the beginning of the administration,

17
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.720
I want to give you some advice if I can, on the effect this has, uh,

18
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.160
at first I said at first,

19
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.110
the first reaction will be amazement that all this information existed and

20
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:12.950
you'll feel like a fool that, uh, you didn't know about it before,

21
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.140
even though you knew top secret material,

22
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.730
but after a little while you get used to it and you feel that everyone else who

23
00:01:19.731 --> 00:01:22.070
doesn't have the clearances is a fool.

24
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.540
And you'll find that you'll be speaking to people and saying,

25
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.460
what would they be telling me if they knew what I knew, which by the way,

26
00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:34.310
what he knew might be true or false, it was just highly secret.

27
00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:37.940
It didn't have to be true. What would they do? Well, that's too complicated.

28
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.130
So you'll stop listening and all you'll be doing is you won't run from anyone.

29
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.140
You'll just think of what you want to tell them what you want them to believe.

30
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.360
You'll become something like a sear sees captives

31
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.750
in, uh, the Odyssey who, uh,

32
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.970
had a potion that turned men into swine.

33
00:01:58.971 --> 00:02:03.740
They couldn't communicate like men anymore at the time. Uh,

34
00:02:03.741 --> 00:02:06.890
yes, I was telling him what I'd gone through. And I think everyone had,

35
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.740
who'd had these clearances. And I must say that, uh,

36
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.390
a year later when I was advising him to read the Pentagon papers in San

37
00:02:14.391 --> 00:02:18.350
Clemente, and I was describing his Cambodia invasion,

38
00:02:18.351 --> 00:02:21.740
which led to the resignations of these other people as, uh,

39
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.820
not looking that different from, uh, uh, other people.

40
00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:29.510
And he'd been advised to that extent by some of his colleagues from Harvard

41
00:02:29.511 --> 00:02:33.260
earlier, Tom shelling and some others. And he said,

42
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.970
but they didn't have the clearances. So he couldn't take them seriously.

43
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.470
And I saw that he had imbibed CRCs potion, uh,

44
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.560
and was out of communication. He wasn't able to learn.

45
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.200
<v 0>You were, you were a man of war in a way. You were a part of the,</v>

46
00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:55.070
the, the, the war effort and, and a very important part as well.

47
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.700
W looking back, what, what is the,

48
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.510
the success you've had you had back then that you today regret the most?

49
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.310
<v 1>I couldn't say I had any success. Uh,</v>

50
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.380
you might've the state's policy as a whole.

51
00:03:10.381 --> 00:03:14.730
I can't think of anyone who would look back and say that our policy succeeded in

52
00:03:14.731 --> 00:03:17.070
any way or that they'd had any useful.

53
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.960
<v 0>No, but what do you regret the most that you, you tried and you managed,</v>

54
00:03:21.961 --> 00:03:22.990
and then you regretted it?

55
00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.330
<v 1>Oh, by far I regret that I did not reveal</v>

56
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.110
early in 1961, before I worked on Vietnam,

57
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.480
the nuclear documents that were then in my possession and which were insane and

58
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.220
murder is to a degree that humans had never imagined in

59
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.054
human history.

60
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.710
And I've regretted ever since that's over half a century that I didn't reveal

61
00:03:46.711 --> 00:03:49.050
those at the time when I had them.

62
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.440
<v 0>Talk about that, uh, in a short while. But I, I.</v>

63
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.090
<v 1>Itself, I put out the Pentagon papers to the Senate in 1969.</v>

64
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.870
They did not hold hearings. I gave them to the press in 1971.

65
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.670
This was the history of our horrible decision-making in Vietnam. Uh,

66
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.390
from 1945 to 68, became known as the Pentagon papers.

67
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.030
I regret that I had not put all those documents out in 64 before the war had

68
00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:19.470
really begun, uh, in a big way when it might really have prevented the war. Uh,

69
00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:22.110
that's a heavy weight on my shoulders that I didn't do that.

70
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.280
<v 0>But do you, you weren't, I mean, after all, you were a Marine and you came from,</v>

71
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.420
from, from the, the military side and, and, uh,

72
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.920
I don't know if you, how to, what degree you were in combat or.

73
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.820
<v 1>I was in the Marines, uh, during peace time, uh,</v>

74
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.950
essentially except for the Suez crisis,

75
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.730
which where I was going to Alexandria Harbor, but, um, uh,

76
00:04:44.731 --> 00:04:47.220
that was in peace time from 54 to 57.

77
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.770
And then later I was in Vietnam from 65 to 67 and there I was a

78
00:04:52.771 --> 00:04:54.420
civilian for the state department.

79
00:04:54.421 --> 00:04:58.320
I switched from the defense department at the highest level to the state

80
00:04:58.321 --> 00:04:59.154
department.

81
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.000
<v 0>Being a part of the, the American war effort. Um,</v>

82
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.680
dating a peace activists as you did, because your wife,

83
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.540
I became, yeah. Uh, did this changed you? I mean, how,

84
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.890
how did that work?

85
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.390
<v 1>The greatest influence on me was, um,</v>

86
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.260
meeting young man in those days,

87
00:05:22.261 --> 00:05:27.000
it was old man graft resistors who had been influenced by Gandhi and by Martin

88
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:30.360
Luther King and Rosa parks, and were living that life.

89
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.580
And they were using their own lives to make the strongest protests they could

90
00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:38.790
against the war, uh, going to prison, uh,

91
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.790
by non-violent refusal to cooperate with the draft.

92
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.460
And when I met people like that, I realized,

93
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.330
I thought of the war the way they did it, that it was wrong, that it should end.

94
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.840
And seeing their example was what put into my mind,

95
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.910
what could I now do to help in this war now that I'm ready to go to prison?

96
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.490
Or was that something.

97
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.700
<v 0>That evolved or did this happen overnight?</v>

98
00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.110
<v 1>That particular perception happened very quickly.</v>

99
00:06:05.111 --> 00:06:08.140
When I saw somebody that I was very impressed by, uh,

100
00:06:08.141 --> 00:06:11.230
announced that he was on his way to prison, which I hadn't foreseen.

101
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.250
I was very a thunder struck by that. Really. In fact,

102
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.280
I went to a men's room at the end of the auditorium,

103
00:06:18.281 --> 00:06:23.080
and I sat down and looked at cried for a long time at what my country had become

104
00:06:23.081 --> 00:06:26.470
that what seemed like the best young men of our country,

105
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.980
that the best thing they could do was to go to prison.

106
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.690
And I thought my country has come to this. It was very, uh,

107
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.310
wrenching and that's, as I say, when I got up from that, wash my face and said,

108
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:40.960
all right, now,

109
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.860
what can I do if I'm ready now that I'm ready to go to prison as they were.

110
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.001
And it was, uh,

111
00:06:46.001 --> 00:06:50.980
within a few weeks that I started cupping the 7,000 top secret pages of

112
00:06:50.981 --> 00:06:51.910
the Pentagon papers,

113
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.570
the history of the war in hopes that that would help shorten the war.

114
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.940
<v 0>Do you think this would happen? Do you think you will,</v>

115
00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.740
you would be that with lower without having met Patricia you're you're

116
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.193
still, still your wife.

117
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.920
<v 1>I could say that because Patricia was against the war, uh,</v>

118
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:14.350
good in a way. So was I, but I was trying to make it less violent LIS uh,

119
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.030
murderous, Reedy than it was. And we broke up over that issue in Vietnam.

120
00:07:19.031 --> 00:07:23.530
I felt she was holding me responsible for the whole aspect of the war.

121
00:07:23.531 --> 00:07:27.340
We came back from my, uh, uh, party were from Negal Sheehan,

122
00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.840
who was the reporter, who to whom I later gave the Pentagon paper who, uh,

123
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:32.980
was leaving Vietnam.

124
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.180
And she had met a diplomat who had been in Hanoi and described the bombing of

125
00:07:37.181 --> 00:07:41.860
civilians, of factories, of, uh, hospitals and bridges and whatnot.

126
00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:46.240
And she said, how to me, how can you be part of this?

127
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.110
And I thought at the time that was unfair. I was trying to stop the bombing,

128
00:07:50.111 --> 00:07:52.870
which I didn't believe in. I was trying to do this and that, I thought,

129
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.570
how can I was engaged at the time? I said,

130
00:07:55.571 --> 00:07:59.050
how can I marry someone who doesn't give me the benefit of the doubt? You know,

131
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.900
and I broke it off essentially for three years.

132
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.880
Of course later I came to realize she was right. I was part of it.

133
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.370
<v 0>And the Pentagon papers was about, about the war in Vietnam.</v>

134
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.210
It was a lot of information that was kept from the American people about how

135
00:08:16.211 --> 00:08:17.110
that war went.

136
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.330
<v 1>I intended to give all the documents before on nuclear planning, threats,</v>

137
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.770
nuclear threats plans for the destruction of

138
00:08:26.771 --> 00:08:29.650
hundreds of millions of people, uh,

139
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.630
actually grotesque plans and tended to put them out after the Pentagon papers.

140
00:08:34.631 --> 00:08:39.220
I thought the Pentagon papers deal with the war where the bombs are falling now.

141
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.340
And I should try to do that now toward the others,

142
00:08:42.341 --> 00:08:46.540
with my brother who eventually stored them in a trash dump,

143
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:51.400
uh, in New York, uh, buried them. And unfortunately,

144
00:08:51.401 --> 00:08:55.210
while I was on trial with the intention, I would put them out. After my trial,

145
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.050
the first trial, I thought there would be a number of trials.

146
00:08:58.051 --> 00:08:59.970
And I would certainly go to prison in the end.

147
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.620
<v 0>She didn't, she'd be sad because it was a miss miss, miss.</v>

148
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.340
<v 1>Distributed, all this ground of the trashy.</v>

149
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.900
And my brother was never able to recover the box and then a garbage bag in which

150
00:09:11.901 --> 00:09:15.920
these documents were. So that was, that's what I regretted.

151
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.540
That's a great regret of my life.

152
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.260
<v 0>So a hurricane took the papers in a way.</v>

153
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:26.330
<v 1>Uh, distributed them by the he'd had an iron stove, uh,</v>

154
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.980
marketing the place where he'd buried them.

155
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:31.550
It was moved about a hundred yards by the hurricane.

156
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.880
He used a bulldozer and various things to try to recover this.

157
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.660
And he got a lot of garbage bags, but none with top secret documents in it.

158
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.540
<v 0>Because these are papers that probably would have changed history even more.</v>

159
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.180
<v 1>I would hope that they did the history is, uh,</v>

160
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.720
the most dangerous and tragic kind.

161
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:55.370
It's been my hope ever since the change that without the documents, eventually,

162
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.160
uh, in this book, I give the substance to the doomsday machine.

163
00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.640
I give the substance of that as I could have done then,

164
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.700
but no publisher was willing to do it without the documents.

165
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.560
They didn't think people were interested in nuclear weapons then,

166
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:14.390
or now this current book of mine was submitted to 17 publishers before

167
00:10:14.391 --> 00:10:15.224
Bloomsbury.

168
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.120
<v 0>But tell me, I'm just getting curious here, because your brother,</v>

169
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.590
uh, was the one that hit the papers. Uh,

170
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:29.840
how did he explain what happened to the papers? I mean,

171
00:10:29.841 --> 00:10:34.250
that must've been a difficult one. That phone call must've been a difficult one.

172
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.840
<v 1>Yeah. He didn't do it on the phone would have been listened to quite a bit,</v>

173
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:40.940
but he did tell me when he was able to see me.

174
00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:44.480
And he actually did attempt to keep, uh, trying to find them.

175
00:10:44.481 --> 00:10:48.950
And for over a year, he was spending every weekend. Uh, in fact,

176
00:10:48.951 --> 00:10:53.240
at one point he had the help of a friend of his, a woman who was a,

177
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:54.441
which among other things,

178
00:10:54.441 --> 00:10:58.340
and with a dowsing rod attempted to see if she could find where these things

179
00:10:58.341 --> 00:11:02.690
were that didn't work either. But, uh, in the end I had to conclude that, uh,

180
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.480
they were gone. So that was,

181
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.570
that's probably the greatest regret of my life, uh,

182
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.210
along with not having put out the Pentagon papers.

183
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.620
<v 0>Yeah. I want to talk about the new care threat,</v>

184
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:20.030
because it's something that most people, uh,

185
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.670
they don't think about it every day, no, uh.

186
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.740
<v 1>Or any day people think that the problem went away with the cold war and on</v>

187
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.410
the end of the cold war and say in 1991,

188
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:34.520
unfortunately the weapons didn't go away and they remain on alert.

189
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:39.830
They have the same potential for extinguishing most human life on earth

190
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:44.330
that they did 70 years ago, 60 years ago, 30 years ago,

191
00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:48.800
essentially the threat has remained even though the numbers have gone down,

192
00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.320
but the numbers were so grotesquely,

193
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:55.840
a larger number than was necessary to end life on earth.

194
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:57.280
That it's still true.

195
00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:02.970
<v 0>The, the fact that we are after all still here and it's gone well</v>

196
00:12:02.971 --> 00:12:03.804
so far.

197
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.420
<v 1>Yes, that's right. As the man said,</v>

198
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.030
jumping from the top of the 50th floor and he passes the 28th

199
00:12:12.031 --> 00:12:15.060
floor so far so good. And

200
00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.820
I think it's been by an enormous luck.

201
00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:25.710
<v 0>But, but how, how many people have access to the button? I mean,</v>

202
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:26.573
how.

203
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:27.571
<v 1>Well, you know,</v>

204
00:12:27.571 --> 00:12:32.190
there's a mistaken belief that a nuclear weapon States starting with the U S

205
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:33.091
only one,

206
00:12:33.091 --> 00:12:37.890
man can authorize the use of those weapons that has never been

207
00:12:37.891 --> 00:12:39.990
true. And how many altogether?

208
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:44.280
I don't think any president has ever known how far actually it could go.

209
00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:45.630
It's not a small number.

210
00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:49.290
<v 0>What are you most afraid of that it will start in a small scale,</v>

211
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.280
or that will be.

212
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:52.710
<v 1>The, a over Ukraine.</v>

213
00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:57.810
Is there any armed conflict with Russia between Russia and the U S has

214
00:12:57.811 --> 00:13:00.420
a high likelihood of becoming nuclear?

215
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.680
And if that happens with whatever weapons, small tactical weapons,

216
00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:06.300
intermediate range, missiles,

217
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:10.920
whatever that will escalate to an all-out exchange almost surely.

218
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.980
And what we've known, as I said for 35 years,

219
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:18.450
is that that doesn't mean killing just billions of people.

220
00:13:18.451 --> 00:13:22.890
It involves killing about 7 billion people because of

221
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:26.160
effects that I think very few people are yet aware of. Can I,

222
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:30.750
can I mention what, let me put this in, in to, well, first of all,

223
00:13:30.751 --> 00:13:33.540
what I've just described is that, uh,

224
00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:37.320
in a Swedish journal actually MBO, uh, back in 1982,

225
00:13:37.321 --> 00:13:39.750
and then Carl Sagan and others in 83,

226
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.730
revealed that smoke from burning cities would be lofted by the

227
00:13:44.731 --> 00:13:45.420
explosions,

228
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.770
into the stratosphere where it wouldn't burn out where it wouldn't rain out and

229
00:13:49.771 --> 00:13:54.450
quickly surround the globe blocking 70% of the sunlight,

230
00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.490
which would mean ice age conditions on the face of the earth throughout the

231
00:13:59.491 --> 00:14:02.700
globe for over a decade. And more significantly,

232
00:14:02.701 --> 00:14:06.450
even in the cold would kill all the harvests.

233
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.820
And within a matter of months to a year,

234
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.180
nearly everyone would die of starvation.

235
00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:16.770
The numbers who died from famine from that effect will greatly outweigh the

236
00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:19.530
numbers that will die from the immediate effects.

237
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:23.190
Why we've tolerated this.

238
00:14:23.191 --> 00:14:26.340
I think it goes back to an earlier stage when we didn't know about this,

239
00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:31.890
when I was working for Bundy and president Kennedy, I'd drafted a question,

240
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.400
uh, for the president to give to the joint chiefs of staff.

241
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.090
And the question was, if you're, if our plans are carried out,

242
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:43.110
which were first strike plans, not starting a war,

243
00:14:43.111 --> 00:14:45.720
but starting a nuclear phase of a war. If there,

244
00:14:45.721 --> 00:14:49.410
as you say was an earlier conflict of some sort over Berlin,

245
00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:53.660
you'll go Slavia Iran, uh, an uprising in the East, East or whatnot.

246
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.920
Our plans were to initiate our major,

247
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.790
all out war plan against the Soviet union and China,

248
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.910
even though China had not been involved, uh,

249
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:09.530
we were going to destroy the Sino Soviet block, even if it started over Berlin.

250
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.900
So I wanted to know if they understood just how many people

251
00:15:14.901 --> 00:15:17.360
would die. If that happened. It turned out.

252
00:15:17.361 --> 00:15:22.340
They did almost to my surprise within a week or two first week was first

253
00:15:22.341 --> 00:15:27.020
came back in the USSR and China alone.

254
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:32.720
We would kill 325 million people.

255
00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.730
And a week later, they came back with the figures for the rest of the world.

256
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.500
As we death. It turned out that East Europe,

257
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.760
which I hadn't included in the first a hundred million more would die their

258
00:15:46.761 --> 00:15:50.330
attacks on their defenses or their bases. And from fallout,

259
00:15:50.331 --> 00:15:54.410
from radioactive fallout, coating the dust and earth.

260
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:58.430
That's drawn up by a nuclear explosion with radioactivity that is lethal for a

261
00:15:58.431 --> 00:16:02.120
very wide area, a hundred million in West Europe.

262
00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:06.920
Our allies NATO allies would die from our own weapons without a single

263
00:16:06.921 --> 00:16:11.840
warhead landing there from the radioactive fallout and a hundred million in

264
00:16:11.841 --> 00:16:16.040
the neutral and contiguous areas to the Soviet union,

265
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:20.360
including all of Scandinavia, Finland, for example,

266
00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:24.680
would be wiped out by the fallout from weapons on the sub patterns,

267
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:29.270
and then grid with Finland, also radio Sweden,

268
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:33.110
a neutral country, Norway, a, uh, uh,

269
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:37.720
NATO member wiped out by our own followed to that,

270
00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:42.770
had these estimates, this amounted to 600 million people,

271
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:46.010
a hundred Holocaust by our attack.

272
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.420
Add to that the effects of, uh, the Russian response,

273
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:54.860
which would annihilate Europe, whichever way the wind blew, not from fallout,

274
00:16:54.861 --> 00:16:56.360
but from blast and radiation.

275
00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:01.610
I've always wondered as I worked with NATO and I wrote a speech to NATO for

276
00:17:01.611 --> 00:17:04.370
McNamara, cosmic clearance and so forth,

277
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:09.320
did the people McNamara was addressing understand that we were talking about

278
00:17:09.321 --> 00:17:13.100
plans that led to their total annihilation.

279
00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:17.960
And yet that's been true from then to now. I've never been clear when,

280
00:17:17.961 --> 00:17:22.160
when they demanded that they be quote defended, uh,

281
00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.740
by this or when countries like Sweden.

282
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:30.110
And so I now understand it from a book by Robert Dellschau hoped that by being

283
00:17:30.111 --> 00:17:34.880
neutral and having no weapons on their territory like Norway or

284
00:17:34.881 --> 00:17:39.230
Denmark, no weapons, they would not be targets in the initial detect.

285
00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:43.220
They didn't seem to understand that that seemed to believe that to be

286
00:17:43.221 --> 00:17:48.200
annihilated in a nuclear war, you had to be targeted. That's not true,

287
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:52.290
totally not true. There's no neutrality in a thermonuclear war.

288
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:55.410
They were subject to be annihilated like everybody else,

289
00:17:56.010 --> 00:18:00.570
radioactivity and smoke doesn't pay attention to national borders

290
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.920
or to neutrality or to friend or enemy. It gets everybody.

291
00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:10.640
<v 0>Um, Danielle, this is, this is, um, uh,</v>

292
00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.260
devastating to, to, to hear about that,

293
00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:16.880
that these were actual estimates that they could make,

294
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.530
uh, but not talk about, of course, um,

295
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:25.580
you became the ultimate whistleblower, um,

296
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:30.770
of your time. Uh, why do you think there are so few with lovers?

297
00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:36.140
<v 1>Well, I've asked myself that, uh, for a long time, uh,</v>

298
00:18:36.141 --> 00:18:41.090
it's obvious that I was put on trial facing 12 felony counts, 10 years,

299
00:18:41.091 --> 00:18:42.020
each, uh,

300
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:47.030
115 year possible sentence that was meant to slow other people down

301
00:18:47.031 --> 00:18:50.510
from following this example. And you would expect that it would,

302
00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.030
that there wouldn't be too many people who would decide to do this.

303
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.040
Why almost none.

304
00:18:55.730 --> 00:19:00.470
Actually I waited 39 years until Chelsea Manning revealed as

305
00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.980
a comparable amount. I was very happy when that happened. And then it,

306
00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:08.810
the Snowden three years later, I identify with them very much,

307
00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.080
but why did it take almost 40 years? W why no others.

308
00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:16.190
<v 0>But even, even, even if there was a mistrial, uh, and you,</v>

309
00:19:16.191 --> 00:19:19.850
you did not have to go to prison. Did you pay a price anyway?

310
00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:25.100
<v 1>Well, not what Nixon him had in mind for me, uh, you know,</v>

311
00:19:25.101 --> 00:19:29.750
which was life, life in prison, which I expected, uh, and what I didn't expect.

312
00:19:29.751 --> 00:19:34.340
He also had in mind shutting me up about his threats and sent, uh,

313
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:35.061
for example,

314
00:19:35.061 --> 00:19:39.590
a dozen people to incapacitate me totally on the steps of the Capitol.

315
00:19:39.591 --> 00:19:44.180
When I was going to rally on May 3rd, 1972, I hadn't expected that,

316
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:48.620
uh, he listened to me, uh, have the CIA on me and various things,

317
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:53.600
but none of these worked, uh, he, he had bad luck on this,

318
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:57.380
which led him to face resignation. And, uh,

319
00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:00.800
I sh I shouldn't say led him to face impeachment and prosecution.

320
00:20:00.801 --> 00:20:03.800
And so he had to resign and it made the war in double,

321
00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:08.120
but a lot of people had to tell proves they weren't expected to tell at that

322
00:20:08.121 --> 00:20:11.750
point, Alex Butterfield had to reveal that the taping,

323
00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:16.160
without which John Dean's revolutions without any proof would not have been

324
00:20:16.161 --> 00:20:19.040
effective, uh, Richardson the special, uh,

325
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.890
had to refuse to fire the special prosecutor,

326
00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.630
which an issue that may come up any day or any month now in the current

327
00:20:26.631 --> 00:20:27.464
administration.

328
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:31.090
<v 0>But did you lose friends? Did they lose friends?</v>

329
00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:35.150
<v 1>Uh, I lost all my friends because they all had clearances friends.</v>

330
00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:37.010
Who've known me more than a couple of years.

331
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:41.690
Very fortunately I had wonderful new friends like Howard Zinn, Noam, Chomsky,

332
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:46.280
various others that have remained until Howard's death. I was just the gnomes,

333
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:50.650
a 90th birthday party, uh, about a month ago. And, uh,

334
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.170
so I had wonderful friends,

335
00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:57.190
but no one who'd known me before I was about 40, uh,

336
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.630
the old dropped away because they couldn't afford to be in the same room.

337
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:04.630
I become radioactive in effect in terms of their own clearances.

338
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:10.090
So that's why I, uh, I identify so much with Chelsea Manning and Snowden.

339
00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.290
They've had the same experience.

340
00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:16.110
<v 0>Or we, we wrap up here. Um, I have to ask you about,</v>

341
00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:17.243
because I read,

342
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:22.020
I have to go back to your very early days because you

343
00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:26.430
experienced the tragedy in your very early life. Uh,

344
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.100
and I wonder in what way that shaped you.

345
00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:34.740
<v 1>Well at the time, you know, earlier on, I would not have said so,</v>

346
00:21:34.741 --> 00:21:36.360
but looking back at my life,

347
00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:42.030
I realized that my father fell asleep at the wheel of a car and crashed into a

348
00:21:42.031 --> 00:21:44.640
culvert, which killed my mother and sister.

349
00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.060
I was in the hospital for three and a half months with how old were you?

350
00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:52.980
I was 15 then, and my sister was 14. Uh,

351
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.360
that did reveal to me looking back on it, uh,

352
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.530
that the world could change very suddenly.

353
00:22:01.531 --> 00:22:05.070
I think I'm more open to the knowledge,

354
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.960
the truth that our world could be destroyed very quickly.

355
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.870
It's very hard for other people to even imagine that I think,

356
00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:18.120
and also that it could happen as a result of an authority that I trusted

357
00:22:18.121 --> 00:22:22.770
and loved my father falling, asleep, being inattentive,

358
00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:27.000
and the one had to be vigilant to some extent in a way that I hadn't been,

359
00:22:27.001 --> 00:22:31.110
or couldn't be to keep them awake. I think that did have an effect on me.

360
00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:33.330
Uh, you know, I was,

361
00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:37.740
I'm very honored here to be sitting in the same chair that, uh,

362
00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:43.020
Greta Twinburg occupied or my new hero.

363
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.310
And, uh, I, there's no one on earth that I admire, uh,

364
00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.070
more than Greta at this point. And, uh,

365
00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:54.900
I was struck that you asked her a similar question about her Asperger's, uh,

366
00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:59.340
disease autism. And if she's right in what she told you,

367
00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:04.920
that her background and her character Asperger's had contributed

368
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:07.620
to her perspective and her courage and whatnot,

369
00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:12.570
then we need a lot more Asperger's in the world. I would say

370
00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:21.450
[inaudible] is a walking advertisement for Asperger's or autism,

371
00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.000
and really our survival.

372
00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:25.560
<v 0>Yeah. The similarities between what you.</v>

373
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.580
<v 1>In my own, each of us may have had in our own background,</v>

374
00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:34.020
Chelsea Manning had a very strange and tortured background in many ways,

375
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:39.270
which I'm sure revealed her to the fact that people can be

376
00:23:39.271 --> 00:23:44.010
mistaken. And they're very broad. The scale can be asleep in what they're doing.

377
00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.950
It's what I have the same is I was listening to her. I loved that program, uh,

378
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:52.370
which I watched at midnight, listening. Your assistant sent me links,

379
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:57.350
and I've never been so impressed that I was so excited that I, in my mind,

380
00:23:57.351 --> 00:24:00.320
I reverted back to my old Marine Corps language.

381
00:24:00.321 --> 00:24:02.750
And I wrote to him in credible.

382
00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.700
<v 0>[Inaudible]. I was never, I was never in my reading, Danielle,</v>

383
00:24:12.701 --> 00:24:17.140
but I will say it still say to meet you while I was in credible.

384
00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:20.230
[inaudible]. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you. I

385
00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:25.540
hope you enjoyed the clip for more interesting conversations.
