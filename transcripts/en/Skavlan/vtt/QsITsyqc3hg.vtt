00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>Michael McIntyre. Welcome.</v>

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.850
<v 1>Hey, Hey. Hi. Hi Fred. I'm wearing the same suit.</v>

3
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.680
I'm wearing the same suit as the Netflix special ed. I'm so sorry. I forgot.

4
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.580
It's so rare that I've left the house for the last six months.

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.620
It was so exciting to wear a suit and he possessed one outfit.

6
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.950
<v 0>Or is that the only one that actually fits you these days?</v>

7
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.370
<v 1>My, it doesn't fit me. I can't even do it up anymore, so it's getting worse,</v>

8
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.080
but no, yeah, that that's true. Now I've decided sitting is, is more difficult.

9
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:36.321
Yes,

10
00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:40.340
but I do have other clothes that I think it's important that everybody remembers

11
00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:44.480
that. Um, so you are in Norway. Whereabouts in Norway, are you Frederick.

12
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.940
<v 0>Slow with a young Thomas is a famous stylist and a in Oslo.</v>

13
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.133
I knew you would.

14
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.970
<v 1>Thomas, how would you style me? What's lacking here.</v>

15
00:00:55.971 --> 00:00:58.400
What do you think? Well.

16
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.850
<v 0>Let's, let's go on a little shopping spree.</v>

17
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.840
<v 1>When, when we can travel again, I'll come to London and we'll go shopping. Well,</v>

18
00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:08.120
this is [inaudible],

19
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.150
That's the only thing I have in my diary at the moment.

20
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.710
So thank you so much for that.

21
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.010
<v 0>We also, we also have sweetened with us with the, uh,</v>

22
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.960
ex ex uh, leader of the labor party in Sweden, uh,

23
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.350
mano saline and a fellow non-Indian David ballpark.

24
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.550
<v 1>Hi, David Mona. Very good. Thank you.</v>

25
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.650
What's an extraordinary moment in circumstances to meet you in Sweden. Um,

26
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:40.600
this might be the,

27
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.460
I'm going to confidently say this is probably the only time we'll ever meet.

28
00:01:43.461 --> 00:01:47.090
I mean, that's no disrespect, but I see all paths crossing again.

29
00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:51.350
So let's make the most of this guys, I think, is it.

30
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.980
<v 0>Tell me, are you, I mean, your show is called Shonan,</v>

31
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.360
are you a, obviously you are a show, man. We can see that from the,

32
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.770
from the clips of the, uh, of the show, but, but, but,

33
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.080
but are you a showman at all times,

34
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.040
or do you have moments where you just don't want to be a show? Man?

35
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.680
<v 1>I am not. Listen. I didn't want to be a show band when, uh,</v>

36
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.500
when all this started at the beginning of, uh,

37
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.210
at the beginning of the pandemic, it marked when it, when we went into lockdown,

38
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.310
um, which is amazing because I recorded this show a week before. So this was,

39
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.450
you know, this is a record of the lights, the last performance I ever did.

40
00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:35.000
It's the last time I was an official showman.

41
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.050
And then a few weeks later we'll know I wasn't Frederick. I was, uh,

42
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.090
I was a Baker and a hairdresser and a teacher and all the things we had to

43
00:02:44.091 --> 00:02:46.280
do at home. Um,

44
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.160
it was just amazing to have the rug pulled out from under,

45
00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:53.180
like we all have across the world. Um, um, from,

46
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.770
from beneath you and suddenly have to, you know, re readjust because I,

47
00:02:57.771 --> 00:02:59.650
you know, my family have no respect for me.

48
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:03.820
I have noticed that I'm not a comedy star in their eyes,

49
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.660
especially my teenage sons. I'm a very annoying person.

50
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.890
I've only done this Netflix thing to try and appear cool to them in some way.

51
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.790
Um, and that's not working anyway. They're watching other things on Netflix,

52
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.530
even though I'm now on Netflix. Um, but now, now I'm coming out of it.

53
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.670
I'm out of the house.

54
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.270
I've got the suit back on and you're helping me feel like a show, man,

55
00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:26.104
all over again.

56
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.323
<v 0>Hi. Hi.</v>

57
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.193
[inaudible].

58
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.180
<v 1>Just the moments you're at all times to make sure that I'm healthy. So.</v>

59
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:42.060
<v 0>It's.</v>

60
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.100
<v 1>Very, very low. I don't know if it's broken.</v>

61
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.303
<v 0>It's fine.</v>

62
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.210
<v 1>No, I'm fine. I'm absolutely.</v>

63
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.680
<v 0>Fine. But do they have these.</v>

64
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.470
<v 1>Frederick? Do they have these annoying?</v>

65
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.230
<v 0>Yes. Yes. We have them.</v>

66
00:03:58.231 --> 00:04:01.260
I think we use them to cure asthma.

67
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.630
<v 1>This is a thermometer. And when you go to a restaurant in London, they,</v>

68
00:04:06.631 --> 00:04:09.540
they shoot you like this to make sure that you're allowed it and you don't have

69
00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:12.780
a temperature. And they do. My whole family went out for lunch today.

70
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.530
Every single one of us was the right temperature. Then I ordered chicken.

71
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.620
They under cooked. It we've shown up at the right temperature.

72
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.050
The least they can do is get the chicken at the right temperature.

73
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.130
I want to talk to you about the Norwegian language.

74
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.320
I was on the front page of a Norwegian newspaper when I announced some shows in,

75
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.880
in Bergen. Bergen. Yeah, that's perfect.

76
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.670
<v 0>But that again, bad again.</v>

77
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.550
<v 1>So I said a completely different word Bergen, but it's bad again,</v>

78
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.630
bad again for me is when something buy something at a good price.

79
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.800
So I went to the bathroom where apparently it's the rainiest place in the world.

80
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.570
This is the, this is right. You know this?

81
00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.520
<v 0>Yeah, it's quite wet there. Yeah.</v>

82
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.200
<v 1>I got in the taxi in the airport and the guy had his windscreen wipers on,</v>

83
00:05:04.201 --> 00:05:06.930
but it wasn't raining. So it was making a massive, annoying noise, you know?

84
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.360
And I said, excuse me, it's not raining. And he just turned around to win.

85
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.990
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

86
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.540
<v 1>They had me on the front page and it said I was the humor.</v>

87
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.500
<v 0>What does that? The King of humor.</v>

88
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.223
It's so bad.

89
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.280
<v 1>And when my children disrespect me, I go, how dare you say that to the human.</v>

90
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.920
<v 0>It sounds impressive. I agree. Yeah. I'm still fine. It's still fine.</v>

91
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.520
<v 1>I love Norway. Norway has been so good for me and I love Sweden. I did,</v>

92
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.290
but Norway prefer me. So I, I, I, I,

93
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.850
I need to build my presence in Sweden, but no, I did a gig in Stockholm,

94
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.770
but in Norway I've been to Oslo and Stavanger and,

95
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.080
um, Christian sand and Bergen and throne time

96
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.480
in Trump time, I came out of the airport. It, you know,

97
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:19.640
the revolving door and I came,

98
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:24.320
it was so icy that I slipped under the car that was picking me up and

99
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:25.154
nobody knew what.

100
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.240
<v 0>Everyone was like, going Miko. Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey,</v>

101
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.100
I was under the car screaming,

102
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.920
but tell me apart from, apart from Scandinavia.

103
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.800
Yeah. Fantastic. Yes.

104
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.640
That's some place as well. So cold, so cold.

105
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.960
<v 1>There's just a ski jump and everyone's just, it's crazy place.</v>

106
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.290
Crazy know interrupting you.

107
00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.390
<v 0>No, my question was, I mean, if we're talking about touring,</v>

108
00:07:01.391 --> 00:07:03.310
which is a, which is, uh,

109
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.340
might be a possibility again in the future and what, what, what,

110
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:12.250
what would be your favorite continent to tour apart from

111
00:07:12.251 --> 00:07:13.084
Scandinavia?

112
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.110
<v 1>There is nowhere else. Scandinavia</v>

113
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.710
is my favorite continent.

114
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.830
<v 0>Because you're moving all over the road. No.</v>

115
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.760
<v 1>I love, I love Scandinavia. I love the people I love.</v>

116
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.520
They love their English is incredible.

117
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.910
The first show I ever did in Oslo,

118
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:38.620
I w I slowed everything down and I needed actually to speed it up. You know,

119
00:07:38.621 --> 00:07:41.350
I was talking slowly because it's not your first language,

120
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:46.330
but the standard of English in Norway is far superior than

121
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.420
anything I've experienced in England.

122
00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.820
<v 0>But, but tell me, how have you, uh, I mean, your wife, you, you,</v>

123
00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:01.720
you, you talk a lot about your wife and your kids.

124
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.620
Are they always okay with that? Or does it happen that they get annoyed?

125
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.620
<v 1>Um, my boys, not so much, they don't get to know it because I, I always, um,</v>

126
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.170
I sort of hide it from them a little bit and that they, you know,

127
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:18.610
they're at that age where they don't think their dad is cool. I mean,

128
00:08:18.611 --> 00:08:21.940
I don't know if you've got kids, how old they are, but it gets to the point.

129
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.630
Like, I, I used to drive my son to school and it's not so far away.

130
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:29.500
This school we could walk, but he always wanted me to drive him. Um, nah,

131
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:33.970
the other day we got into the car, I hadn't even turned the car on and he said,

132
00:08:33.971 --> 00:08:35.770
dad, can you just drop me off here?

133
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.790
And we hadn't even gone anywhere because he's so embarrassed to be with me

134
00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:42.880
anymore. So they are in no way, um,

135
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.520
watching everything I do so I can get away with a lot, I think.

136
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.290
And also the jokes I have about them is when they were much younger.

137
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.080
So they're not really that person anymore, if that makes sense,

138
00:08:53.081 --> 00:08:56.370
because they were toddlers. And you know, I've got about when they were babies,

139
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.800
but my, my wife has a slightly different story.

140
00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:03.630
She's had to put up with quite a lot. So I've made all sorts of jokes. Um,

141
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.670
I mean a big one I had was her putting tights on. And I talked about, you know,

142
00:09:08.671 --> 00:09:09.750
when you get the tights,

143
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:14.640
how the beginning bit is quite sexy when you put the tight on the lower leg and

144
00:09:14.641 --> 00:09:16.780
you know, when do you have tights? Is that a thing? Or.

145
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:22.070
<v 0>W w I don't wear them. I don't, but I know of it. Yes.</v>

146
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.740
<v 1>It was putting our tights on one day when she was, you know,</v>

147
00:09:24.741 --> 00:09:28.100
hiking it all up and putting them all out like that. And I said,

148
00:09:28.101 --> 00:09:30.890
that is very funny, darling. I might make jokes about that. And she said,

149
00:09:30.891 --> 00:09:34.250
I don't think any other woman does that. Well, it turns out they all do it.

150
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.960
And that became one of my biggest jokes.

151
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:40.700
And always people come up to us and say, Oh, you're the one with the tights.

152
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.480
And I did make jokes, which I regret about her farting in her sleep,

153
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:48.140
which wasn't even true. And that was when I maybe maybe pushed the,

154
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:49.303
pushed it too far.

155
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:54.080
<v 0>How, how did, how did he meet your wife? She was.</v>

156
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.550
<v 1>Um,</v>

157
00:09:55.550 --> 00:10:00.230
she was a friend of my sisters and I

158
00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:04.300
met her when I was an aspiring, what I thought I was a writer.

159
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.580
I tried to be a writer. I wrote a screenplay. Uh,

160
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.750
it was a comedy film before I had the guts to go on stage.

161
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.230
And she was an aspiring actress and it's quite romantic really.

162
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:19.280
Cause I wrote a film about a love story, like a romantic comedy.

163
00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:24.620
And my sister said, I think I've met the exact girl from the film you wrote.

164
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:29.210
So I sort of like created her. So we had a meeting about a big in this film.

165
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:34.280
Um, and she was literally the girl of my dreams. So, uh, yeah. Um,

166
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:38.900
a few years of begging and persuading and hiding in her garden later.

167
00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:44.630
Um, and brushing my hair in front of my face and taking my glasses off. Um,

168
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.330
we got together and we'd been together for 20 years. Yeah.

169
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.290
So it's going really well.

170
00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:00.050
<v 0>[Inaudible] so she got together with her stalker. That's what happened? Yes.</v>

171
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:01.100
That's exactly right.

172
00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.380
<v 1>That's exactly what happened. I,</v>

173
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.500
it was one of the biggest shocks of my life when she said,

174
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.440
I think I'm falling in love with you because I thought she was about to call the

175
00:11:09.441 --> 00:11:13.100
police again. It was extraordinary. Yeah.

176
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:15.950
<v 0>Uh, tell me, how have you been touring in India as well?</v>

177
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.030
<v 1>India? No. No, I'm never in India. No.</v>

178
00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:23.030
<v 0>So you never, you never,</v>

179
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.870
you never dared to try India in there as too big for you or

180
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:31.850
why David has toured India. Yeah.

181
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.860
<v 1>Please, please. Don't try. It were enough people there already.</v>

182
00:11:36.861 --> 00:11:40.940
I'm not welcome in India. No, no.

183
00:11:40.941 --> 00:11:44.930
I've heard there was some gigs in India. I think in Delhi that people

184
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.930
in the UK were doing. Um, they never returned. So I don't know.

185
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:55.750
No, but would love to, I would love to, I would love to get an idea. Um,

186
00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:00.250
you know, if they'll have me, it tends to be where people, you know,

187
00:12:00.251 --> 00:12:03.790
invite me in. And then I find out that I might have an audience there.

188
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.740
And on occasion I find out that I don't.

189
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.020
<v 0>What, what, David, what would be your advice to,</v>

190
00:12:09.021 --> 00:12:11.520
to Michael if he were to tour in India? What,

191
00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.950
what is important to think about that?

192
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.470
<v 2>Well, when I go up into stage in Delhi people, yes,</v>

193
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:26.183
[inaudible], [inaudible].

194
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.730
<v 1>Listen. When the pandemic's over David,</v>

195
00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:35.040
we're going to wrestle to find out who is this?

196
00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:43.680
<v 2>No, no, my advisor,</v>

197
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.520
I haven't spent a half year now trying to pitch my show.

198
00:12:47.521 --> 00:12:51.150
That's the name is the world's worst Indian in India.

199
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:56.370
So one piece of advice, don't name anything about worst Indian state?

200
00:12:56.371 --> 00:12:57.204
They don't like that.

201
00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.300
<v 1>No, I won't do that. This and all this advice is great.</v>

202
00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.010
And I'd love to do a gig.

203
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:06.810
<v 0>Anywhere, um, right now. But, but, but when you say that, I mean,</v>

204
00:13:06.811 --> 00:13:10.620
do you have to adapt to the culture in a way? Do you do, is it,

205
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.570
is it a big difference where you tour?

206
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.110
<v 1>Well, that's it that, that helps really, because, you know,</v>

207
00:13:16.111 --> 00:13:20.010
I've lived in London my whole life and I have very few jokes about London,

208
00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:22.110
but when you go to a new place,

209
00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.590
you immediately see the differences and can just talk about them.

210
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.980
And they're just, they're just funny naturally. Um,

211
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:33.210
and they appreciate that you're paying attention. So actually it's much easier.

212
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.250
Um, I mean, I did, yeah.

213
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.970
I traveled around the whole world and then I ended up back doing these huge gigs

214
00:13:38.971 --> 00:13:42.420
in London and I realized I didn't really have anything to start with because I

215
00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:46.740
normally just start with, you know, um, local stuff, you know,

216
00:13:46.741 --> 00:13:50.400
from where I am. Um, so, so yeah, no, that's,

217
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:54.540
that's a real benefit of, uh, of gig of performing around the world.

218
00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:59.550
<v 0>I think a typical fan, I don't know where,</v>

219
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.810
w what's your typical fan in Scandinavia, but I know of one and that's more now,

220
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.810
uh, more than a year, a big Michael fan.

221
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.150
And I'm going to let you ask him a question. Now, if you have.

222
00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:14.270
<v 2>I want to be the unexpected star of the show.</v>

223
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.380
This is so exciting.

224
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:25.290
<v 1>Absolutely. Well, the problem is Muna is that now you know about it.</v>

225
00:14:25.291 --> 00:14:28.890
So I'm going to have to say that you won't be, but that, that means you will,

226
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.250
the unexpected, it needs to be, it needs to be expecting.

227
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:35.070
The last thing I can have, the unexpected star of the show is,

228
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:39.380
is expecting to be the unexpected stuff. So that's great that you,

229
00:14:39.381 --> 00:14:41.850
you watch that show in Sweden. Yeah.

230
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.210
<v 0>Can you please, can you please explain this more now? This is,</v>

231
00:14:45.211 --> 00:14:49.830
this is your business. Spend a lot of time with Michael. So explain this.

232
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.130
No, I, I sit alone.

233
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.580
<v 1>In my home and I put on breath, BBC Brit.</v>

234
00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:00.590
And there he is. So every time when I'm feeling sad and lonely,

235
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.010
then Micah comes to say, you are the unexpected star.

236
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:10.370
So this is excellent. Well, I'm so thrilled. Yes. This is my TV show.

237
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:14.450
And I'm just finding out in this in real time that maybe the rights to that show

238
00:15:14.451 --> 00:15:19.370
was shot sold to Sweden and maybe not Norway. So if you,

239
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:22.700
do you have them, do you have my show in Norway?

240
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.410
But you have the British and the BBC.

241
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:29.200
<v 0>Yeah. We have to see it through all the channels. They were not having it. No.</v>

242
00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.630
<v 1>Because I remember asking people in Norway,</v>

243
00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:36.340
what they watched from Britain and they watched like really old shows like

244
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.050
Bertia rack. Do you remember?

245
00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:39.700
<v 0>We love,</v>

246
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:44.080
we love Virgin Bergerac is very much here and now for us.

247
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.490
<v 1>Frederick, I mean, buzzer act was like from the seventies. I mean.</v>

248
00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.630
<v 0>So, so relevant. It's so relevant.</v>

249
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.830
<v 1>So what, what shows do you watch? And everyone was just like.</v>

250
00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.171
<v 0>No,</v>

251
00:15:59.171 --> 00:16:04.090
but we also have this pimple popping show that [inaudible] is

252
00:16:04.091 --> 00:16:06.790
about Dr. Pimple popper.

253
00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:11.860
<v 1>Yes. I, my, my boys have watched this on YouTube. Um,</v>

254
00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:16.000
and so I would never watch this. This is a terrible, and they,

255
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.390
this pimple popping. Yes.

256
00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:25.810
I, I don't know why it's successful. Um, because the,

257
00:16:25.811 --> 00:16:28.930
the first time I went to Norway, they were those guys that did the Fox song.

258
00:16:28.931 --> 00:16:30.100
Do you remember that one? What does it.

259
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.820
<v 0>Yes. Yes. David has been working with them. Yeah.</v>

260
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.850
<v 1>Yes. And, and everyone was crazy. I thought, no,</v>

261
00:16:36.851 --> 00:16:39.100
it was one of the wildest places I'd ever been.

262
00:16:39.101 --> 00:16:40.630
It was just people going budget act

263
00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:46.810
done. So this is why I love you guys.

264
00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.920
<v 0>Tell me, uh, w if and when you're,</v>

265
00:16:50.921 --> 00:16:54.910
you're you're going on tour again, or do you, do you stay,

266
00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:59.140
do you stay fit? Do you stay stage ready at all times?

267
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.460
<v 1>Uh, no. No, no, no. I mean,</v>

268
00:17:03.461 --> 00:17:07.840
there's a short answer to that and it's no, the thing is, I always,

269
00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:12.760
it's only when I'm on stage, I get so much energy. I'm very physical on stage,

270
00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:16.600
but outside, outside of the stage, I mean, nothing really,

271
00:17:16.601 --> 00:17:20.080
nothing even just to get to the stage, is it effort? Um,

272
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:21.730
but then as soon as I'm on the stage,

273
00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:25.660
and that's why I injured myself all the time, because I do things in my buddies,

274
00:17:25.661 --> 00:17:29.470
like, what are we doing? We don't do this. So I've literally I've hurt my arm.

275
00:17:29.471 --> 00:17:33.490
I dislocated my shoulder on stage. I pulled muscles in my back and my leg.

276
00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:37.120
I'm always injured. And I'm always wearing those heat patches, you know,

277
00:17:37.121 --> 00:17:41.740
to try and get myself feel better. I need to get fit. We need to go shopping.

278
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.350
I need to get fit. This is all a plan.

279
00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:49.260
<v 0>So, but, but D D do you have any kind of pressure to, to,</v>

280
00:17:49.261 --> 00:17:52.320
to, to stay sort of, I mean,

281
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:55.500
we were talking about the looks of the autonomous area. I, we can agree.

282
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.423
He looks good.

283
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:59.750
<v 1>John Thomas is one of the most attractive men I've ever seen in my life. Ah,</v>

284
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:03.620
young Thomas danger. He's dangerous. Thank God.

285
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.140
We're separated by this huge distance.

286
00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.990
My wife would be aware in a flash for young Thomas.

287
00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.660
These teeth are so perfectly white. I was looking for sunglasses.

288
00:18:14.661 --> 00:18:17.690
I could barely dazzled by young Thomas,

289
00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:23.300
not quite as attractive.

290
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:29.180
I don't think you want to be sitting next to young Thomas.

291
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.420
You need to be sitting to me and then you'll look amazing.

292
00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.100
<v 0>I, I I'll keep the social distance for many reasons.</v>

293
00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:39.590
<v 1>Yes. You'd need to socially distance to be a.</v>

294
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:44.480
And then you might get a bit more excitement, but listen, DNS, Frederick.

295
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:45.950
I saw that you've got an audience.

296
00:18:45.951 --> 00:18:48.740
They're all sitting together and they looked at me.

297
00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.230
<v 0>Yeah. In groups, in small groups, you know, they've had family groups, um, with,</v>

298
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:55.910
with distance between the groups.

299
00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.550
<v 1>They're all in one family,</v>

300
00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.900
many, many small groups. I saw them.

301
00:19:08.901 --> 00:19:10.520
They all sat with sitting in lines.

302
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.310
Did you advertise for the biggest family in Norway?

303
00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:19.850
They're all Mormons. Well,

304
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:23.390
they must be nice to hear laughter I don't, I don't get to hear that anybody.

305
00:19:23.391 --> 00:19:26.650
I mean, I can hear it a bit now, which is really thrilling. Please,

306
00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:27.920
please enjoy it. Tell me.

307
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:28.871
<v 0>Uh, I,</v>

308
00:19:28.871 --> 00:19:33.680
I read in some interview or something that your wife wants to send you to a

309
00:19:33.681 --> 00:19:37.970
health farm just to shape and get

310
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:41.540
lose weight. What was that like? Did that work?

311
00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.640
<v 1>Well, I think, you know the answer because you can see me,</v>

312
00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:52.280
but, um, it did work actually, but then I did put the weight back on.

313
00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:56.660
It was an inquiry. She basically said go away and come back, better looking.

314
00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.440
So she sent me to Austria and um,

315
00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:05.450
I lost a stone now. I don't know what to stone is in. What do you have?

316
00:20:05.451 --> 00:20:06.284
Kilogram?

317
00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.040
<v 0>It's a lot. That's that's quite much. That's that's okay.</v>

318
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:11.930
How long did that take?

319
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:16.040
<v 1>Only a week. It was only a week and it costs lots and lots of money,</v>

320
00:20:16.041 --> 00:20:19.010
but it's amazing what they do. Oh, I can tell you how they do it.

321
00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.520
It's incredible. They don't give you any food.

322
00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.910
They literally just don't give you food. It's just full of my, you know,

323
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.260
when your tummy is chat, you know,

324
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:33.230
when your tummy you're hungry and your tummy rumbles, you know, when you're,

325
00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:35.270
sometimes you're in bed and you hear it or,

326
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:42.230
you know, sometimes you comment on it. The whole of this whole everyone's,

327
00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:45.020
it was like Jurassic park. Everybody was just

328
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:51.430
everyone's Tommy's was so hungry. And of course you lose weight.

329
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.070
So I lost a lot of weight and I nanny took legal action. I mean,

330
00:20:57.071 --> 00:21:00.580
it was like a prison, but I did live pretty good for a bit.

331
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.010
I think you look great too. Thank you very much, Michael.
