00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:04.860
<v 0>[Inaudible] professor Thomas Piketty.</v>

2
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.190
[inaudible] I wish I could do this in French.

3
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.770
<v 1>I wish I could do it in Swedish.</v>

4
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.270
<v 0>Well,</v>

5
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.770
the thing is I can barely order order a glass of wine and let alone talk about

6
00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:36.750
the economy in French. It says we shouldn't even try, uh, how is it for you to,

7
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.580
to be compared with Karl Marx?

8
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.730
<v 1>Well, no, I have no, I have no problem with the publicity around the book.</v>

9
00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:47.000
As long as it gets more people to read the book, you know, this is fine,

10
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.650
this is fine with me. Uh, so look, this is a very different kind of book.

11
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.340
You know, this was written in 2014, 2013.

12
00:00:55.341 --> 00:00:59.990
Mark's book was written in 1867. So this is a different world. So this is,

13
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.670
this has little to do. My book is more a book about the history of capitalism,

14
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.530
which is a bit different with what the [inaudible] or marks or other 19th

15
00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:12.170
century economies could do because they had very little data.

16
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.880
So there is a where mostly, you know, theoretical speculation. Whereas my,

17
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.010
my work, I think, you know, if it was, uh,

18
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.990
successful is because for the first time it contains a lot of historical

19
00:01:23.991 --> 00:01:27.560
evidence on an issue, which everybody cares about,

20
00:01:27.561 --> 00:01:31.130
which is money and inequality. And, and, you know,

21
00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:36.010
this has consequences for the life of peoples life of people who go on strike

22
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.830
as the life of people. You know, when they get married, when they divorced,

23
00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:40.664
when, you know,

24
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.840
he says as consequences that are important in everyone's life,

25
00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:46.640
and this is this theory of money.

26
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.130
<v 0>Let's start, let's start at the very top, uh,</v>

27
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.680
based on these data and based on the facts who, who owns the world today.

28
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.220
<v 1>Well, if you let, if you look at the word level, it is true that today,</v>

29
00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:01.651
you know, the,

30
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:06.230
the estimate we have is that the top 1% whence

31
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.730
olders in the world will own around Alf of the world's total Wells.

32
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.870
And the bottom 50% would own a, you know, less than 5%,

33
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.960
probably less than 2%, 1%. Now, of course,

34
00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:21.590
that's also due to the fact that you have very large international inequalities

35
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.930
between countries. If you look within countries, it's a bit less extreme, uh,

36
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.330
and it used to be even more unequal. You know,

37
00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:34.230
you take a country like Sweden or France a century ago. Uh, the,

38
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.440
the top 1% of the population would own over 60% of

39
00:02:39.441 --> 00:02:40.274
total wealth.

40
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.080
And one of the major discovery in my book is that it really took major

41
00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:47.780
shocks world war one, world war two,

42
00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:52.370
the great depression and the new social democratic policies or

43
00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:57.170
new social and fiscal compromise that were adopted after the

44
00:02:57.171 --> 00:03:02.140
sharks. And in particular after world war to finally have a more

45
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:05.680
equitable distribution of income and wealth. Now in recent decades,

46
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.680
starting around the 1980s and 1990s,

47
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.210
we have a new tendency to rising concentration.

48
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.610
We are not back yet to the level of concentration we had a century ago

49
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:21.370
in European countries, but the research,

50
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.830
a question which I think many people are asking is, you know,

51
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.100
is the middle class share in total wealth?

52
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.100
Is that going to shrink in the future? Is it going to expand?

53
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:31.990
Are we going to have a bigger and bigger middle class?

54
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.130
And these are very important questions and they answer,

55
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.730
and the answer is nobody knows, you know,

56
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:41.860
this depends on the policies that we choose.

57
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.210
Probably the main conclusion of my book is that, you know, unlike marks or,

58
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.700
or Kuznets in the 20th century,

59
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:52.990
I don't believe in deterministic economy clothes. I think it's the end.

60
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:57.610
It all depends on the, the policies that we choose. But if we don't have,

61
00:03:57.611 --> 00:03:59.620
for instance, more fiscal coordination,

62
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.780
if we keep Irving competition between countries to attract companies

63
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:07.690
to attract, uh, I well, so I skilled individuals.

64
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.880
There's a risk in particular in Europe where we keep reducing,

65
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.610
uh, like for instance, corporate tax. You know, you remember as a recent, uh,

66
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.320
uh, look, Sean block leaks,

67
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.110
a scandal where we learned in Europe that the largest multinational companies

68
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.690
were not even paying the statutory tax rate of 10% for under profits.

69
00:04:28.691 --> 00:04:32.740
It looks on books, they were paying 1%, 2%, so that in the end,

70
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.610
our small and medium size companies are paying higher,

71
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:39.400
effective tax rate than the largest company.

72
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:41.440
So now if we keep going in this direction,

73
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.180
I think there's a serious risk is the middle class feels that they are paying

74
00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:50.530
more than the very rich and medium-sized companies most.

75
00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:55.150
And the very large multi-national that our basic social contract, you know,

76
00:04:55.151 --> 00:05:00.070
will be under stress because there's a risk that rising inequality in, in,

77
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:03.400
in Europe, if this continues can take proportions,

78
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.050
which are in complete contradiction, we are with our basic democratic.

79
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.020
<v 0>Yeah. So in a way, we're moving, moving toward,</v>

80
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.990
back towards this Downton Abbey society where the rich are the few

81
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.163
that.

82
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.040
<v 1>From there, you know, and I have, no, my book is not a pessimistic book.</v>

83
00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:27.540
I think there are ways to regulate this, but this is a risk that we should,

84
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.250
we should, uh, we should assess.

85
00:05:29.251 --> 00:05:34.140
I think it will be a mistake just to rely on natural forces, uh, to,

86
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.070
to, uh, to solve this problem. And so we have to be careful.

87
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.820
<v 0>And when, when you talk about the 1%, uh,</v>

88
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.420
the Richards, rich richest people in the world, in a way,

89
00:05:45.421 --> 00:05:50.370
the 1% riches owning almost half the, the, the world,

90
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.380
uh, that, that that's being hammered.

91
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.010
<v 2>Yeah. Those that would be the.</v>

92
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.750
<v 1>Top 1% in Norway also tubs 0.1% in Norway is the top 1% in the</v>

93
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:05.870
world. It's a lot of people because the world is, it's a big planet,

94
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.100
that's 7 billion people. So, you know, eh, you know,

95
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.350
one person is seven 70 million people. So it's a big group.

96
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.830
So it's much more of a new, but if you, if you take, if you take it away.

97
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.460
<v 0>So how, how much money do you,</v>

98
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.100
do you need to have to be among the top 1% in the world.

99
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.590
<v 1>Or in terms of wealth, uh, you know, above, uh, above 1 million,</v>

100
00:06:26.591 --> 00:06:28.570
a million dollar in net Wells, you will be.

101
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.760
<v 0>That's it, that's it the truth. I never felt her part, or</v>

102
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.670
I don't remember our slogan is affordable fares and everyone. So I'm sorry.

103
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.520
<v 1>Nope. There's no problem with having some rich peoples and poor people.</v>

104
00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:50.140
Some middle people, as long as inequality remains within reasonable limits.

105
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.860
And as long as the different groups in societies, uh,

106
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.880
benefit from growth and globalization at comparable speed,

107
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:03.280
the problem is when the top wealth groups are rising, uh,

108
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.640
three, four times faster than the size of the economy,

109
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.760
you can see that you have a problem, you know? Yeah,

110
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.270
you cannot continue forever. At some point, we'll have to stop,

111
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:18.040
and this will stop somewhere now where we need stop with what level of

112
00:07:18.041 --> 00:07:21.700
concentration of income and wealth. Nobody knows. So, you know,

113
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.090
there's no pilot in the plane, it's, uh, we, we need to,

114
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:29.710
we need to put a collective regulation on this. So I think we need,

115
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.610
I believe in market forces in globalization, in an open economy,

116
00:07:33.611 --> 00:07:35.320
but I think we need at the same time,

117
00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:39.850
strong democratic institutions to ensure that these powerful

118
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:44.230
forces are put in the right direction and that brought groups in the population

119
00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:46.990
can benefit otherwise. Uh, you know,

120
00:07:46.991 --> 00:07:51.430
there's a risk that if large groups in the population feel that globalization

121
00:07:51.431 --> 00:07:55.810
does not work for them, that they will turn for nationalist solutions,

122
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:56.890
that they will turn. And, you know,

123
00:07:56.891 --> 00:08:00.190
speaking from France with the rise of the extreme, right. Uh,

124
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.610
this is a very serious concern. And I understand that in Sweden,

125
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.400
this is a concern as well. And I think generally speaking,

126
00:08:06.401 --> 00:08:10.840
we have to make sure that globalization benefits, not only to a small group,

127
00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.330
but to, to very broad groups of the population.

128
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.420
And this is possible if we adopt the right policies,

129
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:17.980
but this is not what we are doing now.

130
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:23.070
<v 0>But let's see. I mean, now you're in this Norwegian Swedish, uh, talk show, uh,</v>

131
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.750
and let's use Norway and Sweden just as an example, because Norway is, is,

132
00:08:27.751 --> 00:08:31.750
is really, I mean, it's, it's, it's all about return of investment. It's,

133
00:08:31.751 --> 00:08:36.400
it's living from this huge fund, uh, and, and Sweden is not.

134
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:37.840
So would it be,

135
00:08:37.841 --> 00:08:41.530
would it be fair to say that it can be an illustration of your point?

136
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.130
<v 1>Yeah, it's a very particular situation.</v>

137
00:08:45.131 --> 00:08:48.460
You're not Norway and Sweden are among the richest countries in the world.

138
00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:51.970
And these are also among the most egalitarian countries in the world.

139
00:08:51.971 --> 00:08:55.320
Although inequality has increased substantially in a country like Sweden the

140
00:08:55.321 --> 00:08:56.350
past 20 years, you know,

141
00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.690
it is still as compared to the us or as compared to a number of other European

142
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:01.440
countries.

143
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:06.060
These are still pretty egalitarian society where the social model is working

144
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.433
quite well.

145
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.420
Now there's a particular issue with the accumulation of huge foreign

146
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.820
reserves in a country like Norway. And, you know,

147
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:17.520
I understand that some people in Norway feels that this is a,

148
00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:20.640
like a revenge of a history where for a long time,

149
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:25.110
Sweden was sort of the owner of Norway and maybe Norway will be the owner of

150
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:28.670
Sweden in the, in the future. True. So, you know, that's life, it's yours,

151
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:35.420
but look, I think ILO, uh, creates inequalities,

152
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:39.290
which sometimes can be, can be a problem in the case of Norway and Sweden.

153
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.140
You know, we are all rich or maybe, you know, we don't care so much,

154
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:46.790
but if you think of the impact of all in terms of inequality in the world today,

155
00:09:46.791 --> 00:09:50.360
you know, these creates extreme inequalities in particular in the middle East,

156
00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.540
which sometimes are very difficult to deal with. Uh, in my, in my book,

157
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:57.020
you know, I, I, for instance, I, quote joke if you take the total, uh,

158
00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.290
education, uh, budget of a country like Egypt,

159
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:04.130
which is a country with almost 100 million people, well,

160
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.020
this is 100 times less than the old revenues going to small countries

161
00:10:09.021 --> 00:10:13.070
without population in the Gulf area, a few hundred kilometers away.

162
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:18.350
And now that kind of extreme situation where you have big millions of

163
00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:22.700
young people, you know, we don't see a future. And then, you know,

164
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.150
Androids have billions of dollars in countries with no population.

165
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.620
I think this can create tension now, not in the case of Norway and Sweden,

166
00:10:30.621 --> 00:10:33.620
everybody's rich, or, you know, this is much less of a problem, but I think,

167
00:10:33.621 --> 00:10:36.200
you know, the actual relation of, uh,

168
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.750
of hundreds and millions of dollars in,

169
00:10:39.751 --> 00:10:43.460
in small groups of the world population, uh,

170
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.390
whereas you have large countries with little development prospect as this is

171
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:52.310
clear. So ideally what should Norway do with itself? Well,

172
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:58.430
should give it to some kind of AIDS well found, you know, to AIDS AIDS,

173
00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:02.450
to, to a world farm, to, to fight, to fight AIDS. That would,

174
00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.670
that would be like, okay, it was the whole fun,

175
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.400
no way so productive and as such the, you know,

176
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.950
social and educational products that you would live with it, you know,

177
00:11:12.951 --> 00:11:17.150
you will still be very rich. So not worried no way. And, you know, I think,

178
00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.590
let me tell you, see,

179
00:11:18.591 --> 00:11:23.360
let me say that very long run the impact of becoming a

180
00:11:23.361 --> 00:11:27.530
run to your country and the social democratic values of Norway,

181
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.480
I think is a real issue. You know,

182
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:34.160
right now the foreign reserves as the equivalent of what,

183
00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:38.000
about two years of GDP or two half years of GDP, you know,

184
00:11:38.001 --> 00:11:42.410
when it gets to five years, 10 years of GDP and the return, you know,

185
00:11:42.411 --> 00:11:46.010
if you have a 5% or 4% return and 10 years of GDP, it means you get,

186
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:51.080
you're going to have 40 or 50% of your domestic production just in foreign

187
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.340
capital income paid by the rest, the world. You know,

188
00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:57.140
this is a situation we've never seen that in history, you know,

189
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.870
countries that is accumulating so much foreign reserves relative to its domestic

190
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.880
production and labor force, what's the impact in the long run.

191
00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:10.210
And I don't know, that will be very interesting to see. I don't know.

192
00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:13.440
<v 0>We, we have actually in Norway and Sweden, um,</v>

193
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.760
removed the inheritance tax, uh,

194
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:23.010
so that we are free to, to let, uh, uh, wealth move on for generations,

195
00:12:23.011 --> 00:12:25.770
you know? Right. Uh, w what do you think about that?

196
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:28.710
<v 1>Well, you know, the, the premise that at the same time,</v>

197
00:12:28.711 --> 00:12:30.780
you have a very high total tax burden.

198
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:35.520
So you have to text someone and in practice, you are very consumption tax.

199
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.740
You are very high tax on labor income.

200
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.890
So if you look the overall evolution of the tax system,

201
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:45.000
I would say that what does happen in a country like Sweden is that you tend to

202
00:12:45.001 --> 00:12:48.840
tax a lot more of the low income and middle income groups,

203
00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.410
and less those who have a lot of Wells to transmit now,

204
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.320
is this good in the long run? You know, I don't know,

205
00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.610
I'm not saying we should tax returns at 100%, but 0%,

206
00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:02.040
you know, this is really very small.

207
00:13:02.041 --> 00:13:04.910
And if you look at other countries in Europe, you know,

208
00:13:04.911 --> 00:13:08.310
you look at countries like Germany, Britain,

209
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.070
it gets us to Cannes France. You know,

210
00:13:11.071 --> 00:13:14.640
you always have an inheritance tax in these countries and the top rate,

211
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:18.870
very large in your returns and not talking of a few hundred thousand euros,

212
00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.450
but if you leave tens of millions of euros,

213
00:13:21.451 --> 00:13:25.260
the top rate in all of these countries right now is about 40%,

214
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.690
sometimes 35, sometimes 45.

215
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:33.450
And I don't hear Mecca or Cameron saying that they want to

216
00:13:33.451 --> 00:13:36.810
do like Sweden and go to 0%. And, you know, these are not very,

217
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.750
very left-wing politicians, centers and center,

218
00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:45.210
right in the U S I don't hear that they have a 40% tax rate and Narita

219
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:49.350
in Japan. They just raised it to 55. It used to be 48.

220
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:52.650
I'm just saying 0%. You know, look,

221
00:13:52.651 --> 00:13:57.240
there's one country in Europe, a large country, which is Italy and obelisk,

222
00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:02.520
which put it at 0%. They have to say there. So this is the only country,

223
00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:07.350
you know, Sweden. So if I look at large countries in Europe now, of course,

224
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.730
there's maybe one reason in Sweden for doing that is that you feel that as a

225
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.230
relatively small open economy, you have strong competition with nowhere,

226
00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:18.420
with Finland, with Denmark. So you have no other choice.

227
00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:23.820
I understand this argument. Now, the problem is that you should do that,

228
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.920
and you should do the same for corporate tax.

229
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:29.310
And you end up with a 0% corporate tax with the same argument.

230
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.240
And then at some point to pay for your schools and your federal system,

231
00:14:33.241 --> 00:14:35.700
you will have to overtake someone. And this,

232
00:14:35.701 --> 00:14:40.620
someone will be the taxpayer who cannot move. So typically the low skill,

233
00:14:40.621 --> 00:14:45.300
medium, skilled taxpayers now is this boot for job creation, to overtax,

234
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:50.490
low skill and medium skilled labor incomes, the way we do in Sweden and Europe.

235
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.040
And, you know, at some point,

236
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:57.530
some of these social groups may feel that nobody cares about them. And,

237
00:14:57.531 --> 00:15:02.390
and I think, you know, this general evolution to work more competition,

238
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:06.680
to attract ice kill I Wells I income groups.

239
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:11.630
I understand that each country is dividual is in that kind of trap. But then,

240
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.640
you know, the low skill, medium skill groups,

241
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.810
they already sometime losing from globalization because they are put in

242
00:15:17.811 --> 00:15:21.530
competition with emerging countries, labor force,

243
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:22.850
if at the same time,

244
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:27.080
our tax system and our fiscal system is reinforcing this

245
00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:32.600
by taxing less people were more advantage. And then more, you know,

246
00:15:32.601 --> 00:15:35.750
I think in the long run that this will have political consequences.

247
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.360
<v 0>Just about the inheritance tax. I want it, who's going to inherit you.</v>

248
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:45.700
I was even thought about you. Haven't thought about that.

249
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:50.730
You're still young so I can see it. But I,

250
00:15:50.731 --> 00:15:55.030
I think that I totally agree with you on, especially on very low,

251
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:56.980
very low income and large difference.
