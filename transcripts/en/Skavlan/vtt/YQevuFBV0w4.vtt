1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.980
<v 0>These welcome to the show. No Gallagher</v>

2
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.340
[inaudible]. So, uh, so D do you do your, remember the, the election nights,

3
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:23.520
do you have the night it happen happened Brexit, Brexit.

4
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.280
<v 1>Uh, I was in the studio the day of the vote and, uh,</v>

5
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.030
there was a vote in station across the road from the studio,

6
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:36.110
and I thought I can't be bothered going to vote because who'd vote to leave.

7
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.600
Right. So, uh,

8
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.250
we were all told that we would stay by landslide. So we just carried on working,

9
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.770
kind of went home. And, uh,

10
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.000
I went to bed at about 11 and everyone said we were going to stay.

11
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:50.781
And that was it. And it's great.

12
00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:54.380
And I woke up the next morning and the world had changed. And, uh,

13
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.290
we've been in a mess ever since.

14
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.450
<v 0>You come from a very different background than, than the Johnson's. Yes. Uh,</v>

15
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.140
you came. Yeah, well, most people did, but

16
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.650
did you, it's not her fault. That's not hurtful, but do you have,

17
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.030
I mean, having, growing up in a very poor environment,

18
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.240
do you have an understanding of why it happened.

19
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.820
<v 1>At the time when the referendum was called?</v>

20
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.170
I was asked about it and I said that shouldn't be a referendum because I don't

21
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:31.940
think that knife at 99% of the people were qualified enough to understand

22
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.380
what was going on and watching the debates ever since in the announces of

23
00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:39.350
parliament, not even the people who were qualified or qualified.

24
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:44.480
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

25
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.660
<v 1>Now we are voted to leave by hook or by crook,</v>

26
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.540
we have to leave because if we don't, we're not a democracy.

27
00:01:50.541 --> 00:01:51.560
And if we're not a democracy,

28
00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:55.970
we cannot pontificate to the rest of the world about democracy. So we have to,

29
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.870
we have to leave now and make and make the best of it. But I kind of,

30
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.320
I think I hope in my heart of hearts one day we'll we'll go.

31
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.280
<v 0>Did, did, did, did, did the question split your family as well?</v>

32
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.590
You never got that one.

33
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.830
<v 1>Well, my family was very split on other things, uh, uh,</v>

34
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.010
not, well, my, my immediate family I've got young children,

35
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.750
me and me and my wife. Uh, no, we were, we were,

36
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.860
we w I, I would have voted. I mean, if it was a vote again tomorrow,

37
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.760
I'd vote to stay.

38
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.640
<v 2>Let me just ask you a question that I could,</v>

39
00:02:34.641 --> 00:02:38.900
given that there was the margin was quite slim and it's been three and a half

40
00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:42.740
years, right? Think of all the 16, three, you know,

41
00:02:42.741 --> 00:02:44.420
the young people who could vote. No.

42
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.660
And think of the majority that has probably gone to

43
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.810
happy hunting grounds.

44
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.180
So actually there's maybe a majority in this country to stay in,

45
00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.200
but you think that still, we have to observe, like, I.

46
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.760
<v 1>Hate, I hate this term, the people's vote vote,</v>

47
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.320
and for better, or for worse, the people have spoken. Yeah.

48
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.600
They can't have referendums legal referendums with

49
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.960
illegal vote. And then so, but actually we don't like while you voted,

50
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:20.830
so we're going to have to have another one. It's not fair. It's not fair. Yeah.

51
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.170
<v 0>Um, so I take it. You don't, you don't want to leave the EU if, if,</v>

52
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.270
if it was up to you, but you, you did 10 years ago, you left the Oasis.

53
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.930
How did you, you, you, and it is 10 years ago this fall. And do you,

54
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.350
it was very abruptly. And, um, uh,

55
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.130
it was some said it was brave South side. It was stupid.

56
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.600
How what's, what's your thoughts when you, when you think back on that moment.

57
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.970
<v 1>I didn't think it was brave or stupid.</v>

58
00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:54.480
It was just inevitable that it was gonna happen. And, uh, you know,

59
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.490
you got to a certain point in your life, or as I've,

60
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.940
I was 42 at the time.

61
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.280
And still really, you know, if, if,

62
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.210
if you're in a job that makes,

63
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.930
that's making you unhappy at that stage in your life, you just got to think,

64
00:04:09.931 --> 00:04:14.610
well, you know, there's no point, I mean, surely the pursuit of happiness is,

65
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.210
is everybody's right. You know what I mean? And, um,

66
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.210
the way that it's been rewritten by the other fella is like, you know,

67
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.050
you mean any deals? Oh yeah.

68
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.230
All I did was leave abound.

69
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.370
That's all I did. You know, I didn't kill anybody yet.

70
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.580
Um, uh, you know, to some people it's the end of the world, you know,

71
00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:44.960
it's the end that people can't will not still accept it. I got asked about,

72
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.600
well, that's fantastic. That's great. You know, and I, I,

73
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.730
they've got the music and they've got the memories if they ever came to see us.

74
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.450
<v 0>But it w it was, I mean, it, it was an emotional thing.</v>

75
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.950
It wasn't thought through. Was it?

76
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.190
<v 1>Well, it was thought through very briefly in the back of a car</v>

77
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.620
outside, look, sitting outside a festival that we were headlining.

78
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.430
It was about 70,000 people there. And, um,

79
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.940
there was a huge fight in the dressing room.

80
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.800
And I sat in the back of the car and I calmed down on my security guard,

81
00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:24.960
said, are we staying or going? And I made,

82
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.530
I I've been on the verge of leaving a couple of times before.

83
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.740
And I just thought, tonight's the night,

84
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.990
the worst thing was leaving the people in the gig. I that's, I've never,

85
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.120
I'd never pulled a gig on purpose in my life, but, um, it was meant to be,

86
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.760
you know, and I've got no regrets at all.

87
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.730
<v 0>So when from there,</v>

88
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.360
when was the next time you heard from your brother? Uh,

89
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.160
did he try to call him desperate? Was I got.

90
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.080
<v 1>A legal letter from his lawyers that he kindly managed to</v>

91
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:05.480
give it to the daily minute of the day before he sent it to me.

92
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.220
So it was on the front page of the newspapers. And if you can believe this,

93
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.120
he was going to Sue me for libel,

94
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.640
for ruining his character.

95
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.000
<v 0>For me, his characters somewhat.</v>

96
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.850
<v 1>Like slammed the wave. I don't know what the legal.</v>

97
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.110
<v 0>Term, you know. So who, who,</v>

98
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.750
who would you prefer if you had to choose, who,

99
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.100
who would you prefer to have as your brother today? Uh, Liam or bar restaurant.

100
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.363
[inaudible].

101
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.410
<v 1>Say Boris is more entertaining.</v>

102
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.880
His use of the English language is far superior Liam's by looking at it.

103
00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.740
<v 0>So I don't know. I probably wouldn't get on with these kids wise.</v>

104
00:06:59.741 --> 00:07:04.240
I think Liam is magnificent. She's got magnificent.

105
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:10.690
[inaudible].

106
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:15.400
<v 1>We were watching, uh, the, the panel show on sky, me and my wife recently.</v>

107
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.850
And we both said she's looking great.

108
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.440
<v 0>Yeah. Well, what's the thing with Boris here.</v>

109
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.780
What about an interesting haircut? It's like, it's not sleep. That is fine.

110
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.620
I don't think it's he, you can't shape it or anything? No.

111
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.790
<v 1>It's not. As, it's not as, uh, thick.</v>

112
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.460
<v 0>It's a different texture. Tell me, do you, w w when,</v>

113
00:07:42.461 --> 00:07:46.960
when you look back at those years before the breakup with

114
00:07:46.961 --> 00:07:47.794
Oasis,

115
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.510
do you think about things you didn't appreciate enough?

116
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.260
<v 1>I don't regret a single day being in that bond, because I always liked the work.</v>

117
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.870
I often used to feel sorry for the other guys in the band,

118
00:07:58.871 --> 00:08:03.670
because I was the sole writer and I always have to work to keep me

119
00:08:03.671 --> 00:08:07.690
grounded, but it actually kept me sane in a way, you know, because I was,

120
00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.960
I was busy work and, you know, directing it and all that,

121
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.900
but I don't regret anything. I don't, I don't,

122
00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.920
there's some things that I said about other people that I wish I hadn't said.

123
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:23.500
And there's some things that I did that I wish I did,

124
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:28.600
but if I could go back and live it all again, I'd do it in a heartbeat.

125
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.403
<v 0>From the outside.</v>

126
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:35.080
It looks like you are a cool as a

127
00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:39.550
cucumber compared to your brother. And, uh,

128
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.610
I wonder today you have, you have three kids.

129
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.120
<v 1>Actually annoys him more than you could imagine. In fact that.</v>

130
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:51.850
<v 0>Some people think that, or the fact that you are that because,</v>

131
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.220
yeah, because that can be.

132
00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.640
<v 1>When you're arguing with someone when you're and the other person is just like,</v>

133
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.890
whatever. I mean, it's infuriating, of course, which is why he's so angry,

134
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.650
because every time he sends out a tweet, I'm just like,

135
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:08.720
I've gotten to know what he's going on about half the time. It's.

136
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:10.830
<v 0>Super irritating. I guess I wouldn't.</v>

137
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:15.570
<v 1>I don't, for me, it's not, I don't care for me. It's, it's,</v>

138
00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:20.370
he's kind of taken this. He's kind of taken a,

139
00:09:20.371 --> 00:09:25.020
it kind of insults my wife a lot. He's, he's, he's kind of a,

140
00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.880
he's floated this idea that a lot of morons on the internet have

141
00:09:29.881 --> 00:09:32.640
adopted this idea that Oasis would be getting back together,

142
00:09:32.641 --> 00:09:34.200
but my wife won't let me,

143
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.360
so there's this fear that I'm at the kitchen table saying, Oh, please,

144
00:09:39.361 --> 00:09:44.040
can I get part with Oasis? No, no. And I'm like,

145
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.150
please, please, please, please. No, uh, but the thing is because like,

146
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:52.170
most of the people who surf the internet are morons,

147
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.910
unfortunately present complete absolutely the course on,

148
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.480
fortunately that's now become that, like this thing, you know what I mean?

149
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.700
And my, my wife gets a lot of abuse,

150
00:10:02.701 --> 00:10:05.790
which is not fair because she's gone nothing to do with it at all.

151
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.520
And he threatens my kids and all that kind of thing. And it's all,

152
00:10:08.521 --> 00:10:13.020
it all gets a bit stupid. But, um, I w I,

153
00:10:13.021 --> 00:10:17.190
I would say grow up one day, but he's 48 now. So it's.

154
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.350
<v 0>So you had a little time left probably to, to grow.</v>

155
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:22.970
<v 1>I might do it in his fifties. Maybe.</v>

156
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.070
<v 0>It shouldn't be said he's not here to defend himself tonight. Yeah.</v>

157
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.090
<v 1>Uh, no, but she'd be watching this now. Furiously tweeting.</v>

158
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.160
<v 0>How, but how, as a father of three,</v>

159
00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.300
how do you with that cool, uh,

160
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:46.010
attitude deal with the tantrum because all kids have tantrums.

161
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:47.690
<v 1>Yeah. Well, I would just say, well,</v>

162
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.280
when my kids have tantrums, I find them hilarious,

163
00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:55.431
laugh. You know,

164
00:10:55.431 --> 00:10:59.210
when they're kind of like trying to hit you like a seven year old trying to hit

165
00:10:59.211 --> 00:11:04.070
you, and you're just like weighed in on the best way. Well,

166
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.870
they say the best way to, um, you know, not the children's just to ignore them,

167
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.540
you know, but I mean, I, I do cause I'm not on social media, but, um,

168
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.870
it's difficult sometimes. You know what I mean? And it, I,

169
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:24.140
it has caused a lot of, uh, not upset,

170
00:11:24.141 --> 00:11:24.801
but there's a lot of,

171
00:11:24.801 --> 00:11:27.650
there's been a lot of things that have been said that are just like,

172
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.890
you're not going to be able to take that back. Do you know what I mean?

173
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:34.910
And I was born with one fatal flaw in my character, which is,

174
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.920
I will not forgive people. I can't do it. Or there's something in me that just,

175
00:11:39.921 --> 00:11:42.800
I haven't got any forgiveness at all. Once the lines.

176
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:44.773
<v 0>Will be no more.</v>

177
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.610
<v 1>I'm very stubborn. And what's the line has been crossed. I'm afraid. I can't,</v>

178
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.280
I can't allow myself to, uh, to go back, but I guess if kid has a tantrum.

179
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.300
<v 0>You can forgive him.</v>

180
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.050
<v 1>My children, I don't speak to my children.</v>

181
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:05.280
<v 0>How will you make sure that your kids stay friends,</v>

182
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.030
but then the same thing won't happen again, the sentence of the fathers

183
00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:16.373
hour.

184
00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:20.400
<v 1>My children's life and atmosphere at home was vastly different from the one that</v>

185
00:12:20.401 --> 00:12:25.140
I grew up in Oz was a very dysfunctional family.

186
00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:30.090
Uh, when you think about it now and never really nobody ever really got on.

187
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.640
Um, and cause you know,

188
00:12:32.641 --> 00:12:36.000
we grew up in the seventies and there was poverty and unemployment, blah, blah,

189
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.410
and all that. Um,

190
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:43.080
well my children's home life is very different.

191
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:48.180
I've got two loving parents and you know, they love the stepsister and um,

192
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:50.790
it's just, it's, it's,

193
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.640
it's a different atmosphere and you are a product of your environment, you know?

194
00:12:53.641 --> 00:12:57.180
And if, if, if you're growing up in a house full of arguments,

195
00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.990
you will eventually become like we became, you know,

196
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.510
and if you grow up in a loving environment, you know,

197
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.010
the people love and respect each other.

198
00:13:05.011 --> 00:13:07.770
You will eventually grow up to be like that. You know what I mean? And, and,

199
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.860
and then as a parent, you cross your fingers and hope for the best.

200
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.833
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

201
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:21.630
[inaudible] I mean, you're both family, people,

202
00:13:21.631 --> 00:13:24.330
family with big families.

203
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.040
Can it sometimes be too much. I mean, the Johnson's are quite many.

204
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.820
<v 2>There are too many, many would say. Um,</v>

205
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:38.580
I think it's hard for people who marry into the family and

206
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.710
one of my sisters in law, sisters in law. Oh,

207
00:13:42.711 --> 00:13:47.700
I love them all dearly though. They're all incredible women. Um,

208
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:52.480
I was like saying, are you you guys coming to this? Or you know,

209
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.000
the football or blah.

210
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.740
And then I got this text back from my brother Leo's wife saying, no,

211
00:13:58.741 --> 00:14:03.570
this it's a J F w. And I said, what's that? And she said,

212
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.780
Oh, don't, you know, it's a Johnson free weekend. And.

213
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:08.790
<v 0>All the in-laws have this.</v>

214
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.510
<v 2>Concept of a Johnson free weekend where they're given a free pass and they</v>

215
00:14:12.511 --> 00:14:16.050
didn't have to come to some Sunday lunch or, you know,

216
00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.740
tribal clam gathering. Well, I mean.

217
00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.600
<v 1>Family politics can be exhausting.</v>

218
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:29.310
<v 2>I don't know. Has Liam got kids? Yes. Many. How many</v>

219
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.333
officially.

220
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:35.520
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

221
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.540
<v 2>So you, your kids are a bit younger possibly, right? Yeah.</v>

222
00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:44.460
But aren't there occasions when you will have to be together

223
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:48.850
for weddings. And then how does that work? No,

224
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.680
nobody, uh.

225
00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.130
<v 1>As yet to get married yet. So the,</v>

226
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.060
the situation has never arisen, but of course,

227
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:01.640
of course. And it's going to be very interesting.

228
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.760
<v 0>Because that generation, they don't see each other.</v>

229
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:09.680
<v 1>Either. Uh, they do. Yeah. My daughter is 20. Uh, we'll see.</v>

230
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:13.520
Uh, and as has gone to the same school as some of Liam's kids.

231
00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:18.850
<v 0>When, when do you work apart from touring? What do you write? I write music.</v>

232
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:20.163
<v 1>Every day.</v>

233
00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:24.040
I never really switched off from music it's because I don't have any hobbies.

234
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:25.930
I don't mind my,

235
00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:30.700
my hobby growing up was playing the guitar and I've been lucky

236
00:15:30.701 --> 00:15:35.350
enough to now it's a profession, you know, I don't, I don't drive.

237
00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:37.270
So I've not got a fleet of cars.

238
00:15:37.271 --> 00:15:40.270
I could just go and take drive around Europe or anything. You know what I mean?

239
00:15:40.271 --> 00:15:42.550
I don't drive or you don't have a license to drive.

240
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.900
I've never had a driving lesson. It's never interested me ever. Um,

241
00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:49.930
and so I, did you buy a lots of cars? I did.

242
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:53.380
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

243
00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:57.430
<v 1>It's kind of a double thing. You know what I mean? I bought, I had, uh, I had,</v>

244
00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:01.930
um, when we first got paid properly, uh,

245
00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:06.700
I always wanted a Jaguar Mark two. And, uh, I found this company that,

246
00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:11.830
that found old cars and put modern engines in them and all that.

247
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.450
And I went to see this place.

248
00:16:13.451 --> 00:16:16.690
It took me three hours to get there in a car and they were going to,

249
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.590
they found this thing and it was the year I was born in 1967 and they say,

250
00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.110
we'll take three years to build. And I was like, great.

251
00:16:23.111 --> 00:16:27.190
I'll easily have passed my test in three years. And three years later,

252
00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:31.420
I was in my house in St. John's wood. And then

253
00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:35.510
Laurie pulled up the car on the back of it in the street. And of course.

254
00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.533
<v 0>God's amazing.</v>

255
00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.540
<v 1>Get me. One of those cars wanted a guy walked in with a clipboard.</v>

256
00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.810
So there's Mr. Gallagher there. I was like, hi,

257
00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:48.220
this is your car. And I'd forgotten that I'd bought and paid for.

258
00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:50.500
<v 0>It. I'm still going. I'm still.</v>

259
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.420
<v 1>Going to it's. Isn't a garbage somewhere.</v>

260
00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:57.170
And I think it's got like 12 miles on the clock. So I'm going to kind of leave.

261
00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:58.870
<v 0>It good news for your kids.</v>

262
00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:01.210
<v 1>Well, I'm going to leave it for my kids to fight over.</v>

263
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.260
<v 0>No, it's fantastic to have you on the show. Thank you so much.</v>
