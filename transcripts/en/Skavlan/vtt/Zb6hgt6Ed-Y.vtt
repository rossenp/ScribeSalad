1
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.880
<v 0>First of all, we were talking about creativity. Uh, how,</v>

2
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:10.110
how is that? How is creativity and sleep connected?

3
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.530
<v 1>They are very connected. Uh, we know that sleep inspires problem solving.</v>

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.730
It's sort of, it's almost as though sleep is like, um,

5
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.590
it's a group therapy for memories that sleep gathers in all of the information

6
00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:26.030
that you've been learning during the day.

7
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.810
And it starts to collide it in these strange, connected ways.

8
00:00:29.811 --> 00:00:34.550
It's sort of informational alchemy as it were so that you wake up the next

9
00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:38.900
day with a revised mind wide web of associations.

10
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.360
And we can now demonstrate that in the laboratory,

11
00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:44.990
we can sort of give you these problems to solve that seem difficult before

12
00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:47.750
sleep. And then we give you a full eight hours.

13
00:00:47.751 --> 00:00:49.580
We measure your sleeping brainwaves.

14
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.260
You wake up the next day and you're three times more likely to be able to solve

15
00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:57.440
a problem than if you just to stay awake on a problem.

16
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.550
And that's the reason that no one has ever told you to stay awake on a problem.

17
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.380
Instead, they tell you to sleep on it on a problem. And, and what,

18
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.850
what I find fascinating about that in every language that I've inquired about to

19
00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:15.680
date that phrase, sleeping on a problem, it seems to exist, you know,

20
00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:19.130
from French to Swahili. Um, you know, we, the British,

21
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.570
we say you sleep on a problem.

22
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.680
I think the French translation is a little bit closer to you sleep with a

23
00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:25.514
problem.

24
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.643
<v 0>Yeah. You know,</v>

25
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.100
[inaudible] says so much about the difference between the British and the French

26
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.100
British. We speak French, we sleep with a prop.

27
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.410
So be it, this is the, this is the good side of sleep.

28
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.060
But also, I mean, we do sleep less. I mean, we,

29
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.330
a hundred years ago we slept a lot more didn't we?

30
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.840
<v 1>That's right. Yeah. So a survey done back in 1942,</v>

31
00:01:56.841 --> 00:02:01.070
demonstrated that the average adult was sleeping 7.9 hours a night.

32
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.090
Now that number is closer to six hours and 30 minutes.

33
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.340
So there's been this incredible erosion of sleep time throughout industrialized

34
00:02:10.341 --> 00:02:13.760
nations. It's happened across probably about the past 70 years.

35
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.940
That's almost 20%. You know, it took mother nature,

36
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.980
3.6 million years to put this necessity of eight hours of sleep in

37
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:25.700
place. And then within the space of an evolutionary blink of the eye,

38
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.370
we've locked off 20% of that time.

39
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.000
<v 0>Many people try, they try to sleep,</v>

40
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.560
but either they can't fall asleep or they will, they will wake up midnight.

41
00:02:36.561 --> 00:02:39.130
And I mean at four in the morning and

42
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.130
be able to sleep again.

43
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.330
<v 1>Yeah. And those are classically the two forms of insomnia that we have.</v>

44
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.990
One is called sleep onset, insomnia, difficulty falling asleep,

45
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.890
the other's called sleep maintenance insomnia. So you can fall asleep,

46
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.140
but you can't stay asleep. You wake back up.

47
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.870
And certainly what we know is that one of the principal causes of insomnia,

48
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.760
which by the way, is twice as likely to be present in women than in men.

49
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:11.170
It's a far more female, um, impacted disorder. Um,

50
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.213
the principal,

51
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.140
cause there seems to be anxiety that that sort of fight or flight branch of the

52
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:20.380
nervous system gets ramped up. And when that gets ramped up,

53
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.100
it's very difficult to fall asleep. So what do you do about that? Well,

54
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.260
there's lots of things you can try.

55
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.130
Meditation has been demonstrated to be remarkably effective.

56
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.200
It just sort of quiet down the nervous system allows you to fall asleep. Um,

57
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.120
the other thing is actually a worry journal now as a hard-nosed

58
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:43.210
scientist, when I was looking at the evidence and reviewing this, um,

59
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.350
I thought it surely doesn't work, which is an hour before bed.

60
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.150
Just write down all of the concerns and the things that you have on your mind.

61
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.610
<v 2>It helps you. Do.</v>

62
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.770
<v 1>You do that with practice? If I get journaling?</v>

63
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.590
<v 2>Yeah. I just do write down all my IDs and everything I worry about.</v>

64
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.940
And also in the sad times,

65
00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:06.780
everything I have to be happy about and it really helps me fall asleep.

66
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.160
It's really good. I do it.

67
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.170
<v 1>Finish it with at least three things that are positive three good things about</v>

68
00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:16.650
your day or three things that you're grateful for. You already know it,

69
00:04:16.651 --> 00:04:17.450
which is great.

70
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.350
<v 0>But, but it's, it's uh,</v>

71
00:04:19.351 --> 00:04:23.010
another alternative of course is a simpler is sleeping pills.

72
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.870
<v 1>Would be true. Unfortunately though,</v>

73
00:04:27.871 --> 00:04:30.630
there are three problems with sleeping pills. Firstly,

74
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.490
they are a class of drugs that we call the sedative hypnotics and sedation is

75
00:04:35.491 --> 00:04:40.020
not sleep, but you mistake the former for the latter. When you take these pills,

76
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.540
now they just not your cortex out.

77
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.960
The other two issues is that sleeping pills have been associated with a

78
00:04:45.961 --> 00:04:49.350
significantly higher risk of death, as well as cancer,

79
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.450
which is where you work with a therapist.

80
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.890
And it's a psychological intervention just as effective as sleeping pills in the

81
00:04:55.891 --> 00:04:59.580
short term. But what's great is that when you finish with your therapist,

82
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.230
you keep that good sleep going. Whereas when you stop taking sleeping pills,

83
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.920
you usually not only go back to the bad sleep that you are having,

84
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.920
you often have, what's called rebound insomnia,

85
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.060
which is that your sleep gets even worse. You're a fan of separate bedrooms.

86
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.990
Yeah.

87
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.160
So I think for some people with sleep divorce can prevent you from having a real

88
00:05:20.161 --> 00:05:21.360
one. Um,

89
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:26.160
we know that about 30 to 40% of people who are surveyed anonymously,

90
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.203
by the way,

91
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.280
will admit to not sleeping in the same bed of the remaining people who do go to

92
00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:35.490
bed and sleep or start trying to sleep in the same bed.

93
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.100
They often wake up in a different bed.

94
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.300
About 50% of those will wake up in a different bed. And what's,

95
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.370
I think interesting is that partners will often disrupt sleep males far

96
00:05:47.371 --> 00:05:50.760
more likely to snore and have a sleep disorder that we call sleep apnea.

97
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.500
As I said, females twice,

98
00:05:52.501 --> 00:05:57.090
the rates of insomnia and that tossing and turning and that snoring can cause

99
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.860
it can cause poor sleep in one or both of the partners.

100
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.470
And when you have a sleep divorce,

101
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.310
essentially you start sleeping in separate bedrooms or you sleep in separate

102
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:12.170
beds. Now the stigma there is that if you're not sleeping together,

103
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.700
then you're not sleeping together. But the opposite is true.

104
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.020
What we know is that men who are not sleeping well will have a level of

105
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:24.740
testosterone, which is that of someone 10 years, their senior.

106
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.750
So a lack of sleep will age a man by a decade. And for a woman,

107
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:33.260
we also know that for every extra hour of sleep that she adds,

108
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.330
there is a 13 to 15% increase in the desire to be physically intimate with

109
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:39.164
her partner.

110
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.850
<v 0>If you're getting good sleep, I'm going to get some sleep,</v>

111
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.930
is the message coming across it. So.

112
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.110
<v 1>Oddly enough, ironically, if you're,</v>

113
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.360
if you're sleeping well in separate bedrooms,

114
00:06:52.361 --> 00:06:55.630
your physical relationship tends to actually improve as a company.

115
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.170
<v 2>Interested in the idea of a sleep divorce because my husband snores a lot.</v>

116
00:06:59.171 --> 00:07:03.130
He has sleep apnea, but I'm very aware that if we slept in different bedrooms,

117
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.790
he would die because it's when you have sleep apnea. This is why.

118
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:09.603
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah.</v>

119
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:16.803
<v 0>Yes.</v>

120
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.500
<v 2>I have to save his life. I have to wake up and then I saved his life.</v>

121
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.220
So if I was sleeping in another room, I would get a lot more sleep myself,

122
00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.430
but my husband would be dead. Like kind of, can you die of sleep?

123
00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:30.040
Apnea is basically what I'm asking you. Can you die of snoring.

124
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:31.360
<v 1>And die of snoring,</v>

125
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.890
but you die chronically because the disrupted sleep will lead to an increase

126
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:39.130
risk of things like diabetes, stroke or cardiovascular.

127
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.840
<v 2>Disease. To be honest.</v>

128
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.490
<v 0>I'm not going to rush to judgment on that.</v>

129
00:07:45.491 --> 00:07:48.520
But clearly the sleep issue is causing you some,

130
00:07:48.521 --> 00:07:53.200
some anger problems that we can, we can talk about, but in all seriousness,

131
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.660
that that sort of chopping and the cessation of breath.

132
00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.560
<v 1>It happens, you know, five to 10 times an hour.</v>

133
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.720
<v 0>Or a minute. In fact, now.</v>

134
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.580
<v 1>If you were to say to someone, you know,</v>

135
00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:08.500
I'm going to come into your room every night and maybe about 40 or 50 times

136
00:08:08.501 --> 00:08:09.100
throughout tonight,

137
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.780
I'm going to strangle you to the point where you stop breathing. It's not there.

138
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.350
<v 0>Yeah. That's ridiculous that that's terrible. Yeah.</v>

139
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:18.460
<v 1>No one would do that to me,</v>

140
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:22.180
but that's what the disorder of sleep apnea will do to someone it's a

141
00:08:22.181 --> 00:08:25.600
horrifically serious disorder. So if you know someone who's snoring,

142
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:29.890
please go and have them see a doctor. Um, it is life-threatening,

143
00:08:29.891 --> 00:08:34.360
it will bring on and hasten the speed of many of those diseases that are killing

144
00:08:34.361 --> 00:08:36.040
us. I can just show him.

145
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.260
<v 0>Exactly. This is perfect,</v>

146
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.380
where you can bring him home and he can tell you directly to your husband

147
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.760
[inaudible] is it a big difference between the quality or what,

148
00:08:50.761 --> 00:08:54.940
what is most important? The quality or the quantity of sleep?

149
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.040
We used to.

150
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.550
<v 1>Think it was quantity. And the advice we give is, you know,</v>

151
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:03.120
somewhere around eight hours of sleep. And, and you asked me the question,

152
00:09:03.121 --> 00:09:07.350
you know, I certainly give myself a non-negotiable eight hour sleep opportunity.

153
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:11.700
Um, not because I want to be a poster child or sort of, you know,

154
00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:15.930
practice what I preach. If you understood the importance of sleep as I do,

155
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.310
you it's selfish,

156
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:20.400
you would choose to do nothing other than give yourself that sleep. You know,

157
00:09:20.401 --> 00:09:24.060
I don't want, um, disease or sickness. I don't want to short a life.

158
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.970
I want a longer life and a longer, healthier life,

159
00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:30.960
but it's the best insurance policy that I know of in terms of healthcare.

160
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:36.600
So certainly quantity is important, but probably in the last five or six years,

161
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.610
quality is also critical too. It's a combination of the two.

162
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.340
So just because you may be in bed for eight hours,

163
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:49.050
if you're not getting that continuous sleep and the deep quality sleep first,

164
00:09:49.051 --> 00:09:51.780
and then the sort of the dream sleep later in the night,

165
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.850
you need all of these things to get those benefits. I am in trouble.

166
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.943
Me too.

167
00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:03.080
<v 0>Yeah. I'm a desperately depressing guest on</v>

168
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.530
[inaudible]. You'll see a lot of politicians bragging about,

169
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.420
I only need four hours of sleep.

170
00:10:17.421 --> 00:10:19.970
I only need five hours of legendary politicians.

171
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:21.910
<v 1>Like, like, uh, Margaret Thatcher.</v>

172
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.230
<v 0>Ronald Reagan, uh.</v>

173
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.720
<v 1>Current head of state in America, you know, Donald Trump.</v>

174
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:29.720
<v 0>They don't sleep much count</v>

175
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:42.200
[inaudible] do they? I mean, does it help with power naps then? Do you,

176
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:46.780
I mean, is that where power comes from? Well, firstly, we know that.

177
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.140
<v 1>The number of people who can survive on seven hours of sleep or less without</v>

178
00:10:51.141 --> 00:10:55.340
showing any impairment rounded to a whole number and expressed as a percent of

179
00:10:55.341 --> 00:10:59.600
the population is zero. I see.

180
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:04.370
So once to anyone suggesting that they can survive on five or four hours of

181
00:11:04.371 --> 00:11:08.270
sleep, um, is a fallacy. And you know, it strikes me as interesting.

182
00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:12.200
One of the most significant lifestyle factors determining whether or not you

183
00:11:12.201 --> 00:11:15.350
will develop Alzheimer's disease is the amount of sleep that you're getting.

184
00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:20.420
Because at night there is this remarkable cleansing system that kicks into high

185
00:11:20.421 --> 00:11:25.160
gear that washes away the toxic proteins that are linked to Alzheimer's disease.

186
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.300
So you get this power cleanse at night, it's sort of good, night's sleep clean.

187
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:34.320
You know, technology is a problem. Uh, the image, uh, sort of issue I think is,

188
00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:38.930
is problematic caffeine, alcohol. Those two are not the friends of sleep.

189
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.510
It turns out only, only.

190
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.600
<v 0>Caffeine in the morning or yeah.</v>

191
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:46.970
<v 1>Yeah. So caffeine in the morning is okay, you know,</v>

192
00:11:46.971 --> 00:11:48.620
a couple Oh two in the morning,

193
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:53.680
but one of the problems with caffeine is that it has a half-life of six

194
00:11:53.681 --> 00:11:56.500
hours and it has a quarter-life of 12 hours.

195
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.160
What that means is that if you have a cup of coffee at noon,

196
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:04.450
a quarter of that caffeine is still circulating in your brain at midnight.

197
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:08.080
So if you have a cup of coffee, you know, around midday,

198
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.480
it's the equivalent of getting into bed at night.

199
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:11.950
And before you turn the light out,

200
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.730
you Swick a quarter of a cup of coffee and you hope for a good night of sleep.

201
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.380
It's just not going to happen.

202
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.490
<v 0>Alcohol is that also in the morning?</v>

203
00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:25.350
It's strange, but, uh, alcohol.

204
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.910
<v 1>Is again a group of drugs that we call the sedative. So again,</v>

205
00:12:29.911 --> 00:12:34.410
you're just knocking yourself out with the nightcap alcohol also litters your

206
00:12:34.411 --> 00:12:37.770
sleep with many more awakenings, it's called fragmented sleep.

207
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:42.090
So you don't feel as restored by your sleep the next morning and find the

208
00:12:42.091 --> 00:12:45.660
alcohol is a very powerful drug of blocking your dream sleep.

209
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:51.540
And so the advice that I would never give on a television program in

210
00:12:51.541 --> 00:12:53.190
front of a public audience would be, yes,

211
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:54.630
you should go to the pub in the morning.

212
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.050
<v 0>Um, that way by the evening, the alcohol is out consistent.</v>

213
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.680
<v 1>And you're just fine, but I would never say that as, as a professional,</v>

214
00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:02.514
you know.

215
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.383
<v 0>Could we cut that?</v>

216
00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.610
[inaudible] I have to ask you because we're one week away here in Europe now,

217
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:22.170
uh, w from what we call summertime or,

218
00:13:22.171 --> 00:13:26.640
or I think it's called daylight savings time. That's right. Yeah. Um,

219
00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.870
uh, and, and then we, we changed sort of changed the day. I,

220
00:13:30.871 --> 00:13:33.810
you have it in America as well. I think you have it already. That's right. Yeah.

221
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.790
And so, um, does that affect us?

222
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.790
<v 1>It affects us markedly, and I think there's good reason to,</v>

223
00:13:38.791 --> 00:13:43.650
to disabuse society of that impact. And you may think, you know,

224
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:47.940
what's the harm of one hour of sleep. Well, I'll tell you this in the spring,

225
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:49.740
when we lose one hour of sleep,

226
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:54.330
the next day we see a subsequent 24% increase in heart attacks,

227
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:56.610
which is dramatic.

228
00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.800
And we see an equivalent rise in the risk of suicide,

229
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:06.090
suicidal thoughts, suicidal attempts, suicide completion.

230
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.900
We also see a spike in road traffic accidents that following day,

231
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.880
this is all just one hour of lost sleep.

232
00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:16.440
This is how fragile and vulnerable our bodies are to even just the smallest

233
00:14:16.441 --> 00:14:20.370
perturbation of sleep. Now in the autumn, in the fall,

234
00:14:20.371 --> 00:14:22.230
when we gain an hour of sleep,

235
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:26.040
we see a beautiful 21% reduction in heart attacks.

236
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:30.960
So it's bi-directional why are we doing this to society?

237
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.410
May we should maintain stability so we should take it away.

238
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.250
I think we should take it away. Take it away.

239
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.053
<v 0>Yeah. Thank you.</v>

240
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.360
It's actually something that is quite easy to do, do, do something.

241
00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:48.750
<v 1>Yeah. It's really not that difficult.</v>

242
00:14:48.751 --> 00:14:51.240
And the lives that it could save would be non-trivial.

243
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.400
<v 0>Yeah, y'all gonna, y'all gotta do a song called animal. Uh,</v>

244
00:14:55.401 --> 00:14:57.290
so please take the stage. Thank you so much.

245
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.060
[inaudible] they know how to sleep well,

246
00:15:08.061 --> 00:15:12.170
human beings are the only species that deliberately deprived itself of sleep for

247
00:15:12.171 --> 00:15:13.070
no apparent reason.

248
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:16.820
No other species throughout evolution has decided to take sleep away.

249
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:20.180
Matthew, thank you so much for being

250
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:27.980
