1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.310
<v 0>I was in what they call a follow-up car,</v>

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.820
which the car immediately behind the presidential car,

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.580
but they're only about five feet between the two cars.

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.830
And this was when you heard a shot. We were traveling down main street,

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.140
large crowds in Dallas, friendly, enthusiastic. Again, we had to turn,

6
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.410
make a right-hand turn at the end of Maine and then a left on a street called

7
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:27.150
Elm street that put us right in front of a building called the Texas school book

8
00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:27.984
depository.

9
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.790
And I was on the car immediately behind the presidential car was on the

10
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.070
left-hand side. On the running board.

11
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.030
I was scanning to my left and ahead head where there was an overpass.

12
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.860
And all of a sudden I heard this explosive noise over my right shoulder.

13
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.340
And so I immediately looked toward that noise,

14
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.260
but I only got as far as the back of the president's car that it

15
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.360
goes, I saw him react to something. So I'm grabbing his throat like this.

16
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.800
And then he went down to his left and I knew something is wrong.

17
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.930
So I jumped off the car,

18
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.400
ran as fast as I could to get up on top of the back of the president's car to

19
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:09.181
form a shield.

20
00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:13.680
There are a barrier with my body so that no further damage could be done.

21
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.050
So you wanted to take the bullet if there was going to be any more gunfire? Yes,

22
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.210
that was my job. And so, uh, just before I got to the car,

23
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.270
there was a third shot, rang out.

24
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.710
The first shot hits the president just below the neck line to the right of the

25
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:35.880
spinal column and came out through the throat. Didn't hit anything hard,

26
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:38.730
just soft material. So it was survivable,

27
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.030
but the third shot that hit him. He only hit got hit twice,

28
00:01:42.031 --> 00:01:45.990
but it was the third shot that hit him in the back of the head here.

29
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.120
But it exploded out here and it created

30
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.460
a situation where the brain matter blood bone fragments all came out of the

31
00:01:56.461 --> 00:02:01.170
wound. It was quite destructive. And this was what you saw when you,

32
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.300
when you came to the car. I not only saw it,

33
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:07.110
but I felt it because blood came all over me and brain matter.

34
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.780
And over Mrs. Kennedy and the trunk.

35
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.430
<v 1>I was up army headquarter,</v>

36
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.930
about 30 of us had been recruited to,

37
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.810
to be trained as, um,

38
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.900
decoding assistant. We just got to the army headquarter,

39
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.940
which was 1.8 kilometer from hypo center.

40
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.620
About one mile,

41
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.700
I was on the second floor of the wooden building.

42
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.920
I saw the bluish white flush in the window,

43
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.080
and then my body was thrown up in the air.

44
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.300
I do remember the sensation of floating in the air because all

45
00:02:53.301 --> 00:02:57.800
the buildings were flattened by the blast. And, uh,

46
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.680
obviously the building I was in was falling and my body was

47
00:03:02.681 --> 00:03:03.820
together falling.

48
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.540
<v 2>So, so you cannot, you can only from, from the, the destination itself,</v>

49
00:03:09.541 --> 00:03:13.860
what you remember is the flash and you yourself in the air.

50
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.750
That's right. No, no sound.

51
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.780
<v 1>Well, people in the distance heard that roaring sound,</v>

52
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.090
but I didn't. I was right in it.

53
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.080
And sometime later I found myself in a

54
00:03:31.081 --> 00:03:33.180
total darkness and silence,

55
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.750
and I knew what was happening to me.

56
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.600
I was faced with death. I tried to move my body, but I couldn't.

57
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.350
Then I started hearing whispering voices of the

58
00:03:49.351 --> 00:03:54.210
girls around me. Mother helped me. God, help me.

59
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.190
I remember those voices, belonging to certain people.

60
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.210
They still ring in my ears from time to time.

61
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.340
All of a sudden from behind the somebody shook my left

62
00:04:08.341 --> 00:04:11.880
shoulder and with the male voice said,

63
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.530
don't give up kick, keep moving, keep kicking, keep pushing.

64
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.840
I'm trying to free you. And he helped me.

65
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.120
And he also suggested that I should crawl towards

66
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.290
the direction where the sound way what's coming through.

67
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.220
So I crawled up in the total darkness.

68
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.320
I began to see some moving object approaching me

69
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.190
for a while.

70
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.660
I couldn't say what those black things want,

71
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.490
but then I could tell there were injured human beings.

72
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.190
They didn't look like human beings.

73
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.480
I'll tell you their hair was standing up. Like,

74
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.820
why are the wires standing up?

75
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.700
And they were covered with blood and skins were scorched

76
00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.910
blackened and, uh,

77
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.480
skiing and flesh were hanging from their bones.

78
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.480
And part of the bodies are missing.

79
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.860
And some people, I know this is gross,

80
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.420
but carrying their eyeballs in the eye in the hands.

81
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.910
And they were slowly shuffling from the center part of the

82
00:05:35.911 --> 00:05:36.744
city,

83
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.820
but they collapsed onto the ground when they collapse their

84
00:05:41.821 --> 00:05:43.230
stomach burst up.

85
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.790
And the intestine stretching out this kind of

86
00:05:47.791 --> 00:05:49.380
situation I witnessed.

87
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.180
<v 2>And that summer seven class mentioned that we were arrested,</v>

88
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.160
trying to use the public library. That was a experience.

89
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.000
<v 3>Later on, we saved, we own laboratory. Don't have to move it to you this,</v>

90
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.490
and we'd be, we began the process. And that process led us to, uh,

91
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.690
we ended up going to Washington when Dr. King gave the speech that I have a

92
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:14.600
dream speech. And most of us were there. I had the, uh,

93
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:19.580
the honor of having been jailed and I became free of jails and death at

94
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:23.840
that time. And what most people don't realize the context of that speech,

95
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:29.180
the day he gave that speech from Texas across the floor left to

96
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:33.290
Maryland. We couldn't use a single public toilet in a state Capitol.

97
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.870
They gave this speech, we couldn't buy screaming holiday at Howard Johnson.

98
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.420
We couldn't buy [inaudible] counterfeited black and Latinos.

99
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.860
So I had to sit behind, not appeal debits to the American wheelchair basis.

100
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.430
We lived under the degradation of apartheid. So it was,

101
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.040
I didn't have to Google as it was. I was living it.

102
00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.370
<v 4>If you're going to now go back to 9th of October last year,</v>

103
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.810
uh, you were on the school bus. Um, what,

104
00:07:05.811 --> 00:07:08.770
what can you remember from that, that happened or what happened?

105
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.130
<v 5>Well, I don't remember that incident and we will say you're lucky.</v>

106
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.640
<v 4>What's the last thing you remember?</v>

107
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:21.250
<v 5>I was going back home from school and on that day was my Pakistan studies</v>

108
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:23.320
paper. We were having exams that we,

109
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.860
and I was really worried on that day.

110
00:07:26.861 --> 00:07:31.690
It was a sad day because I usually try to get first positioned in my class

111
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.200
and to defeat all my friends in the class and be on the top.

112
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:40.030
And I was really worried about my exam paper. So when I was happy on the day,

113
00:07:40.031 --> 00:07:43.720
quite happy because my favorite went very well on their day. And

114
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:47.410
Oh, we are going back home and, uh,

115
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:52.060
I could see the life was just like normal seeing those people on the road side.

116
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.930
And usually we have a lot of men on the road side, no women at all.

117
00:07:55.931 --> 00:07:58.240
And if you see a woman, she would be wearing a burka.

118
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:03.490
And I thought that I sit in the school bus,

119
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.290
I was going back home,

120
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.560
but I didn't know that the journey was never going to end.

121
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.360
And I also didn't know that I'm never going to go back to my home

122
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.410
and the journey finished. And I woke up in a hospital in Birmingham.

123
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.890
<v 4>Th there was, there was a man coming into the bus, right?</v>

124
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.260
Yes. And he was asking for you.

125
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.400
<v 5>So there were two men.</v>

126
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:29.980
We will call them boys because they were in their twenties.

127
00:08:29.981 --> 00:08:30.814
They were quite young.

128
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.870
And my friend told me the story and some other witnesses as well.

129
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.700
One of the boy, he stopped the school when,

130
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:44.530
and he was talking to the driver. My sister is behind it. I want to, uh,

131
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.500
I want to meet the principal of the school, making excuses,

132
00:08:47.501 --> 00:08:50.470
just to keep him busy for a, for a while. And the other boy,

133
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.880
he came at the back of the bus and he

134
00:08:55.470 --> 00:09:00.000
who is Malala, all the girls sitting in their school bus

135
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.930
and my school friends, they all looked at me. Some of them didn't,

136
00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:07.950
but some of them did.

137
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.520
And they could not even imagine what was happening at that time,

138
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.220
because you are living a happy life.

139
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:18.750
And you're thinking about your exam and your homework and everything.

140
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:23.400
And then suddenly things change. So when he asked, who is Malala,

141
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.190
I could not answer him because he didn't give me time.

142
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.590
And when he recognized me, because I was not wearing, uh,

143
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.320
I was not covering my face. All the girls were covering their faces,

144
00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:39.210
but my face he could see. So that's why, uh, he shot me in the bullet,

145
00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:42.570
hit me right here on the left side of my forehead.

146
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.830
And it just went down through my neck and into the left shoulder.

147
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.760
And when I fell down, I fell in the lap of my best friend Winneba.

148
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.740
And when he told me that, when that boy asked,

149
00:09:55.741 --> 00:10:00.540
who is Malala, you didn't say anything, neither did you cry,

150
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.550
nor did you scream. She said,

151
00:10:02.551 --> 00:10:07.320
you just only forced my hand and you just you're like squeezing

152
00:10:07.321 --> 00:10:11.550
it. And then you just, in the next few seconds, you just fell in my lap.

153
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.680
And then you're, my ear was bleeding.

154
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.470
And especially my year in this part was bleeding.

155
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:21.750
And the other two bullets hit my other friends, school,

156
00:10:21.751 --> 00:10:23.730
friends, kindness, and Shazia.

157
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.690
And then suddenly those boys ran away.

158
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:33.020
<v 6>Well, the war, Rob, the call of my family, you know,</v>

159
00:10:33.021 --> 00:10:36.440
it's rubbed the soul in my village.

160
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.540
The first time I witnessed war,

161
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.430
I thought the world was ending because I used to hear my mother telling me the

162
00:10:43.431 --> 00:10:45.170
world is going to end someday.

163
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:50.180
And so in seeing people running different direction, you know,

164
00:10:50.181 --> 00:10:54.260
you see animals even confused, big bombs, dropping ground check,

165
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.750
and like there's so much confusion.

166
00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.380
And I got used to seeing people die. I still live in,

167
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:05.510
have the scars of the Wars. The first time it happened, even my leg got burned.

168
00:11:05.511 --> 00:11:09.440
I fell, uh, a bike fell on me and I was on fire.

169
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.190
So the war reached the cough, my family.

170
00:11:13.191 --> 00:11:17.690
So my aunt has died during the war, including my mom,

171
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.970
all my uncles later, when I get to hear more stories were claimed by the war.

172
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.150
And I think festered and

173
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.650
we'd keep running from one place to another.

174
00:11:30.651 --> 00:11:34.670
And then we had to walk to Ethiopia. You had to walk to Ethiopia. That's a,

175
00:11:34.671 --> 00:11:37.790
that's a very long walk, was a long cause month.

176
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:41.930
A lot of kids died on the way some died of starvation crossing the rivers.

177
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.540
Uh, there were beaten by hippopotamus, you know, hippopotamus don't eat,

178
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.540
but they're very territorial. So when you cross the river,

179
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.920
they able to smash somebody too.

180
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:58.690
<v 2>And crocodiles were eating them some who don't know how to swim, get drown.</v>

the scuffle caffeinated coming from there.

198
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.920
They don't come from so

199
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.450
[inaudible]. So the first time.

200
00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.720
<v 2>Well, then to scan some</v>

201
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:53.000
[inaudible] Dr. Mengele some, uh

202
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:56.103
[inaudible]

203
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.020
and all that you were in back in 72,

204
00:14:01.021 --> 00:14:05.400
you were in Hanoi when the bombs fell really hard. Can you,

205
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:06.870
can you take us back there for a moment?

206
00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.630
<v 7>Well, when I went,</v>

207
00:14:09.631 --> 00:14:13.680
it was as a peace group to meet with a peace group

208
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:15.420
in Hanoi,

209
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:20.040
where they were no North Vietnamese communist party,

210
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:25.770
um, but wanted to talk, you know, just to talk. And we went over,

211
00:14:25.771 --> 00:14:30.570
there was a, uh, minister and a Maoist kid, uh, is,

212
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.240
um, uh, you know,

213
00:14:33.241 --> 00:14:37.650
a left-wing ex military and a four star

214
00:14:37.651 --> 00:14:41.970
general with us. And we got there.

215
00:14:41.971 --> 00:14:44.100
And all I can remember is the beginning.

216
00:14:44.101 --> 00:14:46.710
There had not been any bombing there for half a year.

217
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:52.040
So nobody was expecting the sound of this siren went off at our

218
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.480
second night, second, big dinner, no welcoming us.

219
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.450
And the siren went off and I'm thinking of,

220
00:14:59.451 --> 00:15:04.400
they must have these exercises all the time. And then we heard boom, boom,

221
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:08.420
and the distance. And, you know, for us, we didn't know what was happening,

222
00:15:08.421 --> 00:15:11.870
really. The Vietnamese did, but they were stunned. Um,

223
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.680
but they got us down in bomb shelter. Um,

224
00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:18.200
and I remember in the bomb shelter,

225
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.880
that's where I understood about my own

226
00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.340
mortality. I mean,

227
00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:30.200
I kind of was so frightened and a lot of times I'm not frightened.

228
00:15:30.201 --> 00:15:33.860
I do this stuff. And if they come, you'll get very calm,

229
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:39.740
but you can't be calm in that atheist agnostics. Everybody's saying, dear God,

230
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.560
please don't let that bomb land on me. You know,

231
00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.920
then afterwards you feel guilty because it fell on somebody else. I mean,

232
00:15:45.921 --> 00:15:50.810
it's not a win-win situation. It was, it was pretty terrible.

233
00:15:50.811 --> 00:15:54.170
I had a moment when I decided this passage,

234
00:15:54.171 --> 00:15:56.420
this is not going to run to the bomb shelter.

235
00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:01.400
So the next time the siren went off,

236
00:16:01.401 --> 00:16:05.660
I was walking very slowly. There was explosion really, really near,

237
00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:08.810
and everybody started running and I ran so fast.

238
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:13.250
I just lost all my brilliant self image I had. And I just up,

239
00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:14.390
I couldn't get there fast,

240
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:17.600
other trampled people trying to get to the bomb shelter.

241
00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:19.593
<v 2>Th this,</v>

242
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:24.190
this story is also famous for what then happened when you didn't have any food.

243
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:27.690
I mean, you had to take extreme measures. Yes.

244
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.310
When did you decide to do that?

245
00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.800
<v 8>It's um, I think our history, our stories,</v>

246
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:38.980
a very interesting from that point of view for us,

247
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.930
it was only the, the only thing we could do.

248
00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:46.390
And it's so strange to try and think I

249
00:16:46.391 --> 00:16:49.840
would do it. I wouldn't do it. You don't looking at that TV show,

250
00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.330
sitting on an Archer, reading and newspaper,

251
00:16:52.331 --> 00:16:55.930
reading a book it's completely different. Over there. You change,

252
00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:00.910
you change into the best of yourself or dependent on the point of view.

253
00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.790
You descend to a worst of yourself as a human being,

254
00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:06.160
but the pressures are completely,

255
00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:11.050
and I haven't had any pressures or any problems in the last

256
00:17:11.051 --> 00:17:14.980
38 years. Nothing that can compare to that. After 10 days,

257
00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:19.180
we heard on a small transistor radio that the search had been abandoned.

258
00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.830
We were left at 5,000 meters, no clothes, no food, no water,

259
00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:28.660
no rescue. What do you do? You change? You're another person.

260
00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.530
You turn yourself into a survival machine.

261
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.920
<v 2>Is the decision to, to, to.</v>

262
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.680
<v 8>Eat human flesh.</v>

263
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.830
<v 2>And it was, it was a source of conflict in the group,</v>

264
00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.620
or no conflict did all of you eat or.

265
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.010
<v 8>No conflict because, um,</v>

266
00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:53.100
if there's a fire in this studio here, we run to the door.

267
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:58.200
You willing run to where there is a wall over there on a limit situation like

268
00:17:58.201 --> 00:17:58.650
that.

269
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:02.880
All the brain goes to a different wavelength and all the information that you

270
00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:05.820
have, you are lost. You are abandoned to die. You are going to die.

271
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:09.390
Freezing looking at the eyes of your friends, sitting down here, you change.

272
00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:11.040
You're a different human being.

273
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.960
I normally thought falling to a funnel and one comes out.

274
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.580
We have to survive. We have to eat.

275
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:22.020
The only things to eat are the dead boys of her friends. And it's so easy.

276
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:22.883
Once you're there,

277
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:29.070
it was harder to fight to get water. There's no water at 5,000 meters.

278
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.170
<v 2>Th there was, there was an ambulance as well. Wasn't there?</v>

279
00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:35.240
<v 8>Yeah. The, the mountains are,</v>

280
00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.430
are a very strong open-end, but there,

281
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.570
there are through what they are. There are mountains, you know,

282
00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:49.160
men do not belong there. And two and a half weeks after the plane crash,

283
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:53.600
there was a huge avalanche because it snows, snows gets on top of the mountains,

284
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:54.950
then falls by gravity.

285
00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:00.080
And we were right under the outlets and it varied

286
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.390
27 of us and it killed eight.

287
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:06.830
<v 2>And then you were 16 left.</v>

288
00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:12.320
<v 8>Yeah. Then three, four more that I, and then, uh, I had to get out of there.</v>

289
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.810
I walked out with a friend, I say, walked out.

290
00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.740
We tricked 70 kilometers, 10 days and a half.

291
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:24.050
We crossed the whole land, this wrong things on, on foot with street shoes,

292
00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.153
with street shoes.

293
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:27.500
<v 2>Um, I mean,</v>

294
00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:33.020
it experts say that this is almost humanly impossible to cross the

295
00:19:33.021 --> 00:19:37.040
Andes mountains like that. Yeah. Um, why do you think you made it?

296
00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.400
<v 8>Because I wanted to see my father. Uh,</v>

297
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:47.420
I knew that he was back at home, having lost his wife,

298
00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:52.130
his daughter, his son, and we were a normal family,

299
00:19:52.131 --> 00:19:54.980
but I knew he couldn't sleep. He couldn't work. He couldn't think,

300
00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:56.173
and I was alive.

301
00:19:56.270 --> 00:20:00.950
And the love for my father gave me the strength to go over those mountains.
