00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:08.520

he retired from boxing and is now fighting the Corona virus as the mayor of

4
00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:17.940

Kiev is slowly opening up again after a strict lockdown

11

<v 0>And that was, that was, that was, uh,</v>

26
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.050
that was early on that you had a contact with the VU Hong, right?

27
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.100

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.520
uh, Justin China is, can be wall a wide problem.

31
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.560
And after that, we, uh, followings is strict rules.

32
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.480
This rules have huge, uh, economic impact.

33
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.730
Uh, and the nobody wants to do that, but it's right now,

34
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.570
the question from one side economy, from another side,

35
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.680
life of the people, life is much more important.

36
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.300
Not everybody, by the way, understands this rules.

37
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.470
They criticize me, uh, because, uh,

38
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.610
they not happy, uh, with, uh, this rules,

39
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.750
the cause the Creek or the garden schools, public transportation.

40
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.410
But after that, uh, mom's letter,

41
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.810
we see the terrible pictures from Italy.

42
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.610
Everybody understand how dangerous Yvette and,

43
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.590
uh, they stopped criticized. They, uh, starting to sink,

44
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:16.330
he bought his health, his life and nobody wants to die.

45
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.430
It's my opinion. We do it exactly in right time and vet,

46
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:25.330
why the numbers of sick people in our hometown most are high.

47
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.850
<v 0>And, and, and do you, do you, do you fully trust the numbers?</v>

48
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.730
<v 1>Uh, I trust the numbers because with doesn't have a idea to hide</v>

49
00:03:35.731 --> 00:03:37.350
something. Uh,

50
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.030
and right now all a scientist in the waltz, uh,

51
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.480
working very hard to find medication,

52
00:03:45.481 --> 00:03:50.100
to find the injection, a vaccine against this, uh,

53
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.250
the sick let's see, we, we have to,

54
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.820
when the time it's our main goal right now.

55
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.780
<v 0>One of your most important fights has been the fight against corruption.</v>

56
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.340
How do you think that will be affected by the economical setback that that

57
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.653
happens now?

58
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.530
<v 1>Um, you know, what the we receive, we receive a stressor from,</v>

59
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.980
uh, from Soviet times.

60
00:04:15.981 --> 00:04:20.460
The system system is big and

61
00:04:20.461 --> 00:04:24.360
flexible and effective corrupt,

62
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.070
and, uh, it's very important to change the system.

63
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.400
And it's not easy system.

64
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.570
Don't want to change that why and, uh,

65
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.900
October this year will be next election.

66
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.150
I take apart, uh, already third time in,

67
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.860
uh, I will be candid that for, for the next election,

68
00:04:49.861 --> 00:04:53.790
because I want to continue this fight. And, uh,

69
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.540
I want to bring European standards of life to my country,

70
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.710
defend rights of the people, defend, uh,

71
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.410
people from, uh, economical,

72
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.950
economic impact and medical and bagged infection.

73
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.840
And a lot of challenges had a lot of challenges because in boxing you have

74
00:05:12.841 --> 00:05:16.170
one opponent, uh, in my position right now,

75
00:05:16.171 --> 00:05:20.850
we have thousands of them. And, uh, you have to be in great shape.

76
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.810
You have to have spirit, you have, uh,

77
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.040
you need vision and, uh, it's very important.

78
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.960
You have to wheel to win this, not easy fight.

79
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.090
<v 0>You are a professional boxer, three times world champion boxer.</v>

80
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.930
Um,

81
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.880
and I wonder fighting this invisible enemy as a virus is,

82
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.520
uh, can you still, um,

83
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.420
can you still use your experience as a boxer when you,

84
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.850
when you plan a strategy against the virus.

85
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.460
<v 1>It's totally different. You know, what is, uh,</v>

86
00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.200
I use my personal experiences, uh, citizens of Ukraine,

87
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.090
exactly the same situation we have in 1986 is

88
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:13.040
Chernobyl explosion. Um, uh,

89
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.330
nobody see, nobody smelled that, uh,

90
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.240
but we have impact little bit later from,

91
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:24.110
from radiation and exactly the same. You,

92
00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.850
you doesn't see the, the virus, uh, right now after the winter,

93
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:33.590
everybody wants to go into the street. Everybody wants to make a picnic and,

94
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.830
uh, spent time together with a friends,

95
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.940
but very important following the rules. And, uh,

96
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.240
I deliver as information, uh, to everyone.

97
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.700
Please be responsible.

98
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.810
<v 0>Well, when you, when you mentioned the channel bill, uh, is it true that your,</v>

99
00:06:51.811 --> 00:06:55.390
your father was a part of the team that had to deal with gentlemen?

100
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.530
<v 1>Yeah, from beginning,</v>

101
00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.490
my father was air force officer and from beginning from Phil's day,

102
00:07:00.491 --> 00:07:03.460
he spent a lot of time in Chernobyl and,

103
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.760
uh, yeah, he's died from, um, uh,

104
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.010
um, uh, from Chernobyl, uh, impact a little bit later.

105
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.100

108
00:07:26.711 --> 00:07:31.270
boxers, and I, I guess that she spent a lot of time worrying about her sons.

109
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.900
Uh, but now with the Corona, I think it's, it's you,

110
00:07:34.901 --> 00:07:37.630
that should worry about her being in the risk group. Isn't it?

111

He was an early inspiration. Was there?

149
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:20.990
I was 14 years old and actually it was Soviet time in

150
00:10:20.991 --> 00:10:23.930
1996. Uh,

151
00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:28.820
actually period striker came and we have a chance to, uh, to see,

152
00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.380
uh, the broadcasting from, from, from the West.

153
00:10:33.381 --> 00:10:35.870
And first time era in my life,

154
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:40.070
I saw the professional fight it's was fight. Uh,

155
00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:44.930
when Mike Tyson knocked his opponents out

156
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.710
and, uh,

157
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:50.590

158
00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:55.970

159
00:10:56.030 --> 00:11:00.440
I sit together with my friends and, uh, I promised to my friend, uh,

160
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:04.220

162
00:11:08.931 --> 00:11:11.240
everybody, everybody, um,

163
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.470

and skinny and to fight against the machine

165
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:23.450
against Mike dice. And nobody believed me.

166
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.450
But 15 years later as the status was mine, the same title,

167
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.910
what have Mike, Tyson's the same title? What have Mohammed,

168
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.330
the Lee or Lennox Lewis. And, uh,

169
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.830

173
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:59.500
important to have a goal in life. It's very important to fight for your goals.

uh, nothing is impossible.

176
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:12.100
