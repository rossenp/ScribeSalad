00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>Stormy Daniels. Welcome to the show.</v>

2
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.520
[inaudible] first of all, you're you're you're in the news again. Uh, how,

3
00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:18.840
how do you feel about this story? Just never going away.

4
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.780
<v 1>Um, it's getting tiresome. Um,</v>

5
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.160
it just seems like there's always something new coming up. Um,

6
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.140
part of me says I'm ready for it to be over, but the other part of me says like,

7
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.700
I'm going to keep fighting until I get what I want. So what do you want, uh,

8
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.110
to be proven,

9
00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:43.940
not to be a liar for the people that bullied me and broke the law to be

10
00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:44.774
held accountable.

11
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.850
<v 0>Democrats in Congress. They want to use this story to,</v>

12
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.620
to investigate the president. Would you like to testify in Congress?

13
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.130
Absolutely. Do you think they want to?

14
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.430
<v 1>Um, I think some do and I think some are afraid that I can't hold</v>

15
00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:07.010
my own, but I definitely can because I have nothing to hide.

16
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.850
<v 0>If they won't ask you to testify. What, what are your thoughts on that?</v>

17
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.040
<v 1>Part of me says,</v>

18
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.150
wants to say that I have to trust the legal team and their decisions.

19
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.560
And the other part,

20
00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:22.820
I think we'll always wonder if I was someone different or had a different

21
00:01:22.821 --> 00:01:26.300
profession. If I would be given the opportunity.

22
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.680
<v 0>You, you had this profession also,</v>

23
00:01:30.681 --> 00:01:34.070
when you met Donald Trump for the first time you met him,

24
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.480
uh, some golf arrangement, the golf tournament. Can you,

25
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.830
can you take us back to the two when you met him alone? At the first time.

26
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.790
<v 1>It was 2006. It was, uh,</v>

27
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.040
after the golf tournament that day and he asked me to

28
00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:56.210
dinner and I thought it was very funny and I wasn't going to go.

29
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.600
And then I was on the phone with my friend and, uh, he was like,

30
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.530
you have to like what a cool thing to be able to, you know,

31
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.770
pick his brain because he's such a famous businessman at the time.

32
00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:11.450
And he wanted to meet at his hotel and then we were going to go down to

33
00:02:11.451 --> 00:02:13.760
dinner. I assumed. And when I got there,

34
00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:16.610
it was pretty clear that he didn't want to leave the room.

35
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.340
Why was that so clear? Because he was in his pajamas.

36
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.720
What kinds of Gemma's black silk ones.

37
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.600
<v 0>I see. Yeah. That's not a dinner outfit, that's it? No, nobody else there.</v>

38
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.550
<v 1>Uh, nobody else was there. He had a bodyguard,</v>

39
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:35.420
but he stayed outside the room in the hallway. Did you comment on that pajamas?

40
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.530
Of course I did. I made fun of him. I told him, go put some pants on and he did,

41
00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:43.010
he went and got dressed and we started talking and he showed me the room and,

42
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.000
uh, was, began the conversation, very, uh,

43
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.520
conceded talking about himself and I was hungry. So I was a little,

44
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.410
a little angry.

45
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.060
And finally I just had enough of his bragging and put him in his place.

46
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.790
I was like, you're so arrogant. Like,

47
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.140
do you ever ask anybody anything about themselves and he kind.

48
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.450
<v 0>Of, how does he respond to that? I.</v>

49
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.170
<v 1>Think he was shocked that someone talked to him like that and he was very taken</v>

50
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:15.010
back and, uh, he laughed and that's when the whole spanking thing happened.

51
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:16.300
Of course. And, um.

52
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.300
<v 0>Spanked him with a magazine with himself on the cover. Yeah. But,</v>

53
00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:23.130
but you insist this was not a sexual?

54
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.590
<v 1>No, it wasn't. It wasn't at all. He was like, and he was sober. Oh, of course.</v>

55
00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:31.410
Yeah. He doesn't drink at all. Yeah. There was no alcohol.

56
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.180
<v 0>Did you see from the outside? It's a weird.</v>

57
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.850
<v 1>But it wasn't sexual after that,</v>

58
00:03:35.851 --> 00:03:39.030
he actually kind of was shocked that I was,

59
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.620
that I had done that and we sat down and had a pretty long conversation.

60
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.340
<v 0>W what was that about? I mean, where could you meet? Uh.</v>

61
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.050
<v 1>Tell me about the business, uh, side of the adult business. Like,</v>

62
00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:55.560
did we get royalties? Are there unions? How do we get paid?

63
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.660
Do we get paid by the hour per, like,

64
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.270
it was all very intelligent business conversations.

65
00:04:00.271 --> 00:04:04.590
He was talking about his television show and a vacation. He went on,

66
00:04:04.591 --> 00:04:06.540
it was all very normal stuff. I mean.

67
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.550
<v 0>So w when did you realize that this was not just a business</v>

68
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.810
meeting?

69
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.500
<v 1>When I came out of the bathroom and he was taking his clothes off and was on the</v>

70
00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:18.030
bed? I had no warning at all.

71
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.860
What did you feel that just kind of,

72
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.910
I felt at first I was shocked, like genuinely startled.

73
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.290
Cause I didn't expect him to be.

74
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.070
<v 0>There.</v>

75
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.280
So you just needed to use the bathroom and then you came out and he was on the

76
00:04:32.281 --> 00:04:34.920
bed totally naked. Or though in his underwear.

77
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.780
<v 1>He was in his underwear. And, uh, and then it was just like, Oh no,</v>

78
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.510
what have I gotten myself into? Because I didn't see it coming at all.

79
00:04:45.511 --> 00:04:48.120
We hadn't discussed it. It wasn't implied.

80
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.180
<v 0>Nothing. This was the only time you had sex with him, right? Yes.</v>

81
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.070
Did he ever ask you to keep quiet about it? Nope. Did he,

82
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.480
did he talk about his family at all?

83
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.460
<v 1>Really? Uh, only the first, like 10 minutes. I was in the room.</v>

84
00:05:02.461 --> 00:05:05.730
Like he showed me a picture of his son and I mean, it was very brief.

85
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.360
Like he didn't really talk, he talked about his daughter. Um,

86
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.780
but not after that, never again, like, I even went to meet him at,

87
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.550
at his office in New York.

88
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.970
Like I walked straight through the lobby and they had my name and I've been up

89
00:05:17.971 --> 00:05:21.910
in his office at Trump tower. Like he didn't seem to care. W w w.

90
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.940
<v 0>What did he say about his daughter? He.</v>

91
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.790
<v 1>Said that, uh, I think he said that she was starting a clothing company here.</v>

92
00:05:26.791 --> 00:05:30.960
So I spent so long and later when I was talking about being a writer and

93
00:05:30.961 --> 00:05:35.040
director, he told me that I reminded him of her, that I was smart and beautiful.

94
00:05:35.041 --> 00:05:35.874
Like his daughter.

95
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.790
<v 0>Ivanka? Yes. That's is the problem, but never,</v>

96
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.850
never really worried about millennia? No.

97
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.640
What are your thoughts about millennia? Um, I don't really have any, did,

98
00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:51.540
did you feel, did you have a bad conscience? No.

99
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.730
<v 1>I wasn't doing anything wrong. I wasn't married.</v>

100
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.890
I don't know what their arrangement was for all.

101
00:05:55.891 --> 00:05:59.060
I know she was into it in 2015.

102
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.710
<v 0>You signed an NDA that, that,</v>

103
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.890
that should prevent you from sitting here now.

104
00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.070
How, why did you do that? First of all.

105
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.340
<v 1>Initially, a friend of mine, you know, it wasn't a secret, like everybody knew,</v>

106
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.150
like everybody in my life knew, like when it was happening, I used to call,

107
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.580
he used to call it, I put him on speaker phone and we'd make fun of him.

108
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.660
Friends went with me to see him. Like, it was not a secret. Yeah. By.

109
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.910
<v 0>Then it was only internet as well. It wasn't, yeah, it was.</v>

110
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.930
<v 1>Everywhere. And it wasn't going to talk about it. It's going to, I mean,</v>

111
00:06:31.931 --> 00:06:36.220
I didn't think anybody cared and a friend of mine who was an attorney

112
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.170
pointed out that if he got the Republican nomination, that I could be in danger,

113
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.350
that, and I was like, what are you talking about? Like, what do you mean?

114
00:06:44.351 --> 00:06:45.640
And he said, well,

115
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.620
you realize you could be driving home right now and being a C and be in a single

116
00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:53.230
car accident. Or you could overdose tonight. I was like,

117
00:06:53.231 --> 00:06:54.850
I don't drive either like exactly.

118
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.880
Or there's a gas leak in your house and it explodes.

119
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.980
And no one will ever think about it, but if it comes out,

120
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.600
then they can't do anything basically. Cause they'll,

121
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.130
it would be too obvious. And then the story came out to get like resurfaced.

122
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.090
And I was offered a bunch of money to go on and tell it, and I didn't want to,

123
00:07:16.091 --> 00:07:17.170
and I didn't want my now,

124
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.640
now I was married and my husband didn't know it.

125
00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.390
Not like I hit it. It's just, that happened four years before I even met him.

126
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.680
And do you tell every person you date, who everybody you were with before?

127
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.180
Especially if it was that? No.

128
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.970
<v 0>So it's hard to find the right timing for that.</v>

129
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.840
<v 1>Isn't, by the way I did something orange,</v>

130
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:48.220
like there's no good way to talk about that. Like,

131
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.890
you know, and, uh,

132
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:56.020
so I remember that they were going to have me on good morning America and

133
00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.300
I was very nervous. I was like,

134
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:02.410
I did not want everybody to know about this because for the record I've been

135
00:08:02.411 --> 00:08:04.930
with way, way hotter celebrities. And I was like,

136
00:08:04.931 --> 00:08:08.740
why couldn't I have been one of them? Like, why does it have to be that one?

137
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.810
And, uh, and then the night before they offered me the NDA or, you know,

138
00:08:13.811 --> 00:08:16.600
and I was like, well, this is perfect because there's an actual record of it.

139
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.750
So they can't kill me. Like nothing bad can happen.

140
00:08:19.751 --> 00:08:24.490
There's a like actual record. And I didn't ask for the money I, to this day.

141
00:08:24.491 --> 00:08:27.130
I always wonder how he came up with that number. Cause.

142
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.470
<v 0>I mean, no.</v>

143
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.540
<v 1>I just said whatever. I didn't even question it.</v>

144
00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:35.020
<v 0>How was the signing done? I mean, was it a car?</v>

145
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.610
It was with just you and your lawyer?

146
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.200
<v 1>Uh, yeah. And one witness and I was fine with saying nothing.</v>

147
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:49.030
And then like the story kept like coming up and I just wouldn't say

148
00:08:49.031 --> 00:08:52.090
anything. And then they asked me to lie

149
00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.970
and the first statement kind of worded to where it was like,

150
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.550
I didn't have an ongoing affair and I didn't have an affair.

151
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.550
<v 0>But, but how did they ask you to lie?</v>

152
00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.030
<v 1>Cohen called my attorney and they called me and said,</v>

153
00:09:05.031 --> 00:09:07.580
we need her to sign this statement. And I said,

154
00:09:07.581 --> 00:09:10.100
I wasn't comfortable with doing that. And my attorney was like, well, it's just,

155
00:09:10.101 --> 00:09:13.160
you know, just kind of do this. And I was like, fine. And I did it.

156
00:09:13.161 --> 00:09:14.420
And then a couple of weeks later,

157
00:09:14.421 --> 00:09:17.390
they called again and wanted a more specific statement saying that like,

158
00:09:17.391 --> 00:09:20.930
I never slept with him. I didn't know him. And I was like, I'm not gonna lie.

159
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.160
And they came to my hotel room when I was alone. And they said to me,

160
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:28.670
you're going to sign this or something bad could happen to your family.

161
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.900
You don't want to be audited. Do you? Who were they? Keith Davidson,

162
00:09:32.901 --> 00:09:37.610
the attorney. And, uh, a man, I didn't know. And the girl who was like,

163
00:09:37.611 --> 00:09:39.800
had kind of put the deal together that I don't work with anymore.

164
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.460
And so I didn't know what to do. So I signed it, but I signed my name wrong,

165
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.860
but it specifically said in the NDA that from that date forward,

166
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.700
they couldn't contact me at all and I couldn't contact them.

167
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:57.320
And they kept contacting me. They contacted me four times and asked me to lie.

168
00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:01.010
They kept pushing me. And I said, no, you can't do this.

169
00:10:01.011 --> 00:10:05.210
They broke the NDA first. And then Michael Cohen shopped a book. And in the,

170
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.070
um, description of what he was trying to shop it specifically said, Oh,

171
00:10:10.071 --> 00:10:11.450
how I covered the presidents,

172
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:16.100
but on this and this and this and the $130,000 payment to stormy Daniels.

173
00:10:16.101 --> 00:10:20.090
And I was like, what? Like, I can't defend myself, but he could shop a book.

174
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.780
And I was like, okay, that's strike five. Now I'm going to talk.

175
00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:28.700
<v 0>That day. When the story broke, how was that for you.</v>

176
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:33.140
<v 1>When it first happened? Uh, obviously there were reporters at the door and,</v>

177
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.881
uh, layers,

178
00:10:34.881 --> 00:10:37.550
like news trucks parked out on the street and they were trying to talk to the

179
00:10:37.551 --> 00:10:39.920
neighbors and they were trying to get pictures of my daughter.

180
00:10:39.921 --> 00:10:42.050
So she couldn't go outside and it was all over the news.

181
00:10:42.051 --> 00:10:44.180
So we couldn't turn on the TV. Um,

182
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.060
luckily my daughter was already homeschooled,

183
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.050
so she didn't have to be like taken out of school or anything like that. Um,

184
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:56.210
so it didn't disrupt her daily, like schooling and stuff like that, um,

185
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:59.263
in the, you know,

186
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.750
but she couldn't go out and ride her bike and stuff for awhile.

187
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.280
And my neighbors really kind of stepped up and told the press to get out,

188
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.300
get out of there. And like.

189
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.030
<v 0>Have you tried to explain? Um,</v>

190
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.600
she knows she's she knows she's she knows.

191
00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:16.870
<v 1>Who the president is. Um,</v>

192
00:11:16.871 --> 00:11:20.300
and it's funny because she recognizes him from home alone too.

193
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.000
<v 0>Like I was like, wait, what? I totally had forgotten who was in that.</v>

194
00:11:26.001 --> 00:11:28.940
But she was like, Oh, the guy from home alone two is the president.

195
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:33.110
I was like sad, but true.

196
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.850
I was like, if you only knew how ridiculous is actually. Yeah.

197
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.220
<v 1>Um, and then she knew,</v>

198
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:44.960
so she knows that he's the president and she knows that mommy used to know him

199
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:49.220
and people were very interested about how we used to hang out.

200
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.170
She doesn't know what sex is. So.

201
00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.230
<v 0>He's just a few blocks away. Now,</v>

202
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.170
as we sit here in New York and speak on something,

203
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:06.340
do do, do you remember that smell? Do you remember this smell old spice?

204
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.140
Was it really?

205
00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:16.330
But what is it? Is it like a, if you met him,

206
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.950
bumped into him on the streets outside here, what would you say to it?

207
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.550
I would just point and laugh. What are you? Yeah.

208
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:29.220
<v 1>I mean, I, he was never mean to me. I mean,</v>

209
00:12:29.221 --> 00:12:32.760
he misled me per se, actually. I don't even think he did. I think that, uh,

210
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:37.560
I think his intentions were actually pretty straight forward. Um,

211
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.470
but yeah, I will also say that.

212
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:44.940
I think that there's something wrong with him and he's degenerating a bit.

213
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.730
Cause like he can't even see before in complete sentences now.

214
00:12:47.731 --> 00:12:51.660
And I sat and talked to him for three hours and didn't want to jump out of a

215
00:12:51.661 --> 00:12:54.810
window after I spanked him. I mean, after I put him in his place.

216
00:12:55.410 --> 00:13:00.090
<v 0>Tolerable, but, but he, he wanted you in his show, right?</v>

217
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.070
That was, that was part of his agenda.

218
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.630
So do you think that he wanted to attempt to with that show?

219
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.360
Just show me a little bit, but I think he also saying.

220
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.930
<v 1>I think he also saw it as an opportunity to like,</v>

221
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.800
cause a stir because that's what he likes to do and be controversial.

222
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:20.370
<v 0>How was your life today? Um, interesting.</v>

223
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.880
Uh, are you still working in the same business?

224
00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.800
<v 1>I still work in the adult entertainment business. I still, um, I still stress.</v>

225
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:32.970
I still dance. Um, I write and direct movies.

226
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.260
I haven't in several months just because I've been so busy and I am getting

227
00:13:37.261 --> 00:13:41.640
older. Obviously 40 is very old porn years.

228
00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:42.483
Like dog years.

229
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:46.470
I probably died a long time ago and no one told me I'm like the Keith Richards

230
00:13:46.471 --> 00:13:50.940
of porn. So I've had to move on to doing some other things. Um,

231
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.960
obviously I wrote a book which I had been working on for years before this even

232
00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:55.560
happened.

233
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:59.130
<v 0>Your book is out in Scandinavia as well. Yes. Thank you so much. So many Daniel.</v>

234
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.530
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I

235
