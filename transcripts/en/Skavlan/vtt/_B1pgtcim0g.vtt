[inaudible] on the show. Thank you for coming. Thank you for having me. Eh,

3
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.570
I was, I was trying to, to, to explain something to some people, uh,

4
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.040
who, who you are, what your music was like. Ah,

5
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.650
but I think you'd do it better yourself. Uh, when, when,

6
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.410
when with huge, huge posters, uh, in the,

7
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.330
in the English tube tube stations where you describe yourself as the

8
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:44.010
Scottish Beyonce. Yeah.

9
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:52.460
[inaudible].

10
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.670
<v 1>Awesome. Wait, I know what we would all think him when I came out here,</v>

11
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.980
I saw you looking, Oh, and you're thinking, Oh,

12
00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:04.690
the single ladies, single ladies,

13
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.500
I put your hands up. You know what I mean? Um, so yeah, Scottish Beyonce,

14
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.210
and we're very similar.

15
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.680
<v 0>Very similar. Do I do, do you worry that you can become too similar?</v>

16
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.270
I bet. Yeah.

17
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.090
<v 1>We both love to sing and dance. Exactly. We're both beautiful.</v>

18
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.880
And we both love Jay Z. Excellent. But I'm definitely like she's married to him.

19
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.450
I'm not, unfortunately. Yeah, but uh, not yet. Not yet. Yeah,

20
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.370
no. Without a lot that manners will dissolve, but um, no, no, uh, yeah,

21
00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:44.480
I was just, she's just, I just love her and uh, I'm Scottish.

22
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.913
And uh.

23
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.970
<v 0>You know, when, when did you realize that you,</v>

24
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:54.170
you become a great big star? Uh.

25
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.170
<v 1>Oh, well usually, um,</v>

26
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.180
I see other people answer this question and they see like, you know,

27
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.890
a big gig for the dead and stuff. But for me it was something much more,

28
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.650
it was much more like small and minute, but it meant the world. And,

29
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.640
um, I was in Glasgow where I live and, um,

30
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.350
I was having a few lager lager beers.

31
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.780
I don't know how you see that in Swedish. Well, thank you.

32
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.210
And um, yeah,

33
00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:32.900
so I was drinking and then I was walking from one pub to another pub to meet my

34
00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:37.760
friend and I, um, I thought, Oh no, I need,

35
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.710
I'm gonna need to pee soon. So I run in to the neatest, um,

36
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.000
convenience store and I go in and I say, Oh, I'm really sorry,

37
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:51.230
but if you got a toilet I can use. And they said, um, I'm really sorry.

38
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.080
We don't have, um, we don't have a public toilet.

39
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.590
Cause most of the convenience stores where I'm from door and I says, Oh,

40
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.270
I'm really sorted. Okay. Nobody's and as I was going to leave, you know,

41
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.120
potentially enter the world to pee my pants,

42
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.720
that one of the guys who worked there stopped and says, wait a minute,

43
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.970
are you lose capacity? And I said, I looked at mint. Yeah,

44
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.880
there's me. And he says, we've got a staff toilet that you can use. No.

45
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.820
When you are given the opportunity to use a staff toilet,

46
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:27.280
that was once that was once for bed that

47
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.840
You truly become, you think.

48
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.923
<v 2>Truly.</v>

49
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.510
<v 0>[Inaudible]. Yeah, for sure. I mean, not,</v>

50
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.800
not in like parks and anything like that, but I can do it.

51
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.890
<v 1>FSR, FSR, staff, toilet and passenger.</v>

52
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.320
<v 0>So, so are you now, apart from the using the staff toilets, are you,</v>

53
00:04:04.321 --> 00:04:08.010
are you, are you able to enjoy the success?

54
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.680
I S you must not drink too much water because you know, what's going to happen.

55
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.820
<v 2>Oh, that's good.</v>

56
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.530
<v 0>Stuff. I saw. I saw some pictures on your, on your Instagram.</v>

57
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.911
Uh, this is,

58
00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:28.590
this is you getting to number one in America and you

59
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.790
really celebrate.

60
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.760
<v 1>I try and I try and have fun with it. I mean,</v>

61
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.750
I'm allergic to face paint so that wasn't the best thing that I could have done,

62
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.770
but it was funny at the time. Um, but yeah, I think you have to,

63
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.210
you have to enjoy it, but it's because math, Mark, and a philosophy as that,

64
00:04:45.211 --> 00:04:50.100
it's probably not going to last for very long. So just cause you're,

65
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.820
there's so many singles out there and I don't,

66
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.650
I've kind of squeezed by and no one's noticed yet like

67
00:04:58.651 --> 00:04:59.850
sort of thing. That's what I feel like.

68
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.240
<v 0>Is this what people call the imposter syndrome?</v>

69
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.850
<v 1>Yeah, I guess. Sure. I'm happy. I'm very happy. But, um, that we have,</v>

70
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.040
but, um, I think, you know, if it does, if it all stops to model,

71
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.780
I'll know that I enjoyed it while it was here and I'll be less than it will be.

72
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.490
Well, a mess, a few things. Yes. Well, I miss being able to, you know, uh,

73
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.020
being, given some free t-shirts of course. Well, while I'm asked, you know,

74
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.030
um, people maybe smiling at me in the street when I walk back, of course I will.

75
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.250
Um, while I'm S passing and staff toilets. Absolutely not. I mean, uh,

76
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.480
but I thank him as, yeah. I just, as long as I'm having fun,

77
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.550
if I have as much fun with it, no, I won't be very outlook.

78
00:05:44.551 --> 00:05:47.340
I know I'm not going to be sad when old disappears.

79
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.760
<v 0>You're the opposite. When do you have too much confidence.</v>

80
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.343
<v 2>And the bedroom</v>

81
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.233
[inaudible].

82
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.840
<v 1>Yeah. Cause that's usually I'm at home. Then I come in,</v>

83
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.570
usually people are sheepish bomb.

84
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:13.503
Here we go.

85
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.950
That's me mostly because I'm looking at myself in the mirror.

86
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.690
Oh yeah. And I think this is probably not, why should it be doing?

87
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.933
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

88
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.330
<v 0>Um, you, you are as.</v>

89
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.823
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

90
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.453
<v 1>Some pictures.</v>

91
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:41.770
Sometimes you can look in the eyes and sometimes I can look in the eyes,

92
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.720
but then, but then, then the mirroring is more interesting. Well,

93
00:06:46.721 --> 00:06:49.900
it's just, I can't see myself in their eyes

94
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.680
or maybe you can. Yeah.

95
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.310
<v 0>Um, you have, um, uh, you, you have this,</v>

96
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:10.870
um, background from Scotland as we can hear from your femur language.

97
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.990
Uh you're you're uh, Dallas.

98
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:18.640
<v 1>But that's a fresh Mungo. Yes. Salesforce mother is a nurse. She's a nurse.</v>

99
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:19.563
Indeed.

100
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:21.880
<v 0>Which phone do you, do you look the.</v>

101
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.430
<v 1>Most? Like which phone lists I look the most, like my mother,</v>

102
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.410
which is a shame for her,

103
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.910
because you don't want to look like your son,

104
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.520
especially not one that gets told he looks like meatloaf on the regular.

105
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.710
No, nothing wrong with meatloaf at all. Love meatloaf love him too much,

106
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.720
but he has 74 years old.

107
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.490
Is it really easy to get on meatloaf? Yeah.

108
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.600
<v 2>So people take you from me.</v>

109
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.900
<v 1>No people think meatloaf or Angela Merkel.</v>

110
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:06.880
<v 2>[Inaudible] that's fantastic.</v>

111
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:11.950
<v 1>Yeah. Well, I mean sure. For sure. She's she's a big team player. Yeah.</v>

112
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:17.230
Um, but yeah, you know, I don't, I'm not, I'm not pleased.

113
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:21.850
I'm not Angela Merkel. No, no meatloaf. Yeah. No meatloaf.

114
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.940
<v 0>So, but, but you, you still, you still live with.</v>

115
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.040
<v 1>Your parents. Yeah, I do. I do. Yes.</v>

116
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.760
<v 0>Is, is that, is that okay? I mean, nothing wrong with that.</v>

117
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:37.180
<v 1>Well, I go, when I go home, it's like, it's amazing. Cause I'm like,</v>

118
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:42.700
I get free. I'm all never home. Like if I'm lucky three days at a time,

119
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.830
I think this whole year I've probably been home for about two months after that

120
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.040
a month and a half max. So when I go home, it's like,

121
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.730
my mom I'm like the best thing ever. You know what I mean?

122
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:58.920
They forget all my flaws as a human being and they just think, Oh,

123
00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:03.060
it's our son and he's home. Cause there must be so much. And then my mom,

124
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:08.340
you know, washes my pants, my, I got my meals all cooked, ready to go,

125
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.210
which is lovely. And I don't pay any rent. You don't have to pay,

126
00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:16.560
I don't pay any rent at all. Yeah. Unless, unless the tax man asks.

127
00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.213
<v 0>I'm counting on.</v>

128
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.620
<v 1>No one I'm joking.</v>

129
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.003
<v 0>When did you get.</v>

130
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:30.430
<v 1>That voice? Well, when, you know, uh, you know,</v>

131
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.010
when you become, when a boy becomes a man

132
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.940
and you know yeah.

133
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.630
But they don't have good voices boys and man, it.

134
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.150
<v 0>Doesn't, it doesn't happen to all of us. Well.</v>

135
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.410
<v 1>Um, some of us, I mean only parts of it have happened to me.</v>

136
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:53.630
I'm still really upset about the don't steals and

137
00:09:53.631 --> 00:09:58.040
I'm hoping for, I'll be a late bloomer, but no. Yeah, sure.

138
00:09:58.041 --> 00:10:03.020
When I was doing pupil, not that puberty when I dead puberty, um,

139
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.470
that can, uh, you should try it if you have really good,

140
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.870
like a rasp in my voice,

141
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:13.310
but I never had it because I loved people like Joe Cocker and stuff like that.

142
00:10:13.311 --> 00:10:15.830
And, and the lovely raspy voices. I mean,

143
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.430
I've probably done some irreparable damage to my throat over the time,

144
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.040
but who cares? It needs that.

145
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:25.400
<v 0>Anyway, you have.</v>

146
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:31.190

147
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.130
