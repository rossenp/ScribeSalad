00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.000
<v 0>Uh, which phone do you find the hardest to follow yourself?</v>

2
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.670
<v 1>Probably the hardest one is to tell the truth, or at least not to lie.</v>

3
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.890
Why is it a constant challenge,

4
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.990
but because it's easy to use your speech in a way that pays off in the short

5
00:00:20.991 --> 00:00:24.830
term, and it's difficult to contend with the conflict. That's inevitable.

6
00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:27.920
If you try to do things in a straightforward manner,

7
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.970
because that produces short-term conflict, it produces long-term peace,

8
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.890
which is a huge advantage,

9
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.000
but it's very tempting in the short term to

10
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.870
circumvent the problem and pretend that it's not there.

11
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.910
<v 0>Do you sometimes avoid telling the truth just to be kind?</v>

12
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.860
<v 1>Um, I try to be as kind as possible, but no.</v>

13
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.440
<v 0>Good.</v>

14
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.520
<v 1>I'm tempted to,</v>

15
00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.260
because I'm fundamentally an agreeable person surprisingly enough,

16
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.240
but I'm convinced that it's better to face things when they need

17
00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:08.600
to be faced and to get to the bottom of things. Even though that's, it's been,

18
00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:12.540
of course you have to be constituted in that manner. If you're going to be,

19
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.800
uh, an useful psychotherapist, because you can't let things go,

20
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.130
they have to be dealt with just like they have to be dealt with. If,

21
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.540
if you're a medical professional, it's unpleasant to sit,

22
00:01:25.541 --> 00:01:26.930
tell someone that they have an illness,

23
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.630
it hurts their feelings and it upsets them. But if you don't deal with it,

24
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:37.370
then perhaps they die and psychological issues can be of the same

25
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.043
significance.

26
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.970
<v 0>You talk, you talk sometimes about weak men.</v>

27
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.350
Uh, why are weak men such a problem?

28
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.420
<v 1>Well, weak people are a problem in general. And I don't mean physically weak.</v>

29
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.930
I mean,

30
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.250
cowardly let's say and deceitful because I'm thinking it more in terms of moral

31
00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:02.240
weakness. Well, there's a variety of reasons is first of all,

32
00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:04.640
if you can't support your own weight,

33
00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.350
let's say then someone else has to do it and that's not good.

34
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.680
And then if you don't make your pathway,

35
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.300
if you don't pick a forthright and useful and noble pathway through life,

36
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.190
then you'll become bitter and too hurt by the

37
00:02:22.191 --> 00:02:23.360
tragedy of existence.

38
00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:26.570
And then you tend to seek your revenge wherever you can get it.

39
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.340
And that's not good. So it's a, it's a mistake on all fronts.

40
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.590
It's not good for you. It's not good for your family.

41
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.050
It's not good for the community. Um,

42
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.440
it's certainly not a good medium to long-term strategy because life is very,

43
00:02:39.441 --> 00:02:42.800
very difficult and you have to be prepared for that.

44
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.510
And I had to

45
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.393
watch her the other night.

46
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.380
He was at my lecture in Oslo and he wrote me a letter. He was a 17 year old boy.

47
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.770
And he said that he, that my work had been very helpful to him. His father died.

48
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.220
<v 2>Suddenly about six months before,</v>

49
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.550
and he found his dad when he was dying and was very,

50
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:09.550
very shocked and horrified and hurt by what had happened.

51
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.250
And I had recommended on my YouTube lectures,

52
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:16.690
that one thing you could aim for was to be the strongest

53
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.930
person at your father's funeral.

54
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.150
And so that's what he did.

55
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.580
And he helped his mom and he wrote a 200 word eulogy and got through it.

56
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.080
And so good for him that strength and necessary.

57
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.790
It's a terrible thing that happened,

58
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:37.480
but he did everything he could not to make it any worse than it had to be the

59
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:38.130
DNA.

60
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.890
<v 0>I see that showing weakness can be a strength too.</v>

61
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.150
<v 2>Not weakness, vulnerability. And that's,</v>

62
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.700
that's a whole different thing to admit, to, uh,

63
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.180
to admit to the fact that you're vulnerable. That's a form of courage.

64
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.620
That's not a form of weakness,

65
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.340
but that leads you to take whatever steps are necessary to deal with that

66
00:03:56.341 --> 00:03:59.670
properly. It isn't some facade that you're invulnerable.

67
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.440
No one is invulnerable by any stretch of the imagination and to stand up and

68
00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:07.800
face. That is, is the best route that you have.

69
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.630
<v 0>Why, why do you think so many young men are following you because you,</v>

70
00:04:11.631 --> 00:04:13.710
you have a lot of years.

71
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.080
<v 2>The best for them genuinely that I'm encouraging more than</v>

72
00:04:19.081 --> 00:04:21.690
you do for young women. No, no, not, it's not.

73
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.610
<v 0>The way you think so many are young men.</v>

74
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.620
<v 2>Oh, well I think part of it's technological fluke. I mean,</v>

75
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.510
I came to prominence at least in part on YouTube because I put my university

76
00:04:33.511 --> 00:04:38.250
lectures there and it happens to be the case that 80% of the people who watch

77
00:04:38.251 --> 00:04:41.130
YouTube are young men. So there's that,

78
00:04:41.131 --> 00:04:45.990
and it's hard to know how to factor that in exactly. But then I'm also,

79
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.170
I think that young women are encouraged a lot,

80
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:51.120
which is fine as far as I'm concerned.

81
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.340
But I think that that's less true for young men now because we

82
00:04:56.341 --> 00:05:01.140
believe that there's something pernicious about male competence and

83
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.300
activity. It's part of a,

84
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.290
I suppose it's part of the notion that the best way to characterize Western

85
00:05:07.291 --> 00:05:11.490
society is as a tyrannical patriarchy, which is appalling doctrine,

86
00:05:11.491 --> 00:05:14.610
as far as I'm concerned, how come is that? Well,

87
00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:18.630
it's not a tyrannical patriarchy, so it's not tyrannical.

88
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.800
That's the first thing.

89
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.480
Certainly not compared to any other governmental form that currently

90
00:05:24.481 --> 00:05:26.610
exists and has ever existed.

91
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.350
And it's not essentially patriarchal unless you believe that women haven't

92
00:05:31.351 --> 00:05:35.820
contributed in immense part to the construction of what we have now.

93
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.103
So,

94
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.460
and I also don't believe that to the degree that it is patriarchal,

95
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.060
that its structure is dependent on the expression of power,

96
00:05:45.061 --> 00:05:48.690
arbitrary power on the part of men. I think that happens sometimes,

97
00:05:48.691 --> 00:05:50.130
but only when things go wrong.

98
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.730
<v 0>What you're doing and doing now as well is, is,</v>

99
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.170
is challenging. The,

100
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.690
the idea of gender equality that is very important in, in, in,

101
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.640
um, in Scandinavia. I think it's it's, as you probably know, um,

102
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.480
w why, why do you think that that can be a problem?

103
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.310
The idea of gender equality?

104
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.540
<v 2>I don't think that equality of opportunity is a problem.</v>

105
00:06:16.541 --> 00:06:19.840
I think that's a great thing. And anyone with any sense champions,

106
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.340
equality of opportunity. I mean,

107
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.870
even if you're purely selfish say and purely self-centered,

108
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.010
you'd want to set up an economy where everyone who had ability could be

109
00:06:30.011 --> 00:06:32.680
maximally exploited by everyone else,

110
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.920
because then we can all benefit from each other's talents.

111
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.930
And so equality of opportunity is absolutely useful fundamental

112
00:06:40.931 --> 00:06:44.110
principle, but that has nothing to do with equality of outcome.

113
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.100
Those things aren't even in the same conceptual universe and to strive for

114
00:06:48.101 --> 00:06:49.510
equality of outcome is well,

115
00:06:49.511 --> 00:06:51.880
it's a fool's game and likely to be extraordinarily,

116
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.850
it has proved to be in the past extraordinarily dangerous,

117
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.490
as well as impossible. So, I mean,

118
00:06:57.491 --> 00:07:01.450
one of the things we know for example is that I don't know to what degree it's

119
00:07:01.451 --> 00:07:02.890
common knowledge in Scandinavia,

120
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.600
but the biggest differences between men and women in the world in

121
00:07:07.601 --> 00:07:11.170
terms of temperament and interests are in Scandinavia.

122
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.950
And they've maximized as a consequence of the, your egalitarian policies.

123
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.000
What do you mean by that? It means that the more he galitary in your state,

124
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.540
the bigger, the personality differences between men and women,

125
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.250
that's like the it's.

126
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.470
<v 0>How do you measure that? How do you know that? Oh.</v>

127
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.890
<v 2>Well, psychologists have perfected at least to some degree,</v>

128
00:07:29.891 --> 00:07:33.910
the measure of personality over the last 30 years with very advanced statistical

129
00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:37.720
models. And so what you do is you offer men and women,

130
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.650
well validated tests of preference and of personality.

131
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.640
And you do that all across the world with tens of thousands of people in

132
00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:46.930
multi-country samples.

133
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.200
And then you look at the difference between men and women,

134
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.760
and then you rank order that by wealth and egalitarian social policy,

135
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.420
and what you find is the more egalitarian this society,

136
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.730
the more different the men and women become.

137
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.670
<v 0>Is there something you can recognize or is it.</v>

138
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.770
<v 3>I would say for me, it's quite the simple question actually,</v>

139
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.210
do we want that our sons and daughters should have the same

140
00:08:13.211 --> 00:08:17.950
opportunities and, uh, eh, the same MAB, eh,

141
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.420
the same dreams or hopes for the good thing or no?

142
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:27.340
And for me, it's simple to ask the answer that it's yes, of course. So for me,

143
00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:32.020
equality and gender equality is very, very important for me. Also,

144
00:08:32.021 --> 00:08:36.790
when we talk about gender equality is important for me to learn my daughter,

145
00:08:36.791 --> 00:08:39.250
that her mom, uh,

146
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.930
can lead and show the way and her dad can hug and kiss her

147
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.940
and show feelings. And I think that's something very important for the,

148
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.320
the hoods where kids grew up to show feelings to,

149
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.100
to have these gender equality discussions,

150
00:08:56.101 --> 00:09:00.510
to show her a way of opportunities and to strive forward.

151
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.630
And it's important both for, uh,

152
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.060
lonely men and lonely young men,

153
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.820
but also for women that feel this,

154
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.540
this roof of gloss, uh,

155
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:16.980
they need to fight them to struggle the roof of glass to

156
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.130
yeah. To be successful in their lives.

157
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.493
<v 2>Do you agree on this?</v>

158
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.820
I think that equality of opportunity is a perfectly reasonable proposition.

159
00:09:25.821 --> 00:09:29.240
I mean, I have a daughter and a wife, I do everything. I bought many,

160
00:09:29.241 --> 00:09:32.840
many female clients who I've consulted with and helped. And,

161
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.750
and in many cases, uh, accelerated,

162
00:09:35.751 --> 00:09:38.330
helped accelerate the development of their career tremendously.

163
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:43.310
It's of obviously of great utility to encourage forward

164
00:09:43.311 --> 00:09:44.210
striving in,

165
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.140
in young people and people in general that that's not the issue in the least,

166
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:52.190
but the issue is the outcome. Yeah. Well then why do you think, eh, the,

167
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.570
the outcome on these countries where they outcome is as is more equal,

168
00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.050
why do you think that leads to a bigger differences? Oh,

169
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.660
because there's only two reasons that men and women different.

170
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.170
One is cultural and the other is biological.

171
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.540
And if you minimize the cultural differences,

172
00:10:08.541 --> 00:10:10.490
you maximize the biological differences.

173
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:15.620
So I know everyone's shocked when they hear this, this isn't shocking news.

174
00:10:15.621 --> 00:10:18.920
People have known this in the scientific community for at least 25 years.

175
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:21.200
And it's been replicated in the last month,

176
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.130
three times in three separate samples, including in science,

177
00:10:25.131 --> 00:10:28.550
which is the world's greatest scientific magazine by a large margin.

178
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.130
And it isn't a small effect. It's a huge effect.

179
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.140
<v 4>Excuse me, what does it mean?</v>

180
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:37.700
Does it mean that Scandinavian men and women are having more difficulties

181
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:40.760
meeting each other, talking to each other than others?

182
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.200
<v 2>No, not necessarily,</v>

183
00:10:42.201 --> 00:10:47.090
but it does mean that there are reasons for differences in participation

184
00:10:47.091 --> 00:10:50.690
rates, in different occupations, that aren't a consequence of socialization.

185
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:56.210
So for example, as this especially true at the extreme. So for example, um,

186
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.590
on average,

187
00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:01.070
men are more interested in things and women are more interested in people.

188
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.310
And that's actually the biggest difference we know of psychologically between

189
00:11:04.311 --> 00:11:05.900
men and women. And,

190
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.320
and even though men and women are quite similar,

191
00:11:09.321 --> 00:11:12.170
all things considered the extremes make a difference.

192
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.290
So you imagine that in order to become an engineer, look,

193
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.330
obviously not everyone becomes an engineer.

194
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.350
You have to have a particular temperamental proclivity to become an engineer.

195
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:25.460
You have to be extraordinarily interested in things rather than people,

196
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.110
while most of those people are men. And if you want to become a nurse, well,

197
00:11:30.111 --> 00:11:33.530
then you have to be much more interested in people than you are in things.

198
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.480
And most of those people are women.

199
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:40.100
And so you get differences in occupational choice that are also by the way,

200
00:11:40.101 --> 00:11:41.420
quite great in Scandinavia,

201
00:11:41.421 --> 00:11:44.840
especially in the case of engineering and nursing that are mostly due to

202
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.980
biological differences. And you cannot minimize that by social engineering.

203
00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.280
So, and that is not a bad thing.

204
00:11:52.281 --> 00:11:56.830
Like look of the things you want to ask yourself is that what is the purpose of

205
00:11:56.831 --> 00:12:01.570
setting up a society that offers maximal equality of opportunity?

206
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.320
And one of the answers is that you maximize people's free choice.

207
00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.210
And if you maximize free choice,

208
00:12:07.211 --> 00:12:11.890
then you also maximize differences in choice between people.

209
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.150
And so you can't have both of those, but of course it will have.

210
00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:20.430
<v 3>Have differences is in short is of course, because we are human beings,</v>

211
00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.840
but I can't see why it differs between

212
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.750
me and [inaudible] for instance.

213
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:31.290
But of course it differs in biological things,

214
00:12:31.291 --> 00:12:36.030
but not in choices because I think more how we raise

215
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:36.800
them, uh,

216
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.160
how we'll live education sort of culture

217
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.680
attitudes, form a human being,

218
00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.180
whether or not they are a girl or a boy when they grow up.

219
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.500
And if I raise my daughter to become a leader,

220
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:57.450
to be self-confident to have a high education,

221
00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.100
for instance, I think she will have a good platform to become an civil engineer,

222
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:05.520
to become a CEO of a company or to become a nurse.

223
00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.230
<v 2>Oh, that, that is what, that is.</v>

224
00:13:07.231 --> 00:13:10.740
What people who think that the differences between people who are primarily

225
00:13:10.741 --> 00:13:14.310
culturally constructed believe, but it's not what the evidence suggests.

226
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.110
<v 3>Okay. You don't check</v>

227
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.170
[inaudible].

228
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:23.550
<v 2>To understand about this is this.</v>

229
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:27.930
This is not a contentious issue among informed scientists.

230
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:33.090
We've known this for 25 years. And so, and it's a perverse effect.

231
00:13:33.091 --> 00:13:34.080
No one expected it.

232
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:39.090
<v 0>Why, why do you talk then about you talk about chaos. Um,</v>

233
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:44.130
I mean, is, is what we're experiencing now, chaos, your book is,

234
00:13:44.131 --> 00:13:47.430
is called an antidote to chaos. What is the cows?

235
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.141
<v 2>Well,</v>

236
00:13:49.141 --> 00:13:53.160
I think the chaos is the uncertainty that so many people feel about the meaning

237
00:13:53.161 --> 00:13:55.320
of life and about their position in the world.

238
00:13:55.660 --> 00:14:00.600
That that's fundamentally what I was aiming at and what I'm trying to do in my

239
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:01.650
online lectures.

240
00:14:01.651 --> 00:14:04.920
And with my book is to provide people with a guideline to meaning.

241
00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.420
So one of the points that I make in my lectures for example,

242
00:14:09.421 --> 00:14:14.220
is that we actually have a biological instinct for meaning that orients us in

243
00:14:14.221 --> 00:14:15.054
the world.

244
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:19.590
And that instinct manifests itself when we

245
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.700
place ourselves in a position in the world where we're competent,

246
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:28.260
where what we're doing is working so that we're not too terrified and

247
00:14:28.261 --> 00:14:29.094
anxious,

248
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:33.000
but also while we're simultaneously advancing ourselves and improving our

249
00:14:33.001 --> 00:14:36.780
ability to cope with the world. So for example, if you watch an athlete,

250
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:40.740
high-level athlete, who's at the peak of his or her performance,

251
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.550
you see someone who's extraordinarily practiced at what they're doing and has

252
00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:46.620
developed the expertise necessary to do it,

253
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:51.590
but then you also see them push themselves on that developmental edge to make

254
00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:55.070
themselves just that much better. And that,

255
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.550
that function is associated with an intrinsic sense of meaning.

256
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.190
And whenever you see anyone manifest that you,

257
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.210
you are automatically drawn to it, you,

258
00:15:04.211 --> 00:15:08.630
you see that when an actor pushes him or herself beyond their limits,

259
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:13.070
you see that when someone speaks extemporaneously and manages it extraordinarily

260
00:15:13.071 --> 00:15:17.120
well, and I'm trying to help people understand that this,

261
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.950
this meaning is a true phenomenon. It's not a secondary thing.

262
00:15:21.951 --> 00:15:24.350
And also to point out that most of the time,

263
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.800
that meaning is associated with the adoption of responsibility.

264
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.110
So this is also something that people don't understand.

265
00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:35.090
<v 0>But, but, but part of the kales is that the rules are so hard to see the, the,</v>

266
00:15:35.091 --> 00:15:38.020
the, the, there aren't that obvious rules anymore.

267
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:43.000
<v 2>The chaos is that we we're transforming our landscape socially,</v>

268
00:15:43.001 --> 00:15:43.511
culturally,

269
00:15:43.511 --> 00:15:46.540
technologically so rapidly that it's hard for people to gain footing.

270
00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:48.820
And so it destabilizes us.

271
00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:52.600
<v 4>This isn't the real problem. That's</v>

272
00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.090
quite a lot of men.

273
00:15:55.510 --> 00:16:00.490
And also young men are struggling to deal with the fact that women now

274
00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.520
are more in control of their lives than earlier.

275
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:05.710
<v 2>I don't think that's the problem.</v>

276
00:16:05.711 --> 00:16:10.600
I think the problem is is that the idea that the West

277
00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:15.820
is a patriarchal tyranny is rapidly translated into the idea that

278
00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:20.170
young men who strive forward or to be regarded with suspicion because they're

279
00:16:20.171 --> 00:16:24.070
doing nothing but manifesting the same sort of tyrannical power that has kept

280
00:16:24.071 --> 00:16:26.350
women are oppressed for the last 2000 years.

281
00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:31.450
And I think that entire narrative is appalling right to the core. So,

282
00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:35.440
and I don't see that it's helpful to anyone because making young men weak or,

283
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:39.520
or a law or, or failing to encourage them to be strong,

284
00:16:39.521 --> 00:16:42.640
that's a better way of putting it certainly does the young men. No. Good.

285
00:16:42.641 --> 00:16:44.620
And it doesn't do the young women any good at all,

286
00:16:44.621 --> 00:16:45.850
if they want to find a partner.

287
00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.650
<v 4>So you're saying that all along,</v>

288
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:53.200
we may have had the same opportunities, always.

289
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:58.390
<v 2>No, I'm basically saying that all along hardly anyone had any opportunities.</v>

290
00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.080
I mean, if you look at the history of the world, um,

291
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:04.930
things really started to shift in about 1895,

292
00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:07.120
but before 1895,

293
00:17:07.121 --> 00:17:11.170
the typical person in the West lived on less than a dollar a day in today's

294
00:17:11.171 --> 00:17:12.910
money, which is about two thirds,

295
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.810
the UN cutoff for abject poverty by today's standards.

296
00:17:16.811 --> 00:17:20.710
And so what happened through most of the history of the world is that men and

297
00:17:20.711 --> 00:17:24.670
women struggled mightily together sometimes at each other's throats,

298
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.150
but mostly cooperatively to keep the Wolf from the door.

299
00:17:28.151 --> 00:17:32.890
And the tyrant have Bay life was very, very, very, very difficult.

300
00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:37.120
And the fact that we survived at all meant that fundamentally we cooperated

301
00:17:37.121 --> 00:17:41.860
despite the fact that were rife with stupidity ignorance and malevolence,

302
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.410
but what's.

303
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:44.170
<v 4>Terrifying with gender equality.</v>

304
00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:48.910
<v 2>Nothing here is except when people gerrymandered the data. It's like,</v>

305
00:17:48.911 --> 00:17:50.100
what do you mean by equality?

306
00:17:50.101 --> 00:17:53.100
Do you want women to have their free choice or not? If you do,

307
00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:56.520
they're not going to pick occupations that are the same as the occupations men.

308
00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:01.760
<v 3>But we have structures today that that women need to struggle. They need to,</v>

309
00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:05.240
to, uh, take a step, uh, to,

310
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.780
to have the possibility to become like a prime minister. As we talked before,

311
00:18:08.781 --> 00:18:12.140
we don't have had any prime minister in Sweden that had been a woman,

312
00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:13.490
for instance, uh,

313
00:18:13.491 --> 00:18:17.660
we have a lower rate of female entrepreneurs.

314
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:23.180
Uh, men had that higher income than women, uh, in Sweden.

315
00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:28.250
Uh, even if they work with the same, uh, tasks and they need the work,

316
00:18:28.251 --> 00:18:30.890
which one that I need to work with gender equality,

317
00:18:30.891 --> 00:18:35.570
I think even in the lower class in schools to learn kids how

318
00:18:35.571 --> 00:18:37.130
to play with dolls,

319
00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:46.970
[inaudible] we need to, I think we need to learn boys to be more sensitive,

320
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.990
but also young girls to become more self-confident.

321
00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.030
And I think that's very important too.

322
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.920
<v 2>Well, the problem with that,</v>

323
00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.930
the problem with that is the data indicate that the consequence of the policies

324
00:18:59.931 --> 00:19:03.890
that you're promoting have maximized the differences between men and women.

325
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:09.290
So that isn't what it's doing now that isn't to say that the movement

326
00:19:09.291 --> 00:19:12.530
towards egalitarianism is necessarily a bad thing,

327
00:19:12.531 --> 00:19:15.470
but tremendous amount of that's being driven, not by social policy,

328
00:19:15.471 --> 00:19:17.570
but by technology. I mean, you know,

329
00:19:17.571 --> 00:19:21.050
the narrative that we're fed now is that up until 1960,

330
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.310
when the enlightened feminists developed their egalitarian doctrines,

331
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:29.480
men had kept women down and they finally Rose.

332
00:19:29.481 --> 00:19:33.710
And the truth of the matter is, is that from about nine, 1895 onward,

333
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:37.820
there was a series of technological revolutions that were extraordinarily

334
00:19:37.821 --> 00:19:42.770
powerful in their impact that allowed women to step forward free of

335
00:19:42.771 --> 00:19:46.520
many of the burdens that had kept them back in the past birth control being one

336
00:19:46.521 --> 00:19:48.770
of them, but only, only, only one

337
00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:54.650
sanitary facilities of all sorts plumbing had a huge role to play.

338
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.190
Tampons had a huge role to play as did sanitary napkins.

339
00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:03.340
All of these technologies developed that enabled women to, uh, to, to,

340
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.650
to move forward, to move forward with, with,

341
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:09.080
with less biological impediments, let's say.

342
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:14.270
<v 0>What would you say is the best period in history to be both a man and a woman.</v>

343
00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.290
<v 2>Clearly now there's no, absolutely no doubt about that.</v>

344
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:22.250
<v 0>Anyone who would like to worry for the kales, you worry about the kales.</v>

345
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:26.360
<v 2>You know, it's nice if we could make things better than they are.</v>

346
00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:29.240
And I would say that just as all around the world,

347
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:33.890
we're raising living standards at a rate that is absolutely unparalleled in

348
00:20:33.891 --> 00:20:38.570
human history. We're also in danger of destabilizing our culture in the West.

349
00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.950
<v 0>And I don't think that part of that problem you called, uh,</v>

350
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.250
you talk about there is what we call the identity. Yes.

351
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:52.450
<v 2>I think that any O any political position that puts someone's group identity</v>

352
00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:57.340
ahead of their individuality is a regression to a kind of a regression

353
00:20:57.341 --> 00:21:01.720
to a tribalism that will definitely become violent because that's what happens

354
00:21:01.721 --> 00:21:02.470
to try.

355
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:03.430
<v 0>What's an example.</v>

356
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:10.660
<v 2>Of identity politics playing that role. What happens every time people divide,</v>

357
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.000
divide themselves into tribal groups. I mean,

358
00:21:13.001 --> 00:21:16.330
what we're trying to do to make peace is to bring people under the rubric of

359
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:21.010
something, approximating a single identity, a shared identity. And I mean,

360
00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.590
the evidence that people fight in tribes, it's the,

361
00:21:23.591 --> 00:21:25.600
that's the entire evidence of the human race.

362
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.510
And the farther back you go in time and the smaller,

363
00:21:28.511 --> 00:21:30.310
the tribal groups become the higher,

364
00:21:30.311 --> 00:21:33.580
the rates of inter tribal warfare and the higher the rates of homicide.

365
00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.990
<v 0>And, and, and this you're talking about, there's this,</v>

366
00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:42.180
I think it's part of why you also are people feel some kind of ambivalence

367
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:47.310
towards, towards you also. I mean, we call it controversial from time to time.

368
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:51.810
And, um, I don't know. Do you like that being controversial? Do you enjoy, uh,

369
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.710
provoking groups? Like.

370
00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.420
<v 2>No, and I don't provoke people. I just say what I think.</v>

371
00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:01.650
I just see what you believe to be true. Well, that's no, I don't. I say,

372
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:06.270
I say what I believe to be true and people find that provoking.

373
00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.900
That's not the same as me provoking people. If I was provoking people,

374
00:22:09.901 --> 00:22:13.440
I would be setting out to upset them and I'm not setting out to upset them.

375
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:18.630
I'm just setting out to say what I believe to be true. And I'm a very, you're.

376
00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.940
<v 0>Following the, the, the rules. We talked.</v>

377
00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.690
<v 2>About this. And when I'm talking about gender, gender issues, for example,</v>

378
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.870
in personality, that's actually one of my fields of expertise.

379
00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:32.520
I know the literature and it says exactly what I said. It says. And as I said,

380
00:22:32.521 --> 00:22:35.850
as well, it's been replicated three times in the last month.

381
00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:40.620
The London times came out three weeks ago and said that the finding that

382
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:45.780
gender differences maximize as he galitary and policies are developed is now one

383
00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:50.340
of the most solidly grounded findings ever produced by social scientists.

384
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.710
So, you know, you can make of that, what you want.

385
00:22:52.711 --> 00:22:56.450
It's not something that I particularly enjoy. It just happens to be the case.

386
00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.070
<v 0>Sorry, the fake news about John Pittson.</v>

387
00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.750
<v 2>Oh, well, the, the fake news is one is that I'm provocative.</v>

388
00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:08.160
The other is that the other is that I have a,

389
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:11.880
like a right leaning or a particularly conservative agenda.

390
00:23:11.881 --> 00:23:15.180
And the mere fact that I oppose radical left.

391
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:17.040
<v 0>You're a conservative at heart, aren't you?</v>

392
00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:22.170
<v 2>Not particularly, um, I don't have the temperament for it. So for example,</v>

393
00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.440
our conservative people tend to be low in trait, openness,

394
00:23:25.441 --> 00:23:29.310
which is associated with creativity. And I am very high in trade openness.

395
00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:32.490
And so temperamentally, I'm not much of a conservative at all.

396
00:23:32.491 --> 00:23:34.110
And people who knew me,

397
00:23:34.111 --> 00:23:37.230
people who come to my house would certainly not think that I was a conservative

398
00:23:37.231 --> 00:23:41.880
person. So, or, or if they, they saw the breadth of my ideas,

399
00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:46.460
I'm also very entrepreneurially minded, which also is not with conservatism.

400
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:51.890
<v 1>Um, I am a great skeptic of well-meaning attempts to</v>

401
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:55.670
adjust large social systems on the basis of ideology,

402
00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:57.770
but that doesn't make me conservative.

403
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.830
It just makes me educated social scientists.

404
00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:02.620
<v 0>So w w when,</v>

405
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:08.020
when are you provoked herself?

406
00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.770
<v 1>Um, when am I provoked myself? Oh, being called a Nazi.</v>

407
00:24:14.771 --> 00:24:19.690
I find somewhat provoking that I think one of the most observed days. No,

408
00:24:19.691 --> 00:24:24.160
no, certainly not one of the most absurd days in my life, in the last two years.

409
00:24:24.161 --> 00:24:26.320
And there's been plenty of them was a day,

410
00:24:26.321 --> 00:24:30.250
probably three months ago where I was accused by one magazine in the UK of being

411
00:24:30.251 --> 00:24:34.480
a Jewish shill and another magazine in the United States of being an alt-right

412
00:24:34.481 --> 00:24:36.850
Nazi. I thought, well, that's, that's it,

413
00:24:36.851 --> 00:24:41.290
I pretty much covered both ends of the insults. It's like, yeah, that's right.

414
00:24:41.291 --> 00:24:45.160
So you can average that out to zero, I suppose. So, um,

415
00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:49.870
I find, I find that somewhat provoking, um,

416
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:54.100
but you know, you take the good with the bad and, and I I'm,

417
00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:57.700
I'm not, I'm not complaining about it. It's funny. It is.

418
00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:02.020
<v 0>Is, is it, is it true that you have an opinion about,</v>

419
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.860
about people, uh,

420
00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:11.020
having to stay married if they have children? I mean, men here,

421
00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:15.560
it's better if they do it's. I think most people would,

422
00:25:15.730 --> 00:25:20.230
would agree that that's the best bit, but yeah, as far as I understand you,

423
00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:24.490
you think that the laws should say that we have to stay together.

424
00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:28.150
<v 1>It isn't obvious to me that the liberalization of the divorce laws in the</v>

425
00:25:28.151 --> 00:25:31.960
sixties was for everyone's best interest now. Exactly what that means.

426
00:25:31.961 --> 00:25:33.010
I'm not sure. I mean,

427
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.310
it's okay for people to go to hell in hand in hand basket in their own

428
00:25:36.311 --> 00:25:41.140
particular means of choosing. But we do know that stable, intact,

429
00:25:41.141 --> 00:25:44.620
two parent families are better for children. So, you know,

430
00:25:44.621 --> 00:25:47.230
it depends on who you put first. And look,

431
00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:51.010
I'm not saying that everyone who's got divorced is reprehensible.

432
00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:55.870
I understand that life is very difficult and that it's a very hard thing to

433
00:25:55.871 --> 00:25:58.630
maintain a relationship over a very long period of time,

434
00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:03.460
but it's not obvious to me that we're better off for the additional plethora of

435
00:26:03.461 --> 00:26:04.570
choices. So.

436
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:05.081
<v 0>We'll see.</v>

437
00:26:05.081 --> 00:26:08.320
But there isn't that an individual choice and not something the law should

438
00:26:08.321 --> 00:26:09.154
decide.

439
00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:12.910
<v 1>Well, it depends to some degree on whether the law should advocate for children.</v>

440
00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:16.750
I mean, children really can't speak for themselves. Can they,

441
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:21.580
they need some authority to speak for them. And so we do know like the data,

442
00:26:21.581 --> 00:26:22.630
for example, on,

443
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:27.490
on child welfare indicates Krista it's crystal clear that

444
00:26:27.491 --> 00:26:31.450
children from intact two-parent families do better on virtually every measure

445
00:26:31.451 --> 00:26:35.050
that you can possibly imagine. So what are we supposed to make of that?

446
00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:38.650
It's irrelevant. She's like maybe the rule should be, if,

447
00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:42.970
if you don't have children, then no problem divorce is no problem.

448
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:47.340
If you have children and plus it's not like divorce solves the problem with

449
00:26:47.341 --> 00:26:51.420
regards to, to, to your relationship with your ex,

450
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:55.800
it often produces a whole boatload of problems that you didn't expect. So,

451
00:26:55.801 --> 00:26:59.790
but I'm not advocating draconian measures to keep people together who don't want

452
00:26:59.791 --> 00:27:03.060
to be together. That that horse has already left the barn.

453
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:08.210
<v 0>Age, limit on the children where you can divorce or, well, the older,</v>

454
00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.570
the older the children are the less effect it has on them. So, you know, and

455
00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:17.960
the alleged for divorce, yes. 45,

456
00:27:17.961 --> 00:27:22.010
something like that. I don't know. I don't know what the,

457
00:27:22.011 --> 00:27:26.150
I don't know what the ideal age. What about, what about when you were,

458
00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:31.130
when you were a kid yourself? Who, who was your, uh, masculine role model?

459
00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:34.670
<v 1>Oh, I think I had a number of them,</v>

460
00:27:34.671 --> 00:27:38.120
but it would probably primarily have been my father and some of my friends

461
00:27:38.121 --> 00:27:41.600
because peers play an important role in, in development,

462
00:27:41.601 --> 00:27:44.570
especially after a year after the age of about four,

463
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:46.520
but I would definitely say it was my father.

464
00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:51.470
And how would you describe his masculinity? Well, he, to your point, um,

465
00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.470
he spent a tremendous amount of time with me when I was a kid.

466
00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:58.810
And they're very fond memories as far as I'm concerned. Like when,

467
00:27:58.811 --> 00:28:02.030
when I was a young, when I was very young, two and three,

468
00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:06.530
my dad would come home from work and he spent an hour and a half with me at

469
00:28:06.531 --> 00:28:10.100
night for, for a long time teaching me to read,

470
00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:14.810
which has been in estimate benefit with me. And he did many things with me,

471
00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:19.310
you know, we hunted and trapped and canoed and fished and CA and, and,

472
00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.170
um, he was a harsh guy in many ways. He was a disciplinary and in some sense,

473
00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.090
um, but,

474
00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:31.280
but he was very honest and very good craftsman. And, uh,

475
00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:35.390
and so I learned a lot about, um,

476
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:40.850
trying to conduct yourself in a respectable manner from him. So.

477
00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:46.670
<v 0>Were you a, a tough kid or were you a Kanthal kid or what kind of kid were you?</v>

478
00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:50.240
<v 1>Hi, I guess it depends on what you mean by tough. No,</v>

479
00:28:50.241 --> 00:28:52.250
I don't think if you would have met me when I was a kid,

480
00:28:52.251 --> 00:28:55.940
you would've thought I was tough. I'm kind of a tender hearted character. And,

481
00:28:56.330 --> 00:29:00.800
um, and I was skipped a grade and I was small for my age. And so,

482
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:06.080
um, I certainly wasn't physically tough in the standard sense,

483
00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:11.180
um, because I was small and because I'd been put ahead of grade, I was never,

484
00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:16.010
um, particularly fast style at sports. And that was kind of a problem.

485
00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.490
I did something about that when I got older, but, um,

486
00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:21.680
I hung around with tough kids,

487
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:26.720
but that was partly because most of the kids that were in the

488
00:29:26.721 --> 00:29:27.860
town I grew up in were,

489
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:33.860
were either tough kids or were sort of off the radar entirely. And so,

490
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:36.620
and maybe that was a certain amount of compensation.

491
00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.100
I could defend myself verbally fairly well. So,

492
00:29:40.101 --> 00:29:42.970
but that tended to get me hung up by my, you know,

493
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:46.930
my shirt color in closets and played catch with on the stairs and that sort of

494
00:29:46.931 --> 00:29:49.000
thing in junior high. So, um.

495
00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.630
<v 0>Is it, is it like, uh,</v>

496
00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:55.950
do you come from an environment where, where,

497
00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:00.120
where we can as was a bad thing where self-pitying was a bad thing.

498
00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:04.680
<v 1>Um, where self-pitying was a bad thing? I would say, yes,</v>

499
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:07.890
I come from that background, but that was, that was par for the course,

500
00:30:07.891 --> 00:30:12.540
I would say when I grew up and I mean, where, where I grew up,

501
00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:15.600
it was still a frontier place. In some sense, you know,

502
00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:20.310
my town was only 50 years old and people were essentially

503
00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:23.040
self-reliant to the degree that that was possible.

504
00:30:23.041 --> 00:30:26.550
It was certainly the case within my family, on both my mother and father's side.

505
00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:29.910
And the idea was, but this wasn't particularly,

506
00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:35.490
what would you say unique to my family? You know, they, ethos was

507
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:40.260
feeling sorry for yourself. Isn't going to be of much utility.

508
00:30:40.261 --> 00:30:44.550
You should get out there and do what you can do and straighten your back.

509
00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:46.260
Yes. If you can do that.

510
00:30:46.261 --> 00:30:49.860
And I got lots of encouragement from my parents from both of them. Um,

511
00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.490
certainly I've a very good relationship with my mother who I loved very much.

512
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.890
And we, we shared a sense of humor, which was lovely. And my dad,

513
00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:02.070
although he was a harsh taskmaster, um,

514
00:31:02.071 --> 00:31:07.020
also was very encouraging to me in that he believed that

515
00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.450
I could do whatever I put my mind to.

516
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:14.580
And he helped instill that conviction in me in a manner that I hope

517
00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:17.160
wasn't and isn't too, um,

518
00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:21.960
let's say narcissistic, it wasn't a matter of privilege.

519
00:31:21.961 --> 00:31:25.500
It was a matter of drive and dedication and effort.

520
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:30.780
And so that was one of the things that's so sad about what I'm doing.

521
00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:33.510
You know, I'm going all around the world and I'm talking to many,

522
00:31:33.511 --> 00:31:37.920
many people I've talked to about 250,000 people in the last six months.

523
00:31:37.921 --> 00:31:42.780
And I offer encouraging words. You know, that people,

524
00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.900
I believe that people are stronger than their misfortunes.

525
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:50.580
I believe that if you turn around and confront the vulnerability,

526
00:31:50.581 --> 00:31:52.080
that's part and parcel of life,

527
00:31:52.081 --> 00:31:56.220
you'll find within yourself a strength that will transcend that. And I,

528
00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.110
I believe that not only to be true,

529
00:31:58.111 --> 00:32:03.090
but supported by the best clinical evidence and that it's important for lost

530
00:32:03.091 --> 00:32:05.670
young people, male and female alike,

531
00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:10.530
to develop a vision and take on some responsibility and understand

532
00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:14.520
that they have a vital role to play in the world, that.

533
00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:18.600
<v 0>The lack of their best hurts day.</v>

534
00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:23.940
<v 1>I think that's true. And the sad thing is that very.</v>

535
00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.130
<v 0>There's very many people who have not.</v>

536
00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.860
<v 1>Heard an encouraging word in their life, and.</v>

537
00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:31.980
<v 0>It takes so little to encourage them.</v>

538
00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:36.210
<v 1>It's rather tragic. You know, I have people come up to me and I mean all,</v>

539
00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:39.860
and by all the time, I mean many people every day.

540
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.580
<v 2>In the lectures and on the street who tell me, I was in a bad place.</v>

541
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:47.360
I was struggling. I've been watching your lectures.

542
00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:51.320
I've been reading your book. I put my life together.

543
00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:54.470
I'm trying to be responsible. Tell the truth.

544
00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:59.210
Things are way better. Thank you. And so that's,

545
00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:04.970
can't, can't get any better than that. So, and that's.

546
00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:13.570
<v 5>[Inaudible] back to the divorce.</v>

547
00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:14.673
<v 4>Question.</v>

548
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:19.780
What is the best situation to tell your children?

549
00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.220
We don't love each other anymore,

550
00:33:21.221 --> 00:33:25.960
but we're going to stay together for your sake so that you will have assemblance

551
00:33:25.961 --> 00:33:29.890
of a happy family life or to say, I'm sorry,

552
00:33:29.891 --> 00:33:34.090
this doesn't work. We'll, we'll continue to love you, but we'll part,

553
00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:37.600
and we'll love you the rest of our lives.

554
00:33:37.601 --> 00:33:41.980
And maybe we even can be happy on, on our different.

555
00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.230
<v 2>Well, sometimes, sometimes,</v>

556
00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:49.180
often you have to make the best of a bad lot. You know? I mean,

557
00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:53.260
sometimes the best possible choice isn't there in front of you. And I would say,

558
00:33:53.261 --> 00:33:54.070
well,

559
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:58.360
it's generally up to each person to decide under the

560
00:33:58.361 --> 00:33:59.230
circumstances,

561
00:33:59.231 --> 00:34:02.980
which of those pathways forward would be likely to cause the least amount of

562
00:34:02.981 --> 00:34:07.810
misery for, well, you know, for you, for your wife, for your kids,

563
00:34:07.811 --> 00:34:11.140
you know, you have to balance all of that out. That's not an easy thing to do.

564
00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:16.780
Um, I would also say that by the time it comes to the point where you're

565
00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:19.030
divorced divorcing, um,

566
00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:24.150
all you may have left or one of two suboptimal choices. And you know,

567
00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:29.020
so part of what I do as well is to try to lecture about what sort of

568
00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:33.010
interactions might facilitate a marriage,

569
00:34:33.011 --> 00:34:37.030
such that it's less likely to end up in a situation like that. Now,

570
00:34:37.031 --> 00:34:40.840
sometimes people have irreconcilable differences and there's nothing that can be

571
00:34:40.841 --> 00:34:45.250
done about it. But often people are not good at negotiating,

572
00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:49.300
partly because they don't, they won't admit what they want,

573
00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:53.200
because then they know that then they know if they're not getting it,

574
00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:56.140
they make their criteria for failure clear, and that frightens them.

575
00:34:56.141 --> 00:34:59.200
So they keep themselves vague because they don't know what they want.

576
00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:01.120
They can't communicate it to their partners.

577
00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.560
And they don't know how to do that anyways,

578
00:35:02.561 --> 00:35:05.950
because they're not very good at negotiating and then they avoid conflict.

579
00:35:05.951 --> 00:35:08.830
And so then the conflict, because when you avoid conflict,

580
00:35:08.831 --> 00:35:11.140
all you do is store it up for the future. And, you know,

581
00:35:11.141 --> 00:35:15.430
I've seen lots of people on the brink of divorce and in horrible marital

582
00:35:15.431 --> 00:35:19.270
situations, horrible family situations. And, you know,

583
00:35:19.271 --> 00:35:24.040
they have 25,000 disputes that haven't been settled.

584
00:35:24.041 --> 00:35:25.600
And at that point it's like,

585
00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:29.320
maybe divorce is the best option,

586
00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.560
but that doesn't mean that it was the best option from the beginning.

587
00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:36.880
So hopefully people can learn to negotiate and to tell each other the,

588
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.400
and that will increase.

589
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.570
<v 1>The probability that they can maintain their relationships in a stable manner.</v>

590
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.860
But, and I'm not sure.

591
00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.970
<v 0>I'm not suggesting by the way that you didn't do that because I don't know</v>

592
00:35:46.971 --> 00:35:48.170
anything about your situation.

593
00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:53.420
<v 1>No. So I'm a little bit surprised that you don't take into account</v>

594
00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:58.370
our level of irrationality or super irrational people when you

595
00:35:58.371 --> 00:35:58.821
discuss.

596
00:35:58.821 --> 00:36:02.420
It's like we can all just agree on these things and look at the science and the

597
00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.670
real fix everything. That's not how we vote. No,

598
00:36:04.671 --> 00:36:06.590
I don't think people are rational at all.

599
00:36:06.591 --> 00:36:10.130
And I think that it's very difficult for us to negotiate and it's amazing that

600
00:36:10.131 --> 00:36:10.964
we ever live in peace.

601
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:16.580
<v 0>Yeah. It's tremendously difficult. So one last question. When,</v>

602
00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:18.380
when are you irrational?

603
00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:24.500
<v 1>When I'm hungry, what happens then? Um,</v>

604
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:26.150
little things bother.

605
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:28.460
<v 0>Me far more than they would bother any reasonable.</v>

606
00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.470
<v 1>Person. So that's,</v>

607
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:34.340
and I would say if you find that you're irrational like that frequently,

608
00:36:34.341 --> 00:36:36.380
one of the things you might try is to eat something.

609
00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.990
<v 0>And you, and you have a, you have a peculiar diet. You have a, you have,</v>

610
00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:44.090
you could say that again. Yes. What, what, what is it, what what's the, well,

611
00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.380
there seems to be some sort of.

612
00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:49.700
<v 1>Auto-immune condition in my family and some of it's also reflected in my wife's</v>

613
00:36:49.701 --> 00:36:50.870
family, unfortunately.

614
00:36:50.871 --> 00:36:55.100
And the culmination of that was that my daughter had an extraordinarily serious,

615
00:36:55.310 --> 00:37:00.140
serious set of auto-immune dysfunctions that caused her

616
00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.080
an endless amount of misery and destruction.

617
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:07.640
And she found out about three years ago as a consequence of very,

618
00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:13.010
very careful experimentation that if she ate nothing but

619
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:17.240
meat, then all her symptoms disappeared. So,

620
00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:22.070
and her primary symptoms were degenerative bone disease that had been diagnosed

621
00:37:22.071 --> 00:37:26.180
as idiopathic arthritis, which means arthritis with no known cause.

622
00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.840
And she had her ankle and her hip replaced when she was in her teens because of

623
00:37:29.841 --> 00:37:34.040
that and had 38 other effective affected joints. So it was hell.

624
00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:35.510
And, um,

625
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:39.590
she caught onto the fact that diet had something to do with it for a variety of

626
00:37:39.591 --> 00:37:41.090
reasons. I can't go into and,

627
00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:45.680
and radically restricted her eating and all her symptoms disappeared.

628
00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:49.130
So that is why the, you do it as well. Yes. Well, I had many,

629
00:37:49.131 --> 00:37:51.410
but not all of the same symptoms. And she told,

630
00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:54.350
I watched what happened to her and I thought, well,

631
00:37:54.351 --> 00:37:56.840
that's impossible because it was,

632
00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:59.990
and she encouraged me to try it and I thought, well,

633
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:04.040
I can try anything for a month. You know? And so I,

634
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:08.840
I started for a month and I had changes almost immediately. And so,

635
00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:13.550
um, I've continued with a very restricted diet for about two years and

636
00:38:13.551 --> 00:38:16.790
extraordinarily restricted for the last eight months. So,

637
00:38:16.791 --> 00:38:21.320
and that seems to be working for me quite well, even though it's,

638
00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:25.220
you know, it has its downsides. Uh,

639
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.640
Jordan Peterson has been so interesting talking to you. Thank you so much.

640
00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:28.970
Thanks.

641
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:29.803
<v 0>You very much.</v>

642
00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:37.310
