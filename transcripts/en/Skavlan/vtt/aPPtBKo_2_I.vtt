<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.310
<v 2>How was I see, I don't even remember that.</v>

3
00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:22.280
I know I used to talk about musicals because I have a thing about, you know,

4
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.530
people say, Oh, you're transgender. You would like musical. I dumb.

5
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.450
It's not my thing. I like action movies.

6
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.470
<v 0>How, how do you think? I mean, you're, you're an, I was speaking of, um,</v>

7
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.590
of you being an athlete before you came over here. Ah, wow.

8
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.410
<v 2>I think we use that word advisedly. I'm an endurance runner.</v>

9
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.150
There are limpias and then I'm an injury and I just, I'm very slow.

10
00:00:41.151 --> 00:00:45.410
I'm one of the slowest people in the world. People, I run these marathons.

11
00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:48.570
I don't know if you've, I run multiple marathons and I've,

12
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.400
I've run 27 and 27 days, but very slowly,

13
00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.540
But you know, you know, the Olympic record,

14
00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:04.190
but they're almost down to two hours. Yeah. And I'm almost up to 12 hours.

15
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.390
See, I can do very long for one Meritor. I had interviews on the same day,

16
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.980
but I just took a long time.

17
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.040
I stopped when I talked to people and cows and dogs and cats and things.

18
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.490
So what I do is it's a holistic math thins.

19
00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:19.730
I run what I feel like running where I want to run.

20
00:01:19.731 --> 00:01:23.360
I don't run an organized marathons. I run. I just go, I'll go down there.

21
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.380
<v 0>Just you. Yeah. It's uh, I mean, uh,</v>

22
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.660
they have created their, their sports now and left, left, uh, at the top.

23
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.590
Um, do you think there is an age limit when it comes to sports?

24
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.420
<v 2>No. Well, there shouldn't be,</v>

25
00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:40.970
if you were 90 and you could be that everyone and then good luck to you,

26
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.760
but I think the probably is, and, uh, and you know, Olympian athletes,

27
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.330
they're going to know where that edge is. I, you know, I, the trouble is,

28
00:01:50.331 --> 00:01:53.310
I suppose, in sports when you get to 30 that's that's.

29
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.770
<v 0>Ticking, but do you,</v>

30
00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:58.100
are you an athlete in the sense that you have the germ paranoia as well?

31
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.030
<v 2>No. I think germs are good for you. You know, like I do the other thing. Well,</v>

32
00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:04.600
you know, Howard Hughes did this thing, you know, the,

33
00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:07.910
the big billionaire in America and he was doing tissues and stuff in the gyms,

34
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.290
but then you don't build up the antibodies. So I do it the other way round. Um,

35
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.720
and I know I'm sure, you know, professional athletes,

36
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.930
very good Olympian athletes, they will have a way of doing it.

37
00:02:17.931 --> 00:02:21.860
But what I do is eat a piece of dirt, put a piece of dirt in your food. Yeah.

38
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.550
Because think about it. Think about all our, you know, if you're from Norway,

39
00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:28.730
Sweden, Britain, China, wherever you're from the whole world,

40
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.380
we've come from people who were not living with antiseptic handwash yet.

41
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.610
They were just living in camps and things and they were nomads and they got

42
00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:40.100
through it. Didn't they? They weren't go. I've got, Oh yeah.

43
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.980
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, they became like 30 years old.</v>

44
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.950
<v 2>Okay. That's a good point. Yes.</v>

45
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.270
But maybe that was because they were just working so hard to say.

46
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.960
<v 0>Uh, you, you, you're coming to, to, to Sweden and Norway, uh,</v>

47
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.220
touring in the spring, uh, uh, with the, uh, show you called

48
00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:02.603
[inaudible] German name.

49
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.680
<v 2>Well I've,</v>

50
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.770
I'm against Brexit hate and Trump hate and all the negative right-wing let's

51
00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:11.280
separate stick our heads in the ground and go backwards for humanity.

52
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.530
I am forgoing.

53
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.590
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

54
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.710
<v 2>Right. You learn to live together and work together in some shape or form.</v>

55
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.580
And if you take Norway in particular, Norway, back at the Vikings,

56
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.300
Norway used to zip over, um, no. Is your country. Yeah. Yeah.

57
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.530
So you used to zip over and say, can we, uh, just kill everyone?

58
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.750
<v 1>Like all this stuff will come and do.</v>

59
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.790
<v 2>A chat shows and stuff, and that's much nicer.</v>

60
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.240
<v 1>This is, this is the logic. And we do this and we see the</v>

61
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.880
[inaudible].

62
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.370
<v 2>The whole thing of a purity of a race is nonsense.</v>

63
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.650
Cause we're all into married into together.

64
00:03:52.651 --> 00:03:56.370
And our language is interlinked and it's difficult. European union,

65
00:03:56.371 --> 00:04:00.720
very difficult. And they don't always not is in the European economic area,

66
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.500
but it's still the idea. My thing is I perform,

67
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.310
I develop my next show. There's wonder about show in French two to four say,

68
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.040
and I will be back in Paris in December, uh, doing it.

69
00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:12.510
So if anyone could learn French by December,

70
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.740
I'll be there during the game bridge. And I do, I improvise in French. And then,

71
00:04:16.741 --> 00:04:19.950
because I wanted to redouble my office and this is all because of Brexit and

72
00:04:19.951 --> 00:04:20.440
Trump. Oh.

73
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.400
Because if half of my country is going backwards and I'm going to go even

74
00:04:23.401 --> 00:04:27.330
further forward. And I, I translated what I developed in French into German.

75
00:04:27.331 --> 00:04:30.990
I went to a free, the stretch to in Berlin and I did the [inaudible],

76
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.270
which was Zeshan and that sphere at the same time. So,

77
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.940
and then I translate it into English and I'm doing Spanish as well.

78
00:04:38.941 --> 00:04:41.940
And I want to do Russian and I want to do Arabic, but no Russia,

79
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.470
you don't speak Russia. No, at the moment I say, uh [inaudible] and uh, the,

80
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.160
the hello in Russian is really tricky. Um, uh, it's much bigger,

81
00:04:50.161 --> 00:04:52.500
but previous is high. And I know that one, I know specific,

82
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.310
specific bok choy cause Bolshoi ballet is the great ballet and specific Porsche

83
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.630
is, is thank you very much.

84
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.020
<v 0>Same liquidity. Is this your level? And this is my level of exactly what.</v>

85
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.500
<v 2>It's a tricky one, but, um, you know, German is a tricky one for me,</v>

86
00:05:07.501 --> 00:05:10.650
but it was the all Russian kids speak Russian or Mandarin.

87
00:05:10.651 --> 00:05:13.620
Chinese could speak Mandarin Chinese know languages that hard.

88
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.263
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

89
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.690
<v 0>What is this? I mean, it learning a language. Yeah.</v>

90
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.360
Is that about a talent or is it about.

91
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.690
<v 2>Determination? Motivation above all motivation.</v>

92
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.510
And I can prove that anyone can learn a language. I've got this great proof.

93
00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.350
It's a logic proof. Um, someone says, I can't learn. Learn, no, no, no, no, no.

94
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.260
We tried a million times. So I say, what do you want to learn? They say Spanish,

95
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.190
they manager, whatever I say, let's go there for a weekend. And then as you go,

96
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.410
I'll tell you to go ahead through customs.

97
00:05:43.411 --> 00:05:47.960
I'll just slip a block of heroin into your bag. That's smuggling heroin.

98
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.460
That's Miami heroin. They go to prison for 10 years to life.

99
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.280
And within one month they're doing basic sentences.

100
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.820
<v 1>In the Spanish in general, whatever is because the motivation.</v>

101
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.080
<v 2>Will be, I better learn this language.</v>

102
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:03.183
<v 1>Die and.</v>

103
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.920
<v 2>It's just motivation. And everyone goes, Oh yeah, I suppose so.</v>

104
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.000
But because I came out as transgender 33 years ago when we were all children,

105
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.550
um, and I got no front cover of any newspaper at all. Uh, I, what I did, uh,

106
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.320
because I can set up artificial emergencies, I can set up, uh, you know,

107
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.930
back in 85, there was no reason to,

108
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.360
as a straight transgender person to come out, I could have lied.

109
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.780
Like people have done throughout millennia going backwards. And I thought, no,

110
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.180
I'm the right person. I wanted to be in special forces.

111
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.810
I didn't go to special forces. So I did the psychological, you know,

112
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.160
civilian special forces of coming out and taking all the crap that I get in the

113
00:06:39.161 --> 00:06:42.160
streets that I get less in the streets these days. But you know,

114
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.520
people shouting me, people fighting me. I will deal with that,

115
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.260
but this is a better place I've got to.

116
00:06:47.261 --> 00:06:51.070
And then people are more relaxed these days in all our countries in always,

117
00:06:51.071 --> 00:06:53.320
we didn't really get that. Everyone's more relaxed.

118
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.470
<v 0>Did this, this, this is also about determination. Yes.</v>

119
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:57.850
It's a decision that you made.

120
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.490
<v 2>Yeah. I'm a determined little bastard. Yeah. When you, when you,</v>

121
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.910
when you're working, I mean.

122
00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.130
<v 0>Uh, talk, talk about enduring pain. I mean, it's, it's, uh, eh,</v>

123
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.690
the way you work is that when you preparing for a tour now yep. Uh,

124
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.800
you go on stage here in London. I saw you the other night. Uh,

125
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.150
and it's like, incredible because you, you walk on it, you just start talking.

126
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.850
Yeah. Uh, uh, and, and part of is of course you,

127
00:07:26.851 --> 00:07:29.800
you get a huge loss and some material,

128
00:07:29.801 --> 00:07:33.700
you just make a little note that this does not work. Uh,

129
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.240
how much pain can you endure? Uh, well.

130
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.340
<v 2>I don't think that's painful. It's like you, when you're doing,</v>

131
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.220
remember your first ever chat show that you did,

132
00:07:42.221 --> 00:07:45.330
that was probably pretty painful now. Less painful. Yeah. It's,

133
00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:48.490
it's the pressure. It's what happens. It's like driving a car,

134
00:07:48.491 --> 00:07:51.250
driving a car is a very good example. When we learned to drive a car,

135
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.120
it was a nightmare.

136
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.840
And we're going to hit a human that CA a dog we're going to hit another car.

137
00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:00.370
Remember that those times were as well. Oh, hang on. I would stole it,

138
00:08:00.371 --> 00:08:04.120
stole all that pressure. And now we do it for three hours ago. Yes.

139
00:08:04.121 --> 00:08:06.230
I know what you mean. Yeah. What I then, so.

140
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.250
<v 1>Anyway.</v>

141
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.210
<v 2>We will have these conversations. We'll fiddle with the radio, but stuff up.</v>

142
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:14.950
Yeah, I know. Sure. Hang on.

143
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.650
<v 1>We're pretty good.</v>

144
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:20.320
<v 2>In that car thing, but that's an amazing thing.</v>

145
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.210
As you track back through humanity,

146
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.330
there's no reason we should be able to drive these mirror signal, maneuver,

147
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.650
you know, two ton vehicles, but we can do it. So the pressure gets less.

148
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:34.060
That's it? So as you saw me last night and the night before it was, uh, I'm,

149
00:08:34.061 --> 00:08:37.240
I'm not bothered because if I can do it in French, if I can do it in German,

150
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.080
if I can improvise in German, that improvising in English is like through,

151
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.700
you know, that's, that's the trick. I make things artificially hard for myself.

152
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:49.750
And then I get a gift of easiness back up the ladder in English. You're.

153
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.430
<v 0>Talking, you're talking a lot about religion.</v>

154
00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.460
<v 2>We, I don't believe in religion. I mean, I understand you talked a about it.</v>

155
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.880
It's great. It's a great area to go for. I will probably do that. The thing,

156
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:00.440
which is,

157
00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.710
I've only just discovered this in the last few days that no animal has religion.

158
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:09.120
Um, you know, no tigers ever go, okay,

159
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:10.890
we're going to go and we're going to get the antelope. Jimmy,

160
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:13.620
you come in the right flag. I'll come in the left gland pink Crow.

161
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.310
Then we'd go through all my I'm right around. We'll all go for it. And now, uh,

162
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.260
Padre, if you could make a prayer to.

163
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.540
<v 1>The gods, Timmy.</v>

164
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.373
<v 2>The tiger,</v>

165
00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.460
we going to please help us get in and get this antelope and rip it to pieces in

166
00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:30.600
the most merciful way that we can, you know, that just doesn't happen. So we,

167
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.700
and you'd think that if a God had made us all,

168
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:35.250
he would make sure religions and all, all the animals,

169
00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:39.840
all dogs should be praying every Tuesday at half four or something.

170
00:09:39.841 --> 00:09:44.490
But no, they didn't do any religion world war two. Is it world war two?

171
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.800
That's the time he was should have come down.

172
00:09:46.801 --> 00:09:51.120
If he made us all and we were praying like crazy and 50 million dying and this

173
00:09:51.121 --> 00:09:54.870
idiot with a mustache, you know, and that was the time to come down and go,

174
00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.050
what's that guy. I'm so sorry. I'm God, I'm sorry about that. Hit.

175
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.540
<v 1>Anyway. Carry on.</v>

176
00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:08.810
That didn't happen.

177
00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:13.520
<v 2>So I don't think he's coming guys. He doesn't come for tsunamis.</v>

178
00:10:13.521 --> 00:10:17.000
He doesn't come for earthquakes. He doesn't come for world Wars.

179
00:10:17.001 --> 00:10:20.540
He's not coming. And interestingly in Europe we have moved away.

180
00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:23.390
I think from God, maybe Republicans going it's like about towards me,

181
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.930
but most of us are moving away. Um, in America, you still,

182
00:10:26.931 --> 00:10:29.240
if you're going to get elected, you have to say, God bless America.

183
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.520
But in Britain, if we said, God bless Britain,

184
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:33.770
everyone would just look at you politically. They'd just go.

185
00:10:33.771 --> 00:10:34.910
I don't know what you're talking about.

186
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.670
Even though God is still supposed to be there somewhere.

187
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:42.410
<v 0>W would you, would you ever, I mean, have you, have you ever in your life,</v>

188
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.580
uh, sort of hoped that there was something there? Have you, have you,

189
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.570
have you prayed? Uh, well, my mom died when I was six and.

190
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:54.830
<v 2>Yeah, I did pray. I went to a school. We had no religion at home, but from six,</v>

191
00:10:54.831 --> 00:10:58.640
I went to a boarding school with my brother and they had a built in Protestant

192
00:10:58.641 --> 00:11:02.240
church of England, kind of a light religion, not too heavy. You know,

193
00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:06.200
us sing a few him and his safe things. There's a guy, Jesus, the Jew,

194
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.770
the Jesus guy, the Yeshua, his real name is gesture. Um, I love him.

195
00:11:09.771 --> 00:11:13.610
I think he's great guy, you know, and, uh, Mohammed Mohammed as well.

196
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.570
They're very interesting guys. They're like Nelson Mandela, like Gandy. Um,

197
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.240
and they've been women as well, great spiritual leaders,

198
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.430
but I just don't think the floaty guys up there.

199
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.740
I don't think this guy who comes down and goes,

200
00:11:24.741 --> 00:11:28.280
now everyone eat cheese or something. You know, I just don't think that.

201
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:32.150
I don't think he's there. I've noticed. He's not. Do you remember?

202
00:11:32.151 --> 00:11:35.480
In the old days we used to say that God lives in the clouds and he was always in

203
00:11:35.481 --> 00:11:35.961
the clouds.

204
00:11:35.961 --> 00:11:39.620
And then we've learned to fly in the last century through the clouds and they

205
00:11:39.621 --> 00:11:44.300
will never say, he's not here. He's not, not ever mentioned.

206
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.490
You know, they should have gotten wet.

207
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.530
<v 0>It's not that it's not on that cloud. And it should have been.</v>

208
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.580
<v 2>Jesus in Abarth. They're going, I'm on just pull the curtains up. You know,</v>

209
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.070
there was no one in the clouds and we always thought they were in the clouds and

210
00:11:57.071 --> 00:12:00.820
whenever something gets disproved, we never make a marker on that.

211
00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:03.550
We just move on and go, Oh, he's further up. He's in the stratosphere.

212
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:08.800
He's on Mars. Now he's three planets over. So I just don't believe in the guy.

213
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.710
<v 0>Edit from, from whom did you inherit.</v>

214
00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.120
<v 2>Sense of humor? This is dad. My dad is a great sense of humor.</v>

215
00:12:15.121 --> 00:12:19.230
He died this year. Mum died 50 years ago. Dad died this year. Um, in my show,

216
00:12:19.231 --> 00:12:21.690
I tell him his final joke. He made a joke.

217
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.810
He phoned my brother up and told him this joke. And, uh,

218
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.680
but he still had the sense of humor and he was still,

219
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:32.360
they had lesions on his head because he, because he had a bit of skin cancer,

220
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.250
he'd been in a very hot country for eight years in Yemen where we were born.

221
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:36.121
And they said,

222
00:12:36.121 --> 00:12:38.550
you're going to have to have that dealt with by a plastic surgeon.

223
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.120
And then he said, okay, we said, he's not actually made of plastic. Is he?

224
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.450
And he was still coming out with funny lines,

225
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.080
even though he was not having a great time of life. But yeah,

226
00:12:49.081 --> 00:12:52.380
he he's the sense of humor, but my brother's got the same sense of humor. How,

227
00:12:52.381 --> 00:12:56.700
how close were you as a family? Um, we were close in a kind of,

228
00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:01.350
kind of slightly British way, slightly pulled back emotionally the way. Um,

229
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.380
yeah, there's a strong bond of love there.

230
00:13:04.381 --> 00:13:09.090
And we loved our mother and mum went so long ago now, but, um,

231
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.680
yeah, so it was great.

232
00:13:10.681 --> 00:13:13.620
And my brother said he wrote an obituary for the newspaper.

233
00:13:13.621 --> 00:13:17.310
Local newspaper said, if you can't get to choose your parents,

234
00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:21.900
but if we had been allowed to choose our father, we would have chosen him.

235
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:23.880
And that was very nice for my brother.

236
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:31.470
<v 0>[Inaudible] similar to your father.</v>

237
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:37.440
<v 2>Yeah. Um, I will. Um, yeah, I think so.</v>

238
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:42.570
It was quite similar. He was also really active and a hard worker.

239
00:13:42.571 --> 00:13:46.740
So did he train you hard? Was he like a, this? No.

240
00:13:46.741 --> 00:13:49.830
He never push us. They wouldn't push it. No. Absolutely.

241
00:13:49.831 --> 00:13:54.750
He was never standing with the award shore. He drives to the training, uh,

242
00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.500
smoking and look in the race. He was calm guy and, uh,

243
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:01.860
no pressure from the parents at all. So that was, I was really lucky.

244
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.780
<v 0>Um, Eddie, I have to ask you before we move on here. Um, you,</v>

245
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.740
you, you talk a lot about animals. Do you keep it on or are you,

246
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.930
do you like it?

247
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:18.350
<v 2>Yes. Yes. I I'd like to feel,</v>

248
00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.420
I could walk up to a tiger and say hello and look him in the eye.

249
00:14:21.421 --> 00:14:22.320
But I think he'd eat me.

250
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:28.260
<v 0>What do you think if, if, as you are, you aren't a politician, right?</v>

251
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.440
<v 2>I'm going to be a politician after 2020,</v>

252
00:14:31.441 --> 00:14:34.380
I'm standing to be a member of parliament after first general election after

253
00:14:34.381 --> 00:14:35.250
2020. But I.

254
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.040
<v 0>[Inaudible], I'm sorry, but these people came about the moon.</v>

255
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.730
<v 2>No one, but in a spiritual way, you can,</v>

256
00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:49.441
but no,

257
00:14:49.441 --> 00:14:52.130
but I think maybe the applause is not necessary because they may not know my

258
00:14:52.131 --> 00:14:55.850
politics, but I'm I'm for the many, not for the view. I'm for humanity.

259
00:14:55.851 --> 00:14:59.900
I'm for this century, we have a world where 7.5 billion people.

260
00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:02.480
Everyone has a fair chance. That's what I'm fighting for.

261
00:15:02.481 --> 00:15:04.910
And I'm trying to live it. I'm trying to live politics.

262
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:06.950
So I'm performing in French and German and Spanish.

263
00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.080
I want to perform in Arabic and Russian.

264
00:15:09.081 --> 00:15:13.550
I want to reach over to other countries and say, hi, and can you learn from us?

265
00:15:13.551 --> 00:15:16.010
Can we learn from you? What can we all learn together? What can we,

266
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:18.650
we're all human beings. We come from the same place.

267
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.590
And I'm looking for the connections as opposed to the separations.

268
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.310
I think Brexit, Trump hate it's for separation for we're better than you.

269
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.770
That nationalism, that old thing of the thirties.

270
00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.350
And we know what happened in the thirties. If you pick up a book,

271
00:15:30.351 --> 00:15:32.930
you know what happened? So it's just not the place to go.

272
00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:34.760
So I will fight against that everywhere.

273
00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.140
<v 1>[Inaudible] a thought experiment. If our,</v>

274
00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:48.190
our animals here in Britain were able to vote.

275
00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:52.630
If we gave them the right to vote, where would you put them on the, on the map?

276
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:56.020
Uh, what would they be politicals? Right? Who's left.

277
00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.510
<v 2>That's a very silly question. You realize that?</v>

278
00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.130
I think they all vote against Brexit.

279
00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:09.130
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

280
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.920
<v 2>I am quite sure with my connection with the animals.</v>

281
00:16:11.921 --> 00:16:14.530
I say some of them wouldn't be sure, but I've got them. And I'd say,

282
00:16:14.531 --> 00:16:18.640
Mr. Tayga Mr. Kenney, the drive. Just,

283
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:22.510
just trust me on this. We humanity. We and the animals.

284
00:16:22.511 --> 00:16:24.430
We've got to do a partnership, baby. We've got to head forwards.

285
00:16:24.431 --> 00:16:25.750
We've got to go forward rather than backwards.

286
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.840
You can't go forwards if you go backwards. So, and they would go. Yeah.

287
00:16:28.841 --> 00:16:33.350
Yeah man. Yeah. The cats though. No,

288
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:38.200
not the big cats. Not even some of the small ones. Okay.

289
00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.410
Whenever they let you down. No. Would they they've vote their own way.

290
00:16:41.411 --> 00:16:45.910
They'd probably abstain. Thank you so much.

291
00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:53.470
<v 1>[Inaudible] hope you enjoyed the clip for more interesting conversations,</v>
