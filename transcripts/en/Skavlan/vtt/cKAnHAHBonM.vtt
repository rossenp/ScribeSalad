WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.120
<v 0>I suppose this might be a first for you as well,</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.990
but on the forest talk show in the forest. Yeah. That's for sure. I,

3
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.370
you know, I tried to find the perfect compromise.

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.560
So sort of wilderness and sort of studio the wilderness is for you.

5
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:17.520
The studio is for me.

6
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.080
<v 1>It's very nice place to be. There's nothing like trees really.</v>

7
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.660
And in the middle of the city, they're even more precious. Yeah.

8
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.940
What would you say is your favorite place on earth home? Wherever that may be,

9
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.190
but home. Yes. But is that a part apart from home

10
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.880
Europe? Because, uh, you know, I,

11
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.810
I don't enjoy I'm here. I'm in Scandinavia.

12
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.480
I should be saying it's wonderful to be cold, but, um,

13
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.370
I don't enjoy the cold particularly. I mean, it's bracing to a degree, but, uh,

14
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.130
I don't enjoy being frozen stiff. I mean,

15
00:00:55.131 --> 00:00:59.450
I've been to both of the North pole and the South pole and, um,

16
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.590
it's a relief to come out from those temperatures as far as I'm concerned,

17
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.040
but equally I don't like it being boiling hot either.

18
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.290
So Europe's pretty good to me.

19
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.480
<v 0>You you're here because the perfect world foundation has honored you with,</v>

20
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.410
with, with, uh, uh,

21
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.780
price being the conservation is not there. Well,

22
00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:23.990
that's very flattering, but is, is that what you,

23
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.760
what you identify if I, as a, as a conservationist first and foremost.

24
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.990
<v 1>I think first and foremost, I'm a television producer.</v>

25
00:01:32.991 --> 00:01:35.240
I make television programs. Um,

26
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.940
but before I was a television producer, I was a zoologist, uh,

27
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.820
and a naturalist and the natural world means a lot to me.

28
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.990
And to be able to spend my life combining those two things, uh,

29
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.230
has been great luck. Of course, when I was studying psychology,

30
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.920
there wasn't any television. I mean, people say, sometimes say to me,

31
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.810
did you always want to be on television? I said, my dead boil go.

32
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.790
When I was your age, there was no television. And they'd say what? No,

33
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.390
no.

34
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.180
<v 0>It was actually your, your first break was, was when they,</v>

35
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.580
when they wanted to test television. Wasn't it?

36
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.920
That was when you got your first break in the middle?

37
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.450
<v 1>Well, uh, I, the end of the war,</v>

38
00:02:20.451 --> 00:02:24.350
I served in the Navy for, for a couple of years and description. And I,

39
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.050
then I tried to work in scientific publishing,

40
00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:30.400
which was extremely boring Sam's books. Uh,

41
00:02:30.401 --> 00:02:35.330
and then I tried to join radio cause I'd never seen television and I

42
00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:38.360
didn't get that job either. And then the people in the BBC said,

43
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.560
why don't you try, we've got this new thing, just starting it called television.

44
00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:46.790
Would you like to try? And I said, well, why not? I mean, that was in 1952.

45
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.250
And, um, I, uh, uh, uh,

46
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.910
learn how to make Pokemons and started making programs eventually in,

47
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.040
in the tropics about animals.

48
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.070
I really to see a jungle jungle. I thought we had exciting,

49
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.720
quite wrong ideas. Of course,

50
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:07.660
I thought there'd be monkeys hanging from every tree and the snakes,

51
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:11.860
wherever you put foot. This isn't like that at all course. But, um,

52
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.730
but nonetheless, just seeing, seeing the natural world,

53
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.940
the richness of the lateral world, I mean, Europe's fine,

54
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.050
but it's not as rich as the jungle. And that's very exciting.

55
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.440
<v 0>You you've even met animals that no longer exist.</v>

56
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.880
I'm thinking about the tortilla is called, called lonesome George.

57
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.530
<v 1>Well, he, he was, he was, uh, uh, uh,</v>

58
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.900
sub species of, um, uh,

59
00:03:36.901 --> 00:03:39.750
one particular group of Galapagos tortoises.

60
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.030
And he was at his true,

61
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.710
the last survivor and it was very touching to see this poor old

62
00:03:46.711 --> 00:03:48.900
guy. Uh, he,

63
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.860
we had thought that the whole species was extinct a long time ago and then this

64
00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:57.480
old tortoise in a very, very old and doddery,

65
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.140
you know, and he, and they found him on this one Island,

66
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.670
which is the one Island where, where that sub species had evolved.

67
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.380
And they bought him back on the China,

68
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.550
tried to introduce him to females of another closely related species,

69
00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:13.380
but we're all George either,

70
00:04:13.381 --> 00:04:16.980
whether he was just too old or whether he just thought there's not the same,

71
00:04:16.981 --> 00:04:19.890
you know, not like the girls I used to them. Um,

72
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.700
and then one day he just here, we don't know how old he was,

73
00:04:23.701 --> 00:04:26.550
but he was sitting there a hundred years old more. Yeah.

74
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.950
<v 0>Would you say after seeing what you've seen through the years,</v>

75
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.430
um, that you are, uh,

76
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.110
more of an optimist or a pessimist when it comes to what was

77
00:04:40.111 --> 00:04:42.600
happening to the climate and to the animals?

78
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.310
<v 1>Do you know? I,</v>

79
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.110
I try and think about that question because

80
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.810
even if I was a pessimist,

81
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.550
I would still have to do everything I can possibly do to help this

82
00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.560
current situation that we're in. I mean, it doesn't help to say, um,

83
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.910
Oh, we're all doomed. If you say that you say, Oh, I will forget it. You know?

84
00:05:05.911 --> 00:05:10.170
And, uh, and I can't say that, um, and I am,

85
00:05:10.171 --> 00:05:14.550
I am sure things are going to get worse before they get better. Uh,

86
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.200
but I believe they can get better. I believe sufficient of, um,

87
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.101
an optimist,

88
00:05:20.101 --> 00:05:24.960
I suppose to think that human beings really can have,

89
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.340
they know, we know what has to be done. You know? Um,

90
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.330
the question is, we've got to convince the world that they've got to do them.

91
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.040
<v 0>But are,</v>

92
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:39.450
are we as a species able to work together

93
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.490
to go another way?

94
00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.970
<v 1>Well, we never have, well, it's not quite true. We have, um, uh,</v>

95
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.380
certain sections of that, uh, of the world we have done,

96
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.970
we have sorted out. I mean, for example, wailing, you know, at the end,

97
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.180
the war, 1946, 47,

98
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.430
it was pretty clear that we were taking so many whales out of the ocean,

99
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.720
that there were some species where we can to become extinct. Um,

100
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.490
and, uh, the international whaling commission was set up of all countries,

101
00:06:13.491 --> 00:06:17.120
including the Scandinavian countries, uh, where in fact, I mean,

102
00:06:17.121 --> 00:06:18.940
it's easy for Britain to say these things.

103
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.600
We didn't have a big wedding industry really, but you did. Uh,

104
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.520
and, uh, and,

105
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.690
but it took 40 years before. In fact,

106
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.040
the nations find this at, okay, we will stop waiting with certain exceptions,

107
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.990
but by and large, and of course the results have been spectacular. I mean,

108
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:43.670
there are, the whales are now back in the ocean. All the species are too.

109
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.640
And some of them, which we thought were, were really very rare,

110
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:49.670
indeed are now in big numbers.

111
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.110
We have demonstrated that we can, the nations, well, we can get together. Yeah.

112
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.280
<v 0>But this, I mean, uh, for, for, uh, to,</v>

113
00:06:59.281 --> 00:07:00.310
to save the climate,

114
00:07:00.311 --> 00:07:04.420
many people would claim that we all have to change our way of life. It's uh,

115
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.920
it's, uh, I mean, not eating well, that's not a big sacrifice for most people.

116
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.290
<v 1>No, that's true. But in fact,</v>

117
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.620
not making money is quite a big sacrifice for people.

118
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:15.940
Cause that's what that was about.

119
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.170
Wasn't about what you enjoyed eating well meat. It was making money.

120
00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:21.370
That was the part.

121
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.970
<v 0>Um, have you, have you, after all you've seen and</v>

122
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.220
the experience that you have, have you changed your way of life?

123
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.270
Are you, do you have an awareness in your daily life?

124
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.700
<v 1>I would think so. I would hope so.</v>

125
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.540
The trouble is when you get old you're young chapter, so you don't know,

126
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.380
but as you get old things change, the fact is that I, I,

127
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:49.780
all my life I've eaten meat until about five,

128
00:07:49.781 --> 00:07:53.920
10 years ago. I still eat meat on occasion, but by and large,

129
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.820
I don't eat meat in the way that I did. Um,

130
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.810
because of your love for animals or is it no, I don't know what it is,

131
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.580
but I just don't. The great evil is waste. You know,

132
00:08:06.581 --> 00:08:11.290
this world is a hugely rich, productive situation.

133
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.870
There's plenty for everybody if we don't waste it.

134
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.460
And it's the waste that goes on. That is so appalling. I mean,

135
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:27.450
I mean, I remember during the war, we heard stories of America,

136
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.690
we were all starving.

137
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.640
We've heard stories of American ordering huge steaks and then actually nibbling

138
00:08:33.641 --> 00:08:37.530
the end of it and stubbing their cigarettes out on them render. Um, and,

139
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:42.160
and that sort of gross wastefulness. Wastefulness is the evil.

140
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.250
If we stop wasting things, there's plenty for everybody.

141
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.690
<v 0>If, I mean, some people claim that</v>

142
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.740
the problems are exaggerated. Uh, what would the con the,

143
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:57.780
the environment,

144
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.790
some people even say that the climate crisis is that it's a big hoax. Um,

145
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:08.310
the, the American president is one of them. Uh, if I was him, if,

146
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:10.560
if you sat here with him now, what would you say to him?

147
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.870
<v 1>I dunno what I could say to president Trump. I know what I said.</v>

148
00:09:14.871 --> 00:09:19.040
I did say to president Obama and, and, and he agreed,

149
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:24.050
uh, about the problems of the world facing the, um,

150
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.470
it's a philosophical thing, isn't it. If you're talking about climate change,

151
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.410
you you've only got to look at the facts. It's very dangerous.

152
00:09:33.411 --> 00:09:36.860
Look at one set of facts. I mean, if I said,

153
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.250
I can take to a place in, in the,

154
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.670
in the Antarctic where, when I first went there,

155
00:09:43.671 --> 00:09:47.930
the Garcia came down to the sea and now I go look what it is now he would

156
00:09:47.931 --> 00:09:49.400
equally well say, well,

157
00:09:49.401 --> 00:09:52.550
there's another place on the other side of the Antarctic where it's not the soup

158
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:56.750
versus happen. If you only take one example, you're in trouble.

159
00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:02.090
But if you look at the holistic statistics in an intelligence and sophisticated

160
00:10:02.091 --> 00:10:06.940
way, the answer is absolutely clear. Um, and, and, um,

161
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.990
10 years ago, I would certainly have said that I now beginning to able to say,

162
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:16.070
just look at the facts now, just, just look at world temperatures. Now,

163
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.110
just look at sea temperatures. Now,

164
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:22.700
just look at the consequences of the certification with thousands of poor

165
00:10:22.701 --> 00:10:26.150
people, because their lands have become totally unproductive.

166
00:10:26.151 --> 00:10:28.910
But now that mixed up with politics too,

167
00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:32.090
but now are crossing the Mediterranean and try to come into Europe.

168
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.260
<v 0>See then again, they have alternative facts. That's the thing.</v>

169
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.650
They have always some climate skeptic.

170
00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.350
So there will always be a discussion. Isn't that? The big, I don't,

171
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.600
I think that you can't agree on, on basics. Okay.

172
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:52.100
<v 1>The process advances, there are guns collapsed, progressively.</v>

173
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:57.440
The trouble is if it's going to take so long for you to wait for

174
00:10:57.441 --> 00:11:00.590
all the facts on overwhelming facts for them to convince them,

175
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.800
it may then be too late. That's, that's the worry.

176
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:10.790
<v 0>Yeah. You've met more animals than, than most of us David. And, um,</v>

177
00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.790
I wonder which one did you have the best chemistry with?

178
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.060
<v 1>I don't have chemistry with animals really, particularly. I mean, do you mean,</v>

179
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.850
uh, that I could have go up and Pat.

180
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.430
<v 0>I've seen you quite intimate with the animals.</v>

181
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.730
I remember some pictures of you and some gorillas, and

182
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:37.550
you're a part of the family. No offense, but I mean, there's so much.

183
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:42.290
<v 1>No, of course, but it's easy to empathize with our closest relationships,</v>

184
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:46.100
of course, but you can't empathize, um, with, with a millipede.

185
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.910
And actually it's difficult to empathize with a bird who may an,

186
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.560
you may and try and persuade yourself that you think the same way as a or a

187
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:57.340
power thinks the same way as you and there are, as far as parents are concerned,

188
00:11:57.341 --> 00:11:59.800
certain parallels, but by and large,

189
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.130
the more remote we are in an evolutionary sense with animals,

190
00:12:03.131 --> 00:12:07.840
the less chance you have of actually communicating with them with mammos.

191
00:12:07.841 --> 00:12:12.090
Yes, sure. And among mammals and primates, the monkeys and the,

192
00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.710
and the apes. Yeah. Even, even more so.

193
00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.640
<v 0>W when I, when I see you with those gorillas,</v>

194
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.700
I think about the smell

195
00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.730
because very few people has been so close. Yes.

196
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.030
And that kind of animal, I just wonder how did it smell?

197
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:34.290
<v 1>No, rather nice. Actually, I quite like the smell of, of primates</v>

198
00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:37.590
when they do, it's a kind of salty smell,

199
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.700
apes smell rather texted. I mean,

200
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:46.530
I just didn't want deal would call a particularly attractive as well.

201
00:12:46.531 --> 00:12:47.580
But if you, like,

202
00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:51.960
if you like gorillas or I moved on particularly alright,

203
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.830
lovely. I mean, really very attractive creatures.

204
00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.900
<v 0>Did, did you ever come home with some exotic diseases or something?</v>

205
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:05.070
<v 1>I came home from, from Indonesia, um,</v>

206
00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:10.320
and having been away for four months. And in those days without a contact,

207
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:14.370
you know, we had no international phones and so on. And, uh,

208
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:15.990
and I I've been traveling,

209
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:21.240
took a long time to fly back from Borneo and my eventually got home

210
00:13:21.241 --> 00:13:25.320
late at night. Um, and, uh, and, uh, I went to bed,

211
00:13:25.321 --> 00:13:29.100
my wife was lying alongside me and I woke up at about three o'clock in the

212
00:13:29.101 --> 00:13:33.990
morning, pouring sweat. And I thought, this is it.

213
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:38.760
I mean, this is what I've read about. This is malaria, you know? And, uh,

214
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:43.050
and Marla, what do I do to our nudge and say, I've got malaria darling,

215
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:47.850
or what will I do? And I put my hand on the sheet and it was,

216
00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:52.710
he was red hot almost. And I suddenly discovered that

217
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:59.130
while I've been away, my wife had bought electric blankets with dual control

218
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.830
and mine was still on.

219
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.680
So you were quite okay. I was okay.

220
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:16.380
<v 0>Having, having the, the one, the lust that you obviously have, uh,</v>

221
00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:21.210
has that made you more restless? Uh, when you, when you were back in back home.

222
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:27.150
<v 1>Um, I've calmed down a bit when you're in your nineties, you know, um,</v>

223
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:33.210
I've, I've, I've, I'm so lucky what a fantastically,

224
00:14:33.211 --> 00:14:36.480
lucky time I've had, you know, I've been everywhere. I really want to be,

225
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:40.830
except perhaps I would like to been to the Gobi desert. Um,

226
00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:44.160
I've been on the edges of the Gabby. Does it, uh, the BBC,

227
00:14:44.161 --> 00:14:47.370
the bull costing people will never send television would never send me to the

228
00:14:47.371 --> 00:14:49.620
central, the Gobi because there's no animals,

229
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:54.560
but a wonderful bothers dinosaur, fast, a little passionate.

230
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:56.750
I love trying to force off.

231
00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:58.850
<v 0>Just not great television though.</v>

232
00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:03.260
<v 1>No, no, it takes time. That's not good. And even when you find it,</v>

233
00:15:03.261 --> 00:15:04.790
it doesn't do anything spectacular.

234
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:10.600
<v 0>Your, your life has been, I mean, so much traveling so much,</v>

235
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.500
so many farewells, uh, it must've been,

236
00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:17.800
it must've been like daily, daily life for you to say,

237
00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.420
bye-bye I see you in four months.

238
00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:25.180
<v 1>Um, well, it was increasingly increasingly hard.</v>

239
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.870
Um, and particularly when you have a family, uh,

240
00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:33.040
saying goodbye for four months is hard. Um,

241
00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:37.480
four months was as far as long as I ever went away, and then they got shorter.

242
00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:38.620
And as,

243
00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:43.390
as airlines became more widespread and more reliable,

244
00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.980
you were able to get back even just quickly for Fortnite, you know,

245
00:15:47.981 --> 00:15:49.860
so you could, and so the,

246
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:53.940
the four months trips began to shrink and they shouldn't the three months and

247
00:15:53.941 --> 00:15:57.310
the two month now, I don't go away for more than about two weeks from time,

248
00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.530
two or three weeks time, because wherever you go,

249
00:15:59.531 --> 00:16:01.390
you can get back fairly quickly.

250
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:05.590
<v 0>And also becoming 92, as you are now,</v>

251
00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:10.360
there has been some per worlds that is forever for you.

252
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:12.580
Which-which has been the most difficult for you.

253
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:17.710
<v 1>Well, if, um, I mean, losing your wife is, is, um,</v>

254
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.820
a traumatic and devastating experience,

255
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.500
um, and which, um, would cost the long shadow.

256
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.350
Um, um,

257
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:34.240
that's the closest loss I've had in losing your parents and losing

258
00:16:34.241 --> 00:16:38.800
my brother, um, uh, is also a great shock. Richard, the filmmaker.

259
00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:39.783
Yes.

260
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:43.600
<v 0>You, you, you were traveling one year when your wife passed away, right?</v>

261
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.980
<v 1>No. Well, I, I got back in time. Well, I got him back on time.</v>

262
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.970
She was in hospital. Yeah.

263
00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:51.820
<v 0>How did that change your life?</v>

264
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.690
<v 1>Um, well profoundly of course. Um,</v>

265
00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:01.300
on the other hand, the children, um,

266
00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:05.710
my son and my daughter were BookBub grown up and established in their various

267
00:17:05.711 --> 00:17:09.070
careers. Um, and, um,

268
00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:14.050
uh, I, I'm not a very domesticated person. I'm not a, not much of a co I'm,

269
00:17:14.051 --> 00:17:18.730
no sort of a cook. Uh, and, um, had I,

270
00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:26.080
my daughter who was ahead of, uh, uh, primary school, uh,

271
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:28.120
had teacher, um,

272
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:33.520
eventually we're not all at quite soon came to sort me out

273
00:17:33.521 --> 00:17:36.400
in terms of, of cooking one thing or another,

274
00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:41.530
and she now runs the house and so

275
00:17:41.531 --> 00:17:43.510
on. So that's, um,

276
00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:48.370
a blessing and the God sandwich for which I'm profoundly grateful.

277
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.150
Um, and very, very lucky.

278
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.250
<v 0>You're not, you're not a religious person,</v>

279
00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.560
but you don't call yourself an atheist either.

280
00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.410
What do you think happens when we die?

281
00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.890
<v 1>Oh, I, I think nothing happens between</v>

282
00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:10.370
I'm working on that basis. Um, I,

283
00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.380
I I'm,

284
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:17.480
I'm not an atheist in the sense that I say with confidence and,

285
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.980
and true belief that there is no, God, I think very much,

286
00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:27.550
I once made a film about termites. Um, and you know,

287
00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:32.890
they build these huge Hills and I took my

288
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:37.220
Chet head and cut the top off so that we could see inside and there were all

289
00:18:37.221 --> 00:18:41.360
these termites or busier. Um, and, um,

290
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.240
I suddenly thought, you know,

291
00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.380
they can have no idea. Then I am looking at the,

292
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.610
as anything else other than being, like being a termite, uh,

293
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:56.300
because they can't see above anything else. So these are,

294
00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:57.890
these are blind workers,

295
00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:03.440
so they don't know this is happening and it's not that they're stupid or

296
00:19:03.441 --> 00:19:07.220
faithless or something, but they don't have the senses that particular sense.

297
00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.930
And I can't help thinking there's a possibility that we don't have a particular

298
00:19:11.931 --> 00:19:14.630
sentence. There may be, there is somebody out there.

299
00:19:14.631 --> 00:19:17.780
Maybe there is a top of a up there,

300
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.350
people are looking down on us and wondering what we're doing and try and

301
00:19:21.351 --> 00:19:24.740
working. You know, I don't know how can I say because I have no substance.

302
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:29.300
So I am resistant to saying pontifically

303
00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:34.790
and positively without question, there is no Cod, I cannot say that.

304
00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:39.350
<v 0>You recently did a scene with a satellite.</v>

305
00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.200
<v 1>Well, th th the idea was a notion that these days you can actually,</v>

306
00:19:45.201 --> 00:19:49.070
from a satellite, you can actually monitor an elephant. I mean,

307
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:52.520
using a satellite up in the miles, up in the sky,

308
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:57.440
there is now technology when a labeled you to recognize an individual elephant.

309
00:19:57.441 --> 00:20:02.000
So from a, from a conservation point of view, it's a very valuable tool.

310
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:07.610
And to, uh, demonstrate this, uh, we thought we'd set up all the producer,

311
00:20:07.611 --> 00:20:11.530
thought it set up above position when he rang up, uh,

312
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.390
got in touch with a firm that runs the satellites.

313
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:20.030
And can we book a time in which we could get a satellite shot

314
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:25.460
of our television, presented that to say me in one particular place by the,

315
00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:28.670
on the banks of the Zambezi river. Um,

316
00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:33.290
and so we could come down from the world and you'd see other Africa, Africa,

317
00:20:33.291 --> 00:20:36.430
and then you'll see the Zambizi you go further in and renting say,

318
00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.510
Landrover that alongside the Landrover, you'll see a person.

319
00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:42.320
You could see it was me. And then you'll cut. And I would say, well,

320
00:20:42.321 --> 00:20:47.150
here I am on the, but real. So that meant that you had to have a particular

321
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.750
to within a second. Uh, so when in fact the satellite would be there,

322
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:53.681
you had the book,

323
00:20:53.681 --> 00:20:58.060
it was going to cost a lot of money in order to do this particular shot and

324
00:20:58.061 --> 00:21:01.120
everything would be set up. So I want, uh, two minutes,

325
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.920
31 minutes and 15 seconds, you had to be there.

326
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:08.740
And as whatever time was,

327
00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:12.760
the time we poached the produce was hiding under a Bush, C,

328
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:16.540
and he was coming out. And he said that, uh, two minutes ago,

329
00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:21.400
then w woman is 30 to go, uh, one minute to go getting ready.

330
00:21:21.401 --> 00:21:24.520
And that moment, this was on the remote as part one,

331
00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.860
prepare a remote part of Africa on the zombie.

332
00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:31.780
And Andrea was suddenly came out in the Bush and we had

333
00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:36.700
45 seconds ago. And I said, go away, go, go away.

334
00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:41.650
And, and, uh, a very pretty lady let out of the window and said, Oh, hi.

335
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:46.480
I said, look, I just go. And she said, it's David. I said,

336
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.790
I said, go see where they, the producer, the producer shot out.

337
00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:56.590
Wow. She drove, it didn't know what happened. And we lost her.

338
00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:01.150
Never found her again. And so she still got low. I thought, Oh,

339
00:22:01.151 --> 00:22:06.040
we call it the picture. All right. So when do we get to see, I don't know.

340
00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.000
