00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.690
<v 0>Chief fire officer and somebody is not coming out and welcome to the show.</v>

2
00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:04.524
Welcome.

3
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.390
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.300
<v 0>We have to talk about your exceptional story. Uh,</v>

5
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.890
I mean, how you became what you are today, but, but first of all,

6
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.770
try to describe for me, if I, if I were to walk with you, uh,

7
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.120
into, uh, a fire in a house, I was dressed for it.

8
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.430
What would I experience?

9
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.490
<v 2>You know, it's interesting because with firefighters,</v>

10
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.510
firefighters are running in when every human instinct is to run out.

11
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.910
So we train a lot. So we're prepared when we go into that kind of environment.

12
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.860
But if I can help you to imagine it,

13
00:00:48.861 --> 00:00:51.020
not just from the perspective of the firefighter,

14
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.960
but from the perspective of the person that's trapped inside,

15
00:00:53.961 --> 00:00:55.310
that needs us to go and help.

16
00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.140
And what they'll be experiencing is darkness because the smoke comes

17
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:04.760
down very, very low. So it's very difficult to see for a firefighter.

18
00:01:04.761 --> 00:01:08.150
We can't see in front of our mask, we can't see our hands, nothing.

19
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.280
So all of your senses are taken away.

20
00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:14.870
You can't hear anything because you've got the breathing apparatus on and all

21
00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:17.810
you can really hear is the noise from that, or the noise from the fire.

22
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.970
You can't smell anything because we have the mask that's covering our face so

23
00:01:22.971 --> 00:01:24.170
that we can breathe air.

24
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.690
But then what you feel is the heat and the heat can be extremely intense.

25
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.340
So you imagine a situation where all of your senses are taken away from you.

26
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.740
It's hot and it's uncomfortable,

27
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.790
but you have to push on because you know that there's somebody in there that

28
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:44.270
doesn't have the same protection that we do. Who's relying on you.

29
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:48.170
And you're the only thing standing between helping them to go out and be with

30
00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:52.700
their family and their loved ones and have another normal day or that being the

31
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.510
end.

32
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.343
<v 0>Is it noisy?</v>

33
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.510
<v 2>Uh, it can be because the, the fire can be very noisy depending on where it is.</v>

34
00:01:59.511 --> 00:02:00.560
It can be quite crackling.

35
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.930
But the other thing that's very noisy for us when we're in,

36
00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:06.350
there is our breathing operator sets because you hear the constant hiss of air.

37
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.610
So it can be quite difficult to communicate as well. Plus you've got the diving.

38
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.860
It's exactly that. Yeah, exactly. That, but.

39
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.960
<v 0>What is it? Is it, is it, is it chaotic?</v>

40
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.730
Is it a feeling of chaos?

41
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.230
<v 2>Um, I wouldn't say it's chaotic. Um,</v>

42
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.030
I think there's order within it,

43
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.390
but I think normality is removed for that period.

44
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.390
So it's an incredibly challenging environment.

45
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.420
And the other thing that you experienced,

46
00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:37.520
depending on how you're coping with the situation,

47
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.430
you can experience some quite extreme set stress.

48
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.350
And when you experienced stress,

49
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.080
it reduces the processing capacity in your brain.

50
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.500
So what we find is you can be very focused on the here and now,

51
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.350
but not necessarily anticipating what might come next.

52
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.920
<v 0>So how, how would, would your mindset be as, uh,</v>

53
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.970
as a trained a firefighting, how the mindset be when you go in there,

54
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.010
it would be incredibly.

55
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.830
<v 2>Focused. We train incredibly hard.</v>

56
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:06.310
So in terms of our processes and procedure, they're drilled into you,

57
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:08.620
like it's second nature. So from that perspective,

58
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.450
you do what you're trained to do,

59
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.610
but the biggest part for us is the empathy that you feel for whoever is relying

60
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:17.920
on you to be in there. And I tell you,

61
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:21.460
there is no bigger driver for us, I think,

62
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.260
than experiencing the loss from the perspective of the people outside.

63
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:31.150
Because when you see that human face of hope, just ever way,

64
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:32.710
when you come out empty handed,

65
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.520
there is no bigger driver for going back in or making sure that you don't come

66
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.710
out empty handed next time. And actually,

67
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:43.480
I have to say that I so admire the courage of you and your sister

68
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.870
having experienced the loss that you have and talking about it.

69
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.760
So openly with such courage helps so many other people who've been in a similar

70
00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:53.710
position. So, so thank you for your strength.

71
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.830
<v 0>[Inaudible], uh, your PhD is about this stress,</v>

72
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.540
this the, the, the,

73
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.880
the challenge of making the sessions in stressful situations,

74
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.120
uh, and it was important for you to study this on your, your study has been,

75
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.580
uh, international air claimed and,

76
00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.440
and a very important tool for firefighters all over the world. Um, and I,

77
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.330
I wonder, uh, what, what happens with us? I mean,

78
00:04:30.331 --> 00:04:34.260
in stressful situations, how are our abilities limited?

79
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.690
<v 2>Well, it's interesting, you know, because when we started doing this,</v>

80
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:40.140
this research, so this was kind of all after the PhD,

81
00:04:40.141 --> 00:04:43.110
we started to do some research all across the UK,

82
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.160
and it was the first time we'd ever been able to do research at an incident

83
00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:50.130
ground because I was a firefighter first, before I studied this.

84
00:04:50.131 --> 00:04:53.640
So you can kind of go into the dangerous environments that typically scientists

85
00:04:53.641 --> 00:04:56.520
can't go into. It's like, Oh, I know I'm a scientist. It's like, no, not here.

86
00:04:56.521 --> 00:04:57.750
You're not bait. So off you go.

87
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.930
So we were quite fortunate from that perspective. Um,

88
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.980
so we were able to collect data from the scene of operations and what we

89
00:05:04.981 --> 00:05:07.080
discovered was absolutely revolutionary.

90
00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:11.130
We found that when we're making decisions in that kind of an environment,

91
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.150
80% of the time, we're making guts, intuitive decisions,

92
00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:17.610
we're not balancing all of the different options.

93
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.510
And coming up with an analytical decision, it's a gut decision.

94
00:05:21.511 --> 00:05:24.840
We're responding based on our experience, our, what,

95
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.320
it might be a particular cue in the environment, but critically for us,

96
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.370
we were taking one piece of the jigsaw and reacting to that rather than putting

97
00:05:32.371 --> 00:05:34.050
it into the big picture. Now,

98
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.280
I know from experience that if you're not thinking about the big picture,

99
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.280
and if you haven't got that really clear picture of what's going on,

100
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:42.690
people can get hurt.

101
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.370
And I had some personal experience of that when my husband and I were both

102
00:05:47.371 --> 00:05:48.390
firefighters together,

103
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.380
and one day I was called to an incident where a firefighter had been very

104
00:05:52.381 --> 00:05:56.370
severely burned and there was a one in four chance that it was him.

105
00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.770
And it was the most difficult experience I'd ever had. Because for me,

106
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:04.970
I was completely torn between the role of a responder and all of the

107
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:07.040
accountability that comes with it,

108
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.140
and the role of a loved one and all of the human emotion and fear and an

109
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:14.000
anticipation that came with that. Now,

110
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.300
I was really fortunate because it wasn't him that was burned,

111
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:21.950
but it was our friend. And as much as I felt this massive sense of relief,

112
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.780
I also felt this huge sense of guilt,

113
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.320
because I felt like by not wanting it to be him, I'd wished it on somebody else.

114
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.080
And so this was the driver for the research,

115
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.760
because we know actually that 80% of the time when people get injured,

116
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.920
it's because of human error,

117
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.870
not a problem with your equipment or a flawed policy or, or a rubbish procedure,

118
00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:44.930
but a human mistake. And that means people were getting hurt.

119
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.480
<v 0>A human mistake in a stressful situation.</v>

120
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.550
<v 2>Exactly that. So with the research,</v>

121
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:53.330
we were looking at the kind of stressful environment where people could make

122
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:58.190
mistakes to try to understand the human more so we could reduce human error

123
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.720
and actually what we were then able to develop with some techniques that could

124
00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:06.980
help firefighters make better decisions and keep them safer and help them to

125
00:07:06.981 --> 00:07:10.820
move past that single piece of the jigsaw and slot it back into the big picture

126
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.530
and make a decision based on that.

127
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.330
<v 0>Are you saying that bravery is something you can teach and learn?</v>

128
00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.240
<v 2>So it's bravery is an interesting words because the thing about</v>

129
00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:26.800
bravery people assume that I think bravery is kind of fearlessness, right?

130
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.560
You're not afraid of something. And I think it's the opposite.

131
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.610
I think if you're being exactly that you are afraid of something,

132
00:07:33.611 --> 00:07:36.600
but you do it anyway. And that's brave instinct for,

133
00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.420
I think it's like a mindset it's recognizing the fear,

134
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.150
but seeing your pathway through that.

135
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.960
<v 0>So good assess control your feelings.</v>

136
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.330
[inaudible] talk about choosing. Yeah. You can't,

137
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.020
you can't escape fear when you're standing there and everything that the

138
00:08:02.021 --> 00:08:03.730
building is falling down, you know,

139
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:06.280
but you can choose how to deal with that fear.

140
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.320
And that's something you can train. Yeah. Right. So tell me,

141
00:08:11.321 --> 00:08:13.390
who do you become in a stressful situation?

142
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.270
<v 3>Well, it depends on in stressful situations.</v>

143
00:08:16.271 --> 00:08:18.790
I'm quite hysterical and I have four kids.

144
00:08:18.791 --> 00:08:23.410
So my biggest nightmare is that something should happen to them, of course.

145
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.800
But when things happen, when it's people around me always screamed,

146
00:08:26.801 --> 00:08:28.750
like help do something, do something.

147
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:33.670
And I like put my everything on other people.

148
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.910
Have you been in such a sensitive situation? And I told myself,

149
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.260
if something happens to my kids, when I'm alone, they're going to die. I don't,

150
00:08:41.261 --> 00:08:44.920
I'm not going to know what to do. I'm going to like last and screaming.

151
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.750
And then when my youngest daughter was one year, uh,

152
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.700
she got food stuck in her throat.

153
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:57.180
And that's the most thing that I could ever imagine happen.

154
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:02.700
And I saw her and I was alone with them, her and her bigger sister live.

155
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.870
And I just heard a strange noise from the table.

156
00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:10.410
And it should puts like a big noxious ships in her, in her throat.

157
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.770
And then I was totally calm. I was, I had so much fear inside me,

158
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.880
but it was like, okay. And everything that I knew that I had to do,

159
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.250
I did it, everything.

160
00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:28.080
I took her up and I did the thing between her shoulders. Nothing happened.

161
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:33.060
I did, I did everything, but it was really stuck. And I always had like,

162
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.790
hate melon fingers through the pain.

163
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.230
I did that pain. That's a wall. Uh.

164
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:45.290
<v 4>That's a wall. And you don't see any hope from it. That's when you're stuck.</v>

165
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.930
<v 3>Yeah. But I mean, I always thought that I was going to be like, paralyzed.</v>

166
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.310
What did I say? The parallel happened to her,

167
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.230
her eyes turned around and take it just white. And she was blue.

168
00:09:57.231 --> 00:10:00.590
She was that she was just hanging. The thing was still sucks up,

169
00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.790
put my long fingers down the throat. And I felt the thing.

170
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.070
And I like put it on amazing. Pulled it up.

171
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.530
And it came blood and she was still gone. And it was just like,

172
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.940
my child was dying and then she just took a breath.

173
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.470
But she has been long for many minutes. Yeah. Uh,

174
00:10:18.471 --> 00:10:23.090
when the ambulance came and I was sitting in the ambulance and she was crying

175
00:10:23.091 --> 00:10:27.290
and got her color back, Oh my God, I have one more child.

176
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:31.250
She still at the table sits in there. How old is she?

177
00:10:31.251 --> 00:10:34.760
Then she was three and a half. So I had to call my neighbor,

178
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:40.580
my other child so that it wasn't so good in distress. I saved my small one.

179
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:53.540
[inaudible] more hysterical, but I was totally called and did everything right.

180
00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.830
And the doctor said, did everything writes amazing? It was amazing. I was like,

181
00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.380
I, it was amazing. Tell me.

182
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:04.910
<v 4>Can I say something? They're like what Sabrina said,</v>

183
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:10.190
train people. There's so much training equipment,

184
00:11:10.191 --> 00:11:14.150
everything they know what to do. The training is intense. I've seen those.

185
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:18.350
I've been through those am very involved with the forces in India.

186
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:23.120
The training is so intense, but still when the real thing happens,

187
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:29.510
even among soldiers, nearly 60% of them will do all the wrong things.

188
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.290
Only 30 to 40% do what they have to do.

189
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.860
It's because of that situations are saved.

190
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.140
But those 60% will do all the wrong things because somewhere we

191
00:11:42.141 --> 00:11:46.190
believe human emotions are already there. No, we are creating them.

192
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.600
It's up to us. Like she said, in one situation,

193
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:55.090
she is freaking in another situations. She somehow meant in the balance.

194
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.770
Once the balance was there,

195
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.800
your competent is at a different level of what any doctor could do.

196
00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:03.700
You just did without the same level of training, just with information,

197
00:12:03.701 --> 00:12:08.590
probably not with training. So about all balance. If there is no balance,

198
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.820
your own intelligence turns against you. So what you think is fear,

199
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.850
what you think is anger. What do you think is stress? Tension.

200
00:12:15.851 --> 00:12:20.620
Misery is just one thing. Your intelligence has turned against you.

201
00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.790
Once your intelligence has turned against you. There is no hope.

202
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.160
<v 0>Can you relate to that?</v>

203
00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.230
<v 2>I can actually. I mean, it's interesting what you say, and I agree with you.</v>

204
00:12:31.231 --> 00:12:32.460
And that's why for me,

205
00:12:32.461 --> 00:12:35.940
the best training is when you're in an environment that will elicit that emotion

206
00:12:35.941 --> 00:12:39.270
that you know, will be there in the situation that you need to use it in.

207
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.110
Because decision making for me is like a skill. It's like any kind of skill.

208
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.350
You have to train it in the environment that you're going to use it. I mean,

209
00:12:46.351 --> 00:12:49.590
if you want it to swim the channel, if you wanted to swim in the sea,

210
00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.770
then you wouldn't practice in a swimming pool. It's the same skill, right?

211
00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:55.080
It's swimming, but you're using it in a different context.

212
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.580
So you have to train in the environment that will elicit all of those pressures.

213
00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:02.880
So realistic training for me is just so incredibly important.

214
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.770
<v 0>How much, how much training is,</v>

215
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:12.300
how relevant is the fact that you have lived on the streets?

216
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.290
How, what does that give you as a firefighter?

217
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:19.800
<v 2>Um, that's a really good question. And I think for me,</v>

218
00:13:19.801 --> 00:13:22.980
it has certainly formed the way that I view things.

219
00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:27.840
And I think in many respects, it affected the way that I make decisions.

220
00:13:27.841 --> 00:13:32.070
Because one of the things that I'd experienced when I was sleeping rough was a

221
00:13:32.071 --> 00:13:35.070
sense of hyper-vigilance because you know, that there's danger everywhere.

222
00:13:35.071 --> 00:13:38.640
So you're constantly looking for danger. So you become hypervigilant.

223
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:42.480
Now it's a bit thing because you're constantly looking around for stuff and you

224
00:13:42.481 --> 00:13:44.040
can catch things before they happen.

225
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.950
But the downside is it can make you quite anxious sometimes,

226
00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:48.930
but it has got better over the years.

227
00:13:48.931 --> 00:13:52.980
But what I find is there've been a number of occasions when I've been in charge

228
00:13:52.981 --> 00:13:55.680
of large incidents, and there's been a very, very small change,

229
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:57.180
like a change in wind direction.

230
00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.640
And because I'm constantly looking out for stuff,

231
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.900
I've noticed it and we've been able to change the tactics and the situation has

232
00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:04.860
changed for the better.

233
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.630
So I always try to see a positive and I know it might be hard to think that

234
00:14:09.631 --> 00:14:13.050
there could be a positive from kind of experiencing something like homelessness.

235
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.080
And I'll be honest with you. It's a pretty crap time. Um,

236
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:20.280
but actually it is all part of who you are and how it forms you.

237
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:24.810
And I found it incredibly hard to talk about it's taken me,

238
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.960
I'll be honest. It's taken me about 20 years to find the courage,

239
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.410
to speak to people about this. I used to wake up with cold sweats,

240
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.050
worrying that people would know about it. Um,

241
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.870
but I decided to start talking about it this year.

242
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.710
And the timing was strange because you think about, you know,

243
00:14:40.711 --> 00:14:43.950
being a senior fire officer, and I'm a chief fire officer,

244
00:14:43.951 --> 00:14:46.350
I've got my own fire brigade now. And you think, well,

245
00:14:46.351 --> 00:14:49.890
actually you're supposed to be absolutely infallible. You know,

246
00:14:49.891 --> 00:14:51.770
you're supposed to know what to do all the time.

247
00:14:51.771 --> 00:14:54.290
There's got to be no vulnerability there.

248
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.460
And I was standing up in front of people and say, no, I'm vulnerable actually.

249
00:14:58.461 --> 00:14:59.330
And this is why,

250
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:03.470
but I needed to do it because I know that there are still thousands of people

251
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.590
who are in the same place today that I was back then.

252
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.070
And I needed them to know that it doesn't have to define who you are because I

253
00:15:10.071 --> 00:15:13.070
let it define me for a long time, but you don't have to.

254
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.880
And that for me was the most powerful piece that I could do with it. So yes,

255
00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:20.270
it was hard. Yes. It's shaped me in many ways.

256
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.190
Probably many more than I realize,

257
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:26.540
but actually you can always make lemonade if you've got some lemons.

258
00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:34.653
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

259
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:38.410
<v 0>Why, I mean, what happened was that you, you came from,</v>

260
00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:42.790
you had quite a happy childhood, uh, as long as your father were alive.

261
00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.480
And then when he died, everything changed.

262
00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:51.580
<v 2>That's it? Exactly. So he was diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor,</v>

263
00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.370
um, when I was about three years old and then he was,

264
00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.290
he got progressively worse and he died.

265
00:15:56.291 --> 00:16:01.270
Then when I was nine and my mother absolutely adored

266
00:16:01.271 --> 00:16:03.790
him. They were, it, it was like you and Brianne.

267
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:13.450
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

268
00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:17.110
<v 2>Um, they honestly, they absolutely idolized each other. So when he died,</v>

269
00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:21.460
she found it incredibly difficult to cope and people deal with trauma in very

270
00:16:21.461 --> 00:16:22.900
different ways. And for my mother,

271
00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.240
she found it very difficult to deal with at all.

272
00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.700
And she suffered terribly with her mental health.

273
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:30.940
And I think mental health is something that for a long time has had a huge

274
00:16:30.941 --> 00:16:31.420
stigma.

275
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:35.230
And we haven't spoken openly enough about our experiences with this and how it

276
00:16:35.231 --> 00:16:39.610
affects us and what my mother did was kind of closed the doors.

277
00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.300
And I think it's fair to say that if somebody goes to war with their demons,

278
00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:45.760
is everyone around them that gets hit by the shrapnel.

279
00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:50.680
And that was certainly the case in our family and our business broke down and we

280
00:16:50.681 --> 00:16:52.270
lived in abject poverty.

281
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.030
We had a social worker coming back and forth all the time.

282
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.300
I don't know how we didn't end up in the care system if I'm really honest,

283
00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:00.040
but it was really tough.

284
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:04.300
And it got to a point where I couldn't do it there anymore.

285
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:08.050
And that's when I started to sleep rough when I was 15.

286
00:17:08.051 --> 00:17:10.720
I wasn't quite 16 yet at the time. Um.

287
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:13.690
<v 0>What do you mean by sleeping? Rough? How could that be?</v>

288
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:18.550
<v 2>So sleeping outside on the streets basically. Um,</v>

289
00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:23.080
and it was a better alternative to the experience that we were having at home.

290
00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:29.560
<v 0>W was it like, was it dangerous for you? Was it,</v>

291
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.570
I mean, it's for a young woman sleeping on the streets, it's not a safe.

292
00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:37.210
<v 2>Relatively dangerous, incredibly dangerous.</v>

293
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.170
I lost count of the amount of times that I got, uh,

294
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.300
beaten senseless by people.

295
00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:47.110
There were times when I I'll give you an example, one day I,

296
00:17:47.111 --> 00:17:49.170
and this is going to sound really sturdy, but bear with me.

297
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.220
I wanted to go to sleep somewhere light, cause I was just fed up at the Doppler.

298
00:17:53.221 --> 00:17:57.630
So I chose to go to sleep in a subway because you have the lighting in there.

299
00:17:57.631 --> 00:18:01.800
So I put my cardboard down. I had my, my sleeping bag and my little dog,

300
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:06.120
I had a stray dog, stray dog, stray human best of friends. It was great. Um,

301
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:09.570
and he would sleep in the bottom of my sleeping bag and I, I woke up,

302
00:18:09.571 --> 00:18:12.060
it must've been maybe one or two o'clock in the morning. I don't know,

303
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:17.460
but I could feel my sleeping bag was, it felt warm and wet. And,

304
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.270
and initially I thought, Oh great. The dogs done something in here. Um,

305
00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.930
but actually I could hear someone laughing, a drunk guy laughing,

306
00:18:24.931 --> 00:18:26.970
and he was urinating on my sleeping bag.

307
00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.450
And that was the most dehumanizing experience.

308
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:33.930
But see this guy really misjudged this because he didn't know how to dog down

309
00:18:33.931 --> 00:18:37.080
there and you shouldn't wave things around and a dog and an angry dog.

310
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.770
And let's just say, I don't think it'd be winging on anyone anytime soon.

311
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:44.150
<v 3>Um, but, but.</v>

312
00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.070
<v 2>But the practicalities of that,</v>

313
00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:50.570
I had a sleeping bag that was soaked in some guy's urine.

314
00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:55.760
I was 16 years old by this point and I was completely alone.

315
00:18:55.761 --> 00:18:57.140
I had no other clothes.

316
00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:01.460
I had no other sleeping bag and I just went and I sat in the middle of the town

317
00:19:01.461 --> 00:19:01.880
center.

318
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.630
I pulled up my legs like this and I sat on a bench and I just cried for the

319
00:19:05.631 --> 00:19:07.850
whole night until the sun came up the next day.

320
00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:12.860
What can you do that from a practical sense? There was literally nothing.

321
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:15.230
It was really intensely difficult.

322
00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.620
<v 0>And you went to school right? All the time. Yeah.</v>

323
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.850
I mean wouldn't pupils or teachers recognize you on the streets.

324
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.690
<v 2>Well, it's interesting. One of the reasons I kept going to school, um,</v>

325
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:29.720
only until I was 16. So it wasn't that long a period, um,

326
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:33.500
was because I didn't want to go into care because when you grow up in that kind

327
00:19:33.501 --> 00:19:36.290
of environment, you're brought up to kind of mistrust or authority.

328
00:19:36.291 --> 00:19:38.870
And for me care was some kind of, you know,

329
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.710
Dickensian kind of environment where I'd get girl like Oliver twist or

330
00:19:42.711 --> 00:19:46.220
something. So I didn't want to go into case. So I hid it. But you know,

331
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:47.540
I was selling the big issue,

332
00:19:47.541 --> 00:19:50.690
which is like a street magazine and people buy it for

333
00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:56.360
excellent. So I was selling this and one of my teachers, so me,

334
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:59.630
he made eye contact with me and then he looked down and he crossed the.

335
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:00.770
<v 0>Street to avoid me.</v>

336
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:07.460
<v 2>And I just cried because I knew then that actually nobody cares. I mean,</v>

337
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.870
I look back now and I think, well,

338
00:20:08.871 --> 00:20:11.180
maybe you just didn't have any change and he didn't know how to let me down

339
00:20:11.181 --> 00:20:12.680
gently. But you know,

340
00:20:12.681 --> 00:20:17.090
you think actually that's someone who is supposed to be a caregiver

341
00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:22.310
and the impact that, that had on me at that time to be honest has never left me.

342
00:20:22.311 --> 00:20:23.180
And I, I hope,

343
00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:28.250
I hope that he reflects on that and he thinks more about the

344
00:20:28.251 --> 00:20:30.740
impact that you can have on somebody else.

345
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.530
I hope you meet them and you can tell them that to his face.

346
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.000
I don't think I'd be very polite.

347
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:38.960
<v 3>Do you have any siblings? Sorry.</v>

348
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.560
<v 2>Yeah, I have one brother. Um, he,</v>

349
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:46.310
he left home not long after I did maybe a year or so later.

350
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.450
And he stayed with friends and your mom, did you get the help to do that?

351
00:20:49.451 --> 00:20:54.250
Or I actually went back and cared for her for about

352
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.360
12 years afterwards. Cause she still suffers today with her mental health,

353
00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.150
but she's seen your success and everything that happens.

354
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.510
And there's some bits,

355
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.840
some bits of the detail about how it all happened that I don't talk about

356
00:21:07.841 --> 00:21:10.420
because I've processed it, but she hasn't.

357
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.260
And so I don't want her to be affected or to become worse.

358
00:21:14.261 --> 00:21:17.560
She'll process it in her own time. I hope. Um,

359
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:21.670
but I moved away to London then and now my brother lives next door to her and he

360
00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:25.180
looks after her. So all through everything people have said, you know,

361
00:21:25.181 --> 00:21:26.920
how do you still have a relationship with her?

362
00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.700
And that's what we all have our demons and our challenges.

363
00:21:30.701 --> 00:21:33.220
And we deal with it in different ways. And yes,

364
00:21:33.221 --> 00:21:34.780
it can have an impact on other people,

365
00:21:34.781 --> 00:21:38.860
but she's still my mother and I'll never give up on her. I never.

366
00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.800
<v 0>Uh, Sabrina, you, you, uh, save money,</v>

367
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.630
um, enough to get a place to live, uh,

368
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.840
from selling the big issue. Um,

369
00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:56.790
and you were determined to become a firefighter. That was your dream.

370
00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.510
I didn't want to become a police. You didn't want to become a social worker.

371
00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:02.370
Didn't you trust them?

372
00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:07.050
<v 2>I wasn't very good with authority. I think for me, there's a,</v>

373
00:22:07.051 --> 00:22:08.340
there's a really practical thing here.

374
00:22:08.341 --> 00:22:11.940
I think social workers are incredible and I didn't realize how good mine was

375
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:16.380
until at least 15 years after I last saw him with the police,

376
00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.320
my experience with the police at the time.

377
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:22.770
Wasn't so great because you imagine you're sleeping in the doorway of a shot

378
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.440
because you have nowhere else to go and they're just doing their job.

379
00:22:25.441 --> 00:22:30.030
I get that, but they'd move you along. And I think, well,

380
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:32.280
where am I going to go, mate? You know, seriously,

381
00:22:32.281 --> 00:22:33.930
where can you move me along to,

382
00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:36.450
I'm going to wait for you to go around the corner and I'm going to go back and

383
00:22:36.451 --> 00:22:39.930
I'm going to find another doorway to sleep in this. Isn't helping the problem.

384
00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.040
So I didn't have that great relationship with authority.

385
00:22:44.041 --> 00:22:47.580
So I have an amazing relationship with police now. I think they're fantastic.

386
00:22:47.581 --> 00:22:51.330
And they do an incredible job. The problem here was the fact that they were,

387
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:56.130
they had to enforce a law that was quite frankly a little bit silly. Um,

388
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:57.023
so.

389
00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.970
<v 0>But, but, uh, and I mean,</v>

390
00:22:59.971 --> 00:23:04.440
you applied for a lot of jobs to become a firefighter and, uh,

391
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:07.030
finally you got the chance, um,

392
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:12.330
and the rest is history. So to say, um, but was it, I mean,

393
00:23:12.331 --> 00:23:16.500
there are so few female firefighters, uh,

394
00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:21.420
here in England and even in Scandinavia. Yeah. Um, did you,

395
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:26.430
did you always feel, were you always seen as an asset, uh,

396
00:23:26.431 --> 00:23:27.580
among the other 500?

397
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:32.160
<v 2>So I think that it's, it differs at different stages. So I all in all,</v>

398
00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:36.570
I've had an incredible career and I've worked with some amazing, amazing people.

399
00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:38.730
The early part of my career,

400
00:23:38.731 --> 00:23:41.880
wasn't so positive when I first joined the fire service,

401
00:23:41.881 --> 00:23:46.250
there were seven women and 1700 men. So I was very much in a minority.

402
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:51.740
Um, and I wasn't exactly welcomed with open arms for the first six months.

403
00:23:51.741 --> 00:23:55.100
I wasn't allowed my own name. They called me something incredibly derogatory,

404
00:23:55.101 --> 00:23:58.880
which I won't repeat. Um, you can Google it. It's really bad.

405
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:04.790
Um, and I had some really difficult times there and I,

406
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:05.840
I can honestly say,

407
00:24:05.841 --> 00:24:08.120
and I thought long and hard about whether to speak about this,

408
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:11.630
but I've experienced sexual harassment in my time.

409
00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:16.490
I have had unsolicited, very inappropriate pictures sent directly to my phone,

410
00:24:16.491 --> 00:24:20.000
but in this guy's defense, it was a very small screen back in those days. Um,

411
00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.830
being told that things have to be different for me because I'm a woman. Um,

412
00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.200
so there have been some really challenging times,

413
00:24:27.201 --> 00:24:29.120
but I'm going to caveat that by saying,

414
00:24:29.121 --> 00:24:33.800
I've also worked with people who are still to this day. Like my big brothers,

415
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:38.720
I've worked with people who believed in me so strongly that I've been able to

416
00:24:38.721 --> 00:24:42.800
do things that I never thought I was capable of doing and just had an incredible

417
00:24:42.801 --> 00:24:45.740
career. So it's a very small part of my experience,

418
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:50.990
but it's important I think to talk about it because I didn't at the time because

419
00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:54.920
I was young and I was insecure and I was afraid that the balance of power was

420
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:58.190
against me. And I think regardless of whatever industry you're in,

421
00:24:58.191 --> 00:25:01.310
whether it's a professional perspective or a personal perspective,

422
00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:06.080
we've all been in situations where the power relationships are such that we

423
00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:10.760
haven't been able to express how we feel or say no to something or ask somebody

424
00:25:10.761 --> 00:25:14.150
to stop what they're doing for, for fear of whatever. Um,

425
00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:16.250
and I think it's important to open that discussion.

426
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:20.080
<v 0>So your, um, you have adultery yourself.</v>

427
00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:26.890
Yeah. So will she become a firefighter as well?

428
00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.320
<v 2>I don't know. She at the moment she wants a dragon.</v>

429
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:32.770
And so there's an interesting story here, so,

430
00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.030
well, this is it. So, um,

431
00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.640
game of Thrones has a very special place in our household.

432
00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.840
So it's actually replaced cursing because I was, we have dogs, I love dogs.

433
00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:47.980
And one day I was walking around and fell over the dog and I went,

434
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:51.580
Oh mother. And then I saw her walk in this cute little face.

435
00:25:51.581 --> 00:25:54.040
I went mother dragons.

436
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:58.150
So now I'll be driving along in London and someone will cut in front of me and

437
00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.300
there'll be this little voice from inside of me going dragons.

438
00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.170
So at the moment I think she wants to, she wants to dragon.

439
00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:09.160
<v 0>So I take it. We are getting, I take it.</v>

440
00:26:09.161 --> 00:26:13.930
We are getting closer to selfie time. Thank you so much,

441
00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.130
Sabrina. Nice. Thank you very much.
