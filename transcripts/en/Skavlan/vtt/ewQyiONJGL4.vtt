00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.380
Won't commit Springsteen for a Spiller Lang it can pull me down for a

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.720
stocking. Your first artist is.

6
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.940
<v 0>Being hailed all over the country is one.</v>

<v 0>A warm welcome</v>

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.470
to Bruce Springsteen.

<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

12
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.850
<v 2>Good. Thank you. It is my birthday.</v>

13
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.540
<v 1>[Inaudible] do you, do you have a birthday routine?</v>

14
00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:43.040
Do you have something that you always do when you.

15
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.270
<v 2>Yeah, I do actually, uh, we live close to the beach,</v>

16
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.100
so I'll usually go to the beach. I take a swim and I have,

17
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.280
we have a big family in the area where we live.

18
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.720
We've got about 50 or 60 people, so we all meet down the beach.

19
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.020
We have a little Tiki bar, we set up the drinks,

20
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.840
we get the music playing and we have a little beach party,

21
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.000
usually around September 23rd is it's perfect.

22
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.560
You know, it's perfect. So, uh,

23
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.640
we kind of do we do that mostly pretty much every, every year. That's that's my,

24
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.700
you know, cheeseburgers, hot dogs is fun.

25
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.910
<v 1>You're you're here with your memoirs now. So</v>

26
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.900
it's not like a four hour concert this time. It's.

27
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.213
<v 2>Very funny.</v>

28
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.360
<v 1>And reading it.</v>

29
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.030
It strikes me that the past is very much present in your

30
00:02:41.031 --> 00:02:45.380
life and everybody's life. Yeah. But you have such a fantastic man.

31
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.290
<v 2>That's why I wrote it now, before I forgot.</v>

32
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.560
<v 1>[Inaudible] um, and you started,</v>

33
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.200
you started out quite early with music and you,

34
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.850
you were very determined, determined from a young age. Uh,

35
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.070
and actually I understand that you wanted to be,

36
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.060
uh, you wanted to replace Jagger in the rolling stones. You have this dream.

37
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.250
<v 2>I had a dream about it a couple of times. Yeah.</v>

38
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.920
That's what I used to work in front of my mirror.

39
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.630
I used to try to get all Jagger's moves and I put the stones records on and I

40
00:03:27.631 --> 00:03:31.410
lip sync to the stones records. And so I had a fantasy that he would,

41
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.760
he'd be in Asbury one night and I don't know, he'd come down with the,

42
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.080
with the cold. He couldn't make the show and they needed somebody really badly.

43
00:03:40.081 --> 00:03:45.060
And it was a very pimple faced boy in the front row. And we need that.

44
00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:50.040
She had now, you know, so, and the audience went wild.

45
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.620
<v 1>I had that dream too. Except it was you</v>

46
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.100
come up really? You wouldn't want that. I promise you, uh,

47
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.890
tell me, um, was it,

48
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.030
was there a moment in your career when you realized

49
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.110
that working with a band you had to be in charge?

50
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.230
<v 2>Well, I had a lot of experience before I signed a record contract.</v>

51
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.720
I was, I'd gotten around a lot.

52
00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:25.590
I'd driven across the country and back with the band several times.

53
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.290
Uh, we drew thousands of people to our live shows with no record.

54
00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:33.600
I was probably 19, 20 years old.

55
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.100
So I had a lot of experience with small unit democracy.

56
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.890
And I found out didn't work out that it didn't work that well, small unit,

57
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.060
it's very difficult, very difficult to make work in a,

58
00:04:48.061 --> 00:04:52.050
in rock and roll framework. So, uh, when I signed my record deal,

59
00:04:52.051 --> 00:04:56.100
I knew that I wanted to be a solo act,

60
00:04:56.101 --> 00:04:59.850
but I also missed the band cause I played in bands my whole life. So,

61
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.890
uh, I had my guys from the neighborhood. So I signed my contract. I said, well,

62
00:05:04.891 --> 00:05:09.450
I want to kind of call the shots, but I need my, my,

63
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.260
my, my men around me and my men and women, you know? So, uh,

64
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.250
um, that was kind of how it played out.

65
00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:21.540
I put the band together pretty early after I signed my record deals and I was a

66
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.180
lead because a lot of people don't realize those things till it's too late,

67
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.490
until you're much later on in your career. And, and you know, you see,

68
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.460
I mean the rock and roll bins is very strange business.

69
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.470
Imagine that you are in high school and,

70
00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:40.140
you know, three other people, four other people.

71
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.990
And then you work with those people for the entire rest of your life.

72
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.910
Those four people from high school, wherever you go and whatever you do,

73
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.490
you work with them for the entire rest of your life.

74
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.030
There's no other business where that happens except the music.

75
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.650
So you better be very close friends.

76
00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.310
<v 1>Yeah. How, how, how have they dealt with this lack of democracy through,</v>

77
00:06:06.311 --> 00:06:08.830
through the years? Pretty well, everybody

78
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.970
[inaudible].

79
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.670
<v 2>Yeah, they they've done very well. So that smoothed out a lot of the bumps,</v>

80
00:06:18.671 --> 00:06:20.260
you know? Uh,

81
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.640
but there's still a lot of give and take and there's a lot of opinions gathered

82
00:06:24.641 --> 00:06:29.230
and, and, uh, it's, it's, it's still very much a collective.

83
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.040
<v 1>I want to go back. I want to go back to your childhood. Uh,</v>

84
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.670
you write a lot about it and it's it's you, you, you,

85
00:06:36.671 --> 00:06:40.180
you described two holes, really. You grew up in two homes,

86
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.070
it's your parents' home and your grandparents are just near each other.

87
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.060
<v 2>Yeah, that was very difficult to, we had an unusual set up as a child.</v>

88
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.820
I lived in a house with my grandparents and my parents from my first,

89
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:57.820
first six years of my life. There was the nuns convent, the church,

90
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.800
the priest directory, the Catholic school, my aunt and my cousin,

91
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.770
my aunt and my uncle and my cousins,

92
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.840
my grandmother up the street and across the street,

93
00:07:10.841 --> 00:07:14.110
my Italian aunt and my Irish uncle.

94
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.190
And this was all within the space of these chairs, right?

95
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.580
So it was a very close knit neighborhood. And,

96
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.740
uh, I grew up through most of my young life in that setting

97
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:34.540
raised by primarily the Irish people we ever Irish

98
00:07:34.541 --> 00:07:39.100
Italian, uh, then around six or seven, my mother took me to,

99
00:07:39.101 --> 00:07:43.510
there was a half house that we lived in with my parents.

100
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.220
It was very difficult because I,

101
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.780
I really grown up in my grandparents home and they'd done a lot of parenting.

102
00:07:49.781 --> 00:07:53.530
And it was, you sort of get, I got really pulled apart at that young age,

103
00:07:53.531 --> 00:07:54.364
you know, but.

104
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.500
<v 1>They, they, they did the loss of parenting you said,</v>

105
00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.930
but it was really a loss of freedom for, it was too much. Yeah.

106
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.940
<v 2>Understand when I was five or six, I was staying up till 3:00 AM, you know,</v>

107
00:08:06.941 --> 00:08:10.570
and when I'd get up at three in the afternoon, and, uh,

108
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.630
that explains why, the minute I got out of school,

109
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.550
I found a job where I sleep till three and a half and I stay up till

110
00:08:18.551 --> 00:08:21.520
3:00 AM. Couldn't have been a coincidence.

111
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:27.650
<v 1>But how do you think seriously, that that affected your personality? That,</v>

112
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:27.940
that.

113
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.840
<v 2>It made me a little crazy, you know, made me a little crazy. Um,</v>

114
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.790
that's too much freedom for a child, you know? So, uh,

115
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.120
but then you go in search of it for the rest of your life. You know,

116
00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:44.500
you go in search of sort of this very boundaryless existence, and there's no,

117
00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:45.790
there's no,

118
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:50.770
there's no greater business where the boundaries are very

119
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.530
fuzzy and hazy than the music business. You, you.

120
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.280
<v 1>Had a nickname, uh, which wasn't Blinky.</v>

121
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:02.010
<v 2>That was bad, man. Well, I got, I was very nervous child. I was very,</v>

122
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:05.910
very nervous. And when I was very anxious when I was young,

123
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:10.710
because I knew things weren't operating correctly at home.

124
00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:13.740
So I used to chew my knuckles into stones and,

125
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.160
and I've had a thing where I blinked, you know,

126
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.990
who knows hundreds of times a minute, you know, it was just, it was,

127
00:09:21.991 --> 00:09:24.360
I was a very neurotic kid, very nervous.

128
00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.830
<v 1>And this was because at home, in your parents' house,</v>

129
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.830
it was like an atmosphere of.

130
00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.810
<v 2>Some of it's genetic. You know, we,</v>

131
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:38.000
we kind of had a very neurotic and anxious family that got passed

132
00:09:38.001 --> 00:09:39.860
down, particularly on the Irish side.

133
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.390
So some of it was just there and the rest of it was just some of the tensions of

134
00:09:44.391 --> 00:09:48.080
the household and, uh, uh, you know,

135
00:09:48.081 --> 00:09:51.830
you're young and you're small and it's, you don't know how.

136
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.540
<v 1>Well, what was it? I mean, we were talking about your dad here. What,</v>

137
00:09:56.541 --> 00:10:01.430
what was it? Was he passive aggressive or, or was it also outbursts?

138
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.320
<v 2>It was very difficult. My father was very ill. So, um, it,</v>

139
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.780
which showed up quite a bit later in life, but,

140
00:10:08.781 --> 00:10:12.770
but it was there when he was young, but now no one really recognized, you know?

141
00:10:12.771 --> 00:10:13.850
So it was,

142
00:10:13.851 --> 00:10:18.560
it was the day where no one had any psychiatric knowledge or no one

143
00:10:18.561 --> 00:10:22.790
understood, uh, uh, manic depressive illness or anything like that. So,

144
00:10:22.791 --> 00:10:24.830
so everybody just was a child,

145
00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:28.760
he assumed was normal and whatever there's a problem you assume is your fault.

146
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.570
And you simply try to make it better, which you can't,

147
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:37.100
and it turns you into a nervous wreck, you know, but, uh, uh,

148
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:40.850
my dad was a good guy, but he, he struggled with a very serious illness.

149
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.190
<v 1>He was diagnosed later, later in life. Yeah.</v>

150
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:49.250
Paranoid schizophrenia. Yeah. Yeah. Um,

151
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:53.300
I, I wonder, did you,

152
00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:58.370
as a child try to try to please him, or did you go up against him?

153
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:04.070
<v 2>Well, as a child, you try to please, you know, you, you, you, I mean,</v>

154
00:11:04.071 --> 00:11:07.460
your parents are gods in your home. You, what do you have?

155
00:11:07.461 --> 00:11:11.990
All you have is your little set of rooms and, and, you know,

156
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.430
they're everything. So you, you, you try to play then of course,

157
00:11:16.431 --> 00:11:20.120
once you get to be a teenager, it's a little bit different, you know, you,

158
00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:25.070
you start butting heads. And, uh, so we had a long period of,

159
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:29.600
uh, uh, where we were separated quite a bit. And we were,

160
00:11:29.601 --> 00:11:33.470
we bumped heads very hard when I was a teenager. And, uh,

161
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.920
but it was a time of tremendous generational upheaval. Also,

162
00:11:36.921 --> 00:11:39.860
this was 1966 and 67,

163
00:11:39.861 --> 00:11:43.520
where things were going on that generation.

164
00:11:43.521 --> 00:11:48.200
My parents were how old were they? I was, I was 16. They were 35.

165
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.430
I'm still very young, but the generation gap was enormous at that time.

166
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:56.760
So could not, they couldn't understand what I was going through and, and,

167
00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.490
and truth vice versa. I didn't understand their lives very well either.

168
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:01.773
You know, you don't,

169
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:06.190
you're still too young to really recognize your parents as human beings. And,

170
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:10.570
uh, uh, you know, so it's, it makes for a very,

171
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.340
very rough household.

172
00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:17.400
<v 1>Did you ever, when you go to his dog, he knows later, did you ever talk,</v>

173
00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.010
talk about it? Was it, was it something you can talk about?

174
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:24.260
<v 2>No. Uh, my,</v>

175
00:12:24.261 --> 00:12:28.230
my father was very, not a talkative person,

176
00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:33.090
which he was throughout his entire life that never changed. Uh,

177
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.440
and so we had to communicate, in other words, I communicated through my music.

178
00:12:37.441 --> 00:12:42.120
I wrote a lot of songs about my dad, you know, and I also believe that I,

179
00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:47.730
I modeled myself on my father and my father was a blue collar working

180
00:12:47.731 --> 00:12:51.990
class guy. He was kinda, he was kind of beefy and big. And,

181
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:55.410
and I think when I, when I went to work,

182
00:12:55.411 --> 00:13:00.390
I kind of put his clothes on and I chose to write about

183
00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:04.230
that, that, that part of my life and that part of our lives together.

184
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:09.330
And it was a way of trying to communicate with them was also a way of trying to

185
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:14.700
honor him was a way of trying to probably seek out his love.

186
00:13:14.701 --> 00:13:19.470
I'm sure. And so this was how we communicated. And my only,

187
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:23.670
uh, I, I never heard anything. I'd take the records to the house.

188
00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:28.890
Never heard anything, bring them over, play, never heard anything.

189
00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:32.880
Then at the very end of his life, I said, Hey dad, you know,

190
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.830
what's your favorite songs? You know, he goes, Oh, the ones about me.

191
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.073
<v 1>That's true.</v>

192
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:47.873
[inaudible].

193
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.730
<v 2>Music. Music was, I had a feeling.</v>

194
00:13:50.731 --> 00:13:53.070
It was in the Italian side of my family.

195
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:58.170
They all played the piano a little bit and sang. Um, but I was like,

196
00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:02.700
everybody else, I, I saw Elvis on television and, and it,

197
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.610
it just rattled me.

198
00:14:05.611 --> 00:14:10.440
And then the Beatles came in 64 when I was 14, which was the perfect age.

199
00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:13.770
You were ripe for the picking, you know, you were,

200
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.670
didn't quite know who you were looking for, something to identify with,

201
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:19.590
looking for something you could do.

202
00:14:19.591 --> 00:14:22.470
So you could stand yourself when you look in the mirror.

203
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.430
And all of a sudden there it was, there's four guys.

204
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.700
There's a bunch of women. They're screaming at them.

205
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:36.000
<v 1>Well, how do I learn to do that job? So</v>

206
00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:44.160
do you see yourself, do you see yourself as,

207
00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:48.240
as a songwriter first and foremost, or a guitarist or a senior, or.

208
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.800
<v 2>That was, I was young. I was, you know,</v>

209
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.580
the fastest guitar in town. You know, I started out as a guitarist.

210
00:14:55.581 --> 00:15:00.050
And so that was, I was a gunslinger and, uh, uh,

211
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.950
did that for a long time, built a big rep as a guitar player.

212
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.560
And then I started to sing a little bit,

213
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:11.480
and then I built a big rep as a front man, but I, when I looked around,

214
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.160
I was very, very good,

215
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.590
but I could see guys that could play guitar as well or better.

216
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:19.670
See guys had sang as well or better. So I said,

217
00:15:19.671 --> 00:15:23.090
I really concentrated on my writing because your writing,

218
00:15:23.091 --> 00:15:26.720
you have a chance to develop a very singular voice,

219
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:31.280
a voice that's your own comes out of your roots, comes out of the town.

220
00:15:31.281 --> 00:15:34.760
You came from, comes out of the people that, that you came from.

221
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.530
And that was my, that was my goal. You know, I wanted to tell my story,

222
00:15:39.531 --> 00:15:42.350
my parents' story, my town's story.

223
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:45.890
And ultimately I wanted to tell your story.

224
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:50.660
So I really concentrated on developing an original voice through my writing.

225
00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.230
<v 1>And part of that,</v>

226
00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:57.700
I didn't part of this project is it's kind of

227
00:15:57.701 --> 00:16:00.220
describing if I understand you, right?

228
00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:04.990
The landscape between the American dream and the American reality what's

229
00:16:04.991 --> 00:16:05.824
happening there.

230
00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:08.740
<v 2>I took that on as sort of my,</v>

231
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:15.880
my job as I got older, I just naturally wrote that kind of music.

232
00:16:15.881 --> 00:16:20.230
First of all, you know, I mean, you know,

233
00:16:20.231 --> 00:16:22.960
in America, you're taught

234
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.970
anybody can go there. You know, anybody can you've got it.

235
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.960
But at the same time, I bumped into the rat with my parents.

236
00:16:31.961 --> 00:16:35.050
I saw them struggle very, very, very,

237
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:39.250
very difficultly for the tiniest little slice of what people call the American

238
00:16:39.251 --> 00:16:43.990
dream. So I said, okay, this is, it's a lot harder than it looks, you know?

239
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.490
And I just took that as something that I wanted to write about, you know,

240
00:16:48.491 --> 00:16:49.660
it was also a way of,

241
00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.250
of criticizing the place I came from while,

242
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:59.650
while still feeling a sense of pride, you know? So I said, well,

243
00:16:59.651 --> 00:17:03.760
I'm going to try and measure that distance between what's re what's reality.

244
00:17:03.761 --> 00:17:07.510
What's the dream cause that's what the country is struggling towards every day.

245
00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.450
Uh, and the better we're doing that, the better as a people we are,

246
00:17:13.451 --> 00:17:15.100
but it, it's very difficult.

247
00:17:15.101 --> 00:17:18.970
And it's a lot of baby steps is as anyone in,

248
00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:23.260
in government knows, you know, it's uh, and, uh,

249
00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.510
but it, it was,

250
00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.350
it made for a satisfying and rich writing stuff.

251
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:30.220
<v 1>Checked,</v>

252
00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:35.080
but looking at America today and what's happening this fall

253
00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:39.940
with the election. Yes. Uh, the current were from Europe.

254
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:41.890
It's very hard to understand what's happening.

255
00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.520
So how would you explain that for,

256
00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.180
for Sweden and the region people? I mean, it's, it's very.

257
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:55.190
<v 2>How would I explain it speaking to a Swedish or Norwegian person?</v>

258
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:07.910
<v 1>[Inaudible] I don't, I can't find in any of your songs, I can,</v>

259
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.270
I can find a lot of characters, but I can't find Donald Trump.

260
00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:17.000
<v 2>That would be, you'd have to search out the Carnie Barker, you know, the, uh,</v>

261
00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:23.030
the fraud, but, uh, it's, uh, uh, it's very difficult.

262
00:18:23.031 --> 00:18:24.170
I think, you know, there are certain,

263
00:18:24.171 --> 00:18:26.480
we have certain problems in the United States because of the tremendous

264
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:30.890
inequality of the wealth distribution that makes for ripe,

265
00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:35.870
ripe ground for demagoguery. And he comes along and he has a very simple,

266
00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:40.190
a simple answer to all these very, very complex problems, uh,

267
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.090
and is telling people some of the people, the things that they want to hear,

268
00:18:44.091 --> 00:18:46.880
if you're very uncomfortable by the Browning of America,

269
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:48.980
while we're going to build a wall and keep all those people out,

270
00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:50.750
if you're frightened from T Ravel,

271
00:18:50.751 --> 00:18:53.480
we're just going to keep all those people out. Uh,

272
00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.660
if you're worried about your job, we're going to bring all your jobs back,

273
00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.010
you know, so this is basically his campaign saying it,

274
00:19:01.011 --> 00:19:02.900
like I'm saying it here, you know, so,

275
00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:08.270
but if you've struggled and if you've suffered and you haven't gotten that piece

276
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:13.160
of the pie, or you're just struggling to keep your family going,

277
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:18.720
it can be someone saying is a very, very compelling argument. It can be. And,

278
00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:24.430
and, you know, there's, it's very difficult to deal with the complexities of,

279
00:19:24.431 --> 00:19:27.800
of, of governance. And, and, uh,

280
00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:30.920
if someone tell you to wait or be patient it's, so there's,

281
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.110
it's just a rich environment for,

282
00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:37.470
for unfortunately for a demagogue. And, uh,

283
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.570
while he's, it's almost too high,

284
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:47.450
too high of a title to place it, it's, it's, it's, the absurdity is, is, is,

285
00:19:47.451 --> 00:19:51.020
is beyond cartoon. Like, you know, but, um,

286
00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.470
he's gotten close enough, so it can make you nervous. You know,

287
00:19:54.471 --> 00:19:56.810
I don't think he's gonna win, but, uh,

288
00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.550
even him running is a great embarrassment for you're an American.

289
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.510
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

290
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:11.000
<v 2>I have done my best, best to avoid that happening.</v>

291
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:16.250
<v 1>We were talking about control, um,</v>

292
00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:21.800
and you're in control and you are, you are,

293
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:25.310
I know you're not happy with the word, but you are the boss. Uh

294
00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:38.150
[inaudible] but, uh, in, in your, in your memoirs,

295
00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:43.220
uh, there is one episode where you lose control and that's,

296
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:44.630
that's in Gothenburg.

297
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.090
What was happening there? We didn't know.

298
00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:52.800
<v 2>I, I don't remember. I think I remembered in the book.</v>

299
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:55.350
All I remember was smashing a guitar with him.

300
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.990
<v 1>And that's not you. I mean, that's not your style. Is it.</v>

301
00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:03.180
<v 2>Within inches of Jon Landau? My manager's head, unfortunately. And,</v>

302
00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:04.230
uh,

303
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:09.210
I think I was young and I was just starting to play these very large venues.

304
00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:13.800
And I felt an enormous amount of stress to not lose my

305
00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.050
contact with my audience.

306
00:21:16.051 --> 00:21:20.880
And I was used to a certain sort of intimacy with my audience,

307
00:21:20.881 --> 00:21:24.180
and I was unsure if I could bring that along and present that.

308
00:21:24.181 --> 00:21:26.280
And in venues of that sort.

309
00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:30.480
<v 1>Swedish press had printed a picture of your hotel bed.</v>

310
00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.320
That was something well done.

311
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:38.070
<v 2>The tabloid news in Sweden is very intense, you know,</v>

312
00:21:38.071 --> 00:21:42.990
and which I found out when I was married and we went through Stockholm and,

313
00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:47.790
and we were pursued quite intensely. And, uh,

314
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:48.720
then when we left,

315
00:21:48.721 --> 00:21:52.230
there was simply a picture of our hotel bed in the newspapers.

316
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:56.910
So I did wonder if this is going to go on for the rest of my life.

317
00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:00.540
And of course, people get bored quickly and move on. So it didn't.

318
00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:02.580
<v 1>Maybe sleep deprivation as well.</v>

319
00:22:02.581 --> 00:22:07.500
Since we talked about the Arianna Huffington was here to sleep. Yeah.

320
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.000
Do you have ever had that sleep deprivation?

321
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:14.610
<v 2>I sleep pretty well, but I dream really wildly, you know,</v>

322
00:22:14.611 --> 00:22:19.470
my dreams are like a house party or going on. I mean, there's, it's just,

323
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:22.050
I dream every night, very intensely.

324
00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:26.820
I sleep for about eight or nine hours. I like to sleep. Perfect. But.

325
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.310
<v 1>So do you write down your dreams?</v>

326
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.120
<v 2>I used to, but I stopped doing it, you know, I mean,</v>

327
00:22:33.121 --> 00:22:36.630
I used to write them down and I go in and I'd tell a guy and he'd tell me what I

328
00:22:36.631 --> 00:22:41.040
was thinking. And he was, he was right very often, but, uh,

329
00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.700
uh, I should probably write them down again. I've gotten out of the habit, but,

330
00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:47.850
uh, they're very cool.

331
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:52.740
<v 1>You, you, you also write very,</v>

332
00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:57.330
you're very open about, about not only your father's problems,

333
00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:59.040
but your own problems, your own.

334
00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.010
<v 2>Ran, ran in the family. So.</v>

335
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.630
<v 1>Maybe it's more like, it's more like a depression you write about isn't it.</v>

336
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:12.150
<v 2>Family members who really suffered through it. You know, I don't know,</v>

337
00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.760
half a dozen probably, you know,

338
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:18.800
just on the Irish side have had a lot of different mental issues.

339
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:22.080
It was just something that was in our blood, you know?

340
00:23:22.081 --> 00:23:24.970
So the piece of it got ahold of me and,

341
00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:29.670
and I've had to deal with it throughout my life a little bit, but, uh, uh,

342
00:23:29.671 --> 00:23:34.080
you know, it was a lot of psychopharmacology. It really helps out a lot. Uh,

343
00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:39.060
and, uh, you know, I did the talk therapy and that's actually, that's,

344
00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:41.100
I've done it for a long, long time, 30 years or so.

345
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.350
<v 1>38 Years with the therapist.</v>

346
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:47.980
[inaudible].

347
00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:48.910
<v 2>What did I learn.</v>

348
00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:52.840
<v 0>With the same type of therapist.</v>

349
00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.240
<v 2>Or, Oh, I had one guy that died on me already.</v>

350
00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:02.440
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

351
00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.830
<v 2>He literally went through his death trying to figure me out, you know,</v>

352
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.360
then I went through another guy. So.

353
00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:11.740
<v 1>Tell me about that first time being Bruce Springsteen, very famous person,</v>

354
00:24:11.741 --> 00:24:16.570
because you were a 30 years ago and you go into that office.

355
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:17.583
I mean, it's.

356
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:22.750
<v 2>You know, well, their job is to see, see through all that, you know, of course.</v>

357
00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:26.230
And, uh, I mean, I didn't ask the guy if he was a fan, you know,

358
00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:31.670
I just want, wanted to cry, you know, there was no, there wasn't any,

359
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:36.460
there wasn't any talk about my records or anything. So, uh,

360
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:42.160
um, uh, when, once you get there where you you're going there,

361
00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:44.710
those things don't matter in much.

362
00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:49.540
<v 1>This is something that comes and goes in your life as it does. Um,</v>

363
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.890
is it, is it possible to describe how it feels? I mean,

364
00:24:53.891 --> 00:24:55.150
how that darkness is?

365
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.600
<v 2>Well, it's just, everything goes blank, you know, it's like, you're,</v>

366
00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:00.580
you're just done. It's, it's, it's, uh,

367
00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:05.410
you can't get out of bed and everything is,

368
00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:08.020
is, it's a very distinct,

369
00:25:08.021 --> 00:25:12.280
you have a very distorted picture of your life and those around you, you know?

370
00:25:12.281 --> 00:25:16.900
So, uh, um, and it sapped a lot of your energy,

371
00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.140
amazingly, not when I played her, when I recorded, for some reason,

372
00:25:20.141 --> 00:25:22.780
those things remained on touch, you know, but, uh,

373
00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.210
for your family life and for your home life,

374
00:25:25.211 --> 00:25:29.200
it takes a lot of your energy and confuses things quite a bit. But, um,

375
00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:31.270
you know, you,

376
00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:35.200
you work your way through it and we figure it out as best as you can.

377
00:25:35.201 --> 00:25:38.380
And I was lucky, you know, Patty was, you know, my wife was very,

378
00:25:38.381 --> 00:25:43.000
very helpful and, uh, she's been very patient. Yeah, very, she was very,

379
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.500
just always great with spotting it when it was, you know, you're not doing well,

380
00:25:47.501 --> 00:25:50.650
you know, you think about, you know, think about what's going on.

381
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:53.740
So she was very helpful, very, very helpful.

382
00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:57.850
<v 0>Churchill suffered from depression. And he called, it said.</v>

383
00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.010
<v 2>The black dog, the black dog.</v>

384
00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.430
<v 0>The need by black dog or something, it would.</v>

385
00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.240
<v 2>The black dog. Yeah, it's true. That was a good policy. Good name for it.</v>

386
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:10.990
<v 0>Good. Thank God for, for good medicine.</v>

387
00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.400
<v 2>Thank God for drugs. That's really</v>

388
00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:19.683
[inaudible].

389
00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:25.810
<v 1>I must ask you, when you, you, you, you came to Scandinavia this summer and you,</v>

390
00:26:25.811 --> 00:26:29.500
you, uh, gave several concerts and, uh,

391
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:32.710
you're famous also for, uh,

392
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:35.980
for these concerts going on so long.

393
00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:40.600
And now this is your birthday. You you're 67 years old.

394
00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:47.440
<v 0>Let's [inaudible].</v>

395
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:50.730
<v 1>They need to become, the concerts will need to become shorter.</v>

396
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:55.170
That's a good point, you know, uh, I mean, uh,

397
00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:00.750
it's nice for yourself. That's what I'm saying. I don't know.

398
00:27:00.751 --> 00:27:04.770
You know, they've actually gotten longer as I've gotten older, so, uh, yeah.

399
00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.110
Well, why do you do that? And I said, I have no idea.

400
00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.670
<v 2>Yeah. It's a little out of my control. I, I, I don't watch the clock.</v>

401
00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:16.520
Um, I go out there until something happens and if it feels good,

402
00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:19.580
then you want to stay, you know, and we've had,

403
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:23.570
we have incredible audiences in Sweden and in Norway, I mean, we have just,

404
00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:27.620
this is their home away from home there, you know? So it's, it's,

405
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:32.330
you always want to be at your very best when you're, when you're there. So, um,

406
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:34.040
you know,

407
00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:38.390
it shows in Gothenburg this summer were just spectacular and,

408
00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:43.220
but it's a deep home feeling when I, when I go there now, you know,

409
00:27:43.221 --> 00:27:48.110
I really feel, uh, it's, it's, it's my place, you know?

410
00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:52.730
So, uh, but why didn't I play some I, I'm not sure. You know,

411
00:27:52.731 --> 00:27:53.564
I mean, I've,

412
00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:58.130
I've spent a lot of time asking the doctors about that.

413
00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:03.230
<v 1>Well, nobody's complaining here. Just be sad,</v>

414
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.850
but I, I, I'm thinking you, you, we want you to last long, you know,

415
00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:14.120
I'll let you know when I'm in trouble and I have one last question.

416
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:16.400
Did you ever get to play with the stones?

417
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:19.670
<v 2>I did. I did. Yeah.</v>

418
00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:25.460
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

419
00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:28.430
<v 2>And it was, uh, it was better than my dream. It was, it was, uh,</v>

420
00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:34.010
it was in a little rehearsal studio. It was just the, you know,

421
00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.350
just the guys in the band and myself, and,

422
00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:41.000
and it just threw me completely back to being in a garage with my guys in the

423
00:28:41.001 --> 00:28:45.020
early days. And it was, it was pretty wonderful. It was pretty wonderful.

424
00:28:45.021 --> 00:28:46.880
So thank you. Thank you.

425
00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:01.820
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>
