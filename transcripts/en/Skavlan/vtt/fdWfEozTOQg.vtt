WEBVTT

1
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:04.880
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.960
<v 1>Yeah, I can see, but I think that I totally agree with you on, on,</v>

3
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.860
especially on where you have lower, very low income and large difference.

4
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.720
Some of the African countries totally agree that, uh, you can't, uh,

5
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.140
house, uh, the Fort is controlled on the few hands.

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.260
Obviously it should be distributed. Uh,

7
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.920
well then we on the region fund is distributed to everybody area,

8
00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:31.550
all are part of it. Uh, but, but the sad thing is it's a,

9
00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:35.930
it will never grow up in forever. It is obviously because the oil will be, uh,

10
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.760
uh, there is, uh, or, or it will be gone, but, uh, but, uh, then again, it,

11
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.360
I think the vital point, or this is, um, uh,

12
00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:48.580
what's critical and I don't argue the, at all, uh, you know,

13
00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:52.820
the history because that's very well addressed as very well addressed. Um,

14
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.430
and, uh, it's time that somebody that does it,

15
00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.440
but what I think you would want should emphasize is what

16
00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:04.490
system create jobs because creating jobs, great welfare.

17
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.450
If everybody, if certain, uh,

18
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.250
it might be, you should actually accept that people that work very hard are,

19
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.290
have a payback on working hard, that you should accept.

20
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.810
It's a very wrong if you, if you, uh, do it like you did in, uh,

21
00:01:23.811 --> 00:01:28.100
in China, [inaudible].

22
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.320
<v 0>I don't think this is the main risk in Europe today. No, China.</v>

23
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.660
<v 1>Just taking, uh, the example, that's an extreme example.</v>

24
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.890
So I, I totally agree with it, but that's, that's,

25
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.690
that's the way you should never do it. You should,

26
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.940
there is all this basic for this.

27
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.460
You should always have a system that you

28
00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:55.820
get return of the job you do. If you've worked very hard,

29
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.930
you should have a return of it. If you, if people doesn't have a return on it,

30
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.980
they will not work very hard. And it gets people to start working.

31
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.620
It will motivate and motivates people.

32
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.270
<v 0>I think the solution is two policies. I'm just curious. Well,</v>

33
00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:14.480
I think you need to find some, some balance, you know, again, Windsor,

34
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.920
very I income and wealth group sometimes are able to do a fiscal

35
00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:22.850
optimization so that they pay less than the middle class. You know,

36
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:24.290
I think this is too little. And you know,

37
00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:29.240
when Warren Buffett with the top U S billionaires will be Gates says that he

38
00:02:29.241 --> 00:02:33.260
pays less tax than his secretary. Yeah. I think this is a problem.

39
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:37.370
So global tax, well, you know, let's start with, uh, you know,

40
00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:38.240
European countries.

41
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:42.170
I think if you take European countries and the corporate tax in Europe,

42
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.360
you know, I think that if we don't coordinate, uh, we will end up with, uh,

43
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.530
you know, 0% corporate tax, just like in a written stacks now it's okay.

44
00:02:51.531 --> 00:02:53.300
You know, I would like every tax to be zero,

45
00:02:53.301 --> 00:02:56.260
except that we have to pay for schools and our social models.

46
00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.460
So then we have to overpack someone and, you know, overtaxing, labor,

47
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.900
captive, labor income, and consumption the way we do. I, you know,

48
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:06.550
I don't think that's good for job creation.

49
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:11.440
So you need some level of inequality to motivate a manager. That's for sure.

50
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.041
Now,

51
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:16.990
is it useful for the economy to pay top managers

52
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:21.880
in the financial sector or other big companies, 10 million euros per year,

53
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:26.500
instead of 1 million? You know, I couldn't find it in the data. You know,

54
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:29.500
I couldn't find in the data, the extra performance,

55
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.290
the extra drug creation that you would expect.

56
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:34.060
So of course you need to pay managers well,

57
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.920
but the idea that if you just pay them 500,000 euros and nobody will

58
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:41.590
accept to work because it not works working out for that,

59
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.830
and you need to pay 10 million, but you know,

60
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:48.190
the inequality we are talking about today, you know, it's, it's a, you know,

61
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:50.320
you have very large groups. Uh,

62
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.150
if you take in the U S which is the most extreme case you have about

63
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:59.380
70% of total us economy grows between 1980 and

64
00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:04.240
2015, which has gone through the very top income groups. Now,

65
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.650
given that the growth of wealth, this period was not so good. You know,

66
00:04:07.651 --> 00:04:10.490
1.5% per year in per capita,

67
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.850
if you have 70% of that going to the top,

68
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.980
everybody now in the U S agrees that this has contributed to the stagnation

69
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.260
of Midian. Uh, I was all income. You know what the bottom 50% is getting.

70
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.663
And in the end,

71
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.670
this also contributed to the rise of household debt and this contributed to,

72
00:04:28.671 --> 00:04:32.800
to fragilize the economy system. So it's okay to have, you know, rich people,

73
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.300
middle people, poor people,

74
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:38.680
but you need everybody to grow more or less at the same speed in the long run.

75
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.390
<v 1>I totally agree with you. But on the other hand, yeah, I totally agree.</v>

76
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.670
And take as an example, I'm not, I'm thinking I'm even not even among the 10th,

77
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.530
highest paid in Norwegian. A lot of pilots are pay more, earn more than I paid.

78
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.870
That's the paycheck, right? That's the paycheck.

79
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.550
But if you're starting out the shares, the shares, okay. But then again,

80
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.270
I paid 10 times as much tax as I earn.

81
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.640
Correct. Is it.

82
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.710
<v 0>Pay 10 times as much tax? So you pay a 90% tax rate.</v>

83
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.640
<v 1>No, I paid, I paid 1000% tax rate.</v>

84
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.240
So what I have to do, I have to sell off things. So of course,

85
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.850
out of the things that you create, is it the right?

86
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.490
<v 0>So what's your tax rate as a fraction of your wealth? Well, tell us,</v>

87
00:05:26.491 --> 00:05:27.600
what's your waste? What's your tax.

88
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.730
<v 1>It's now.</v>

89
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.130
<v 0>So what's your wealth.</v>

90
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.670
How much is your wealth and how much is your tax each year? That we can.

91
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.600
<v 1>10 Times that what I have in totally trouble.</v>

92
00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.450
<v 0>But you're not answering my question. So what, how much is your wealth,</v>

93
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.040
your networks today?

94
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.160
<v 1>And my net worth depends on the shares on the.</v>

95
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.200
<v 0>Value of the case with the market value of today.</v>

96
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.880
<v 1>Although then I know I'm on a,</v>

97
00:05:52.881 --> 00:05:55.920
the shares are going down to the strikes on the way I'm on the wrong side.

98
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.370
[inaudible] New phone number, but it's negative four for this year.

99
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:06.860
It's been negative because I bought, I still pay attention.

100
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.700
<v 0>Your network is negative.</v>

101
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.040
<v 1>And no, but the value has gone down.</v>

102
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.430
<v 0>I understand it has been done, but what is this value now?</v>

103
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.820
<v 1>Uh, then I have to multiply with the share. Uh, I actually say it another way.</v>

104
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.860
I don't care about what, uh, what I.

105
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.360
<v 2>Oh, it was</v>

106
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:30.303
terrible.

107
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.630
<v 0>I'm just trying to get a sense of what's your wealth, what's your tax,</v>

108
00:06:37.631 --> 00:06:40.120
so that we can all have a sense of what's going on. You know,

109
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.860
I don't know what John said, but.

110
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.570
<v 1>Tell me, how can we do all this, the market [inaudible] it's in the stock,</v>

111
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.280
uh, on the stock exchange is the, it's a, it's a company on the stock.

112
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.680
It's the value on the stock? [inaudible] ballpark figure.

113
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.850
It would be 1 billion, two billions on your work.

114
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.450
<v 0>Okay. So let's say when billion to make a simple number, now, what's your tax.</v>

115
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.553
What was your.

116
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.700
<v 1>Interesting times as much as, uh, aside, uh, can you give us a number?</v>

117
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.050
<v 2>No. If, if this is amazing, you know,</v>

118
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.593
I just say.

119
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.340
<v 1>I, I don't, I don't even, uh, I'm not even in the range of it, uh,</v>

120
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:26.440
say I'm, I'm, I'm a couple of hundred thousand dollars, but then I,

121
00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.290
you pay a $2 million in tax, right.

122
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.630
<v 0>Okay. But 2 million out of 1 billion normally commute.</v>

123
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:39.370
So this is an average tax rate on your, you know, I don't know, I'm just,

124
00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.670
I don't want to, you know, to overdo it, but you know,

125
00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:47.620
when we're in perfect with a billionaire in the U S when we're in

126
00:07:47.621 --> 00:07:52.090
perfect did the same computation and he did it, right. He did it until the end.

127
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.480
We computed these Wells, which was more than 1 billion, you know,

128
00:07:55.481 --> 00:08:00.310
it's like $50 billion and he computed total tax

129
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.750
and is compare, you know, the tax rate and compared with the secretary,

130
00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:06.970
you know, this was less, but, you know, I don't know in your case,

131
00:08:06.971 --> 00:08:11.680
but I think it's important to put these numbers into the public

132
00:08:11.681 --> 00:08:16.030
domain and public scrutiny so that we can all make an opinion. And, you know,

133
00:08:16.031 --> 00:08:18.580
I'm not saying, I don't know.

134
00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:22.240
I think we need transparency about this, you know, so that we can,

135
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:23.320
we can have an opinion.

136
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.580
<v 1>And I think everybody should pay tax, but I think it's,</v>

137
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.610
if you give away whatever you are and that's, that's a, it should be.

138
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.190
<v 0>I'm not saying that, you know, but.</v>

139
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.380
<v 2>Who decides what you are to earn is.</v>

140
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.890
<v 1>You to you, you decide that yourself. I, I.</v>

141
00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:40.670
<v 2>I mean, that's, I.</v>

142
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:45.490
<v 1>Don't think he is correct. And I totally agree with it's. Uh, this is, uh,</v>

143
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:49.570
the woman, a CEO, shouldn't earn a lot more than the rest of the day.

144
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:53.380
It should be on the same level as, as, as the top manager. If we.

145
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.850
<v 0>If we take the words of in the world today,</v>

146
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.210
according to what magazines are doing, and, you know,

147
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:01.670
you have different magazine, Asia,

148
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.000
Forbes magazine at the world level for world billionaire or different magazines

149
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:08.040
in different countries, no, in Sweden, in France.

150
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.920
And they all find more or less the same thing,

151
00:09:10.921 --> 00:09:15.870
which is that if you look over the past 20 to 30 years and you take your fixed

152
00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:18.930
fraction of the world, population has the top. And you look at our average,

153
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.550
well, since this group has been rising,

154
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.140
so people above when the underlying wealth on average is,

155
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:29.100
has been rising at six, 7% per year in real time. So you have,

156
00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:31.410
some people will go down. Some people will go up,

157
00:09:31.411 --> 00:09:34.050
you have some mobilities and renewal of these group, of course,

158
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.280
but taking into account those who go down, those who go on average, the average.

159
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.400
Well, so the group is going up at six, 7% per year. In real terms,

160
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.280
in the top of inflation. Now this is perfectly fine,

161
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:48.240
except that average wealth in the world and average income is going up at one to

162
00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:51.780
2% per year. So in terms of tax rate,

163
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:56.520
you can see that if you have a wealth tax rate of 1% or

164
00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.710
0.5% or 1.5%, and if you grow at six, 7% per year,

165
00:10:01.711 --> 00:10:05.700
on average, that's not going to make Metro for different.

166
00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:09.240
So I know this can seem like a big tax to you when you make the check.

167
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.860
But when you look at the overall equilibrium for the entire society,

168
00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:17.850
you still have increasing concentration in the top 12 groups,

169
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.800
which at some point we'd have to stop.

170
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.210
<v 2>But don't you, don't it? Sorry, I can't answer that. No, I,</v>

171
00:10:23.211 --> 00:10:25.760
I agree with you shouldn't make the different speaker.

172
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.830
You should think about job creation, how to create Trump, because it

173
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:36.110
doesn't have a point there that you focus very much on the inequality and the

174
00:10:36.111 --> 00:10:40.000
inequality as a problem, but isn't, isn't the most important thing to, to, to,

175
00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.140
to actually lift poor people out of poverty.

176
00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.830
And of course the problem in your book,

177
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:50.000
I see the problem that's being, we have these super rich people getting richer,

178
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.860
but it's, is that really the problem? No.

179
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.760
<v 0>You know, I care a lot more about the pros and about the region in my book,</v>

180
00:10:55.790 --> 00:11:00.620
I try to compare different societies over time by looking at

181
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:04.490
our bottom Alfin society. So I look at different groups.

182
00:11:04.491 --> 00:11:07.910
I look at the bottom 50%, the top 10%.

183
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:09.860
And in that the top one or two,

184
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:14.390
and then the middle 40% who are not in the bottom RF and not in the top 10 and

185
00:11:14.391 --> 00:11:18.080
which I call the middle-class patrimonial middle-class in my book.

186
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.260
And what I really care about is the share,

187
00:11:21.261 --> 00:11:25.430
going to the bottom 50 in the middle 40, more than the, than the top in itself.

188
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.560
Now, the problem in practice is that if you want to finance the

189
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.200
investment in education in infrastructure,

190
00:11:33.201 --> 00:11:38.030
which is really what can help you to reduce inequality and to get the button to

191
00:11:38.031 --> 00:11:40.820
move up, you also need tax revenue,

192
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:45.780
and you also need an equitable tax system because our social contract in,

193
00:11:45.781 --> 00:11:50.270
in Europe and in many parts of the world relies on the view that, okay, we,

194
00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:54.640
we pay a lot of tax to pay for public and education and earns,

195
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:58.870
but we all pay a lot of tax. And if we have groups at the top,

196
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:04.270
we're able to negotiate a 0% tax rate on what they get, because,

197
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.860
uh, basically there's competition between countries to attract them. I think,

198
00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:13.810
in the long run, this can, Danja our social consensus.

199
00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:18.820
And there's a risk that many people in the middle or in the bottom feel,

200
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:21.310
okay, well, you know, if the top people are not paying, you know,

201
00:12:21.311 --> 00:12:25.150
I don't want to pay and they will go for selfish solution. You know,

202
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:29.860
when you don't manage to solve your domestic inequality problem in a peaceful

203
00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:33.760
manner, you can always find other people to blame. You can find foreign workers,

204
00:12:33.761 --> 00:12:35.920
you can from foreign countries. And, you know,

205
00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:40.870
I'm very concerned about the rise of nationalism and populous movement can,

206
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:43.260
which, which, which can be a consequence of this.

207
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:47.870
<v 2>And can, can this just information how much the, the, the, the,</v>

208
00:12:47.871 --> 00:12:51.360
the top 1% is worth it, can that also be fuel friendly.

209
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.880
<v 0>Can also be fuel.</v>

210
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.710
<v 2>For envy. I mean, because it creates,</v>

211
00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.310
I mean like your book maybe can, for some.

212
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:04.560
<v 0>I don't think people are motivated by envy. You know, I think the problem again,</v>

213
00:13:04.561 --> 00:13:09.240
is when you have all this news report saying that multinational

214
00:13:09.241 --> 00:13:12.330
companies are not paying any corporate tax anywhere in Europe.

215
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.650
And if you have a small and medium sized company and you're paying 30%,

216
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.730
40% tax, and you ears at large mature of being one or two,

217
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.570
that it's not a point of envy, it's just a problem of, of basic fairness.

218
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:28.440
<v 2>Don't you think we need values here, values from leaders that say, Hey,</v>

219
00:13:28.441 --> 00:13:32.160
you know, if we have this huge multinational company, why should we pay 0%?

220
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.130
We come down to the values and,

221
00:13:34.131 --> 00:13:38.480
and making a difference in the business world where businesses, as,

222
00:13:38.481 --> 00:13:40.800
as leaders can be responsible and say, you know,

223
00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.840
let's be equitable or let's give back, or, you know,

224
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.500
Norway has got this huge fund. What can we do to get rid of it?

225
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.190
Not necessarily get rid of the whole thing, but, you know, do something where

226
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.830
she has. He got the point here that, that it's, it's, it's very different,

227
00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.970
how people are rich. I mean, you have, you have, uh, you have people that,

228
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.080
that use their wealth to buy Ferrari's or,

229
00:14:03.081 --> 00:14:08.070
or fancy yachts, you know, and you have people that, that choose to,

230
00:14:08.071 --> 00:14:11.490
to, to start charities or give them their money away.

231
00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.780
It's totally different way of being well. No, you're right.

232
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.670
<v 0>I had this fascinating discussion with bill Gates a couple of weeks ago,</v>

233
00:14:17.671 --> 00:14:20.520
and he wanted to write a review on my book. So he told me, okay,

234
00:14:20.521 --> 00:14:24.390
we need to have a CLU Skype conversation before I write my review. So I say,

235
00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:27.270
okay, let's do that. And he said, okay, I love your book.

236
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:30.570
Inequality is a big problem, but I don't want to pay more tax, basically.

237
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.580
<v 2>That's precisely I don't care. Right?</v>

238
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.900
<v 0>No, he came with actually a solution, which is close to what you said here,</v>

239
00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:41.250
which is he say, okay,

240
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.940
I'm ready to pay 90% tax on very high consumption.

241
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.660
So if you consume a lot, then you should pay a lot of tax.

242
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.000
But if you just give your money away, should not. Now the problem is, you know,

243
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:55.700
what's consumption, you know, in the U S for instance,

244
00:14:55.701 --> 00:14:58.940
you have all these billionaires, we are giving this money to political

245
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:02.990
action committee, to political parties. So, you know,

246
00:15:02.991 --> 00:15:05.510
when the curse browsers was, is rapidly, very, you know,

247
00:15:05.511 --> 00:15:09.050
very Republican billionaires were founding the tea party, you know,

248
00:15:09.051 --> 00:15:11.960
when they are giving money to this, you know, it's this consumption, you know?

249
00:15:11.961 --> 00:15:13.490
So when, when you're very wealthy,

250
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.750
you cannot just consume very much on food or clothes. You know,

251
00:15:17.751 --> 00:15:22.430
you very often you consume, uh, influence or power. So you consume, uh,

252
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:26.840
some time practitioners or journalists academics. And, and so, you know,

253
00:15:26.841 --> 00:15:31.760
the progressive tax on consumption ID, I think as limits. And, and also,

254
00:15:31.761 --> 00:15:35.210
it's not easy to see what's personal consumption. You take your corporate jet,

255
00:15:35.211 --> 00:15:35.840
you know, this,

256
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.110
this personal consumption is this investment from your company account.

257
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:44.090
So I think Netwealth is a much better indicator of your ability to

258
00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:48.230
contribute to the common. Good. And then if you want also to give to charities,

259
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.940
if that comes on top of taxation, then that's perfectly fine, but you cannot,

260
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.110
it's very difficult to organize society by letting people decide

261
00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:01.340
themselves how much they want to contribute for the common. Good.

262
00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:06.850
<v 2>Well, one final question since your book came out, uh, it's been, uh,</v>

263
00:16:06.851 --> 00:16:09.700
it's been debated a lot on, um, on the, um,

264
00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:14.110
discussed a lot and even criticized by, by, uh,

265
00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.350
quite many, uh, um, I wonder,

266
00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:21.670
has that changed your views because it's based on, this is an ongoing research.

267
00:16:21.671 --> 00:16:24.670
I mean, it's not, it's not conclusive, uh, has that,

268
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.100
that has these discussions changed your views?

269
00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:27.400
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

270
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:31.900
it probably is to me the most positive impact of the success of the book and the

271
00:16:31.901 --> 00:16:35.020
publication in the book. And now more than 42, a long way,

272
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:40.030
Jesus is that it induced in many governments in several countries to

273
00:16:40.031 --> 00:16:44.980
open their fiscal data and their fiscal archives in a way that

274
00:16:44.981 --> 00:16:47.890
they did not open before. So if I was to rewrite the book today,

275
00:16:47.891 --> 00:16:52.840
I could include a new countries in the book, like in Korea, in Taiwan,

276
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.360
in Brazil, in Mexico. Uh,

277
00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.780
they did not to open the data before and after the publication of the book,

278
00:16:58.781 --> 00:17:02.800
many journalists, like you asking the government in Brazil, okay,

279
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:06.790
why are y'all not in the book? And, and now they are opening their data sources.

280
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:09.460
So this is an ongoing process, as you said, you know,

281
00:17:09.461 --> 00:17:14.110
the data we have collected in the book is imperfect. You know,

282
00:17:14.111 --> 00:17:17.740
it is much more than what we had before, but it is still too little.

283
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.370
And so this will continue and we have a website, uh,

284
00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.260
the world wealth and income database,

285
00:17:23.261 --> 00:17:26.980
where we will keep online as much data as we can.

286
00:17:26.981 --> 00:17:31.240
And then people can draw a different conclusion. Let me say very clearly,

287
00:17:31.241 --> 00:17:34.150
we are in the area of social sciences. And, you know,

288
00:17:34.151 --> 00:17:39.070
I don't pretend that the conclusion I drew from my historical findings

289
00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.570
as the only possible conclusion.

290
00:17:40.571 --> 00:17:44.560
So I have no problem with disagreement and discussion. And, you know,

291
00:17:44.561 --> 00:17:47.680
this is why in the end, I'm interested in these issues about money.

292
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:49.560
Everybody has a strong, and.

293
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:51.323
<v 2>That's why has that been,</v>

294
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.820
has that been irritating sometimes for you that the left side of politics has

295
00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.880
hugged you so much? They, they, they totally love you.

296
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:04.400
<v 0>Uh, well, you know, there are some people on the right who like me as well,</v>

297
00:18:04.401 --> 00:18:08.410
you know, look, this is not a book for,

298
00:18:08.411 --> 00:18:10.520
for the left or book for the right. You know,

299
00:18:10.521 --> 00:18:13.100
this is a book for people read books and, you know,

300
00:18:13.101 --> 00:18:16.940
for people who don't read books, there's nothing I can do. But, uh, uh, it's,

301
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:19.270
uh, uh, you know, I think if you open the books,

302
00:18:19.271 --> 00:18:21.140
you will see first that it's very readable. You know,

303
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.810
this can be read absolutely by anyone. It's a bit long.

304
00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:26.120
I am sorry about these very heavy, very

305
00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.510
history of income and wealth, uh,

306
00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:34.070
since 18th century in over 30 countries. So this is a long story,

307
00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:39.050
but this is readable and then people can make their own mind about the future.

308
00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.680
And, uh, you know, I, uh, again, I have no problem with disagreement.

309
00:18:42.681 --> 00:18:45.860
I'm not member of any political party and, and, uh, you know,

310
00:18:45.861 --> 00:18:47.180
anybody can rule conclusion.

311
00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:51.560
