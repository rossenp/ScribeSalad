00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.320
<v 0>Please welcome to the show.</v>

2
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.250
[inaudible]. Thank you. Thank you. Um, first of all,

3
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.120
when you were a young poet in New York city,

4
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.460
did you ever get a reception like this?

5
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.390
<v 1>Uh, well, I got a lot of, uh, go back to the kitchen where you belong.</v>

6
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.420
Uh, I got,

7
00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:46.040
sometimes I got a great reception and sometimes I got a lot of booze and I just,

8
00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:50.060
I, I just did my thing. I just plowed through it, you know,

9
00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:52.100
whether people like me or not, I just didn't.

10
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.110
I just went ahead and did what I was doing.

11
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.010
<v 0>[Inaudible] how did you find the strength for that?</v>

12
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.330
<v 1>I just it's what you do, you know? I mean, I never, uh, you know,</v>

13
00:01:08.331 --> 00:01:11.180
I've always been, uh, I guess as a scrappy kid,

14
00:01:11.181 --> 00:01:14.150
I was the oldest of three children. Um,

15
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.160
I always had a lot of responsibility, um, and I just, it was,

16
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.300
if I'm on stage,

17
00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:25.280
it's my responsibility to reign them in and I'll do it, you know,

18
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.750
I'll fight till the very end. I don't think I've ever failed. Um,

19
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.430
I had a lot of Rocky moments.

20
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.743
<v 0>But.</v>

21
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.300
<v 1>You have the strength because that's what you're,</v>

22
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.560
that's what you'd like to do by doing something you like, and you believe in,

23
00:01:39.561 --> 00:01:41.450
it gives you internal strength.

24
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.410
<v 0>Do you, would you call yourself a perfectionist? No.</v>

25
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.440
<v 1>No, because, uh, I never, well,</v>

26
00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:55.040
when I'm writing, when I'm doing a drawing,

27
00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:57.170
when I'm writing a poem,

28
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.470
I have a expectation of perfection,

29
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.150
but when I'm performing singing or, you know, with people,

30
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.300
I don't care about any of that for me,

31
00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:12.110
the most important thing is communication. And, uh,

32
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.270
I'll all communicate at the expense of, you know, to get a laugh.

33
00:02:17.271 --> 00:02:18.890
I don't mind if I look foolish,

34
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.490
I don't mind if I fail a little or make a mistake,

35
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.870
as long as I feel that, uh, the people in Ireland, you know,

36
00:02:26.871 --> 00:02:29.960
staying in tune with each other. And so, uh.

37
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.670
<v 0>Th th this, this is so interesting to talk about because we were in, uh,</v>

38
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.350
we ha uh, you, you were in Stockholm. Oh yeah. You were there,

39
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.100
you were there to honor Bob Dylan. Uh,

40
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.910
I mean the Nobel Laureate. Yes. Um,

41
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.860
how was that experience for you?

42
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.620
<v 1>That experience was one of the most difficult experiences of my performing life.</v>

43
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.910
And for anyone who didn't see, uh, I was, um, in,

44
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.240
at the Nobel ceremony to sing a hard rain's gonna fall,

45
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:08.710
which is seven minutes long, uh, to honor Bob Dylan, the, uh,

46
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.920
poet Laureate or the, the literary Lord.

47
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.060
And I knew the song backwards and forwards.

48
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:19.330
I've been singing it since I was a teenager. Um, I,

49
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:22.450
and I was singing with the orchestra. I was ready.

50
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.490
I felt confident. And I don't know what happened the second,

51
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:31.570
first I froze not forgot the words. I mean,

52
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.960
I froze. I, I, I,

53
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.130
it was when I think of it now, I still can do what I did.

54
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:43.630
I covered my face. I was so humiliated and ashamed,

55
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.060
uh, to fail. Um, what went through your head? What did you, I.

56
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.220
<v 0>It was a big decision to ask, to ask to begin again.</v>

57
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.820
<v 1>There's cameras. I knew it was being filmed globally.</v>

58
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:02.070
I just had to tell the truth. That's one thing I've learned as a performer.

59
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.290
If you tell the people the truth, um, they'll, they're very forgiving.

60
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.180
And I just told them I got nervous, which I never get nervous,

61
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.260
but I was so nervous. And I just asked the,

62
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.870
if we could start over and, um,

63
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.270
I could feel everyone with me, the King, the queen,

64
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.210
the Lords, they're like, come on, you couldn't do it. And you could,

65
00:04:27.211 --> 00:04:31.410
I could feel it. And then, you know, it got through it. And, um,

66
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.720
I learned a great lesson though, from that, which was, was the next day.

67
00:04:36.721 --> 00:04:40.410
I mean, for myself, I felt, of course, unfulfilled.

68
00:04:40.411 --> 00:04:44.880
I felt terrible that I didn't just do my

69
00:04:44.881 --> 00:04:48.990
best for Bob Dylan for the people. And the next day,

70
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.410
all the Nobel laureates, all of the people,

71
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.480
they were so happy and so happy to see me and so happy that I was

72
00:04:57.481 --> 00:05:02.340
so flawed and had such a rough moment because they told me they all

73
00:05:02.341 --> 00:05:03.174
do.

74
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.770
And they felt a kinship and they felt well,

75
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.330
well, if she goes through that, you know, we all go through it. And we all,

76
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.600
they took selfies. I had selfies with all the notebooks.

77
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:20.813
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

78
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.740
<v 1>No, no, I, I didn't. Bob is a very private man. Um,</v>

79
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.530
I spoke to his son, his oldest son,

80
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.470
who said the family was very happy with me.

81
00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.510
And he said that his father said that, uh, no one, uh,

82
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.510
messes up his lyrics any worse than he does.

83
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:41.753
<v 0>That's comforting.</v>

84
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.790
[inaudible] what do you think is the biggest misconception about you?

85
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.380
<v 1>I, I, well, I, um,</v>

86
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.760
sometimes I think I have a very, uh,

87
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.430
I suppose because of my youth or the idea of people's idea of what

88
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:06.860
punk rock is or something, um,

89
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.780
they imagine that I'm devoid of humor that I'm going to be really

90
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:15.680
mean, or I'm going to come like, come on a show like this and start, you know,

91
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:20.510
kicking things over and yelling at everybody and cursing and everything.

92
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.750
And, uh, you know, I, they, you know,

93
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.920
if people have preconceptions of what I might be like,

94
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.150
but I'm just like, you know, I mean, I have, you know,

95
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.440
if I'm on stage and I feel a certain energy, I'll,

96
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.580
I'll put my foot through my amplifier or rip off my guitar strings.

97
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.650
But when I'm in a family situation, I'm respectful to the family situation.

98
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.420
Um, kid friendly.

99
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.980
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

100
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.190
<v 2>W when you became a part of the rock scene, uh,</v>

101
00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.820
you came from poetry becoming a part of the rock scene,

102
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.860
and you had a great success. Did, did the business tried to change it?

103
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.590
<v 1>Well, they want me to either comb my hair for one thing,</v>

104
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.350
I was happy being rough.

105
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.820
<v 2>You had a great radio hit with Bruce Springsteen cost the night.</v>

106
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.290
How was that for you suddenly having that?

107
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.230
<v 1>Well, I was happy about that. Um,</v>

108
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.230
when I listened to the music that I wrote words on,

109
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.720
when I listened to Bruce's production,

110
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.550
I knew that it was going to be a very popular song. And in a way,

111
00:07:33.551 --> 00:07:38.260
I didn't want to do it because I was hoping if I ever had a popular

112
00:07:38.261 --> 00:07:43.000
song that I would write it myself, but it was the perfect song for me.

113
00:07:43.001 --> 00:07:47.800
The key was perfect. The rhythm was perfect. It was very anthemic.

114
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.083
And, um,

115
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:54.550
and I was really in love with my boyfriend and I was able easily to write

116
00:07:54.551 --> 00:07:59.080
words to it. I knew that some people would say,

117
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.040
Oh, you sold out or, um, you know,

118
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:08.170
say things like that, or you've become mainstream, but I didn't care. I mean,

119
00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:13.000
I'm always the same person. I'm always the same person I evolve,

120
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.150
but I don't change, uh,

121
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.400
for any material reason.

122
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.620
And I was very happy to have a song that communicated with

123
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:28.480
people on such a large scale. If I could I'd write the hit of the world,

124
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.430
I would love to write a song because everybody's saying.

125
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:35.763
<v 0>Um.</v>

126
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.800
<v 2>You mentioned your boyfriend, uh, he was later to become your husband.</v>

127
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:47.020
How did the two of you meet? That was, it was a like flubbed first time was it?

128
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.500
<v 1>We, uh, we met in Detroit.</v>

129
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.020
It was my first time playing in Detroit,

130
00:08:53.021 --> 00:08:56.340
on my horses tour in 19 six.

131
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.110
And I really don't like parties and they wanted to throw a party for me at

132
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:04.440
night, and I don't really like them. So they said, okay,

133
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.950
what if we have a bunch of people at a hot dog place,

134
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:10.170
and you can just get hot dogs and, uh,

135
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:14.790
in Detroit and meet some local musicians. So I said, Oh, okay.

136
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.500
So I go to the hot dog place, the Lafayette Coney Island got a hot dog,

137
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:23.820
and I was very happy. I liked it. You know, got my hot dog. Then I said, okay,

138
00:09:23.821 --> 00:09:27.510
time for me to go. And I was just about to go.

139
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:31.710
I almost made it out of there when I saw this guy

140
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.900
standing again right next to a white radiator in a blue

141
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:41.610
coat. And he looked at me and I looked at him and I thought,

142
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.650
that's the guy I'm going to marry.

143
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:49.160
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

144
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.690
<v 1>I can't explain it. It's actually one of those out chemical things. But,</v>

145
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.420
and he was, I mean, it took a few years, but.

146
00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:00.200
<v 0>So it was like, that was the first thing you said to him.</v>

147
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:04.670
<v 1>No, I said it to me. I said, no, I didn't tell him that. No,</v>

148
00:10:04.671 --> 00:10:08.720
I said it to myself. I just saw him. And that was it. Uh,

149
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.420
did you start talking then? Um, well,

150
00:10:11.421 --> 00:10:16.280
I was on my way out and I was introduced to him and I think it was Lenny

151
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.080
Kay. Who said, um, Fred Smith, Patty Smith,

152
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.250
Patty Smith, Fred Smith. And that's how we met.

153
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.360
<v 0>[Inaudible]. You've said that you've said that motherhood, um,</v>

154
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.640
actually strengthened your work, uh, gave you a discipline.

155
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.103
What do you mean by that?

156
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:47.690
<v 1>Well, I've, I mean, I always worked, um, uh,</v>

157
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.130
when I was younger, but I,

158
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:54.050
I was fairly undisciplined and I was also interested in so many things

159
00:10:54.051 --> 00:10:58.400
and drawing and painting and writing and performing.

160
00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:03.440
And then when I married, um, and had my first child,

161
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.210
I, life greatly changed and, um, you know,

162
00:11:08.211 --> 00:11:12.140
is no longer my work and myself, we're the center of the universe.

163
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.000
The child becomes the center.

164
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:19.100
And so what I did is I chose one thing

165
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:23.540
writing, which I could do economically simply.

166
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:27.080
And in solitude disappeared from the Roxy. Oh yes.

167
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:31.670
Fred Knight decided to leave public life and just,

168
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:36.680
um, and just get to know each other and, and raise a family.

169
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:41.210
And so I, I chose the hours of five in the morning,

170
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.100
till eight in the morning when,

171
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:47.870
when my child and my husband were sleeping and I would wake up

172
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:53.270
and I taught myself to use those three hours to write and study.

173
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.340
And in 16 years I did that religiously.

174
00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.500
And in that period,

175
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.190
even though I didn't publish or do anything in the public eye,

176
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.210
I grew as a writer. Um, I, uh,

177
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.170
became more disciplined as a, as a human being. And, um,

178
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:15.850
and I learned a lot about myself and I learned a lot about my mother.

179
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:21.250
I realized, you know, I was always disinterested in domestic things.

180
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.860
I was never, I always wanted to be an artist.

181
00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:27.940
And then I realized how hard she had worked.

182
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.550
She had four children and she was a waitress.

183
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.650
And I had issue first one child than two.

184
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.070
And, um, and no nine to five job.

185
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.400
And I still saw how much, um,

186
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:46.960
sacrifice and labor goes into taking care of one's family.

187
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.400
So it was really, uh, I learned a lot about the people,

188
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:56.530
which I didn't count myself as one, you know, artists, um,

189
00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.240
you know, at least when I, when I grew up,

190
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:05.410
it was sort of like a different kind of sacrifice and elite

191
00:13:05.411 --> 00:13:09.670
sacrifice. We sacrificed ourself for our work and that's what we did.

192
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:14.800
But, um, I had to shift, you know, that point of view.

193
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.210
<v 2>But now that your children are grownups, do you still,</v>

194
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:22.080
do you still wake up at five and you still start to work?

195
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:26.160
<v 1>Well, maybe more close to six 30 or seven, but I still,</v>

196
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:31.020
I still write in the morning. I still it's. Uh, yes.

197
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:35.070
Well almost every morning guests. It's the first thing I think about.

198
00:13:35.071 --> 00:13:39.600
I wake up and sometimes a dream I have, or thoughts, waking thoughts.

199
00:13:39.601 --> 00:13:44.130
I want to write them down. And I think of two things when I wake up, well,

200
00:13:44.131 --> 00:13:48.840
three, I have to feed the cat, but I'm coffee and writing.

201
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.640
And so that's, those are the two things that come to mind. I,

202
00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:57.180
the other thing I wanted to say in having children is yes. Um,

203
00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.450
it is possible to be, uh, empathetic,

204
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.680
whether you have children or not, but then when you have children,

205
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.570
there's another level of it. It's not, it's, there's human empathy.

206
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.680
And then there's parental empathy. So if you, if, uh,

207
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:17.250
you imagine if someone loses their child,

208
00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:21.900
if you project that onto your own situation, your own child,

209
00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.300
it becomes even more unbearable.

210
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:29.850
<v 2>I asked you if you could bring a guitar. Yeah. And you brought your guitar,</v>

211
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:33.660
uh, I don't know what you're gonna play. Uh, you haven't told anyone here,

212
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.320
so we don't know. Um, but I'm,

213
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.270
I'm thinking of one song. I'm certain,

214
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:43.260
it's not that one because that's not for one guitar, but, but the song Gloria,

215
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:47.340
it's, it's a song that opens with lines. Jesus died for somebody sins,

216
00:14:47.341 --> 00:14:51.650
but not mine. Have you often had to that?

217
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.550
Yes.

218
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:56.360
<v 1>In fact, when I first, uh, when that record first came out,</v>

219
00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:01.340
I had legions of people actually praying for me or telling me,

220
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.940
you know, um, uh, I was going to be, you know,

221
00:15:04.941 --> 00:15:09.620
struck by lightning or that I didn't believe in Jesus. And I said, of course,

222
00:15:09.621 --> 00:15:12.020
I believe in Jesus. He's the first,

223
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:16.370
the first thing I evoke on my first record is his name.

224
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:17.930
And really,

225
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:22.280
it was not so much about Jesus himself as

226
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.270
the, the, the way organized religion, uh,

227
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.530
presents him to us. And also I was a young girl.

228
00:15:30.531 --> 00:15:34.550
I wanted to be take responsibility for my own actions. I don't want,

229
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.360
didn't want Jesus to have responsibility for every mistake I made.

230
00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:43.610
I wanted to make my own mistakes. But, um, um,

231
00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:48.620
in terms of his teaching, he's given us one of the greatest teachings,

232
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:52.220
love one another. There can't be any teaching,

233
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.230
more clear and beautiful than that.

234
00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.600
<v 0>Tell me, what are you going to, what are you going to sing for us?</v>

235
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:06.940
<v 1>Well, I'm not a very good guitar. I really am not. And, uh,</v>

236
00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:12.040
I often make lots of mistakes. So I thought the simplest thing is, sorry.

237
00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.800
<v 0>We're going to get some help with the sound here. Can we have that?</v>

238
00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.670
<v 1>The simplest thing is just do a song that only has one chord.</v>

239
00:16:18.671 --> 00:16:20.050
So then I can't really,

240
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:25.270
I know Tom Dooley that has to Tom Dooley stew ball has

241
00:16:25.271 --> 00:16:30.070
three. Um, I have to stand up actually, actually,

242
00:16:30.071 --> 00:16:33.100
if you don't mind, I'm going to do a little song of that.

243
00:16:33.101 --> 00:16:37.840
Lenny K and I wrote called, uh, beneath the Southern cross. And,

244
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.063
um.

245
00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:41.290
<v 0>So I'm curious. Why did you choose that one?</v>

246
00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:47.170
<v 1>Uh, recently? Uh, I lost a very good friend of mine, Sam shepherd,</v>

247
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:51.700
and of course, every one of us, uh, Sam Shepard, a beautiful writer,

248
00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.360
and I thought it would be nice, um, uh,

249
00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.700
to sing a little song for him.
