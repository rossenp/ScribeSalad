00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.310
<v 0>Alex and Marcus Louis welcome.</v>

2
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.960
[inaudible] Alex, when you were 18 years old, you have this accident,

3
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.530
a motorcycle accident. Uh, and when you woke up from that,

4
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.330
all you could remember was your brother, your twin brother Mark.

5
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.120
<v 1>Yeah, my first memory, I guess,</v>

6
00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:27.290
in my whole life was waking up and just seeing his face and just saying hello,

7
00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:31.400
Marcus to him. And at that point, I just thought everything was fine.

8
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.480
I'd been in a coma for about six weeks from a motorbike crash.

9
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.200
And so I was very disorientated. I didn't know what was happening.

10
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.350
And I saw him, I knew his name, I thought fine.

11
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.290
<v 0>Can you, can you try to describe that bond, that, that bond between you as,</v>

12
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.550
as identical twins.

13
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.110
<v 1>It's kind of a, it's a, um, a non bike-able bond. We would describe it as, um,</v>

14
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.950
as identical twins. Everybody works on a hundred percent, right?

15
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.990
We reckon the identical twins work on 110%. So we work inside that 10%.

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.833
And that's the difference?

17
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.670
<v 0>Um, the thing is that this, um,</v>

18
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.260
this gave you a,

19
00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:16.220
an enormous responsibility because you were the one that had to recreate his

20
00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:18.670
memories in a way and, and,

21
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.570
and teach him everything again. Yeah. So.

22
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.080
<v 1>He woke up, he didn't know, um, anything that was going on around him.</v>

23
00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:31.160
He didn't know who am I, who our mother was. And though she was there.

24
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.320
So my mother came to the bed. So he woke up and said, hello, Marcus, or Marcie,

25
00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:37.640
as he used to call us in the old days.

26
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.140
And then my mother came up and then he started getting very excited.

27
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.070
And he said, who is this woman? And I said,

28
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.200
but this is our mum. And he said, I don't know who she is. She needs to go away.

29
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.280
Cause she's freaking me out. But he knew exactly who I was and he knew my name.

30
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.870
So that's when I realized that he had got zero apart from one fact,

31
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:00.800
which was me.

32
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.140
<v 0>But does that mean he couldn't do normal things like that?</v>

33
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.700
<v 1>He started off, um, in a mental age of about six or seven.</v>

34
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.570
Um, so he didn't know what a hospital was. He didn't know what a bed was.

35
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.690
He'd never seen a cat in an animal house, nothing.

36
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.250
So he had to start from zero ground, zero ground, zero shoe laces,

37
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.400
brushing your teeth, simple stuff. So that start again.

38
00:02:25.401 --> 00:02:28.670
So we started that process. When he came out of the hospital,

39
00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:30.500
we started that process slowly. How.

40
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.050
<v 0>How did he go about, well.</v>

41
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.930
<v 1>You know, we're quite old now. So back in those days,</v>

42
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:39.800
there was no aftercare and the national health, it was see you later,

43
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.690
he was awake and we went home. And so we had no professional help.

44
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.560
And my mother was refusing to believe that she did, he did lost his memory.

45
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.300
So it was just me on my own. I was 18 years old. So we just,

46
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.830
he just only stuck to me. And so I just had to explain, you know,

47
00:02:57.831 --> 00:03:00.040
this is our house, this is our, this is our room.

48
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.510
This is how you brush your teeth. This is how you choose, you know,

49
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.710
that was the easy stuff.

50
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.100
And then we went through the house and then he understood what everything was

51
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:12.280
going on. And then eventually we got into more difficult stuff.

52
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:16.380
Like this is your girlfriend. Um, yeah,

53
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.520
we got past the easy stuff pretty quickly.

54
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:24.550
And then go to the more complicated stuff. Yeah.

55
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.370
<v 0>But, but, but it's because you, you take us to that house,</v>

56
00:03:29.371 --> 00:03:33.420
the house that you came back to, it didn't recognize, never, never seen before.

57
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.630
Um, what kind of hope.

58
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.370
<v 1>It was really daunting. It was enormous house.</v>

59
00:03:38.371 --> 00:03:41.970
Our parents lived in a very grand English Manor house and it's,

60
00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:45.060
I have lots of wings. It was enormous thing. And it was just very daunting.

61
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.960
It was quite, the whole thing was very scary. I was very shy.

62
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.670
I didn't really say much. I cried a lot. I was basically a kid in an adult body.

63
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.100
<v 0>And, um, your mother described, how, how was she, what kind of woman?</v>

64
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.970
<v 1>She was a, she was, she was a, an English debutante,</v>

65
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.210
high society lady. She was the center of any party.

66
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.430
Everybody knew who she was when she came in the room.

67
00:04:08.431 --> 00:04:12.660
You definitely knew she had arrived very loud. So you know,

68
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.990
an amazing presence. And she just could not,

69
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.620
or would not accept that her son did not know her.

70
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.220
<v 0>What about your stepdad? Because he was also there.</v>

71
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.470
<v 1>Yeah. My stepdad was, um, he was a difficult character. He was, um,</v>

72
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:30.151
uh, you know,

73
00:04:30.151 --> 00:04:34.710
he was quite a powerful man in his field and he was not a particularly nice man.

74
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.980
Um, he didn't really take to us very much. So he was, he was quite cool.

75
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.390
Yeah. So he, he never came to the hospital for instance. Um, so he never.

76
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.330
<v 0>There were quite strict rules that were normal to you,</v>

77
00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:55.320
but really normal. Yeah. We, um, we.

78
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.660
<v 1>We moved out to the shed when we were 14.</v>

79
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.810
We weren't allowed to live in the house. We lived in a shed in the garden,

80
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.090
a basic shed, no heating, no nothing, just lights. And we're talking about, um,

81
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.510
he didn't want you in the house and we're talking about a nine bedroom house

82
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.230
with huge grounds that we used to open to the public in the summer, you know,

83
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.910
proper grand house in England.

84
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.310
And we lived in the shed because we weren't his kids and he

85
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.590
felt he didn't want, you know, he just didn't want us in the house.

86
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.830
It was easier just to get rid of us. So, you know, we lived out there. We, we,

87
00:05:27.831 --> 00:05:29.790
we quite like living out there cause it was a lot easier.

88
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.620
<v 0>This was what you had to, to bring him back to yes.</v>

89
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.240
This life and, and so far so good, I guess. Uh,

90
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.250
but the whole truth about what had happened before he

91
00:05:44.251 --> 00:05:49.140
lost his memory that was revealed after your mother's death, right?

92
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.380
Yeah.

93
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.020
<v 1>Yes. Yeah. For me, everything was normal.</v>

94
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.560
I got the life I had from 18 to 32.

95
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.240
I lived the fantasy life that my brother gave me. I lived in that world.

96
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:03.080
I didn't know any different. My parents were fantastic people. They were lovely.

97
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:05.480
We had a lovely childhood. Everything was fairy tale.

98
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.960
Maybe he gave me a fairy tale book and I lived it from 18 to 32.

99
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.090
And when I didn't ask questions, now it was basic questions.

100
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.890
I asked basic questions, but it was normal for me.

101
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:20.690
I didn't have any reason to ask questions. So it was, it all seemed in place.

102
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.250
And I look back on it now and I just can't believe I didn't try it when dad

103
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:29.420
died. So he died when we were 25,

104
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:33.740
25, you can tell it. Yeah. He died when we were 25.

105
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.480
And he was very, very difficult man, very cruel man. And he asked,

106
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.990
he was on his death bed and he came, he came to us and he said,

107
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.680
I want you both to forgive me for the way I've treated you, your whole life,

108
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.750
I'm going to die. And I wanted to go to heaven.

109
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.060
He suddenly became religious and he wasn't religious.

110
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.340
He became religious in the last four days. And

111
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.260
will you forgive me and moccasins? And I was like, yes, of course,

112
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.400
I'll forgive you. You know, you can go in peace. And [inaudible] said, no,

113
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.413
you can die.

114
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.080
I'm not giving you forgiveness and walked out of the room two days later,

115
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.670
he's dead. And I was like,

116
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.830
that was the first time that Marcus and I had ever had it.

117
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:15.220
<v 0>Problem. But when your mother died, uh, what did you think then?</v>

118
00:07:15.221 --> 00:07:18.730
Did you think that now he will learn the truth? Now it will.

119
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.330
Everything will be revealed.

120
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.400
<v 1>No, I didn't. I just felt that, you know, now she's gone. Um,</v>

121
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.630
I can live my life in a much easier way, so I don't have to deal with her.

122
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.980
And I was never going to tell Alex ever what happened because he'd been,

123
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.120
he'd been left with this nice, happy childhood that I created for him.

124
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.680
So it gave me a sense of relief from the childhood that we had had. Um,

125
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.350
so it was a, so he was of doing himself.

126
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:49.240
He was doing me a favor by giving me his gift, but he was also gifting himself.

127
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.630
<v 0>But it was a double thing. How was it revealed to you? How did it feel?</v>

128
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.050
<v 1>So when our mother died, that was the moment I realized everything.</v>

129
00:07:56.051 --> 00:07:59.230
Wasn't right. Because how can it cost? Cause nobody cried.

130
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:05.500
No one cried about as our sisters, no one cried. I was the only one crying.

131
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:09.940
She just died. And I suddenly thought, Whoa, Whoa, hang on a sec.

132
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.890
What is happening here? And that's,

133
00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:16.210
I started thinking and it really troubled me. So I started working,

134
00:08:16.211 --> 00:08:19.570
looking at things and asking more questions. And then we started. So then we,

135
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.390
then we started cleaning out the house. Um,

136
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.820
and then we started finding strange things in the house,

137
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.730
which Alex was struggling to accept.

138
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.470
So we found lots of odd things and sex toys and some,

139
00:08:32.471 --> 00:08:36.160
some weird stuff going on and I'm starting to get more and most sort of freaked

140
00:08:36.161 --> 00:08:39.700
out by it. When our, all our birthday presents, we found in the loft,

141
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:43.630
every person that we never given to us, biological parents, grandparents,

142
00:08:43.631 --> 00:08:47.410
everything hard with mobile. You never saw the gifts, never saw the gifts,

143
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.600
stole all the money is still in the envelopes. One pound, two pounds.

144
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.760
Amazing. If you never gave them to us all still there. So we found all of that,

145
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.800
which was kind of quite strange. And that was really strange. And then,

146
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:03.150
and then we opened up this, um, the back of the cupboard,

147
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.740
there was another little small cupboard inside and we went inside there and

148
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.390
I can't remember which one of us did it,

149
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:13.920
but we basically opened this drawer and there was a photograph in there of us to

150
00:09:13.921 --> 00:09:17.790
age 10 naked with our heads cut off.

151
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.460
And now my whole world has just changed in an instant.

152
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:27.320
<v 0>So, so sorry, the heads, the heads were cut off.</v>

153
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.700
<v 1>Of the picture and now I'm thinking, Whoa,</v>

154
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:36.530
this lady is way more complicated than I have been led to believe who the hell

155
00:09:36.531 --> 00:09:39.950
is she? And what is this about? And that's when we started.

156
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.100
<v 0>Did you, did you confront your brother directly? Yeah.</v>

157
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.650
<v 1>Yeah. So after a little while I would switch,</v>

158
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:49.490
I had to get some therapy just to deal with that and then sorted that out.

159
00:09:49.491 --> 00:09:53.000
And then I chose challenge markers and I literally just challenged them with

160
00:09:53.001 --> 00:09:56.450
simple words. Where are we abused by our mother or not?

161
00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.340
<v 0>And what did you answer?</v>

162
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:03.380
<v 1>I didn't, I just nodded, he just nodded. It was just, it's a moment.</v>

163
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.130
<v 0>Because your, your world fell apart in a way also.</v>

164
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.120
<v 1>Everything, you know, you have a choice in life. You can decide to tell a lie,</v>

165
00:10:11.121 --> 00:10:14.840
which is quite a big thing to do to your brother. Um,

166
00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:18.290
or given the truth. So for me,

167
00:10:18.291 --> 00:10:22.910
I created a life for both of us. Are you angry? Really angry?

168
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.070
Yeah. Yeah. Really bad.

169
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.740
<v 0>I mean, he, he didn't want to say anymore, right?</v>

170
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.400
<v 1>Couldn't say anymore. Cause he, the game was up. He'd been caught out.</v>

171
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:36.200
The live was over. I was furious. The one person I trusted in my entire life,

172
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:40.670
the only person I trusted had lied to me and had been lying for

173
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.760
over a decade. At that moment, I was on my own.

174
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.970
And for the first time in your life, first time in my life, I was on my own.

175
00:10:46.971 --> 00:10:50.630
And I just didn't know how I didn't have any emotions or, or,

176
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.540
or know how to get to the next stage.

177
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:58.220
<v 0>But did you, did you want to know more? Did you want to find out everything?</v>

178
00:10:58.580 --> 00:10:59.510
How long did it take?

179
00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.210
<v 1>So it took me, it took me from the,</v>

180
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.660
from the age of 32 to 50.

181
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.600
So 20 years, 20 years of obsessively, trying to work out who I was.

182
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.300
<v 0>And you didn't say anything for 20 years, you wouldn't.</v>

183
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.740
<v 1>I gave him the bare bones. Um, I'd kind of like,</v>

184
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:23.420
I kind of told him that we would have been abused by a lover and that was really

185
00:11:23.421 --> 00:11:24.290
all he needed to know.

186
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.530
<v 0>How was the relationship between you? We wear those.</v>

187
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:33.320
<v 1>When we went back to a hundred percent minus fraternal soap. Yes.</v>

188
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.890
That's the thing. So we got back together. I was very angry with him,

189
00:11:36.891 --> 00:11:40.190
obviously for awhile, but within a few short, well, when we say a while,

190
00:11:40.191 --> 00:11:41.990
a few months, a few months, I mean, were twins.

191
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.690
People would take years to do that. We did that in a few months, even a story,

192
00:11:47.691 --> 00:11:48.500
as big as that.

193
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.940
<v 0>In a way you accepted that, he didn't want to talk about it. Yeah. What, what,</v>

194
00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.610
what do you know today? So I learned.

195
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.600
<v 1>A lot more that we were definitely,</v>

196
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:03.520
our mother was a serial pedophile and she used all her own children to do

197
00:12:03.521 --> 00:12:06.280
that with, um, for her own gratification.

198
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:10.660
And she then went on to handing her children out. She ran a ring,

199
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:15.040
Peter fire ring, and she used her children to supply that ring for,

200
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.500
she was a very wealthy individual. We can't think it was for money.

201
00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:21.790
We'd have no idea what the motivation of all that was, but that's what she did.

202
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.870
So we were abused by her friends, men.

203
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.850
<v 0>So this, this was, this became a part of her social life.</v>

204
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.260
<v 1>Came a part of her social life. She would deliver us to someone's house, have,</v>

205
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.680
have drinks, have a glass of wine near us there.

206
00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.880
<v 0>And you, you just know this, you remember?</v>

207
00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.320
<v 1>Yeah, for me, it's a story for him. It's real. I mean, I,</v>

208
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.170
I had no intention of really telling Alex the whole thing. Um,

209
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:52.680
and then in the documentary that we made, I had,

210
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:57.630
we'd been doing that shooting for 10 days and we'd got to know the director for

211
00:12:57.631 --> 00:13:00.870
five years before, before we started shooting,

212
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:06.000
he spent five years getting us on the side. Then when he was doing the shooting,

213
00:13:06.001 --> 00:13:08.610
he kept asking me, so what really happened? What really happened?

214
00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:13.020
And he's a very good director. And he just kept asking me and I kept saying,

215
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.570
well, why do you want to know? And then something snapped to me.

216
00:13:15.571 --> 00:13:17.550
And I just said like, I'm going to tell you.

217
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:23.100
So I told him straight to camera and he asked me the next

218
00:13:23.101 --> 00:13:25.950
day, whether I could do it again for Alex. And I said, I couldn't do that.

219
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.100
<v 0>Okay. W when did you realize that that's not normal?</v>

220
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.280
<v 1>I was 14 years old. I was in, uh, in London in a,</v>

221
00:13:32.281 --> 00:13:35.280
in a strange guy's house. Uh, he was, uh,

222
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:40.500
quite a famous artist and I was in his four poster bed and he

223
00:13:40.501 --> 00:13:43.170
started talking. It was just you, not your mother. She was not there. No.

224
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:45.330
Cause my mother, she never took us together.

225
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.970
She only took us her own and she would always leave.

226
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:54.210
And so I said, no, I don't want you to do this to me.

227
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.073
I don't like this.

228
00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.080
<v 0>Something snapped. Tell him, yeah, I was 14.</v>

229
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:02.580
<v 1>I was a bit bigger. Know I was a teenager. And I just said, no,</v>

230
00:14:02.581 --> 00:14:05.370
this is not acceptable. Don't do this.

231
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.420
And he got very aggressive and I managed to get out of his room. Um,

232
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:13.170
I managed to get out of his house. Um, I got into the street,

233
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.130
I got down to the chief station.

234
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.510
And in those days you could jump on the tube for free.

235
00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:19.650
So I jumped over the thing.

236
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:24.030
So I got back to our village and I walked home and I got back into bed

237
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.313
in our room.

238
00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:30.600
And I woke up in the morning and I came out for breakfast and my mum was super

239
00:14:30.601 --> 00:14:34.230
shocked to see me. I looked at her, she looked at me and I went like that.

240
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:39.420
And she knew that it was done as in no one's touching us.

241
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:43.770
<v 0>Did she stop as well then? Yes. I mean, everything stopped.</v>

242
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.840
<v 1>Yeah. She knew that, that, that was the end. Yeah. We didn't speak about it.</v>

243
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.250
I just gave her a look as to say, this is over.

244
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.900
<v 0>Could you, I mean, you shared a room, you, you,</v>

245
00:14:54.901 --> 00:14:57.830
you spent a lot of time together. Could you talk about that then? No.

246
00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:01.810
<v 1>I mean, not, I don't believe that any abuse kids talk about it, we don't do it.</v>

247
00:15:01.811 --> 00:15:05.470
And the thing that we all do is silence.

248
00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.370
All people who get sexually abused,

249
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:14.620
who are watching this show know that the biggest power that they have is

250
00:15:14.621 --> 00:15:18.280
fear and silence. And we're here during break it out.

251
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:34.540
<v 0>[Inaudible] it's um, uh,</v>

252
00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.850
the fact is, I mean, this, this story is,

253
00:15:39.851 --> 00:15:44.080
has affected so many people, uh, and it's been, uh, it's been, uh,

254
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.530
like 70 countries, uh, all over the world. Uh,

255
00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.040
people have been watching this and, uh, this documentary that you made.

256
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:56.730
Um, and I, I guess I know that for you, it's,

257
00:15:56.731 --> 00:16:00.820
it's not really a story about Peter files.

258
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.240
<v 1>No, I don't think we've made a movie about sexual abuse.</v>

259
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.270
Aren't we don't feel that we've done that. We feel it's a love story.

260
00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:10.480
It's a love story between two brothers and it's about our life.

261
00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:11.980
And it's about how twins operate.

262
00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.110
And it's about a life that happens to be a part of it.

263
00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:18.910
<v 0>But th because at first you were angry about the lies, but can you today,</v>

264
00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.950
can you see that was,

265
00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:24.830
this fantasy was built out of some kind of love.

266
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.590
<v 1>It was a gift, but he gave me was a gift and I can only see it only in one way.</v>

267
00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.710
And we joke about it. And he says, he gave me,

268
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.820
he gave me a free pass and he got a free pass and he didn't have a fridge.

269
00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:46.300
<v 0>[Inaudible] would you wish that you never got to know?</v>

270
00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:47.951
<v 1>Uh, no.</v>

271
00:16:47.951 --> 00:16:50.790
So I think as you get more mature and you get older and you have children,

272
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.610
you have your own family then to, to be denied all of that information.

273
00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.280
I just don't think I could handle that. So, yes,

274
00:16:57.281 --> 00:16:58.930
I didn't want that information when I was 20.

275
00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:03.070
I couldn't have handled it all authority. If so, to have it later on in life,

276
00:17:03.071 --> 00:17:04.990
I could intellectualize it and deal with it.

277
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.250
So we're closer now than we've ever been. Yeah. And we got,

278
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.600
we got our 10% back at the end of the, at the end of the documentary,

279
00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:18.280
we just, we sat at a table and we'd discuss why we did it and why I did what,

280
00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:20.470
and then we both understand each other's points.

281
00:17:21.370 --> 00:17:26.320
Like I understood why he needed to know which I hadn't ever really

282
00:17:26.321 --> 00:17:29.830
grasped. Um, and he understood why I didn't tell him.

283
00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:34.060
And then we had a hug of the end of it. I mean, it was,

284
00:17:34.090 --> 00:17:38.680
it was an amazing moment in the studio and because we're identical

285
00:17:38.681 --> 00:17:41.680
twins, we finished, we wrapped up, we said, thank you very much.

286
00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.080
We went to the pub and I said, we're good. He went, we're good.

287
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:49.530
And we've never spoken about it again. We told about it, live here.

288
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.350
[inaudible] But these crimes, uh, no, a mother, my mother got a free pass.

289
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:08.390
She died, lucky her and, um, and the other men,

290
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:11.900
we don't really know. I mean, a lot of people say, well, let's go and find them.

291
00:18:11.901 --> 00:18:15.250
It's like, you know what? I was 10 years old. I was in a strange man's house.

292
00:18:15.251 --> 00:18:18.470
I don't know his name. I don't know his address. I don't know where he lives.

293
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.440
I don't really know what he looks like because they're all kind of voting to

294
00:18:21.441 --> 00:18:26.360
each other. And they're middle-aged men. I mean, c'mon, and so it's,

295
00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.720
um, I've decided that, you know what, my life's is moving forward.

296
00:18:29.721 --> 00:18:33.680
I'm not going to go back. I'm not going to go chasing ghosts. You know,

297
00:18:33.681 --> 00:18:38.300
I'd rather come out here and talk to you guys as difficult as it is and

298
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:42.410
get people to break the silence, uh, move it forward. And that,

299
00:18:42.411 --> 00:18:45.680
and that's that attacks the Peter files more than going to try and find them.

300
00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:46.790
Yeah. Some nights.

301
00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:50.180
This is interesting because people are going to happen because when people start

302
00:18:50.181 --> 00:18:51.800
coming here. So I went to tell you a story.

303
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:55.460
So I had the taxi that arrived at my house this morning in London,

304
00:18:55.670 --> 00:19:00.050
in Notting Hill gate at seven o'clock in the morning, his name was Mike.

305
00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.390
He drove me and he said, he thought he'd recognize me.

306
00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.710
I told him about the documentary. And he said, he'd seen it. So I was like,

307
00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:11.360
well, that's very interesting. And I said, well, tell me, why did you,

308
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:13.250
why did you watch that movie? And he said,

309
00:19:13.251 --> 00:19:18.230
because I had something similar in my life. And then we started chatting.

310
00:19:18.231 --> 00:19:20.390
We were in the car for half an hour. And then I just said,

311
00:19:20.391 --> 00:19:22.880
do you mind me asking why? And he said, eventually he said, okay, I'll tell you.

312
00:19:22.881 --> 00:19:25.310
I've never told her living soul, but my brother abused me.

313
00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.570
And we had this very strong conversation. So 20 minutes in the car,

314
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.930
and then he said, he's going to go home and tell his wife tonight,

315
00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.890
killing his wife now. And you just think, you know,

316
00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:39.830
I've just moved that man forward a little bit. And that's what this is about.

317
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.870
<v 0>[Inaudible] victims today.</v>

318
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:51.980
<v 1>No, we do not fill out victims. And we don't think we are survivors.</v>

319
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.930
We're not even like, nearly like that word,

320
00:19:53.931 --> 00:19:58.910
particularly that we are not affected by this. And I think you have a choice.

321
00:19:58.911 --> 00:20:01.190
You can either be it, or you can be evicted for the rest of your life.

322
00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.450
If you want, if you say one,

323
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:06.590
or you could be a survivor and you can try and put it behind you do some therapy

324
00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.650
or you talk to some people and just be neither of those things.

325
00:20:09.651 --> 00:20:12.140
And you can just say, you know what, I'm Marcus Lewis I'm me.

326
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.850
And what happened in my past doesn't shape my future.

327
00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:22.520
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>
