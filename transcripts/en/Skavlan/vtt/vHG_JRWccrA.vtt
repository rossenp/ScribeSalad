00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.280
<v 0>Mary John, welcome to the show.</v>

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.760
Thank you for having me. Uh, I I'm, I,

3
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.620
I'm going to start by asking you, what, what makes you a typical Trump?

4
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.730
<v 1>A typical Joe. Oh, wow. I don't think, um,</v>

5
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.120
I don't know that I have anything in common with anybody in my family, honestly.

6
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.210
Uh, that's a fascinating question.

7
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.770
I I've never really thought about it because in some ways I've always felt so

8
00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:41.300
outside of them because my interests has always been so different,

9
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.730
uh, like across the board, uh, politically, intellectually,

10
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.460
um, you know, I like to read for example, so I,

11
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.620
I honestly don't think I have anything in common with,

12
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.960
uh, anybody left in my dad's family, which I think is a good thing,

13
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.063
honestly.

14
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.280
<v 0>But you do have the genes after all?</v>

15
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.830
<v 1>Uh, yeah. Well, there is a family resemblance that I cannot deny. So.</v>

16
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.960
<v 0>I was, I, I should be honest to say that I was expecting,</v>

17
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.990
uh, a bit more, uh, what should I say? Uh, uh,

18
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.690
lavish interiors and gold-plated, uh, you know,

19
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.243
gold.

20
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.710
<v 1>Uh, it's true that, um,</v>

21
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.060
my grandfather was enormously wealthy and could have

22
00:01:41.061 --> 00:01:45.830
afforded as extravagant lifestyle as he wanted,

23
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.240
but he was also a very provincial person. Um,

24
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.160
first of all, his GRA,

25
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.810
his mother was a very austere person and,

26
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.150
um, he also lived through the depression. So I think there was,

27
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.490
um, a reticence about, uh, being lavish in any way.

28
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.410
So, uh,

29
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.450
at least compared to other people with his wealth, he lived pretty modestly.

30
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.290
Actually, I, I didn't understand when I was a kid,

31
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.240
just how much money my family had.

32
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.480
<v 0>So, so as they, after all, they,</v>

33
00:02:25.481 --> 00:02:29.720
they were quite wealthy. Uh, how, how, how would Christmas be there?

34
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.320
<v 1>I, it was, it was probably the most extravagant,</v>

35
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.740
uh, occasion during the year. Um,

36
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.960
we had it at my grandparents' house there. It was, uh, there was a, uh, around,

37
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.850
um, what do you call it? Uh, entryway.

38
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.400
And I'm so sorry about this. And it was like a 30 foot ceiling.

39
00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.270
So every Christmas my grandfather would like a 25 foot Christmas tree,

40
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.420
but my grandmother would decorate it. Like she would get on a ladder, you know,

41
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.150
she would put the lights on herself, so she had no help.

42
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.620
So on the one hand it was a very overdone,

43
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.820
but on the other hand,

44
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.320
it was just my grandmother doing it single-handedly so,

45
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.790
you know, they didn't know how to enjoy, uh,

46
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.050
their wealth at all.

47
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.870
<v 0>W w w what about gifts?</v>

48
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.040
<v 1>Um, well, they were terrible gift givers. I have to say. Um,</v>

49
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.520
Donald and his first wife Ivana were the worst.

50
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.380
So basically everybody in my family had to give everybody else a gift.

51
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.090
So I had to give all of my aunts and uncles gifts. And so it was ridiculous.

52
00:03:48.091 --> 00:03:52.050
Like there would be dozens and dozens and dozens of packages under the tree.

53
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.550
And since nobody really put a lot of thought into it,

54
00:03:56.551 --> 00:04:00.840
nobody ever got anything that really suited them necessarily, you know,

55
00:04:00.841 --> 00:04:05.130
we would get clothes that were the wrong size or, um,

56
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:06.330
you know,

57
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.310
we would get something that was of no interest to us whatsoever, but,

58
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.560
you know, Donald and Ivana took it to a whole new level. Um, Avanto for example,

59
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.550
was famous for re gifting. So in other words,

60
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.810
she would get a gift from somebody or get something from a luncheon.

61
00:04:24.811 --> 00:04:27.120
She had attended rewrap it,

62
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.070
and then give it to somebody else with Christmas present a one year,

63
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.740
the very first year she was in the family.

64
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.420
She gave me a three pack of underwear, which,

65
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.330
you know, I could use obviously,

66
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.380
but it wasn't exactly a great Christmas present. So, um,

67
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.270
it was sometimes hard not to feel insulted, but my brother and my older cousin,

68
00:04:51.271 --> 00:04:54.210
and I, we just sort of made a joke out of it because, you know,

69
00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:55.044
what are you going to do?

70
00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.400
<v 0>Uh, your, your grandfather was, was Donald Trump's father. Uh,</v>

71
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.030
I, um, how close would you say you were to him?

72
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.540
To my grandfather. Yeah.

73
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.090
<v 1>Right. Not at all. Um,</v>

74
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.140
partially because my grandfather had no use for girls.

75
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.510
Um, but mostly because he, um,

76
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.560
did not like my mother, my, uh, my dad's wife, obviously,

77
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.020
and he did not respect or care for my father who

78
00:05:31.021 --> 00:05:36.000
was, uh, his oldest son either. So I kind of suffered from,

79
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.330
from being their child as well. Uh, so he was,

80
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.130
he was pretty dismissive of me, uh, throughout the course of my life.

81
00:05:44.131 --> 00:05:44.964
And it wasn't, uh,

82
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.530
it wasn't until he had actually forgotten who I was after he developed

83
00:05:49.531 --> 00:05:51.930
Alzheimer's that he actually started being kind to me.

84
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.570
<v 0>So how, how about how his, his wife w were you close?</v>

85
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.920
<v 1>I actually was very close with my grandmother eventually. Um,</v>

86
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.610
not really when I was a kid because, uh, I don't know. We just, you know, we,

87
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.680
it wasn't an affectionate family and I was at their house all the time,

88
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:19.630
but we didn't really have a lot of conversations

89
00:06:19.631 --> 00:06:22.900
necessarily, but a few years after my dad died,

90
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.850
I felt that it was my responsibility to be in her life or to have her in my

91
00:06:27.851 --> 00:06:32.350
life. So I made a, I made a real effort and we got to be very, very close.

92
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.850
Um,

93
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:38.440
I'd say in the maybe four years after my dad died

94
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.330
until my grandfather died. Uh, so, you know, I,

95
00:06:42.331 --> 00:06:45.550
I saw her two or three times a week. We talked on the phone every day.

96
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.610
<v 0>So how well would you say that you got to know your uncle,</v>

97
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.473
the precedent.

98
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.540
<v 1>The thing about Donald is that there's not much to know. Uh,</v>

99
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.430
he is literally exactly the same when he's in front of a

100
00:07:03.431 --> 00:07:08.290
camera as he is when he's with his family or

101
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.880
when he's with the people he works with. So when that's the case,

102
00:07:12.881 --> 00:07:17.260
there really isn't much underneath the surface.

103
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:22.900
Um, so when I worked for him, he hired me in 90,

104
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.070
I think it was 1993 to write his third book for him.

105
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.480
And that was really the first time as an adult that I spent that much time with

106
00:07:31.481 --> 00:07:36.310
him. I saw him every day. Um, and we traveled together sometimes.

107
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.690
And, um,

108
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.060
it was remarkable how little I got to know

109
00:07:43.061 --> 00:07:44.950
him, because as I said,

110
00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:49.720
there just wasn't that much to know what you see with Donald is pretty much what

111
00:07:49.721 --> 00:07:50.554
you get.

112
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.140
<v 0>Why, why do you think he wanted you to write that book?</v>

113
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:55.690
<v 1>Um,</v>

114
00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:00.670
because I went to Tufts university and I had

115
00:08:00.671 --> 00:08:05.560
written a letter to the Dean of students recommending one of my

116
00:08:05.561 --> 00:08:10.180
professors for tenure. And after I graduated,

117
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:14.500
the Dean sent this letter to Donald basically to say, look,

118
00:08:14.501 --> 00:08:18.880
ma Mary loves Tufts so much. It was sort of a fundraising ploy. Right.

119
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.130
But when Donald read the letter,

120
00:08:21.131 --> 00:08:25.600
what he saw was that I was really good at complimenting people.

121
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.310
So he thought that that would be a views, uh,

122
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.640
in somebody who wrote his next book.

123
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.113
Um.

124
00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:41.020
<v 0>Your, the way you describe your grandfather,</v>

125
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.760
it must have been kind of a tough upbringing for your

126
00:08:45.761 --> 00:08:50.500
father, Fred, the older brother, and also for, for Donal. Uh,

127
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:55.030
but they, they dealt very differently with that upbringing.

128
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.163
Yeah.

129
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:03.320
<v 1>Was it a very difficult household to grow up in? And,</v>

130
00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.070
um, I think all of the children, all five of them suffered,

131
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.390
but particularly my dad, because he was the oldest son,

132
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.080
he was the namesake. He was supposed to take over the empire.

133
00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.990
And from a fairly young age,

134
00:09:17.991 --> 00:09:22.700
I imagine my grandfather saw things in my dad. He did not admire,

135
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.730
um, you know, he wasn't tough. It was actually quite sensitive. He was kind,

136
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:34.520
he was funny and he had interests outside of real estate.

137
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:38.930
You know, he loved boats and fishing and he went on to be, become a pilot.

138
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:40.220
And, uh,

139
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:45.080
because he didn't fit the mold of what my grandfather expected him to be.

140
00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:47.360
He punished him very severely. Um,

141
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:52.340
my dad was subjected to lots of humiliation growing up and,

142
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:56.540
um, you know, Donald witnessed this cause he was seven and a half years younger.

143
00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:02.000
The difference was that eventually to

144
00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:04.790
protect himself really from the same kinds of abuse,

145
00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:09.530
my dad got Donald developed personality traits, uh,

146
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:14.480
that, you know, most people wouldn't admire. Um, you know,

147
00:10:14.481 --> 00:10:19.160
he was a bully. He would do anything to win, including lying, cheating,

148
00:10:19.161 --> 00:10:23.450
and stealing what my grandfather actually did value those characteristics.

149
00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.290
So they kind of became hardened and, you know, that's,

150
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.860
that's why we see how Donald is today. Honestly.

151
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.040
<v 0>So, so, so in your view, how,</v>

152
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:38.720
how do you think he might respond to losing? I mean, if that's going to happen.

153
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.150
<v 1>Very badly, uh, you know, we, we need to be really,</v>

154
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.510
clear-eyed about what might happen. First of all,

155
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:52.340
he's going to do anything in his power to make sure that doesn't happen. Uh,

156
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.310
and we already see he's cheating already. Um, you know,

157
00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:59.930
by telling people that it isn't safe to vote by mail in the middle of a

158
00:10:59.931 --> 00:11:03.920
pandemic by telling people that if Joe Biden wins, it,

159
00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:07.130
it will have been rigged. You know, that's cheating, uh,

160
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.360
because he's using the power of the oval office to get that message across

161
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:16.070
if however, uh, Giovanna does win. Um,

162
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.350
it kind of depends on the margin of victory,

163
00:11:18.351 --> 00:11:23.270
if it's a huge landslide and nobody can pretend that it's an illegitimate

164
00:11:23.271 --> 00:11:28.250
result. I think Donald is much more likely to try to spin it as

165
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.680
America's loss. You know,

166
00:11:30.681 --> 00:11:33.860
he was the best thing that ever happened to this country and we don't deserve

167
00:11:33.861 --> 00:11:36.800
him. So he's going to go do something really important,

168
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:41.690
like build Trump tower in Moscow or something, if it's close,

169
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.140
I think we're in for a very, very rough period of time.

170
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:51.860
<v 0>You you've you've, uh, go call them a narcissist. And, uh,</v>

171
00:11:51.861 --> 00:11:55.330
and as you are the psychologist, uh,

172
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.830
I must ask you why, how, how can you give him, uh, uh,

173
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.750
diagnosed without even treating him?

174
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.130
<v 1>I actually don't diagnose him, uh,</v>

175
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.690
because it's technically impossible to diagnose somebody who is not your

176
00:12:09.691 --> 00:12:14.400
patient. You know, it requires a very specific procedure, uh,

177
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.670
which he wouldn't submit to, and he's not my patient. So what I,

178
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:22.650
what I try to do in the book is help people understand how many

179
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:26.880
symptoms he has, uh, various personality disorders.

180
00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:28.950
So, um,

181
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.870
people can see just how complex is psych

182
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.930
psychopathology is, are because, you know,

183
00:12:36.931 --> 00:12:39.540
I think the diagnosis isn't really that important.

184
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:42.330
It's his behavior that we need to pay attention to.

185
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:46.530
And if you look at his behavior, you can see that this is not a well person.

186
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.220
<v 0>Um, would you, um, w w if,</v>

187
00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:57.900
if he were to, to, to lie on your coach, what would you ask him?

188
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:01.560
<v 1>Uh,</v>

189
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.580
but it's so hard for me to imagine his ever putting himself in that position.

190
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.220
Um, you know, I would honestly

191
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:14.100
I'd ask him to start at the beginning because that's what we do. Um,

192
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:19.110
but I'm not entirely sure we

193
00:13:19.111 --> 00:13:23.070
could get anywhere because somebody with his kinds of disorders,

194
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.790
when they do go to therapy, which is rare,

195
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.830
they claim that the problem is everybody else, you know,

196
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.150
they're perfectly fine,

197
00:13:33.151 --> 00:13:36.840
but it's the rest of the world that's causing them grief.

198
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.550
It's the rest of the world.

199
00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:43.110
That's making impossible for them to function properly. So, um,

200
00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.060
you know, I, I, you know,

201
00:13:45.061 --> 00:13:49.770
one question I might ask him is what are you so

202
00:13:49.771 --> 00:13:50.604
afraid of?

203
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.830
And it would be very difficult if not impossible for him to acknowledge that,

204
00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.450
but I continued to believe that Donald's biggest

205
00:14:00.451 --> 00:14:04.680
problem is that deep down, he is a terrified little boy,

206
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:06.180
and he's never gotten.

207
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:11.550
<v 0>W what kind of experience do you have with them that makes you say that?</v>

208
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.090
<v 1>Well, you know, I've known him my whole life and I've,</v>

209
00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:18.300
I've seen how things have unfolded,

210
00:14:18.301 --> 00:14:22.950
but I also have access to family history. You know, um,

211
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.900
I have stories. I was, as I said, close with my grandmother,

212
00:14:27.901 --> 00:14:32.760
I wasn't one time close with one of my aunts. Um, my dad died when I was 16,

213
00:14:32.761 --> 00:14:37.020
but, you know, I still had plenty of stories from him as well,

214
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.570
and other people who knew the family.

215
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:44.310
So I can say that with confidence in part,

216
00:14:44.311 --> 00:14:45.960
because, um,

217
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.980
it is factually true that my grandmother became very,

218
00:14:49.981 --> 00:14:51.770
very ill when Donald two and a half,

219
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.000
and was essentially absent from his life for about a year.

220
00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:00.950
I know that my grandfather was a sociopath and was incapable

221
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:06.410
and unwilling to take over her role. So for about a year,

222
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:11.060
this toddler had nobody to sooth

223
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:13.700
him, had nobody to be affectionate,

224
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:17.120
had nobody to tell him that he didn't need to be afraid,

225
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:22.700
but there was nothing done after that to repair those wounds.

226
00:15:22.701 --> 00:15:25.640
It only got worse. Uh, that's a very,

227
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:30.560
very terrible time in a child's life to be abandoned by the one

228
00:15:30.561 --> 00:15:34.970
person in the world who is, you know, your main human connection.

229
00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:40.700
<v 0>And Mariam. I'm sure you're aware of, of, uh, of the precedent tweeting, uh,</v>

230
00:15:40.701 --> 00:15:45.670
about you and your book, uh, and, uh, among all the things he wrote that,

231
00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.190
uh, he,

232
00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:52.030
he describes you as a seldom see niece who knows little

233
00:15:52.031 --> 00:15:52.571
about me,

234
00:15:52.571 --> 00:15:56.530
says untruthful things about my wonderful parents who couldn't stand her.

235
00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:58.660
What's your comment on that?

236
00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:04.210
<v 1>I'm not entirely sure why he thought that that would make me look bad, but,</v>

237
00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:12.130
you know, he seems to forget that, uh, if I'm his niece, he's also my uncle.

238
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:13.900
And, um,

239
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.640
I think he also said that I was unloved from the moment I was born,

240
00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:24.100
which I'm not entirely sure what I did when I was an infant to make people

241
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.280
not love me. But again, it's just, it's a,

242
00:16:27.281 --> 00:16:31.900
it's a commentary on him and his parents,

243
00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:34.540
if that were indeed the case. Um,

244
00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:38.800
so as often happens with Donald,

245
00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:43.840
he lashes out in a way that ends up hurting him. Um,

246
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:47.650
and also I, he can say whatever he wants to about me, it doesn't,

247
00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.320
it doesn't have any impact on me,

248
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.290
but I found it a curious line of attack.

249
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:57.730
He would have been better served if he just ignored me in the book entirely.

250
00:16:58.690 --> 00:16:59.380
Do you.

251
00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:02.710
<v 0>You are, I know you that you are in the middle of a lawsuit. Uh,</v>

252
00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:07.280
w w where do your family, and also you, you written this book. I mean, do you,

253
00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:11.950
do you at one level feel that you have betrayed them willingly?

254
00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.860
<v 1>No. Uh, because they were never loyal to me.</v>

255
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:22.870
It's I don't see how you can betray people who

256
00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:28.300
were never there for you in any capacity that mattered. And it's interesting,

257
00:17:28.301 --> 00:17:32.830
like I don't ever hear anybody asking him that question about whether or not he

258
00:17:32.831 --> 00:17:37.390
betrayed me, so I don't see it that way. I see,

259
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.290
I wrote the book mostly as an American citizen, uh,

260
00:17:41.291 --> 00:17:45.310
as somebody who's deeply concerned about what's happening in my country,

261
00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.670
the lawsuit is really, um,

262
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:54.300
a way of getting justice. These were my aunts and uncles who,

263
00:17:54.301 --> 00:17:59.190
after my dad died at the age of 42 committed financial fraud

264
00:17:59.191 --> 00:18:00.024
against me,

265
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:04.410
and kept me out of my fair share out of my dad's inheritance.

266
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:07.740
So I see the lawsuit as, um,

267
00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:12.270
a way to get my stolen property returned to me, quite honestly.

268
00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.140
<v 0>Um, I want to, because I'm sitting here with, with, uh,</v>

269
00:18:17.141 --> 00:18:20.320
a TV anchor that has covered many precedents.

270
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.260
I just wonder when you hear this, the, my, my,

271
00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:28.610
my interview with, with, uh, Mary, uh, Clawson, what, what are your thoughts?

272
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:33.800
<v 2>Well, I think a lot about it. Uh, it's a one-sided story, of course,</v>

273
00:18:33.801 --> 00:18:37.310
because it's, it's one person against the rest of the family,

274
00:18:37.311 --> 00:18:42.080
but I wanted more Mary what's happening to you after you published the book,

275
00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.580
how are people treating you?

276
00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.480
<v 1>Um, and I agree with you, of course, it's, it's, it's one sided, but I,</v>

277
00:18:49.481 --> 00:18:50.600
I will say though,

278
00:18:50.601 --> 00:18:54.650
that it's backed up by family history and stories,

279
00:18:54.651 --> 00:18:58.250
I was able to get from other people. Um, but you're right. It's,

280
00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.410
it's decidedly my point of view.

281
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:05.150
So I encourage everybody to take it with a grain of salt, if necessary, uh,

282
00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:08.240
in terms of what it's been like after the book came out,

283
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:14.690
you know, we're, we're on lockdown because of COVID. So in a really weird way,

284
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.660
nothing's changed. Um, I mean,

285
00:19:17.661 --> 00:19:22.370
I get to have interesting conversations via zoom with people

286
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:26.570
I've never met before, so that's great, but, um, you know,

287
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.330
I'm still in my house. Um,

288
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.080
I'm I live in New York and we got hit very, very hard.

289
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:38.090
So I've not really ventured out very much, uh,

290
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:40.940
since March. Um,

291
00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:44.570
so it's a little, uh, I mean,

292
00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:46.730
I was going to say frustrating, but, you know,

293
00:19:46.731 --> 00:19:50.930
so many people are so much worse off than I am, but, you know,

294
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.810
in a small way, it's frustrating that it it's,

295
00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:58.610
it's hard for me to gauge how the book's been received if it's

296
00:19:58.611 --> 00:20:02.990
having any kind of impact. Um, but the,

297
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.670
the extent to which my life hasn't changed at all is kind of remarkable.

298
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.080
And it's because of COVID.

299
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:14.720
<v 2>Do you have any contact with, with anyone in the family now?</v>

300
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.510
<v 1>I don't. And I didn't anticipate that I would, and I understand that. I mean,</v>

301
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.140
why should they want to have contact with me? Um,

302
00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:28.610
I think that's completely a completely fair response, but, you know,

303
00:20:28.611 --> 00:20:31.400
I also went into this with my eyes wide open. Uh,

304
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:34.670
these are vindictive people and, you know,

305
00:20:34.671 --> 00:20:39.230
I had to take the necessary precautions because like, it or not,

306
00:20:39.231 --> 00:20:43.130
Donald does have a lot of power and he does have a lot of followers.

307
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.140
So, uh, you know,

308
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:50.110
I've been in a way COVID has also made it easier for me to be careful. Okay.

309
00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:55.800
<v 0>What, uh, hello. Um, when I was 17,</v>

310
00:20:55.801 --> 00:20:59.310
I was an exchange student in North Dakota. You should go there.

311
00:20:59.311 --> 00:21:04.020
It's a very lovely place. Uh, the friends from high school there,

312
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:04.380
uh,

313
00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:08.190
that's my focus group in the U S and they think Trump is going to win because

314
00:21:08.191 --> 00:21:12.030
they don't like, uh, communism. So, uh,

315
00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.770
what if the polls are wrong again?

316
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.700
<v 1>Oh, well, I mean,</v>

317
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:22.620
that's why I don't sleep anymore because we're all still traumatized from

318
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.860
2016. Um, you know,

319
00:21:25.861 --> 00:21:30.810
it's interesting in a terrifying way, um,

320
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:35.730
that people in North Dakota are still able to have that attitude when

321
00:21:35.731 --> 00:21:39.870
first of all, Joe Biden is as far from a communist,

322
00:21:39.871 --> 00:21:44.730
as you can get and, you know, still be a Democrat. I mean,

323
00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:48.150
I am so far to the left of Joe Biden.

324
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:52.740
It's amazing that anybody can try to

325
00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:57.210
pin the label of socialist or communist on him. And I think it's,

326
00:21:57.211 --> 00:22:01.920
it's a condemnation of our system of education that people don't even

327
00:22:01.921 --> 00:22:06.330
understand what these terms mean. Um, but beyond that, uh,

328
00:22:06.331 --> 00:22:09.660
I don't know if you, you have seen the numbers recently,

329
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:14.580
North Dakota is on fire with COVID-19

330
00:22:14.581 --> 00:22:19.560
infections right now. It's absolutely horrifying.

331
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:22.890
I mean, they have the highest rate of infection.

332
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:28.260
I think in the world right now is like 76 per a hundred thousand.

333
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:29.940
It's through the roof,

334
00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:34.800
it's a straight line up and there's only one

335
00:22:34.801 --> 00:22:36.450
person to blame for this.

336
00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.860
And yet they're worried that Joe Biden might be a communist it's, um,

337
00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.650
it's very concerning because I think it does suggest that there's

338
00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:51.450
a possibly a stronger possibility than there might

339
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:55.260
otherwise have been, uh, that Donald has a shot at it.

340
00:22:55.261 --> 00:22:57.660
I hope that's not the case, but you know,

341
00:22:57.661 --> 00:23:00.330
it's something we need to take very seriously.

342
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.360
<v 0>Mary. I know you've been generous with your time.</v>

343
00:23:03.361 --> 00:23:05.820
I just have two more questions. I'm one that's from Leumi.

344
00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:11.970
<v 3>Um, sure. So we were, hi, it's it's, uh, an honor to meet you.</v>

345
00:23:11.971 --> 00:23:16.290
And you did ask if you think your book have some kind of impact than it does,

346
00:23:16.291 --> 00:23:20.970
you know, we in Europe has been a lot of conversations about you and your book,

347
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.050
so it's definitely creating waves. Um, but we just,

348
00:23:25.051 --> 00:23:27.630
before you came on, we were talking about, um,

349
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:33.240
advice and who you would take advice from, and who would you give advice to?

350
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.400
Who, who, who guided you,

351
00:23:35.401 --> 00:23:40.260
who made you become a person that has the bravery and the strength

352
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.460
to go against and stand up for something in,

353
00:23:43.461 --> 00:23:46.240
in a situation where it's quite scary, must be quite scary.

354
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:47.143
<v 0>For you?</v>

355
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.980
<v 1>Uh, well, first of all, thank you for that. I really appreciate it. Um,</v>

356
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.920
and secondly, I think there,

357
00:23:55.670 --> 00:24:00.590
I think I'm missing something because it didn't feel like it took courage to do

358
00:24:00.591 --> 00:24:04.760
this. It felt like something I had to do. I had an obligation,

359
00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:09.680
I had information that could help the American people understand the danger

360
00:24:09.681 --> 00:24:14.330
we're in, um, and it just needed to be done,

361
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:19.280
you know, um, because also, like I think of bravery and I think of,

362
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:19.760
of,

363
00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.440
of people who take their families pack up everything they own and

364
00:24:24.441 --> 00:24:28.700
travel thousands of miles across hostile territory to seek refuge in a country

365
00:24:28.701 --> 00:24:30.740
that then rejects them. You know, that's courage,

366
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:35.690
courage in America to me is being a person of color raising a black

367
00:24:35.691 --> 00:24:39.230
child. Uh, you know, so I guess I,

368
00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:43.250
I kind of just compare what I I've done to things like that.

369
00:24:43.251 --> 00:24:48.140
And it doesn't seem like it really took that much courage

370
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:52.700
and I'm actually not afraid because, um,

371
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:55.610
despite the fact that Donald is in a position of power,

372
00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:00.110
I've known him forever and he's the weakest person I've ever known.

373
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:04.220
So it just, it's impossible for me to be afraid of him.

374
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.350
<v 0>Where finally, when was the last time you met her?</v>

375
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:12.550
<v 1>I was at the white house, uh,</v>

376
00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:17.110
in April of 2017 for my aunt's birthday parties. Uh,

377
00:25:17.111 --> 00:25:17.701
so that's,

378
00:25:17.701 --> 00:25:22.240
that's the last time I saw him and the time before that was

379
00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:27.400
eight years earlier and my cousin Ivanka's wedding and then eight years before

380
00:25:27.401 --> 00:25:31.300
that, uh, because the lawsuit kind of makes it when you Sue your family,

381
00:25:31.301 --> 00:25:33.610
it kind of makes it difficult to keep having holidays.

382
00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.270
<v 0>Describe that, describe that,</v>

383
00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.690
that last meeting you had with him at the white house, how was that?

384
00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:46.360
<v 1>It was actually kind of fascinating in a way. Um,</v>

385
00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:51.610
it was very stressful, but, um, when I first saw,

386
00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.080
you know, we, we had a tour,

387
00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:57.760
but I didn't see Donald until we got to the dining room and he was standing in

388
00:25:57.761 --> 00:26:01.300
the entryway. And when he saw me,

389
00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:04.390
he pointed at me and he smiled and he said,

390
00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.660
I specifically asked for you to be invited,

391
00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:10.780
which was a lie. Um,

392
00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:15.460
but it tells you so much about his psychology because

393
00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.550
he knew it was a lie. He probably knew I knew,

394
00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:24.070
but he one wanted to take credit for it. And two,

395
00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:29.020
it was actually charming, right? Like if I had believed him,

396
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:33.850
I would have been entirely charmed by that. So, uh,

397
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:38.740
I thought that was fascinating that he hadn't changed a bit since I'd last

398
00:26:38.741 --> 00:26:40.510
seen him not surprisingly.

399
00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:44.670
And this is what you were I'm so sorry.

400
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.330
Was that a surprise to him that you came? Did he know?

401
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.710
He looked surprised, but I don't know.

402
00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:56.100
I don't know if he saw the list ahead of time or not. I would assume he did.

403
00:26:56.550 --> 00:27:01.110
So I'm not sure why he looked as surprised as he did, but it was an odd moment.

404
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:04.680
And he also, for the very first time in my life hugged me,

405
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:09.420
which was also kind of shocking. Um, and then at the very end,

406
00:27:09.421 --> 00:27:14.010
after the meal and we were taking pictures with him, uh,

407
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.950
I said to him, and this was very early on in the administration,

408
00:27:16.951 --> 00:27:21.630
but things were already going badly. Um, so I said to him,

409
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:26.040
don't let them get you down. And he clenched his teeth and he said,

410
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:29.010
they're not going to get me. Um,

411
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:33.000
and so far he's, uh, been right.

412
00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.320
<v 0>Why, why do you think you said that.</v>

413
00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:42.980
<v 1>I wanted to get under his skin a little bit? Honestly,</v>

414
00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:46.430
I don't know. I mean, I didn't plan it. It just kind of happened.

415
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:50.630
So I've often thought about that too. Why did I say that to him? Um,

416
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:53.300
I think it was a way to get under his skin without,

417
00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:57.560
without appearing to be aggressive about it, you know?

418
00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.220
Um, but I'm, I'm still not sure,

419
00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:06.110
but his answer was kind of perfect and it wasn't just what he said.

420
00:28:06.111 --> 00:28:10.280
It was the way he said it and the way he clenched his draw. Uh,

421
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:15.260
so even then I could see that he was under the kind of stress that he'd

422
00:28:15.261 --> 00:28:16.850
never been in in his life.

423
00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:24.380
<v 0>Um, I'm so grateful that you, you found the time to talk to us from New York.</v>

424
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:29.990
Um, if you were to say one nice thing about your uncle before we wrap up,

425
00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:30.853
what would that be?

426
00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:35.450
<v 1>Uh, first of all, I hope you guys will let me move there.</v>

427
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:40.610
If things don't go well in November, that would be great. Um,

428
00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:44.990
in all serious, no seriousness though. Um,

429
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:49.430
and this isn't something I enjoy saying. I can't think of one thing.

430
00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.960
<v 0>Well, then, uh, we'll have to leave it at that.</v>

431
00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:00.410
Thank you very much. And, uh, um, the, what should I say?

432
00:29:00.411 --> 00:29:01.580
Good night and good luck.

433
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:05.900
<v 1>You too. Thank you. This was wonderful. It was great to meet all of you.</v>

434
00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.213
<v 0>Thank you very much.</v>

435
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:13.970
