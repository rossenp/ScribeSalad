1
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.060
<v 0>Many years ago you've been quiet. I mean,</v>

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.080
nah, I don't know, friendly, but do you know Donald Trump? Uh, and you've,

3
00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:14.000
you've said some nice things about him. Uh, is that something you,

4
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:16.380
you regret or do you, do you stand by that?

5
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.220
<v 1>Uh, set me up with a saw then, but not what I see now. Uh,</v>

6
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.380
unfortunately, uh, he has misused his talents.

7
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.730
He's a very talented man.

8
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.650
<v 0>Welcome. Welcome to Stockholm and welcome to this. I'm nervous.</v>

9
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.250
[inaudible] so, but it's, eh, I mean, you're,

10
00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:51.020
you're famous as a people person. What, what, what would you say is, is, um,

11
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.610
the best way to connect with people?

12
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.010
<v 1>Be authentic, uh, care, uh, to be,</v>

13
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.660
to be genuine. People care that you know,

14
00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:05.510
but they will know that you care a lot of people know,

15
00:01:05.511 --> 00:01:08.750
but they don't seem to care and something like Karen connects.

16
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.940
<v 0>Do do you, when, when you,</v>

17
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.530
when you S w w when you give a speech and you've given a lot of famous

18
00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:18.890
speeches, do you do improvise a lot,

19
00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:22.010
or do you write them before you.

20
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.500
<v 1>Often, often I write them, but it's according to the occasion sometimes,</v>

21
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.970
uh, speeches as be expressed.

22
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.890
If they're read just like kissing through a telephone something's missing.

23
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.990
<v 0>But when, when you get a thought here, uh,</v>

24
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.620
when she wants to know something, when she wants to learn something,

25
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:49.460
she can Google,

26
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.490
but you grew up in absolute poverty and you grew up in a time without the

27
00:01:55.491 --> 00:01:58.340
internet. How did you, how did you learn things?

28
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.320
How did you find out about the world?

29
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.250
<v 1>Well, by the experience, um, uh,</v>

30
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.810
got on the bus with my mother and I had to go to the back of the bus. Uh, I, uh,

31
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:12.200
wanted to sit up front so I could see with other children, the white children,

32
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.240
and they were told to stay, and I had to leave. Then my mother, Penn,

33
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.370
Smithfield humiliated. One of my father's friends said to me, don't cry.

34
00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:23.120
She's she?

35
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.040
She pinched you because she loves you and you teach your children to adjust so

36
00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:31.240
they won't get hurt. They won't, they won't be violated. So that,

37
00:02:31.241 --> 00:02:32.840
that was an experience. Another experience.

38
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.760
I came home from college and I had those speeds of 25 annotated,

39
00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:42.560
bibliographies, and, uh, w the color lab where they didn't have enough books.

40
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.650
So she told me go to the other, the central library,

41
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.190
her friend was the librarian, and I rushed down.

42
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.760
And two police happened to me with a two police.

43
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.270
And I gave him the sheet. I expected you. They're going to get the books.

44
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.760
You said in seven,

45
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.770
no one was in the library with me. And, uh, I had to get back to school earlier.

46
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.000
And I said, well, let me go downstairs. I'll get that conducted myself.

47
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:13.600
She said, no. And the police said, you're here, but she say it.

48
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:16.570
I walked out in the back end. I cried. I was hurt,

49
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.420
humiliated violated.

50
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.140
And that summer seven classmates,

51
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.980
we were arrested trying to use the public library.

52
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:31.090
That was a real experience. Later on, we did, we saved building elaborate.

53
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:35.920
You don't have to move with you this. And we'd be, we began the process. Uh,

54
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.750
and that process led us to, uh,

55
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.980
we ended up going to Washington when Dr. King gave the speech that I have a

56
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:44.840
dream speech. And most of us were there had the, uh,

57
00:03:44.841 --> 00:03:47.590
the honor of having men jailed.

58
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.350
And I became free of jails and death at that time.

59
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.130
And what most people don't realize the context of that speech,

60
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.470
the day he gave that speech from Texas across the floor left to

61
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:03.580
Maryland. We couldn't use a single public toilet in the state Capitol.

62
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.620
The day he gave this speech,

63
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.130
we couldn't buy ice cream in holiday at Howard Johnson,

64
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:10.960
we couldn't buy

65
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.150
[inaudible] was counterfeited black and Latino soldiers had to sit behind

66
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.150
Knott's appeal debits in American military basis.

67
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.720
We lived under the degradation of apartheid. So it was,

68
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.330
I didn't have to Google as it was, I was living it.

69
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.140
And we use a lot of word of mouth at that time,

70
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.140
as opposed to the scientific process that we have that,

71
00:04:32.141 --> 00:04:34.270
but we had our own way of I'm going to,

72
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.110
we'll be kind of the cities that were most depressive. Uh,

73
00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.660
we chose to go to them to try to open up the doors.

74
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.810
<v 2>[Inaudible], what's your strongest memory of poverty.</v>

75
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.030
<v 1>It's a song has been repotted is in the winter time when it's real cold.</v>

76
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.330
And my father put up wallpaper,

77
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.960
not for decoration with the breakthrough win and had to sleep

78
00:05:06.961 --> 00:05:08.550
on the, on the cop and my brother.

79
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.140
So we could feel each other and stay warm at night. That's poverty.

80
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.550
Uh, my father going to the grocery store with my father on the weekend.

81
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.130
He could count, but not the fractions.

82
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.010
So like I've had six eggs for a dollar and then 12 eggs for a dollar,

83
00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.090
that type thing. Uh, we would be searching to get groceries. And he said,

84
00:05:30.091 --> 00:05:32.520
I have $9 to get roasted with this week.

85
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.570
And we went over like nine 30 to nine 25.

86
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.520
We had to figure out what to put back in line with other people looking at us.

87
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.220
I mean, the idea that you go between the 5 cents or 50 cents,

88
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.080
because you misread, or they, uh, some calculus of sorts that's poverty.

89
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.963
<v 2>And yet.</v>

90
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.360
<v 1>Poverty, maybe the after some money, but spirit is the presence of faith.</v>

91
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.260
And faith must be stronger than you than your predicament. You have to,

92
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.680
we never saw ourselves as poor. We just didn't have enough money, enough money,

93
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.610
and the will to fight back is an enriching experience.

94
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.530
And that's what it is because you were born in the slum does not mean Islam was

95
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:16.091
born in you.

96
00:06:16.091 --> 00:06:20.930
You have to have the power within somebody within must say that you

97
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:22.130
deserve dignity.

98
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.050
<v 0>What do you want to describe as is, I mean, a lot of humiliating experiences.</v>

99
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.390
Do you think that they fueled your activism, that they have been important for,

100
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.120
for you being an activist your whole life?

101
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:43.300
<v 1>Well, my life's predicament put them in, in that situation. I mean,</v>

102
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.550
if someone is some point in life, you'll find what's fulfilling for you.

103
00:06:48.551 --> 00:06:51.190
What matters to you? Uh,

104
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.560
caring for people matters more to me than, than money. For example,

105
00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:01.120
that the King was a, you must be materialistic than minded, man.

106
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.720
That's the materialistic in numbers, serials to do the stuff you need to do,

107
00:07:04.721 --> 00:07:07.570
but not caught up in law. The frivolous stuff.

108
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.700
<v 0>Is this what you would tell a young activist? Like [inaudible],</v>

109
00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.040
she she's just started her struggle.

110
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.950
<v 1>W when you are blessed with the sensitive that she has you search for your</v>

111
00:07:20.951 --> 00:07:21.970
environment, for example,

112
00:07:21.971 --> 00:07:25.690
if she were to come to American Dayton and she was a black child,

113
00:07:25.691 --> 00:07:28.610
and she's on the front of the bus, that doesn't,

114
00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:32.650
that doesn't require her resistance goes it's, the Victor has been one,

115
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.680
but climate change is real.

116
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:41.080
So you have to search for the issue of your time. Immigration is a real issue.

117
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.090
Gender inequality is a real issue. So that, that, that stuff to fight,

118
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.370
to give them a sense of that. You matter.

119
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:50.613
<v 0>Um,</v>

120
00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:59.300
[inaudible] we got to talk about Dr. King. Um, he,

121
00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:01.900
you were here in Stockholm to celebrate him.

122
00:08:01.901 --> 00:08:04.900
You were invited by then the Nobel museum. Uh,

123
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.850
he would have turned 90 this week.

124
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.860
<v 1>January 15, 19.</v>

125
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.590
<v 0>And, um, I wonder what is in your view,</v>

126
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:20.020
uh, having known him so well, w what is the greatest misconception about,

127
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.250
about Martin Luther King?

128
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:27.880
<v 1>It may be how academic in doubt he was,</v>

129
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:33.340
because he was such a people person. He didn't wear it like a professor per se.

130
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.260
He finished high school at 15.

131
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.590
If you went to college at 19 in seminary at 22 infants PhD at

132
00:08:41.591 --> 00:08:44.230
26, extremely bright guy,

133
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.270
but he also had a vision. We think you're just the deal.

134
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:53.350
He thought the vision, if you have a thousand people and all of them are blind,

135
00:08:53.351 --> 00:08:57.660
the one that person's in charge. So vision is the deal, not just unity,

136
00:08:57.661 --> 00:08:58.494
you know.

137
00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:05.270
<v 0>Uh, I, I am, when, when Dr. King was killed, I was,</v>

138
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:10.040
I think, two years old. And you're, I mean, do you,

139
00:09:10.041 --> 00:09:12.860
do you learn about Martin Luther King at all, yet in school?

140
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.850
<v 2>Yes, actually today we watched his speech.</v>

141
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.450
I have a dream on English class today. Yes,

142
00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:26.960
[inaudible].

143
00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.210
<v 1>He was 90 yesterday. Yeah.</v>

144
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.360
I still that dream levels. Well,

145
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:37.910
actually we see the dream being realized, uh,

146
00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:43.040
it, it's not a simple dream. It sometime it seems the walls move for the back,

147
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.350
but the dream of that day was overcome the, the, uh,

148
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.220
indignant indignities I've been in that public combinations.

149
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.300
Then we got the right to vote and then he was killed.

150
00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.120
And the dream little beyond the grave,

151
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.560
April 4th is on the back. And they in Memphis,

152
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:08.120
dead on the balcony for the later Barack,

153
00:10:08.121 --> 00:10:09.260
when the back of the white house,

154
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.780
we gone from the white house in the back of the Memphis,

155
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.220
but all that sadness for the years in the wilderness for the years of struggling

156
00:10:16.221 --> 00:10:17.360
and building coalitions.

157
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.670
<v 0>You were there that day 51 years ago when he was shocked. Um,</v>

158
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:25.880
can you, can you take us back to what you remember.

159
00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:38.120
<v 1>Day before we sat in the room preparing to March and</v>

160
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:42.590
a very happy day it's seen next day,

161
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.770
we had more or less the same drill, having fun.

162
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.790
And I had a group down from Chicago. We were, they were playing music.

163
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:53.610
I was coming across the courtyard. It was,

164
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.080
was for them left at five o'clock. We left. It was around six o'clock.

165
00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:02.930
And he said, uh, uh, just, you're always late.

166
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.570
I said, doc, as you've all just said,

167
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:09.910
you don't even have on a tire and we're going to Reverend Kyle. So for dinner,

168
00:11:09.911 --> 00:11:13.490
I said, not the prerequisite eating, there's not a Tyson appetite.

169
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:18.440
And we laughed. And by the Powell, he hit him right here.

170
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.760
He asked a friend in the car with my favorite song, that precious Lord.

171
00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.530
And he raised his head and wouldn't hit him. He never, nobody.

172
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:33.890
What hit him really? I miss him very much. I miss him very much.

173
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:41.210
<v 0>Many years ago. You've been quiet. I mean,</v>

174
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.260
I don't know friendly, but do you know Donald Trump? Uh, and you've,

175
00:11:45.261 --> 00:11:49.180
you've said some nice things about him. Uh, is that something you,

176
00:11:49.181 --> 00:11:54.010
you regret or do you, do you stand by that? I said what.

177
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.370
<v 1>I saw then, but not what I see now. Uh,</v>

178
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:02.530
unfortunately, uh, he has misused his talents.

179
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.880
He's a very talented man,

180
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:09.070
but somehow he is determined the blood wouldn't go to his base.

181
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.130
You become president of the whole nation becomes your base.

182
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:18.490
So he sees the world through a keyhole and not to adore the leaders that the

183
00:12:18.491 --> 00:12:20.380
best minister of the world through a door,

184
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.280
that was a very special genes about the King. He saw the world.

185
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.370
So do it. If he was in Stockholm, uh, Sudan and Mississippi,

186
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.680
he was at home because in this world are no more foreign. As we're all family,

187
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.090
different languages have been one message of hope, healing and love.

188
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.560
<v 0>[Inaudible]. I wondered you, you try to, to become a precedent, uh,</v>

189
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.430
presidential candidate twice. Uh,

190
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.220
but you've also been close to so many precedents.

191
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.360
Do you sometimes feel the relief that you never got that far?

192
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.083
No.

193
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:15.270
[inaudible].

194
00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.030
<v 1>I'll tell you what. When I was in resurrection center with Dr. King,</v>

195
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.690
after he was killed, the King was dead and Robert Kennedy's day,

196
00:13:21.691 --> 00:13:26.280
we were depressed. So one morning a group of people that came in the rain,

197
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:31.350
looking to me to give them something. I'll say something.

198
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.230
I had no money to give them. I couldn't get them back home.

199
00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:40.080
I looked at faces and I said, you still have earth. You'll you're hungry,

200
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.110
but you're God's child and say, I am somebody.

201
00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:48.420
And then they begin to respond. I am somebody. He came out. For example,

202
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.530
repeat, say, I am.

203
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.610
<v 3>Well, I am setting up Stan, Stan, Stan,</v>

204
00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.373
myself.

205
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.170
I am somebody.

206
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:08.820
I am somebody respect me,

207
00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:14.010
protect me. Look me red and yellow,

208
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:19.770
Brown, black, and white. We're all precious in God's sight.

209
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.940
I am. Somebody's your screen.
