00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.850
<v 0>Last time I met astronauts, Jessica Marie.</v>

2
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.110
She was training for her expedition to the international space station.

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.230
Seven weightless months later,

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.310
she returned on the 17th of April to the same planet,

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.780
but a different world.

6
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.400
<v 1>Jessica. Welcome back.</v>

7
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.970
<v 0>Dude. Um, you've been now seven months in Orban.</v>

8
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.820
Is it the same Jessica that came back?

9
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:37.910
<v 2>I'm not sure.</v>

10
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.210
I think one of the biggest things that still feels a bit odd is that we've come

11
00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:44.570
back to a completely different planet. So whether or not I've changed,

12
00:00:44.571 --> 00:00:47.690
I'm not sure because everything feels completely different.

13
00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:49.340
Given the earth that I came back to.

14
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.790
<v 0>You came back, you landed on April 17th.</v>

15
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.560
That's not a little more than two weeks ago. Uh, tell that,

16
00:00:57.561 --> 00:00:59.300
tell me about that descent. How was that?

17
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.720
<v 2>It was really good, phenomenal experience.</v>

18
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.500
I've heard it described many times from my colleagues and of course we get a lot

19
00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:10.880
of training on it as well. So we feel quite prepared knowing what to expect.

20
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.260
And it was such an extraordinary experience because everything was like

21
00:01:15.261 --> 00:01:15.891
clockwork.

22
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:20.720
And it's really a Testament to how robust that Soyuz spacecraft is exactly when

23
00:01:20.721 --> 00:01:23.870
I expected things to happen. You know, cause really as the crew,

24
00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:26.450
the commander and myself and the left seat as a copilot,

25
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.730
we're monitoring everything throughout the descent.

26
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.630
If things are going nominally, as we say, if things are going well,

27
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.440
then you really don't have to take that much actual action.

28
00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:38.960
You're really monitoring things. You are sending some commands,

29
00:01:38.961 --> 00:01:42.440
but you don't have to do too much if the automatic systems are working well.

30
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.620
But of course we are trained to react to an emergency in which we do need to

31
00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:48.710
take some more action, but it was so interesting to see. I mean,

32
00:01:48.711 --> 00:01:51.920
everything was just happening, like clockwork, exactly what I expected it.

33
00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:53.780
I would be monitoring and there it was.

34
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.090
And then you could really have a sense of how dynamic everything was when you

35
00:01:59.091 --> 00:02:02.090
felt the separation of the upper, the habitation module.

36
00:02:02.091 --> 00:02:05.060
That's on the upper part that actually burns up in the atmosphere and only the

37
00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:08.630
descent module comes down. You could hear those they're pirate,

38
00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:11.900
bolts that fire in order to separate those two parts of the vehicle,

39
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.290
you could hear it and you could feel it, you know, click, click, click,

40
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.130
and inches away from my head. I'm watching the flames, you know, come past.

41
00:02:19.131 --> 00:02:23.030
And it was just a really, really incredible experience.

42
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.230
And then when the parachute opens, that is the most dynamic phase of the flight.

43
00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:29.960
And I was prepared for this because everybody had told me about it,

44
00:02:29.961 --> 00:02:33.170
but nothing can really prepare you for what it feels since it's nothing like

45
00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:36.140
anything I've ever experienced. It's not as if you're swaying,

46
00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:37.190
when the risers come out,

47
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.880
you're it's really motion and everything in every direction as the vehicle

48
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.440
stabilize, it's under the parachute.

49
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.560
So you feel as if you're in a washing machine or something, every,

50
00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:49.010
every motion you can imagine is imparted on your body.

51
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.220
And then that only lasts, lasts for a short time.

52
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.750
Then you're falling under the parachute and you're then closely monitoring

53
00:02:56.751 --> 00:03:00.610
because you want to be completely still and have all of your very tight and be

54
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:04.180
ready to brace for the impact of the landing itself. And that I had,

55
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.120
it had been described to me as feeling like a car crash.

56
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.100
Since of course you come to a sudden stop,

57
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.460
you have these soft landing thrusters, that fire, and then you hit the ground.

58
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.490
So I was prepared for a really jarring impact. You know,

59
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:19.510
we have had some experiences where crew members will even get injured because

60
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.330
they don't have their seatbelts tight enough or a limb comes out,

61
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:23.500
a knee comes out or something.

62
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.140
So I was making sure that I was really well positioned.

63
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:28.240
So I was expecting this big jarring impact.

64
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:30.460
And actually I felt like it was quite soft.

65
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.000
They call it a soft landing and then suddenly we're on the ground.

66
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:37.720
And that was just such a strange experience. You know, you're, you're in space,

67
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.810
you've been there for seven months and the suddenly you're back on the ground in

68
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:42.430
a field in the middle of Kazakhstan.

69
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.000
<v 0>I mean, you're trained for this. You, you, uh, probably won't throw it up,</v>

70
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.890
right. But I guess.

71
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.110
<v 2>It depends, you know, a lot of that is really individual. So some individuals,</v>

72
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.890
even astronauts and cosmonauts do still get quite sick and coming back because

73
00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.941
as you might imagine,

74
00:03:59.941 --> 00:04:04.650
your neuro vestibular system has become accustomed to micro gravity and here on

75
00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:05.610
earth, really our,

76
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.900
our vestibular systems have evolved and are very gravity dependent in terms of

77
00:04:09.901 --> 00:04:13.410
your stability, your spatial awareness. It's more than that. For me,

78
00:04:13.411 --> 00:04:17.010
it's just a strange feeling of everything feels so heavy.

79
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.210
Your body feels so heavy. You just feel like you're being pulled down.

80
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.990
And that, that is actually, I still feel like that a little bit,

81
00:04:24.991 --> 00:04:26.040
even a couple of weeks in,

82
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.220
I went for a run today and I'd been doing some running.

83
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.630
We have two hours of reconditioning every day with our trainers in the gym.

84
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.710
And I'd been doing some running on the alter G treadmill that we have,

85
00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:40.440
which is basically sports teams have them for rehab.

86
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.860
You have a little skirt on and it blows air up.

87
00:04:43.861 --> 00:04:47.280
So it offset some of your weight. So I've been running on that a little bit,

88
00:04:47.281 --> 00:04:52.020
but today I ran outside in the heat and Houston with my hundred percent body

89
00:04:52.021 --> 00:04:56.550
weight. And I can say it felt like about 310% body weight because you're,

90
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.200
you're just not used to that.

91
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.650
I think the motor neuron connection as well as is all altered still from

92
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.090
microgravity.

93
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.710
<v 0>Your new normal is, uh, is the, the weightless, uh,</v>

94
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:08.790
the weightless life.

95
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.990
<v 2>Yeah, at least for a little bit longer until my body kind of reintegrates.</v>

96
00:05:12.991 --> 00:05:16.740
And it's really interesting because we spend so much time exercising on orbit in

97
00:05:16.741 --> 00:05:18.870
order to maintain our bone density and muscle mass.

98
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.500
And we spent two and a half hours of our day lifting weights and then doing

99
00:05:22.501 --> 00:05:25.080
cardiovascular exercise, like running or bicycling.

100
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.320
And so you're in really good shape, better shape than when you left.

101
00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:31.350
I'm lifting way more weight than when I left. I have higher muscle mass,

102
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.980
but there's something else going on with the cardiovascular dynamic that

103
00:05:34.981 --> 00:05:37.080
running. It's a very strange thing.

104
00:05:37.081 --> 00:05:40.560
And I think it's partially the motor neuron connection as well from your brain

105
00:05:40.561 --> 00:05:43.950
because, you know, I would feel like I'm lifting my legs, but what I,

106
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.080
what I felt like I was doing in my brain didn't feel the same way in,

107
00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:50.670
in my muscle. So it's really interesting to see that transition.

108
00:05:50.671 --> 00:05:53.550
And that's the kind of thing actually running is the one thing that seems to

109
00:05:53.551 --> 00:05:54.840
take the longest to come back.

110
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.150
<v 0>It's only when you,</v>

111
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.790
when you had land and then you were in Kazakhstan,

112
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.680
how soon did the Corona situation become

113
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:07.880
reality for you?

114
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.300
<v 2>Yeah, very soon,</v>

115
00:06:10.301 --> 00:06:14.650
because as soon as the hatch was open and what happens is the search and rescue

116
00:06:14.651 --> 00:06:15.461
teams come,

117
00:06:15.461 --> 00:06:18.910
they actually open the hatch and we just kind of stay where we are and wait for

118
00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:21.040
them to come in and essentially pull us out.

119
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.370
They don't want us to overexert ourselves when we first land.

120
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.670
And it was apparent from the very moment the hatch was open because everybody

121
00:06:27.671 --> 00:06:29.110
that we saw was wearing masks.

122
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.950
<v 0>I mean, I understand that your immune system is weakened, right?</v>

123
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.210
<v 2>Yeah, that's right. That's one of the hallmarks physiologically of space flight.</v>

124
00:06:37.211 --> 00:06:40.930
We do see this dysregulation of the immune system where we have a decrease in

125
00:06:40.931 --> 00:06:44.500
our T-cells. For example, we have sometimes astronauts experience,

126
00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:47.290
reactivation of latent viruses, like the chicken pox virus.

127
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.630
There's something about the microgravity environment,

128
00:06:49.631 --> 00:06:53.770
whether it's the stress or other factors that do cause a dysregulation of the

129
00:06:53.771 --> 00:06:56.800
immune system. So they want it to be extra cautious with us,

130
00:06:56.801 --> 00:07:00.880
given the situation with COVID-19 to make sure that we didn't contract it right

131
00:07:00.881 --> 00:07:01.151
away,

132
00:07:01.151 --> 00:07:04.150
because they weren't so sure how our immune systems would be able to respond to

133
00:07:04.151 --> 00:07:07.390
it. Luckily those things actually do come up quite quickly.

134
00:07:07.391 --> 00:07:09.700
And so that's why they kept us in quarantine for a week.

135
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.870
They were monitoring parameters like our T-cells in order to see how,

136
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.330
how quickly those systems were coming back.

137
00:07:16.331 --> 00:07:18.940
And they did come back to baseline levels within a week.

138
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:22.900
<v 0>But it is it's the ISS itself.</v>

139
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.210
Is that a virus free environment? Totally.

140
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:26.681
<v 2>It is. Yeah.</v>

141
00:07:26.681 --> 00:07:30.190
We really aren't exposed to any viruses for the entire duration that we're up

142
00:07:30.191 --> 00:07:31.330
there, which is a wonderful thing.

143
00:07:31.331 --> 00:07:34.360
It was wonderful to never worry about having to get a cold or anything like

144
00:07:34.361 --> 00:07:35.380
that. You know, of course.

145
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.700
<v 0>Well, people are coming. I mean, they're, you,</v>

146
00:07:37.701 --> 00:07:40.930
you have all their El students coming, coming in while you were there. Right.

147
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:42.220
<v 2>Right. That's right.</v>

148
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.920
But one of the ways that we try to get around that is that we do have a

149
00:07:44.921 --> 00:07:49.000
quarantine period before launch. So before I launched in Kazakhstan,

150
00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:53.200
for example, we were in a quarantine for about two weeks before launch.

151
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.810
So that's what they try to always do. We do the same,

152
00:07:55.811 --> 00:07:58.900
a similar type thing in the U S to make sure that you're sending healthy

153
00:07:58.901 --> 00:07:59.734
astronauts,

154
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.620
you have that two week period to make sure that nothing's going to pop up and

155
00:08:02.621 --> 00:08:05.470
then hopefully anybody that launches won't be carrying anything up with them.

156
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.330
<v 0>Looking up at the planet from the ISS,</v>

157
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.010
everything looks, I guess, beautiful. And as it always looks,

158
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.330
and then you get these news, um, about what's happening,

159
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:22.810
uh, um, that there is a pandemic.

160
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.520
It wasn't possible for you to fully, uh,

161
00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.900
understand what was happening.

162
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:30.940
<v 2>First of all, like you say,</v>

163
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.320
I'm looking out the window and I'm seeing this earth that is equally as stunning

164
00:08:35.321 --> 00:08:37.870
and beautiful in every way as it was before that.

165
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.700
And then to be watching the news to be talking to our loved ones at home and

166
00:08:42.701 --> 00:08:44.890
seeing this whole situation unfold,

167
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.310
it was a little bit difficult for us to believe that it was happening because we

168
00:08:48.311 --> 00:08:50.860
were still very busy in the earth beneath us,

169
00:08:50.861 --> 00:08:53.290
was coming to this almost grinding hall.

170
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.070
But we were still up there doing our same job every day,

171
00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:58.980
being very busy with the experiments, with the space station, maintenance,

172
00:08:58.981 --> 00:09:00.120
everything that we were doing.

173
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:05.400
And it was very strange to think we're only three humans right now of the

174
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:07.710
7.5 billion humans on earth.

175
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.950
We are only three of us that are not affected by this right now.

176
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:14.130
So we heard the stories we saw what was happening,

177
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:16.440
but it was difficult to feel like it was reality.

178
00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:19.440
It felt a little bit surreal for us to be witnessing it up from up there.

179
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.680
<v 0>You became a part of a historic space walk.</v>

180
00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.600
The first bake is basically what you did.

181
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:31.240
You did many spaces from home to two or three, right? I did three. Yep. Yeah.

182
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.390
Uh, but the first one was historic because it was the first all female it's

183
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.673
Facebook, right?

184
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.950
<v 2>It was, yes. I mean, there have been many other women, of course,</v>

185
00:09:39.951 --> 00:09:43.430
that I'd have done spacewalks, but never two women at the same time.

186
00:09:43.431 --> 00:09:47.270
And of course it did mean a lot to a lot of people on earth.

187
00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.000
And that was something that was actually quite overwhelming for me. I,

188
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:55.130
I was really surprised by the magnitude of the response that we

189
00:09:55.131 --> 00:09:56.060
were getting from the ground.

190
00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:00.680
We received so many messages from young girls or from really any young person

191
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:04.970
with a dream or from adults as well saying how much of a difference it made to

192
00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:07.100
them and how inspired it made them. And that,

193
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.800
that the magnitude of that was certainly not lost on us.

194
00:10:09.801 --> 00:10:12.890
We felt so privileged to have that extraordinary opportunity.

195
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:18.500
<v 0>Can you, can you, even though it is, uh, an old females Bezos,</v>

196
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.460
can you take me with you?

197
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.480
<v 2>It was definitely the highlight. I would say of my mission.</v>

198
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:27.980
I look at those three spacewalks as that was something I wish I could have done

199
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:31.850
even more have we were incredibly fortunate to have done so many in expedition

200
00:10:31.851 --> 00:10:34.880
61, which was the first four months of my mission.

201
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:39.950
We did nine spacewalks in that period. And that is really much more than normal.

202
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:44.420
Normally in one mission like that you'll have zero one or maybe two spacewalks.

203
00:10:44.421 --> 00:10:48.140
And we had nine just given the circumstances. And of course, you know,

204
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.110
being one of those being the first all-female spacewalk,

205
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:55.820
and it was just such an amazing experience, something that you never forget,

206
00:10:55.821 --> 00:11:00.110
and the hatch opens and you come outside and I looked down and I could see my

207
00:11:00.111 --> 00:11:03.290
boots and then nothing else, but the earth below.

208
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:08.120
And it was just so extraordinary and seeing the views that we have from the

209
00:11:08.121 --> 00:11:10.460
space station at the window of our, of course, incredible,

210
00:11:10.461 --> 00:11:13.370
but it looked even a little bit more crisp and the colors even looked a little

211
00:11:13.371 --> 00:11:17.120
bit more intense when you're only looking through the, through the thin visor,

212
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.330
no nothing is separating you from the vacuum of space,

213
00:11:20.331 --> 00:11:21.680
except for this thin visor.

214
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.280
And you're in this mini little self-contained spacecraft of your own, really.

215
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.640
And that is just of course, a very intense experience.

216
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:30.890
I wish that during our spacewalks,

217
00:11:30.891 --> 00:11:35.300
we had more time to really just appreciate that and to look at the earth and

218
00:11:35.301 --> 00:11:36.134
look around.

219
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.040
But the truth is that we're so busy getting the task done that we need to do.

220
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.750
And it's really does.

221
00:11:41.751 --> 00:11:46.280
It's completely all consuming of your concentration and your focus because

222
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.450
it is exhausting physically and mentally in order to work in that space suit.

223
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:54.010
So very quickly you're focused on the task at hand, but.

224
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.410
<v 0>Have it, uh, I mean, did, did it all, did it all go smooth, uh, for,</v>

225
00:11:58.411 --> 00:12:00.610
for the, both of you or do you.

226
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:04.350
<v 2>It did. It did that first spacewalk. We were incredibly lucky.</v>

227
00:12:04.351 --> 00:12:05.250
Everything worked out.

228
00:12:05.251 --> 00:12:09.840
It was just one of those days where nothing went wrong and that's, you know,

229
00:12:09.841 --> 00:12:12.810
that's actually not normal. Normally there's something you didn't expect.

230
00:12:12.811 --> 00:12:15.300
And this is hardware that's left out there for years.

231
00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:17.280
So it's undergone various thermal cycles.

232
00:12:17.281 --> 00:12:21.450
So sometimes bolts don't cooperate or you don't know exactly what to expect from

233
00:12:21.451 --> 00:12:25.830
the hardware. We, everything went really, really well on that first spacewalk.

234
00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.010
What about Dale? The two, yeah, the, the other two,

235
00:12:29.011 --> 00:12:31.830
we actually did have some unexpected things happen.

236
00:12:31.831 --> 00:12:36.000
And that was really interesting for us because I think that's when your training

237
00:12:36.001 --> 00:12:39.420
really kicks in, when you have an unanticipated situation,

238
00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:43.830
you have to be able to react to it. And that we had two instances,

239
00:12:43.831 --> 00:12:47.340
one on the second space walk, there was a moment at the very,

240
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.000
towards the very beginning of the spacewalk where suddenly, you know,

241
00:12:51.001 --> 00:12:54.120
Christina and I were separated by several feet.

242
00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:59.070
And I was actually on the other side of this, of this one pallet.

243
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.820
And she suddenly said, I, you know, I think there's something wrong.

244
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.840
I think that my, my lights have become dislodged on the top of the space suit.

245
00:13:06.841 --> 00:13:10.290
We have a video camera and lights and that's not something that's supposed to

246
00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:14.670
come off outside. And so hers had become detached and I look over,

247
00:13:14.671 --> 00:13:19.230
so I make my way over to her and I see it just dangling by one

248
00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:22.320
electrical connection and it's floating away from her.

249
00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.790
And so we first attempted to try to put it back on. Um,

250
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:30.030
but it actually is impossible to do that with all the men.

251
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.460
There are some really intricate mechanisms that you need to do.

252
00:13:32.461 --> 00:13:35.730
So to be able to do that with gloved hands was actually impossible.

253
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:39.630
So what they, but what they had me do was actually detach it from that cable.

254
00:13:39.631 --> 00:13:43.890
So I did have to, you know, very carefully remove this cable. And that was,

255
00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.140
you know, obviously quite stressful, um,

256
00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.810
given this was only my second spacewalk and I'm trying to do something that

257
00:13:48.811 --> 00:13:52.620
we're not even supposed to be able to do with gloves, but we managed to do that.

258
00:13:52.621 --> 00:13:56.580
And so Christina conducted the rest of that spacewalk essentially without

259
00:13:56.581 --> 00:14:00.930
lights, which was fine in when we had the sun shining. But of course every,

260
00:14:00.931 --> 00:14:04.020
you know, 45 minutes or so. So we're in complete darkness. Uh,

261
00:14:04.021 --> 00:14:05.880
it was an interesting experience for sure.

262
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.310
<v 0>Uh, you, you, uh, you're both, uh,</v>

263
00:14:11.311 --> 00:14:14.550
Americans and Russians up there. Uh,

264
00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.220
are there any no-go topics when you,

265
00:14:17.221 --> 00:14:20.580
when you just have your evening chit chats?

266
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:22.800
<v 2>Yeah, not really. And you know,</v>

267
00:14:22.801 --> 00:14:25.140
of course we're more diverse than just Americans and Russians.

268
00:14:25.141 --> 00:14:28.230
We also had an Italian crew member on board with us,

269
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.850
and at other times during the mission,

270
00:14:29.851 --> 00:14:31.860
we have Japanese and Canadian crew members too.

271
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.270
And I think that really those sort of political issues though, of course,

272
00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.730
they're incredibly important for everybody on the ground.

273
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.790
We really don't think that way when we're in space, you know,

274
00:14:41.791 --> 00:14:45.270
we are up there operating as one crew. And I think it's easy,

275
00:14:45.271 --> 00:14:48.690
very easy for us to have that perspective when we look down on the planet and we

276
00:14:48.691 --> 00:14:53.270
don't see those geopolitical man-made and we know that we really, you know,

277
00:14:53.271 --> 00:14:57.230
it's just kind of the response that I felt when having that perspective in

278
00:14:57.231 --> 00:15:01.160
relation to COVID-19 as well. The looking down at the planet from up there,

279
00:15:01.161 --> 00:15:04.010
it is very easy for us to see that we are all in this together,

280
00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:08.120
that we really are all one humans. And I think that's how we feel as a crew.

281
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.450
You know, I, I would say, yeah, you're probably right.

282
00:15:11.451 --> 00:15:16.100
We don't directly bring up those topics about our political situations on the

283
00:15:16.101 --> 00:15:18.830
ground, but I don't think it's, you know, it's not awkward.

284
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.290
It's not really uncomfortable. We're not avoiding anything.

285
00:15:21.291 --> 00:15:24.380
It's just not really something that we're focused on. How.

286
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.090
<v 0>Much of Sweden did you bring up?</v>

287
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:30.950
<v 2>I had, uh, a really large Swedish flag. I had a, um, um,</v>

288
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:35.540
a banner from [inaudible] and I had something from Vesta Ross,

289
00:15:35.541 --> 00:15:38.990
which is where my grandmother is from where my mother was from.

290
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:43.550
And a few other things. I Pippi Longstocking book.

291
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.350
<v 0>So peppy now finally she's been in space.</v>

292
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:49.150
<v 2>Absolutely. I mean,</v>

293
00:15:49.151 --> 00:15:52.780
I think if any female we're going to be the right Swedish female to be in space

294
00:15:52.781 --> 00:15:53.740
it's pippy. Right.

295
00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:58.390
<v 0>Indeed. Absolutely. Um, do you,</v>

296
00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:03.850
I mean, do you, do you miss it, do you want to go back?

297
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.940
<v 2>Yes, I would go tomorrow if I could.</v>

298
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.630
<v 0>W w w why is that? What, what do you miss the most?</v>

299
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:12.971
<v 2>I think, you know,</v>

300
00:16:12.971 --> 00:16:17.710
what I've been saying since I came back is gravity is overrated and it is just

301
00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:18.693
this,

302
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:23.590
the feeling of floating and the views looking down at the planet and just

303
00:16:23.591 --> 00:16:25.000
being part of all of that.

304
00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:29.380
It was really so powerful and I knew it at the time.

305
00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.680
I actually did want to stay longer. Not, not everybody feels that way.

306
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.280
There are quite a few people that I would say coming to the end of their

307
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.610
approximately six month mission. They're usually ready to go back for me.

308
00:16:39.611 --> 00:16:41.680
I would have rather had a longer mission. And I think,

309
00:16:41.681 --> 00:16:45.490
especially given the situation when all of the current current situation on the

310
00:16:45.491 --> 00:16:49.450
ground was happening, of course, that made it slightly even slightly more,

311
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:54.220
less desirable to return given the situation that we're turning to after being

312
00:16:54.221 --> 00:16:57.670
in isolation for so many months, and then thinking, okay,

313
00:16:57.671 --> 00:17:01.750
now we're going to go back to earth and be in more isolation. And personally,

314
00:17:01.751 --> 00:17:05.260
I think it's much more isolating and confining down here in this present

315
00:17:05.261 --> 00:17:09.070
situation than it is on the space station, because that's, well,

316
00:17:09.071 --> 00:17:10.720
that's just part of our mission, right?

317
00:17:10.721 --> 00:17:14.770
We know there's a very good reason why we're isolated because we are in a

318
00:17:14.771 --> 00:17:17.500
spacecraft that we need a life support system for.

319
00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:20.050
We cannot survive in the vacuum of space, you know,

320
00:17:20.051 --> 00:17:23.590
without a space suit or without all of the luxuries of the space station that we

321
00:17:23.591 --> 00:17:26.860
have and because everything else is so extraordinary,

322
00:17:26.861 --> 00:17:30.160
all of the experiences that we're having are so intense, you know,

323
00:17:30.161 --> 00:17:33.370
I think that the isolation is just really part of that. You're expecting it.

324
00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:36.610
That's just part of the nominal environment now on earth,

325
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.580
our society isn't built for that, right? We're not, are we,

326
00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:43.660
we are not designed to be home alone, sitting inside,

327
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:45.580
not interacting with other humans, you know,

328
00:17:45.581 --> 00:17:49.830
not going out and experiencing the world around us. So I think that the,

329
00:17:49.831 --> 00:17:54.210
the difference there is that it's, that's just not the way our society is built.

330
00:17:54.211 --> 00:17:57.920
And so to me, it really feels much more isolated here to know that they're all,

331
00:17:57.921 --> 00:18:01.100
there are all those things that I could be doing, you know, I could be out,

332
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:05.370
you know, hiking in the forest. Uh, but I can't do those things right now.

333
00:18:05.371 --> 00:18:08.550
So I think that makes it a little bit more difficult. You have, um.

334
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:11.720
<v 0>I, I know in, in, in high school, uh,</v>

335
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:15.590
you said that your future plan was to,

336
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:20.270
to go for a space walk now that you, you did that.

337
00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.400
What, what are your future plans?

338
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.040
<v 2>I don't know. That's a good question.</v>

339
00:18:25.041 --> 00:18:28.880
I've wondered a lot about what this would feel like having fulfilled that goal

340
00:18:28.881 --> 00:18:33.500
of being in space of making those spacewalks and now, what am I going to do now?

341
00:18:33.501 --> 00:18:38.090
What's next? So I don't know. I, I think, you know, for me, of course,

342
00:18:38.091 --> 00:18:39.950
I'm really, I think it's interesting.

343
00:18:39.951 --> 00:18:42.890
I've actually thought more about when I can go back to space than I have about

344
00:18:42.891 --> 00:18:46.010
integrating into life down on earth. I,

345
00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:50.150
so the chance to go back is of course an incredible draw.

346
00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.540
And hopefully that will happen for me again at NASA. And it depends on,

347
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.051
you know,

348
00:18:54.051 --> 00:18:57.890
what I'm kind of back in line now waiting to get assigned for another mission.

349
00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.220
So it would be great to have another mission, whether that be on a,

350
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.130
on a different vehicle to the space station again,

351
00:19:04.131 --> 00:19:06.530
or maybe part of the Artemis missions,

352
00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.590
it would be an amazing experience to be part of those Artemis missions,

353
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:13.190
go into the moon. And again, that would be, that would be my choice,

354
00:19:13.191 --> 00:19:15.650
but I'm not really in control of those decisions.

355
00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:22.190
<v 0>Uh, I won't be surprised if that happens. Jessica,</v>

356
00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.870
thank you so much for taking the time.

357
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:29.840
<v 2>Well, I text them again. They are all electives. [inaudible] dog. Uh,</v>

358
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:32.540
you hope us, you hope us. Um,

359
00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:35.863
Ian's not.

360
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.640
