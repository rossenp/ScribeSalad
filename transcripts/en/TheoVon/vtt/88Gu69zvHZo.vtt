00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.130
<v 0>This week. I got a call from my good friend, Jim,</v>

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.720
and he's dealing with an issue that a lot of men are dealing with. You know,

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.330
man, don't you, you see them out there in the morning,

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.210
drink and wine beaten each other.

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.000
So like any good friend I hopped in an Uber select and went to pick him up to

6
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:18.834
see what was.

7
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.400
<v 1>There you go, man. Good, welcome.</v>

8
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.380
<v 2>So what's been going on with you? Well, yeah,</v>

9
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.080
I've been doing stand-up now for 15 years,

10
00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:32.600
for the first say 12 years.

11
00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:37.520
I did a lot of misogynistic jokes and I feel now with the good ones. Yeah,

12
00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:40.910
man. And I always thought that people understood that I was joking.

13
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:43.370
So they were in on the character.

14
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.860
But now I feel like a lot of people took them more seriously or laughing for the

15
00:00:48.861 --> 00:00:52.670
wrong reasons, but I've definitely toned it down a bit,

16
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.230
but I'd like some help with my material.

17
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.610
<v 0>Yeah. That's what I was thinking is like,</v>

18
00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:57.770
I've been dealing with a lot of the same stuff, you know,

19
00:00:57.771 --> 00:00:59.090
I don't even know what's going on anymore. Like,

20
00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:00.530
I'm almost afraid to even have a Dick.

21
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.780
<v 2>Anymore. What's wrong with your Dick? And I was just.</v>

22
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.220
<v 0>Like, it feels like I have a weapon. It's like,</v>

23
00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:08.030
I leave the house with like a knife that's made out of like Dick meters.

24
00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:11.120
You know? It's like a, not even a, it just feels dangerous. But look, man,

25
00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:14.090
I'm just as scared as anybody right now. It's like, I'm just,

26
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.740
I don't know if it's okay to be a man. I don't know if it's okay to wear it.

27
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.880
<v 2>Do you feel like being masculine is being taken away?</v>

28
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.900
I always thought that women like that, man, he takes control confidence in,

29
00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:31.760
in Sweden. Now you have to ask to change positions during sex. Oh really? Yeah.

30
00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:34.310
You go, I'm going to change position now. Are you okay with that?

31
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.900
You can't just be someone flipping my eyes. Cause then yeah. That's my move

32
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.533
is the flip.

33
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.560
<v 0>So Jim has a lot of questions about how men are supposed to act in this day and</v>

34
00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:45.980
age.

35
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.780
And especially also how we as comedians are supposed to entertain so that we

36
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.370
are not offending people like on purpose. Maybe. I don't know. That's the thing.

37
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.353
I don't know.

38
00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.500
So who better to answer our questions about the opposite sex than someone who's

39
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:02.570
both a comedian and a feminist.

40
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.420
<v 3>This is like a group of girls that I meet up with. They're like,</v>

41
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.410
bad-ass like gangsters, like independent women, like feminist,

42
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.720
but not like too hardcore. Okay. Okay.

43
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.120
Cause you guys are trying to like understand what you can say.

44
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.600
<v 2>Yeah. We were afraid to get out of the car. Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.170
<v 3>And they, they want to learn too. They want to learn from you guys.</v>

46
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.510
What you guys are sharp. Good, good.

47
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.230
<v 0>I like your body.</v>

48
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.410
So Whitney has been my friend for a long time.

49
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.790
And today she has a group meetup that Jim and I can learn from.

50
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.893
And I trust.

51
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.090
<v 3>Well, a lot of my girlfriends are trepidatious.</v>

52
00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:43.340
They feel like they can't make jokes. They don't want to offend anyone.

53
00:02:43.341 --> 00:02:46.880
They want to upset anyone. If you and I go do a spot at the comedy store, same,

54
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.210
we both do 20 minutes. Do you think we should get paid the same amount? Yes.

55
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.103
Then you're a feminist.

56
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.000
<v 2>I feel like there are feminists out there that give out other feminists a bad</v>

57
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:56.834
name.

58
00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.740
<v 3>Because there are a lot of women that think feminists,</v>

59
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:00.910
but they're actually just.

60
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.350
And we're in this climate where women can't even call out other women or people

61
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.810
freak out and you're slut-shaming and you're fighting and it's a really

62
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:11.560
unhealthy dynamic. Okay. So Theo, like what's your biggest fear?

63
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.520
<v 0>Um, probably fire mostly.</v>

64
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.800
<v 3>I mean, within the context of all the me too stuff.</v>

65
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.420
And do you feel like you are comfortable going on stage with the material we've

66
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.080
talked? Is there stuff you guys want to talk through?

67
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.240
<v 2>I did a Valentine's day joke that does the rounds every year. Uh,</v>

68
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.040
all Valentine's day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his

69
00:03:35.041 --> 00:03:37.980
head. And it's how much money do I have to spend so that you won't act like a.

70
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.170
<v 3>Yeah. But see, that's funny to me.</v>

71
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.920
Here's why that's funny to me. I don't think you're talking about me. Yeah.

72
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.350
I just go Jim dates dummy.

73
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.210
<v 2>That joke was about all women.</v>

74
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.800
<v 0>I thought that these feminists were going to be super angry.</v>

75
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.760
I thought they were going to have little like knives that were like carved out a

76
00:03:59.761 --> 00:04:04.260
bone out of man bone. But I thought that these ladies were very accepting.

77
00:04:04.261 --> 00:04:06.360
I didn't feel like that they were angry.

78
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.480
They just wanted to make sure that they were heard.

79
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.570
<v 3>And there's like two sides of the meat tube of it. For men, you can be on the,</v>

80
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.690
like on the bad guy side, which is like Harvey Weinstein and bill Cosby.

81
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.590
Or you can be like the heroes of this and like be the dudes that are like, Hey,

82
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.880
how can I support you women? What can I do that will make you feel more safe?

83
00:04:23.881 --> 00:04:26.820
Or like, what joke can I tell that will be supportive. Right?

84
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.270
<v 2>Normalize the word continent America more than probably anyone has.</v>

85
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.320
It's another swear word.

86
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.500
<v 3>Well, yeah. I mean, I have a problem with the C word.</v>

87
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.930
<v 2>Arkansas. You, you just tell me man, put up your hands,</v>

88
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.500
you do the sentence and then I'll go. And.

89
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.453
<v 3>Then.</v>

90
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.730
<v 0>Somebody puts you a dream catcher. Would you like that?</v>

91
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.030
<v 2>No. What about a God splitting the bill with you?</v>

92
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.630
<v 3>We actually offer. And I've talked about this all the time. I think you should.</v>

93
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.920
<v 2>Yeah, but they get the purse up. They're very quick to put it back away.</v>

94
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.220
<v 3>I have paid for three trips to Thailand. Oh wow.</v>

95
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.540
<v 2>That was the surgery. [inaudible].</v>

96
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.710
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, I really appreciate you guys this time. I think, you know,</v>

97
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.460
I'm not afraid to talk to feminists.

98
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.930
I feel less nervous than when I came in here, Jim.

99
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.060
I also feel less nervous.

100
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.410
These women are a lot more supportive than I thought they would be.

101
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.310
And when somebody lets you share your thoughts and really listens to those,

102
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.000
it really makes it a lot easier for you to hear theirs.

103
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.970
I want to invite you to.

104
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.110
<v 3>Feminist art show it's Ivanka or the performance artists is one</v>

105
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.860
woman shows. Yeah. We'll we'll come to it. Um, would you do a set for us?

106
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.800
Um, yeah

107
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.060
[inaudible] thank you.

108
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.710
[inaudible].

109
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.330
<v 0>Look, Jim is a very smart man.</v>

110
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.880
Probably one of the six or seven or 30,000, maybe third,

111
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.800
fifth to 18,000, a smartest man around and from this experience,

112
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:07.010
he will develop an educated perspective because that's what he does with all

113
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:09.230
experiences. And that's what good comedians do.

114
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.170
<v 3>Hi my mom. This is my,</v>

115
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.173
my choice,

116
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.600
my, my, my, my, my, my, my.

117
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.130
My is not a rap song for you to rap about skate is mine and mine only.

118
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.060
It's definitely.

119
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:32.200
<v 0>Unique environment here.</v>

120
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.060
And if you want to be in less fear of a group like feminists.

121
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.400
<v 3>Spend some time with them, not just,</v>

122
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:46.660
I scream the history of sadness so that we all can chat together.

123
00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:56.680
[inaudible].

124
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.831
<v 0>You know,</v>

125
00:06:56.831 --> 00:07:00.640
I felt honored that they invited us and I was even more surprised at how

126
00:07:00.641 --> 00:07:05.600
accepting they were of me being able to share my thoughts. Thank you.

127
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.513
We're going to give you a hug.

128
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.620
<v 3>Of course I consent.</v>

129
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.100
<v 0>So no sex.</v>

130
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.630
I tried to write a poem and I am pretty nervous. Uh, but I will do my best.

131
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.620
My Wiener is chill, man. It ain't trying to do no crime.

132
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.710
It ain't even that hard. A lot of the time. And that's true actually,

133
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:29.890
because a lot of times I'll get like those Wiener pills from the gas station.

134
00:07:29.891 --> 00:07:32.500
You know what I'm talking about them real giraffe makers, you know,

135
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:37.090
make my legs, sweat. Actually, my Wiener is trill. My Wiener is candid.

136
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.730
It looks like Joe Peshy. It's that wet bandit.

137
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.500
But I'm lit to the fact that girls are far more than sex.

138
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.370
They are champions and soldiers with power in their breasts.

139
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:52.480
They are creative and equal and warm and life bringing.

140
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.630
I love Dolly Parton, but it's because of her singing.

141
00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:02.020
My Wiener is chill, man. It ain't trying to do crime. It ain't even that hard.

142
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:06.490
A lot of the time, my Wiener ain't Weinstein. My Wiener ain't Cosby,

143
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.180
but sometimes it wishes for a little bit of a Jasmine. You feel me?

144
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.153
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

145
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.380
<v 2>Uh, poems called, uh, things I thought of today.</v>

146
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.190
Oh, I'm a main sort of, and I try to do right, like Rosario,

147
00:08:30.191 --> 00:08:34.480
Donald taking a small bite. She's a big girl. Cut.

148
00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:37.510
It's so confusing to know what to think and what to say.

149
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.880
If only I wasn't an atheist, at least I could pray. Okay.

150
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.010
Uh, I use women for sex and some have used me.

151
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:49.900
Like you seem depressed.

152
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.040
<v 3>Except you sit when you.</v>

153
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.720
<v 2>Pee and you can't spill women without men and there's no men</v>

154
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:05.070
without women. So I guess at the end of the day, we're all just pieces of.

155
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.460
So I don't dislike feminists or I don't dislike feminist.

156
00:09:14.461 --> 00:09:15.810
I just don't want to hear their poetry.

157
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.980
<v 0>There were moments that I enjoyed and there were moments that I had also fear,</v>

158
00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.110
but at least we learned something, you know.

159
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.280
<v 2>We didn't, I think I learned a little bit during the day with the group.</v>

160
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:28.150
I think they became more accepting. You became more general.

161
00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:31.400
I became more accepting and then the poetry ruined it all.

162
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.790
And now I'm back to where I started. I'll say this. I learned that they.

163
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.070
<v 0>Laugh at a lot more stuff than I thought they would.</v>

164
00:09:37.071 --> 00:09:40.940
I didn't think that they would laugh at anything, but I wasn't. I, I think they,

165
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.660
most of them were seem pretty. I don't even know.

166
00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.960
<v 2>I'm done with the hearing that sentence.</v>

167
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:53.510
<v 0>Yeah. Today was a really good day. I got to take one of my heroes into,</v>

168
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.550
you know, snatch Ghana, Stan,

169
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.750
and really see what was going on with some feminists. And in the end,

170
00:09:59.751 --> 00:10:03.770
I think we both learned some stuff. We learned that some feminists are cool.

171
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:08.750
It takes a lot of fabric and extra textiles to make one of those with Justin

172
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:13.850
and three, I really like Uber select and then I'll tip my driver the same,

173
00:10:13.851 --> 00:10:15.350
whether they're male or female.

174
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.000
<v 2>Can I have permission to hug?</v>

175
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:33.710
<v 0>Good evening, good afternoon. And other times. Thanks for watching that video.</v>

176
00:10:33.711 --> 00:10:38.420
You just saw. I mean, it was okay, but the next video you could watch,

177
00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:39.530
it could be way better.

178
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:43.040
What if you watch a video right now that changes your life where you could watch

179
00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:45.140
this one. Ah,
