00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.720
<v 0>Men are in trouble. Mansplaining men spreading me too.</v>

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.840
Time's up Takashi 69, regular six,

3
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:11.370
nine meeting up behind the Shoney's to be buddies, Jaden Smith.

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.670
Thankfully, I'm here to help now. Why am I qualified?

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.890
Cause I've got a popular podcast, a gender neutral haircut and dude,

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.670
I bought whippets off the internet. This is man up

7
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.651
[inaudible] these days,

8
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:34.950
a lot of young men don't have anywhere to turn with their struggles. I mean,

9
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:39.240
who they gonna turn to? Dude, Mr. T died. And over the last few years,

10
00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:44.040
thousands of men or women with really low voices have been calling into my

11
00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:46.650
podcast and ask them for suggestions.

12
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.860
But sometimes a phone call does doesn't get it done. You know,

13
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.470
like what pizza delivery, you can talk about it.

14
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:55.590
But until somebody shows up with the pie, you know what I'm saying?

15
00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:59.430
It's all a bunch of hearsay. But what I am trying to do is, um,

16
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.510
is just show people that somebody cares because I hate feeling like somebody

17
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:07.890
doesn't care when I need help. And um, and it's the least I can do.

18
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.140
And this week I got a call from a sugary Vixen named Jane and she's a

19
00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:15.330
single mother and she got to a boy named Ricky.

20
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.080
And he's veering heavily into adult that I'm talking to the deep end, you know,

21
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.170
and talking about this boy is getting a little bit long in the nut.

22
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.910
And she said, he's having a lot of problems. If he doesn't want to work,

23
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.150
he doesn't want to motivate. He doesn't want to contribute around the house.

24
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.510
She said some of the best things he's ever done are still alive.

25
00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:36.570
And then he S he lied to people and said that he survived. A Saint Cole

26
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.450
thing is definitely time to see how I can help this young mother with the issues

27
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:46.860
that she's having with her son. Hey, what's up? How are you? Nice to see you.

28
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.820
Nice to meet you.

29
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.590
<v 1>Oh, thank you. Why don't you come this way and I'll show you where Rick is.</v>

30
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.380
He's out back as you can see,

31
00:01:57.381 --> 00:02:02.120
he's got his vape out there and he's, that's an adult,

32
00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:04.100
huh? That's an adult.

33
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.990
<v 0>Man. When you first see Rick,</v>

34
00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:10.010
he definitely looks at the kind of guy that'll reach for your crotch and have a,

35
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.860
you know, a fresh thing, a popcorn in the other hand.

36
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.350
So what's been going on with Rick.

37
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.990
<v 1>Rick is 29 years old.</v>

38
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.820
He will sit in his room and play video games for eight

39
00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:26.150
hours in a row that hurts my heart.

40
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.280
I will ask him to finish the dishes and days and days will go by

41
00:02:31.281 --> 00:02:33.560
when the dishes don't get finished.

42
00:02:33.561 --> 00:02:36.680
And then I ended up being the one that finishes them.

43
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.870
He doesn't pay rent and losing his father at a young age, I think has had a,

44
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.910
an impact on him to what age was he? When his father passed away, he was 10.

45
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.550
I'm so sorry to hear about his dad. That makes me so sad.

46
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.530
He hasn't had that male role model type thing that shows him how to be a

47
00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:58.820
man. I'm getting ready to kick him out. I mean, look,

48
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.130
let's honest. If Rick.

49
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.790
<v 0>Doesn't get his act together, as mom's giving him the a kielbasa,</v>

50
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.000
you feel me that sign on our sausage daddy, you know,

51
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:09.190
it's time for him to just get out of the deep end of.

52
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.800
At least into the shallow into life.

53
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.510
<v 1>So yeah, dude, what the going on here, man? We know to be honest,</v>

54
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.890
it doesn't seem like you're doing your share here. Well,

55
00:03:19.891 --> 00:03:22.350
who am I hurting? I think you're hurting your mother problem.

56
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.980
<v 2>It's tough to live together. We live different lifestyles, you know,</v>

57
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.140
I'm younger. So I'm up late, you know,

58
00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:32.950
I'm playing loud music and she wants to go to bed and clean up the house and

59
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.350
I'm sleeping in late and stuff.

60
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.280
<v 1>You know, a lot of stuff she say you're doing around the house, nothing</v>

61
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.730
smoking weed. She said, you say you smoke a lot of weed. So that's nothing.

62
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.860
What else? And that's nothing. I mean,

63
00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:52.410
do you even have any hobbies that you're working on? Like a lot now or anything?

64
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.030
I have like a Lego set. Okay. So that's nothing also,

65
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.820
you know, Legos is for children and we know it is, it says on the box six to 14.

66
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.630
So when those kids see you show up, they're like, what the happened to this kid?

67
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.840
I know your father passed away. And.

68
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.940
<v 0>You know, my father passed away when I was young.</v>

69
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.900
<v 1>And I didn't know for years that I needed him to be around to tell me what to</v>

70
00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:16.800
do. You know.

71
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.210
<v 0>Sometimes when that happens,</v>

72
00:04:18.211 --> 00:04:21.360
you don't want to grow up because of the person who you want to see,

73
00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:23.880
you grow up the most isn't lot.

74
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.390
<v 1>Not anymore. Like you still have a really good opportunity in your life to,</v>

75
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.990
to care about your mother and, and be a good son. Yeah.

76
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.280
And I feel like if we have opportunity for you to help your mother out, man,

77
00:04:35.281 --> 00:04:38.880
you can, you're gonna go from being this child to being really a son.

78
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.400
<v 0>I feel like I can relate to Rick. You know,</v>

79
00:04:41.401 --> 00:04:44.940
I lost my father at a young age and from him losing his father,

80
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.270
it's just left a lot of messiness in his life.

81
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.080
And his mother has been taking care of him. You know, she's still nurturing,

82
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.530
breastfeeding, but without the breast, you know, sands, cone teat.

83
00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.390
So it's time for him to learn some skills to help her and to help himself.

84
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.420
<v 2>Hi gentlemen, welcome to Butler training.</v>

85
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.333
My name is Steve.

86
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.560
My job is to train you and to teach you how to be able to work and earn

87
00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:14.790
a living as being a Butler.

88
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.810
<v 0>Here's the thing about Butler school. Every Butler I know has their together.</v>

89
00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.640
When you see a Butler, you're like, Holy, dude, that's a Butler right now.

90
00:05:23.641 --> 00:05:26.310
Rick looks like a Renaissance. Fair escapee. You know,

91
00:05:26.311 --> 00:05:30.300
one of the hottest outfielders on an Amish women's softball squad.

92
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.400
So if we can get Rick to start doing some things,

93
00:05:32.401 --> 00:05:34.530
to help others like a Butler would,

94
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.620
then he just might start doing some things to help himself.

95
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.010
<v 2>Part of being a Butler is you have to have nice fingernails.</v>

96
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.930
Do you chew your fingernails, sir? No. No.

97
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.140
Let it look like the pinch of you to get a manicure. You have a nice haircut,

98
00:05:46.141 --> 00:05:49.710
sir. Have a nice mustache look good.

99
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.373
[inaudible].

100
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.120
<v 0>Juan is actually a buddy of mine, low key.</v>

101
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.730
We met in the elevator about maybe 11 months ago and he teaches me Spanish and I

102
00:05:58.731 --> 00:06:00.830
teach him English and Spanish.

103
00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.420
<v 2>This gentleman is handsome. This gentleman is handsome. And this gentleman,</v>

104
00:06:04.421 --> 00:06:05.800
I would say he needs some work.

105
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:11.380
<v 0>Now I actually met Butler Steve through, well. I'll be honest with you,</v>

106
00:06:11.381 --> 00:06:13.150
dude. He's a swinger.

107
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.280
<v 2>Gentlemen does the outside and the inside so that it looks perfectly clean when</v>

108
00:06:18.281 --> 00:06:19.480
it goes on the table for dinner.

109
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.730
<v 0>Okay brother. Thanks.</v>

110
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.020
<v 2>Gentlemen. I want to see a nice professional Butler fold Rick.</v>

111
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.600
He did a great job. That looks like a shirt I would wear.

112
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.980
<v 0>Oh yay.</v>

113
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.211
<v 2>Oh,</v>

114
00:06:31.211 --> 00:06:33.610
you need to help him remove the jacket because you don't want him grabbing your

115
00:06:33.611 --> 00:06:37.240
fine jacket and ripping it off your back. You look very professional.

116
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.020
<v 0>When was the last time you back in?</v>

117
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.680
<v 1>Uh, I think this is the first time I've ever vacuumed.</v>

118
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.330
<v 2>In this exercise.</v>

119
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.740
We're going to see what it's like to work with a boss that is irritated. Okay.

120
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.630
Theo. You're the angry homeowner.

121
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.420
You're going to have to stand there like a man and just take it.

122
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.790
<v 0>I'm about to light this chubby honky up.</v>

123
00:06:57.791 --> 00:07:00.820
Like he stole a sign in the Philippines in the late nineties.

124
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.780
It's time to take it up a notch and get this hairy. Chunka wag.

125
00:07:04.781 --> 00:07:06.220
You ready for the real world?

126
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.740
<v 1>Look here, boy. The fish was up. What did you cook it in?</v>

127
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.390
It wasn't even cooked. Ah, it wasn't even cooked. Boy.

128
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.120
I'm so very sorry, sir. The next fish that I cook,

129
00:07:19.121 --> 00:07:22.360
you will be absolutely perfectly. I want to cat fish.

130
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.620
I'm very sorry about the fish. We'll learn something. Get a book and learn some.

131
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.790
I'll cause I'm tired of eating bad fish around here. Hey.

132
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.550
<v 2>The homeowner would not talk to you like that because it would probably be a</v>

133
00:07:33.551 --> 00:07:34.600
lawsuit against it that way.

134
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:39.580
<v 1>Don't look at him. Boy, look here you little trucker. Okay.</v>

135
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.920
<v 2>You won't be able to use that kind of language.</v>

136
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.330
You have to speak to him and be more direct about specifically what's wrong with

137
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.193
what he did.

138
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:49.420
<v 1>Okay. You're going to get the Scarlet letter,</v>

139
00:07:49.421 --> 00:07:53.470
boy and you're ready for always fish up.

140
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.440
You know, hoard. It is for me to swallow limp,

141
00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.630
Kimberly and some of my friends in their or Remley, little.

142
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.550
You want some violent TIAA. The next creme brulee I make you, sir,

143
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.500
it will be the crispiest crunchiest kimberlé that has ever been

144
00:08:11.501 --> 00:08:14.680
seen decider crisp that up sign.

145
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.980
Or I'm going to put your bones in your. Well,

146
00:08:17.981 --> 00:08:21.130
the problem was I ran out of butane. I still away go away.

147
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.940
<v 2>Suck it in your job is to take it. You're improving. You look great.</v>

148
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.200
You look very professional.

149
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.380
I hope that this is going to help you maybe later on when you have guests come

150
00:08:32.381 --> 00:08:33.214
to your house.

151
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.660
<v 0>And buttering is pretty hard work, you know, I thought it would just be,</v>

152
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:38.351
you know,

153
00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:41.170
you kind of dress up like you're at a funeral and you just kind of steal

154
00:08:41.171 --> 00:08:45.630
silverware on the DL. But Rick is a, is making progress. And I feel like he's,

155
00:08:45.631 --> 00:08:46.510
he's getting the hang of it.

156
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.940
<v 2>Okay gentlemen. Well, he was good to start with.</v>

157
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.590
These two were very good at the beginning,

158
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.140
but this gentleman improved the most amen brother.

159
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.220
Did you think you improved it a lot today? I think I did. I came.

160
00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.330

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.670
<v 0>I think it's time new a hood. This training in new action.</v>

162
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:07.520
Let's have him Butler for someone who I barely even know.

163
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:12.020
Who's rich and judgmental and John Love it.

164
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:17.773
<v 1>Money,</v>

165
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:26.610

166
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:42.950
Hey. Oh, Theo. Good to see you. Just the Butler. That's him.

167
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:47.090
Yes, sir. What's your name? My name's Rick. Rick. Nice to meet you. How are you?

168
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.460
This isn't where I actually live. This is my it's an acting studio.

169
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.533
Anyway, come on in.

170
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.080
All right, well let's just start. Can you help me up these stairs? Okay.

171
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:08.570
Just kind of push. I ain't got to do it,

172
00:10:08.571 --> 00:10:12.920
but I'm lazy. That's all you. Thank you. All right. This way.

173
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:13.930
I think.

174
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:18.860
<v 0>Give Rick and handle Butler ring for a unique male. Like John Love it.</v>

175
00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.040
Then he'll be able to handle anything. His mother can throw at him back home.

176
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.220
<v 1>You can start with a glass of ice please.</v>

177
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:30.290
I don't hear any dishes being yeah, just staying busy.

178
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:34.970
Don't complain. I can hear you. It's a very small house. Wow.

179
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:40.400
This exceeds all expectations. Thank you very much and find my dog.

180
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:49.490
Okay. I think I found Jerry, sir. Hello? Oh.

181
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.600
Oh. Would you like me to remove Jerry sir? No, no, I liked it.

182
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.590
[inaudible] that's terrific.

183
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:15.500
You. Oh,

184
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:19.310
thank you. Uh, you can send it here. Um, you know, Theo,

185
00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:22.670
I've been a little hard on you and you've been sweating so much.

186
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.200
I don't want to watch TV,

187
00:11:24.201 --> 00:11:28.010
but you're a up and I hear everyone say how funny you are.

188
00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.540
Could you just send me your acting?

189
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:35.210
<v 0>It was a rainy night and there was a couple of bad boys looking to</v>

190
00:11:35.211 --> 00:11:38.360
get into some trouble. And before you know it,

191
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:43.460
everybody was being wild and nasty and one

192
00:11:43.461 --> 00:11:45.830
man wanted to learn how to play the

193
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:52.460
piano. But his buddies were like, you ain't playing around here. Boy,

194
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.250
is this a meeting.

195
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.480
<v 1>Theo? I'll do.</v>

196
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.130
<v 0>This. John Travolta. Impersonation.</v>

197
00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:58.683
<v 1>Okay.</v>

198
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.860
[inaudible] how long have you been at up?

199
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:08.640
<v 0>Um, about 14 years. Did you hear about Henry Winkler? 14 years.</v>

200
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:10.320
Yup. He got.

201
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:21.240
<v 1>Tough crowd by the way. The sandwich is very good. Thank you for like great.</v>

202
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:22.163
I'm glad.

203
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.380
<v 0>I think Rick has taken on some new knowledge today.</v>

204
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.380
I think he learned what it feels like to be appreciated,

205
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:32.250
what it feels like when he dresses up and takes care of his appearance,

206
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.150
you could tell, he felt good. And this is, I think the real Rick,

207
00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:41.070
this is the Rick that he wants to be. What'd you think?

208
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:45.000
<v 1>I don't know. I feel different. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

209
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:49.440
Like not just from the, the shave and haircut.

210
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:50.160
When the times got.

211
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.380
<v 0>Tough when John was losing it, when it was a lot of stress up there.</v>

212
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.130
<v 1>He didn't lose it.</v>

213
00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:57.780
I just hope that I can take some of this and

214
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.150
make my mom's life a little bit better.

215
00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:03.990
It's like she doesn't ask for a lot, you know?

216
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.290
And I feel like such a piece of that I'm.

217
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:11.880
<v 0>Yeah. We'll just love her, you know?</v>

218
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.790
<v 1>Yeah. It doesn't mean it's like all it's all you can really do is like,</v>

219
00:13:14.791 --> 00:13:18.090
just try to try better. And now that I feel like I've gotten, like you said,

220
00:13:18.091 --> 00:13:20.580
momentum, it's like something I can.

221
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:26.280
<v 0>And just keep it going. Keep it going. The rest will come. Manny will come.</v>

222
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:31.920
Oh, mom's here. Oh.

223
00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.520
<v 1>Hey, you guys look great.</v>

224
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:41.250
<v 0>He certainly looks at, I think Rick learned a lot in the past few days. I mean,</v>

225
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.100
he's going to be able to take this experience and hopefully go forth and,

226
00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.340
and let it resonate and ripple through his life in positive ways.

227
00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.400
At a certain point, we have to grow up.

228
00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:54.060
I'm learning a lot of the same things that he is, and it's hard,

229
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:58.350
but it's possible. Okay. Wow.

230
00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.820
You look so handsome. Cut all this stuff off of me.

231
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:09.510
<v 1>I'm going to take everything that I learned and I'm going to apply it</v>

232
00:14:09.511 --> 00:14:14.370
to us and I'm going to be better about the housework and stuff that

233
00:14:14.371 --> 00:14:18.000
needs to be done. And I'll be better about taking care of you.

234
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.870
<v 0>I really appreciate that. Proud of you and I love you.</v>

235
00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.480
[inaudible] good evening. Good afternoon. And other times.

236
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.320
Thanks for watching that video. You just saw. I mean, it was okay,

237
00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.710
but the next video you could watch, it could be way better.

238
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.250
What if you watch a video right now that changes your life where you could watch

239
00:14:47.251 --> 00:14:49.350
this one. Ah,
