00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.350
<v 0>Gianni here waiting for the racking to join me. You right?</v>

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.120
Racking. A lot of smack being thrown around by Mr. Grich Ang wrestling is fake.

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.110
What are your thoughts on that?

4
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.210
<v 1>Was it fake?</v>

5
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.590
When I nabbed the gab out of that little Russia Hunter,

6
00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:23.000
Mr. Michael rivalry, was it fake?

7
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:27.470
When I broke the spirit of that little Norwegian smut mannequin,

8
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.030
Mr. Crystal, was that fake? Rick?

9
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.190
Was it fake?

10
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.660
When I put the dirty you Nagi on little Bobby me

11
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.730
was that fake. Ricky,

12
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.340
the only thing not real here is you brother.

13
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.530
You little diet, denier, starch, addict, gout candidate.

14
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.530
I bet you can't even skate board.

15
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.790
<v 0>Rick had some choice words for the fans of wrestling, calling them losers,</v>

16
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.790
poor and even lowlifes. What are your thoughts on that rack? Can you think.

17
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.060
<v 1>You're better than the regular folk? Rick?</v>

18
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.580
You think you're better than wrestling fans than the regular people

19
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.990
run you out your little loose meat dinners? Well,

20
00:01:17.991 --> 00:01:20.150
I got news for you.

21
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.100
<v 0>What kind of news he is saying? Anyone can get it. Will you be the one? Right?</v>

22
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.960
<v 1>All you need to know,</v>

23
00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:31.370
Rick is that I'm ready because I'm going to give you the truth, baby.

24
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.520
And I'm going to give you the trauma name,

25
00:01:34.521 --> 00:01:37.370
the time and the place and the place and the time.

26
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.680
Cause I got a clock and a globe and an ax to grind from

27
00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:47.450
Alaska to Nebraska, from Maine to Fort Wayne.

28
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.010
It's your call? You Turkey, slicing monkey.

29
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.790
You won't know what happened when the rat King puts you in the mozzarella

30
00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:02.570
splash. You'll be here in through your feet.

31
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.790
When I put you in the Swiss wheelchair, pick your poison.

32
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.230
You Walmart buddy.

33
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.580
Kack cause I'm going to hit her with the clutter.

34
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.060
I'm not hammer with dark glamour

35
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.710
and I'm going to show you how real.

36
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.510
<v 0>There you have it. Folks.</v>

37
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.800
The racking say hello to that little side piece of yours to mistake,

38
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.420
uh, the female, not the foul. She knows who I am.

39
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.730
<v 1>He means business.</v>
