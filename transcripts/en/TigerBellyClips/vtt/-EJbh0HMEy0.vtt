00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.600
<v 0>Tiger belly or back tiger belly right now. And, uh, ask me again,</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.220
I am a people pleaser and I will tell you I'm a yes, man.

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.660
It's funny because, um, people now, um, you know, Tony,

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.640
people are moving to Texas and Austin and I'm kind of excited about

5
00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:21.540
it. I'm excited that people are moving Chavez,

6
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:24.690
ravine for life. You know, I'm going to stay here.

7
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.220
<v 1>Sense for people that aren't from LA, right?</v>

8
00:00:28.221 --> 00:00:31.430
If they came to LA for a dream or whatever,

9
00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:33.110
and certain things have changed around it,

10
00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:37.010
it makes sense that they they're jumping to another state.

11
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.940
But if you're from here and you're an Angeleno, this lives in your blood.

12
00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:43.790
I don't care if we get burned to a crisp forest.

13
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.830
<v 0>Well, I'm from San Diego, I guess I, is that LA? No. Well then I'm not, I'm not,</v>

14
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.200
uh, I'm not an Angelina then Kalila is for sure.

15
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.130
<v 1>You know, California, like for me, you know,</v>

16
00:00:55.131 --> 00:00:57.290
this was the first place I landed from the Philippines.

17
00:00:57.291 --> 00:00:59.840
And I always thought that, Oh, I could live anywhere I could live.

18
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.490
But as I'm getting older, I'm like, Holy, man, like LA is dope. I love it here.

19
00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:05.600
I don't care what anyone says.

20
00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:09.390
Any EV the perception is that like Hollywood as I LA LA and it's not,

21
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.380
it's not the kids that I grew up with. The people that I know,

22
00:01:12.381 --> 00:01:13.610
the friendships that I've made,

23
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.790
it has nothing to do with the elites of Hollywood.

24
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.920
<v 0>Yeah. I love when kids come here and they have this dream or this idea about Los</v>

25
00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:24.470
Angeles and it's usually, you know, um,

26
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.330
the perception is based on what they've seen through the media or television and

27
00:01:29.331 --> 00:01:32.210
film and whatnot. Right. But then they drive by like, you know,

28
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.220
Western and Santa Monica. Right. And they go, what the? This is not,

29
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.580
you know, that's LA to me, me too. And I love it. Yeah. I love it.

30
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.290
I love the grime of LA. I love the grind.

31
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.950
<v 1>On my weekends. Um, pre COVID I'd go to [inaudible].</v>

32
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.080
I'd eat there Saturday morning.

33
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.810
<v 0>I've also tried. I, listen, I want to say,</v>

34
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.660
I love all the cities I've ever been to. I really do.

35
00:01:53.661 --> 00:01:57.290
And there's little bits of it. Like, you know, I like the rain in Portland,

36
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.270
you know, I like just the w the trees and Austin, for some reason,

37
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:07.070
I just kinda like that, you know? And I like, um, the flatness of Idaho.

38
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.380
So that was a stretch of Brown. I love the beautiful flatness of Idaho.

39
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.550
Have you been to Idaho?

40
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.580
<v 1>I know as well, Jessica went to Idaho like two years ago and she was like, dude,</v>

41
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.290
it is beautiful.

42
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.830
<v 0>Now, maybe not Idaho. I'm talking about, um, whereas wise guys,</v>

43
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.300
what are you talking about? Omaha, Omaha, Omaha.

44
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.580
That's the most boring state to drive through Omaha, Nebraska. It's pretty flat.

45
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.900
Oh, it's just corn for five hours. But you know, you have these, you know,

46
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.410
ideas about, especially when you go to a red state and you think yourself,

47
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.290
like my brother always goes, Bob,

48
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.450
it's Texas scary, because it's like a lot of white people with cowboy hats.

49
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:54.230
It's like, no, dude. That's what like international people think of America.

50
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.220
I know it's like the opposite of that. It's Asian home too. I know.

51
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.490
It's like so fun. And the people are,

52
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:05.350
so the best audiences I've ever played for is in Texas.

53
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.360
The most wild, you know, there's strip clubs are wild, baby.

54
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.100
You know, I love myself some Texas. And you know, when you look at, you know,

55
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.660
like a political map, you know, it's red or whatever, it's like,

56
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.760
I don't visit those areas. Right. But in the cities, man, it's great.

57
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:28.300
But, um, but throughout all my travels, um,

58
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.550
I still miss LA everywhere I go, even Hawaii, I was just in Hawaii,

59
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.073
which is, um.

60
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.990
<v 2>Hey, what's up.</v>

61
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.400
