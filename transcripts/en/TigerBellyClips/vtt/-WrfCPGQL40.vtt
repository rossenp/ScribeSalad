1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.400
<v 0>Uh, we also saw something the other day that I really liked.</v>

2
00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:06.000
I cried and it's my beautiful octopus to lover. What's it called?

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.290
<v 1>Oh, then my octopus teacher.</v>

4
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.350
<v 0>Teacher, my guy who see it, no with my Lord.</v>

5
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.950
<v 1>I don't know if it will hit people a certain way or maybe the way,</v>

6
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.480
the way it hit me was like a dump truck. It hit me in ways. I don't,

7
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.100
I didn't think was sure.

8
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.370
<v 0>It was such a about it. She's like, you know, you're just not,</v>

9
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.130
you're not the type to cry over stuff like this. You don't have feelings.

10
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.030
And I'm like, what? I'm a feeler baby. Right.

11
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.960
And I saw it and it was very emotional and I,

12
00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:40.610
and I vowed today publicly that I will never eat

13
00:00:40.611 --> 00:00:44.960
calamari or octopus again. Interesting.

14
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.820
Never again. I can't cuddle fish. Yes. Eat the out of cuddles.

15
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.620
<v 1>It's just the same, babe. Cuddle fish are just as intelligent and sentience.</v>

16
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.070
<v 0>Does that have a Netflix special that they don't have?</v>

17
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.680
<v 1>What are your favorite animals of all time to eat?</v>

18
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.800
<v 0>No, but can we talk about the thing and I'll get into that. Okay.</v>

19
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.730
I don't know what it's about. Yeah.

20
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.970
I'll tell you what it's about some South African man, right?

21
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.770
He has a midlife crisis. Okay. And I guess he's, I'm involved in, um, he's uh,

22
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.720
either a director or a videographer. He produces like documentarian or whatever.

23
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.060
And he does animal. How you call it with, say a chart documentarian. And he, he,

24
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.180
he has a midlife crisis. It's the work is too overwhelming.

25
00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:29.510
So he decides just to it all and take a break.

26
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.370
So he moves back to the beach house that he grew up in with his family,

27
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.940
right. Something like that, something like that. It's in South Africa,

28
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.270
it's right on the low. And he decides to, um,

29
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.400
swim every day, right. In the, um, tip of South Africa.

30
00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:48.380
And this is the Cove. And, um,

31
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.030
he starts documenting things with his cameras and he doesn't do it with a scuba

32
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.340
Deere D gear. Oh wow. Yeah. And one day he, um,

33
00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.930
spots a, um,

34
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.370
an octopus and he goes back

35
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.820
and obviously the, at first the octopus, like what the?

36
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.600
I've never seen a white dude in my life that, what is he doing here?

37
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.520
<v 1>So he builds this. He builds,</v>

38
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.990
he builds an obsession for this 200 meter plot of

39
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.600
underwater real estate, basically.

40
00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:23.120
And so he builds an obsession and he goes to this,

41
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.800
this same little Cove every day for like 350 days.

42
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.700
<v 0>Then what happens is this octopus obviously is frightened by this.</v>

43
00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:36.650
You know what I mean? Initially, initially, and then they develop a friendship.

44
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.730
What? Yeah,

45
00:02:37.731 --> 00:02:42.680
it's really sad to the point where the octopus will throw

46
00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:47.570
out her technical arm and wrap it around his finger to say hello,

47
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.910
or the octopus follows him. She follows him.

48
00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:54.500
The octopus will come and land on his chest and greet them. Hello.

49
00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.430
So sad, you know? And, um, there's so much drama. I don't want to get away,

50
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.750
give it away and no stroller. It's a very dramatic it's so well shot. So, well.

51
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.980
<v 1>If you're just a lover of nature,</v>

52
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.160
like even before the octopus story was introduced,

53
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.840
the moment he described, like, um, being underwater,

54
00:03:15.841 --> 00:03:17.670
like flying, I was already crying.

55
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.830
<v 0>Yeah. It it's, it's one of those, um, movies where you,</v>

56
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.710
I think I there's, some people, you know, that aren't animal people.

57
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.720
Like for me, you know, when I look at my dogs or my cats in the eyes, right.

58
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.100
There's a definite connection I have, I know there's a comedy podcast,

59
00:03:38.101 --> 00:03:40.470
but I want to get real for a second, you know?

60
00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.810
And I literally love them right. More than I love most humans.

61
00:03:45.811 --> 00:03:49.140
Like I there's like a spiritual connection that I have, you know,

62
00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:52.950
when I see any of my dog's eyes and we connect in that way,

63
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.320
it fills me with such warmth and enjoy. And it, it gives me, um,

64
00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.290
a reason to live well, actually, you know, and it's like,

65
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.720
I can understand how a man, you know what I mean?

66
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.670
We'll go underwater and bond and connect with another creature in

67
00:04:08.671 --> 00:04:10.320
that way. Especially in an intelligent,

68
00:04:10.321 --> 00:04:14.940
they say that an octopus is as smart as a dog, as a primate. Yeah.

69
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.950
Right. So, um, you know, when you see like plankton,

70
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.340
them, you know what I mean? I'll eat the out.

71
00:04:23.341 --> 00:04:25.970
Like a blue whale eat thousands of them. Right. But you know,

72
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.000
when it gets to a certain intellect, a point of intellect, you know,

73
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.650
in an animal, like a dolphin or something like that. Right.

74
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.630
And you can connect and they recognize and all that stuff.

75
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.100
I just think that you can't kill them.

76
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.300
<v 1>That's tricky though,</v>

77
00:04:39.301 --> 00:04:44.070
because intellect is still defined by what we think intellect

78
00:04:44.071 --> 00:04:46.680
is. But you know, something that sent the end and something,

79
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.270
so many things that aren't even animals have like a true intelligence to them.

80
00:04:51.271 --> 00:04:53.790
Just like, like, like mushrooms and stuff.

81
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.550
<v 0>Well then we'll stop eating mushrooms. I mean, what the you say?</v>

82
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.930
You know what I mean? I can up a mushroom, loves the mushrooms, man.

83
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.870
<v 1>Dang. Like, you know, there, everything has, it's really like true it.</v>

84
00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:08.040
Everything is so important. All living things.

85
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.320
<v 0>Yes. Again, I guess I got to eat some time I've got to eat something.</v>

86
00:05:13.321 --> 00:05:17.390
Right. He's hungry. It's soy something that's living. It's all you eat is tofu.

87
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.550
Sure. There are people who would argue. Yeah. So like, if they,

88
00:05:20.551 --> 00:05:21.750
you can make an argument with that,

89
00:05:21.751 --> 00:05:24.550
that you can make an argument with anything that we eat, like Serratia, like

90
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.460
you mean it's Saracho alive at one point, maybe, you know,

91
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.170
or Tabasco you, yeah. Pepper. It's a pepper, right? Yeah.

92
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.590
Peppers were alive from a plant. Right. You can eat it. You can't,

93
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.680
you can eat it. You know? So it's like, you know,

94
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.870
you got to draw the line somewhere, sweetie. Right.

95
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.980
And I draw the lines out of octopuses. That's why, when you see stuff like,

96
00:05:46.981 --> 00:05:51.480
you know, the Ulan dogging and eating festival, it's an outrage, you know,

97
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.950
just because, um,

98
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.100
and I never thought that I know it's so weird because I used hate dogs and

99
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:01.580
cats and all animals. You didn't hate them. You just didn't know.

100
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.860
I honestly like when my friends don't talk about

101
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.700
things, you, you know what I mean? I thought you would talk about hurting one.

102
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.210
No, no, never hurt one, but like that's hating to me, my friend.
