1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.190
<v 0>Cause I remember Rebecca and your kids were on state. Like went on,</v>

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.630
you know, when, if celebrating and I remember feeling, I don't really, like,

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.190
I don't have a photographic memory,

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.200
but the sense that I got was I remember going, Oh, he's got a great family.

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.440
<v 1>I really honestly the joy.</v>

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.700
<v 0>In the, your kids, you know, face and just the joy that we felt watching.</v>

7
00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:25.860
It was just the, uh, memorable.

8
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.740
<v 2>Let's back up a second.</v>

9
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.150
You have a very clear recollection of that fight night.

10
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.620
<v 1>I know. I don't have video.</v>

11
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.450
<v 2>We have video footage of you reacting to this thing, winning.</v>

12
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.180
<v 1>I need this, I need this. I will look for it, but you keep, keep going. Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.340
Okay. Sit down, Bobby, relax. This is going to be really awkward.

14
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.550
Of course, fields in between you and me. Don't worry. I'm retired.

15
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.650
<v 2>Sit down. This is going to get really awkward for you. Okay. So we had,</v>

16
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.110
we had our entire family over and your brother and I,

17
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.520
you were acting like the Oracle.

18
00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:08.630
You said there was not a chance in hell that he could ever.

19
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.470
<v 1>Or anyone, this wire won't give him a picture of the company.</v>

20
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.040
<v 2>Remember this? And then your brother and I, and Gilbert, we said, I wouldn't,</v>

21
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.840
I wouldn't speak so fast. We had you man, the whole night we had you. We had,

22
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.190
and then he knocks him out and you

23
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.680
ran to three different bedrooms.

24
00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:37.190
Came back with your tail between your legs and you were in total disbelief.

25
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.830
Do you remember that? You said there was not a chance in.

26
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.310
<v 1>I thought we were right there, bud.</v>

27
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.740
I don't recall the words. I don't recall it like we're brothers now

28
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.310
I'll say the video. We'll post this right here we go. Oh, here we go.

29
00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.310
Wait, hold on. Rewind it, rewind it. Remind it, rewind it.

30
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.130
It's just going to embarrass me. I had a thousand,

31
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.960
a thousand dollars in Luke. Rockhold

32
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.400
[inaudible]. Wow. Gilbert and I hope you're excited.

33
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.730
Well, thank you very much, everybody. That's showing excitement. I apologize.

34
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.250
The one person is disappointed.

35
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.890
[inaudible] be honest. Be honest, be honest.

36
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.490
You guys recreated this recently.

37
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.990
You knew it was COVID you thought let's play a thousand, 16 and 14. Well,

38
00:02:56.991 --> 00:03:01.660
that's great. Thank you. Well with this guy, of course,

39
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:05.050
I got a suspicious bind. Cause he's from San Diego. Here's here's the thing,

40
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.453
right?

41
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.620
<v 0>That's regroup. Yeah. Okay. We watch every fight.</v>

42
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.920
We've watched every one of your fights. Okay. That's that's number one.

43
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.300
Have a hard one for a long time. Okay. I know, but we did. Right.

44
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.680
And I have to be honest with you. Okay. That was very real. I'll tell you why,

45
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.700
because Luke Rockhold is from Santa Cruz or whatever. Right.

46
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.540
And he skateboards I'm from San Diego. Right? So I feel like.

47
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.810
<v 1>He's like your skateboard I used to, right? No,</v>

48
00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:36.540
I was going to say so he's from Santa Cruz. You're from San Diego. No.

49
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.553
Where near each other.

50
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.690
[inaudible] you guys are boys and you could

51
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.090
[inaudible] that's true on the podcast. How many times this, Michael,

52
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.320
let me ask you this. How many times does Luke face? Rochel done my podcast.

53
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.910
None ask him. All right. All right. So that's number two.

54
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.890
True number. And also I'm sweating. Here's the second thing. Okay. Is this that?

55
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.010
Sure. 2016, right? Right.

56
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.050
<v 0>It was the night where I laid down in bed and I became a Michael Bisbing fan.</v>

57
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.330
<v 1>All right. Yes. Yes. All right. I watched your season of the ultimate Sam.</v>

58
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.410
<v 0>I didn't even know what that was. Okay. You were a little behind.</v>

59
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.100
I was a little behind. So what I'm saying is, is that okay? Yeah. At the time.

60
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.100
<v 1>That's a real man. That's a real up. Shut the up everybody. All right.</v>

61
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.870
<v 0>At the time. Right.</v>

62
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.160
I was rooting for Luke Rockhold and at the time when you open your eyes,

63
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.200
I am opening my eyes. I mean, you face.

64
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.100
<v 1>Right? Yeah. This is why it is the go. Right.</v>

65
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.900
<v 0>Right. And, um, and at the time I was rooting for him. And when he,</v>

66
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.570
you knocked him out, it was such a shock to my system.

67
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.460
But then I was reborn like a Phoenix. Wow. And I, and I,

68
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.480
and I wasn't convinced from that day forward, right.

69
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.100
That you were the guy. Okay.

70
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.970
<v 1>When you hear that.</v>

71
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.350
<v 0>I wanted him to win.</v>

72
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.510
<v 1>I want my glee. No. Well, come on, everybody likes George. Let's be honest.</v>

73
00:05:18.511 --> 00:05:19.344
He's a sweetheart.

74
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.720
<v 0>See, here's the thing. When I met Khalilah,</v>

75
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.070
I had stopped watching UFC for a long time.

76
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.850
<v 1>A long time. I couldn't even, I couldn't. Yeah. And so.</v>

77
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.950
<v 0>The George St. Pierre years,</v>

78
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.780
I was in Houston when he lost a max Serra, Matt Serra.

79
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.540
Cause I was the Jordan Peele, you know who directed get out. Yes.

80
00:05:42.541 --> 00:05:46.980
So the UFC for one night hired me and Jordan Peele to do some sort of

81
00:05:46.981 --> 00:05:50.400
comedy thing at some red carpet event for them. Right.

82
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.630
And they never asked us again,

83
00:05:51.631 --> 00:05:56.310
but it was me and Jordan were in Houston when we saw George St. Pierre,

84
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.700
Lucy met Sarah. And I remember everyone was shocked and I was so like,

85
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.780
not involved that I didn't even know that that was a big deal. Right.

86
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:07.700
It's when I met her on Tinder.

87
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.283
<v 1>Testing, do you always have.</v>

88
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.230
<v 0>And she was a big fan. I slowly got back into the UFC. Right.</v>

89
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.080
So for me, you know, I wasn't a George Sr.

90
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.560
<v 1>Okay. Okay. Hold on. Let me, let me just stop you right there.</v>

91
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.600
I'm going to give you some advice. Probably. I don't need advice. Well, I'm,

92
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.710
I'm going to give you some and you're going to hear this. You're going to go.

93
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.970
Oh, interesting. Yeah. I'll take that on board next time. You're with a fighter.

94
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.890
Right. And you know,

95
00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:37.540
you're clearly making my fighting ability, the,

96
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.130
the conversation piece. And you talk about a former opponent of mine.

97
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.230
Don't intro the conversation about the opponent who beat me by saying,

98
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.650
Oh yeah. I remember watching him get his kicked one time.

99
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.270
And then he went on to beat

100
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.100
[inaudible] you're right. You're wrong. I mean, just say, wow.

101
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.220
The greatest of all time, Joe tip yet he was unstoppable.

102
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.050
That would have been better. I remember when he got his asking

103
00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.890
[inaudible] I always saw that as a fluke. Wasn't it like? Oh, no. He caught him.

104
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.010
<v 0>Okay. So I want to say this. Okay. Kind of fluky,</v>

105
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.480
but I did not go to journalism school. Okay. All right.

106
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.930
I've never went to college. Okay. I'm just telling you that.

107
00:07:34.931 --> 00:07:39.460
I'm just like this little weird Korean fella. You know what I mean? In 1995,

108
00:07:39.461 --> 00:07:43.990
I walked by a comedy club and I signed up for an amateur night. I have no,

109
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:48.010
is that true? Yeah. I have no skills whatsoever. And I went up,

110
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.400
I don't know anything. Right. So, um,

111
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:55.930
in terms of talking to people and being a journalist or interviewer,

112
00:07:55.931 --> 00:07:59.050
I don't know what I'm doing. You don't need to be. I know my point, my point is,

113
00:07:59.051 --> 00:08:03.490
is that, you know, um, I think that, um, you know, I apologize.

114
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:09.130
<v 1>It's okay. I don't, I don't, I want to make you a better person.</v>

115
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:13.990
<v 0>I know. I want to do it. I'm trying to, I want to learn. Okay. I it up.</v>

116
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.400
Right. Because I up. Right. I up the Luke Rockhold thing. Right.

117
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:23.620
And I up the George St. Pierre thing. Right. And I'm learning as I go. Okay.

118
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:28.720
And I apologize. Okay. I apology this salt necessary. Okay.

119
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.840
Let's talk about fully accepted. Let's talk about Saturday again. Okay.

120
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.640
So do you think that.
