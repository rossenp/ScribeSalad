00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.860
<v 0>[Inaudible] Oh my God. I know a lot of songs,</v>

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.380
but don't ask me singing, you know? Yeah. Well, I'm sorry, mom.

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.010
I love you so much. And I, um, in a heartbeat, no, no,

4
00:00:13.011 --> 00:00:16.130
I'm just in general. I just feel sorry for what we're going through,

5
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.050
but every whole family going through the same thing. Right?

6
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.030
I don't think I'm processing it right though. No,

7
00:00:23.031 --> 00:00:27.050
you are a little bit late and I mean, you are going slow.

8
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.371
Like a Steven.

9
00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:32.630
I will look in eyes and then we started crying.

10
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.030
Even now we starting looking eyes and if I like watery

11
00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:42.350
eyes, he started crying, but he never, so his emotions, you know,

12
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.460
don't bottle it up. You gotta get it out. I, I honestly,

13
00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:50.150
I don't know what's going on. I, uh, I think about it every night. I think I,

14
00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:54.600
and I, I sit, I'll sit down at the edge of the bed and analyze like, what,

15
00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:58.010
what am I feeling? What is, why am I? And I just don't know.

16
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.160
I've never been here before. I don't know how to feel.

17
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.540
I don't know how to that's my first husband. I lost.

18
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.650
So how do I fear? I didn't know. That's why, you know,

19
00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:11.240
right after his death,

20
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.430
I was the cry because I didn't expect it that, you know, I thought I,

21
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.760
he, I realized he never gonna come back to me.

22
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.530
You know? That's how we go through it together. Yeah.

23
00:01:27.531 --> 00:01:31.160
It's been hard. Yeah. Well, I mean, we had the up and downs, you know,

24
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.870
one time I hate him. I'm going to divorce him after his kids are growing up,

25
00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:40.040
you know, but then you guys growing up. Wow.

26
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.830
He treated me so nicely.

27
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.270
So I just didn't divorce him and we'll live up to here, you know? Yeah. Yeah.

28
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.340
I mean, I think that, um, when we, the kids moved out of the house,

29
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.800
it got better for my mom because he relaxed more pressure.

30
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.610
The pressure. Yeah. Or I do, you know, all the education I did.

31
00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:05.430
He didn't do nothing. He just making money. Yeah.

32
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.910
But everything has to my even moving, I have to pack everything,

33
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.320
even little items. He just come in a new house.

34
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.010
They had low, you know, that's what I did for them. That's what she's doing now.

35
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.820
[inaudible] yeah. Get it done, babe. Get it done.

36
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.300
Cause I, my tolerance went away.

37
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.380
Yeah. Every time I get to my job and raising kids today,

38
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.800
that's my eyes up. Could in the house. That's my job. No,

39
00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:46.160
I hired the cleaning lady, but then,

40
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.230
but I got to watch her to do it, you know? Uh,

41
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.720
and he never even [inaudible], you know,

42
00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.000
critical activities because I follow them, you know, like, uh,

43
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.820
tennis Kennison and soccer's and soap the boar

44
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.750
and even wrestling. We never played softball.

45
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.810
We never played softball mom one day and,

46
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.290
and Oh yeah. That's a big thing.

47
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.840
I love you. That was weird. You guys bonded as a nice,

48
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.240
because I look like him. I watched his movie like 10 years ago.

49
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.663
Yeah. Yeah.

50
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.680
I wonder if I want to say this mom that I guarantee you,

51
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.150
that, that guy

52
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.790
just saying that guy is this guy maybe

53
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.550
twice or twice as, also in the future. I think he's only,

54
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.140
are you in your twenties? 30. 30? Yeah.

55
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.350
Maybe we might have to show him my mom, the video.

56
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.840
[inaudible] I just want to show her what she'll be.

57
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.470
She'll be disappointed in me. I wasn't scared. I wasn't scared to be really fat.

58
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.900
This used to be really fast.

59
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.740
There's a video of him saying yeah,

60
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.150
by looking at it when you wait, it's a lot heavier,

61
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.330
um, uh, uh, having a once a day. Yeah. Yeah.

62
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.890
So I have a lot intermittent fasting. Wow. Your body's kind of squarish now.

63
00:04:28.891 --> 00:04:33.240
It's weird. Good or bad. It's like SpongeBob, like yellow flourish.

64
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.260
That's good. I know.

65
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.870
I know. That's what I thought.

66
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.160
Curves curve. I know.
