00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.610
<v 0>And Esther is a, I mean, I'm going to say this.</v>

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:07.110
I like to give people props where they deserve it. You, I,

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.063
I'm going to be honest with you.

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.880
There is been no one like you in the stand-up comedy world.

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.020
I don't know if that's a good thing, but,

6
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.480
but there has been no one like you in the 20 years that I've been doing.

7
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.370
<v 1>You know what, even from an outsider's perspective, you have a very,</v>

8
00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:27.110
very specific and particular voice and look and overall

9
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.160
image compared to anyone else. And I think that's, you know,

10
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.100
such a great advantage for you just cause you're odd. You're all, you're

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.490
like Jeffrey Dahmer. You're not Jeffrey.

12
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.070
<v 0>You're more like, no, you're like.</v>

13
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.900
<v 1>Andrew Cunanan. He's half Filipino.</v>

14
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.200
<v 0>You know, like back in the day when they starting the circus.</v>

15
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.680
<v 1>Yeah. [inaudible].</v>

16
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.400
<v 0>But I also want to say that you're young and you know why also I love you is</v>

17
00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:06.020
that we're, you're very neurotic. Like I am, you get diarrhea all the time.

18
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.600
Her boyfriend does. Yeah.

19
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.850
<v 1>Oh my God. Don't say that. I'm the opposite. I get constipated. Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.600
<v 0>Oh really? Yeah. Cause he told me once your boyfriend, I don't care.</v>

21
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.300
He told me what's a, he takes, um, what's that 80 before meals just in case.

22
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.740
It makes me imagine taking him on every meal.

23
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.590
And just in case you're going to get diarrhea. It's living life in a prison.

24
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.150
No he's being safe.

25
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.780
<v 1>It's like putting a cork in it so that it never condoms.</v>

26
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.050
But like he should address what is the problem? Really IBS.

27
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.440
If it just goes through him each time, speaking of what is the problem,

28
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.440
Khalilah, maybe you should come over. Maybe I should ask her.

29
00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:47.000
Our relationship is very strange.

30
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.060
<v 0>Khalilah is a nurse. It's.</v>

31
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.600
<v 1>Strictly a nurse patient relationship. If you go through the whole,</v>

32
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.490
the history of our text messages,

33
00:01:55.491 --> 00:02:00.080
it's just a bunch of pictures of Esther's rashes. The inside of her mouth.

34
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.890
Like her tonsils, her CT scan.

35
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.250
<v 0>I stopped watching photos. I mean, it's like, I gotta go. I don't wanna,</v>

36
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.600
I don't, I don't want to deal with it. Yeah.

37
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.340
<v 1>Well text me from New Zealand. I think I'm dying. What do I have? God</v>

38
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.440
rashes. Do you get, I get all sorts of rashes. I, well,

39
00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:21.830
when I was in New Zealand, I had a swollen lymph node.

40
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.030
Carlisle has helped me so much. Like I,

41
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.730
I don't even know where to start, but there's so many, like,

42
00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:32.240
she's just so good and the liable, but I keep coming back,

43
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.420
like knowing her as me and my life significantly better. Oh, that's really nice.

44
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.220
You're you're a touch hypochondriacal but I think, you know that I do. I do.

45
00:02:43.221 --> 00:02:46.580
And I feel like I'm very aware when I'm texting you. Like, I'm like,

46
00:02:46.581 --> 00:02:50.420
I know this is crazy. Yeah. Hopefully I say that. And when I,

47
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.270
when I was switching over phones and I was like, Hey, like, sorry,

48
00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:56.000
I didn't reply back your phone. My phone's broken. She was like, okay,

49
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:59.710
make sure you have a phone soon, a new phone soon.

50
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:04.420
Like it was a legit concern for her just in case like a new rash, you know,

51
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:05.080
sprouts up.
