1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.920
<v 0>That's what, when I first met you,</v>

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.250
that's what I got from you have a really good childhood.

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.570
I think it's unbelievable. It's unbelievable. My bonds are incredible.

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.800
My parents are absolutely.

5
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.710
<v 1>Very actualized and you really have a lot of the things that neither here I have</v>

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.770
act like you, you,

7
00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:22.190
you can get there and you can rally for yourself and you have that belief in

8
00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:26.330
your own power. We're we're spineless little, um, um,

9
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.640
kind of scared of our own. Um.

10
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.330
<v 0>Or they say, I don't believe that the worst finally schools,</v>

11
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.810
I don't believe that you guys don't believe in your power.

12
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.250
<v 1>No came. Cause we got beat so much as children.</v>

13
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.830
It's like every, you know,

14
00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:47.630
we never really were rewarded for even anything.

15
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.350
<v 0>Yeah. Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.</v>

16
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.510
Because how can you become so successful? What is it?

17
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.460
Or do you not recognize your own success?

18
00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.200
<v 1>Unless there's, I, I have a perfectionist, a perfectionist kind of head.</v>

19
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.760
I won't even try if I don't know. The result is absolute perfection. Yep.

20
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.590
Because it's not like there's any reward to be had because I just was never

21
00:01:09.591 --> 00:01:11.450
rewarded unless it was exactly what my.

22
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.860
<v 0>And then that's crippling. Right.</v>

23
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.100
Cause then you don't try to do certain things because you might end up here.

24
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.010
<v 1>Yeah. So eventually you just become paralyzed with all these,</v>

25
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:22.820
like an abundance of ideas. You'll never ever even pull the trigger on.

26
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.190
<v 0>No, that is interesting about it now,</v>

27
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:28.700
but we're but that's why I have tasted success. Yeah. And I'd be like,

28
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.720
I look at a guy like you though. And I go, um, cause we really are fond of you.

29
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.830
I love it. Thank you. I love it. I love you. I mean, I love you, but I know,

30
00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:41.360
I know. But as soon as I met you, I was, I was fond of you and I think,

31
00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:44.570
you know, rogue and all these people with you too. Right. It's just like,

32
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.860
you know, you're able to now do bi-coastal, right? Yeah. You guys,

33
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.780
you guys have embraced me more than the New York scene has embraced me. Wow.

34
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.870
Really a hundred percent West coast embraced me way before in New York.

35
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.020
That's so strange. Um,

36
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.210
I kind of like carved my own path in New York.

37
00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:04.910
Like I didn't like do like the traditional, like, uh,

38
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.660
I wasn't like hitting the mix with a lot of people and I wasn't like for lack of

39
00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:09.351
a better term,

40
00:02:09.351 --> 00:02:13.160
like really kind of like hanging around maybe the seller and like, um,

41
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.880
I don't want to say kissing of the OGs, but like, uh,

42
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.010
I just didn't feel like that was the best use of my time.

43
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.800
Like I thought the best use of my time was like getting on stage as much as I

44
00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:24.980
possibly could and being as funny as I possibly could, you know?

45
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.390
And like that's what my main focus was. And I,

46
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.320
I wasn't like trying to like cozy up to anybody to like open for them.

47
00:02:30.321 --> 00:02:33.890
And maybe that was interpreted as like not, you know,

48
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.680
paying the respect or something like that, but that's never what it was.

49
00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:39.140
There's just like, I know what the I want to do. And I know how to get,

50
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.810
I can get better at comedy by working on comedy,

51
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.550
not by telling this comic how amazing his set was. Does that make sense? Yeah,

52
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.620
but I, but you know, for me, um, my opinion about somebody is,

53
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.490
you know, I look at the work. Hmm. Okay. So it's like, you know, when I,

54
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.440
I remember when I first met you, I don't know if I said this is the last time,

55
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.540
but I didn't know who the you were. Right? Yeah.

56
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.480
I had heard your name because I knew that you were on the list.

57
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.950
Cause we're doing that show together. Yeah.

58
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.750
But it couldn't put a name to the face.

59
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.580
So you were leaning against this like pole, right. And you go, Hey, I'm Andrew.

60
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.770
And what I wanted to say, I didn't say it. I don't give a. Right.

61
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.830
That's what I wanted to say. But I go like, Oh,

62
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.010
nice to meet you Andrew or whatever, this white guy. Right.

63
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.230
But as soon as you know what I mean, he, he, I saw him perform right there.

64
00:03:29.231 --> 00:03:32.710
It's the same feeling that I had when I saw Patrice for the first time. Oh,

65
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.680
that's the biggest compliment where I went, Oh.

66
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.930
That's real. Right. He could be the biggest piece of. You know? I mean,

67
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.450
hopefully I could be his friend. He was a piece of. I can't be his friend.

68
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:46.630
Right. But then the, he turned out to be a really nice guy as well. Right.

69
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.460
But it's like, I just look at the work. Right.

70
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:51.370
I don't know about the history or how you got there. You know,

71
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.140
I look at what I see on stage and I go, Oh, that's high level.

72
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.880
Right. Yeah. And so, um, that's how I, you know, that's how we've,

73
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.840
that's how I know you. Right, right. From, from the work and that's the best.

74
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.780
Yeah. You know, and, and now, you know what I mean?

75
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.010
You're also a great podcaster and we, we have a good relationship, but um,

76
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.670
you know, I really do, you know, you're a young kid. I want to hurt you.

77
00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:18.460
Sometimes. I really do. When I look at the videos, you know what I mean?

78
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.690
I want to go, I don't want to get, but I have to with that. Thank you, man, man.

79
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.300
with it. So when's the Netflix. When is it? It's out. Yeah. It's out now.

80
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.270
It's a, you guys should go check it out. Man. Is a Schultz. Saves America.

81
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.270
That's what it is. Yeah. And then what else do you have going on? Nothing

82
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.230
[inaudible] stand up or no, I haven't done any actually I have. Yeah.

83
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.530
And weirdly enough, I haven't desired it. Yeah.

84
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.220
I think like my creative juices were fueled by this project that just took so

85
00:04:47.221 --> 00:04:51.960
much time. It was okay. And then weirdly enough,

86
00:04:51.961 --> 00:04:56.550
like doing pods, like in hanging around, not my own pod,

87
00:04:56.551 --> 00:04:57.660
but like doing other people's pods,

88
00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.340
especially if there's like people in the room,

89
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.200
I start to miss stand up a little bit.
