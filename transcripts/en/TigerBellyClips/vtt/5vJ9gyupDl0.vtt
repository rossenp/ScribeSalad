00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.750
<v 0>So, are you still a Christian? I still believe in God,</v>

2
00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:07.410
but I don't think that I did. You were a guy that wouldn't trick off.

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.650
I not until I was like 17. Yeah. Yeah. When I met you, you're like, Nope,

4
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.300
wait, hang on. I want to get, I wanna get into this. Um,

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.580
so what would you do when you would feel the urge?

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.030
Were you allowed to use your rub up against a wall without using your hands?

7
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.230
Jesus, no, I would get super creative.

8
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.510
I would go to a rock climbing gyms, just, you know,

9
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.310
just get stuck [inaudible] for a little bit.

10
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.190
Uh, well, I, I don't know. So until older,

11
00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:48.050
like I literally just didn't know I had no sex education at the

12
00:00:48.051 --> 00:00:50.180
Christian school that I went to. They literally like,

13
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.850
we ain't going to skip this section. Oh, wow. Yup.

14
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.470
Yup. We're going to move on from that. Yeah.

15
00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.630
And it was one of those things where I was like, okay,

16
00:00:59.631 --> 00:01:03.500
I just started getting an ungodly amount of where I was just like, this is,

17
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.320
this is crazy. Yeah. Like I was like, dude,

18
00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:08.720
if I hugged a girl in the hallway at high school,

19
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.690
it was like immediately.

20
00:01:11.691 --> 00:01:14.510
And I'm wearing like basketball shorts and I'm the kid who's like walking,

21
00:01:14.511 --> 00:01:16.580
like with the books and stuff, you know,

22
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.620
just trying to hide it and stuff like that.

23
00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:23.360
So then I started jerking off and then, you know, loved it. And

24
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.330
if it feels so good, it feels real. And that looked like this. Oh God.

25
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.950
Was there a bagel on top? It was literally, yeah. There was a bagel there.

26
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.430
Um, did you ever go into pornography or no, I did. Um,

27
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.040
only a few scenes I shot. Um, but I, I would look at porn,

28
00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:49.160
but there's a lot of guilt associated with that. And I actually,

29
00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:53.240
so I haven't been looking at porn during the pandemic really,

30
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.420
which I've been trying to avoid doing it.

31
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.140
Cause I feel better about my relationship and everything with my wife when I'm

32
00:02:00.141 --> 00:02:04.940
not looking at that stuff. I try not to consume that stuff because it makes,

33
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.820
it does make our sex better. For sure. Yeah. If I,

34
00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:11.810
if I'm avoiding looking at like graphic stuff online, like it's just, it,

35
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.370
it is more special as cheesy as that sounds. But, uh, I do think like I've,

36
00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:19.460
I've done it both ways, but when I'm, when I was on the road, it's like,

37
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.050
you gotta take care of it on the road. And I would like, you know, go to town,

38
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.970
like you'd have to yeah, you have to. Yeah.

39
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.580
Do you get girls hitting on you on the road now or no,

40
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.990
I don't think I put out that vibe. You don't have a sexual,

41
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.660
I know you're a sexual being. Right, right, right. No,

42
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.190
I'm going to throw that out there. Yeah.

43
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.520
You're a very sexual being and I could see why women would be attracted to you.

44
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.580
Thank you so much. Bye. But um, you have

45
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.930
[inaudible] [inaudible] yeah. Yeah. It's like a mute, Dante, you know,

46
00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:54.860
you have a very, like what, what is that disease that, where, um,

47
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.010
the skin is inside out Harlequin.

48
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.040
Bobby would send me photos all the time and say, I just found your doppelganger.

49
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.340
You would send me those photos all the time.

50
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.560
All the time you send me like graphic stuff.

51
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.780
<v 1>One time we were looking at, we were watching one of those shows and I,</v>

52
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.950
the kid had like Pierre, Robin syndrome. And you were like, this is a baby.

53
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.410
<v 0>Yeah. But you know, um, I apologize again. Um, it's okay.</v>

54
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.080
I'm changing as a person. I have to apologize.

55
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.370
Cause one time I did something as a comic that was very embarrassing in front of

56
00:03:35.371 --> 00:03:39.000
you Khalilah this and you, I doubt you. I doubt you remember this.

57
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.850
I remember everything you remember. Everything we were at,

58
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.080
we are at a yard house after one of the shows at the improv and we were eating

59
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.030
and Bobby was making Asian jokes and he was like saying jungle

60
00:03:51.031 --> 00:03:55.050
Asian and all this stuff. And I think I said like an Asian.
