1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.450
<v 0>Yes. Think about the hug. I felt it was pretty good.</v>

2
00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:07.370
It felt staged a little just because it was staged. Um,

3
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.470
and I think that's all I have.

4
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.180
I think that's all the thoughts that I know about it. Well, for me, um,

5
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.300
I did make it a little bit of a joke and try to make a little bit, and,

6
00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:21.260
and I looked at George, he wasn't smoking. So I had software.

7
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.640
He looks better than I used to look. I feel like, huh, nevermind,

8
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.810
sorry, yard. You look great.

9
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.970
<v 1>You ever done that exercise where you, um,</v>

10
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.340
have you ever done that exercise where you bet where you stare

11
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.400
at a stranger for a whole minute.

12
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.700
<v 0>I've done that where you stare at a stripper for a whole minute.</v>

13
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.050
Two is a good one. They ask you to leave

14
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.630
work. Is there a window or, or are you in the club or outside there?

15
00:00:56.631 --> 00:01:00.230
In the club. Right, bro. That's the old days though. Yeah.

16
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.860
That's another thing that I'm no longer going to ever do ever again. No,

17
00:01:03.861 --> 00:01:07.250
it was nice. Did you go to a lot of strip clubs? I did. Um,

18
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.690
not since I've been with Khaled,

19
00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:12.380
I've been to maybe two or three sets of about Kalila strip clubs.

20
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.740
<v 1>Since you've been with me. Oh, in the beginning. You mean problem? And maybe,</v>

21
00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:19.130
I don't know.

22
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.930
<v 0>I don't remember. Maybe I want, I don't remember.</v>

23
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.720
I don't even remember the last one I went to, but I just assume. Yeah.

24
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.330
I saw two servers of Windex in each other one time

25
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.260
they were next to each other as bodies. They were tightening up. Yeah.

26
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.700
And some of it to have that,

27
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.650
that when you're on the pole to have that the sound right.

28
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.480
I don't go with glitter. If they have glitter on bra. No.

29
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.750
Can you get a lap dance? It's like, it's like a sign. Yeah. Your bus. It's like,

30
00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:50.420
they're like, you know how snow leopards, you know what?

31
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.270
Sloan on a leopard is very elusive. Yeah, no.

32
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.340
<v 1>Yeah. They are very elusive and there's,</v>

33
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.130
they're barely on camera because they're very hard to find.

34
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.230
<v 0>Yeah, exactly. But snow leopards, snow leopards.</v>

35
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.610
<v 1>I think you're talking about the leopard seal. Aggressive,</v>

36
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.473
aggressive.

37
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.850
<v 0>I was never let's know limbs fall out in the, in Minnesota.</v>

38
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.310
You're not talking about this. That's what I'm talking about. Slow numbers.

39
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.200
Yeah, exactly. I was losing my mind, man.

40
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.660
So snow lepers will not see another snow leopard. Probably their whole life.

41
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.990
Wow. That's how rare they are. But they communicate each other.

42
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:31.700
Do you know how they communicate bra? Yes. They make different sounds. No.

43
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.510
No dude. You think another snow leopard is like right around the corner,

44
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.870
but they don't see each other. I know Johnny's right behind that Boulder,

45
00:02:38.871 --> 00:02:40.220
but I ain't going, gonna see him just going to go.

46
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.540
What the are you talking about, man? Me dude.

47
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.460
You're the one who's institutionalized.

48
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.690
Come out and learn, man. We're trying to deep.

49
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.740
We're trying to teach him about leprosy bro.

50
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.330
Being fricking to by face or trying to teach your dog. Okay.

51
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:07.750
Write that down too. By faith. By faith. Write that down to by for Batman.

52
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:11.200
I'm joking, man. I think you're a beautiful young man, you know,

53
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.900
but it's little leper. Um, very handsome, man.

54
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.360
I think he could be a mayor probably in some cities, different towns,

55
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.440
but in the Island. An Island mayor. Yeah, definitely.

56
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.270
There's a lot of water around the mayor, but yeah.

57
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.020
I don't know if you're a landlock, the leader

58
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.880
and easily run an Island. I appreciate that. Yeah,

59
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:38.050
man. Snow leopards. The way the communicate, snow leopard.

60
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.830
<v 1>Are you saying it's leper or leopard?</v>

61
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.140
<v 0>The, the phone hat. The cat cat. Cat. it. Let's move on from it then,</v>

62
00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:50.340
man. I want to know now you're a snow leopard Bobby. Isn't he? Yes.

63
00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.110
He pees out doors and he, and you'll never see anyone else like him.

64
00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.560
<v 1>So how do you communicate with Johnny around the block when you're the snow</v>

65
00:04:01.561 --> 00:04:02.394
leopard? Right?

66
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.530
<v 0>If I was a snake communication, rare signals.</v>

67
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.340
Hieroglyphs made of urine yet? No, no, no.

68
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.550
I'll tell you what's happening now guys. No,

69
00:04:14.551 --> 00:04:16.380
I don't even know why the I was even saying to you.

70
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.410
<v 1>You're saying that they, they, they, in their whole lifetime,</v>

71
00:04:19.411 --> 00:04:20.700
they barely come across the.

72
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.330
<v 0>Exactly what I was saying and how they communicate is they rubbed their sh they</v>

73
00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:28.380
rubbed their bodies on a tree. Oh, right. So then a year later,

74
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.850
another like their mother will smell that tree and go, Oh, Johnny's still alive.

75
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.970
That's cool. And then she'll rub and that's how they that's,

76
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.290
that's her cell phone. You don't have texting, you know, it's more of a Nokia.

77
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.600
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, you can only do one thing.

78
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.540
It's like a T-Mobile sidekick. Yay.

79
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.070
<v 1>I never got one of those. I was devastated. I was too poor to get that.</v>

80
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.340
<v 0>I had one, somebody gave it to me as a gift. One time. It was okay.</v>

81
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.940
It was big though. Big in your pocket.

82
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.710
Do you remember the first Nokia had that one game? Snake love it.

83
00:05:01.711 --> 00:05:04.950
And then when you played snake, you're like I'm in the future. Yeah.

84
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.440
Like you thought it was the most technological thing you've ever seen.

85
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.400
This is future, right? Yeah. I'm trying to think of what, but it was.

86
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.220
<v 1>It's snake was the best thing. That.</v>

87
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.770
<v 0>Was a great it's basically what it was. Oh yeah. So you're.</v>

88
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.790
<v 1>To catch little things without eating your own tail.</v>

89
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.700
So you couldn't touch your own tail. That's what it was.

90
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.530
<v 0>Taylor. You get longer, right?</v>

91
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.800
<v 1>You would have to escape, contact from your tail, but still be able to, um,</v>

92
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.010
it was it like a little Pac-Man thing that you would have any,

93
00:05:35.011 --> 00:05:36.900
it would add onto his body. Each time.

94
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.140
<v 0>It got so bad. My sponsor was like, you can't play snake no more.</v>

95
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.770
That's what it was. Look, I thought that was the future. I'm in blade runner.

96
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.280
Wow. Yeah. Now, you know,

97
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.210
what you can do all kinds of with video games. Yeah. Right.
