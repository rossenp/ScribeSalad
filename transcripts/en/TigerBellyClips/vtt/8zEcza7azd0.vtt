<v 1>Hopeful bars with Bobby Khalilah, Michael Bruce pig. Um, Rebecca,</v>

3
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:11.451
uh, Hey friends,

4
00:00:11.451 --> 00:00:14.690
my fiance and I are about to have a baby she's only two months along,

5
00:00:14.691 --> 00:00:17.360
but it seems so close to nine months. My, uh,

6
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.730
my problem is I can't get her to quit smoking cigarettes.

7
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.470
As soon as I found out she was pregnant,

8
00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:24.290
I quit because I want what's best for our baby in our family.

9
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.680
How can I try to convince her to quit without making her think she's against

10
00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:31.640
what's best for our family? I know she loves me and I know she'll love our baby,

11
00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:34.490
but I know she can love herself. Me and our baby so much more.

12
00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:38.360
If she does things she knows she needs to do. Thanks. Love you guys.

13
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.110
How does he convince his fiance to quit smoking for the baby?

14
00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.920
And you convince how do you convince Rebecca?

15
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.910
<v 0>I mean, it's pretty obvious. Number one, cigarettes kill you.</v>

16
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.490
They'll kill the mother. They could kill the baby.

17
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.460
They're doing harm that's for sure. Rebecca,

18
00:00:55.461 --> 00:00:56.960
this is why I push this over to you. Listen,

19
00:00:56.961 --> 00:00:58.640
there's one thing she knows about it's babies,

20
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.760
drinking miles pregnant while pregnant, eating,

21
00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:05.660
whatever kind of foods whilst pregnant. I was like, this is your wheelhouse.

22
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.180
All right. Let's let's let's okay, Rebecca. So I'm just going to say,

23
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:11.390
let's suppose I'm your friend where you, you and I have work.

24
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.950
I go to orange County. Okay. You and I have ring brunch, right?

25
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.700
You and I are having brunch. Right. And I'm talking collarless pregnant.

26
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.660
So I'm going to go to Rebecca Khalilah. You know,

27
00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:28.100
she's two months pregnant as you know, I'm right next to you in front of you.

28
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.810
And I'm just, and you see that. Yeah. She was smoking. She was pregnant.

29
00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:33.644
What would you say?

30
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.923
<v 1>I would say.</v>

31
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.020
<v 0>I'm completely. Non-confrontational be like, Oh my God, when you left,</v>

32
00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:43.070
I'd be like, Oh my God.

33
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.550
[inaudible] constantly, when she's pregnant, that's disgusting.

34
00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:54.110
And then whenever you come up, [inaudible],

35
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.020
I'm so bad like that. But yeah, no, she's really,

36
00:01:57.021 --> 00:01:59.150
really damaging the health for unborn baby.

37
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:02.360
That baby could be born with a low birth rate. I know that much.

38
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.370
If you smoke heavily, whilst pregnant. Sorry, but low birth weight.

39
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.080
Yes. I might've said right. Low birth weight.

40
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.320
I just don't think that it would be, it's not the healthiest,

41
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.150
like taking vitamins. Vitamins would be good. Right? Vitamins are great. Yeah,

42
00:02:20.151 --> 00:02:24.800
yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, it's not as bad as heroin. If it was heroin,

43
00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:28.010
I would be like, Hey man, put the needle down.

44
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.880
I feel like heroin is better than nicotine. You think so? Well,

45
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.580
no, not heroin. Cause the baby would yeah. Yeah. It'd be withdrawals. Yeah.

46
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.800
Yeah. Maybe crack

47
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.020
[inaudible]. Yeah. I just think, you know what I would do.

48
00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:50.630
I would just like sit down with her and go, listen,

49
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.420
I don't care what you do with your body. I do. Right.

50
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.070
But if you choose a smoke smoke, but you have our baby inside,

51
00:02:58.071 --> 00:03:02.410
you can you wait until you have the baby? Or at least be drunk.

52
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.720
You know what I mean? Get drunk,

53
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.520
drunk a cigarette can be nice, you know? Right, right, right.

54
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:12.100
You're not even drunk yet. You're sober. She's like, yeah. I'm here.

55
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.950
Print this risky. I would say, you know what I mean?

56
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.860
Like that stop being a selfish. Yeah.

57
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.040
That's crazy bit inside your stuff you should know better.

58
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.000
Is that a real question? That is a real question. That's a real question.

59
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.000
We get so many weird ones. Don't be a selfish. You have a baby inside you.

60
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.850
There we go. There we go. That's the answer. That's the answer.

61
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.870
Don't be a selfish. Do we have another one? Because that's a given. Yeah.

62
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.760
