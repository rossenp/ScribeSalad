WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.350
<v 0>He's a great standup.</v>

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.440
I'd done tours with him before I've done many shows with them.

3
00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:08.700
We've been in battles. We fought and where we scream at each other.

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.000
Um, but you know, he's been in many battles, actually.

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.630
He had an infamous battle with Dan cook outside his apartment. One time.

6
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.493
Remember that?

7
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:17.783
<v 1>Yes.</v>

8
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.770
<v 0>Ladies and gentlemen. He's a headliner.</v>

9
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.030
I'm from Pittsburgh originally and he's a dear friend and I'll know her.

10
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.270
I'll know him for the rest of my life. His name is Steve Byrne.

11
00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:30.104
Give him a round of applause.

12
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.780
<v 1>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay.</v>

13
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.530
Yes. Um, thanks for doing my podcast. Yeah.

14
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.090
I feel like I've done it already. Yeah. Has he done the podcast before?

15
00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:48.350
We've talked about him so many times. I do talk about you a lot. Yes.

16
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.010
Have I said good things? No,

17
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.370
that's just a bad thing. So yeah, those things get back to me, but I, yeah,

18
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.260
I know you though. So I don't, I know how you are, so I don't. Oh,

19
00:01:03.261 --> 00:01:08.120
how am I? Well, even when you said, like we've had our battles.

20
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.530
Okay. I think I come at things from like, uh,

21
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.210
like a pragmatic kind of like, you know, I don't get my emotions involved.

22
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.770
I think when we talk,

23
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.270
there have been times where emotionally I'm confused by the decisions you've

24
00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:26.690
made. But I just say,

25
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.690
I've never like when we've argued,

26
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.400
I've never left a conversation saying you just burned a major bridge.

27
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.880
I don't do like that. And I've said that you said that

28
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.670
you said that to me as you walk to like a Corolla and sped out a 30 miles per

29
00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:45.860
hour of the company. Okay. Yeah.

30
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.500
My car has nothing to do with this kind of business.

31
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.320
I burned a major bridge Hollywood power player.

32
00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:55.730
Bobby Lee Toyota, Corolla and speeds away.

33
00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.740
What was it before Corolla? You're right. Oh, wow. I'll tell you what a,

34
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.260
what a great friend. This is. He knows. I love Oasis love.

35
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.820
This is one of the things that irritates me, but I, again, I like, I don't,

36
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.570
I don't get, I don't say you burn a major bridge. I just go to this Bobby,

37
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.990
his car, your car broke down or something. Right?

38
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.340
Did your car broke down Corolla? Yes. Yes. Thank you.

39
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.220
Probably that night as he was leaving. Yeah. Um,

40
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.060
and then I had a Honda Santa Fe at the time and I was doing the

41
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.120
purple. No, it was silver. Oh yeah. So the reason why I thought it was purple.

42
00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:39.830
I'm not from Minnesota. So I led to, I said, Hey, take my car.

43
00:02:39.831 --> 00:02:43.070
I'm going on the road, use my car while I'm gone. Does that.

44
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.960
So I think about what, who does it a comic, a friend, whatever,

45
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.110
a friend, a friend, whatever, a friend.

46
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.770
When you burn the bridge at Burnett and take time to rebuild,

47
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.880
starting to rebuild. Right? So, so I lend them, my car, my car, he,

48
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.790
I get back in my car and I go to a play. My Oasis.

49
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.950
I go, where's my Oasis DVDs. Not one, not two, like three Oasis DVDs.

50
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.110
I call, I go CDs. I go by where's my, I threw them out the window. Oh my

51
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.070
why? Because I told you because you don't listen.

52
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.500
I lend you my car and I let you listen.

53
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.260
This is who I deal with. I'm the bad guy, but that's the thing.

54
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.770
I got another one. You guys ready for? Another one real quick, listen,

55
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.770
no wasted. Right. And then we'll move on to other things. But you don't listen.

56
00:03:37.771 --> 00:03:40.800
Right? I, I don't like the band. Okay.

57
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.560
Why is it tampered all over the thing? Like,

58
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.530
like it's a flyer for some sort of nightclub or something.

59
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.850
Now I love them now, but at the time.

60
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.450
<v 0>I didn't like them. I thought they were like too poppy, but I liked them now.</v>

61
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.160
I apologize. How much money do I owe? 60 bucks. Okay. All right.

62
00:03:59.161 --> 00:04:02.370
So what's the second thing I did. Oh, Oh, well,

63
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.290
I'm sure you now I have so many things that you have.

64
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.500
<v 1>Okay, good. Good. What? You will go tit for tat ahead. Oh,</v>

65
00:04:07.501 --> 00:04:09.990
you want me to put her down? All right. All right. Let's look at the cat.

66
00:04:09.991 --> 00:04:14.400
Then this guy calls me. Right. And he goes, get it over with,

67
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.533
because I was on a sitcom.

68
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.580
<v 0>Animal practice. It got canceled and I was really hurt by it. Sure.</v>

69
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.110
It was a really tough time because, um, I didn't have Khalilah at the time.

70
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.760
And, um, that was.

71
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.850
<v 1>I called you the night of premiere. I bet you don't remember that. I know.</v>

72
00:04:29.851 --> 00:04:33.420
Thank you. I watched it. I said, congratulations. He doesn't make,

73
00:04:33.421 --> 00:04:38.280
he forgets these things. This, this, ideally this next part. Yeah. Right.

74
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:39.503
So I watched it.

75
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.350
<v 0>He calls me, he goes, sorry about animal practice, but you know, I have a show.</v>

76
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.150
I go, yeah. Sullivan and son. Right. Because I was thinking about, you know, um,

77
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.990
you know, writing a character with UNL,

78
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.140
like so reoccurring and it's going to be really cool. And you know, um,

79
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.360
you know, at the time a med was on it,

80
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.500
the wonderful and the multifaceted Owen, Benjamin,

81
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.630
you know what I mean? Just the pure talent that he is, of course.

82
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.600
And I go, yeah, you're gonna ride.

83
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.940
<v 1>You know, you know, when somebody calls you for something like.</v>

84
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.260
<v 0>That, you start,</v>

85
00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:17.670
you lay down in bed and you start fantasizing what it's going to be like at the

86
00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:20.400
Warner brothers lot. You know what? It's like rehearsing,

87
00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:24.240
laughing with your friends. You're actually working. You're on TV with your,

88
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.690
you know, there's nothing better. Right.

89
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.560
And then three months later I find out Ken Jong is doing it.

90
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.480
Did that, that did that. Did that happen? You're old. You're old pals.

91
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.040
So my thing is, is this okay? I know why that happened.

92
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.080
<v 1>No, you think, you know why it happened and you bring this up. I love it.</v>

93
00:05:45.081 --> 00:05:47.520
You're wrong. You're tired right now. Your eyes you're getting wasteful.

94
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.900
[inaudible] let me get you the age fully tired. You better

95
00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.410
[inaudible].

96
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.410
<v 0>I know. Okay. So it doesn't make any sense. Okay.</v>

97
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.220
But we're in a different planet right now. Okay. And so if you look at like,

98
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.380
you know, we'll be Goldberg's vagina, right. If she's using it,

99
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.390
I bet it's more Goldberg than would be the.

100
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.280
<v 2>I bet it seems aggravated.</v>

101
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.300
<v 0>Yeah. But I'm sure if she uses it, it looks fine. That's all,</v>

102
00:06:22.301 --> 00:06:25.510
I'm not a scientist, but your labor is not a muscle. Yeah.

103
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.580
Do you ladies on a muscle. You cool. You cool? Yeah.

104
00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.350
But I know we're honeycombs from me.

105
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.980
<v 2>So we both win. We both lose. Where'd you say, honey comes from,</v>

106
00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:43.720
what was your auntie called? Woods? In the woods, but in honeycomb. Yeah.

107
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.250
Rodney comb. Where did that come from? You kook. You come, you want to call me?

108
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.390
[inaudible] you guys edited that in, in there? Yes you did.

109
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.110
We have it on factual files, dude. That's not a real thing. Factual.

110
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.660
[inaudible] isn't there a drawing that's supposed to happen right now,

111
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.530
downstairs and in the ship lobby. Can we get him a job

112
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.230
closed? Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, uh,

113
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.850
the buffet is close. Well, we were in Hawaii. A lot of people do look like you.

114
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.320
A lot of Filipinos work on the cruise ships.

115
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.710
<v 0>In the hotel. They all just kind of have your like bland look.</v>

116
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.180
<v 2>Yeah. Why don't you call me bland? I didn't at all.</v>

117
00:07:37.181 --> 00:07:40.810
I feel like it's a kind of an Island mahogany. Ooh. I like that.

118
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.930
<v 0>Work at, uh, you know, I could see it like at ABC. If you saw me in a hotel,</v>

119
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.570
you know, working there, you'd be like, yeah, that guy's weird.

120
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.070
Nobody can imagine you work.

121
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.793
<v 2>That's so.</v>

122
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.940
<v 0>You even say something like that. Let me say something right now. Okay. Let me,</v>

123
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.580
I used to work on a farm. Did you know that? An ant farm?

124
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:15.880
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

125
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.600
<v 0>That's cute. That's cute, man. No, man. A real farm.</v>

126
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.910
<v 2>Oh yeah. Well, were you guys growing, dude, honey.</v>

127
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.430
<v 0>The corn dude. Oh, really? Heard of corn. Yeah. Yeah. I used to work at a farm.</v>

128
00:08:27.431 --> 00:08:29.320
I used to work at a farmer's market.

129
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.980
<v 2>Or you just set a pharmacy or you're just saying things.</v>

130
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:37.120
<v 0>Used to work construction. I used to wait tables. I used to do a lot of jobs.</v>

131
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.700
You really? And I was a hard worker. Okay.

132
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.890
I don't it's only when showbiz got into my vein that I haven't really

133
00:08:44.891 --> 00:08:49.480
worked one vein. I believe that park one vein.

134
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:51.880
<v 2>One way in one way out.</v>

137
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.530
have you noticed that about yourself when you look in the mirror though? Yeah,

138
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:09.360
but my body took everything. Yeah, it did. Yeah. Yeah. I just have a greed.

139
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.950
Not fully formed. Is it? Uh, that,

you just said here's here's the thing about YouTube here it is.

145
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.640
They're just great. I thought I was going to say, Oh,

146
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.320
I didn't know you bottle was saying.

147
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.320
<v 4>Or is he like sick?</v>

148
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.670
<v 3>He got a tracheotomy. No way.</v>

149
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.320
The top story does say bono says he doesn't know if YouTube will tour again.

150
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.070
<v 4>Wait, but he has a trait. Like he actually has a hole in his.</v>

151
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.220
<v 3>Yeah, I remember that. That movie, no country for old man.</v>

152
00:09:58.221 --> 00:10:02.930
And that guy had that gun that would shoot holes through doors. Bano got hit,

153
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.160
got a hole in his throat from that. Oh, not from an Eric.

154
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.610
I think he just says a sore throat them. Sorry.

155
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.260
He just has a sore throat. I know.

156
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.360
But you can read the news and make up your own.

157
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.990
All right guy. No, no country for old men. No country for Bano.

158
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.930
Whoa. He's got Ireland.

159
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.960
I wonder if Bano gets a morning Bano?

160
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.290
Yeah, maybe, maybe. Yeah.

161
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.290
<v 4>Oh wait. He did have throat cancer in 2000.</v>

162
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.453
<v 3>Ha ha.</v>

163
00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.550
You're right. You're right. You're right.

164
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.190
<v 4>But the second brush with mortality had nothing to do with his throat.</v>

165
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.350
It was a high energy bicycle accident.

166
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.180
<v 3>You didn't do his throat.</v>

167
00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:10.040
[inaudible] man. Who was he laying on the sidewalk? I don't know.

168
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.940
Maybe they're like little tiny bite elf bikes. Ooh,

169
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:18.350
those hurt you also go to burning man, right? Yeah. Do you go every year?

170
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.930
I went three years in a row. I didn't go this year,

171
00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:24.800
but the last three before that I regretted not going this year. I really,

172
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:28.250
I wait. I woke up every morning going, why aren't I there?

173
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:34.790
Uh, first year I kind of went by myself and the second

174
00:11:34.791 --> 00:11:39.770
year I went with my buddy Michael Rosenbalm and then last year I went

175
00:11:39.771 --> 00:11:44.510
with my buddy Dan and uh, I think I'm going to go next year.

176
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:48.140
<v 4>You know, it's funny. I there's such a stigma, you know,</v>

177
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:51.740
on like just people who go to burning man in general, like, you know,

178
00:11:51.741 --> 00:11:55.150
the LA types. But I never, if there was a,

179
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.530
you seem like the perfect person to go to burning man with. If I ever,

180
00:11:59.531 --> 00:12:02.740
if I could ever think of anybody, I would want to go with you seem like.

181
00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:08.130
<v 3>Nope, she's not going with you. She is,</v>

182
00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:09.990
but she's not gonna do it.

183
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.980
I wouldn't allow it selfish.

184
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.810
<v 0>I am selfish. And when it comes to that dude.</v>

185
00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:21.900
<v 3>Why can't I take your girlfriend away in a camper for five</v>

186
00:12:21.901 --> 00:12:24.090
days? What's wrong with you?

187
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:31.440
That's my girl. Okay. Uh, okay.

188
00:12:31.441 --> 00:12:35.310
Mr. Scrooge humbug.

189
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.710
Call me Mr. Scrooge, bro. Yeah.

190
00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:41.760
Why can't I walk in a camp or with your beautiful girl?

191
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.960
<v 0>What would you do? What would you do out there with her in the desert?</v>

192
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.380
Like that?

193
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.220
<v 3>Ask her, what would you do with Harlan Williams.</v>

194
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:56.130
<v 4>Waltz around the Playa cook. Good food baby. You know.</v>

195
00:12:57.690 --> 00:12:59.370
<v 3>Hey, wait. I need to know.</v>

196
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.820
<v 0>I do need to know man, because I know you're out there. They don't take money.</v>

197
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.820
They trade services. Once you want to get a sandwich,

198
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:06.683
you got to sell her a little bit.

199
00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.350
<v 3>Just stop right now. Whoa, bro. You want a sandwich?</v>

200
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.820
You got to tell my little girl's out his eyes

201
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.210
for a meatball sandwich. You this round

202
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.090
one, this right. Don't.

203
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:26.190
<v 0>Do that, dude. That's human being right there.</v>

204
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:27.023
<v 3>Man.</v>

205
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.233
Do not see that.

206
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:41.130
<v 0>So two weeks ago he was playing Ontario and he goes, Hey, do Sunday. I go, okay.</v>

207
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.880
And then I never used to go. I was in two weeks, I was at the wind,

208
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:50.010
whatever the wind three sold out. How many seats, how many people,

209
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.630
that one was close to.

210
00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.800
That was 6,000 total seats sold out six months.

211
00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.530
So what we've learned today is this. What we learned today is this.

212
00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:01.470
We've learned a lot of things today, but we've learned that, um,

213
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:07.350
that you know a relationship isn't a two-way street. You know,

214
00:14:07.351 --> 00:14:09.390
sometimes when you have two people,

215
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.900
one's more generous than the other.

216
00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:18.870
And so I think by the facts of this trial and in

217
00:14:18.871 --> 00:14:21.280
this case, right, it,

218
00:14:21.281 --> 00:14:25.110
it shows that I'm the one that's being harmed.

219
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.910
I'm the one that gives and doesn't receive what the. I'm the one. Listen.

220
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:32.160
<v 3>Any of your.</v>

221
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.210
<v 0>Listeners got that? None of your listeners got that from this show.</v>

222
00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.580
Not one person that's listening.

223
00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:43.320
Yeah they did because they're my fans.

224
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:48.150
They're my fans too. Okay. And they get me, you know,

225
00:14:48.151 --> 00:14:50.040
after you know how to tell you this, my friend, I'll tell you this,

226
00:14:50.041 --> 00:14:54.590
my friend might write what I can't do two weeks in Ontario,

227
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.820
but I could sell out a weekend. And those people that come to my shows. Yeah.

228
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.520
Don't you love me. Do they love you? And I'm giving them a message.

229
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.750
What it has nothing to do with you. What I'm saying to you, people right.

230
00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.470
Is interrelationship. One person, right.

231
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:14.090
Is more giving sometimes than the other person and the other person. Right.

232
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:19.100
Being an Island, an Island, [inaudible] right. Being an Island.

233
00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:23.970
They suck up the energy sometimes. Ah, wow.

234
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.540
I've been to Korea. I've been,

235
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.300
I've been to the Philippines to France.

236
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:37.990
<v 2>[Inaudible] Korea. I love, I love that.</v>

237
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.500
And I love the Korean. I love your mud rivers. And I love the fact

238
00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:44.560

239
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.490
<v 0>Go ahead. Tell me about Korea. I love what you guys love you guys too. So much.</v>

240
00:15:51.491 --> 00:15:55.000
The 33% of the country that you can work.

241
00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.030
I love the fact that here, Oh man, you're talking about that right now. I'm just

242
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:07.630
What you guys get to do you get this much?

243
00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:10.960
This much goes to golf courses.

244
00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:17.140
And then this goes to a guy that looks just like you eat on the

245
00:16:17.141 --> 00:16:21.340
Northern part of interesting. So enjoy whatever that is. That,

246
00:16:21.341 --> 00:16:22.900
that area down there in the South.

247
00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.490
<v 4>You guys traveled together.</v>

248
00:16:24.491 --> 00:16:27.610
I want to see you go to the Philippines with Joe and maybe he can go with you.

249
00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.440
<v 0>Philippines. I would see to it. You know what I love. Okay. You know,</v>

250
00:16:32.441 --> 00:16:36.160
here's what, this is what it'll help me. And I'm being real.

251
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:40.030
Let's hang up each other and go to Korea and the Philippines that'd be great.

252
00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:44.500
I swear to God. That was so be so funny. All right. So I'm, I'm, I'm at work.

253
00:16:44.501 --> 00:16:48.940
Right? And I go to the comedy store. No, I was on my television network. Job.

<v 2>Yeah. Telephone television network.</v>

255
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:57.970
<v 0>The lady that's doing my hair and I'm like, I just,</v>

256
00:16:57.971 --> 00:17:01.150
I don't know why I throw this up. I go, well, will you last week? She goes, Oh,

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.580
I took a week off. My favorite festivals in Las Vegas.

So me and my husband went and what kind of she's like, uh, I guess, you know,

259
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:12.400
sort of doom rock festival, heavy metal. Right?

260
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.120
I don't pay attention. Yeah. Yeah. And I go, ah, she's like, it's.

261
00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.310
<v 4>Funny because there was a couple.</v>

262
00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:20.890
<v 0>Of comedians that went up. It's a chicken gigantic.</v>

263
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.230
<v 4>Oh, I just, it just hit me.</v>

264
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.540
There was a big festival that we went over and did. That's what you did.

265
00:17:28.541 --> 00:17:32.410
Okay. Go ahead. I didn't know it, my head. I forgot. I did that.

266
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.580
<v 2>So when it complimented, you didn't even know what the I was talking about.</v>

267
00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:44.290
Yeah. So I'm like, Oh, I go, Whoa, who the comedians?

268
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.233
And she goes, well.

269
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.010
<v 0>No, I don't like dies. I love dice. But it's like dies. He was okay. And I,</v>

270
00:17:50.011 --> 00:17:54.690
and I go, okay. But there was a girl before that went up and I got [inaudible].

271
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.410
She was very funny. And in my head I dies.

272
00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:03.360
And then when she said there could only be one. No. And I'm like,

273
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:07.860
it's my second ex fiance. I know. And I go, is it? And I Googled juror,

274
00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:09.743

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:13.730
<v 1>She gets debts. Right.</v>

276
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:16.100
So then when I see her, you know.

277
00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:21.120
<v 0>Later, a couple of days later I take podcast and I go in and I go, Hey,</v>

278
00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.570

279
00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:28.850
<v 1>Hey, hair, lady. You know, she was at the Vegas. And she said, you, you great.</v>

282
00:18:35.661 --> 00:18:36.494
The whole time

283
00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:42.800
that you on it the whole time then gave the compliment. Like no way it can't be,

284
00:18:42.801 --> 00:18:46.220
it can't be that somebody saw Eleanor and she was good. her. I hate her.

285
00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:53.630
[inaudible] say it. And you're like, I gave you a compliment. I'm like,

286
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:55.010
you didn't give me a compliment.

287
00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.890
<v 1>She did. Yeah. But I, the information I know, but.</v>

288
00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:01.490
<v 2>You just reiterated it to me. Don't come at me.</v>

289
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:06.860
<v 1>I know. I know. But can I just say this though? All right. Is it,</v>

290
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.110
I didn't have to give you that information.

291
00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.750
<v 2>I kept it inside when I ride at night.</v>

292
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:18.680
<v 1>And I go and I go, I'm going to make this pitch. That'd be, feel good. Right?</v>

293
00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:24.680
Filthy white. And so I throw it out there and I just don't.

294
00:19:24.681 --> 00:19:26.000
I didn't like the responses. That's all.

295
00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.420
<v 2>Wait, did it really hurt your feelings? Cause I didn't mean to,</v>

296
00:19:29.421 --> 00:19:31.010
but we were on a podcast. So you know, I'm.

297
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:36.200
<v 0>I was kidding too. Okay. But you don't watch game of Thrones? No,</v>

298
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:39.170
I don't watch that kind of stuff. What do you mean?

299
00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:42.710
Just people fighting in the past and all of that weight.

300
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.410
<v 1>Is that a historical document about the past?</v>

301
00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:51.200
This is something that really had no, it's not. Yes. I don't want Elizabeth. No,

302
00:19:51.201 --> 00:19:52.370
it's not that kind of stuff.

303
00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:54.530
<v 0>Bro. [inaudible] maybe I'll read.</v>

304
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:58.700
<v 1>Up on it a little bit. Look at me. No, no, no. You know what, dude,</v>

305
00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:00.140
I'm tired.

306
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.750
<v 0>I'm tired too, man. What time is it? I.</v>

307
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:07.260
<v 1>Know. I know arms hurt too. No, no, no.</v>

308
00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:07.970
You're good.

309
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:09.170
<v 0>We'll do a couple more minutes. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

310
00:20:09.171 --> 00:20:12.410
I am going to do a couple more minutes while I grill you. Okay.

311
00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.480
<v 1>Grill away, dude. Oh, well dude. All right.</v>

312
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:17.480
<v 0>I'm tired of your. Wake up with the King. This dude.</v>

313
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:19.100
It's making burgers over here.

314
00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.420
<v 1>Right? Right. You liked it. You know what you like to do?</v>

315
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:27.770
<v 0>You'd like to destruct me. I do word games, dude.</v>

316
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:33.020
<v 1>Yeah. You don't do that again. Either. It gets away from it.</v>

317
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:34.490
It's a couple of pieces of glass.

318
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.770
You have too much warning blips way too much morning.

319
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:42.710
Hey this morning bro. Yeah. It's starting a hell of an afternoon in my.

320
00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:48.010
I will say that. What I'm saying is daylight savings.

321
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.390
<v 2>Time in my. Yeah.</v>

322
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:57.250
But you know, you look nice tonight then. No, don't do that right now.

323
00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:58.203
I'll do that right now.

324
00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:02.910
<v 0>No. What I'm saying to you is this, okay, this is this. Okay. Is that,</v>

325
00:21:02.911 --> 00:21:06.120
what did I say that a lot, right? Yeah. I'm sorry. No, don't be apologize.

326
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:10.380
It's not a bad thing. All right. Is it's a great show.

327
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:15.240
I think you'd really like it. It's like in terms of pop culture.

328
00:21:15.241 --> 00:21:16.800
I think there's not a better show out there.

329
00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:22.350
<v 2>No, I mean game of Thrones. Oh yeah. I haven't seen it. I know you haven't.</v>

330
00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:28.860
Oh wow. I have no, I'm not going to let him do it.

331
00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:31.620
He's not in a Groundhog yet. Little guy. No,

332
00:21:31.621 --> 00:21:35.460
you're doing defense mechanisms that you do. Right.

333
00:21:35.461 --> 00:21:37.800
And then you try to divert me and I go, Oh yeah. Okay.

334
00:21:37.801 --> 00:21:42.720
I guess it's like Jedi mind tricks, but I'm Jabil. It doesn't work with me.

335
00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:45.240
That you're just. I didn't do it.

336
00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:52.530
I'm not doing anything, dude. Oh my God. You're a dummy.

337
00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.260
You're a bright young man. You watch it.

338
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:02.190
Watch it. You don't watch it, dude. All right. Oh,

339
00:22:02.191 --> 00:22:07.050
what are these prescription pills on the table? It's for my panic attacks. Well,

340
00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:07.993
yeah.

341
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.260
[inaudible] yeah, I dude, I'm about to stroke out, back off the T what is it?

342
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.410
A drug that they're always putting in, uh, Asian people's food.

343
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.020
[inaudible] back off the MSG. Daddy,

344
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:30.420
you out there putting speakers in your car pocket. Sipping on soy sauce, dude.

345
00:22:30.421 --> 00:22:34.190
Back off. Good advice. You should scale back on.

346
00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:36.090
I'm going to scale back on the soy sauce. Okay.

347
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:39.530
Right now we're getting somewhere. All right. But I listen. Right?

348
00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:42.590
<v 0>You gave me a suggestion. I listened. Yeah. I'm sorry. No, don't apologize.</v>

349
00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.340
Cause there's nothing to apologize for. All right.

350
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.110
You're going to watch game of Thrones. Okay. I'll watch it. Every episode.

351
00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:54.210
<v 2>No bro. No. Ah, yes. Okay. Oh yeah.</v>

352
00:22:54.211 --> 00:22:55.350
Yeah. Shouldn't have said, okay.

353
00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.470
<v 0>Yeah, you sit. Okay. And that's a problem. How many episodes are there?</v>

354
00:22:58.650 --> 00:22:59.550
Seven seasons.

355
00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.393
<v 2>Man.</v>

356
00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:07.470
<v 0>So 10 seasons in an episode. 10 episodes. 70 of us.</v>

357
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:09.540
And what's it about?

358
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.660
<v 2>It's about the past, the past.</v>

359
00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:16.710
I got to do, man.

360
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:19.230
<v 0>You're going to do it. I'll watch some of it.</v>

361
00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:20.880
Oh they are so sensitive about that.

362
00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:24.900
<v 2>I just don't get it. Bobby. I know you, you play on the, um,</v>

363
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:27.570
on the funny all the time. Like you play on the funny,

364
00:23:27.571 --> 00:23:31.350
but I it's got to offend you win. Cause you're you're a shock comic. Like you,

365
00:23:31.351 --> 00:23:35.760
you do like to say what's on your mind. You do hate me. That look.

366
00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:41.160
There's a bunch of words you said before this show started. Yup. Yeah,

367
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:45.230
we do. Do we not have to edit book?

368
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.930
I want to say this. Do we not have to edit a bunch of words?

369
00:23:47.931 --> 00:23:48.764
But you want to talk about.

370
00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.090
<v 1>You want to talk about that was said before we even started this thing.</v>

371
00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.610
<v 2>We'll tell you something right now. I know,</v>

372
00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.553
but I'm gonna tell you something right now.

373
00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.870
<v 1>Dude. All right. I say up. Things like that.</v>

374
00:23:58.871 --> 00:24:03.850
So I don't say it on the podcast so I can just get it out. Okay. I'm purging it.

375
00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:09.190
All right. Got it. Right. God man. You pepper.

376
00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:14.210
Is that my camera? Yeah. I also was. I wanna just I to say to you that, um,

377
00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:15.640
yeah, go ahead the first time.

378
00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.130
<v 2>Yeah, no, no. I know. You've heard some things. I said this.</v>

379
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:23.800
The only reason I'm here. That's your little tag, a belly crew

380
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:28.810
being misinformed. What did you call you? People. The tag of Belize,

381
00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:33.550
black sleepers slept keto sleep sleep was, had been lied to what is the lie?

382
00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.500
Go ahead. I saw this little clip.

383
00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:38.950
Do the Brown in there and your little office with the sycophants

384
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.640
and Michael Bisping. He just didn't know me or anything.

385
00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:50.350
That's not how it went down at all. No, first of all, Michael,

386
00:24:50.351 --> 00:24:53.370
I want to say this doesn't look any different to sitting down.

387
00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:01.750
[inaudible] it's like you leaned forward. I was very funny.

388
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.130
Very funny. But let me say, I'll tell you the way it went down.

389
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:11.100
Give your version and I'll give mine for the, what did they call it again?

390
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.850
Okay. So every course, every one.

391
00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:20.370
<v 1>Well, because you know, Joe Rogan is a standup. He's a long time friend of mine.</v>

392
00:25:20.371 --> 00:25:25.060
I've known him for 20 years, 25 years. Um, love him. Great guy.

393
00:25:25.061 --> 00:25:27.790
But um, so a lot of, you know, I'm a huge UFC fan.

394
00:25:27.791 --> 00:25:32.610
So who's that little guy from Sacramento. I like [inaudible] right.

395
00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:35.560
You're a father, a man. He's a nice guy. We hugged this and that.

396
00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.850
But then when I saw Bisbing Michael, you for the first time there,

397
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.540
I literally was struck. I was just like, Oh.

398
00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:45.460
That's Michael Bisbing right.

399
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.050
And I try to come up to you and I sit and you were very nice, but I said,

400
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:53.200
Hey man, I'm a big fan. And you were, you know, because when I walk,

401
00:25:53.201 --> 00:25:56.860
I was at the grocery store and people come up to me and go, Oh,

402
00:25:56.861 --> 00:26:00.400
you're very funny. And you want to be cordial. Right. But I also,

403
00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:05.020
if that person that said hi to me was Josh Groban. Right.

404
00:26:05.021 --> 00:26:08.200
And right. Okay. And I blew him off. Right.

405
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.050
I bet that Josh Groban would probably be a little mad.

406
00:26:11.051 --> 00:26:13.270
So he was at the comedy store where.

407
00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:18.490
<v 2>I don't know who judge, I've got zero context of what you're saying.</v>

408
00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.730
[inaudible] opera singer. I'm always at the opera. Right. So when Michael,

409
00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:28.653
his business there.

410
00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:32.530
<v 1>He said very nice, but he could have just walked away. And I wanted some,</v>

411
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:33.393
you know what I mean?

412
00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.100
<v 2>No, I didn't really, but he did walk away</v>

413
00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:41.500
version of this story already. And here's the reality. And I'm not,

414
00:26:41.501 --> 00:26:46.260
when I say this, by the way, by the way, massive fan. Hence why I'm here.

415
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:51.120
Head's wire drove up from orange County audition and I waited for three and a

416
00:26:51.121 --> 00:26:55.800
half hours get five to 30. I was half asleep, half an hour ago. Okay.

417
00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:59.640
Just partner some coffee. Now I'm drinking this shake. Try and stay awake.

418
00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:02.580
And I'm very happy to be here. You have the hilarious comedian.

419
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:06.660
I never met you before. Okay. Hold on.

420
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:11.790
Get into the pie. The lung suffering. Mrs. Bisping.

421
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.730
That's at home. God bless her. She doesn't get out very often.

422
00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.880
She's got three kids. I travel a lot. I took her out.

423
00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:21.780
We went out for a nice dinner and went to go watch some comics and a lot of the

424
00:27:21.781 --> 00:27:24.810
time. And I'm not trying to say that I'm a big dealer or anything like that.

425
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:27.600
But a lot of time you stop and you take pictures and this and that.

426
00:27:27.601 --> 00:27:29.040
And then after a while you got to say, okay,

427
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:33.630
because I'm here with my wife and I'd done about 10 pictures in a roll while

428
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:37.080
she's standing there like a lump of cheese. Right. Doing nothing.

429
00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:40.380
So then after that, I'm like, okay, all right. All right, bet. Let's go in.

430
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:45.270
And then you, after that say now, sorry mate, we're done pick your time is all

431
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:51.360
right. You should start doing now. Let me say something. Right? So when you, Oh,

432
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.930
not fair. Sorry if I didn't put a random stranger before my wife.

433
00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:58.920
I'm so sorry. I know you're the gray

434
00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:03.900
and the company's stories, your house and you're totally right.

435
00:28:03.901 --> 00:28:08.040
It is your house, but we'd never met. And that's the mother of my children.

436
00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:10.290
<v 1>And the way.</v>

437
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.640
<v 2>I accept your apology, you're, it's fine. It's fine.</v>

438
00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:18.570
paws out of my face right now. You weren't, you weren't.

439
00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:21.420
<v 1>He was devastated though. He called.</v>

440
00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:26.040
<v 2>Me immediately ran to the parking lot and he was like, you can't,</v>

441
00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:27.210
you won't believe what happened.

442
00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:31.250
Go for what?

443
00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:34.970
<v 1>Right. But no, but could I say this please? Can I say this, please go ahead.</v>

444
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.080
You did give me a photo.

445
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:40.370
<v 2>I did. Yes. I remember it. I was standing over the barrel. Yes.</v>

446
00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:45.290
<v 1>With Diaz. And I walked up because when you were talking to Diaz, you know that,</v>

447
00:28:45.291 --> 00:28:48.500
then I see as my opportunity and we took the photo, you know what?

448
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:52.610
I was just talking out of my. Right. Just talking or whatever,

449
00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.040
thinking that you're ever going to hear. Right.

450
00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:00.200
<v 2>It's okay. I do it all the time. If I was held accountable,</v>

451
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:03.050
every piece of dog that came out of my mouth,

452
00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:08.570
I'd probably be in prison or ex-communicated from whoever I know.

453
00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.180
<v 1>And you know, I want to say this too, is, is that.</v>

454
00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.110
<v 2>Never let the truth get in the way of a good story. Right. You know,</v>

455
00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:22.340
I've never heard it before, but Chinese proverb,

456
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:28.020
Asians like that, man, what do you mean with the Asian, Chinese? Proper?

457
00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:39.710

<v 1>Fight right. Was crazy.</v>

459
00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.200
I don't want to talk about you, but here's what I do want to talk about. Okay.

460
00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:50.640
<v 0>What about you? But I have a couple of other quotes. I want a favor.</v>

461
00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.990
And my favorite is the next time you do a gigantic show, like at a theater show.

462
00:29:54.991 --> 00:29:55.980
One of your like stadium.

463
00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:59.600
<v 1>Bobby. Where's my</v>

464
00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:08.190
there's Mo this multi-camera the small, tight I have offered.

465
00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:12.960
I have offered every show that I've had. I said, Bobby,

466
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:17.880
just walk on stage. You don't have to ask. You don't have to tell anybody.

467
00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:22.980
Just walk on. And what do you say every time? No,

468
00:30:22.981 --> 00:30:27.510
you don't. Does he say that he hasn't replied? He never replies.

469
00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:32.160
You're a piece of. I know. And that's okay.

470
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:35.820
That's the, mine's my camera.

471
00:30:35.821 --> 00:30:38.160
Is it the one behind me or the one directly in front of you in the mirror.

472
00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:40.290
So you look at that camera. I'll look at this one.

473
00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:47.040
So what you tell me, you tell me, Bobby, sorry.

474
00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:48.413
Tell me.

475
00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:52.440
<v 0>So I'm saying to you right now, people, okay. Listen to me right now.</v>

00:31:02.641 --> 00:31:02.910
Okay?

<v 1>Don't do it for fun. You know,</v>

481
00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:09.450
going on goalie on his side would only be for fun. Filipino liar.

482
00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:10.320
He's a liar.

483
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:14.940
<v 0>This goes around all over the world theaters, right?</v>

484
00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:16.970
I've asked for some.

485
00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:21.000
<v 1>Emotional help. Oh, I like your podcast. Kidding me.</v>

486
00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.780
Give me nothing. And then last week you're gonna have a Netflix special.

487
00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:29.880
Can you do target? But like I'll clear Monday for you. You. Cause I love you.

488
00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:33.070
I sold 400 meters out in Hawaii.

489
00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:38.880
[inaudible] you don't deserve it. Sometimes. You don't deserve it sometimes.

490
00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:44.070
Anyway. Anyway, what are we on time? Oh, that was it Howard.

491
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:48.960
Nope. Can we get through this on helpful advice? Yeah. Oh my God.

492
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.820
How come you never watched the cartoon?

493
00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.540
How did you miss out on that? Oh, is that good?

494
00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:01.230
Gilbert, look at me. It's that good? That I'm missing out.

495
00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:06.510
You know what? I'll watch that tonight. I'm not mesmerized.

496
00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:09.450
If it's not light bulb right?

497
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:13.090
The next day he's singing all the songs around the house, but you're already,

498
00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.880
I'm going to tell you, I'm going to tell you.

499
00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:18.810
<v 0>I would. I think it's about okay. Okay. There's a man. Yes.</v>

500
00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:23.250
He's some sort of curse. Okay. Right. And he turned into a Buffalo,

501
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:28.460
whatever it might be. Yeah. Okay. Goat, Buffalo. All right. And then,

502
00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:32.100
and then there's like a salt shaker.

503
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:39.920
<v 1>Okay. [inaudible].</v>

504
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:44.930
<v 2>Sicker a light bulbs. A soy sauce bottle is Japanese.</v>

505
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:46.930
Yeah.

506
00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:51.430
<v 0>You know what I mean? And a, um, old, old timey trash cans.</v>

507
00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.353
Right.

508
00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:57.310
They come alive and they start because what I assumed that he was a

509
00:32:57.311 --> 00:33:01.570
King and those were all his like compatriots or whatever.

510
00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.960
And there's some sort of curse. They turned into shot, salt, shakers.

511
00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:07.870
He turned into a goat. Right. And they're bummed.

512
00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:12.580
They're livid because you can't live like a salt shaker. You know what I mean?

513
00:33:12.581 --> 00:33:15.280
You're just shaking the whole time you're walking around. You know what I mean?

514
00:33:15.281 --> 00:33:16.600
People know when you're coming. Yeah.

515
00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:24.940
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

516
00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:29.530
<v 0>All right. And then, you know, the gold meets, there's a lady,</v>

517
00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:34.000
a girl comes in into town. She's fresh. She's fresh into town.

518
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.990
She fray. Right. She comes through the, you know, the castle,

519
00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:42.640
she meets this goat and she's scared at first. Right. She's like,

520
00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:47.290
ah, man, just go creature. I don't wanna be around it. You know?

521
00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.160
And then they fall in love and something happens at the end.

522
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:54.970
There's a bunch of songs. Okay. Thousands of songs they sing. Yeah. Yeah.

523
00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.500
And then at the end,

524
00:33:56.501 --> 00:34:00.060
something happens where he turns back into human and they fall in love.

525
00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:01.570
But do I have the gist?

526
00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:04.390
<v 2>I feel like you've watched it and you're playing it off. Like you did it now.</v>

527
00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:08.320
I'm going to say this right now. God.

528
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:12.100
<v 0>On my life that I've never seen it.</v>

529
00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:17.440
That's conviction in his eyes. I believe God. On my operas life ask my brother.

530
00:34:17.441 --> 00:34:20.340
I've never seen any of that. Right?

531
00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:27.160
<v 2>Accused me. You broke your iPad.</v>

532
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:32.110
You just accused me of treason against.

533
00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:37.270
<v 0>Against my speech. My race, not my race, my gender.</v>

534
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:42.750
<v 2>The male gender. I've never, no one ever accused me of piercing looking.</v>

535
00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.680
<v 0>Don't tell him. So Mike, do I have to just.</v>

536
00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.930
<v 2>Yes. You're pretty good. That's amazing.</v>

537
00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:51.760
We'll just give him more movies and see.

538
00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:56.020
<v 1>And um, let's just bury the hatchet with everything. Okay.</v>

539
00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.950
I know everyone has say it again. Okay. In other podcasts, we're ending it now.

540
00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:04.600
Whatever, because there's a lot of purity and goodness that comes from you.

541
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.110
Yeah. I mean, I haven't talked about you at all,

542
00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:09.400
but you're the one that talks about me.

543
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:13.060
So when you're saying we bury the hatchet, you bet,

544
00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.990
you bet you do. Okay. Let me rephrase this. The screencap of,

545
00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:22.420
let me rephrase that. And this is what it is. Okay. Yes. I,

546
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:24.040
you could have just let it go with that.

547
00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:26.770
<v 2>I could have said we bury the hatchet.</v>

548
00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:30.070
<v 1>No, we could have just moved onto the next thing. Right.</v>

549
00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:35.200
But then you had to add in right. You bury it. I know whatever.

550
00:35:35.201 --> 00:35:38.290
That's what it sounded like you the hatchet, where, where,

551
00:35:38.291 --> 00:35:39.150
where have you ever been?

552
00:35:39.151 --> 00:35:42.750
Where you're like word on the street is burns talking on. Like, where's that?

553
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.050
No, because just have more of a rat pack style perhaps.

554
00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:50.370
But I don't like Sebastian Maniscalco in that way, you guys have like a real,

555
00:35:50.371 --> 00:35:55.020
like I just keep to myself, like the rat pack, like a team,

556
00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.960
they don't, you know, meet you. Don't rat your friends out, you know,

557
00:35:57.961 --> 00:35:59.100
like mafia stuff. Right.

558
00:35:59.101 --> 00:36:04.080
He has those things and I'm the guy that dies five minutes into

559
00:36:04.081 --> 00:36:07.880
the mafia movie. Right. I get stabbed a thousand times by pencil,

560
00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.280
just in the first five minutes of the movie. That's how,

561
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:15.990
because I'm a talker and I'm a coward. Right. But you know,

562
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:20.400
you know, I'm okay. Yeah. But let's just bury it now I'll bury the hatchet.

563
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:24.810
Okay. Since you didn't, you don't have a hatchet, I'll bury the hatchet.

564
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:29.460
Y'all bear for life and then you and I can move on. Yes. Right. But you know,

565
00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:33.840
watch it. I'm not afraid to,

566
00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:38.040
you know, you know, I love you though. That's what you're here.

567
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:41.940
You know? I love you. Listen, you have, you do know that correct.

568
00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:47.810
<v 4>For the fact that he does get especially triggered by you because I think he has</v>

569
00:36:47.811 --> 00:36:50.600
a deeper love for you than he has for compared to other people.

570
00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.870
Because when he had you guys had that weird thing at the comedy store. Yeah.
