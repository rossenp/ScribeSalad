1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
<v 0>Depending on what part, where you are at one part of the country,</v>

2
00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:04.530
or if it was a Trump rally and kill.

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.550
<v 1>You think so? Yeah. We love Lieutenant Dan,</v>

4
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.170
but I'll even call Lieutenant Wang. Okay.

5
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.920
<v 2>Right. Lieutenant. Right.</v>

6
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.650
<v 3>It'd be a possibly safe version of that as you came out of wheelchair,</v>

7
00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.390
but you just put green screen on your legs.

8
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.100
So people know that you're not really.

9
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.210
<v 2>No, no. Th the whole trick though, is to fool the audience, the artists,</v>

10
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.830
the artists to push. These are just ideas that I have it, my little mind.

11
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:32.900
<v 3>Sometimes they won't be executed.</v>

12
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.300
<v 2>You know, really does hurt me though. When people say that I'm dumb on Twitter,</v>

13
00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:39.134
people say that.

14
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.670
<v 3>What is the one constant insult you've heard your entire life joking or dumb.</v>

15
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.893
So that's why.

16
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.440
<v 2>Yeah. Shaffir used to do it all the time that you're dumping,</v>

17
00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:53.120
never read a book and just tease me. And it's just like, sounds like trauma.

18
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.310
You think it is? Yeah, of course.

19
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.760
And it used to feed into something and I'm like, maybe I am dumb.

20
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.560
I don't think that I am.

21
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.350
<v 0>I think that you have a different kind of intelligence</v>

22
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.320
[inaudible].

23
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.530
<v 1>That's.</v>

24
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.131
<v 0>True. Right?</v>

25
00:01:07.131 --> 00:01:11.990
Like traditional classroom intelligence is not a gauge for,

26
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.740
so like, it doesn't speak to so many other kinds of intelligence.

27
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.240
<v 2>Well, like when I was in junior high, junior high, when I was in, uh,</v>

28
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.760
a community college, junior high community college. Right. Yeah.

29
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.780
You get it. And, um, you know, I, I, the first, I only did a semester,

30
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.430
but the first semester,

31
00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:35.900
the only good grades I got was in philosophy because I care for some reason I

32
00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:37.370
was so depressed. Right.

33
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.370
That would just kind of dive into like philosophical ideas,

34
00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:44.960
you know what I mean? And just existentialism or, or whatever, and whatnot.

35
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.850
And I used to like, you know, if I, if my interest is in something, right,

36
00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:53.960
I'm full in it, you know what I mean? But if I'm not interested in something,

37
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.470
it just, just got, it kind of enters my brain and leaves, you know,

38
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.130
I don't have, like, I don't absorb things like star Trek,

39
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.060
next generation I'll absorb every information to it. Star Wars.

40
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.800
So every information.

41
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.490
<v 0>How you can tell what he truly cares about or have interests.</v>

42
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.440
Cause he has like a really good retention for certain details and like really

43
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:19.430
specific things like even people's names. But then, um,

44
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.130
for other things, absolutely like his,

45
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.260
his brain is wiped clean off of the information.

46
00:02:24.261 --> 00:02:26.780
Like he doesn't retain any of it at all can.

47
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.000
<v 2>Retain it. So.</v>

48
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.170
<v 0>It hurts me when I have to tell him like my life story for the eighth time.</v>

49
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.541
<v 3>Khalilah, you're different.</v>

50
00:02:35.541 --> 00:02:38.610
I feel like you almost retain a little bit of everything.

51
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.950
<v 0>Yeah. That's it, that's like, I'm kind of an absorbent Tron where it's like,</v>

52
00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:46.160
I don't need to be actively listening for me to,

53
00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:50.960
for it to be downloaded into my hard drive. Like somehow, like if it,

54
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.940
if I happen to see it, uh,

55
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.450
it it'll be tucked somewhere and I can retrieve it when I need to.

56
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.820
But, um, that's not a good thing.

57
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.100
It's not because you in life in order to be somebody who can, you know,

58
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:08.170
like have things roll off your shoulder,

59
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.970
you need to have the memory of a goldfish. Like I don't forget pains and aches.

60
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.010
Like things that hurt me, people have hurt me.

61
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:19.020
Like these things like are very fresh in my mind. Like I want to be like my,

62
00:03:19.021 --> 00:03:23.830
my stepdad, Roger. I, he has like a seven, seven memory,

63
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.110
seven second memory. Like you could,

64
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:29.920
you could get into like a custom match with him and it's seven seconds later.

65
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:33.550
He'd be like, do you want some coffee, sweetie? Like he just has a bowl memory.

66
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.600
No, he doesn't. He's just always been that way. Like he doesn't have a very, um,

67
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.550
you know, he doesn't retain a lot.

68
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.760
<v 2>Yeah. Like I'll memorize.</v>

69
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.770
How many fish Jean-Luc Picard has in the tank behind him

70
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.360
crazy. Right. In an episode, I go, yeah, that's two in this episode. Right?

71
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.560
Like I'll memorize little things on people in the background of movies and TV

72
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.700
shows. Right. But then there's certain things that just like, I don't know,

73
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.710
especially like when it comes to science or something like that,

74
00:04:01.711 --> 00:04:04.530
I just don't get it. Um, yeah. Or mathematics.

75
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.220
<v 0>Mathematics. How far did you ever take math in college</v>

76
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.780
Palomino? Would that.

77
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.260
<v 2>I understand it. What I do,</v>

78
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.060
the only way I can do it is like Stardew Valley. So this is how I count.

79
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.480
So what I'll do is, um, on my farm,

80
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.270
you get these pigs and the pigs, they, they, they release truffles.

81
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.300
Right. And sporadic, you don't know, you know what I mean?

82
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.880
So what I'll do is I won't count the truffles that they've.

83
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.640
<v 1>Oh, this is good, Bobby.</v>

84
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.430
I won't, I won't.

85
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.760
<v 2>I won't count how many I pick up. Right. And I also won't comment,</v>

86
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.050
count how many I have in the chest in one of my sheds. Right.

87
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.190
So what I'll do is I'll just pick them all up, pick up and then pick up all the,

88
00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:57.720
all ones in the sh in the, in the, in the chest and then to put them in the, um,

89
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.100
the truffle maker machine. Right. I, so I've,

90
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.130
I've 30 truffle maker machines. It's a bit much.

91
00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.360
<v 0>You have to work to, to get these, to get the truffle maker machine.</v>

92
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.460
<v 2>We make them. And each one is very difficult to make, you got to get slime,</v>

93
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.220
bright, classic. And it's either you have to farm them in, in, in, in, um,

94
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.080
mines, or you have to build it a slime farm, which I'm not going to do.

95
00:05:25.081 --> 00:05:28.740
I don't have enough room on mine. farm for a slime.

96
00:05:28.741 --> 00:05:31.620
Farm is the only space you have to take up for that.

97
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.390
<v 0>I don't know too much about slime baby, but I trust.</v>

98
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.330
<v 1>Right.</v>

99
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.320
<v 2>And then here's the, here's the proponent that does very difficult to get.</v>

100
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.550
Not just wood. You have to get hardwood. Okay.

101
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.600
And hardwood, you can only get that two ways,

102
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.800
three ways, hardwood. You can only get it from the secret farm for us.

103
00:05:52.801 --> 00:05:57.800
That's the main way. Right. Which is far away. Yeah. They usually won't there.

104
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.240
It takes all day, no fast travel. D D uh, later in the game,

105
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:07.100
you can create these spheres or these podiums where you

106
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:11.630
can fast travel to places. You sound like an engineer to me, that's all. you.

107
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:12.420
All right.

108
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.310
<v 0>This, this, this is slime naturally occur. Or are there like,</v>

109
00:06:15.311 --> 00:06:19.750
hagfish that prey in the water that produced this lime that you then harvest.

110
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.630
<v 2>The slime is from the slime creatures, fish. Like hagfish. Yeah,</v>

111
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.810
but they're in, um, they're little balls and they have a little faces.

112
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.350
<v 0>Nolan hagfish look like they're fish, but they're like little eels. Yeah.</v>

113
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.390
<v 2>No, these are balls, baby. I don't like those. It's fine. It's the way the game.</v>

114
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.900
Yeah. They're like little blobby balling. Right.

115
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.650
And they attack you've played it. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. You know about it then.

116
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.220
Right. So, um, they're cute. Right. But when they get angry,

117
00:06:48.221 --> 00:06:51.310
sometimes they change color and they vibrate a little bit different.

118
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.110
And then there's salons with little, um, um, yellow tentacles.

119
00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.500
They're rare and they're black. And if you kill one of those,

120
00:06:59.501 --> 00:07:04.450
you'll get like shoes or like some sort of like, um,

121
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:05.343
a weapon.

122
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.490
<v 3>Wow. That'd be nice if we could hunt. And then when you kill an animal,</v>

123
00:07:09.491 --> 00:07:11.330
it's not just the meat, but you get it.

124
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.890
<v 2>Golden goose. Yeah. Yeah. The new slides, you know what I mean?</v>

125
00:07:14.891 --> 00:07:19.870
The spring edition that'd be nice or Montclair jacket. That's nice. Thanks.

126
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.290
Um, so how far did you get, did you get, ever get to the desert?

127
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.350
<v 3>Um, yeah, I think that's, as far as I got the desert that's up North.</v>

128
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:32.140
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. Thank you for exactly. So the desert has the best mine there. Right.</v>

129
00:07:32.141 --> 00:07:36.700
And it's, um, there's also these, um, all kinds of little creatures in there,

130
00:07:36.701 --> 00:07:39.850
but, um, they're hard to make, so anyway, that's how I can count.

131
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:40.931
<v 3>Hey guys,</v>

132
00:07:40.931 --> 00:07:43.780
we're going to take a really quick break to share some of our like favorite

133
00:07:43.781 --> 00:07:44.590
sponsors with you.
