00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.070
<v 0>You're so funny. And I realized, I like, that's so.</v>

2
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.870
<v 1>Hard to find. Cause I, you know, if I were in college,</v>

3
00:00:08.871 --> 00:00:12.570
I feel like it would be a little bit easier, but I'm going full,

4
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:16.110
full blown into music. So, um, I,

5
00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:20.480
I miss it so much just being able to have that many

6
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.220
musicians at your fingertips and just is so nice.

7
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.900
<v 2>Um, when your relationship with your coaches,</v>

8
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.580
are they really like checking in every day? Or is that just when the TV see,

9
00:00:34.581 --> 00:00:37.070
this is an NDA.

10
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.710
<v 0>I'm worried about that. No, don't worry if don't work away around,</v>

11
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.660
but I want to say, I know you don't know how bad I want to talk about

12
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.433
[inaudible].

13
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.420
<v 2>Yeah. Okay. We always assume everything is done for the camera, right? Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.283
Correct. Babe.

15
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.250
We assume that the only time that the coaches get in contact with you at the

16
00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:02.780
time when the cameras are on that,

17
00:01:02.781 --> 00:01:06.830
there really is no true interpersonal relationship where they're like,

18
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.130
I'm going to foster. I'm really going to help this kid grow into the artist.

19
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.010
<v 0>Well, no, I will say this. I will say this.</v>

20
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.300
<v 1>There are times when that does happen. Okay.</v>

21
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.590
<v 0>There are, there are. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know.</v>

22
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.860
<v 2>No, you don't have to confirm nor deny. We're just telling you what. Yeah, yeah,</v>

23
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.510
yeah.

24
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.150
<v 0>But there's no way that the positive, positive.</v>

25
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.243
<v 2>Positive.</v>

26
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.210
<v 0>But like, um, you know, I know this is not happening.</v>

27
00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:39.080
You wake up and Blake Shelton is texting you, going, you ready today, boy.

28
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.820
Right? You're like, nah, bro. You know that part of the bridge,

29
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.050
I still don't have my falsetto. Right. And Blake's going,

30
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.600
I'll be ready that boy, get some warm,

31
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.760
clean lungs and get it or whatever that doesn't happen.

32
00:01:55.761 --> 00:02:00.380
Right. He doesn't text you confirm or deny nor deny. Here's another thing.

33
00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:04.300
Right? Um, another thing. Yeah. Another thing is,

34
00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:09.200
is that I feel like some coaches are better than others. Like for me,

35
00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:13.520
I think that Kelly Clarkson, although she wasn't on your year, Kelly Clarkson,

36
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.520
I feel like it was a good coach. I feel like she would actually call her.

37
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:18.190
I think she calls. I think she calls.

38
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.660
<v 1>Well, I can say this Miley Cyrus.</v>

39
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.820
I feel like she does all over it all over every single person on her team was

40
00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:28.880
like taken care of. She had emails sending back.

41
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.610
<v 2>That's why with Jess Freeman on your season was</v>

42
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.260
insane. Passed away just recently.

43
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.020
<v 0>Why did you bring that up? I know I got all sad bumps on my body.</v>

44
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.430
Okay. What other assumptions? Janice freemen. Okay.

45
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.350
Not only incredible. One of our favorites, um,

46
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.520
just to win in my opinion, don't make me cry right now. 100%. No.

47
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.100
If you're going.

48
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.690
<v 1>Based off of talent alone,</v>

49
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.800
but there's a whole backside to her just as a person just hanging out with her,

50
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.730
just meeting her. She is so freaking powerful. Like it's a,

51
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.310
it's an energy. It's not even just like the way she like talks.

52
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.250
And I'm not saying this just to, just to say it like for real,

53
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:21.580
it's like you can ask anybody that, that knew her. She was.

54
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:22.111
<v 0>Well,</v>

55
00:03:22.111 --> 00:03:26.820
here's how I know the reason how I know why she was powerful and a nice person.

56
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.930
Is that because Miley, when Jen has passed away.
