1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.380
<v 0>I want to know what you would take.</v>

2
00:00:01.381 --> 00:00:04.440
Like if there was a fire raging through this home,

3
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.550
what are the absolute necessities that you would that are very dear to your

4
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:09.384
heart, that you like to?

5
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.710
<v 1>How much time do you have much time? Oh,</v>

6
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.930
I wake up right at first.

7
00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:22.640
These two, because you're branding branding. No, no, no. It's not that,

8
00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:26.150
it's just that because, um, I just liked them a lot. Okay.

9
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.030
They have sentimental value. They have sentimental belts.

10
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.800
I put the Gucci glasses on, you know what I mean?

11
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.320
Because I like them all to protect your eyes from the heat. Right.

12
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.300
I would have to get clothes on because I don't want to be on fire and running on

13
00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:41.720
the street naked. Right. So I would get like my favorite pair of, um,

14
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.830
raw denims. I would get my favorite pair of golden goose shoes. Okay.

15
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.870
You know what I mean? I would probably take about 10 shirts.

16
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.060
<v 0>Jules and I are still asleep at this point. Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.320
<v 1>But this is what I'm doing because I want to,</v>

18
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.870
because I know what you're going to do. If I wake you up,

19
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.500
I have to do what you want to do. So I got to do my, take the animals.

20
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.280
I want to do that. I want to do that. I want to do it,

21
00:01:01.281 --> 00:01:04.250
but let me just do forgot about the animal. Look it out angry. She is.

22
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.780
Are you angry?

23
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.600
<v 0>No, go ahead. I want to know your soul, bury your soul,</v>

24
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.910
who you really are.

25
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.180
<v 1>First of all, shirts, golden goose. But also this is,</v>

26
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.620
this is only going to take 40 seconds. Mind you okay.

27
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.920
Getting the shirt? I don't mean. Okay. All right. So you know,

28
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.690
I have another amendment then. Okay. So, um, okay. A minute pass.

29
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.070
I have my glasses on. I have all my clothes on, right? Yeah. And then sweetie,

30
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.150
and you'll wake up. I go fire,

31
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.020
question Mark. Right?

32
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.330
And then you'd wake Juul up. Right?

33
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.190
And then the next four minutes is the four months of hell. Yeah.

34
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.140
Is trying to wrangle the animals. The cats, the cats are the hardest. Right?

35
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.000
Um, I might leave one of them. I'm sorry. I have to, I have to.

36
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.820
<v 0>No way. I already have a contingency plan for this stuff. Right. I practice.</v>

37
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.040
I do. I run drills at home.

38
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.950
<v 1>Yeah. She's like Ben still in the movie. The Royal Tenenbaums.</v>

39
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.210
<v 0>I am. That's exactly who I am actually. So like, I run like drills in my head.</v>

40
00:02:14.211 --> 00:02:18.350
Like I know exactly where their crates are, like where to corner Mike,

41
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.750
because cats get spooked. And when they, when they're spooked,

42
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.920
it doesn't matter if they love you, they'll just want to bolt. So I know.

43
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.020
Or all their crates are, I don't have one crate. I have three crates.

44
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.570
<v 1>It does. But the cats in the dogs, all right. Now we have five minutes left.</v>

45
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.100
What did we do? Okay.

46
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.990
<v 0>Um, w I'm asking you, like,</v>

47
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:41.420
what are things in this home that you absolutely value.

48
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:43.970
<v 1>But the human beings.</v>

49
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.100
<v 0>Besides the human beings in the animals now.</v>

50
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.510
<v 1>Okay. Aside from that. Okay. Then I would probably go, um, you got four minutes.</v>

51
00:02:50.511 --> 00:02:54.500
I need my phone to my iPad. Okay, good, good. Yeah. Got to get that. Um,

52
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.430
I need my cigarettes. I'll talk to, I spoke to a day,

53
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.780
but I just need it because it's stressful. You can buy those. I don't have,

54
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.380
it doesn't matter. I need, you know what I mean? And if I can't find my lighter,

55
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:09.880
I'll just use the house, fire, stick a cigarette.

56
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.180
And then, um, that would get that. And then, um,

57
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.210
other than that, I think that's it. I'm out of the house. iPad. The humans,

58
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.500
the animals, right? My favorite clothes. My, yeah, my wallet.

59
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.560
That's it. And then I would be out of the house.

60
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:33.430
I have five minutes to spare and then I would call, what do you call? Nine one,

61
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.810
one or four? One, one. What do you do? You call for a call for one, one, right?

62
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:42.280
And go, you know what I mean? Hello, fire, fire,

63
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.340
fire, fire. Fire. Yeah. Oh, I'd probably wake up the neighbors.

64
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.680
<v 0>How are you? How are you going to wake up our neighbor to the left, Joe? Yeah.</v>

65
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.350
<v 1>I would go knock on his door. Ah, not, probably not. Yeah. Probably not.</v>

66
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.210
I wouldn't, I wouldn't wake up the neighbors. I,

67
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.030
they should know they should smell the smoke. Yeah. Yeah.

68
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.200
And then we would probably back the car out of the driveway a little bit. Yeah.

69
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.460
Get all everything in there.

70
00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:11.490
And then we would go to like a four seasons or something or motel six, actually,

71
00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:14.890
one thing I'm surprised she didn't take what I'm going to say.

72
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.960
I'm not going to say it's right next to you. Like there's no time to play,

73
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.610
dude. Right next to you.

74
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.460
<v 0>Your father's ashes, babe.</v>

75
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.780
<v 1>There's no pretended to play on my PlayStation. I could go to the next day.</v>

76
00:04:30.781 --> 00:04:34.380
I can go to best buy and go buy a whole new set up to.

77
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.480
<v 0>Be fair though. That's already been burned.</v>

78
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.200
<v 1>Yeah, just right here. I have no idea. I'm going to say this. Okay.</v>

79
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.880
It's a real, this is a symbol.

80
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.840
I have no idea. What's in here. You're going to let him die twice.

81
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.273
You know what I mean? Is there

82
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.403
[inaudible] what if my dad didn't have a

83
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.230
[inaudible] yeah, yeah. Um, yeah, I probably, I w I do this,

84
00:05:04.231 --> 00:05:08.220
wouldn't be in my forefront of my mind is he's already passed, you know, this,

85
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.780
to me, this is just a symbol, but, um, if I had time, maybe I would grab that,

86
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.330
you know, and maybe that tiger belly, neon sign.

87
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.260
I like that. Other than that, you know, it would be sad because you know,

88
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.380
a lot of these, um, all these little things,

89
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.980
that's on the walls and in these cupboards and all that stuff are things I've

90
00:05:28.981 --> 00:05:32.010
collected over the years. And they have, you know, I'm not a hoarder,

91
00:05:32.011 --> 00:05:34.260
but I have deep, um, you know,

92
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.910
emotional attachment to a lot of things because of memories and whatnot,

93
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.440
you know? Um, so it would be really a sad thing if we were in a fire. Yeah.

94
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.160
Yeah.

95
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.600
<v 0>He does with, with me, like, I don't hold a single value.</v>

96
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.310
Can you guys believe this nice single valuable piece of jewelry except for

97
00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:54.570
Bobby's, um, drug ring.

98
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.070
<v 1>Yeah. She has my drug ring. Where is it? I haven't it. Oh, I have it.</v>

99
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.290
<v 0>Yeah. I keep it nice and secure, but I'm just saying, besides that,</v>

100
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.850
cause I don't wear fancy jewelry at all. Like I don't own a single,

101
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:10.880
like gold, anything. Nothing. Yep.
