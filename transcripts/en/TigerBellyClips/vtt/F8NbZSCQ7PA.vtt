00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.990
<v 0>All right. So what do we do at the end? We have,</v>

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.420
here's what we do at the end of the thing is we do something called unhelpful

3
00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:10.830
advice. Okay. And they ask a question and then we have to answer it. All right.

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.010
Can you do it? Thank you. Okay. He has to do a thing though.

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.680
<v 1>And what's going on there?</v>

6
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.230
<v 2>Oh, helpful advice with Bobby Khalilah at, uh,</v>

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.790
you know, y'all.

8
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.530
<v 1>That was a remix. Most people like it.</v>

9
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.450
<v 2>St. Queen and Prince and court jester. A few years ago,</v>

10
00:00:32.451 --> 00:00:35.120
I was lost and doing nothing with my life. However,

11
00:00:35.121 --> 00:00:37.010
my girlfriend helped set me on the right path.

12
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.730
And now I have a rewarding career in software development. Most, if not all,

13
00:00:40.731 --> 00:00:44.810
all of my sets, I owe my hard work and perseverance to her.

14
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.930
My question is how can I help her set her on the right path?

15
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.650
She's unhappy with her current job. And it seems like she's got one or two good,

16
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.150
but risky options to get out,

17
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.610
but has yet to really make a move on them and is unsure.

18
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.200
I'm feeling terrible that I can't help her out. What do I do Carlo from Canada?

19
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.020
<v 3>Uh, that was what?</v>

20
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.680
<v 1>How does.</v>

21
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.230
<v 3>He, okay. The question is the girlfriend set him up on a good path.</v>

22
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.560
She was there for him. So how does he return? How does he leave her? Um,

23
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.790
he wants to return the favor or Levi's setting her up.

24
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.220
<v 2>No, he wants to, uh, he wants to do the same thing for.</v>

25
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.470
<v 3>Her too. He wants to get her a good.</v>

26
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.780
<v 2>Job or on the right path. Yeah. Follow her dreams.</v>

27
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.890
<v 3>Essentially. Yeah. That's like the hardest thing you could ever buy for someone.</v>

28
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.190
<v 0>Yeah. Well, first of all, we don't even know what her dreams are.</v>

29
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.260
<v 3>You can put a blindfold on and then just make sure that she's walking the right</v>

30
00:01:36.261 --> 00:01:36.470
way.

31
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.050
<v 2>Say it's risky. So it's probably like, not a normal nine to five.</v>

32
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.130
So if she isn't there.

33
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.110
<v 3>You mean a risky, like a coal miner kind of situation.</v>

34
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.090
<v 0>I want to say something right now. Could I stand, stand, stand up,</v>

35
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.700
whatever she wants to do. You should always support that. Right.

36
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.560
So I don't know what her dream is, but yeah. I don't know specifics,

37
00:01:57.561 --> 00:02:00.350
but you should try to help her make it. Yeah.

38
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.360
<v 3>I think all women need is just to be told that you can it's okay.</v>

39
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.400
We support you. Yeah. That's all only need for men.

40
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.230
There's a second question here. This one's a good one.

41
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.970
<v 0>Can I just say something real quick though?</v>

42
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.980
I've been really getting into X-Factor and I've been really getting into this

43
00:02:15.981 --> 00:02:19.040
lady by the name of Sam Bailey. She won the whole thing 2013.

44
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.330
And when she auditioned, right,

45
00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:27.950
she was like this like frumpy white lady who just had kids and a wife.

46
00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:32.270
She likes soccer and she's like, I think I'm too old. But um, you know,

47
00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:37.160
I have to try she's British and she won the whole thing. She's so gifted.

48
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.940
There you go. Wait.

49
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.130
<v 3>Is that one, the one that you make you eat bugs and stuff? No.</v>

50
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.160
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

51
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.570
<v 0>She does a singing competition and she won the whole thing. But when,</v>

52
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.490
whenever I look at that clip in the beginning,

53
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.240
[inaudible].

54
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.140
<v 1>Ugly. Susan Boyle road rode through and everyone thought she was, you know,</v>

55
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:17.440
Susan was not even that lit. What do you mean? She's not,

56
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:21.400
I don't think she's like that. And she didn't blow me away, but you know, why?

57
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.360
Why? Because she looked like.

58
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.410
<v 0>No, because, well, let me say.</v>

59
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.660
<v 1>This right now. If she didn't look like that and.</v>

60
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.190
<v 0>She looked like, she looked like just a regular 20 or two year old girl,</v>

61
00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:35.070
hip girl, she would have been, she wouldn't have made it.

62
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.070
<v 1>Yeah. She went [inaudible].</v>

63
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.390
<v 0>When she came out of that stage, people laughed in the audience and they, they,</v>

64
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.970
you know, and then she came out and did that.

65
00:03:44.971 --> 00:03:48.570
I think that had a lot to do with their, her look. But this girl, Sam Bailey,

66
00:03:48.571 --> 00:03:51.870
I'm talking about, isn't like that she's legitimately talented.

67
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.390
But when she said I have to try,

68
00:03:54.391 --> 00:03:59.190
it makes me cry because in life you always have to try.

69
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.130
Yeah. And that's tonight's message.

70
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.640
Give second question. Second question. Go ahead.

71
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.660
<v 1>Me and my.</v>
