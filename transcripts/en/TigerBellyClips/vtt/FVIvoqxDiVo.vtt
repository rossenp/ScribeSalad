1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.330
<v 0>Yeah. I never thought about having kids, you know, I mean, but uh, years ago,</v>

2
00:00:03.331 --> 00:00:07.290
Al magical invited me to his house and I had dinner with his kids and his wife,

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:08.670
and it was proper.

4
00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:13.140
We put the thing on the thing and then the utensils that was nice candles,

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.440
you know what I mean? It was real nice. You cut things, you know what I mean?

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.480
And you're very proper, but you just,

7
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:23.310
you could see just the relationship with Al's kids are wonderful kids and him

8
00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:26.860
and I thought, Hmm, maybe I want to have a baby, but I have it.

9
00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:29.010
This is going to cook a go to you now, uh,

10
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.660
I saw you at a party once with your daughter and you were playing soccer with

11
00:00:33.661 --> 00:00:38.460
her on a field. Right. And I, I'm sorry. I mean,

12
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.870
you just never, I never, never imagined you playing with children.

13
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.790
<v 1>I'm glad you didn't the way you just put</v>

14
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.450
it in terms of like.

15
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.170
<v 0>It wasn't like you frolicking, you don't look,</v>

16
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.350
you don't look like somebody that would frolic frolic or like, you know,

17
00:00:57.351 --> 00:01:00.770
me being in a, you know, just, just in wheat, in wheat.

18
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.400
<v 1>No, I'm just saying, you know what I mean? It says he brought it up,</v>

19
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.540
he got uncomfortable. So he's trying to make me uncomfortable, uncomfortable.

20
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.560
<v 0>Just, you know, we'd never see you, you know,</v>

21
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.800
I mean with butterflies and running through a field, but right. But w I,

22
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.480
I was watching you and I, you know.

23
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.250
<v 1>Were you on mushrooms when</v>

24
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.290
I was just running in slow motion, I would just look at you.

25
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.650
<v 0>And you had such, you love your daughter so much. You were playing and,</v>

26
00:01:30.651 --> 00:01:33.470
you know, I mean, she would slip and you would giggle and you were like,

27
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.480
and I thought to myself, I think I want a kid. You know what I mean?

28
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.890
Cause that just seems fun. And it seems like Bill's having fun. Fun,

29
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.580
right? It's it's, it's, it's a life-changer correct.

30
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.480
<v 1>Yeah. And, and, and, and whatever you have, whoever the parent is,</v>

31
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:54.290
that's the opposite sex. They get a little bit more because like, if,

32
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.830
cause it's like, if, if you guys have a daughter, right,

33
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.220
she's going to be the disciplinary and she's going to be seen through all your

34
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.090
daughter's go. And she's, she's totally manipulating you. Right. A blah.

35
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.920
And you're going to be a puddle of mush. Right. And then she's like, Oh my God,

36
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:12.980
I feel like the bad guy, but then you have a son and then it flips.

37
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.510
And then it's just like, you know, you know, you're going to be like, Oh my God,

38
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:20.750
my little man and blah, it'd be like that. Yeah.

39
00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:25.640
And then you're going to be all like, yeah, let him do that to you.

40
00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:28.430
He's one of those things. But like, no,

41
00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:32.960
I'm all in with my, yeah. I know. I, you know, if you saw some of the,

42
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.223
like what.

43
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.810
<v 0>Like paint, like you do pottery stuff.</v>

44
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.010
<v 1>And paint. Oh, I'm beyond like, what do you do? I can,</v>

45
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.870
I can do her hair. I can like, I can do, I can French braid. I can do the whole,

46
00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:49.400
I can get her. Cause I had this,

47
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.720
this horrible feeling that one day my wife wasn't going to be there.

48
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.900
And she was going to have to go to school with their hair,

49
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.370
not looking the way she wanted.

50
00:02:58.371 --> 00:03:03.280
And I going to school every day with orange hair. What the that was like,

51
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.340
so I remember that. So I was just like, I'm gonna make sure that,

52
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.380
that you you're,

53
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.170
you're looking all right now I'm like totally into it's crazy because now,

54
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:14.980
like I see in like women, like in movies and stuff,

55
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:16.360
and I'm looking at their hair trying to figure it out.

56
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.400
[inaudible] yeah. I bet you, you didn't do this. I don't know.

57
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.420
I'm not at your house.

58
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.050
<v 0>Um, do you watch programs with her? Like, like.</v>

59
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.520
<v 1>Hey listen, the best thing is, uh, I got she's into bugs bunny.</v>

60
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.790
Oh wow. Classic. But you got to watch out.

61
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.880
Cause there is some old school bugs bunny.

62
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.630
They got a little bit of black face in there and they got a little bit of, uh,

63
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.030
we, we, we were, we were, you know,

64
00:03:45.031 --> 00:03:49.050
at war with Japan. So there's some,

65
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.470
there's some war propaganda. It's kind of funny when they do it to the Germans.

66
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.300
Cause it's white on white, but the other way it gets a little crazy.

67
00:03:54.301 --> 00:03:58.560
But if you stay with the mainstream ones, it's fine. And what's,

68
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.590
what's awesome. Is, uh, we got,

69
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.360
we got in an argument about bugs bunny is she's

70
00:04:06.361 --> 00:04:10.950
convinced that Elmer Fudd, his name is doc. Cause he says what's up doc?

71
00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:14.430
And I'm like, no, that's just what he said. His name's Elmer fudge phone. No,

72
00:04:14.431 --> 00:04:18.000
his name is doc. I was going like, no it's Elmer Fudd.

73
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:21.960
And she got really upset. And so I just, all right, it's dark. It's dark.

74
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.920
So I have to wait until she's emotionally ready. What does that some of the, uh,

75
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.320
Japanese propaganda. Oh, Oh, that isn't bad. Yeah. It's classic.

76
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.590
No, no, no, no. There there's. There's worse than that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

77
00:04:34.591 --> 00:04:37.770
There's definitely, uh, I mean the eyes don't seem that slow.

78
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.660
That's not a good example. Yeah.

79
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.560
It's just every once in a while and there's like little subtle things, right.

80
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.030
The swans versus the ducks, ah, like that,

81
00:04:48.031 --> 00:04:51.360
where it's real subtle and you just kind of set the gun. Like

82
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.440
I don't like it. Yeah. Then I just defer to my wife and she would look at me.

83
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.310
Do you want more or no? Oh man. I, I would, if I didn't start solely,

84
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.150
I would definitely have more. But um, I think we're good. We've got one of each.

85
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.570
<v 0>Sweetie. I'm telling you right now. Okay. Let me just,</v>

86
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.530
let me just say something. Okay. In front of bill. Yeah. In front of bill.

87
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.640
All right. I think I'm ready.

88
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.790
<v 1>Wonderful. Okay. Congratulations.</v>

89
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.620
<v 0>Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'm a man of change. Okay.</v>

90
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.330
I've changed a lot of things about myself. Okay. And I'm healing, you know,

91
00:05:27.331 --> 00:05:30.420
a lot of the trauma stuff, all that stuff. I'm trying to heal it up.

92
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.320
I think I'm, let's just sorry. I think I, I think I please,

93
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.060
I think I can have one. All right. So just all right, good. Anyway,

94
00:05:39.061 --> 00:05:40.800
at the end of the, okay. Just think about it.

95
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.023
<v 1>At the end.</v>

96
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.840
I just loved all of the body language in all of them. He's pointing that way.

97
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.960
He does this a lot. Like if he wasn't already,

98
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.130
I would probably have had six children by now. But because feel like he's.

99
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.050
<v 2>Like six children in one human Panda. It's you know?</v>

100
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.180
<v 1>Yeah. I do do that. I gotta, you gotta,</v>

101
00:06:07.181 --> 00:06:11.440
you gotta like gotta tell me, well, you say you throw yourself into things.

102
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.450
Yeah. If you have a kid, you have to do that.

103
00:06:13.451 --> 00:06:16.870
That's not something that you can kind of be into for a minute. Bill.

104
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.460
<v 2>Uh, during our couples counseling, he was like, yeah, like if she's,</v>

105
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.980
when she's pregnant, I'm just going to take more road dates.

106
00:06:23.981 --> 00:06:26.230
And when the baby's born, it's a joke.

107
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.700
<v 1>Joke in the couple of no, but if she, she, if she's pregnant,</v>

108
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.380
like in the beginning, when you're fine and everything you can, yeah.

109
00:06:35.381 --> 00:06:38.500
You got to stockpile the money. That's what I'm pushing for the

110
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.900
cut the nuts during the summer for the winter. No, it's a good move.

111
00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:46.720
And then the two months after, you know, like the month before,

112
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.830
and then the two months after I'm there, you stay in town and then,

113
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:55.120
then you just do quick hits after that. Right. See, there we go.

114
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.720
And I don't care if you, you know, you get hit a night nurse. Yeah.

115
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.510
We're gonna get a night nurse, babe. Yes. Sell everything in this garage.

116
00:07:01.511 --> 00:07:06.490
If you have night, Kevin Nealon said that what? Get a night nurse.

117
00:07:06.491 --> 00:07:09.040
You have to take a second mortgage. Get a night. No, it's,

118
00:07:09.041 --> 00:07:13.600
it's that whole idea of just doing it by yourself? Yes. Is,

119
00:07:13.601 --> 00:07:17.920
is the, it's a, it's a long, no it's Butler thing. All right. Well

120
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.030
that it's, it's not like the old school.

121
00:07:22.031 --> 00:07:25.750
That's the new school way that people tried for 30 years that failed

122
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:30.190
horrifically because everybody else it's just like, you know, um,
