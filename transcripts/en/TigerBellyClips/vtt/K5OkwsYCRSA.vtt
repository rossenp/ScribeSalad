00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.360
<v 0>It's that old boy right behind you. Yeah. Oh my God, dude.</v>

2
00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:06.150
I got a horror movie for people at home.

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.950
He told me about this movie like 10 years ago and I that one and then the

4
00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:12.300
audition. Yeah.

5
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.030
<v 1>Oh, well, I, I, you invited me to your birthday party one time. Yes. And, uh,</v>

6
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.270
I brought you the DVD of old boy as a gift. Yes you did. Yeah.

7
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.370
And I told her to watch it and.

8
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.500
<v 0>Freaked me out. And I actually, one of the most amazing scenes I've ever seen,</v>

9
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.660
the way that they shot the, uh, the,

10
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:35.180
the main character is got a whole hallway of people that he has to fight.

11
00:00:35.181 --> 00:00:38.060
So they built this hallway amazing. And they,

12
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.980
they cut out the wall and just had this guy and they just all a one shot

13
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.790
of them going to everybody talks about like the Scorsese, you know,

14
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.570
Goodfellow shot that amazing. When we goes in, this is basically that with like,

15
00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:55.160
he's also fighting 500 people. And then I saw the audition,

16
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.620
um, and I got into like, you know, Asian horror movies and then like,

17
00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:04.400
but they would just, so they was so beyond what we were doing over here,

18
00:01:04.401 --> 00:01:08.330
I was like, this is like bananas. Yeah. I saw a, really a weird one.

19
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.190
Not necessarily scary, but a weird one on the criterion channel.

20
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.510
I saw there's a movie from horror movie from the early seventies called, uh,

21
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.160
let's scare Jessica to death. No, really?

22
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.040
I swear to God let's scare Jessica to death. Yes.

23
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.630
And I'm telling you not necessarily scary as much as it's. It's weird.

24
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.540
I've got the same. Korean is a Korean. No, no, no.

25
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.490
<v 1>Jessica. Jessica. That's right. Yeah. It wouldn't be Jessica. Yeah. Okay.</v>

26
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.070
Let's scare Jessica to death. It's not scary.

27
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.050
<v 0>It's weird. It could be because here's the thing. What about horror movies?</v>

28
00:01:45.051 --> 00:01:49.820
Why I don't like him is I buy in. I blew it.

29
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.820
That didn't scare me. That scared the out of me. I know me too. Me too.

30
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.810
All of those movies scared the out of me that, uh, um,

31
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.540
that Baba Duke one stop watch. I shut that off. I was like, I can't handle that,

32
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.350
but then I didn't get to see how the thing gets killed. So for like a month,

33
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.880
every time I turn the lights off, I'm hearing Baba dog. I'm just like, yeah.

34
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.700
I'm kind of a, yeah.

35
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.960
<v 1>The scariest one I've seen in the week in Indonesia and one. No, no, no.</v>

36
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.790
The one that I want to recommend them is did you see hereditary, hereditary?

37
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:23.683
Yes.

38
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.040
<v 0>I won't be because if it freaks you out, but that.</v>

39
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.103
<v 1>It.</v>

40
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.150
I've seen it three times since we saw it that first time and I

41
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.320
get so scared. You have to watch it, Billy. Please.

42
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.340
<v 0>Can I ask you a question? Because I don't understand. What is it,</v>

43
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.870
why would you want to feel like,

44
00:02:44.871 --> 00:02:48.590
I hate that feeling like I can watch like a gangster movie, whatever,

45
00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:52.610
but I even watched like casino got to like, yeah, I got a little,

46
00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:55.850
like when he's watching his brother getting, you know, killed, I was just like,

47
00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.010
I'm actually, uh, Chris rock is in the, uh,

48
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.130
Fargo and there's a storyline in it.

49
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:08.000
That's making it on watch as a parent. Yeah. Yeah. Sort of,

50
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.780
uh, I'll trust you with my kid. If you trust me with your kid.

51
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:15.550
Just trying to get through that. Yeah. It's just like, like, I don't know.

52
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:19.480
I get like, why I love movies is cause I, I, if I'm into it,

53
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.800
I am I'm in it.

54
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.010
<v 1>I mean, I can't do rape scenes.</v>

55
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.440
There's this movie called irreversible and there's a 10 minute rape scene in a

56
00:03:28.441 --> 00:03:32.820
tunnel and it's so realistic and literally like

57
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.570
10 seconds in. You're like, all right, I'm out. I'm out. I can't do it. Yeah.

58
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.420
<v 0>It's so cool. I remember when that movie came up. Yeah.</v>

60
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.090
<v 1>Deal. It was a big, it was a controversial.</v>

61
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.950
<v 0>Does it go backwards? It goes backwards.</v>

64
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.520
I've never understood.

65
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.870
I don't understand sex scenes in mainstream Hollywood movies.

66
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.020
I don't understand. Am I now watching a porno
