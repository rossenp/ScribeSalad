00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.520
<v 0>I was about to give you a compliment to Steve.</v>

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.560
I was about to go give you a really good I'll get, do it anyway.

3
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.800
Let me change face. Let me change the face. Okay.

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.930
<v 1>It's so crazy. It's so creepy.</v>

5
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.790
<v 0>Another thing that I love about you, and this is, and you just take it,</v>

6
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.980
just take it. Okay. Is, you know, stand up.

7
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.750
Comedy is something I started with in 1995.

8
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.130
I signed up for open mic. I'd never done anything before acting nothing.

9
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.660
I just walked off the streets and signed up at a open mic in San Diego.

10
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.770
And, um, I started doing it. I worked really,

11
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.810
I went up every night bobbed for years and I got to

12
00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:54.950
a point moved to LA and I did all the Riggleman roll and all the things that you

13
00:00:54.951 --> 00:00:59.900
need to do. And I got to a place where, Oh, I can audition for shows now.

14
00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:03.650
And I got on the tonight show and I did all the things, right. And so, you know,

15
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.090
I feel like I am a organic, you know, stand up

16
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.530
and, you know, as comics, when we talk, right,

17
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.900
we see actors and other people from other fields, right. Crossover,

18
00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:19.220
and do stand up. Right.

19
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.060
And it takes a lot for us to go,

20
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.430
to give that person its rightful credit and go that person's a

21
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.050
standup now because I know thousands of people that actors and other people that

22
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:36.680
have crossed over and I went, that guy. That guy should not be doing it,

23
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.720
but you're the type of standup that you should be doing it because you proved

24
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:43.730
your worth. Well, thanks man.

25
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.320
I'll tell you why I say that it was one night you were at the store or whatever.

26
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.990
You're talking with a bunch of comics. You were hanging out when,

27
00:01:50.991 --> 00:01:54.650
in my head I thought it didn't. I was never,

28
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.430
it was not a question that you shouldn't be there.

29
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.100
You know? I mean, like I looked at you,

30
00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:04.520
like I looked at Whitney Cummings or any of these other people like, Oh cool.

31
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.810
Steve was here, my friend, you know, like a comic. Right. You know, you know,

32
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.090
a long time ago when I saw your staple,

33
00:02:11.091 --> 00:02:15.950
your at the mint right back in the day. Right. I wouldn't even fathom that.

34
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.500
I would even accept that. Like there's a rare case.

35
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:22.460
You are like that obviously Theo Vaughn, cause the avant didn't come from,

36
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:23.690
you know, um,

37
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.610
a standup he had to change or he had to reinvent

38
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:30.920
himself. Right. And you did.

39
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.460
And I knew this also when you invited me and Ian over to your house,

40
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.590
because you were working on your first special to give you notes. And again,

41
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.740
you and I, and I still talk about it, how we respected that,

42
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.000
that you wanted our, you know, notes and your help with your special.

43
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:51.290
It was like, you know, um, I just, you know, my hats off to you,

44
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:52.550
you know, I wasn't,

45
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.520
I was going to see this earlier on the podcast then you attacked me about,

46
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.190
and I literally thought to myself,

47
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.270
I'm not going to even going to this for this face.

48
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.500
Then I just decided to do it anyway, because I really do mean that, man.

49
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:06.723
How do you feel about it?

50
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.100
<v 2>I, I, why I super love you. I super appreciate your kind words.</v>

51
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.530
I really, really do.

52
00:03:13.531 --> 00:03:16.800
I love that you were willing to come over to check out this.

53
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.650
And if I recall correctly, it was like,

54
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.000
I think it was like a week or two weeks before I was actually going to tape the

55
00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:28.920
special. Yeah. And I had you guys come over, I asked you to come over to, uh,

56
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.330
to view like the, the last show I had taped, you know, Oh, what should I do?

57
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.030
And you were like, Hey man, maybe next time one on ship.

58
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.370
Let's do this a little sooner when it's not like next week. Like,

59
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.860
and, and I also remembered too that, uh, I mean,

60
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.870
you'd been very kind because I wasn't ready to take.

61
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.713
<v 0>That's special.</v>

62
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.780
<v 2>Like you wish you hadn't done it. It wasn't that I wished that I hadn't done it.</v>

63
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.590
It was just that, you know, like there were, there was just,

64
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.250
there was a lot that they just, you know,

65
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.200
I mean for where I was at that time, it couldn't have come out any better.

66
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.570
But where I was at that time was very early in the process and here's something

67
00:04:12.571 --> 00:04:14.490
that I had a lot. I have a lot.
