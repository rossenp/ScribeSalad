00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.270
<v 0>Tougher question. What time are we at? 50 something. Okay.</v>

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.600
Barbary con.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.530
<v 1>Loco.</v>

4
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.390
<v 0>This is from our friend. Jago. My name is Jago.</v>

5
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.480
I'm a big fan of the show and you guys are awesome. Here's my situation.

6
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.670
I'm currently in a long distance relationship.

7
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.690
My girlfriend lives in Brazil and I live in the U S we love each other very much

8
00:00:20.691 --> 00:00:21.620
and want to stay together.

9
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.610
Even though sometimes it can be pretty hard because of the distance we see each

10
00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:28.850
other every four months, either she comes to the U S or I go to Brazil.

11
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.610
She plans in, uh, on moving here sometime in the future.

12
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.200
We both are musicians and we're trying to start a music career. Anyway.

13
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.610
I wanted to know if you guys,

14
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.890
if you guys think it's a good idea for us to stay together,

15
00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:42.380
and what are your opinions on long distance relationship?

16
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.800
<v 1>I've been in several long distance relationships. Uh, three,</v>

17
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.670
they don't work for actually. Okay. Um,

18
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.880
it only will work if there is an end goal.

19
00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.260
If you set a date that by September of 2018,

20
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.750
we're going to be together. These are our plans.

21
00:01:02.751 --> 00:01:04.700
If there's an actual plan rolled out,

22
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.690
if I can envision what these two years are going to look like,

23
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.000
then I can really invest in it.

24
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.730
But the reason that my previous ones didn't fail because I dated the

25
00:01:16.731 --> 00:01:21.020
guy in Spain, I would see him once every four months. Same thing. There was no,

26
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.360
he wasn't going to move out here. I wasn't going to move out there.

27
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.400
We liked each other a lot, but at the end of the day, you know, I was still,

28
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.320
you know, in nursing school, I was like, look,

29
00:01:30.321 --> 00:01:32.840
my job's going to be here and you play football.

30
00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:37.340
And so there's no end goal there. And,

31
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.560
but, um, but I mean, I've seen it, you know,

32
00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:45.230
definitely worked for some other people around me.

33
00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:49.610
And that's only because the missing ingredient was, you know, the end date.

34
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.850
When are we going to beat together and set a goal?

35
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.800
<v 0>That's a good one end date. All right, your turn, sir.</v>

36
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.260
How many relationships have you been in long distance?

37
00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.960
Me tell you something right now, my friend. Okay.

38
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.990
The reason why you're in the thing in the first place I'm talking to this guy.

39
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.250
I love you. Thanks for listening to tiger belly. Is, is that this,

40
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.950
the fantasy of her living over there? No, he lives there. I think. Well,

41
00:02:09.951 --> 00:02:12.590
whatever, regardless, it's a goods or a part for different countries.

42
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.060
There is an element of mystery and a fantasy quality to what she lives in

43
00:02:17.061 --> 00:02:20.750
Brazil. He's in us. Right? Okay. So he's like, Oh my God, what, what? You know,

44
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.560
but if you saw each other every day in the same house, right?

45
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.000
It changes the dynamic. You don't, you're not gonna feel the same way you do.

46
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.440
Right. It's kind of like unrequited love in that way where it's like,

47
00:02:33.441 --> 00:02:34.850
there's a fantasy quality to fantasy. Yeah.

48
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.820
<v 1>There is. I will give Bobby back.</v>

49
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.650
<v 0>You see him every day, like her and I, right. I feel so bad for her.</v>

50
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.150
She has to see this. I mean, you don't even know what you, what? I don't,

51
00:02:47.151 --> 00:02:50.870
I haven't washed my hair in what, five weeks. Really? Yeah.

52
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.510
I have foot fungus. It's crazy. Now I gotta put it down.

53
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.140
I have massive flipbook, fungus. You know what I mean?

54
00:02:57.141 --> 00:03:00.520
I'm a disgusting fat slob. And she has to,

55
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.550
and I have the worst character defects and she has to deal with so much.

56
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.370
I'm so sorry, sweetie. But, but you,

57
00:03:06.371 --> 00:03:10.780
don't why I know it's love because she's still in it. Yeah.

58
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.540
And know we're in it. You know what I mean? And I see some of her things,

59
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.020
she had a puffy lips the other day. It was kind of weird.

60
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.860
She gets to these weird zits to these weird zits. Right? Sometimes you,

61
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.660
her principal's a complete salmon.

62
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.670
<v 1>Faster. She probably spilled seven after I, I,</v>

63
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.850
I tell him I just ate salmon. Yeah.

64
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.320
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. He goes, where's those breasts. And then it's like summer,</v>

65
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.290
but some of our health issues, you know, I mean, that's some, you know,

66
00:03:37.291 --> 00:03:40.710
the ambulance comes. Yeah. These are all things that are part of a relationship.

67
00:03:40.711 --> 00:03:45.630
And that's how, I'm how I know. I love her. Okay. We're in the thick of it.

68
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.853
When pick of it.

69
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.250
<v 1>The, the beauty and the reason why I,</v>

70
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.210
I even romanticize my previous relationships that were long distance,

71
00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:58.410
because there is an element of me going to see him in Spain. Oh,

72
00:03:58.411 --> 00:04:02.430
us always spending these three weeks. It felt like a vacation. Yeah.

73
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.000
There was no read. There was a real life aspects of talking about money.

74
00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:08.760
There were no real life aspects of who's going to take the dog out for a.

75
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.840
It was always of, Ooh, I'm in the North of Spain and we're going hiking.

76
00:04:12.841 --> 00:04:16.140
We're taking picnics and you know, we're having sex out and you know, it's like,

77
00:04:16.141 --> 00:04:19.410
it's so fantastic. But yeah.

78
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.380
But, um,

79
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.340
I still think that if you have legitimate feelings for each other,

80
00:04:26.341 --> 00:04:29.640
you should give it a shot, but you should give it a shot in the same place.

81
00:04:29.641 --> 00:04:30.540
At some point.

82
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.270
<v 0>They won't work out. All I'm saying is, is that, that whole fantasy thing.</v>

83
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.880
<v 1>But that's why it lasts so long. And this is always my thing. You know,</v>

84
00:04:38.881 --> 00:04:41.460
I have a friend, we have a friend in common. She's like, yeah,

85
00:04:41.461 --> 00:04:44.610
I've been with this guy for three and a half years. It's like, well,

86
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.870
accumulated,

87
00:04:45.871 --> 00:04:49.920
you've actually only been with him for four months because that's how much time

88
00:04:49.921 --> 00:04:52.830
you've actually spent together in the, in the, in the three and a half years.

89
00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:54.300
So how well do you really know him?

90
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.760
He ended up cheating on her with like multiple women.

91
00:04:56.761 --> 00:04:59.880
B ended up being a really dude. She was like, I can't believe he did this.

92
00:04:59.881 --> 00:05:02.010
I'm like, I can, you didn't know him.

93
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.650
You didn't know him in his day in and day out.

94
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.160
You didn't know what the he smelled. Like from Monday to Monday,

95
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.080
you didn't know the color of his fungus. You didn't know, you know,

96
00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:16.710
the taste of his sweat on a on the fifth day that he didn't shower.

97
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.820
Like you don't know him. I'm talking about you. He's like, wait,

98
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:25.230
this sounds like it's it's it's so it's, it's not,

99
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.160
you have to think of it in terms of, you know, I know there's, you know,

100
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.610
gadgets these days, it's always so much, you know, FaceTime.

101
00:05:32.611 --> 00:05:34.980
You can talk to each other while you take a or whatever.

102
00:05:34.981 --> 00:05:38.760
It's just not the same to be physically in the room with someone is a little bit

103
00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:43.680
different than it kills the romance. It really does.

104
00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:48.270
We've become so functional. Bobby and I, that we're trying, we talk about like,

105
00:05:48.271 --> 00:05:52.650
how do we reignite the feeling of like having

106
00:05:52.651 --> 00:05:56.910
butterflies in your stomach? Cause, I mean, we don't feel that for each other.

107
00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.540
This is functional. It works. We're a team. We're the best.

108
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.370
<v 0>I don't know. I don't know. I just,</v>

109
00:06:02.371 --> 00:06:05.340
the longest relationship I've ever been in and I'm just learning.
