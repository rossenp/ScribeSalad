00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.600
<v 0>When something is escalating and tensions are rising and a table,</v>

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.820
you and Gilbert are so gifted at that where you'll just say one or two things

3
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:10.770
and then everyone's laughing again.

4
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.160
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Come on. We'll move on.</v>

5
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.580
<v 0>Um, but I know you're very good at that. I can't do it.</v>

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.910
I ride the wave of tension. I'm like, Ooh, it's about to blow.

7
00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:21.340
It's about to blow. I'm here for it.

8
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.770
<v 1>You smile a lot more. When I feel you're uncomfortable, use fake smells.</v>

9
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.950
<v 0>This is busy, but you can tell what my fake smile is. It's just like this,</v>

10
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.080
but I also sometimes forget that that's what my listening faces and I

11
00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:38.870
hate it. Cause I've seen myself on camera and then I'm,

12
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.790
I'm trying to really fully listen and try. It's difficult to make me laugh.

13
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.700
That's a problem. Okay. We'll pretend laugh, babe. Like if you're,

14
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.900
if you're reading a scene and then you have to laugh, do you do it?

15
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.533
Can you do it?

16
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.363
<v 2>Of course.</v>

17
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.403
<v 1>You have to do it now.</v>

18
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.880
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

19
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.440
<v 0>Hang on. Hang on. Let me try it. Hold on. It sounds really bad if I try it.</v>

20
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.140
<v 1>No, I think you just, you know, just how you do it.</v>

21
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.700
You think of something that made you laugh.

22
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.800
<v 0>Okay. I'm going to think of your goats. Sounds all right. Uh, hold on, hold on.</v>

23
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:19.790
It's not coming out

24
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.403
right now.

25
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.570
<v 1>You don't do it right now. I feel,</v>

26
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.700
I feel like it's something that's going to disturb me.

27
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.390
It's going to disturb me for life. You do it right now. I'll be honest.

28
00:01:35.391 --> 00:01:40.160
I don't think I've because I do it. You know what she did the other day though,

29
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:44.560
that she did do one and she did a fake laugh that made me laugh. So.

30
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.230
<v 0>No, no, no. That wasn't a fake laugh. He says, what would I do?</v>

31
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.550
<v 1>So what I said was we were in the elevator. I said, what would I do?</v>

32
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.120
What would you do if your son said, you, mom. You know what I mean?

33
00:01:56.121 --> 00:01:59.600
You're a or whatever. What would you? Cause she she'd be strict.

34
00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:03.230
And this is what, so I say that to me, Hey, you, mom, you are.

35
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.820
<v 2>She did that. I need a medicine.</v>

36
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.200
<v 1>Met a sing laugh. Right?</v>

37
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.350
Which made me laugh because it didn't sound like maybe it's not as fun.

38
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.410
<v 0>It wasn't a laugh. It wasn't a laugh. I can't do it.</v>

39
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.963
Have you ever heard of that?

40
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.230
<v 1>No. Cause I've noticed some people will say something funny that you don't know,</v>

41
00:02:21.231 --> 00:02:25.220
you do like just smile and you kind of like, it's kind of like a polite thing.

42
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.730
Yeah. But you don't laugh when you laugh. Maybe you don't laugh, laugh.

43
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.450
Like we laugh. No, you make me laugh. No one on this podcast.

44
00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:34.810
I've seen her laugh. She has. Yeah. She like.

45
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.230
<v 0>I think you're, I think to this day in my whole life, there's no one.</v>

46
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.370
<v 2>Wait.</v>

47
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.450
<v 1>That's okay. So that to me is your real left. Is that fake? Nuts? That's fake.</v>

48
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.320
But I see you do that so many times with it's always faking. I'm always baking.

49
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.150
Yeah. When people, when I do this and I've noticed a bit,

50
00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:58.880
when I've got guests come out and I go,

51
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.220
I put my head up like this and I laugh sometimes. Right.

52
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.700
I'm not laughing, but I will say no,

53
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:08.680
because there's times I've seen you do the head thing,

54
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.870
but then you put your feet up. I know that's real. When you can start with,

55
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.000
it's not real. The feet thing. No, the only time,

56
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.650
the only time I can really really know when I'm laughing is when I did the, uh,

57
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.910
the goat noise. And then when she was laughing and then I started laughing.

58
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:25.840
That was a real laugh dude. Yeah. But don't tell that to the guests.

59
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.230
Cause I'm still going to cut this. No, don't cut this out either,

60
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.520
but that's just a, you know.

61
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.980
<v 0>I think I have to learn this year.</v>

62
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.000
Someone has to teach me how to socially fake laugh because,

63
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.600
and when I don't my face, is this just.

64
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.350
<v 1>Do you, cause then people at least know with you. It's like, Oh, okay.</v>

65
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.300
<v 0>I don't like feeling when people's like,</v>

66
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.210
I don't want anyone to feel that their joke fell flat with me.

67
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.200
Cause then it's just weird. And it happens all the time with me because he,

68
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.510
he has a, such a high level of comedy.

69
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.560
So when I meet everyday people and they try to like be funny around me and I'm

70
00:03:58.561 --> 00:04:03.150
just so stone faced and I'm like, that's not even remotely funny.

71
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.740
That's not remotely funny. I love it. You're a cyborg.

72
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.090
<v 1>Yeah. It's funny. It's when you know, I've, I've hung out with the other day.</v>

73
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.750
I've hung out with San Tino. I hang out with guys, you know, Santinello a lot,

74
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.130
Eric Griffin. He doesn't. Yeah. Eric makes it laugh. Santina really.

75
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.110
<v 0>Makes me laugh though. Makes me laugh. Laughs.</v>

76
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.360
<v 1>Because he's so I love watching Santino talk to other people.</v>

77
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.290
He doesn't give anyone any room to say anything and he just dictates.
