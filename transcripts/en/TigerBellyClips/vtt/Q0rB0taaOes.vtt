1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.170
<v 0>Yeah. I don't understand why you haven't been fired from that.</v>

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.430
Why you weren't fired?

3
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.790
<v 1>I don't understand how I still live with him.</v>

4
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.030
If you think the house smells weird, that's because he us on the balcony.

5
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.750
We are wondering why.

6
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.390
<v 2>You, that it really is a fair, I mean like Baron whole says, like,</v>

7
00:00:17.391 --> 00:00:20.750
I don't understand a lot of people say, I don't understand why she is with me.

8
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.063
Yeah. This is like.

9
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.960
<v 0>Like Donald Trump. Yeah. We don't get why people are voting for you. And</v>

10
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.530
we just don't understand what's happening. Yeah. I don't care.

11
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.110
And you're the dumb public. This look, we like doing it.

12
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.693
Yeah.

13
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.991
<v 1>That's actually,</v>

14
00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:45.650
that's the perfect way to explain it because I don't even think the dump public

15
00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:48.920
knows exactly what they love about him. They can't, they can't.

16
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.080
<v 0>What the problem is you being with Bobby says one,</v>

17
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.220
every guy you've been with before you have a horrible taste in men,

18
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.170
like they must be monsters. Okay. You must've been with like

19
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.280
Satan and then you're just like, Oh, somebody would horrible feet.

20
00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:13.460
That's all. This is like,

21
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.400
if Bobby's like a blessing, man.

22
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.050
<v 1>Now he is only because people,</v>

23
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.150
anybody else that I've dated in the past were just so textbook.

24
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.700
Perfect and boring.

25
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.430
<v 0>You and those girls that were kidnapped for 10 years in Cleveland,</v>

26
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.470
the only ones that would come,

27
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.150
they come back to me kidnapped Bobby. Here's my Prince charming.

28
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.330
<v 1>I like the little bit of unpredictability in my life.</v>

29
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.020
And I like good stories to tell. And in my law,

30
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.440
and I've been in rock long relationships with very normal people in the past.

31
00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:56.330
And I just always found myself bored out of my mind by myself,

32
00:01:56.331 --> 00:01:57.770
like self entertaining.

33
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.140
<v 0>I questioned that I need to see a dossier of like your previous boyfriend.</v>

34
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.990
<v 2>No, she,</v>

35
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.700
the last guy she dated before me was a Spanish professional

36
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.420
soccer player. He's on [inaudible] he's on FIFA.

37
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.060
<v 0>You played with him before? Never. Okay.</v>

38
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.910
So you thought you wanted to be with somebody that wouldn't cheat on you then?

39
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.310
Cause he was cheating on you. Listen, if he's a professional soccer player,

40
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.110
he was getting a lot of horse. Okay.

41
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.120
<v 1>That wasn't something that I was saying. Yeah.</v>

42
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.350
I mean, it's not like.

43
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.150
<v 0>Well, he really was getting a lot of books.</v>

44
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.220
Keep reminding him how much he was getting a lot of books. You understand?

45
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.120
<v 1>I'm not unrealistic. I mean, I was kind of, it, it was,</v>

46
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.220
it was the lasted for a year and a half. That was sorta open. So sorta nod.

47
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.320
But those guys are very like machismo.

48
00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:53.480
So they don't want you to hook up with other people.

49
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.400
<v 2>When I started dating here, they were, he went crazy. Well,</v>

50
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.040
yeah. He goes, is he the guy.

51
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.030
<v 0>From hangover? You really sent that message.</v>

52
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.490
Yeah.

53
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.280
<v 1>No. He thought he said, Khalilah, you are losing your mind.</v>

54
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.300
I think you need to like enter a mental institution because imagine you don't

55
00:03:12.301 --> 00:03:14.160
know who I am at all. Yeah.

56
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.170
<v 0>You're leaving. You're leaving me for this guy.</v>

57
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.370
<v 2>And then you just see a photo of a small fat,</v>

58
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.140
disgusting looking Asian dude.

59
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.750
<v 0>You can, there's probably six more things you could say,</v>

60
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.610
but I totally get it. Yeah. Cause he's like a professional athlete and body look

61
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.020
[inaudible] he can't believe it. And he saw a photo of me.

62
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.870
Can I tell you something? This is the only reason why she did that.

63
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.060
Like at first she didn't really like you,

64
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.360
she just wanted to the biggest you to him ever. Let me see.

65
00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:53.030
Let me find the most disgusting. And then what happened was she was like, yeah,

66
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.053
see something right now.

67
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.180
[inaudible] you grew on her. Like somebody drew you.

68
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.320
I mean, look at your face. Look how offended he got

69
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.070
the ugliest black dude I've ever seen. Anyway, let's move on.

70
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.420
<v 2>So we're doing the podcast. I appreciate it. I'm just doing the podcast.</v>

71
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.990
<v 0>Can you just admit to him that that was, but you know what I mean?</v>

72
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.690
Ask her why she's dating me.

73
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.800
<v 1>We just did. I just answered all the questions.</v>

74
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.830
<v 0>Why she wanted to get back at her professional life</v>

75
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.620
because you grew on her. It's her shadow. This was like,

76
00:04:43.621 --> 00:04:45.840
you know what she said to herself? You know what?

77
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.410
I don't need attractive anymore. Yeah. I don't need tall.

78
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.750
I don't need anybody that can protect me in an alley.

79
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.390
I don't need anybody that could get things off the top shelf.

80
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.730
I don't need anyone that knows how to use a toilet.

81
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.250
<v 1>Yeah. Just say I had surgery four days ago and not</v>

82
00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:09.960
once. Has he so much has taken care of me for an hour? He's imperfect.

83
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.580
<v 2>Well, I would just say this right now. And that's so first of all, I come home.</v>

84
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.380
Right? And there's her mom,

85
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.840
her sister were ex um, guy that she used to see. But then her best friend,

86
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.690
my best friend, Jessica.

87
00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:31.170
<v 0>Oh, you know that ugly Korean girl you just saw earlier. She wasn't that ugly.</v>

88
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.290
Come on, moon, face some moon face.

89
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.420
She was here trying to eat her butt.

90
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.440
<v 1>Yeah. He wants to desperately experiment for them. He's never eaten.</v>

91
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.530
<v 0>It's like, they're like girls spending the night and I'm like, so I slept there.</v>

92
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.850
Slept there. Yeah. So our whole family is here.

93
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.400
<v 1>You've dated a Filipina, you know, just that we come in. It's a lot of family.</v>

94
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.570
And so we were all spread out in the room. They were all taking care of me.

95
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:01.790
So you know how it goes, Eric, I got.

96
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.130
<v 0>Steve's moving in right now. So you're saying.</v>

97
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.630
<v 1>Steve needs to live here. But I think he likes to live like a communist.</v>

98
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.530
<v 0>No, no, no. Steve's a survivor. He's like a Roach.</v>

99
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.980
You could pick him up and put him anywhere and he'll set up base camp.

100
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.370
That's just how he is. He's leaves ready for the zombie apocalypse.

101
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.410
<v 2>A lot. Like my dad, my dad had us,</v>

102
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.850
we lived in San Diego and he had a store in Sacramento. Right.

103
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.740
So he would drive every other week to Sacramento and just stay awake.

104
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.790
What kind of a store? We own clothing stores back in the eighties. Really?

105
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.170
What kind of clothes? It's fashion for women. It was called fashion gal.

106
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.873
Ooh.

107
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.400
<v 0>Yeah. I love it. Did you have to work at the store sometimes? Yeah.</v>

108
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.730
<v 2>God really. My dad and my uncles owned 75 at one point. Wow.</v>

109
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.463
What the?

110
00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.870
<v 0>So what happened to all of that family? Money? Bankrupt.</v>

111
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.250
<v 2>Oh, but so my brother and I, one day go,</v>

112
00:07:03.251 --> 00:07:07.330
we go during the summer, we got dad. We're going to drive up there with you.

113
00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.320
Cause he had been for years, he was driving up there every other week.

114
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.810
It turned out it was a swap meet. I'm not kidding you right now, dude,

115
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.470
we went to this apartment where he lived. Right? No furniture,

116
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.960
not anything, a little like Korean, Matt, no blanket.

117
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.830
Right? And a little like one of those plugin stoves,

118
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.370
that's all that was in there. That's how he was living. He had electricity on.

119
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:32.380
Yeah. He had electricity on, but.

120
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.320
<v 0>Like in retrospect.</v>

121
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.820
<v 2>That's what my brother is. My brother and my mom is the fancy one.</v>

122
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.050
That's where I take, like, she goes, Oh we make Gabby gazebo this summer.

123
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.040
So she made a gazebo.

124
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.490
<v 0>She hired somebody down. We've got a koi fish farm. Like she loves like that.</v>

125
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.710
That's why your dad needed a place. That it was just like,

126
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.900
you know your mom free, you know? Just like, no. Yeah,

127
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.920
no furniture.

128
00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.600
<v 2>But what did it? My dad, because back then my dad didn't he didn't,</v>

129
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.920
he doesn't watch TV. He's not, he's never seen a TV show. Has he seen you on TV?

130
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.000
Yeah. He's been on TV. Oh, Oh yeah. He was on mad TV a bunch of times. Yeah.

131
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.620
He was getting residual checks. She had to sign up for AFTRA. But union sag.

132
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.740
Your dad say he was that's how much we had him on.

133
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.900
But my dad doesn't like music. Wow. He didn't name a Beatles song.

134
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:27.490
I don't know who who's. Bob. Dylan. I don't know.

135
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.130
He doesn't know anything you say who's Tom Hanks. I don't know. He doesn't,

136
00:08:32.131 --> 00:08:33.490
he doesn't know what a movie is.

137
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.400
So he probably didn't even know what he was doing saying is,

138
00:08:36.401 --> 00:08:40.300
is that what the was he doing every night by himself?

139
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.270
In a matte, in an, an like apartment with no furniture.

140
00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.560
All he was checking off like, Oh you think so?

141
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.800
But it's just so sad to think about that. No, he needed it.

142
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:55.360
<v 0>I totally get it. He had these crazy kids, but back then you guys were insane.</v>

143
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.550
You were young. His wife was spending all his money. Yeah, you're right.

144
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.970
Maybe that was it. And then he just needed to go. I find it like a,

145
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.840
like a man cave. You know B.

146
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.770
<v 2>You also could have had things that we don't not even aware of.</v>

147
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.080
Probably has another family. Oh my God.

148
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:13.340
<v 1>What would you do if you found out brothers and sisters?</v>

149
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.200
<v 2>All Koreans look the same anyway. So this could be.</v>

150
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:20.743
<v 0>You look the same.</v>

151
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:28.310
Are you getting that on camera? Yeah, he's got, he's got racism on.

152
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:35.810
Oh, it's loud. And we don't, you know,

153
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.650
that's the only people get here your before the cameras start rolling.

154
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.850
My friend. Let me say something right now.

155
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.530
<v 2>Which stereotypes w you know, that serotype Asian people look alike. Yeah.</v>

156
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.393
Do we?

157
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.930
<v 0>Yes. But how many,</v>

158
00:09:53.931 --> 00:09:58.820
you know, like, so what I'm saying? Oh, well, all right, dude.

159
00:09:58.821 --> 00:10:02.510
So have you been to the airport? Walk by an Asian guy? Is that Bobby?

160
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.800
You thought that one time or you being real? I was

161
00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.590
like Bobby. Oh. Oh really? And it was like a little grandma,

162
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.390
same body shape. You know what I mean? But I'm saying there's a similarity.

163
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.690
There is similarities. That's how you can go. Well, first of all,

164
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:28.430
could you pick a Korean out of a bunch of people? What do you mean?

165
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.370
Like if you saw like a group of people, you could go, Oh, that person's Korean.

166
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.930
You know why?

167
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:36.920
Because there's distinct looking things that are distinctly Korean.

168
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.050
That's why you can go. Oh, that guy's Korean. Yeah.

169
00:10:39.051 --> 00:10:41.750
But I could also go that's Sally, the Korean,

170
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.350
the Korean sometimes all the time.

171
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:50.570
not what if they're all dressed the same? I don't know. Addition still, like,

172
00:10:50.571 --> 00:10:54.710
I've never looked at Steven noon and went Steve. I mean, my brother, you know,

173
00:10:54.711 --> 00:10:58.100
or I never looked at Daniel Dae, Kim, I go, is that sung Kang.

174
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.650
<v 2>Mm mm. Sometimes. Yeah.</v>

175
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:04.790
But definitely you don't look any like any, any black or whatever.

176
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.730
<v 0>Yeah. Or like.</v>

177
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:13.070
<v 1>Do you fight TSA the way he does? Why don't you get TSA pre.</v>

178
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.730
<v 2>I don't have that. Oh, that's because you have to fly the same airline. Okay.</v>

179
00:11:16.731 --> 00:11:17.564
I'm going to do that.

180
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.230
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

181
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:25.400
<v 2>Told me how to treat TSA and I fight them every time.</v>

182
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.440
<v 1>This associated, when we're in the airport,</v>

183
00:11:27.441 --> 00:11:29.630
I go into a completely separate line because I don't even want it.

184
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.030
<v 2>Pretend like, I'll tell you why. Here we go.</v>

185
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.830
You're not a police officer. Yeah. Don't get me started.

186
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.430
And I'm going to say this, all right. This question,

187
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.450
after they see your ticket and your ID,

188
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.470
you'll be like putting your stuff on that little belt thing. Right.

189
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:53.060
And they'll go, some Sam, some stranger will go, where are you going, sir?

190
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:58.180
And I don't answer them. It's none of your business. I know you already saw my.

191
00:11:58.900 --> 00:11:59.830
I'm not answering you.

192
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:04.200
<v 3>All the I had to go through to get to this point. Like, I'm with you. You know,</v>

193
00:12:04.201 --> 00:12:08.520
I don't, Oh, I hate him. I was at a Chicago. And like,

194
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:11.970
so for some reason to align with a little messed up. So they had,

195
00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.880
and the legislature, he was yelling at us, you know, she was like, you know,

196
00:12:14.881 --> 00:12:17.640
y'all got him out, but it just going on and on. And I was like, um,

197
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:24.030
this is a customer service business. Okay. Like w and then there was, luckily,

198
00:12:24.031 --> 00:12:26.520
there was this white guy there in a suit. And he was like,

199
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.910
I need to see this chick manager. So the manager comes over and he,

200
00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.300
and her name was cookie. Of course. I was like, wow, like the show.

201
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.900
And she was just acting up. And I said to the guy, I said,

202
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.630
let's not act like this is the first time you've got a complaint about her

203
00:12:39.631 --> 00:12:43.410
attitude. Okay. And they, you know, he was just like, trying not to be like,

204
00:12:43.411 --> 00:12:47.580
I was like, come on, like, like learn some manners, you know? Like,

205
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:51.750
I feel like that's not a government assigned job. Okay.

206
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.470
You actually filled out an application and was like, I want to do this job.

207
00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.010
And it's like, dude, it's like, they have one application for the post office,

208
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.510
DMV, uh, parking enforcement and TSA.

209
00:13:03.511 --> 00:13:06.810
And then they just assign them because they all had the same ridiculous,

210
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.033
another thing.

211
00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.010
<v 2>Really their fault. Right. It's like,</v>

212
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:16.110
they probably are told all these things about rules and you know how

213
00:13:16.111 --> 00:13:18.480
to look for, you know what I mean, ISIS?

214
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.630
<v 3>I mean, and all these things, a million people go through the airport.</v>

215
00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.740
How many times do you think they'd stop a terrorist? What,

216
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.830
how many times do you think they stop a terrorist at lax?

217
00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.370
Because that will be on the news. We let, we found a terrorist. No,

218
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.780
never has happened out of 10 million people. There's probably one person that.

219
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.570
<v 2>The route they're going to take the next time, because when they did nine,</v>

220
00:13:42.571 --> 00:13:46.230
11 was such a shock because no one had ever really done that before.

221
00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.620
Just steal our planes and use our planes against us,

222
00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:54.570
which I've said this before was a genius. Yeah.

223
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.290
<v 3>Yeah. But not wrong and evil, but not in the worst thing ever,</v>

224
00:13:58.291 --> 00:14:01.920
but not in the long run. And it does. It's not like, like if your eyes,

225
00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:03.360
let me tell you that if ISIS,

226
00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:08.160
this would be the stupidest thing ever if I just did get a bomb and blew up some

227
00:14:08.161 --> 00:14:11.640
city or anything like that, all they would do is poke the bear.

228
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:16.440
And then it would be the only reason why we don't go over there and just ransack

229
00:14:16.441 --> 00:14:20.370
the place as it is, is because we police ourselves. You know, we got the dog,

230
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.100
we got people going, no, we don't want any kids to die.

231
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:26.040
We don't want any families to die. We don't want any soldiers to die.

232
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.140
If they killed hundreds of thousands of people,

233
00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:31.170
all that would mean it would just be, this shouldn't be over like this,

234
00:14:31.171 --> 00:14:34.830
because we would be like, Hiroshima, Nagasaki. Yeah. We don't around.

235
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.990
We don't around when it comes to.

236
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:42.000
<v 2>We did, we, what we did after nine 11, wasn't enough. Let's just,</v>

237
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:44.040
I'm just saying what we did after nine 11,

238
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.520
the response had made no absolute sense.

239
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.280
We took us and be police ourselves.

240
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.390
So I'm not getting what you're saying. So what you're saying right now is,

241
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:58.190
is that if there was even a bigger, like they killed a hundred thousand people,

242
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.460
then what you're saying that our response would be devastating to them.

243
00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:05.110
<v 3>Yes. I don't think so. No, because we would have the, we would have the okay.</v>

244
00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.160
Cause even that.

245
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.950
<v 2>No, but just the, here's the thing though. We had the okay.</v>

246
00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.130
To go into Afghanistan to find Osama bin Laden. Right.

247
00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:16.900
Cause that's what happened. He was in charge of nine 11.

248
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.250
Right. But instead we went into a country. Right.

249
00:15:21.251 --> 00:15:25.090
And then we took out Saddam Hussein who had nothing to do with nine 11.

250
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:29.140
So what I'm saying is, is that regardless of what they do to us,

251
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:32.470
our response is probably going to be,

252
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:34.960
they're not going to make any sense.

253
00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:40.330
<v 3>Look, this is, this is about, about Homeland security.</v>

254
00:15:40.331 --> 00:15:44.200
I'm more conservative than I am liberal. Cause I liken it to like,

255
00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.100
if we're playing basketball on the yard and we're getting serious. Yeah.

256
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.250
There's always a guy that's like, man. Y'all, I'm going to go to my trunk.

257
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.930
You know? And back in the hood,

258
00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.450
that just means this guy's got a gun in his trunk. Right. Okay.

259
00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.760
Now the difference between the liberal and a conservative,

260
00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:02.140
the liberal is going to let him get to the trunk and kill three people and then

261
00:16:02.141 --> 00:16:05.170
do something about it. The conservative is going to be like, uh,

262
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.020
you're not getting to the trunk. We're going to beat your right here.

263
00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:12.040
Now check this out. There may not be a gun in the trunk. Right.

264
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.560
But the action was taken. Yeah.

265
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:17.320
That's the difference between the two conservative.

266
00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:21.910
<v 2>The conservative would go to somebody that had nothing to do with the situation.</v>

267
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.850
<v 3>So now I'm gonna see him was the gun. He was claiming that he had weapons.</v>

268
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.211
<v 2>Isn't a,</v>

269
00:16:28.211 --> 00:16:32.830
why we have ISIS in the first place is because we de stab stabilize that region.

270
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:37.450
There was a civil war. We needed stabilized really to create ISIS.

271
00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:39.700
<v 3>Well, that's just a by-product of.</v>

272
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.420
<v 2>And the worst by-product that we can imagine, Bobby. Yeah.</v>

273
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.900
<v 3>We've been over to that place. We've been over to these places.</v>

274
00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:50.500
They don't know how to treat their own people. They're, it's ridiculous.

275
00:16:50.501 --> 00:16:53.170
Like Egypt should be bulldozed. Okay.

276
00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.600
Like it's like they don't follow traffic law.

277
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.840
They don't follow traffic laws.

278
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.630
Goats get out of buses in the middle of the street.

279
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.433
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

280
00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:07.180
<v 3>Stay in like some of these places,</v>

281
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.510
all the oil money is going to like one family. And they're not,

282
00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.710
they're not helping their own people. Like that. is the thing that money.

283
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.860
<v 2>Well funded. They fund, right. These terrorist activities</v>

284
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:23.920
is that everyone's included. Just listen, everyone's in cahoots. Right.

285
00:17:23.921 --> 00:17:25.210
And I believe right.

286
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:28.930
That if we were attacked our response,

287
00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.630
wouldn't be not my point. I'm trying to make to you,

288
00:17:31.631 --> 00:17:33.190
is this what you're trying to convince me?

289
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.770
<v 3>We were attacked. There would be no,</v>

290
00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.790
w w it would galvanize everybody like it did after nine 11.

291
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.440
What we did was we did something that had nothing to do.

292
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:49.090
Does it matter what extra does it matter? But, but that was still the mandate.

293
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:54.060
Given go do something. What you're saying is what they did. Wasn't proper. Okay.

294
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.870
I'm telling you though. All right. So before that country was like,

295
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.500
ISIS attacks us. Right. We will do something.

296
00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.440
<v 1>Because it's right now, it probably needs you because now you know what?</v>

297
00:18:06.441 --> 00:18:09.020
You need to get China because China and North Korea,

298
00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.130
[inaudible] missing the point. I'm not missing anything.

299
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:16.250
<v 3>Well, I'm telling you if something bad happens,</v>

300
00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.320
the whole country is going to be like, all right,

301
00:18:18.321 --> 00:18:20.510
we're okay with you doing whatever. Like,

302
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.440
we'll need to look at what happened in like, in, the last drop, a bomb on Iran.

303
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.290
If they held him, everyone from Belgium yet.

304
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:29.360
<v 1>I think they did the brothers.</v>

305
00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.340
<v 3>Yeah. Paris, like all these things. It's like when they can't, when,</v>

306
00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.960
when like that happens, those people always end up dead.

307
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:39.830
The first time I've ever seen somebody not end up dead is that guy from the

308
00:18:39.831 --> 00:18:40.880
Boston marathon.

309
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:43.280
<v 1>Usually the cops.</v>

310
00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.710
<v 3>And the government, you know what I call them. They don't around with.</v>

311
00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.520
They just don't around with things like that.

312
00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:55.520
<v 2>No, he's evil. And this is with, right? Because when we're rolling stones,</v>

313
00:18:55.521 --> 00:18:58.460
put them on the cover of the book of magazine and, and you know,

314
00:18:58.461 --> 00:19:00.050
he has women followers. And how.

315
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.600
<v 1>Make them look like a rock star with Jeffrey.</v>

316
00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.950
<v 2>And what does this say? This he's a evil little. And he deserve to die.</v>

317
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:13.790
<v 1>He's cute. A fact. Which one though,</v>

318
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.340
do you think he's cute? You're talking about the younger one.

319
00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:20.600
Not supporting him saying that. Yeah.

320
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.010
<v 3>I'm not saying to anything,</v>

321
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.400
but that's how people are going to misconstrue that if he wasn't a terrorist,

322
00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.850
that's suck. His Dick. Bobby thinks the guy's cute. He said,

323
00:19:28.851 --> 00:19:31.760
he's okay with terrorism. That's what, that's how people will do it.

324
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:33.890
Usually those people end up dead. You know,

325
00:19:33.891 --> 00:19:37.760
when you hear about a shooter or something, the next day, it's like the guy,

326
00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:42.050
the shooter dies every time Colin buying. Am I going to get in trouble?

327
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:46.640
<v 1>That's our knife is cute. No, he has a girl club. He wasn't a terrorist.</v>

328
00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:47.780
This happens all the time.

329
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:54.260
<v 2>Why are you talking about it? Hey man, bro, I'm singing a song in the beginning.</v>

330
00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.740
You don't interrupt me until I introduce you, man.

335
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:23.120
He disappears. It's like a line. Is that Brown line.

336
00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.960
Great character on Charlie Brown. We have right here.

352
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:40.710
Don't load. It's so unorganized. And I'm not sure.

353
00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:45.660
That's the thing in the chaos intern. Yeah.

354
00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.320
This is structured river over here. I don't know what we're doing here.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.300
<v 0>You wouldn't [inaudible] mustache. You have on your</v>

359
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:15.300
[inaudible]. Let me finish. No, I do look like you haven't evolved fully.

360
00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:18.120
You know what I mean? No, this is like right before the, a werewolf movie,

361
00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.280
when a guy goes rotten, you know,

362
00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:26.040
you don't want to shave that or wax it I've tried. And it turns into your.

363
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.820
<v 2>Yeah. Yeah. Oh my God. It's so weird.</v>

364
00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:32.160
I've just noticed that it's really bad because you're such a big guy that

365
00:22:32.161 --> 00:22:35.860
there's just so much to look at. Here we go. So I just, I slowly noticed.

366
00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:40.890
<v 0>Bobby per capita you're way fatter. You know what I mean? It wouldn't mean like,</v>

367
00:22:40.891 --> 00:22:43.350
if you did like the abortion proportionally. Yeah.

368
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:46.140
<v 2>You're just like, okay, see, this is.</v>

369
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:48.900
<v 0>Make fun of me for my dog. Cause this is 1950s dog.</v>

370
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.850
A water hose is going to come out next.

371
00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:59.360
<v 1>But over time she'll know which, uh, which battles to, you know,</v>

372
00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.540
you've got to pick and choose your battles.

373
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.000
<v 2>With battles so she could pick with me.</v>

374
00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:06.150
<v 1>But the video game thing, you don't. How, how long has it been?</v>

375
00:23:06.151 --> 00:23:08.850
Since you've heard anything about the video games, he doesn't play them anymore.

376
00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:14.760
<v 0>Good ones. You got to play in donkey,</v>

377
00:23:14.761 --> 00:23:15.900
Kong and in here.

378
00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:20.190
<v 1>Okay. Do you scream like him when he plays? Yes. No you.</v>

379
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:22.350
<v 0>Don't? No, because I hear you. Okay.</v>

380
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.470
<v 2>Oh my God, baby. He screams louder than me.</v>

381
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.180
<v 0>We're having a great time. I know how much we miss Bobby, but you know what?</v>

382
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:33.120
<v 2>He is a better human being.</v>

383
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:39.790
I can't play destiny with you because I'll tell you why. Okay. I, I,

384
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:43.890
I gain resentment, deep resentment.

385
00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.800
I gain, um, I start like kids, you know?

386
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.080
Cause there's kids I play with on destiny,

387
00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:55.070
them yelling at me and tell me what to do. It was like, literally kind of going,

388
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.120
what the am I doing?

389
00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.380
<v 3>Then when we started playing, it was just you and I, and we were like, Oh,</v>

390
00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:02.920
we got to get somebody else. So we got Steven. And then we got like, Oh,

391
00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.260
that's when Craig came in. We started to get all these people.

392
00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.210
But once we started expanding into like people,

393
00:24:07.211 --> 00:24:08.740
we don't know I'm right there with you.

394
00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.040
<v 0>Yeah. But here's the thing you guys suck. Yeah. But</v>

395
00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.740
did you ever win this one? Really

396
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:25.090
painful client software? I know.

397
00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.980
<v 3>But the fun of it was.</v>

398
00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.600
<v 0>It was the comradery of it, but here's a 6:00 AM in the morning.</v>

399
00:24:33.601 --> 00:24:38.170
We played for seven hours ever been to the lighthouse. No, I'm never going to.

400
00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.600
<v 2>Write. Why? What do you want to live.</v>

401
00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.510
<v 3>Like that? I listen. I totally understand what you're saying.</v>

402
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:48.430
I know I get as equally as frustrated with just game, I'm playing and I'm like,

403
00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.540
they're doing like trials or some. And I'm like, I hate this.

404
00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:53.403
I'm not having fun.

405
00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:57.220
<v 0>Like I'm literally not having fun because there's no way to get better at it.</v>

406
00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.290
Like I don't care. Like I changed controllers,

407
00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:03.250
different guns because I like playing with you guys.

408
00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.630
<v 3>That's what it's all about. Yeah. The Bobby don't you remember?</v>

409
00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:11.770
We became friends because we were in the middle East playing

410
00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.360
X-Box on the road.

411
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:16.900
<v 0>Can you guys find a different interactive game other than destiny,</v>

412
00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:19.750
where they're going to do the screaming and we're going to do a podcast

413
00:25:19.751 --> 00:25:21.180
together. I see that. I see that

414
00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:30.573
[inaudible] but I'm not bitter.

415
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:35.020
I remember we went to all things comedy together. I know

416
00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:40.840
I was in the car when you made the phone call and I told you to go to that

417
00:25:40.841 --> 00:25:44.770
meeting and you didn't the second time around, whatever. Anyway,

418
00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:49.630
it was done as the mix. Did you buy a mic?

419
00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:54.030
Oh see this is okay, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby,

420
00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:57.640
baby. You are the best thing to happen to this guy here.

421
00:25:57.641 --> 00:26:00.700
You guys recognize that him and I, this room,

422
00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:03.400
you think this room would look like this. It would be crazy in here.

423
00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:05.590
We wouldn't even be doing the pocket.

424
00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:10.720
I still think that you guys should do a podcast together. And I've always said,

425
00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:15.090
what's your, what's your pity podcast. Oh, wow.

426
00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.100

427
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:22.563
[inaudible].

428
00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:28.630
<v 2>Listen to me, man. Listen, but you know what? At the end, Eric,</v>

429
00:26:28.631 --> 00:26:32.200
at the end of the day, right? Like, you know, when I first met you,

430
00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:37.570
I'm like who the is this piece of? And I saw you perform in the middle East.

431
00:26:37.571 --> 00:26:39.820
We went to the middle East when Sebastian and I met.

432
00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:44.250
<v 3>And a single tear came down your, your cheek and I no porn.</v>

433
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.020
<v 0>And he couldn't make the crowd laugh.</v>

434
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:51.660
I'm just teasing. He was killing. You know how he is. He just,

435
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.930
he never thinks he can do well. But anyway, um.

436
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:58.040
<v 2>I saw you that years ago,</v>

437
00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:02.270
it was 10 years ago and I saw you go off and I was like this guys,

438
00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:05.690

439
00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:07.880
I'm really just blessed to have you in my life.

440
00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:12.860
You're invited to all of our life events. Should we have, should we have one?

441
00:27:12.861 --> 00:27:15.110
So she's gonna be everywhere. Huh? And congratulations.

442
00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:20.000
Congratulations on the project you have with Pauly shore.

443
00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:20.960
Congratulations on that.

444
00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:26.540
<v 0>Oh, you project, you are so full of. Hate you. Yeah, he's doing.</v>

445
00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:28.910
<v 2>He's going to do a YouTube video with Paula. Paula has come up to.</v>

446
00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:30.800
<v 0>Me three times. I know. I know.</v>

447
00:27:30.801 --> 00:27:33.800
But he's come up to me three times as if we haven't had the conversation

448
00:27:33.801 --> 00:27:37.070
already. I know because he's afraid. He's afraid that he can't get, you know,

449
00:27:37.071 --> 00:27:39.410
he called me. He called me. Yeah. Right. First of all,

450
00:27:39.411 --> 00:27:40.810
I was in a parking lot and he, he,

451
00:27:40.811 --> 00:27:44.930
he like was trying to act like he was mad about him dying up here. He was like,

452
00:27:44.931 --> 00:27:49.210
you know, and I said, Paula, you're not as good of an actor. Yeah.

453
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:51.950
I know you liked the show stop. So he told me about the thing.

454
00:27:51.951 --> 00:27:55.640
Then he emailed me. I said, that was great, dude. I'll do it. I hit up Bobby.

455
00:27:55.641 --> 00:27:58.430
I think Bobby tell me about this thing. And he goes, you have to do it

456
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:04.880
politically. But I still think it's funny with all the people that are anymore.

457
00:28:04.881 --> 00:28:08.270
Isn't it? It's what he does play the political game. No, not,

458
00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:12.110
it's not like he does it. You know what I mean? This guy, South Korea over here.

459
00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:13.760
<v 2>I know. But um,</v>

460
00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:18.560
I see Paulie at the spa and I'm literally getting to the point where it's like,

461
00:28:18.561 --> 00:28:19.940
if I see him, I'm going to avoid him.

462
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:24.710
But he lied because he says Chinese people in a song.

463
00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:29.120
<v 0>So I walk into those Chinese people,</v>

464
00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:34.790
the wonderful people in the world, and there's all these Koreans uncomfortable.

465
00:28:34.791 --> 00:28:37.910
And then he'll walk up to a Korean man. He doesn't know and slap him in the.

466
00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.060
Why would he slap him in the it's crazy? And I go,

467
00:28:41.061 --> 00:28:43.220
you're going to get in trouble. He goes, I never did,

468
00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:46.040
but in Korea they'd kill me. But here we are in a Mac.

469
00:28:46.041 --> 00:28:50.180
I did what the foster, he called me one time.

470
00:28:50.181 --> 00:28:54.560
This was like a couple of years ago to go to the Gordon Ramsey, uh, iron chef,

471
00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:58.250
whatever that definitely does. So we're sitting in like, we're, we're just,

472
00:28:58.251 --> 00:29:00.290
we're eating food, you know? And um,

473
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.850
Polly's getting his food and he goes over to Gordon Ramsey.

474
00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.850
He's not supposed to do this because he's like Gordy,

475
00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.050
Gordy, this isn't cooked. Right.

476
00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.920
And then it comes over to us and I look at the camera and I go,

477
00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.750
you invited Pauly shore.

478
00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:23.480
You thought he was going to sit down and have a pleasant meal? Yeah. Like,

479
00:29:23.481 --> 00:29:24.350
come on, man.

480
00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.380
<v 2>Can I tell you the most embarrassing thing I ever saw him do?</v>

481
00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.100
What's that we were in San Diego and we were at Jamba juice. This is the old,

482
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:34.880
this is when juice. Like there was only Jamba juice.

483
00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.600
They didn't have all the fancy, fancy, good now. Right.

484
00:29:38.601 --> 00:29:39.710
But now it was Jamba juice.

485
00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:44.710
So there was a line out the door and he just cuts to the

486
00:29:44.711 --> 00:29:47.320
front. Right. And poly shad it.

487
00:29:47.321 --> 00:29:51.100
And he cuts and they served them while I waited in line.

488
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:55.660
Actually anyone can do that. But listen, I.

489
00:29:56.430 --> 00:30:00.930
<v 0>Attitude. I'm going to say this right now. Okay.</v>

490
00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:06.300
You literally version of me. All right. Oh no. Not at all.

491
00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:07.493
You don't look like.

492
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:11.903
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

493
00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:17.130
<v 0>Funny and charming. What? Yeah. Yeah. Bobby. I know what I'm saying.</v>

494
00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.660
<v 2>Yeah, you do. Right. And I know what I'm working with and we're the same. No,</v>

495
00:30:21.661 --> 00:30:23.730
not really. Why we pulled blue.

496
00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:27.390
We both played the video games like 12 year olds, but I'm tall.

497
00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:35.610
<v 0>[Inaudible]. Yeah, but that can change that. But I can,</v>

498
00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:40.010
I did three years ago. I know, but I can,

499
00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:44.260
but I can always go back. You're always going to be

500
00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:49.403
so mad.

501
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:53.430
<v 2>I am so angry right now. But the thing is, is that, um, I know,</v>

502
00:30:53.431 --> 00:30:57.690
but I also want to say, this is how I met Eric Griffin.

503
00:30:57.691 --> 00:31:01.140
How I got to know him. How long? Yeah. Okay. So, um, I met our,

504
00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:05.340

506
00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:14.070

507
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:19.290
This is, this is what I'm saying. Okay. I'm not going to, it's a,

508
00:31:19.291 --> 00:31:21.690
it's a gas, it's a gas.

509
00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:26.130
I'm not going to clutch it in and keep it in my body. Will you keep it?

510
00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:27.000
<v 0>Everything else in that box?</v>

511
00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:35.763
[inaudible] yeah.

512
00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:40.680
<v 2>No, I don't know who he is. I mean, I had met him once before.</v>

513
00:31:40.681 --> 00:31:44.310
I did tell him about how I acted during this is so embarrassing.

514
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:49.000
Remember that one show we're on their head the first time we ever met. Yeah.

515
00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:52.440
You got to set this up and I want, you want to say this, right? I don't know.

516
00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:55.080
Was I almost killed? Was I mad TV at the time.

517
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:58.290
<v 0>But I don't even remember, but you were the biggest Dick. Okay.</v>

00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:00.660
<v 2>It tell him what a crazy person. So.</v>

519
00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:02.640
<v 0>First of all, he comes to this show.</v>

520
00:32:02.641 --> 00:32:05.520
We get this great show out in Newport beach. We were paying,

521
00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.480
we were paying comics in the city, a thousand dollars to come do a show.

522
00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:13.500
He comes and he's a nightmare from the beginning to the end,

523
00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.350
like the biggest diva I've ever.

524
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:18.750
<v 2>Met. What I do. You were just.</v>

525
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:23.010

526
00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:24.760
And yeah,

527
00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:27.630
he was just like complaining the whole time about the show where these people

528
00:32:27.631 --> 00:32:31.740
hate me. I don't want to be here. This is ridiculous. How dare you? He was like,

529
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.830
how dare I met a man, booked me in this.

530
00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:39.470
He was going on and on about the show. Just the biggest, worst diva ever.

531
00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:40.010
You know? And I had.

532
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:40.821
<v 3>To call them at like a met,</v>

533
00:32:40.821 --> 00:32:43.220
you need to come down here because I'm about to kill Bobby Lee.

534
00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:44.213
He did not like me.

535
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:49.900
<v 2>But I didn't know who he was. You know? I was like,</v>

536
00:32:49.901 --> 00:32:51.730
I didn't get it hit me. I thought he was the guy from digital loan,

537
00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:56.530
this ugly guy. You know what I mean? You're wearing the glasses. And then,

538
00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:58.300
you know, the junior classes of the nose that they have,

539
00:32:58.301 --> 00:32:59.530
I thought he was wearing one of those things.

540
00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:02.050
You know that the little thing that they do at the thing.

541
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:05.050
So what were you guys' conversations? Do you guys even talk? No, he was like,

00:33:05.051 --> 00:33:09.160
come on, man. Don't act like that. I'm like, you, man. I wasn't, I was a crazy,

543
00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:13.690

545
00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:17.290
<v 3>Oh God don't even get me started.</v>

546
00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:23.410
You don't want to hate about you to this day. It's like, you don't communicate.

547
00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:25.630
<v 1>Properly. Like I have.</v>

548
00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:28.480
<v 3>To text you a thousand times for you to get back to me.</v>

549
00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:33.250
You never answer your phone. Your voicemail is always full. You know? How,

550
00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.500
how does your, do you have another phone? You.

551
00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.830
<v 1>Know how people get in contact? How they have to call you?</v>

552
00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.640
<v 3>The manager and agent have to call you.</v>

553
00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:45.520
<v 1>Alan bilber are having him are having him on a podcast on Wednesday.</v>

554
00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:46.391
They didn't contact him.

555
00:33:46.391 --> 00:33:51.100
They contacted contacted me anything that he had anytime he has to be anywhere

556
00:33:51.101 --> 00:33:53.980
it's through me because he will not.

557
00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:57.640
<v 2>Let me ask you a question. Have you ever heard of Ronan?</v>

558
00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:02.200
Look at me right now. Right now. I'm gonna ask you a question.

559
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:03.303
<v 3>Have you ever</v>

560
00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.670
[inaudible] have you heard of Ronan? Ronan's dry cleaning at best.

561
00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:14.230
<v 2>Right? A master list samurai. All right.</v>

562
00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:18.670
So what I am is I'm wandering through these listening in Japan.

563
00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:22.600
I have a sword and I'm scratching my back and I'm walking through these dirt

564
00:34:22.601 --> 00:34:25.960
like pathways and I'm just a wandering samurai,

565
00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:29.380
just longing for a home. Okay. And that's what I am.

566
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:31.600
You have friends. Okay.

567
00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:35.470
<v 3>They want to be in your life and you want to react.</v>

568
00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:38.340
But it frustrates me when you're asked, don't call.

569
00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:41.950
<v 2>I hate that. That's fine. Because the things that you want,</v>

570
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:45.730
I know what you want. Yeah, you do. No, you don't get back on destiny.

571
00:34:45.731 --> 00:34:46.564
There's a new deal.

572
00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:50.110
<v 1>I will defend him because I see your messages pop up.</v>

573
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:56.350
<v 3>And you get the [inaudible].</v>

574
00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.530
<v 2>He does it a thousand times until I answer. Right.</v>

575
00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:01.240
So I know what you're that's all right.

576
00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:04.390
<v 3>The middle East. Go on. Okay. So then.</v>

577
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:05.770
<v 2>I did that, right. And then,</v>

578
00:35:05.771 --> 00:35:09.850
so I go to the middle East and I would Sebastian who's a dear friend.

579
00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:13.800
And I literally just, we, I saw Eric Griffin perform very,

580
00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:18.490
for the very first time on stage. And I literally watched him and I said,

581
00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.440
this was years ago, like a decade ago, right? No, no. It's.

582
00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.180
<v 3>Not that long ago. It was like five or six years ago.</v>

583
00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.060
<v 2>No, it's of the long run. It's not.</v>

584
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:27.010
<v 3>Because I started in 2003.</v>

585
00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:31.510
<v 2>All right. So five, six years ago. And I saw him for the first time and I said,</v>

586
00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:36.220
this guy is really legitimately funny. Well,

587
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:39.600
and he doesn't look like some, just shut the up out of the story though.

588
00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:42.360
I know we're going to get to that, but you shut the up. All right. All right.

589
00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:46.590
And I literally, cause he doesn't look like he is going to be that funny.

590
00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:48.750
When you see him, you know what, man, what are you talking about?

591
00:35:48.751 --> 00:35:53.460
This is not comedy supposed to look now because now I can put that ugly face

592
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:57.390
into your comedy. And I'm like, okay, now I get how the packaging works. Right.

593
00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:01.500
But at the time I'm like that packaging is so awful. It's like.

594
00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.010
It's like, like it's like a elephant.

595
00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:08.160
And then they put glasses on it and they put it out. You know what I mean?

596
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:10.230
So it's like, but now I'm like.

597
00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:13.460
<v 3>Good. So Matt, how, how I blasted him?</v>

598
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:16.520
<v 2>So I looked at Sebastian. I said, this guy is,</v>

599
00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:21.770
and then we legitimately became friends. We went to Bahrain, um,

600
00:36:22.190 --> 00:36:24.650
Alba Dhabi. We went to Beirut. Well.

601
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:28.130
<v 3>The story, okay. Bobby had bombed so bad.</v>

602
00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:33.320
He thought it was the crowd. You know what I mean? He was like, wow,

603
00:36:33.321 --> 00:36:37.100
these people just don't get comedy. And then I was awful.

604
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:39.500
This is what you really said to me. He didn't tell the story. Right.

605
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:45.020
It goes up to me. He said, when I saw you on stage and what you did,

606
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:49.190
a single tear came down my face. We had a good time.

607
00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:54.590
X-Box and we started playing FIFA. And that was what we did. We played FIFA.

608
00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.120
This is why this has happened to me.

609
00:36:56.121 --> 00:36:57.890
One time I was at the airport and they have like,

610
00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:59.930
you know how they have different lines. Okay.

611
00:36:59.931 --> 00:37:03.470
So they had this like TSA pre line. Okay. I'm going to TSA pre line.

612
00:37:03.471 --> 00:37:06.710
Now it's getting kind of long. Everybody has TSA pre now. So ain't even special.

613
00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:10.880
But there's these two old people. And I saw the tickets. Yeah. I knew that.

614
00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:13.760
And they were trying to cut and I'm looking around, everybody's got an attitude.

615
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:17.060
Everybody's like, Oh. And I say, I go, okay, I'm going to be the only one.

616
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:23.690
So you go put this all on me. Yeah. I had to go, excuse me,

617
00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:28.820
you in the wrong place, you need to move. It's like, I hate that's why?

618
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:31.880
Cause people don't want to, you know what you put in your, say anything.

619
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:36.140
<v 2>At that TSA? Uh, pocket posi. Wait, why do you know? Why? Why is that?</v>

620
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:38.660
Cause they don't know what it is through the scanner.

621
00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:42.290
So it always gets opened up. Okay.

622
00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.880
And then they had to pull it out.

623
00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:46.510
<v 3>Okay. And who's that embarrassing?</v>

624
00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:51.733
[inaudible].

625
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:55.090
<v 2>It's sticky because of me. Right. But he has to pick.</v>

626
00:37:55.550 --> 00:38:00.530
<v 3>Now my question is you should make a mold of your Dick and you should</v>

627
00:38:00.531 --> 00:38:03.050
make the Lyla possible pocket.

628
00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:07.970
Or you guys should sell their Bobby's Dick. You have so many like stuff.

629
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.800
You guys should send us a Dick maker. maker. Oh Bobby.

630
00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:15.080
That's why you can make 10 of Bobby's.

631
00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:28.880
[inaudible] just take a bath. I take it back. I'm sure. An. Yeah. Bobby,

632
00:38:28.881 --> 00:38:30.650
this is the big you. This is your,

633
00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.040
I mean imagine. Yeah. It's light skin.

634
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.330
<v 1>Tone too. Yeah.</v>

635
00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.210
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. We have to dip this in mustard.</v>

636
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:42.120
And he said that on the stage the other day,

637
00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:45.330
what what'd you say that looked like Bobby looks like, you know the honey bottle

638
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:49.060
with a bear honey Bible. But it's filled.

639
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:54.720
He said that in front of a crowd today. I said,

640
00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:57.780
Bobby looks like if some Asian kids peed in the snow,

641
00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:02.190
then they made a snowman out of bachelor. Did I attack you? What'd I say,

642
00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:09.210
don't try to own camera right now. I'm trying to figure out, Oh wow.

643
00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.750
This is what he does. This is what he does. This is what he does.

644
00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:16.560
He's the worst. I say that you don't look human. You look like him.

645
00:39:16.561 --> 00:39:17.394
Burton drew you.

646
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:22.950
<v 1>Every other episode we've had on tiger belly. He said something about my gosh.</v>

647
00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:25.950
How about the billboard in times square. Yeah.

648
00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.260
<v 0>Yeah. But your billboard would be on a hot dog stand because</v>

649
00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:37.890
it would be so little of a question. Are you hungry?

650
00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.740
Let's go eat. You want to go eat barbecue? Yeah.

651
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.980
Bobby Griffin, what the is that second city dude

652
00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:52.950
is that brought to you by stamps.com.

653
00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.440
<v 5>Hey tag your belly fam.</v>

654
00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:59.190
I'm curious about what you think about cultural appropriation and how people say

655
00:39:59.191 --> 00:40:01.800
it's a form of racism. I see social justice work.
