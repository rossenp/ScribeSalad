00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.230
<v 0>Uh, Hey guys,</v>

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.220
I work in a corporate setting for a company that sells tools that may or may not

3
00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:07.710
be branded with the color orange. The other day,

4
00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:12.120
I was telling my coworker who I have a friendship outside of work, uh,

5
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.140
a story I made up. Let's just say it had to do with midgets and docking.

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.410
The thing that Gilbert does, my boss happened to walk by.

7
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:20.970
I'm not sure if you heard me or not.

8
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.160
Should I be worried that I'll get in trouble?

9
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:26.370
And do you guys every worry about the things you say that are taken?

10
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.110
The things that you say are taken at face value?

11
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.530
<v 1>Oh my God, this guy, should this person be worried that he was talking about,</v>

12
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.510
listen, listen guy, what's his name? Uh,

13
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.710
C money to bring back the idea of the context of your heart. You see money,

14
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.650
see money. I was never going to share.

15
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.140
I was never going to share what I'm about to share. Then I'm going to share it.

16
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.300
I'm going to show up with share it. Um, because I was talking to my therapist,

17
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.200
you know, about, you know, I was telling her about, you know,

18
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.160
the things that I talk about on the podcast and she's like, you know,

19
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.930
but that thing that you just said, isn't true. And I go, yeah,

20
00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:07.100
I know I'm in fact,

21
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.260
it's so embarrassing to say most of the things I say, you know what I mean?

22
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.480
In podcasts over my career. Yeah. Is based either in, you know,

23
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.550
some truth or they're complete and utter lies, but it's like,

24
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.870
you know, it, you know, podcasting is a medium. And when you're telling a story,

25
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.850
you know, it's like, you know,

26
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.380
you have to mold it or you have to add,

27
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.640
or you have to subtract, you know, by playing, telling a story.

28
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.250
Like I admit, as.

29
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.440
<v 0>Mike Bisping says, don't let the truth get in.</v>

30
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.210
<v 1>A ride. So, um, I'm going to say, you know,</v>

31
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.430
I say that I was molested by a guy with down syndrome. Don't you do this to me.

32
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.410
You better be real. I don't, but you guys don't know the truth. The truth is,

33
00:01:57.411 --> 00:02:01.610
is that I think I wasn't molested, but he definitely didn't have down syndrome.

34
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.400
You know what I mean? Put you, you say I know, but I know I can, I,

35
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.720
now I can never say this again, but it's like, you throw in the, you know,

36
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.720
you know, because you have to stand when I was like, you know,

37
00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:16.820
first doing this kind of thing.

38
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.980
I did it New York and I did Opie and Anthony. Right. And if you're,

39
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:26.450
you're on a podcast with Jim Norton, you know, Greg Geraldo, Patricia Neil,

40
00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:31.310
all these hard hitters back in the day, you know, I'm my life as it is.

41
00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:34.850
Isn't shocking enough. Yeah. Yeah. Right. It's like,

42
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.070
what can I do? You know what I mean,

43
00:02:37.071 --> 00:02:41.210
to beat these guys into shocking them and

44
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.410
helping them and whatnot. Right. So I would go in,

45
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.820
in podcast and just make up or exaggerate and whatnot.

46
00:02:49.821 --> 00:02:54.320
Like I tell another story that I poke a director in the stomach

47
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.970
and I call him fatty. Right. Please be true. It is true.

48
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.670
But it didn't happen to me.

49
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.260
It didn't happen to me. I stole it from another, my friend, Mike. Right.

50
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.690
I just finished. Let me see. So then, um, you know,

51
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:16.540
it's difficult to say, you know, and,

52
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:20.260
but like a lot of things are true too. Like for instance,

53
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.460
the things that we talked about today, right. We saw those movies. Yeah. Right.

54
00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:28.810
We saw the two movies we talked about, you know, we watched you pu yeah.

55
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.350
You know, I did dangle a $20 bill in front of Abby and go, are you drooling?

56
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:36.400
I mean, that didn't happen. Right. But what I'm saying is, is that God, yeah,

57
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.260
thank God. But like, what I'm saying is, is that bad, but not that bad,

58
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.080
but when you're going back into, you know, history and it supposedly went in,

59
00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:47.290
in this medium, it's like, you know, people take everything you say,

60
00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:51.610
so literally the story, right. You just can't do it.

61
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.980
<v 2>Oh my God. So when we, um, even before I met you, um,</v>

62
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.910
when I would either listen to you on like your radio appearances,

63
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.170
or even when we,

64
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.350
I think we had only gone out on one date and I listened to all your stuff on

65
00:04:04.351 --> 00:04:05.430
like DVD ASA,

66
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.890
I never in for one second that I ever think that you were

67
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.660
not in performance mode. Like I never thought for one second that, Oh yeah,

68
00:04:15.661 --> 00:04:17.070
that man really did that.

69
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.100
If I really believe that I would have never given you the time.

70
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.210
<v 1>Yeah. That's the truth. Yeah. She doesn't love you,</v>

71
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.320
but it's true. Right.

72
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.140
<v 2>It's like when I listened to people or any comics,</v>

73
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.100
even before being in this world at all, growing up, like,

74
00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.190
isn't that what the, the, the assume that isn't,

75
00:04:38.191 --> 00:04:42.660
that the assumption of like a sane person to think they're performers they're

76
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.430
gunna tell some grandiose, like half-truths. Yeah.

77
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.740
Like, I don't know. That's just the way I took it,

78
00:04:49.741 --> 00:04:53.250
because if I truly believed all of your stories, Bobby,

79
00:04:53.251 --> 00:04:57.330
like we would not have even gone on a date. So like, when it comes to this guy,

80
00:04:57.331 --> 00:04:59.550
we should answer his question is, um,

81
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.720
that relationship with you and your friend, like in a professional setting,

82
00:05:03.721 --> 00:05:07.920
like it is, it is, you know, you know him outside of work.

83
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.160
That's like a private conversation you had like, theoretically in my head,

84
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.600
it shouldn't get you in trouble.

85
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.380
<v 1>Well, you shouldn't tell the story. Did he tell the story at work? The kid?</v>

86
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.370
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, listen, he was saying it like with a friend when I'm like,

87
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.510
when I'm in a corporate environment and sometimes I am right.

88
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.380
Like if I'm like, you know, like when I did splitting up together with Oliver,

89
00:05:28.381 --> 00:05:31.980
Hudson, him and I would be like on set and eat, like,

90
00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:36.150
we'd bring something up and that we want to get explicit with him.

91
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.000
And he would look at each other, we'll get coffee afterwards and talk about it.

92
00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:43.590
Like, we won't do it there because we just know, you know what I mean? That,

93
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.200
you know, you could get in trouble. Right.

94
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.820
So don't do the sh don't tell stories, but you're in your own private home.

95
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.670
Right. Or you're doing some sort of entertainment,

96
00:05:53.671 --> 00:05:57.080
like just like stand up comedy for us. I just want to have this right.

97
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.750
When you're watching anyone's act from bill bird to Sebastian or

98
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:05.660
whoever it might be. Right. It's all.

99
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.760
<v 2>Based on.</v>

100
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.350
<v 1>Some nibble of truth,</v>

101
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.660
but it's all exaggerated for entertainment. Right. I mean,

102
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:17.930
I would love to do an episode where somebody asked me if,

103
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:22.040
if something is utterly true of the stories that I've told,

104
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.670
because I've done thousands of hours of talking, you know what I mean? And, um,

105
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.140
and I would have to say there's a lot of things like the audition that I had

106
00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:34.250
for, um, Godzilla is true. That actually happened.

107
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.050
And that's pretty much, did you really.

108
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.530
<v 0>Go hi. Yes. Oh, wow.</v>

109
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.090
<v 1>No, but so that, those things are true. Right.</v>

110
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.540
But there's so many other things that, you know, I mean, you know.

111
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.430
<v 2>Or when it comes to like this poor guy, like fearing for his job and whatnot,</v>

112
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:52.841
I don't know, man.

113
00:06:52.841 --> 00:06:55.750
I don't even know where I stand because I do like to crack jokes like that with

114
00:06:55.751 --> 00:06:57.830
like my friends and I have gotten in trouble for.

115
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.630
<v 0>If your, if your boss tries to contact HR to say, like,</v>

116
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.300
I heard that he was saying something about docking with midgets,

117
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.130
like the boss is kind of dumb. We never talked about Trump. We don't have to,

118
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.900
well, that's the end of our show guys. Uh.

119
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.220
<v 1>He's back in the white house. Oh my God. Are we really going to do this?</v>

120
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.440
<v 0>Just a little bit? Just a little bit, just a little bit, just a little bit.</v>

121
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:17.680
Yeah.
