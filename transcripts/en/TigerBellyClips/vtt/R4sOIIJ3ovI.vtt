00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.470
<v 0>It really puts things into perspective. I'm in the last chapter of my life.</v>

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.170
<v 1>And here we are camping in our backyard. You guys camp,</v>

3
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.870
we've been camping on a beach too.

4
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.250
That wasn't a beach that wasn't a tent in our backyard. Oh, wait the beach. Yes.

5
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.540
We didn't go to the beach yet.

6
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.710
<v 0>So I'll tell you it's something. All right.</v>

7
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.350
I know what it's like to be alone, like on that show. Okay.

8
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.730
<v 1>We tested his theory about George. Do you remember how you were like, Oh,</v>

9
00:00:28.731 --> 00:00:31.790
he's going to last two days. You are not wrong.

10
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.910
<v 0>No. That's Oh God. You're so you're so beautiful. Um,</v>

11
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.130
Mike [inaudible], um, alone. All right.

12
00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:46.610
So when you're sleeping in a tent in your backyard,

13
00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:49.850
and the reason why we did we have to do this is because, you know,

14
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.570
because of the flooding and the cat, we got a new, hard wooden floors and they,

15
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.880
they put this, um, really potent, um, shine on it or whatever, what's it called?

16
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.820
<v 1>It was a coding, but then it wasn't the,</v>

17
00:01:01.821 --> 00:01:05.090
they didn't use the nontoxic one that I asked them to use.

18
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.360
And so they didn't give us any warning. And so when we came,

19
00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:10.790
we knew we went upstairs. I was like, I told the guy, I was like,

20
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.990
is this safe to inhale? He was like, no, you should probably stay in a hotel.

21
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.410
And this was like at nine at night. And we were like, we have nowhere to go.

22
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.910
They didn't tell us.

23
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.420
<v 0>And when you walked in the house, your eyes would burn. Right. For her.</v>

24
00:01:23.421 --> 00:01:24.950
It was terrible. All your animals.

25
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.720
<v 1>Exactly. Put them away.</v>

26
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.110
<v 0>So then, um, we, we were, we got in a fight on my house.</v>

27
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.510
We did kind of get in a fight. We did get into a fight. Yeah.

28
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.200
I like I'll sleep in the garage if you'd like out my mom's and you know,

29
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.123
it was a whole thing.

30
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.920
<v 1>Here's the thing. He wanted to sleep in the garage with no windows.</v>

31
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:44.510
And the smell was already empty going in through here. So I was like, Oh my God,

32
00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:46.790
he's going to wake up dead. You know what I mean? Like,

33
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.140
I didn't think that this was not to me. This is not a, a good place.

34
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.280
Like there's no windows, no place for the, for the toxins to, you know,

35
00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.360
the fumes to exit.

36
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.010
<v 0>Anyway, um, she goes, we're gonna fight. And then she's like,</v>

37
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.290
uh, I think she said let's camp back in the backyard.

38
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.320
<v 1>Well, I said, let's go to my mom's because she has an extra room.</v>

39
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.200
<v 0>Yeah. I can't sleep in her mom's house. There's no way that's going to happen.</v>

40
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.870
I just sit on the couch all day, all night. Um,

41
00:02:14.871 --> 00:02:19.160
so we just pitched a tent in the backyard and we got all the dogs and stuff in

42
00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:19.994
there.

43
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.510
<v 1>Was me, Jules, Bobby, the three dogs inside the.</v>

44
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.793
<v 0>Tent.</v>

45
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.930
<v 1>How big is the Ted? It's a, it's a nice Mormon.</v>

46
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.700
<v 0>Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's an, a tent and that we're not no sleeping bags.</v>

47
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.190
<v 1>It was fun because we brought in the, we,</v>

48
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.040
that's where we watched a Netflix documentary.

49
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.490
<v 0>Korean pads.</v>

50
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.110
We put these Korean sleep pads down there and then put some sheets on there.

51
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.670
And then it's like three in the morning and I'm laying in this tent.

52
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.190
Right. And it's like, they're asleep. I don't know how the. Right.

53
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.370
I got a dog on my face dog between my legs. Right.

54
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.300
And people are snoring and I'm just sitting there.

55
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.260
And then all of a sudden I realize that there's no Blinky.

56
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.880
I have no Blinky. You're gonna freeze to death. So I'm kind of getting cold too.

57
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.620
And I just knew, I made a decision in my mind. You're not sleeping in here.

58
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.570
You're. You're absolutely. So I just, I went,

59
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.290
I just laid there until the sun came up. He didn't sleep.

60
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.600
<v 1>No, he didn't sleep at all. What was the fear.</v>

61
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.640
<v 0>Of sleep? And then I could see that the, that all of a sudden,</v>

62
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:32.290
like as the sun rises, right. Then the tent becomes brighter. Yeah.

63
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.300
All of a sudden boom it's day. Right. And I'm still laying there.

64
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.590
You know what I mean? It was terrible.

65
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.820
But that had nothing to do with surviving in alone, in alone.

66
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.470
They're offering you money. Yeah. But it's also competitive. Right.

67
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.960
It's also televised. Those are three things that,

68
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.530
so me knowing that it's televised number two,

69
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:57.250
me knowing that it's competitive. Like if it's me against these guys. Yeah.

70
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.690
I have to show face. Right. And I was, so I would do it. I would last,

71
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.580
but there's nothing at stake,

72
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.520
so I'm not going to sleep and I'm going to sleep in there again.

73
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.530
<v 1>Yeah. But it's so comfy.</v>

74
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.280
<v 2>Not for you. It's not comfy for me. Kayla, you stayed up the whole time.</v>

75
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.260
<v 0>The whole time I didn't sleep at all. And then what happened?</v>

76
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.730
Did I fall asleep again during the day? Like for like 30 minutes during the day.

77
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.230
<v 1>The little quick nap. Yeah. Yeah. But it's also like, it, it really wasn't,</v>

78
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.310
it wasn't good conditions because this is over the weekend when we were in

79
00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:33.180
triple digits. So we couldn't even sleep past, you know, 8:00 AM.

80
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.190
<v 0>Digit. So then, um, but we've been, we were back in the rooms, you know,</v>

81
00:04:38.191 --> 00:04:43.020
at the house and it's like, um, yeah, camping is, you know, I dunno.

82
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.213
I dunno why people do it.

83
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.750
<v 1>But you said that we would,</v>

84
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.020
you said that we would go camping if you had your own tent.

85
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.100
<v 0>Yeah. If I had my own Forman tent, I to sleep. Okay.</v>

86
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.500
<v 1>Is there a tent that has blackout shades?</v>

87
00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.030
<v 0>That would be perfect. That'd be perfect for me there isn't. Yeah,</v>

88
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.930
but what I would do is I would get like a Downy Downy, um, a sleeping bag,

89
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.980
right. The one with the little, you know what I mean, Bart and I would get,

90
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.510
I think that anything I'll be fine.

91
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.080
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Well, let's try it then. Yeah. I have to go buy those things.</v>

92
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.540
I'll buy it for you. Yeah. There you guys.

93
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.740
<v 2>We're gonna take a really quick break to share this brand new juicy sponsor with</v>

94
00:05:19.741 --> 00:05:20.070
you.
