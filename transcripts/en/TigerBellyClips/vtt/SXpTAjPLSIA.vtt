00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.890
<v 0>So on Friday, you know what we did? What Kalina? I go, let's go to the set.</v>

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.600
Remember, go for your show. Yeah. Did you have fun then? I did it.

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.480
You met Jenna Fischer, Dan or Hudson? She met what's the guy's name? Oh, um,

4
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.440
Oh my God. Why did I block all of a sudden Portlandia, Portlandia.

5
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.960
God. Yeah. Justin was there. You know what he said to me?

6
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.090
What are you doing here? He said that he is,

7
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.890
I almost get so angry. Might be a bit, cause it's spread army. You know how I,

8
00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:40.970
you know how I took it? I don't work a lot. And it's a shock.

9
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.780
You knew what else did that? To me, it burned my bridges with them. Who?

10
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.280
Years ago, years ago, I don't give a. I don't wanna have a bar.

11
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.770
about this one exclusive years ago,

12
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.990
Neil Brennan comes up to me and goes, Hey, you know Seth, right? Meyers.

13
00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.100
I go, yeah, let's go to his birthday party. It's up the street. Right.

14
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.970
So I go, do you think I can go? He's like, yeah, because Josh is there.

15
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.220
I just talked to them. You can come.

16
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.270
So I went to the party and then some guy walks up to me.

17
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.690
I'm going to say his name. And he looks at me, not in a joking way. I was like,

18
00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:15.950
what the are you doing here?

19
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.780
That way immediately the bridge is burned

20
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.320
forever. This guy I've been talking about this guy.

21
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.760
I can't anymore because there's too much. There's a little bit of a sensitivity.

22
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.570
Oh really? Because of this job that I have now that's in that world. So I can't,

23
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.060
can you whisper it in my ear? No. Okay. Oh no. I'm so like, okay.

24
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.600
You want to play a trivia game? Can you get to guess who it is? Okay. Okay.

25
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:45.440
It's somebody that I work with now on the show that I have now, it was,

26
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.160
she worked with this guy on another show. Hold on, hold on.

27
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.180
She worked with this guy on another show.

28
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.420
I wouldn't know. You'd probably know better. Um.

29
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.400
<v 1>That does not help that help. Oh, I know it is.</v>

30
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.930
<v 0>Yes it is. I say it just, it, I.</v>

31
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.900
<v 1>Won't say it, but yes. Wow. That was good.</v>

32
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.710
<v 0>Because I'm going to, and if this could all be in my head,</v>

33
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.080
but I don't think it is Mike.

34
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.310
I'll tell you why I tell you what I'll tell you why it's not in my head. Why?

35
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.380
Because then a couple of years after that,

36
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:26.180
I was at M cafe and I sat next. I sat next right next to him.

37
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.030
Right. And he was sitting there talking to literally,

38
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.560
we're like a side by side and I kind of leaned to my left just so he can see my

39
00:02:33.561 --> 00:02:37.850
face. And he kind of looked up at me and just started if he was going to,

40
00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:40.670
if he went, Hey, I'd be like, what's up? You know what I mean?

41
00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:43.700
But he just kind of looked up and then went back into his meal and started

42
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:45.590
talking to him. He does to me there.

43
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.870
So with what are you doing here to looking up at me at M

44
00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:54.350
cafe? That bridge is very on, not a good foundation,

45
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.600
but here's my last thing though. Is this? Yeah.

46
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.310
<v 1>But here's why this.</v>

47
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.240
<v 0>Is why I'm mad. Because when he first moved to the town,</v>

48
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:08.680
you knew Bonnie McFarland is Richard boss's wife. Yeah. Okay.

49
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.660
Years ago,

50
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.280
Bonnie was at the comedy store and had just moved into town or whatever.

51
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.020
And Bonnie goes, why? Cause the back then I was sober, but I,

52
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.750
so I had all these connections to all these nightclubs.

53
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:26.230
I would go to nightclubs. I would go to like Hollywood, like scene,

54
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.260
but you hate it. I know. But back then I was like, I couldn't get laid.

55
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:32.110
You know, I was newly sober. I was on mat TV. I was like,

56
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.033
I've got to get this to go on.

57
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.580
<v 2>I did not know clever. I'm not a Clover, but I went clubbing.</v>

58
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.280
It turns out, unpack this more. What was your so on Monday nights to the club.

59
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.353
Oh, I look good.

60
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.110
I got a whole diesel old diesel clothes here. I'm like.
