<v 0>Livable.</v>

27
00:01:22.311 --> 00:01:26.720
It just seemed like it didn't seem like everybody could live there.

28
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.870
Right. With the animals and humans you mean? Yeah. And the animals too. Very,

29
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.050
very, yeah. There's there was a lot going on there.

30
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.620
So there's something I want to share with my, my podcast. Um,

31
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.450
fans listening,

32
00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:44.930
and I want to share with you cause you're a close friend of mine is um,

33
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.910
when my dad died in August, I relapsed and I just want to say that because, um,

34
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.110
I know that a lot of people listen to this podcast and knew that I had 17 years

35
00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:56.180
of sobriety and knew and you know,

36
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.930
a lot of people ask questions about how do I get sober or how do I get my

37
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.890
brother sober? And um, I relapsed, I just got out of an institution. Um,

38
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.040
not an institution. Yes it is. That's so that's like a college bro or an FBI.

39
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.850
That's what it looked like holding Bureau that's investigation.

40
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.930
So I have 11 days sober. I've been going to meetings. Um,

41
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.910
my I'm dedicated to it again,

42
00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:22.010
but I just wanted to share with you out there because, um,

43
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.840
I was super sad about, um, my dad passing. I couldn't handle it. And um,

44
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.470
I just had a tough two or three months. Um, I've had, um,

45
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.340
that's why these podcasts, these new ones since I've been out,

46
00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:37.850
since I left Saturday out of this institution and um,

47
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.370
and um, you know, you were you're the first guy,

48
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.410
was there a girl before me? No, no. There's a girl after you. There is. Yeah,

49
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.930
but you're the first guy. Thanks my,

50
00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:54.170
since I've been out that I'm having on this thing because, um,

51
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.610
I just needed somebody that, um, that knew was very funny,

52
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.980
but somebody that I want to be this car podcast is funny,

53
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:07.780
but I also want to be kind of real about certain. You know what I mean? I, not,

54
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.100
everything has to be ripping on each other and making fun of each other's or

55
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:16.990
whatever I call it. Your Dick is fine, bro. It's not that great. I know,

56
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.410
but it's like, it's it's hit or miss, you know,

57
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.890
but visually it looks like a kind of a sweet potato.

58
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.180
You have that sweet potato shape is weird. Huh? The shape is weird. No,

59
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:32.020
the shape. I feel like it's pretty Hardy. I feel like it's a little too Hardy,

60
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.140
ah, fully edible. Yeah. But it's fully edible. Like,

61
00:03:37.141 --> 00:03:37.974
you'll see like yeah.

62
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.010
Sometimes I'll wake up in the morning and it'll have like toothpicks.

63
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.593
<v 2>Sorry.</v>

64
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.690

65
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.390
Yeah. My Dick is a, Dick is not a fresh product. You know what I mean?

66
00:03:54.391 --> 00:03:58.710
It's been through several Wars. Oh it's aftermarket right closely.

67
00:03:58.711 --> 00:04:01.680

If there are a lot. Oh really? Yeah. It's decorated bra.

69
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.800
I thought it was supposed to be twins, but it's like really premature maybe.

70
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.963

71
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.750
