WEBVTT

00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.050
<v 0>So, um, you want to talk about Vegas or what happened? Uh, yeah,</v>

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.750
I like the story. I like how you think that I set you up for district because,

3
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.980
okay. So Bobby calls me in the middle of the day. Uh, I,

4
00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:15.950
I remember this very specifically, cause I just got done shooting,

5
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.730
like a music video in Venice and he calls me and he's like, man,

6
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.070
what are you doing tomorrow? I was like, uh, I dunno,

7
00:00:22.071 --> 00:00:25.880
I got like a show around here locally in LA, but that's about it. What's up.

8
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.560
He goes, you want to go to Vegas? I go.

9
00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:34.700
What? Because you don't want to go to Vegas with Papa.

10
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.310
Yeah. The way he, yeah. And I was like, like for like, for like,

11
00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:42.650
for a show. Yeah. Yeah.

12
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.120
Daddy's got a private corporate gig and I need you to open for me. Yeah.

13
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.970
I was like, okay, great. And he goes, all right, Mimi,

14
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.160
tomorrow my place pick me up.

15
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.550
And then we're going to go rent a car and then we'll drive to Vegas. I was like,

16
00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.410
okay, cool. So we go to the rental place,

17
00:01:00.411 --> 00:01:02.930
he fills out all the paperwork and we're looking at all the cars.

18
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.350
And then he like tosses me keys, like an eighties movie.

19
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.020
I catch him and he's like, that's us over there. Yeah.

20
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.360
And then I can drive the whole way. Yeah. Yeah.

21
00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:20.540
You're on your iPad the whole time. It's beautiful. Yeah. And uh,

22
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.540
it was a brand new Dodge challenger and

23
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.780
it was like really faster car than we needed,

24
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.460
like by any means. Yeah. And we go to Vegas and uh, we have a good time. Like,

25
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.140
Bobby's take it to dinner, dude. I mean, I remember the picture of that steak.

26
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.620
Steak was ridiculous because they were a fan of Bobby and they're like,

27
00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:46.400
I'm going to get you prime cut. And ju we couldn't even finish the meat. Yeah.

28
00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:49.790
Yeah. And I being, you know, his poor opener, I'm like,

29
00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:54.680
can I take some of this to go? Bobby will not let you take it. Yeah.

30
00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:57.470
The amount of Y Y though, you're like, I paid for it.

31
00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.080
That's nine because people,

32
00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:04.520
I tell that story sometimes and people don't have to believe me the amount of

33
00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:06.230
meals that,

34
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.310
that I wanted to take with Bobby crazy.

35
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.730
But he just leave it, but then you go, you really want that.

36
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.570
You really want that dude. He just take some money, just go get a new meal,

37
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.760
get a new meal. I know I'm such a gross person hearing it,

38
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.900
hearing it though. Yeah. Right. It makes me feel like, why do I behave that way?

39
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.700
So, um, and this is good. This is a good thing. So then what happens every time?

40
00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:35.270
Like, just like on the way we get some meals and stuff like that. And uh,

41
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.770
I remember at the check-in counter,

42
00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:41.720
we had a room like that at this amazing suite at the wind. Yeah.

43
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.740
Yeah. Like it was, it was like this amazing spread.

44
00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:48.500
I'd never seen a hotel like this in my life. I'm from, I'm from Kansas.

45
00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.790
I'm like, I'm in Vegas right now. I'm with Bobby. Like, this is crazy. And uh,

46
00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:55.670
we check in at the counter and uh, he's like, Hey man, uh,

47
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.910
reservation for Bobby Lee. And uh, he says, Oh, welcome Mr. Lee. And uh,

48
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.580
he looked at the guy at the counter. He's like, uh, we're going to,

49
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.080
we're going to go each other in that room

50
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.430
As a joke though, as a joke, as a joke, you know, Bobby does that. Yeah, yeah.

51
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.700
That thing. Yeah. Yeah. And, uh, and,

52
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.420
and I like go into it. I go along with it. Cause I yes. And everything like,

53
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.770
yeah, man, I, I, I'm going to suck his Dick and Bobby didn't like that.

54
00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:26.604
I played along,

55
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.020
Bobby likes to be the weirdest person in the room.

56
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.120
It's mad when somebody gets really upset. I do. He's like, Hey,

57
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.570
just a joke. He's like, yeah, I'm going to his butt. Like, like he had the.

58
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:45.230
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

59
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.860
<v 0>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

60
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.590
So we checked into this room and uh, I tell Bobby, I'm like,

61
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.150
Oh, can we take, can we take some, some promo photos? And he's like, yeah, sure.

62
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.500
And, uh,

63
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.220
and so he has his shirt off and I started to take my shirt off and he goes,

64
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.560
Whoa, what are you.

65
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.393
<v 1>Doing?</v>

66
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.380
<v 0>I was, I was going to join in with you, you know, promo photo. Yeah. Now man,</v>

67
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.330
that's me. You're the opener. Keep your shirt on. He's like,

68
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.260
he's very much likes to put me in my place. Like I like our entire friendship.

69
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.870
I feel bad. It's okay. But finish the story.

70
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.700
So we go to this gig later in the evening and it's for

71
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.130
an all male crowd, literally at the top of the show,

72
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.990
it's, it's a game for Bobby comes down. Men's like, it's, uh,

73
00:04:35.991 --> 00:04:39.750
it's a billionaire men's club. And it's like, you know,

74
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.750
a bunch of businessmen and millionaires. Right.

75
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.910
And I don't know why you would think that they would hire Bert Kreischer or

76
00:04:47.911 --> 00:04:52.410
somebody of that elk. Right. But for some reason they wanted me.

77
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.930
And so we go into this and also in this room, right.

78
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.410
It's not just a showroom. It's, it's a gigantic,

79
00:05:01.411 --> 00:05:03.810
like a warehouse looking like a place. Right.

80
00:05:03.811 --> 00:05:06.600
Like it's a convention ballroom ballroom. Right. Huge ballroom.

81
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.620
And then it's like,

82
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.150
the other half of the ballroom is curtain off for an auction.

83
00:05:12.151 --> 00:05:15.780
So there's like sports cars in there and like memorabilia, you know what I mean?

84
00:05:15.781 --> 00:05:19.600
Yeah. And people are, you know, in, in,

85
00:05:19.601 --> 00:05:22.770
in the place where we're performing, people are there, but they're also,

86
00:05:22.771 --> 00:05:26.370
people are outbidding and walking around in this other area

87
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.690
and we're supposed to perform or just the front part of the,

88
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.580
in this environment is like performing in front of a cafeteria. Yeah. Right.

89
00:05:35.581 --> 00:05:39.060
Because it was, there was no show, almost what it felt like.

90
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.950
It felt like a nightmare. It was, it was one of the hardest gigs I've had.

91
00:05:43.951 --> 00:05:47.640
I've never seen anybody

92
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.710
bomb as bad as your Maya. I mean,

93
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.650
I've seen thousands of shows. Right.

94
00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.200
But here's what loved about it. It's like, you know, when you bought,

95
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.010
like I've seen openers bomb and cry. Ooh. Or they,

96
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.270
they start off strong, but delete the crowd. You know what I mean?

97
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.070
Wither them down into nothing. Right. And when I see that happening, I feel sad.

98
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.820
All right. But what would I see what Jeremiah did? Right.

99
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.290
It makes me proud, like a proud parent, what this guy got.

100
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:25.400
He goes up there and people, there are guys standing up.

101
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:28.660
<v 1>With red.</v>

102
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.500
<v 0>Face veins on their faces. Right. This is a hundred percent true. Yeah.</v>

103
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:33.423
A hundred percent true.

104
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.210
<v 1>You suck, get off, get off.</v>

105
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.740
<v 0>Oh my God. Screaming,</v>

106
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.250
screaming now worried about neighbors that,

107
00:06:48.251 --> 00:06:50.860
but that's literally,

108
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.210
literally that's in the first 40 seconds. Oh.

109
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.410
Right. And I'm in the back, like it through a curtain, looking at them. Right.

110
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:04.030
And when I'm hearing get off, Jeremiah is onstage,

111
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.920
upside down with a stool or something. Right.

112
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.600
And oppose pole. Right.

113
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.560
<v 1>And he's doing some sort of</v>

114
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.270
some sort of bit. Right.

115
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.210
<v 0>He doesn't meaning thousands. He does not care. Right. He does. How much?</v>

116
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.000
Three minutes. No mom said, you said,

117
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.140
this is what you said right before I went off. Yeah,

118
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.240
because you had to do 40 minutes for this call.

119
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.670
Like you do 40 minutes and you go, you go, all right.

120
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.110
<v 1>And easy to do, uh, seven minutes. And if you want to make daddy real happy,</v>

121
00:07:41.111 --> 00:07:43.600
do more like 10. All right. Yeah. Okay.

122
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:47.410
<v 0>And before I went out there, they just done a raffle. They just on a raffle.</v>

123
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.820
And then the guy, the host, he gets handed a card and he goes,

124
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.450
Oh, I guess, I guess the,

125
00:07:55.451 --> 00:07:57.610
the act brought an opener.

126
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:00.880
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

127
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.080
<v 0>This is my intro. I guess the act an opener. Yeah. Uh,</v>

128
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:10.990
please welcome. Jeremiah. Doesn't even say my name is Jeremiah,

129
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.950
Jeremiah. And I walk out nobody claps,

130
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.260
nobody class because they want to see Bobby.

131
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:22.810
So what Bobby knew was going to happen is that I was going to be the

132
00:08:22.811 --> 00:08:26.200
sacrificial lamb for that gig too.

133
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:30.070
<v 1>No, you didn't. No, you didn't. I not as hard as you.</v>

134
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:35.110
<v 0>Bobby, you're doing that thing. You're doing that thing. No, no, no.</v>

135
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.350
He did. He crushed.

136
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:40.203
<v 1>Exactly.</v>

137
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.180
<v 0>But he told me, but, but to preface this on the, on the way to Vegas,</v>

138
00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:48.550
the entire time Bobby is telling me.

139
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.830
<v 1>Bond and I love that you're going to buy.</v>

140
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.520
<v 0>I haven't done that before my first time doing steaks,</v>

141
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:59.700
you actually did on this podcast for three weeks and promote it. Yeah. So,

142
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.580
and I was like, no, I'm not. No, I'm not. You're you're like, you'll see.

143
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.200
You'll see. And then it happened.

144
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.710
The only laugh I heard the entire time was Bobby dying. Laughs.

145
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:09.510
Backstage just cackling.

146
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.160
Cause it was so he thought it was so funny to see what was happening.

147
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:17.390
Just the absolute nothing that I was getting from the crowd. I know,

148
00:09:17.391 --> 00:09:20.690
but I wasn't laughing at the, because of your failing.

149
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.800
I was laughing at the fact that you're seeing two different things at the same

150
00:09:24.801 --> 00:09:29.330
time. Of course you're seeing hatred, like literally like, you know,

151
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:34.850
um, imagine like, um, AOC going to a Trump rally. Yeah.

152
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:39.260
That's what it felt like. Yeah. Like just the wrong person at the wrong time.

153
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:44.540
Right. And then AOC committing right to a speech.

154
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:49.610
Right. And finishing it like w I have a 10 minute speech.

155
00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.850
I made a Trump rally and I'm going to finish it now.

156
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:58.940
AOC saying good night. And then Trump walking out,

157
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.223
kicking her in the.

158
00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.730
<v 1>And saying, yeah,</v>

159
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:09.530
that was Bobby that night after that Trump,

160
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.390
he destroyed. And literally.

161
00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:17.600
<v 0>Like, you know, they're cutting them, the check and stuff. And they're like,</v>

162
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:20.480
wow, that's amazing. Everybody's coming up to him, shaking his hand,

163
00:10:20.481 --> 00:10:22.340
one pictures. And I'm just standing there,

164
00:10:22.341 --> 00:10:25.250
like looking for anything the entire time, just looking for any reassurance.

165
00:10:25.251 --> 00:10:29.930
And uh, the Booker kept looking at me and going, yeah, kid, good luck. Uh,

166
00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.230
yeah. But then Bobby, he knew what had happened.

167
00:10:33.231 --> 00:10:36.230
He took me out to like the nicest steak dinner afterwards and reward me.

168
00:10:36.231 --> 00:10:38.600
He's like, dude, you did exactly why I brought you here.

169
00:10:38.601 --> 00:10:41.180
You did exactly what I wanted you to. I'm going to tell you something.

170
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.200
All right. If he hadn't gone, gone up before me and done that,

171
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.280
I would have struggled for 15 minutes. Of course. Right. Yeah. I knew.

172
00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:53.600
So I needed a kid, right. That was going to commit to it. Right.

173
00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.840
Was going to know he was going to fail. Right.

174
00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:02.090
And set me up and I'm going to say this right now. It sounds cruel.

175
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.750
But I had been that guy, of course. Right.

176
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:09.200
Jay Moore did it to me at USC. Right.

177
00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:14.480
We had a daytime show. Right. It was show supposed to start at five. Right.

178
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:18.660
And I was supposed to do 15 minutes, but I'm, I'm,

179
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.490
I'm in my 15 minutes. And, and I was like, I'm about to wrap up,

180
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.070
but the sun was still up and Jay Moore goes,

181
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:29.540
you're not getting off stage until the sun is your mean

182
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:34.940
gone till it sets until it's black. Oh, geez.

183
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.570
Right. And I remember being up there for an hour.

184
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:41.990
<v 1>Yeah. Eating it.</v>

185
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.620
<v 0>Running around. I did everything. I could,</v>

186
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.380
every trick that I had in the running around.

187
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.470
<v 1>I roll, clap, sing a song. I was doing.</v>

188
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:56.440
<v 0>Everything right. And I so bad. And I got upstaged so angry off state, so angry.</v>

189
00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:00.340
And then Jay went up, you know, I mean, everyone cheered, he killed it.

190
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:04.600
And I just remember just being in a ball of anger in the bag.

191
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:09.250
But then in retrospect, I go, I thought, you know, that's just the best,

192
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:14.740
you know, comedy experience that you can have because it's like,

193
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.520
you're learning to perform, right.

194
00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:23.620
Like when you're on the tonight show and you're bombing, right.

195
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:24.730
If you're,

196
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:29.710
if you've condensed conditioned yourself to pretend that you're doing well in a

197
00:12:29.711 --> 00:12:31.450
hostile environment, right.

198
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.580
People on the camera watching it are going to go, Oh, he's doing fine. Right.

199
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:41.380
It's if you let the audience affect you right. Then you're dead.

200
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.880
And that's why I think the comedy store store is so important because it's such

201
00:12:45.881 --> 00:12:49.270
a tough room. Right? Yeah. We were able to learn how to,

202
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:52.180
that's why when you play the comedy store and then you go to a place like the

203
00:12:52.181 --> 00:12:55.450
ice house, it's easy. It's, it's like,

204
00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:01.000
you're killing it. Right. But, um, I think that, you know,

205
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:05.860
putting young comics in those kinds of environments is a good thing.

206
00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.740
<v 2>In the beginning of all this, you said that in Vegas, he you.</v>

207
00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.100
So it was the other way around. I did him.

208
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.400
<v 0>I you. Yeah, dude, I you. And I apologize. It's okay, man.</v>

209
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.350
But look at you now. I know,

210
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:29.430
but no, it's not that we freaking made it, dude.

211
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.620
I want to say something. Okay. When I watch you, when I watch, um,

212
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:39.630
Tony Hinchcliffe shell, right. What's it killed Tony. Yeah. Right.

213
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:44.760
It's and I watch you improvise into different characters and, and do your thing.

214
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:49.350
I think I literally always think to myself. Wow. That guy is so funny.

215
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:50.723
I really do.

216
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.850
<v 2>We're taking a really quick break to share one of our favorite sponsors. Yeah.</v>

217
00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:58.230
<v 0>[Inaudible] if you need it, you're going to need it.</v>

218
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.570
[inaudible] if you're a man you're to whoop.
