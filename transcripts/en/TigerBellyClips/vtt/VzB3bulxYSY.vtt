1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.410
<v 0>Because of your accent. Yeah. I know. I want to ask a question if that's okay,</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.060
because of your accident and where you're from. Yes. Are you a Republican?

3
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.740
<v 1>Um, nothing. I'm an independent registered independent.</v>

4
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.940
Hm that's it I'm so I'm like when it comes to, uh,

5
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.890
money fiscally conservative, me too. Uh,

6
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.790
when it comes to, uh.

7
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.500
<v 0>Yes. Pretty, pretty open to that. Pretty liberal there. Yeah. Yeah. Well,</v>

8
00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:29.020
you know, it's more libertarian, like.

9
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.370
<v 1>Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. You're a libertarian.</v>

10
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.440
<v 0>Essentially. Right. But, um, I can't and w you know, we're not getting,</v>

11
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.790
we don't go into politics. We don't, we.

12
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.390
<v 1>We don't know enough. We don't, I don't know enough. We don't,</v>

13
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.310
which is why I don't really talk about it.

14
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.960
Cause I don't like to give an educated, I mean,

15
00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.270
I'd rather give you an educated opinion. I don't have that.

16
00:00:47.271 --> 00:00:48.021
When it comes to politics,

17
00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:50.720
I don't have all the facts and I don't want to get up there on the high horse

18
00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:52.880
and say, well, here's how it should be. And I'm like, Oh, I got that one.

19
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.590
<v 0>Here's why I bring it up. Yeah.</v>

20
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.280
The reason why I bring it up is because there is, you know,

21
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.620
you look at my brother, Steve, for instance, right. My brother,

22
00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:04.790
Steve thinks that if Texans right,

23
00:01:04.791 --> 00:01:09.050
are all cowboy hats and Wrangler jeans and they have spurs, he doesn't.

24
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.570
<v 1>Realize he thinks that spurs.</v>

25
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.660
<v 0>Yeah. He thinks that if you go to Texas, Oh no.</v>

26
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.290
There's like really everyone looks it's every mass here.

27
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.730
<v 1>Almost exactly everything.</v>

28
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.670
<v 0>Yes. But there are people that think that like, you know,</v>

29
00:01:25.671 --> 00:01:26.990
people with Southern accents,

30
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.030
thick Southern hazards are from the States that may,

31
00:01:29.031 --> 00:01:31.700
maybe that they are a Trump supporter. Just,

32
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.760
just based on just the exit where you're from and thing.

33
00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:38.600
And I just want to say that, you know, I don't care if you are or not. I'll be,

34
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.130
I love you, regardless, because I know how you feel about me.

35
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.060
I know how you feel about gay people. Right? Right.

36
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.340
I know how you feel about people's rights and whatnot. And there's,

37
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.230
there's nothing oppressive about how you feel about the world. Yeah.

38
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.870
Right. You're a good dude. I'm being real. You're a good guy.

39
00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.630
<v 1>I really do believe that I am one of.</v>

40
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.710
<v 0>The best guys. Like, like.</v>

41
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.190
<v 1>I agree. I agree with you about.</v>

42
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.040
<v 0>Me. Yeah. So where do you live now? I live in.</v>

43
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.180
<v 1>Hickory, North Carolina, moving back. My dad had a stroke a year ago.</v>

44
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.130
So I was out here. I got here in 2000. I was here 18 years. And then,

45
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.860
you know, like I said, earlier, career has always done this,

46
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.500
had peaks and valleys and lows and highs.

47
00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:25.880
And I get to the point where I actually miss my family.

48
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.100
I miss my mom. I miss my dad. I miss my brother. I miss everybody.

49
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.770
And I haven't been there in 18 years. I missed out a lot of.

50
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.080
So when I would go home and visit,

51
00:02:36.081 --> 00:02:39.260
it would be for Christmas or Thanksgiving and holidays. And it was, you know,

52
00:02:39.261 --> 00:02:40.280
it's not the same.

53
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.750
And LA was getting more and more crowded and more and more.

54
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.030
Uh, my property value went up at a, at a townhouse in studio city. So I thought,

55
00:02:50.031 --> 00:02:52.760
let me put this on the market and see what happens. And it was like, bam.

56
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.110
I'm like, Oh, that's good. Yeah, good. It's a sign I'm out. Um, and I do,

57
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.010
nothing has changed for me. I still do the, uh,

58
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.940
I'm doing more in Hickory that I'd done out here in about five years because I

59
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:08.260
have time and people who want to help for no other reason than they like to help

60
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:11.860
me. And they were my friend, you know, um, I don't have to pull favors.

61
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.290
It's different, you know, out here, it's like, you know,

62
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:16.090
we all have business managers, agents,

63
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:19.090
and all this stuff and lawyers and you say, let's do this thing. Like, well,

64
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.020
let me check my calendar.

65
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.330
I don't know if I can do that because I did this thing. And it's like,

66
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:23.840
it's hard to get anything done.

67
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.400
<v 0>They save it. Cause I was in San Antonio and um, the locals there, right.</v>

68
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.230
They drive me around. They'll pick me up at, you know, mean noon,

69
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.150
right. To take me anywhere.

70
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.830
There's just a different kind of energy when it comes to

71
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.800
different towns like these people. And I bet you, these kids,

72
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.300
all these people that grew up with you, John is also, you've been on television.

73
00:03:48.301 --> 00:03:51.330
That must boggled their minds and in their heads, they're like, yeah,

74
00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:54.510
we don't need much. We just want to be a part of it. It's exciting. Yes. Right.

75
00:03:54.511 --> 00:03:55.344
And that's cool.

76
00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.030
<v 1>Yes, yes it is. Yeah. So, um, I I'm loving it. You know,</v>

77
00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:02.700
I'm actually living in the house I grew up in right now.

78
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.310
<v 0>Everything you're saying is going to make me all like all cried. My.</v>

79
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.450
<v 1>Dad is in a skilled nursing facilities, paralyzed on his left side, which is,</v>

80
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.240
but it's real close to our house. And my mom, my mom doesn't, you know,

81
00:04:12.241 --> 00:04:14.580
she's got glaucoma, she has brittle bone.

82
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.280
She doesn't really know how to do a lot of stuff. You know,

83
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.670
she's not computer savvy. So I'm having to wrangle all the medical bills,

84
00:04:20.671 --> 00:04:22.980
all this stuff. So I went home to do that.

85
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.340
And I'm actually happier now than I've been in a long time. Oh my God.

86
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.920
And I'm so happy that I have the ability.

87
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.550
<v 0>To do that. You know what I mean, John, I want to say this. Um,</v>

88
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.870
my dad died a month ago. He had a stroke 10 years ago. Okay.

89
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.670
And, um, he had a major stroke, you know,

90
00:04:41.671 --> 00:04:46.290
and then he kept having him and um, he struggled for 10 years.

91
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.780
I saw him maybe five times in that 10 years. Oh. And um,

92
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.520
maybe six times. And um,

93
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.800
and now every single moment of my life is

94
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.900
regret of not spending more time with

95
00:05:03.901 --> 00:05:08.200
him. Yeah. And by you doing this right now, it really just it's,

96
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.540
it's the only I'm telling you right now, dude. It's the only move. Yeah.

97
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.960
Secondly, this business has changed.

98
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.140
It's changed to the point where you don't necessarily really have to be here

99
00:05:19.141 --> 00:05:21.960
anymore. You know what I mean? I'm I'm,

100
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.180
I have a couple of shows that I,

101
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.870
I have a Netflix cartoon that they asked me to do,

102
00:05:27.871 --> 00:05:30.900
and then I pitched a thing that might happen. But my point is,

103
00:05:30.901 --> 00:05:35.610
is that I think I could have done that if I lived in Phoenix or Ohio and you can

104
00:05:35.611 --> 00:05:37.560
do this anywhere, anywhere. Um,

105
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.770
but the problem is you can't get the best guests, so no, that's true.
