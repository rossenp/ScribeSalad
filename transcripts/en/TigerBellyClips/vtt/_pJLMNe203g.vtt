00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.540
<v 0>No huddle, Nico. No, that wasn't, that was terrible. You know what I mean?</v>

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.730
And they look back at it and then why don't we hire that guy and whatever they

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.940
say, Oh, I hate that. Right. So I go in like a Tom cruise blow up,

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.670
or do you ever like really, dude, what do you think of a, his blow up?

5
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.580
I respected it. He did it for you,

6
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.880
literally. Like nobody has a blow up and only positive.

7
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.343
Ha like

8
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.810
[inaudible] gets angry and doesn't curse. And just as positive things,

9
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.540
if he dropped like an end bomb in the middle of it, I'd be like, Oh, okay.

10
00:00:38.541 --> 00:00:39.374
This guy really?

11
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.840
He just was the best guy. Yeah. Like we're,

12
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.270
we've got to save people's lives and their college education.

13
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.200
<v 1>I think that was a PR move. Yes. But,</v>

14
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.390
but that's just because I think that, you know,

15
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:57.680
his thoughts have dropped since the whole David Miscavige thing when he keeps

16
00:00:57.681 --> 00:00:59.060
doing these big action movies,

17
00:00:59.061 --> 00:01:03.680
but he's really kind of out of the Oscar contender kind of. So I think,

18
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.610
I think that was his attempt to kind of.

19
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.650
<v 0>Galvanized support in the industry and they make him look like a good guy.</v>

20
00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:12.920
Like he came to work on me. Exactly. Because you really care about Corona.

21
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.420
I'm immune. So I'm like you.

22
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.790
But he, he,

23
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.880
he used his power and that's when you know,

24
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.180
he has power because if I would have done it, this is what,

25
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.120
this is what it would happen. This is what, what happened. Right. Hey guys,

26
00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:31.610
I'm going to tell you right now. And then somebody would go, you.

27
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.770
And it's the gopher. Right? The guy holding the boom.

28
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.720
Boom, you. Sit down. You Chinaman. Right. And I'd be like, Oh, I'm sorry.

29
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.540
Right. Whereas they let Tom go, go,

30
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.830
and I'm going to say this last mission, impossible movie. He did bomb.

31
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.610
Do it. One of the best action moves I've ever. He's a beast. He's a beast.

32
00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:56.300
He's a weirdo. But he's a beast though. Yeah. That's the thing,

33
00:01:56.301 --> 00:02:00.830
like if he was funny, he probably be one of us.

34
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.900
Like, he's weird enough to be one of us. He's just not funny. No, but you know,

35
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.710
I have to admit he was in Tropic thunder. He thought he was really acting. No,

36
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:13.730
but he was funny. He was trying to be funny. I thought he was, they were like,

37
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.320
seriously be this. We need you to be that guy. Yeah. Yeah. He is a weirdo,

38
00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:21.170
but you know what, dude, it just, just shows us his power. Yeah.

39
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.870
You know what I mean? Yeah. You could probably do that on your new Netflix show.

40
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.850
right. Good. Yeah. Is it a show or a special, what is it? I mean,

41
00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:31.100
it's an hour special that we broke up in four episodes.

42
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.960
So it's like 15 minutes each. Right.

43
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.010
And there it's what you were doing on Instagram, Instagram literally. Yeah.

44
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.960
And then they, they put it on Netflix. Yeah.

45
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.680
We just filmed like longer versions of it. Yeah. The last time you were here,

46
00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:45.080
we were, that's so much about Netflix, bro. I had to,

47
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.260
but now I know how it works. That's how it works. How do you get laid.
