00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.900
<v 0>Can you back, but when I get fed down</v>

2
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.200
this way, I shut up.

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.910
That's weird. You don't even know what direction, right?

4
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.690
What is the correct direction front to back? I don't get,

5
00:00:17.691 --> 00:00:21.200
what are you angry about? Sassy.

6
00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:22.990
All of a sudden ask us about

7
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.920
[inaudible] those kinds of dirty questions.

8
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.680
We're just talking about beautiful things. You know, you know,

9
00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:37.730
the one memory that I have, I feel bad about me. You about you and I.

10
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.790
What is that one time you picked me up from camp.

11
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.800
Yeah. Oh my God.

12
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.000
Now he trying to hug and he pushed me pushing me away. Which,

13
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.460
so you dropped him off. What happened was I,

14
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.350
so I went to a summer camp where they picked us up in a yellow boss.

15
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.180
Took us into the forest for a month and came back. Yeah, yeah. Then I say,

16
00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:05.840
hi, all the kids are like getting off of the boss.

17
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.080
And I was on the bus. I remember thinking, and people were,

18
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.550
kids were hugging their parents,

19
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.530
but some cool kids weren't they were like, Hey mom.

20
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.620
Right. And getting in the car. And that's what I wanted to do.

21
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.810
But my mom wanted to do cry, mild kisses and the whole thing.

22
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.590
It's why I pushed her. And when I did that, it broke.

23
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.800
I could see it breaking her heart, you know?

24
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.290
Oh, shut up my tongue. Yeah. Because

25
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.560
I always, when I go to a screw out Stephens,

26
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.210
I always put on makeups. So look better. Oh,

27
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.710
you did that for us because I don't want you to push me like that.

28
00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:56.400
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll never, I never,

29
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.850
I never thought about it. That's why I brought it up. I feel bad.

30
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.600
I'm never going to do that again. How he trying to help him? I appreciate that.

31
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.940
And then just, you know, you dealing with just the whole, I mean,

32
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:15.650
just the whole life. I know the whole thing. The whole thing is, um,

33
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.940
it's beautiful though. Isn't it beautiful life.

34
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.580
Oh, some good.

35
00:02:25.581 --> 00:02:30.140
Some bad. But like when I look at, you know, like my, uh,

36
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.210
shoots are not your past still bad.

37
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.940
I thought I grew up very poor.

38
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.890
But when I look at all over the world, I wasn't that bad,

39
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.900
you know? And I thought I'm better because of my friend, the corny peanuts.

40
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.670
I'm so small and well, your friends called you peanut. It was the nickname,

41
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.500
peanut peanut, because we're small, small or less in the class.

42
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.020
I'm kind of bad with Korean.

43
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.510
No, I'm regular.
