00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.050
<v 0>No. Are you going to play cyberpunk 77? Uh, only if I got a PS five,</v>

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.880
you can't play it on this. I think you can, but I want to experience it for,

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.160
you know, I, the way it was supposed to be intended,

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.740
it was attended on the PS five. I think so. Yeah.

5
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.950
So I can't download it on this. Probably. You probably can just lower quality.

6
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.610
Oh. Because I want to play it tomorrow. You probably can. I've been playing.

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.590
I've been waiting 14 years for it. 14. Yeah. I was the last cyber punk. No,

8
00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:30.480
they've never made one before. It's an exaggeration 14 years.

9
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:32.310
No, but they've been like, you know what I mean,

10
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.220
saying that it was going to be released last year and this and that.

11
00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:39.870
It's been like, Reeves is in it. Uh, I love him.

12
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.050
<v 1>I love like my new thing where it's like,</v>

13
00:00:42.051 --> 00:00:44.120
I really do a good job pretending to care.

14
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.720
That's something I'm working on. You don't care about cyber.

15
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.560
How have I been every time you've been telling me about your, your victories.

16
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.890
<v 0>But when you're doing it though, I understand what you're doing.</v>

17
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.510
And I appreciate it, the effort. So when I talk to her, I got she'll go like,

18
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.090
said like I'll be done with war zone and she'll do something.

19
00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:08.330
Say something ridiculous. Like how'd you do, babe. Right?

20
00:01:08.331 --> 00:01:11.530
Which I know she doesn't give a. It's friendly. It is friendly, but I don't.

21
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.320
But it gives me the opportunity to at least say to somebody,

22
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.630
you know what I mean about the excitement of winning.

23
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.650
<v 1>Cause I knew it matters to you. And I also genuinely want to gauge your mood.</v>

24
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.920
If it's like we won, then I know it's like, Oh,

25
00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:26.930
we're going to cuddle and watch movies all night.

26
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.520
<v 0>And also the what drives her crazy. The worst is showing her the wind.</v>

27
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.090
I hate it. I love.

28
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.260
<v 1>And I had to sit there for like 22 minutes,</v>

29
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.950
just like Steve Dylan and him like scream.

30
00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:42.140
And it's like, I don't.

31
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.370
<v 0>Oh my God, there was this one game. I'll tell you.</v>

32
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.490
<v 2>You're a hero, Bob.</v>

33
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.710
I know.

34
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.760
<v 0>No, my brother will make me cry. I believe my brother will go. Like,</v>

35
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.350
like Bob, I just want to say that I've never been more proud of you.

36
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.210
And I just think that like, you know,

37
00:02:05.211 --> 00:02:09.590
you've improved and you're like a real warrior and it, it just, and, and,

38
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.420
and in my mind, I'm like, okay, Bob, he's 19, he's 20 years old. Right.

39
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.500
When I know that he's, you know, what is he now? 47. Wow.

40
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.030
He's 47 years old. 46. Are you still excited in your mind? He's 19. Really?

41
00:02:23.031 --> 00:02:26.060
In my mind, I got it. He's 19. He's 20, you know what I mean? But he, uh,

42
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.480
he gets really emotional. He gets me all emotional about it. You know,

43
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.880
it's our way to bond. Why not? You know? Yeah. But so cyber punk, uh,

44
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.280
she, she feigns, you know, why not? Why not? Yeah. Here's an opportunity though.

45
00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:44.030
She said she does play a game called among us. So, and you know what,

46
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.910
I will play it. And I would like to engage and play with her.

47
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.420
There was this other game that we're playing like that, um, finding the number,

48
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.263
that one again.

49
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.500
<v 1>But those are those, aren't like actual what's there like puzzle games.</v>

50
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.530
Juliana is playing for Lawrence.

51
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.400
<v 2>Is it Oh, wrong and passes, Valor rent.</v>

52
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.130
[inaudible].

53
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.630
<v 0>Can I just say this though is look at a show like Queens gambit</v>

54
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.700
and we've watched two episodes that I love the show. She seen the whole thing.

55
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:18.960
<v 3>Have you seen it? No.</v>

56
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.200
Or I started that and I was a little bored at the first episode. So.
