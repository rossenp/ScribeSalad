00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.350
<v 0>Nice purple badge. And we've got my friend, my, my, uh,</v>

2
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.120
Don now Rawlings given him a round of applause. Everybody.

3
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.990
I don't want to round on pause. I want to, first of all,

4
00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:19.640
I wanna apologize to all my fans that are going to look at this and say,

5
00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:24.200
what the is he doing? Desperate times. We cry desperate.

6
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.260
First of all, first of all, we'd be clear for everyone.

7
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.640
Let them know that I don't want to be here. Okay. Let me be clear. No, no, no,

8
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.150
because people like all, they got such a friendship in a bucket.

9
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.710
I don't want to be here. The only reason I want to be clear,

10
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.040
the only reasons, and this is probably, I don't understand Bobby,

11
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.200
this podcast has so many fans. Exactly. Thank you. Look at it.

12
00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:53.090
Like a person that's going on a TV show.

13
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.070
He know they're going to ask some dumb questions,

14
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.810
but it's so many viewers that you got to go there. I don't this.

15
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.850
The only reason I'm here is because, uh,

16
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.060
there are people that we're not the Kelly Clarkson show.

17
00:01:05.061 --> 00:01:08.240
Is that what you're saying? No, not now. Clark said no,

18
00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:10.340
but people go on there because it has got a lot of viewership.

19
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.760
Is that what he's saying? Yeah. That's exactly what I'm going to say to you is.

20
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.670
Yeah. Yes. And if my pockets and more viewers, I would never be on this

21
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.990
[inaudible]. I need to, the people in the streets told me,

22
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.780
they said you want to be a part of what? The facts are. Facts. Okay.

23
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.390
Facts are facts. All right. And it's so interesting that you say that.

24
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.590
Cause I wasn't even gonna bring this up,

25
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.740
but it's like when you started your new podcast, right.

26
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.190
You're trying to start a little war with me right on Instagram.

27
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.320
Which to me made it seem like you wanted to come onto our podcast and you

28
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:44.180
want to collaborate. No, I wanted to with you. Yeah. Oh, you want to with me?

29
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.600
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I wanted to, like, I like fighting you. I like

30
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.633
fighting you. I like funny,

31
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.690
but I had to stop the fight because nobody wanted to join the team.

32
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.030
You were too deep, real deep in the Asian community.

33
00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:01.190
When it comes to like do with

34
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.990
like hacking or anything like that, I'm going to lose.

35
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.000
You don't even have this many viewers. We have one young Asian

36
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.020
that created some type of robot.

37
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.440
[inaudible] nah, I like football. I like with you too.

38
00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:24.560
But there is something with us that whenever I see you,

39
00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:28.550
sometimes you'll like walk the other way. Or you, you, even before the pandemic,

40
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:32.090
you would create a distance because you, you, you can't handle my,

41
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.760
my sexual energy. Okay. You guess what?

42
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.330
This is why you're such a genius because I don't know how many years

43
00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:42.830
it took you to figure it out. Yeah.

44
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.910
I can't handle sexual energy from anybody with a Dick. You know what I'm saying?

45
00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:54.410
Like sexual energy to you for you.

46
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.680
I just exude it because I'm just a being, I know you're a B,

47
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.670
but I'm not that type of being right. We're different type of beings.

48
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:03.100
You know what I'm saying? Yeah. And this is why I say, I know this.

49
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:07.210
I know you're from a place where like, and this may sound weird for some people.

50
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.900
Yeah. Were kissing the guy in the mouth. It's not considered a homosexual.

51
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.410
I don't. I find it European. I don't find it homeless. That's my point.

52
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.330
I'm not a European. But you do, you do know Europe exists.

53
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.790
I do have so many European. This is like some of my favorite bits,

54
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.880
but it's that? They're. Yeah. Alright. They have vaginas, right?

55
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.390
I don't do they not purple vagina. Okay. But they have a giant,

56
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.530
that's the difference in cultures? Let me just say this then. Okay.

57
00:03:37.531 --> 00:03:41.430
For instance, if I was at home in my head it's it's it's good.

58
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.770
Yeah. Yeah. I really like nature. And we'll get to that later. Well,

59
00:03:46.771 --> 00:03:49.620
you could of rock that hat. You could have rock that hat 30 years ago.

60
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.900
I could rock. I got swag. I can rock anything.

61
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.020
I think 30 years ago would have been weird. Now, as you're older,

62
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.970
you asked me a question, Bobby, I'm giving you my answer. And you said no.

63
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.000
So are you going to interview me or are you going to interview your school?

64
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.300
[inaudible] go leave. Don't leave

65
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.160
somebody to bounce ideas off.

66
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.380
Yay. I'm disturbed by this plexiglass. you. Call it. Yeah.

67
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.770
Cause I know you're trying to prep. Prep, prep, practice, correct.

68
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.060
COVID protocol.

69
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.860
But me being from the hood and you being Asian on the other end side of

70
00:04:31.861 --> 00:04:35.700
glass. Yeah. This is where you guys get empowered. Like

71
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.450
I'm telling you like it's certain neighborhoods like the

72
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.080
Asian person talked to more. The thicker,

73
00:04:46.081 --> 00:04:49.590
the Bulletproof glass right now. You're not going to talk to my.

74
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.480
Cause I could kick myself through this right here. You was like,

75
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.190
you, you on my show.
