1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.860
<v 0>Zona or that a general path? No, no, no,</v>

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.470
but we had, but mostly people were in that were in my group was trauma,

3
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.850
but there was sex addict.

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.680
<v 1>I mean, there was, there were addicts.</v>

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.540
<v 0>That whole thing, the red, yellow, I had to write that chart as well. Right,</v>

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.910
right, right.

7
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.570
<v 1>And is that curtailed to each person? Like what that looks like? Okay. For sure.</v>

8
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.840
<v 2>So some people will have, like, you know,</v>

9
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.220
if I act out with pornography, that's relapsed other people, you know,

10
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.790
not so much, like for me, that would be the yellow light behavior,

11
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.350
even though I just don't with that.

12
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.670
<v 0>But for me, it was like going to strip clubs was not in the thing.</v>

13
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.610
And then that my therapist or my counselor was like, no,

14
00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:46.190
that should be in the red. I go. Why? Because he goes to,

15
00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:49.970
he was telling me that because by you partaking in that, right.

16
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.500
These women, not all, but most right.

17
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.270
Or some right. Also are people who are victims of trauma.

18
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.440
Right. And it's just your site. You're, you're feeding into that,

19
00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:04.640
you know what I mean, a cycle. Right.

20
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.620
And so I remember putting that into that porn was in that, you know,

21
00:01:09.621 --> 00:01:12.260
and, um, the banana massage parlor,

22
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.480
what's the banana tug, which one's that one.

23
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.540
<v 3>Address or whatever. Is there a one called the banana massage?</v>

24
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.060
I thought you were promoting one. I'm like, is that on Fairfax?

25
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.020
<v 2>The massage joint.</v>

26
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.610
<v 0>Yeah. You know, it's funny with the massage joints before I met you, my friend,</v>

27
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.110
my friend and I, right. He's like, we should just do it right now.

28
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.580
I've never done it before.

29
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.900
So we went to a place and a place that he normally goes to,

30
00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:51.080
and there was a gate and I had a duck. He had to bring it, you know,

31
00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:54.050
you have to ring up, do a buzzer and that hello.

32
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.170
And a woman looked through the window and she goes, no,

33
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.010
she looked at me and she goes, no. Then we went to another place.

34
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.790
Same thing happened? No. But did she say yes? Yes.

35
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.230
Because she had been at both places. So I thought I looked like a nark.

36
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.510
Do I look like a narc?

37
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.790
<v 2>I wonder if, because it's such a predominantly Asian thing,</v>

38
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:21.350
like massage parlors. I don't know if that's, I don't know. I don't know.

39
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.870
<v 3>You looked at my brother, right?</v>

40
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.890
<v 1>The it's the, um, the Asian model, minority myth.</v>

41
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.830
They don't want to see you go down like that. They're okay.

42
00:02:30.831 --> 00:02:33.140
Seeing the white man go down, but not, not our brother.

43
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.590
<v 3>That could be it. It could be it.</v>

44
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.320
<v 2>Or maybe, maybe they, they, uh, they don't want to be,</v>

45
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.870
they don't want you to see them doing that.

46
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.150
<v 0>Shame. Yeah. How horrifying would it be if you see this? Right.</v>

47
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.010
So I'm gonna open up a curtain and you go, mom, it was your mom.

48
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.770
That would be a nightmare worst. Right.

49
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.050
Cause then I would have to get in there and just to try to fix it.

50
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.020
<v 2>Cheers to us, man. Congratulations to us. Isn't it great. Like to not have like,</v>

51
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.850
you know, like all of the,

52
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.500
the attendant stress I've like

53
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.660
and deal with with me. And I was just like one of these jerks where, you know,

54
00:03:18.661 --> 00:03:21.480
like I got I'm super into the girl and then like,

55
00:03:21.481 --> 00:03:25.440
I hook up with them and I'm not into them anymore. You know, like that whole,

56
00:03:25.441 --> 00:03:26.274
it was,

57
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.840
it was just like sociopathic this pattern of like,

58
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.980
you know, uh, pouring on the charm, this like, like, you know, um, and,

59
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:38.430
and really feeling like we batch equated with,

60
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.540
with the woman and pouring on the Chimp, groping her in, it was just like the,

61
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.040
you know, the,

62
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.870
the equivalent of just being like misleading and exploitative and

63
00:03:48.871 --> 00:03:51.540
then neglectful and then abandoning, you know,

64
00:03:51.541 --> 00:03:55.190
like it's just up, man. And, and,

65
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.740
and the shame that I would have, like when, you know,

66
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.000
when I went through that cycle, it was like, God, you know, I hear,

67
00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:04.080
I burned someone, you know, like I just burned someone with the ghost routine.

68
00:04:04.081 --> 00:04:08.730
Like I would feel my self esteem was just

69
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.740
nonexistent.

70
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.060
And I think that whenever we're in a position where we are feeling

71
00:04:15.061 --> 00:04:17.280
victimized or resentful,

72
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.080
it's the really helpful thing to be able to put yourself in the shoes of the

73
00:04:22.081 --> 00:04:23.820
person, towards your feelings.

74
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.810
<v 0>Hey guys, we're going to take a quick break to show him.</v>
