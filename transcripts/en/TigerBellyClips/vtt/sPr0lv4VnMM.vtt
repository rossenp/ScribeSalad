00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.130
<v 0>Hope like when, you know, a Seinfeld or a big act would come into town.</v>

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.770
I was in Arizona. If you're open middle on the road, or you had a headliner,

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.520
it was all sort of like, not the same, but everyone would just.

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.410
And so whenever you're on the road, you're like, Hey,

5
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:16.080
I just worked with this guy who is your middle? Oh, it was good.

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.150
And everyone sort of knew each other over the years.

7
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.760
And you just realize you're all in the same racket now,

8
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.770
but there's like a fraternity club to that that

9
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.660
you just sort of with comics. I start liking them until proven otherwise.

10
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:34.350
So I'll just say, Hey man, Hey man, until someone rubs me wrong or I,

11
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:37.560
they don't like me or whatever, but overall I just get along, you know,

12
00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:42.240
I will start by being cool because when I was on the way up,

13
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.910
people were pretty cool. And you just wanted them to, Hey, you know,

14
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.300
like tell me about being a headliner or ask questions about.

15
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.700
So it's fun.

16
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.000
Cause usually I want you to talk to you start bullshitting about some comic you

17
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:57.210
work with or do you know this guy? And you know some of their jokes,

18
00:00:57.211 --> 00:01:00.990
you talked about the repeat, everyone, other jokes. It's fun. I like that.

19
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:03.670
So I liked the comedy world. So Adam,

20
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.030
he brought me into the comedy store cause I saw him. He does. He goes,

21
00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:10.200
you should do sets here. I never did a set there cause I auditioned when I,

22
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.770
before SNL and I didn't get it, I just,

23
00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:18.330
when I was 20 Mitzi and Mitzi said, now Louie Anderson got me in. Alright.

24
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.250
<v 1>Cut the tape. What happened?</v>

25
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.780
<v 0>No, let me, he got me in. And he just knew Schneider's something I knew.</v>

26
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.240
I knew Robin, he got me audition and she,

27
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.240
and he walks out on the sidewalk right there on sunset again, like so nervous.

28
00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:34.280
He goes and she, and like.

29
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.200
<v 1>Yeah, God.</v>

30
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.250
<v 0>And I thought he did good. Funny boys got me into the improv,</v>

31
00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:44.930
which is comedy team. And they said, they told me to start getting spots.

32
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.420
So I said, okay, so anyway, that's how it started.

33
00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:50.240
But I never went back to the comedy store because of that.

34
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.760
<v 2>Yeah. It's just, you know, I, Steve Harvey,</v>

35
00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:56.960
one time I saw him walk in cause he was doing like fat Tuesday, which was a.

36
00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.930
<v 1>Yeah, it was called fat Tuesday.</v>

37
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.970
<v 2>Yeah. Fat Tuesday. It was on Tuesday nights and it was, um, and there's,</v>

38
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.120
I'm going to say this word and I don't want to get in trouble for it,

39
00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:12.710
but this is what they call it. Know it was called urban comedy night. Whoa.

40
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.780
That's what I was called.

41
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.710
<v 1>It was because of chocolate Sunday.</v>

42
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.040
[inaudible] I didn't prep, but that's what they have. Is it the belly room?

43
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.430
<v 2>It was no, it was in the main room. So, you know, Cedric and all these guys.</v>

44
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.830
So I remember Steve Harvey came,

45
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.000
walked in to the building and he spit on the wall,

46
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.840
down the hall. I'm not kidding you down the hallway. He goes,

47
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.580
this club. Mitzi, shore. Try to audition for this.

48
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.700
So people have, you know, when Mitzi ran it, this resentment, I was at a,

49
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.900
I've said this before.

50
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.260
I was sat next to Mitzi during a showcase and this guy and

51
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:03.820
he was killing right and admitted in, she goes online.

52
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.100
Um, he hasn't had that and I go, um,

53
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.290
Mitzi that's Louis CK. He has his HBO.

54
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.123
<v 1>Special.</v>

55
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.560
<v 2>He was just doing like a, just spot. No, he was showcasing. Oh. And she,</v>

56
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.370
she looks at me. She goes, he hasn't had that. Oh boy, I go,

57
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.270
he doesn't have what? No talent. Yes. You know what I mean?

58
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.080
<v 0>I mean, you know, no matter what you say about him, you got to say right.</v>

59
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.003
It's good job.

60
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.820
<v 2>He was so funny that night. But Mitzi is just, um.</v>

61
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.460
<v 0>I never met her. I never saw her my life. Yeah.</v>

62
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.110
I was in the back or whatever that was pitch black dirty comedy store,

63
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.660
which it might get a good scrubbing while they're out.

64
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.820
I had Adam while you're in there,

65
00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:47.940
let's get the scrubbing bubbles in there and really give it a,

66
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.690
but do you like the club? I do like it because I never really out of resentment.

67
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.480
I didn't know anyone. I didn't know how to get spots. And I just said,

68
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.500
I wish I had a place to practice. And then I met Adam through whatever.

69
00:03:58.501 --> 00:04:03.030
And then he goes, there's your coming down? So I went down and he goes,

70
00:04:03.031 --> 00:04:05.460
I'll give you a spot whenever. So I walk, he goes, just come in whenever.

71
00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:08.550
So I went in, when I knew it was just go next. And then I came in a week later,

72
00:04:08.551 --> 00:04:11.460
he goes, just go next. And then I go, I don't want to bump.

73
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:12.810
Then I was turning into bumping.

74
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.253
<v 1>I go, uh.</v>

75
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.790
<v 0>I'll just tell you ahead and just throw me on the lineup.</v>

76
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.820
And then I don't want to be one of these guys. So, uh.

77
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.740
<v 2>Cause you were one of those people that like,</v>

78
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.690
cause we had the same old before Adam, because I'd been there since 1995.

79
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.370
Oh really? Oh yeah. I was a doorman. I did the whole. Okay. Yeah.

80
00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:37.080
So it's like, when I'd seen the same acts for 15 years,

81
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.570
she never invited new people in.

82
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.310
<v 0>Right? He, he put together a good squad. My God, he brought us those lineups.</v>

83
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.913
<v 1>You.</v>

84
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.370
<v 0>Those lineups just prompt me to share like sit on it. It just starts.</v>

85
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.260
<v 2>To spin this way. You want a green one?</v>

86
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.380
<v 1>No, it was pretty.</v>

87
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.030
<v 0>Got to jam it so that it keeps spinning. Yeah. Whatever, you know. Yeah. Uh,</v>

88
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.530
back to this. Can you hear me now?

89
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.470
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. What are you doing, George, please. Frank Brown.</v>

90
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.420
<v 2>Yet. Yeah. Those lineups are insane.</v>
