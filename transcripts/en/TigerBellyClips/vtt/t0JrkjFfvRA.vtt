00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.830
<v 0>But, you know, naked, old lady or something.</v>

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.700
<v 1>But as now you're a dad, right? I mean, just things change, you know, because,</v>

3
00:00:07.701 --> 00:00:09.290
you know, as a comic, you know,

4
00:00:09.291 --> 00:00:11.630
we're thinking of all these up things and you know what I mean?

5
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.800
<v 0>My act has not changed my thinking of up things,</v>

6
00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:18.890
my behavior around the house. That's,

7
00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:21.560
that's why I quit drinking because it was like, I was getting, like,

8
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.490
I was getting a hammered at home.

9
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.670
It was one of the deals where like, uh, you know,

10
00:00:28.671 --> 00:00:32.570
going out to a bar was starting to become a pain in the. So,

11
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.080
but I had never brought booze home. I never had it in the house,

12
00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:38.930
so I never had a problem with it because I always had to go out to get it.

13
00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:41.900
That's where I up. It's why you never buy cookies.

14
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.020
Cause if they're in your house, you're going to, you're going to eat them. Yeah.

15
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.800
Don't buy this. And then it's just like, I want to eat some bad food,

16
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.400
but it's way out there. And your laziness will keep you in shape.

17
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.240
Cause I don't want to go out there. So booze was the same thing. And then like,

18
00:00:56.241 --> 00:01:00.500
I, I made the mistake of learning about it. So then I was like, Ooh, this,

19
00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:03.830
this bottle here. And then, you know, acting like I'm not a drunk. So,

20
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.480
and then there was all of this.

21
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.920
I gotten into conspiracy theory and the Ponzi scheme of our money system and all

22
00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:13.550
of this. And uh, it just became too

23
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.130
heavy. And like my wife's like, you got to stop. This stuff is nuts.

24
00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:21.110
And I went completely the other direction.

25
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.730
I got outta conspiracy theory theory and I started watching me TV

26
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.080
and I was just watching all these classic shows during a simpler time if you're

27
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:30.914
white,

28
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.180
a friendlier time. Um, and I would watch it.

29
00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:40.460
And then everybody on there was smoking and drinking and.

30
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.380
And I would sit there drinking with them and I would watch 77 sunset strip.

31
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.510
I'd watch Peter Gunn watch, uh, what are the other ones I watched?

32
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.000
I just watched, you know, Mannix,

33
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.710
like all these gum shoe shows. I would just watch these things and I would,

34
00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.750
I would just get hammered.

35
00:01:59.751 --> 00:02:03.410
And then like then all of a sudden I had a kid and I was just kinda like,

36
00:02:03.411 --> 00:02:05.330
if anything, medically goes wrong right now.

37
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.740
I am like too drunk to drive like this and I want to be,

38
00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:11.420
and I also don't want to be that guy.

39
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.640
Cause I saw kids that I went to school with when I was kids whose parents sort

40
00:02:16.641 --> 00:02:18.380
of openly drank in front of him.

41
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.570
They were sort of the first ones to really start getting after

42
00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:27.170
it, you know? And um, I just was like, all right, I don't want to do that.

43
00:02:27.171 --> 00:02:30.380
And then I quit drinking and then I dropped a bunch of weight and then my,

44
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.610
my self-involved vanity kicked in. I was just like, I kinda like this.

45
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.900
Yeah.

46
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.650
<v 1>But you know, I've never even thought of there's two comics in my head.</v>

47
00:02:39.651 --> 00:02:43.010
I'm like, you know, I never thought about having kids, you know, I mean, but uh,

48
00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:47.120
years ago Al magical invited me to his house and I had dinner with his kids and

49
00:02:47.121 --> 00:02:49.040
his wife and it was proper.

50
00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:53.480
We put the thing on the thing and then the utensils that was nice, the candles,

51
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.710
you know what I mean? It was real nice.
