00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.770
<v 0>That's like East coast. Good fellowship. You don't rat you don't rat.</v>

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.240
<v 1>No, that's straight across the board. You don't rat, which is, what's so funny.</v>

3
00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:11.510
Now all these comics trashing other comics on social media.

4
00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:14.240
I just don't understand that. It's just like, what? W like, you've,

5
00:00:14.241 --> 00:00:17.300
you've become like comics already get.

6
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.710
Why would you go if you don't like somebody special or you, or whatever,

7
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.270
you don't like something that they said, I don't know. That's a, that's a new,

8
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.550
uh, phenomenon.

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
<v 0>There's a lot of new fall of phenomenons this year. And, um,</v>

10
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.730
I don't want to get into it, but, um, no,

11
00:00:34.731 --> 00:00:37.610
because it's going to deal with stuff that we don't want to talk about.

12
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:39.980
Like cancel culture and whatnot. You know what I mean?

13
00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:44.180
But in terms of like people ratting people out and you know what I mean?

14
00:00:44.181 --> 00:00:47.810
And it's been a very, uh, difficult thing, you know,

15
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.980
just take an SNL character idea. It's called Twitter, lawyer.

16
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.570
<v 2>Or lawyer toward a lawyer. Do you have any opening statements? Yes,</v>

17
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.980
your honor. I'm all out of.

18
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.100
<v 1>The funniest opening statement to just burning down somebody.</v>

19
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.370
<v 2>Um, but it is, it is what it is. It is what it is, what it is. It is.</v>

20
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.500
<v 1>Uh, but my generation would have been doing the same thing.</v>

21
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.830
If we came up on 'em on computers and stuff,

22
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.810
it's a weird sort of thing.

23
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.880
<v 2>It's not like a new mentality.</v>

24
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.350
<v 1>You think it's just access to a keyboard? No, I think it's the,</v>

25
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.140
uh, the power of not being face-to-face where, when I was growing up,

26
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.990
like there was a rule when I, this is so funny to hear now,

27
00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:43.130
but when I was growing up,

28
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.760
there was a rule you went to a party or somebody invited you over,

29
00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:51.050
you do not bring up politics and you don't bring up religion. And then like,

30
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.300
social media is the inverse where it's just like everything.

31
00:01:56.301 --> 00:01:57.740
You're not supposed to bring up.

32
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.690
You bring up in all rules of common decency are just

33
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.580
out the window. And, and, um, you know, the whole,

34
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.540
Hey, I can't, you know, as a guy growing up, there was always that, you know,

35
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:14.360
there was there's that line. You learn where the line is.

36
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.560
If I go past that line, I'm risking getting the kicked out of me.

37
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.450
And that is sort of, um, you know, it's like disappeared.

38
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.010
Um, it's funny because.

39
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.980
<v 0>Like, even there, I have to admit,</v>

40
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:31.700
like I discovered a couple of comics that I love that are,

41
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.600
that could be, you know, Republicans or whatnot. Right. They're not out.

42
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.890
<v 2>You hear rumors. And my initial response is what is wrong with that?</v>

43
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.950
I know I'm not, I'm just, there's nothing wrong with this. They're not out,

44
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.930
but not out as Republican, you know, they did, they keep their stuff.

45
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.810
Private is what I meant, because liberals are out of their [inaudible].

46
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:56.540
I understand that, man. Listen to my point though. Okay. Let me finish my point.

47
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.220
Okay. My initial reaction, like, ah, right.

48
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.850
<v 0>But it's like, no, it's, I'm just going to make up a name. It's Joey,</v>

49
00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:06.130
he's a good guy. You know what I mean? It's like, you know, it's like.

50
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.350
<v 2>Nothing to do with it. This listen, bill</v>

51
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.530
volatile, love how judgmental the left is. You don't know anything about it. Oh,

52
00:03:16.531 --> 00:03:18.480
he's a good he's. He is still,

53
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.750
I understand.

54
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.470
<v 0>But at the end of the day, it's like all these even now, because of the,</v>

55
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.010
of politics and the election, all that stuff. Like I try not to like,

56
00:03:29.011 --> 00:03:33.840
let it ruin or dictate how I feel and whatnot, because at the end of the day,

57
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.820
it doesn't make who you are as a person, you know, your political affiliation,

58
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.600
you know, we, we there's good guys everywhere. There's bad guys everywhere.

59
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.690
<v 1>And you have a wide variety of people in your life. That's what I'm saying.</v>

60
00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:48.660
It goes back to those alt rooms where it just became, like, it was just,

61
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.430
everybody was it's like, it was the echo chamber of it. That I,

62
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.200
that was what, um,

63
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.820
I found fascinating to go in and do comedy in front of

64
00:03:59.821 --> 00:04:03.990
like that. Like, if you were to graph the people in the room, like,

65
00:04:03.991 --> 00:04:07.770
it was almost like a S like a straight, like there wasn't an, Oh,

66
00:04:07.771 --> 00:04:10.080
this guy does this and this person's over here. It was just sort of like,

67
00:04:10.081 --> 00:04:13.300
you know, like, uh, like, uh, what do you call it? Like, it's just like,

68
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.020
all the dots were like right there, right there. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

69
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.290
Which made it like, uh,

70
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.800
I don't know. It was so easy to get into trouble, right.

71
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.690
During your set there. Cause it was just like,

72
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.370
there was just one place where you.

73
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.010
<v 0>Right. You won't have a Brian Holtzman in a room like that. I mean, I would.</v>

74
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.980
<v 2>Exactly where I would put off. I w I would film it and.</v>

75
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.360
<v 1>Yeah. But no, I, I think, uh, you know,</v>

76
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.510
that's why I just find that, like, that stuff fascinating. I tried and like, I,

77
00:04:48.511 --> 00:04:51.120
you know, I definitely, you know, I joke about politics and like that, but,

78
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.780
you know, I'm not going to get on somebody cause they're, you know,

79
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.140
like if you say you're liberal, I don't then think like, Oh,

80
00:04:58.141 --> 00:05:00.420
that means that you're you're this, this, I mean, there's so many,

81
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.740
there's the spectrum of being on the left is the spectrum of being on the right.

82
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.270
You know? And, um, I dunno, I'm kind of hoping that we,

83
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.590
we maybe learned something over the last 20 years

84
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.350
of just, you know, everybody just,

85
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.180
like half the country just on whoever's proclaimed.

86
00:05:20.181 --> 00:05:23.370
I really feel like the first George Bush was the last guy who was kind of

87
00:05:23.371 --> 00:05:26.490
allowed to be president without half of his country,

88
00:05:26.491 --> 00:05:30.420
trying to take him out of office, kind of started with the Clinton,

89
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.480
lying under oath about the blow job.

90
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.160
And then it was Bush stole the election and Albana was not from here.

91
00:05:38.161 --> 00:05:42.390
And everything Trump did was just like, you know, I mean,

92
00:05:42.391 --> 00:05:43.860
I don't know how that helps people, but.

93
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.100
<v 0>It doesn't. And I think we're at a precipice.</v>

94
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.220
<v 1>And that's why I stopped giving you, Bobby. I was just like, you know what?</v>

95
00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:51.054
I need to bring.

96
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.350
<v 2>The two coasts. All right.</v>

97
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.970
But here's I want to it's that old boy, right?

98
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:05.110
<v 1>I do. Yeah. Oh my God, dude. I got a horror movie, but for people at home,</v>

99
00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.640
he told me about this movie,

100
00:06:06.641 --> 00:06:10.750
like 10 years ago and I that one and then the audition.

101
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.180
Oh my God.

102
00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.960
<v 2>I, you invited me to your birthday party one time. Yes. And, uh,</v>

103
00:06:15.961 --> 00:06:19.510
I brought you the DVD of old boy as a gift. Yes you did. Yeah. Yeah.
