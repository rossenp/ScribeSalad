00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.240
<v 0>You're a young kid. I want to hurt you. Sometimes. I really do.</v>

2
00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:06.300
When I look at the videos, you know what I mean? I'm going to go, I, I,

3
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.350
I want to get, but I have to with it. Thank you, man, man. with it.

4
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.520
So when's the Netflix. When is it? It's out. It's out. Yeah, it's out now.

5
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.490
It's a, you guys should go check it out. Man. Is a Schultz. Saves America.

6
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.460
That's what it is. And then what else do you have going on? Nothing.

7
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.450
Yeah. Stand up or no, I haven't done any actually I have. Yeah.

8
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.750
And weirdly enough, I haven't desired it. Yeah.

9
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.410
I think like my creative juices were fueled by this project that just took so

10
00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:38.180
much time. Yeah, it was okay. And then weirdly enough,

11
00:00:38.181 --> 00:00:42.740
like doing pods, like in hanging around, not my own pod,

12
00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:43.880
but like doing other people's pods,

13
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.560
especially if there's like people in the room,

14
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.420
I start to miss stand up a little bit.

15
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.210
Cause it was almost feels like you're like, yeah,

16
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.890
I'm hearing you tell a funny story.

17
00:00:51.891 --> 00:00:54.650
Like even when you were telling me that story earlier in this podcast, I'm like,

18
00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:57.650
yeah, that'd be a good bit, man. There's like a lot. Cause it sounds,

19
00:00:57.651 --> 00:01:02.480
the story sounds like you're bragging about banging this hot chick. [inaudible]

20
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.650
I'm like, Oh man. At this deal on stage. Yeah. Yeah. But at the same time,

21
00:01:06.651 --> 00:01:11.510
I'm like, I'm not going to perform in like 20 degree weather on a roof. Yeah.

22
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.410
For me, it's not, I don't. Yeah. Like that's not how I want to do it.

23
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.310
People are like calling me, dude. There's a great beat show. And I go, well,

24
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.860
show me a photo. Right. And they're outside.

25
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.840
People are 500 feet away from the stage six feet apart. Right.

26
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.970
I need to hear laughter close. Comfortable.

27
00:01:31.971 --> 00:01:36.200
Yeah. You know, I'm the type of comic that like energy bro,

28
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.180
not energy dat. But also I like to, like, I like to grip people beyond the head.

29
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.910
I meant by like you feed off their energy, you got to connect to them. Yeah.

30
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.400
Yeah. Have you played the Denver comedy works. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

31
00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:53.540
You know how close they are. Right. I just like going what's up bro?

32
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.480
I'm here. You know what I mean? And like, you know what I mean,

33
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.720
40 on somebody or like, you know me doing what I do, you know what I mean?

34
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.690
But it's like, I can't do these vast, you know,

35
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.010
like I'm doing it like a mad max. You know what I mean? It feels spoken word.

36
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.800
Yeah. It feels like a little spoken word.

37
00:02:09.801 --> 00:02:13.400
Like you can go up there and you can like do your misdirection bits and stuff.

38
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.900
Yeah. Or like a joke,

39
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.720
like a story that has a big twist at the end or something and it will work.

40
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.740
But the connectivity is definitely different. And I thrive off that.

41
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:22.820
Like I want, when I'm with you,

42
00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:27.200
I want to feel your energy when I'm silent and you guys like waiting for the

43
00:02:27.201 --> 00:02:30.080
line, I want to feel that you also do a lot of improv too. I see.

44
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:31.610
You know what I mean. You know what I mean?

45
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:35.540
So how do you really riff and all that stuff when they're like 14 feet away?

46
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.090
Yeah. Yeah. What are you wearing? No, really what

47
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.220
it is, come back. That's why I'm not tripping about it.

48
00:02:43.221 --> 00:02:45.860
Like it's going to come back and then we'll be back out there. But like yeah.

49
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.730
And shout out to everybody who's doing the shows like in New York,

50
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.630
like the seller just closed. Then they started to do like these dinner shows.

51
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.380
But the whole time New York comedy club was like shout to Emilio.

52
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.480
They were hustling, dude. They started putting shows on and roofs man.

53
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:04.360
And in the summer it was fire. Like it was literally like Pete,

54
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:06.040
you could see across the river.

55
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.980
And like people are on this like lit roof and they were doing like,

56
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.100
they were finding outdoor areas. They just hustled, man.

57
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.420
It was so impressive to see. And um, obviously now it's cold, you know?

58
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.880
And it everything's shut down in New York again. It's annoying,

59
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:23.370
but I don't know. I, I just, I hope we can get back to it, man. I know.

60
00:03:23.371 --> 00:03:25.830
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's so rude. What happened? You got a call.

61
00:03:25.831 --> 00:03:30.090
You don't know how to turn your own an hour after

62
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.450
the first time it happened. I did it. I'm looking at you,

63
00:03:33.451 --> 00:03:38.250
but my eyes are not full. That's your bad. I have laser off. I know.

64
00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:41.520
I'm so sorry. I just turned it off. Another thing from the two plus.

65
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.100
So we're doing it Tuesday. Oh my gosh.
