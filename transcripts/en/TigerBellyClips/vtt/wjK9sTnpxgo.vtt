1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.810
<v 0>Do you think because it infuriates me all right.</v>

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.430
It infuriates me.

3
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.240
<v 1>I, it broke my heart. It breaks my heart to get,</v>

4
00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:13.220
to get my special pastor and broke my heart in hindsight is the best thing that

5
00:00:13.221 --> 00:00:14.390
ever happened to me because.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.870
<v 0>I'm gonna let you know Steve is, is that, I'll just say it.</v>

7
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.360
I was pitching a show at Netflix with Joe coy and the,

8
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.980
and how we Mendell is with us because he's producing the thing that joke

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.660
and how he's like these two are very good stand-ups and the executives in the

10
00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:36.890
room looked at me and they go, you do stand up to me.

11
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.690
And this is seven, eight months ago. Okay.

12
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.940
My heart cracked into my body and it melted into my soul. Right.

13
00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:51.410
My point is, is that don't take it personally, right? That they passed on it.

14
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.300
<v 1>I mean, of course I, you know, take it personally,</v>

15
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.660
even the guy who's in charge of buying comedy

16
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.380
specialists at Netflix even went so far as to, uh,

17
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.390
to explicitly say, I am a comedy snob.

18
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.070
And I only am interested in buying comedy specials from lifelong pure standup

19
00:01:16.071 --> 00:01:20.480
comedians of which I do not consider Steve-O to be. So it's like, Hey man,

20
00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:23.780
I got to at least give them credit for not sugarcoating.

21
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.460
Hey, you. But you know, you right up your. But,

22
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.930
but, uh, but, but Hey man, at least you, at least you just said what it was.

23
00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.520
And now I doubled down, I did the, the bucket list tour.

24
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.590
I just went all out now.

25
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.760
Now like one of my bucket list ideas was to go skydiving.

26
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.090
Butt-naked when the guys strapped on my back, the tandem dude,

27
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.860
while I'm jacking off and time it to that,

28
00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:58.900
I'm falling out of the airplane, blowing alone all over everybody. Yeah.

29
00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.833
And I did it.

30
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.820
It's called sky jacket. Okay.

31
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.950
<v 0>Okay. [inaudible] let me ask you something because it's like,</v>

32
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.290
if I'm masturbating, right. And I hear a little Creek, right.

33
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.070
Or a little wind, I get thrown off and imagine.

34
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.180
<v 1>A plane full of dudes, all pointing cameras at you. How do you,</v>

35
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.650
did you take Viagra? I took four Cialis tablets. Yeah. Here we go. Right.

36
00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:30.080
Did you watch porn? Yeah. I brought a portable DVD.

37
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.880
That was my [inaudible]. That was the one exception. Well,

38
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.270
because you're not going to get a wifi signal. 15,000 feet. Wait,

39
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.020
do you start drinking off in the plane? How long before the jump, um,

40
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.610
jump did this was the craziest part about it was that

41
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.800
like I had to,

42
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.730
there's a window of like,

43
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.190
was it two minutes window?

44
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.190
Where like, it's got to happen.

45
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.440
You got to leave the plane within that two minutes.

46
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.960
Otherwise you're not going to be over the drop zone. So I had to time it dude.

47
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.440
Oh my God. I had to time it, it had to, so I was like, okay,

48
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.370
give me three minutes. Notice,

49
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:19.300
give me one minute before the two minutes starts.

50
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.810
So they screamed T-minus three and I start going for it, man. Like,

51
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.880
uh, Oh yeah. And then dude, like I,

52
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.260
it was happy, dude. It was, it was, it was the most as far as like multimedia,

53
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:39.160
like where it's like a funny story to try and find the company that would sign

54
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:42.280
off on it. Trying to find the guy who was willing to be strapped to my back,

55
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.510
trying to logistically pull it off in a plane full of dudes. I actually,

56
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:47.344
how it happened,

57
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.210
like the most hilarious stand-up comedy bit and the footage to back it up is

58
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:54.160
just next level. But that's,

59
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.250
that's one of the many things I did for the bucket list tour.

60
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.140
And that was all happened while I was just sitting on the gnarly special.

61
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.980
Wow. I was just sitting on it and I was like, trying to figure it out. Like,

62
00:04:05.981 --> 00:04:08.980
okay, now how am I going to do know I spent so much money on it.

63
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:11.830
I can't just give it away. And even if I wasn't planning to give it away,

64
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:13.030
I can't put it on YouTube.

65
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:17.920
It won't last 60 seconds on there before they take it down. And you know,

66
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.170
and so it took me this long and only like just very recently, it just went up.

67
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.330
I'm figuring out the paywall, you know, it's streaming at Steve-O dot com and,

68
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.250
and to promote it, I bought a billboard and right here in Hollywood, wow.

69
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.360
I hired a crew like a,

70
00:04:35.361 --> 00:04:40.300
a construction crew that builds gas stations with two cranes that,

71
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.430
you know, I'll even tell you how much the billboard costs,

72
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.520
8,000 bucks just to rent a billboard.

73
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.600
And then two cranes, a whole construction crew.

74
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.560
They built this thing for me to stand on, like flew out, uh,

75
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.540
this killer photographer, the whole leg. And I hired a publicist of like,

76
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.100
you know, like at the end, by the time I got done, like getting the special out,

77
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.330
like I was totally $300,000 into, wow.

78
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.780
And now I'm going to do this billboard stunt where let's face it.

79
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.840
There a pretty strong chance that, uh,

80
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.270
I'm going to have to hire another criminal attorney.

81
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:19.230
<v 2>And.</v>

82
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.100
<v 1>The expenses are just going to get overwhelming. And I'm like,</v>

83
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.890
it, dude. I'm going to show those

84
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.280
who rejected this thing.

85
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.380
I'm going to make them going to force them to deal with the

86
00:05:35.381 --> 00:05:39.070
entire world. Knowing about mine gnarly special.

87
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.560
And I went up and then I got duct taped to that billboard. And within 48 hours,

88
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.270
I had articles online from variety,

89
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.790
vanity fair, rolling stone, TMZ,

90
00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:59.000
Buzzfeed deadline, CNN people, extra.

91
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.220
He online USA today. the whole,

92
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.540
God world knows about my gnarly comedy special.

93
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.470
And um, they, the cops,

94
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.450
all the people they showed up and they looked at us and they said, Oh, well,

95
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.570
there was no crime being committed here. He taped to his own billboard.

96
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.770
Yeah. He bought the thing like, which is crazy. And, and,

97
00:06:23.771 --> 00:06:27.850
and I did have a lawyer go over the contract with the billboard company and it's

98
00:06:27.851 --> 00:06:28.684
their dumb,

99
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.580
no language whatsoever about anything to do with that.

100
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.500
Plus the they approved,

101
00:06:35.501 --> 00:06:39.160
which was on the billboard was an image of me duck taped to the billboard.

102
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.890
All we did was duct tape me over for me.

103
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.590
Oh yeah. So they approved the art. Oh,

104
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.640
we didn't change. Yeah. Change the, the, the, uh,

105
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.490
approved image changed at all.

106
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.280
Since there's no crime here by what happened.

107
00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.420
And that was upsetting to me was that the, uh,

108
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:05.920
the fire department shows up right now. We kept our two cranes.

109
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.270
They're called cherry picker cranes.

110
00:07:07.271 --> 00:07:10.300
You see like the phone company guys in them, you know, it's like a little thing.

111
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.670
And, uh, we kept them on site so that we could take me down ourselves.

112
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.300
Like I didn't want to be involved in wasting the city's resources, you know,

113
00:07:19.301 --> 00:07:23.080
like, and so I had my construction team on site with the cranes.

114
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.960
When the first responders showed up, they went straight over. They said, Hey,

115
00:07:25.961 --> 00:07:27.520
there's nothing to worry about here.

116
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.620
He's on there with like five points of harness carabiners

117
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.410
clipped on the, the shelf.

118
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:40.180
He's standing on his like suspended by straps that are rated for over

119
00:07:40.181 --> 00:07:43.900
5,000 pounds of weight. Like he's, he's on there. We've got cranes.

120
00:07:43.901 --> 00:07:46.210
We can get them down. No problem. We don't want to waste your time.

121
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.460
The fire department sadly said,

122
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.850
we have to be the ones to get up for liability issues.

123
00:07:51.851 --> 00:07:55.600
We've got to take them down. And I'm like, Oh, this is what I didn't want.

124
00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.450
And when I heard that they have to take me down. I'd like,

125
00:07:58.451 --> 00:08:01.270
I got them to send me up at night. I cut away the tape. I was like, Hey guys,

126
00:08:01.271 --> 00:08:05.740
come on. Let's. And I did legitimately feel like,

127
00:08:05.741 --> 00:08:08.560
like a piece of for having the fire department working on,

128
00:08:08.561 --> 00:08:12.850
getting me down from my billboard. So what I did was I took, uh, uh,

129
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.080
the dopest photo that,

130
00:08:14.081 --> 00:08:18.070
that photographer I hired and flew out the dopest photo that he took.

131
00:08:18.071 --> 00:08:21.430
And I had it like cleaned up so that there wasn't a bunch of loud shin,

132
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.380
dope print. I bought a thousand of them. And, uh,

133
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.920
I saw them on my website for $25 a piece signed,

134
00:08:29.921 --> 00:08:33.340
everyone signed all thousand,

135
00:08:33.341 --> 00:08:36.070
went with within less than 48 hours. Yeah.

136
00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.040
And that was $25,000 raised,

137
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.780
which I matched with my own $25,000 for a

138
00:08:43.781 --> 00:08:48.400
total of $50,000 that today I donated to the Los

139
00:08:48.401 --> 00:08:52.870
Angeles fire department. Cool man. Yeah. So it's like, kind of like,

140
00:08:52.871 --> 00:08:57.780
I got to clean up my mess a little bit on the only part of the plan that sucked.

141
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:02.160
The one thing that tainted this Epic publicity stunt was the fire department

142
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:04.020
showed up in and had to waste their time on me.

143
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.980
And so I donated 50 grand to them today.

144
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:09.720
And that was the last I was driving. I was,

145
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:14.160
I posted the while I was driving here. I hate to be texting and driving.

146
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:20.040
I was grabbing dude. I grabbed my picture of me with the fire chief dude,

147
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:24.420
holding up this obnoxious oversight and on the check I'm.

148
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.880
<v 0>Duct tape. Yeah.</v>

149
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.770
<v 1>I'm so stoked on it, man. And, um, United starts.</v>

150
00:09:30.771 --> 00:09:33.690
So I feel good about that part of it and, and. Yeah,

151
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:38.670
like here and dad, I shouldn't even like, I should just let it be,

152
00:09:38.671 --> 00:09:41.070
but, but the thing is that the,

153
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.180
everybody who rejected my special,

154
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:51.030
the quarter million part that I spent producing it, I mean,

155
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.990
I'll just say I sat on the thing for two and a half years.

156
00:09:54.991 --> 00:09:58.650
I taped it in January of 2018. Wow.

157
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:01.350
So come all this time later,

158
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:05.520
that quarter million it's been out the door so long ago,

159
00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:09.630
I don't even consider it missing. You know, I was like, dude,

160
00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:14.010
anything I get for this from distributing it on my own website.

161
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:17.370
It's all bonus. It's all gravy. I think you'll get it back.

162
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.280
I already had it back by the time I was on the billboard.

163
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.240
And, and uh, and I,

164
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.240
I already had brought in over $300,000 in revenue

165
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.640
by the time that the cherry picker cranes went up with the curve that attached

166
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.920
me to the billboard. And, um, that,

167
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:42.210
that was when I'd started kicking more

168
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:48.240
because of the whole world knew about it and them,

169
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.200
not the fire department. everybody didn't believe in this.

170
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:54.230
<v 0>I want to ask you a question though.</v>

171
00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:00.590
<v 1>Yeah. And, and, and you know what, like I'll even say, I'm crazy to say this.</v>

172
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.840
I don't, you know, like, uh,

173
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:07.880
if people stream streaming for nine 99 at Steve-O dot com.

174
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:12.890
<v 0>See right now he's our boy. I love him so much. He's so funny.</v>

175
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.320
go to his website and stream gnarly.

176
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.660
<v 1>Yeah, no, like I hired the same anti-piracy company that all the movie</v>

177
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.230
studios hire, you know, like they, they just said, candidly,

178
00:11:27.231 --> 00:11:29.390
it's not possible to completely scrub it away.

179
00:11:29.391 --> 00:11:32.720
If people are really determined to, to watch it for free, they will.

180
00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.470
And if people don't want and don't have nine 99 and they want to them up by all

181
00:11:36.471 --> 00:11:39.110
means, go for it. But I did everything in my power to make that difficult,

182
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:44.150
to make it just easier to pay the nine 99. I would appreciate it if people did,

183
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:49.130
because I really have, I have a ax to grind and, and,

184
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.210
and you know,

185
00:11:50.211 --> 00:11:54.770
the other thing how my first special was all about journey to

186
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.130
learn how to have a healthy relationship.

187
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.960
The last thing that happened on stage at this, on this new, special,

188
00:12:01.961 --> 00:12:03.250
the gnarly special,

189
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:07.170
the last thing that happens on that stage is I get on my knee and I proposed to

190
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.190
my girl in front, Oh, family and friends. When does the wedding?

191
00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:13.830
We don't have a date yet because we're,

192
00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:18.450
we're determined to buy a property and open up our own animal sanctuary,

193
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:23.490
EV we're going to get married on that Khalilah. And I invited to the wedding.

194
00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.880
Absolutely. We are going to go 100%. Absolutely.

195
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:31.170
<v 3>It might be the only wedding I look forward to just because it's an animal</v>

196
00:12:31.171 --> 00:12:32.004
sanctuary.

197
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.420
<v 1>We're not having kids because one of my bucket list items was called the</v>

198
00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:40.380
vasectomy Olympics. It's tied up,

199
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:42.000
add snipped it's knit.

200
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.240
You can extract from the balls extract from the balls. You can't extract it.

201
00:12:48.241 --> 00:12:52.710
I don't know. I think you should have children. No,

202
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.880
I honestly think it would be a good, great father. Listen,

203
00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:59.460
because look at how far you've come.
