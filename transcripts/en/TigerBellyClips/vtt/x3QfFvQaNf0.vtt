00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.870
<v 0>Oh, yeah. So I had to do press for Ontario, right?</v>

2
00:00:03.871 --> 00:00:07.800
So I could say it's one radio station, which is a good one.

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.110
What's that called? Patty Hamilton. Yeah. It's a great morning news shell.

4
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.100
I've done it before, but it's like five in the morning.

5
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.160
I'm like I have to go to Culver city and then go straight from Culver city to

6
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:23.460
Ontario to do shows. And they got me a hotel room.

7
00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:28.380
So I could sleep all during the day, like five in the morning. I called Abby,

8
00:00:28.381 --> 00:00:31.230
Abby was in New York, my manager and I go, I can't do it.

9
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.093
There's no way I can do it.

10
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.570
<v 1>They're ready for you. You said you would, you said you would do.</v>

11
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.140
<v 0>And I made a deal. I go, I'll go on the next three auditions.</v>

12
00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:43.280
No matter what it is, I'll go in physically. Fine.

13
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.700
If you get me out of this. So she got me out down.

14
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.850
So sometimes when you talk to people, you have to give them, you know,

15
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.640
you have to negotiate, you get to tell them deals and I'm a deal maker.

16
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.660
<v 1>Um, and Trump, and imagine trying to make deals with a deal-maker.</v>

17
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.910
So what I have to do is I have to play the game. So if I want him, for instance,

18
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.620
if I, if I desperately want him to see a doctor, yeah, I will.

19
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.240
I will make sure that there's on audition that day that he,

20
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.150
he wants to get out of. And he, so that he'll be like, okay, rough fight.

21
00:01:17.151 --> 00:01:18.650
I'd rather go to the doctor. Yes.

22
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.660
But I will fabricate an audition so that he thinks

23
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.460
the doctor is a good deal. Do you know this? That she's fabricating. Yeah. No,

24
00:01:28.461 --> 00:01:31.370
he doesn't. No, he doesn't. Oh, he does.

25
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.040
<v 0>Cause I still believe right. That, um,</v>

26
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.440
S O D auditions and I went on how many I went on some film ones this year. Yeah.

27
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.630
Yeah. I, I tested for that Regency one.

28
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.430
I'd went in there and I did that one other one help you read for that one. Yeah.

29
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.630
Do you see one? Yeah. I've sent someone a song. It's just like, you know,

30
00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:58.220
it's not, I'm not getting any clothes. I'm not cleaning in claws. And um,

31
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.870
you know, it disturbs me because, um, you know, people say all the time,

32
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.960
it's your time to me. And I go, what do you mean?

33
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.491
And they go, you know,

34
00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:15.380
cause of crazy rich Asians and all these other things like being Asian

35
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.180
is hot right now, but pop Noah calling Papa.

36
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.110
Right. And then when I talk to other ones, like the other ones,

37
00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:28.850
like Jimmy O yang or Alec, Oh yeah. We got 50 movies coming out. Right?

38
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.930
Yeah. We got like, you know, I mean, we got everything. Right. And then,

39
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.810
you know, I look at someone like Joe coy and I,

40
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.530
and Margaret show as to yeah.

41
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.380
And I have to reiterate and stress how

42
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.170
important it was for someone like Margaret to hit the scene when she hit it.

43
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.590
You know? Um, when I started,

44
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.060
not only were there no auditions for Asians, we couldn't even get stage

45
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.190
right in the nineties. Like there wasn't a lot.

46
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.200
And the ones that here's the thing, Asian comics before I started,

47
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.490
a lot of them got up on stage only because of the fact that they had an accent.

48
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.730
You mean, or they, you know,

49
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.450
it wasn't the necessarily the road jokes to get laughs.

50
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.650
People would just laugh at them. You're like, like the old Johnny Yoon thing.

51
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:27.430
I said, when he, his applause break when he said hot, all right.

52
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.770
So it was much harder. I'm not blowing steam up my.

53
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.000
I'm just, I just, this is the reality of, it was difficult.

54
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:38.980
<v 2>Argue with the fact that, but.</v>

55
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.200
<v 0>That's the thing it's like, I know, but the thing is, is that like,</v>

56
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.050
but now that it's easy, it's hard for me.

57
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.250
<v 2>Hey, sorry to interrupt guys. But we have an amazing sponsor</v>

58
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.040
[inaudible] future in your pocket all day long.

59
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:57.990
<v 0>You guys, uh,</v>

60
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.730

61
00:04:02.731 --> 00:04:06.360
use is this it's called the Ridge wallet. Amazing. Right?
