00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.660
<v 0>Okay. All right. So anyway, um, I know you don't like,</v>

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.673
um, hi.

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.740
<v 1>You don't like compliments. Um, you get a little uneasy about compliments,</v>

4
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.050
so I just try not to swung it your way. Um.

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.150
<v 0>Yeah. Why can't we just keep doing what we're doing here,</v>

6
00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.753
because I think that'd be way more.

7
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.880
<v 1>It wouldn't be tiger belly if I didn't, you know what I mean?</v>

8
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.950
It's a little weird, but, um, I'm just gonna tell you how I discovered you.

9
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.580
<v 0>You know, I, I do all my whole career to you.</v>

10
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.930
I was struggling until Bobby Lee died.

11
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.280
<v 1>No, no, no. Not discover you in terms of like, you did it on your own,</v>

12
00:00:40.281 --> 00:00:44.690
obviously, but no, in terms of, by my awareness of you. Oh,

13
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.830
can I tell you that story?

14
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.580
<v 0>I remember it was a big day in my career. Bobby Lee is finally,</v>

15
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.680
am I on Bobby? Lee's radar? See, this is what he's going to,

16
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.200
this is when things start to happen.

17
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.330
<v 1>I'm not gonna allow this reverse. I'm not, yeah.</v>

18
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.240
I'm not gonna allow this to happen. I'm just gonna plug away.

19
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.343
You know what I mean?

20
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.590
<v 0>You can talk to him all you want. I can hear it.</v>

21
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.450
Like sea glass. It's not soundproof.

22
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.920
<v 1>So years ago, years ago, um, I had no idea who you were. And, um,</v>

23
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.100
I was in a car with Steve Byrne and Ken Jong.

24
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.070
And we're driving from San Francisco to LA.

25
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.000
Cause we had to do gigs together at that time because we couldn't draw on our

26
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:30.170
own. And so, uh, Steven loved Oasis,

27
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.470
but we kept playing. Oh, waste is over, over again. Like he.

28
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.690
<v 0>Still does. I know. Right?</v>

29
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.710
<v 1>It's like give it a rest. Right? They have three songs,</v>

30
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.410
good songs, champagne supernova, wonder wall and some other one.

31
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.480
Okay. That's it great songs, but that's it. So he and I,

32
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.090
we go, what would we listen to? And he goes, well,

33
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:56.450
I have a friend from New York, you know, he [inaudible], we have,

34
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.320
I have his comedy CD.

35
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.620
<v 0>And we're like, we just said, well, I want to this no comedy right now.</v>

36
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.100
We're eight hours in the. Open micros, seat or whatever. Right.

37
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.790
<v 1>He puts it in. None of it was a very funny,</v>

38
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.510
but there was one bit about you and the subway.

39
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.620
And then you saw some guy pick a girl up and then your high pitched voice,

40
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.370
you mean by the back of the bed, right? Yeah.

41
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.940
And we laughed so hard and that's when you know what I mean, when I, Oh,

42
00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:30.240
bill Burr, bill broke the bill Burr. And then, um, now.

43
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.300
<v 0>One of the greatest comics on the planet,</v>

44
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.610
how does that feel? What was that character?

45
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.650
I don't even take. No, I'm plugging away. I'm doing all right.

46
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.350
You doing all right? Well, it's great.

47
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.070
<v 1>Because of the fact that it's like, you know, here's the, here's the deal?</v>

48
00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:54.350
The honest truth is this. Okay.

49
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.910
<v 0>I just loved that whole body line. Okay. Here's here's the deal here. Let's get,</v>

50
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.370
let's get real.

51
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.390
<v 1>So, um, you know, I'm almost 50 and I feel like, um,</v>

52
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.050
things are kind of slowly happening for me as well. Right.

53
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.550
It's just nice to see like.

54
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.570
<v 0>You, but you've been on television for like almost 30 years.</v>

55
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.220
<v 1>What are you talking about? Mad TV. Oh my God. Okay. First of all,</v>

56
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.730
Matt TV was like doing community theater. That's how much we got paid.

57
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.990
<v 0>I'm not, I'm just telling you. I know.</v>

58
00:03:24.991 --> 00:03:26.880
Did you get over in show business?

59
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.530
Did you think that was a big pot of gold and then somebody else took it from

60
00:03:31.531 --> 00:03:34.350
you? Yeah. That's what happens, but you was still on TV.

61
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.990
You still walk down the street and people are like, Oh my God,

62
00:03:36.991 --> 00:03:39.300
it's Bobby Lee from mad TV.

63
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.100
<v 1>Fine, fine. You're right. And I'm grateful. Okay. But I'm just saying.</v>

64
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.190
<v 0>The empathy that I have for you right now. It's just,</v>

65
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.430
how much of your day is trying to pick this up

66
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.120
and keep it buoyant.

67
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.240
<v 1>See the thing about him though.</v>

68
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.980
<v 0>Yeah, go ahead. I feel like I'm getting cross-examined.</v>

69
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.280
<v 1>He, he has a ways he he's one of those guys like Whitney. It was like that too.</v>

70
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.750
When she sees me behaving in a certain way to garner some sort of sympathy

71
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.560
sympathy, or, you know, I I'm do something psychological. Right.

72
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.910
So I can get something out of some and he sees through it where other people,

73
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.310
they fall into it and they go, Oh no, you know what I mean? And they,

74
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.473
you know what I mean?

75
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.700
<v 0>I've just been around a lot of dirtbags. So I</v>

76
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.850
I've been taking advantage of a couple of times. I know when it's happening.

77
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.580
<v 1>Yeah. But you could see through it, but I'm just saying that, um,</v>

78
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.330
let's go back to what I was doing originally, which is, um,

79
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.120
you're doing well and congratulate.

80
00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.330
<v 0>That's all I wanted to say. Thank you. I appreciate that. I appreciate that.</v>

81
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.090
<v 1>B you're killing it. I love the Mandalorian right here. All of a sudden,</v>

82
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.290
I didn't even know you were on it. And when you're watching something you love,

83
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.060
right. And that you see a guy that, you know, up there killing it, you go,

84
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.650
Oh my God, it's crazy. Right. And then like, and then he's in the, the, the,

85
00:05:07.651 --> 00:05:07.831
the,

86
00:05:07.831 --> 00:05:12.780
the avatar movie and a bunch of know he's killing

87
00:05:12.781 --> 00:05:14.130
it. That's all I wanted to say.

88
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.620
<v 0>I caught up to you.</v>

89
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.690
<v 1>Why don't comics? Why do comics not like compliments?</v>

90
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.320
<v 0>I know. I think some of them do, look, I respect,</v>

91
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.270
you know, other comics liking what I do. I do enjoy that,

92
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.870
but I don't want to sit here and just like, listen to that.

93
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.680
You're giving him the worst experience. I just want to like,

94
00:05:37.681 --> 00:05:42.060
hang out and whoever's watching this. You don't have to go James Lipton

95
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.730
when you did that joke on comedy central.

96
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.170
<v 1>Yeah. But because this is your first time on this podcast. Right. So I just,</v>

97
00:05:52.171 --> 00:05:53.130
I need to get that out of there.

98
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.530
<v 0>I'm a big fan of it too. I always put the little heart on all clips.</v>

99
00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:59.240
I always think, I always think it's funny.

100
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.680
<v 1>Thank you. And so, you know, from now on, when you do it,</v>

101
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.270
I will never bring it up. Right.

102
00:06:04.271 --> 00:06:07.870
I just had to say it in a way to put it on record. Oh,

103
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.120
put one on record that I, you know, the, uh, how I discovered you and you know,

104
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.580
[inaudible], This is going to be how, you know, how I feel about you. You know,

105
00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.270
I feel just real good Tingley, warm feelings towards you. That's all. Thank you.

106
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.220
Yeah. And I think you're doing great stuff. That's all.

107
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.570
<v 0>Talk about it.</v>

108
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.990
Whoever knew that my career would come down to a car full of Asians driving.

109
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.120
So German,

110
00:06:34.121 --> 00:06:38.950
Irish guy from Massachusetts who knew I needed the West coast Asian

111
00:06:38.951 --> 00:06:41.860
connection. Hey guys,

112
00:06:41.861 --> 00:06:44.680
we're taking a really quick break to talk about one of our favorite sponsors,

113
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.090
Glenn in USA each and every

114
00:06:49.091 --> 00:06:51.850
day. You guys, Brooklyn, right?

115
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:55.980

116
00:06:55.981 --> 00:07:00.220
we use Brooklyn in our house and it just makes our relationship and our lives

117
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:01.420
more comfortable.
