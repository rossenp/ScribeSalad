00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
<v 0>I want to talk about what the happened to our TV show. Uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.280
Oh Jesus, here we go. Here we go. What we,

3
00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:12.930
you and I go to every network, right?

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.530
Do we on Hollywood? No, no, no, we don't on it. We're not on it,

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.611
but you and okay.

6
00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:21.390
Well then why do we see shows that shouldn't even stand a chance against you?

7
00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:24.810
And I get on, why are we having such a hard time selling?

8
00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:28.620
We have so much power behind us saying that, that it should be on. I know.

9
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.880
So you and I go with, what is it with Howie Mendell, right. And we go to,

10
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.590
I'm going to give any names, but yeah, who's a friend. He's not like a enemy.

11
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.890
Well, I just don't want people like out there to be like, Oh, they're dropping.

12
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:43.790
I was just saying, dropping anything. I'm just at this Dean.

13
00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:46.460
And I'm not seeing that people, I don't want to call anybody out. Like,

14
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.440
like yeah. We walked into the room with a lot of power. Yeah. Alright.

15
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.520
So we, and we have our agencies behind us. We think we have a good idea.

16
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.680
And um, I think don't say I know and we, and we've done it. We've done it.

17
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.430
We've done it. We did it seven years ago too. Yeah.

18
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.090
And they still know it's been a part of our life. And then we thought,

19
00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:08.901
we thought, you know,

20
00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:12.050
him and I are growing in our own different ways in terms of the business and

21
00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:14.420
whatnot. And in our audiences and stuff,

22
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.290
we thought that combined you and I share some audience, but we have different,

23
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.450
you know, audience. And, um, we thought that with that, you know,

24
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.230
that we come back this year and try to sell this thing. And still like,

25
00:01:27.231 --> 00:01:31.670
there was just no traction. Really? I don't get it. I don't get it either.

26
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.130
You guys pitched it during the beginning of the pandemic. No way, but Oh yeah.

27
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.940
It doesn't matter when we pitch it. There's something that's just not,

28
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.550
I don't know what it is with Hollywood man. It's it's mind boggling to me. Um,

29
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.450
it really is. And it hurts my feelings. Yeah. It hurts my feelings.

30
00:01:50.451 --> 00:01:53.480
That's the only thing. And I, and I say hurts my feelings because it's like,

31
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.060
cause I know that we are amazing together individually

32
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.860
and together, we're enormous funny together. And we deserve it.

33
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.620
Like, you know what I mean? And it's, and it's like,

34
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.400
I guess we have to pay for it ourselves again. It's like,

35
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.950
that's the kind of world we live in. Why? Yeah.

36
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.720
Why I don't mind doing it and I will. It's going to happen. Yeah. But whatever,

37
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:22.310
man. it, dude. No, I don't. I'm not letting it go because,

38
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.720
because by talking about it too, because believe it or not, you know,

39
00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:30.920
I know a lot of people that are in the business that are like in, you know,

40
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.000
the studio and the, and the network sides of things that listen to this,

41
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.450
you know? And so they do no, but that,

42
00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:42.590
that, that's what you call a humblebrag. No,

43
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.950
I'm not saying no because I've humbly bragged about no,

44
00:02:45.951 --> 00:02:50.150
but I've been at T we're CA cable reads and an executive come after me after

45
00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:54.570
the, you know, may go Nosotras papaya or, or, or they'll say, you know, uh,

46
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.340
a catchphrase from tiger Valley. Right? So it's like, man, you, no,

47
00:02:58.341 --> 00:03:00.850
that's not what I'm saying. I'm good telling you at that.

48
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:03.250
Does it tell you that we get it movies?

49
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.460
Maybe you can make your case on here that we're trying to make a case on here.

50
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.310
That's basically what I'm saying. That everything needs to be defensive.

51
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.650
Not everything has to be a twist. You're the only one that's doing it. I think.

52
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.760
Nope. There's the jury's over there and you're convincing them.

53
00:03:17.761 --> 00:03:21.270
You're not guilty, judge.

54
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.820
How am I doing? Am I the one that no, I will say you're moving a lot.

55
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.180
He's had his legs in the same position the whole time. That's all I observed.

56
00:03:30.181 --> 00:03:34.110
So you're saying that my body language is in the defensive moving a lot.

57
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.720
I'm just a high energy kind of a guy. He can't be the first to, to attack you.

58
00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:40.554
I'm not attacking you.

59
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.190
He's been placing his proudest shoe in front of me camera this whole time.

60
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.260
Why didn't you wear the golden goose? Why didn't you wear my golden goose,

61
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.950
Gucci glasses. Those are dope. My shoes match my jacket. Yeah.

62
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.030
So, um, what I'm saying is that I think that we should still fight for the,

63
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.590
you know, I, yeah, man, I even told Holly I'm willing to put up money for it.

64
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.460
Yeah. And just make it, you know, I still get a little, you know,

65
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.380
but I think this is a part of just being in a up business that we're

66
00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:19.740
in. Yeah. And the kind of people that we are, you know, I,

67
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.420
there is a layer of sense of sensitivity that I have. Right. So it's like.
