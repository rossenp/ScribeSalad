00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.470
<v 0>Sometimes I'm asked about how to resolve relationship conflict.</v>

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.080
And I find this amusing and I'm smiling because this has never been a

3
00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:13.770
strong suit for me, as it relates to intimate relationships,

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.600
I am not famous for my patients and have caused innumerable

5
00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:21.060
problems in my relationships as a result of that,

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.460
and grew up at least through schooling and coaching with very little

7
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:28.800
positive reinforcement, a lot of negative reinforcement,

8
00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:30.180
which also doesn't help matters.

9
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.920
But I have found a few different approaches and frameworks,

10
00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:39.840
perhaps tools also that have helped me greatly personally,

11
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.260
to be a better partner to my girlfriend, for instance,

12
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.750
and also tools that help us together as a couple to

13
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:51.180
resolve conflict. It's not about avoiding conflict.

14
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.440
I think that there's a certain amount of conflict that can be avoided,

15
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:59.640
but whenever you are spending 24 seven together or in close proximity,

16
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.310
you are going to have friction in the system.

17
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.850
And that is certainly true with even my closest,

18
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.520
maybe especially my closest guy, friends,

19
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.310
but let's talk about the tools first.

20
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.710
I believe that to minimize conflict or quickly resolve,

21
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.100
like you need to first become more aware of your yeah.

22
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.480
Internal States and become more aware of the stories that you create

23
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.950
in your head,

24
00:01:27.951 --> 00:01:31.970
the loops that you play that will inform how you interact with someone else.

25
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.620
Because if, for instance,

26
00:01:33.621 --> 00:01:37.160
you create a story where you were always the victim and that is your pattern

27
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.960
that will greatly affect how you approach any type of conflict resolution or

28
00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:46.700
discussion and two tools. I found very, very helpful for that. On number one,

29
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.630
Sam, Harris's waking up app. I highly recommend getting it.

30
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.010
I have no skin in the game, no equity, no pay off, no kickbacks, nothing.

31
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.040
So Sam Harris is waking up,

32
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.280
which provides a logical progression of skill development

33
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.560
in meditation, or really self-awareness that's number one,

34
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.280
it gives you a 10 minute practice each day that I, I do in the mornings.

35
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.220
I still use this app. I've run through it multiple times.

36
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.540
It's accepted that pairs very well with a book called awareness.

37
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.050
And for some reason it has multiple subtitles depending on the format.

38
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.010
One of them is I believe the promises and perils of reality,

39
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.470
the other is conversations with the masters,

40
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.410
but that doesn't make any sense because there's really only one author and that

41
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:34.970
is Anthony de Mello. So the book title is awareness, the author,

42
00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:38.390
Anthony DeMello, D E M E L L O,

43
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.160
who was as a Jesuit priest and also a second therapist.

44
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.380
Very interesting combination.

45
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.540
And that book will also help you to recognize,

46
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.700
uh, the stories,

47
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.440
the movies you're creating as an interpretation of events.

48
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.700
It will also help you to become very bluntly,

49
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.120
honest with yourself in self-assessment, uh,

50
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.040
so that you are able to spot where you genuinely

51
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:13.720
want to fix problems or where you are more wedded to

52
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:18.550
drama, perhaps. And those two tools combined,

53
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.720
especially have been incredibly valuable for me. And that's kind of step one.

54
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.460
Uh, my girlfriend has also gone through both of these and it's helped us to

55
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:31.960
pause because between the stimulus and your response,

56
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:36.550
there is a gap and in the gap is where everything can

57
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:37.960
change. Uh,

58
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.010
that's where you get to choose your response to be response able. Okay.

59
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.180
So step number one is really working on your self to be a better partner.

60
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.100
Then as a couple, uh, thinking,

61
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.600
having a very candid assessment of your sensitivities and pet peeves

62
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.470
is very important. For instance, my girlfriend, at some point,

63
00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:03.270
this was maybe six months ago, nine months ago asked me about wordsmithing.

64
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.380
She wanted to know how she could craft feedback in the perfect way.

65
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.720
She didn't phrase it that way, but in a better way,

66
00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:13.290
such that I would be more receptive to certain types of feedback.

67
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.390
And we were doing a quarterly couples work,

68
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.260
which I also recommend. So having some type of facilitator, like a therapist,

69
00:04:22.261 --> 00:04:26.490
at least once a quarter to assist with a

70
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.460
couples a day that we block out, we do this once a quarter.

71
00:04:29.461 --> 00:04:33.570
And during one of those sessions, I said, it's not about the content.

72
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.870
It's about the timing. And I think this is true for a lot of couples,

73
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.450
rather than having things piecemeal throughout the day.

74
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.430
It is helpful for some of us, especially someone like me who is, uh,

75
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.630
wedded to structure and predictability as much as possible.

76
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.660
You might not think that might not expect that, but it's true on a daily basis,

77
00:04:51.661 --> 00:04:54.540
I thrive with structure and I said,

78
00:04:54.541 --> 00:04:58.440
it doesn't matter what the wordsmithing is. You could be,

79
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.700
you could be Tolstoy, you could be no buck off. It doesn't matter. I,

80
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.680
I need things to be timed in a particular way. Uh,

81
00:05:07.681 --> 00:05:12.150
that would be my preference. And so we set aside on a say,

82
00:05:12.151 --> 00:05:15.630
weekly or bi-weekly basis, a batching session,

83
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.670
and the batching session allows us to discuss what it is that

84
00:05:20.671 --> 00:05:24.780
we need, uh, what it is that it's bothering us and the framework,

85
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.060
or I should say the format we've used.

86
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.070
And I am not aware of any reading we've done that has informed

87
00:05:32.071 --> 00:05:32.371
this way.

88
00:05:32.371 --> 00:05:37.260
It was trial and error is we first talk about what the

89
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.080
other person is doing. Well, what we love,

90
00:05:40.081 --> 00:05:44.310
what we'd love more of right now, what we love more of is going to come again.

91
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.240
But what the other person, what our partners doing well, uh,

92
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.480
then we talk about what we think we're doing well personally.

93
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.140
And then we talk about what we would like even more of, okay.

94
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.030
Rather than saying what you're up, what you're up, what's driving me crazy.

95
00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.541
It's like, you know what?

96
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:04.340
I would really enjoy more of what would really make me happy to get more of his

97
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.710
ex. And that type of very simple format has worked for us.

98
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.480
And it is recorded, not necessarily audio recorded,

99
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:18.380
but the, the takeaways, the homework assignments are recorded.

100
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.880
You could use something like Evernote.

101
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:24.020
You could use notes so that there's follow-up without follow-up.

102
00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:26.450
This is all in the wind. So you need followups.

103
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.090
There are then the meeting notes,

104
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.170
so to speak from this batching session and we each get a copy.

105
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.440
And this way we can do two things, we can refer back to it.

106
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.130
So that for the next, at least several days,

107
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:42.350
following that batch batching session, refer to that,

108
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:44.150
say in the mornings as a reminder.

109
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.710
And then when we do our next batching session, we can see how we've done.

110
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.670
We can look at the, at the assignment and then the report card,

111
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.880
and sometimes I'll fall short and I'll be like, ah, God, you know,

112
00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:57.770
I was supposed to do that. I totally blank. I'm so sorry.

113
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.830
There's an accountability. That is really important. All right.

114
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:02.390
So we've talked about a couple of things so far,

115
00:07:02.391 --> 00:07:06.590
we talked about waking up at Sam Harris. We talked about awareness,

116
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.620
Anthony de Mello. We've talked about batching sessions.

117
00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:13.400
And I also mentioned in passing these quarterly couples days,

118
00:07:13.401 --> 00:07:15.320
it's an entire day set aside.

119
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.560
Let's just call it from like 10:00 AM to 8:00 PM,

120
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:23.120
something like that to talk and to have some type of facilitation.

121
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.380
And it can be very freeform in this case, there's less structure.

122
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.140
It's really just talking about whatever's on our mind. Whatever our wants are,

123
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.880
are our needs being met, are things bothering us, our, our desires, being that,

124
00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:39.200
whatever it might be. And, uh, for me, at least, uh,

125
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:43.790
these tools and having this type of structure

126
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:47.690
has been invaluable. And last but not least as my friend,

127
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.620
[inaudible] one of the best investors and entrepreneurs I know has said,

128
00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:55.640
and I'm going to paraphrase. Uh, if you want to avoid conflict,

129
00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:00.440
step number one is, do not associate with people who are always in conflict,

130
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.550
right? So choose your friends, choose your partners very wisely.

131
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.120
You are going to be the average of the five people you associate with most.

132
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.180
So choose wisely. Good luck.
