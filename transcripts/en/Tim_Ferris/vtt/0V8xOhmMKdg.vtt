<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.370
<v 1>I would say for me, I don't understand how you do something halfway.</v>

3
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.350
I did that through high school and doing that.

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.690
I saw the, I saw the instant consequence. You know,

5
00:00:20.691 --> 00:00:22.670
there was a moment where after high school,

6
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.680
where my friends went on and they started going to

7
00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:31.160
college and I was the guy that didn't even know that we apply.

8
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.890
I didn't know who was applying to college. When a job,

9
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.850
I thought we used to playing all this time, where were y'all going?

10
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.930
What was the joke to me was never a joke to anybody else.

11
00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:45.550
I was the only one that the joke was being played on.

12
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.540
So when I thought we were hooking in or cutting class, well,

13
00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:52.130
I thought we all weren't going to work.

14
00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:57.050
I thought we all were or getting by and just off

15
00:00:57.051 --> 00:01:01.160
opportunities. Oh, it's just me. Oh,

16
00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:05.000
y'all been doing your work this whole time. Oh. Huh.

17
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.613
Wow.

18
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.030
University of university of university of,

19
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.520
I was the only that was going to community college and that's not to take a shot

20
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.230
at anybody. Who's going to community college.

21
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.780
Cause those colleges are available for a reason.

22
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.290
I was doing a that didn't have a plan because I thought that was the cool thing

23
00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:28.220
to do. So I saw it not working hard. Got me.

24
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.370
I didn't take my sat.

25
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.590
I did abracadabra going down and guessing at it because I thought that's what we

26
00:01:36.591 --> 00:01:38.960
all were doing because we were hooking in class to go.

27
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.650
I was the only day kid that did it the other way.

28
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.380
So that joke was on me. That to me,

29
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.340
that was an eye-opener man. Well, if I'm going to do something,

30
00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:56.900
I should never do a halfway. And that means that if I do want to do it that way,

31
00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.830
I shouldn't do it.

32
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.750
And I'm not going to do it to show what I can do at the best of my business.

33
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.920
Then why am I doing it? If you asked me to come and work out what you can.

34
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.020
I come work out and I the workout while I go work out.

35
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.620
Have you asked me to come see a movie? And I go to sleep.

36
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.800
As soon as I get in there or while I go to the movie, why don't I just say,

37
00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:19.580
I want to stay home. Have you asked me to go and get up early with you?

38
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.560
So we can go look at these, these apartments or, or housing complexes.

39
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.160
And I get down there and it's got a negative attitude, but why the did I go?

40
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.960
What I've learned and how I operate is that you're in so much

41
00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:37.400
control of yourself. That it's ridiculous.

42
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.650
And sometimes it's easy to put out excuses for yourself.

43
00:02:42.651 --> 00:02:46.970
That makes sense to you. We all know the truth.

44
00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:51.440
We all know if we're giving a hundred percent. If we're not, we all know

45
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.140
you tell me, go outside and pick up the dog. My wife tells me every morning,

46
00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.170
I don't want to go out there and pick the dog, but I get up and do it.

47
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.760
If I go out there and I take two steps and I'm like minutes too early,

48
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:09.430
I do this later. Then that means that I'm,

49
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.860
I I'm already compromising an action that I said I was going

50
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:19.150
to do that. I'm not, if I sound want to do something,

51
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:23.140
I'm going to do it. If I don't say it don't expect it from me.

52
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.060
I never put my foot in my mouth. But what do you expect me to go do that?

53
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.680
I never said I would do that. That's the one power that I have.

54
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.130
That's the one thing that can never be taken from me.

55
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.160
What I say I'm going to do. I do.

56
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.100
And if I do do something that puts me in a position

57
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.920
to be scolded because my actions weren't correct.

58
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.270
Then I got to stand up and I got to say that too. Hey,

59
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.090
I said I was going to do X, Y, and Z.

60
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.040
I didn't do it. I got to wear that.

61
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.560
Hat hit me with the stupid sticker. The dummy hat schooled me,

62
00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:07.720
whatever you got to do. I up,

63
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.750
I out loud said that I would do. And I did to that. I'm wrong.

64
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.040
That's the difference. That's what I'm okay with.

65
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.790
I'm okay with staying in the and smelling it. If I have to,

66
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.540
I try my best to avoid it, but I'm not perfect.

67
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.220
So there's ever a moment where that happens and it has to happen though.

68
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.320
I'm on it. But as I've gotten older, my words become more.

69
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.420
My bond take care of me. I want you to come talk to these kids, man. Look,

70
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.540
there's a group of kids with pay. I can't do that now because of the kids.

71
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.810
I'm tired. That's was at time where I can.

72
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.870
There was a time back in the day. Capital Dalton. Yay.

73
00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:53.620
I forgot you can't get me on the phone. Well, why do I say I can do it?

74
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.800
I've learned from that. I don't, I don't play those games.

75
00:04:56.801 --> 00:04:59.800
So if I say you're going to get me, you're going to get a hundred percent of me.

76
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.910
If I don't feel like I can, then I'm not going to say.
