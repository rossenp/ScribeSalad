00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:06.060
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.460
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

<v 1>Books.</v>

5
00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:28.940
I've loved on the Tim Ferriss show is exclusively brought to you by audible.

6
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.010
There couldn't be a better sponsor for this series.

7
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:35.000
My dear listeners and readers I've used audible for so many years,

8
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.890
as long as I can remember. I love it.

9
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.070
Audible has the largest selection of audio books on the planet.

10
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.580
I listen when I'm taking walks. I listen while I'm cooking.

11
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.180
I listen whenever I can. And if you're looking for a place to start,

12
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.730
I can recommend three of my favorites.

13
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.170
The first is the Tao of Seneca by Seneca.

14
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.640
If you want to hear my favorite letters of all time touches on stoic philosophy,

15
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.130
calmness under duress, et cetera.

16
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.300
The next is the graveyard book by Neil Gaiman,

17
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.480
G a I M a N one of my favorites,

18
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.610
even if you're a nonfiction purist,

19
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.340
this is the fiction book that you need to listen to.

20
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.200
Neo also has perhaps the most calming voice of all time and third,

21
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.530
Greg McKeown's essential ism subtitle.

22
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.390
The disciplined pursuit of less.

23
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.500
This is one of my favorite books of the past few years combines very well with

24
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:31.040
the 80 20 principle, but more on audible every month.

25
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.830
Audible members get one credit for any audio book on the site,

26
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.210
plus a choice of multiple audible originals from a rotating selection.

27
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:41.870
They also get access to daily news digests from the likes of the New York times

28
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:45.410
wall street journal and the Washington post as well as guided meditation

29
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:48.800
programs. And here are some other amazing audible features.

30
00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:52.580
And I use a bunch of these. You can download titles and listen offline anytime,

31
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.280
anywhere I use this feature,

32
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.660
even when I could get access, I'll put my phone on say airplane mode,

33
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.760
because I don't want to get bothered with notifications.

34
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.930
And I'm taking a walk to clear my head and you can listen to titles offline in a

35
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:07.760
case like that or on a plane or whatever.

36
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.290
Obviously I'm not flying much these days.

37
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.760
The app is free and can be installed on all smartphones and tablets.

38
00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:16.520
You can listen across devices without losing your spot.

39
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.690
And whisper sync is another feature I use quite a lot.

40
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.820
I love reading my Kindle in bed. For instance,

41
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.810
then picking up at the same exact spot where I left off.

42
00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:28.520
When I go walking and listening to the next day,

43
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.720
Kindle and audio versions can be sinked up automatically is just amazing.

44
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.750
And if you can't decide what to listen to, don't sweat it.

45
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:36.584
You don't have to rush.

46
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.130

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.720
Hello, boys and girls, ladies and germs. This is Tim Ferriss.

62
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.730
Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show,

63
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.270
where it is usually my job to sit down with world-class performers of all

64
00:03:42.271 --> 00:03:46.320
different types, startup founders, investors, chess champions, Olympic athletes,

65
00:03:46.321 --> 00:03:49.860
you name it to tease out that habits that you can apply in your own lives.

66
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.450
This episode, however,

67
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.040
is an experiment and part of a short form series that I'm doing simply

68
00:03:56.041 --> 00:04:00.660
called books. I've loved. I've invited some amazing past guests,

69
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.930
close friends and new faces to share their favorite books.

70
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.480
Describe their favorite books. The books that have influenced them,

71
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.850
changed them, transform them for the better.

72
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.830
And I hope you pick up one or two new mentors in the form of books from this new

73
00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:16.020
series and apply the lessons in your own life.

74
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.200
I had a lot of fun putting this together,

75
00:04:19.201 --> 00:04:23.820
inviting these people to participate and have learned so so much myself.

76
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.820
I hope that is also the case for you. Please enjoy.

77
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.590
<v 3>My name is Anna bottle.</v>

78
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.150
I'm a writer and the founder of an organization called the school of life

79
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.690
dedicated to emotional fulfillment. And self-understanding,

80
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.180
I want to talk about two books today.

81
00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:46.140
That mean a huge amount to me and that I always press into the hands of pretty

82
00:04:46.141 --> 00:04:47.520
much anyone that I meet.

83
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.870
The first book is called home is where we start from.

84
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.030
And it's a collection of essays by wonderful English psychoanalyst called Donald

85
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.960
Winnicott. And Winnicott is wise on so many fronts,

86
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.320
but two of his ideas stand out in particular.

87
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.750
The first of his ideas concerns what he calls the true and the false

88
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.490
self for Winnicott.

89
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.320
All babies are born with a capacity to express Winnicott's

90
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:21.390
true self. In other words, to express themselves fully. And without inhibition,

91
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.260
if they're sad, they're going to cry. If they're angry, they might try and bite.

92
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.270
If they're happy, they'll giggle.

93
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.980
But the point is a child at a very young age is almost

94
00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:33.420
definitely authentic.

95
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.380
It is putting forward its feelings as it experiences them.

96
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.390
It is unfiltered. Um, and this is what gives babies their charm,

97
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.910
but also makes them terrifying, quite difficult to,

98
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.830
to look after because they're just doing exactly what they need to do

99
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.490
when they need to do it. There's no process of editing.

100
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.610
And this is a process of engaging with what Donald,

101
00:05:56.611 --> 00:06:00.140
when it got famous child psychoanalyst called the true self.

102
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:05.180
Now Keefer Winnicott is the idea that if you're going to grow up and be a

103
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:08.990
balanced and healthy and authentic human being,

104
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.030
you will need to have been given the enormous privilege of expressing

105
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.550
your true self to those around you.

106
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.640
In the very earliest years that you were on the planet,

107
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.680
all of us need to have those moments when we can be totally authentic.

108
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.280
Even at the cost of giving other people a bit of a headache around us,

109
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.900
we need some of this true self,

110
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.540
but Winnicott also observed in his work with children,

111
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.710
that there is a danger that something else happens too soon.

112
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.410
And that is the birth of a false self.

113
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.630
Now the full self is created out of the expectations of everyone around the

114
00:06:44.631 --> 00:06:48.440
small child. And there are all sorts of expectations. Firstly,

115
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.400
that the child will be good, that the child will go to sleep on time.

116
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:56.750
Which really means on the parents jejunal that the child will smile at Grammy,

117
00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.080
that the child will at school be polite to the teacher.

118
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.030
And then going on into later childhood will always follow certain

119
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:09.710
rules writing. Thank you letters, um, being a good child. Now,

120
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.920
there are obviously good aspects to being a good child,

121
00:07:12.921 --> 00:07:17.690
but Winnicott was very alive to the concept of over early

122
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.890
adaptation. What he called over compliance and for Winnicott,

123
00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:25.250
the over compliant child has all sorts of problems.

124
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.720
What happens is that they are more attuned to the demands of others than to

125
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:30.830
their own needs.

126
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.330
And this can give them lots of difficulties in later life when they can no

127
00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:37.310
longer be authentic. Um,

128
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.850
they lose touch with what they really want because what they really want has

129
00:07:40.851 --> 00:07:43.610
been censored so heavily by those,

130
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:48.140
around them in our world now is we know all about rebels and the problem with

131
00:07:48.141 --> 00:07:48.741
rebels. You know,

132
00:07:48.741 --> 00:07:51.650
they're the ones who graffiti the underpass and cause social problems.

133
00:07:51.651 --> 00:07:55.400
And we know how difficult this can be, but through the eyes of Winnicott,

134
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.140
we can also start to see another problem.

135
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.330
And in a way it's perhaps a bigger problem though.

136
00:07:59.331 --> 00:08:00.890
It doesn't present itself as such.

137
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.140
And that is an excess of compliance in a whole group of people that we can

138
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:10.070
call with nothing pejorative being meant by this, the good boys and girls,

139
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.900
there are good boys and girls everywhere.

140
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:15.860
And the problem with good boys and girls is they've been good too early.

141
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.350
They haven't got the bad out of their system.

142
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:22.760
They haven't had a chance to express themselves as they needed to in the early

143
00:08:22.761 --> 00:08:23.240
years,

144
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.720
they weren't able to bite when they wanted to bite to kick when they wanted to

145
00:08:26.721 --> 00:08:30.290
kick to scream and they wanted to scream all the things that little babies and

146
00:08:30.291 --> 00:08:33.710
infants do. And shouldn't frighten anyone by wanting to do,

147
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:37.220
if all of that is suppressed with too much energy, there will be a problem.

148
00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.870
So Winnicott the great patron Saint of being able to get the right

149
00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.980
relative claims of the true and the false self, a false self,

150
00:08:45.981 --> 00:08:48.170
we all need one to navigate adult life,

151
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:53.330
but it only starts to make internal sense if we've also had a chance to express

152
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.650
the true self at another point.

153
00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.540
Another great idea from Winnicott is the concept of the good enough parent.

154
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.610
Many parents came to Winnicott,

155
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.420
very worried that they weren't doing a good enough job as parents.

156
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.780
They wanted to be better. They were worried that they weren't educating the kid,

157
00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:13.590
right, or that there was some eating problem or school problem, et cetera.

158
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.790
And when it got could see that these worries were actually getting in the way of

159
00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:21.720
the parents doing, um, that you know, the fairly good job that they were doing.

160
00:09:21.721 --> 00:09:24.090
And so when it got made a fascinating intervention, first of all,

161
00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:28.140
he told parents, no child needs a perfect parent. Indeed.

162
00:09:28.141 --> 00:09:30.060
A perfect parent is very dangerous.

163
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:35.040
It's a one-way route to psychosis to a psychotic incident because essentially

164
00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:39.660
the job of a parent is to disappoint a child bit by bit and

165
00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:43.560
induct them into adult realities. If the parent is perfect,

166
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:48.090
how can the child grew used to living in the world that we all have to live in,

167
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.030
which is a deeply imperfect one. So in an ideal world,

168
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.740
a good parent is able to break bad news well to the child

169
00:09:56.010 --> 00:10:00.510
until the child can accept the whole panoply of difficulties of adult life

170
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.840
amounting, ultimately into the fact that we are all mortal,

171
00:10:03.841 --> 00:10:07.170
we are all going to have to die. So, um, Winnicott,

172
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.990
in order to capture what he was trying to tell parents came up with a wonderful

173
00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:12.450
phrase. He said, no one needs a perfect parent.

174
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.990
All they need is a good enough parent. And this phrase,

175
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.740
good enough is the one that Winnicott launched into the world.

176
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:24.000
And it's a highly useful one because in so many areas we don't need to be

177
00:10:24.001 --> 00:10:27.990
perfect. We just need to be good enough. We only need to be good enough workers,

178
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.610
good enough friends, good enough colleagues. Um, and as I say, good enough, uh,

179
00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.880
parents, all of this comes from the very down to earth,

180
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:40.620
beautifully written and always highly useful and humane wisdom of

181
00:10:40.621 --> 00:10:45.180
Donald Winnicott and his wonderful book home is where we start from

182
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.630
another book. That's very dear to me is by Arthur Schopenhauer.

183
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.840
And it's called essays on the wisdom of life. Now,

184
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:56.760
Arthur Schopenhauer is perhaps the most pessimistic of all the panoply

185
00:10:56.761 --> 00:10:58.080
of very pessimistic,

186
00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:02.670
German thinkers that philosophy produced in that country.

187
00:11:02.671 --> 00:11:03.780
In the 19th century,

188
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:08.640
he stands out for the unrelentingly miserable tone of his voice.

189
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.250
He says, at one point it is bad today.

190
00:11:11.251 --> 00:11:14.850
Tomorrow it will be worse until the worst of all happens.

191
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.560
He says at another point that human life is completely ill adapted to its

192
00:11:19.561 --> 00:11:24.210
purposes that no one can expect to be happy ever for more than five minutes at a

193
00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:25.260
time. Um,

194
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.850
and that anyone who expects anything out of romantic love is sure to be

195
00:11:29.851 --> 00:11:32.820
completely disappointed that nothing is true,

196
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.430
that no friends can be constant, um,

197
00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.850
that no career ambition will ever come. Right. I mean,

198
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.390
he is the most miserable person on a however,

199
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.570
reading him is a joy. Firstly, he writes beautifully.

200
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.950
He writes beautifully in German.

201
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.170
There's some wonderful translations into English.

202
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.890
And there's something about somebody articulating the most despairing thoughts

203
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.910
that brings us a huge amount of comfort for a start. We think I'm not alone.

204
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.760
All those suspicions. You have often, you know,

205
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:04.240
three in the morning and despair or, uh, gazing out of the, um,

206
00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.580
airplane window and a low moment. And you just think,

207
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:10.600
what on earth is the point of all this? Well, Schopenhauer has been there.

208
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:14.980
He's investigated the territory of despair and he's put his flag all over it.

209
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.650
And it is wonderful what he manages to see.

210
00:12:17.651 --> 00:12:20.680
Most of us only glimpse despair out of the corner of our eye.

211
00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:25.110
And we can't bear it. Schopenhauer urges us to look despair in the face,

212
00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.150
make friends with it and also laugh defiantly at it.

213
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:33.100
He's he's all the time sort of grinning slightly as he tells us these dark

214
00:12:33.101 --> 00:12:33.934
dark truths.

215
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.530
So often sadness comes about because we clash into an

216
00:12:38.531 --> 00:12:40.720
expectation of what life should be like.

217
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.670
That is simply contrary to what reality can actually produce and

218
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.830
showing how gently and with real intelligence nudges us towards a

219
00:12:50.831 --> 00:12:54.310
slightly more pessimistic vision of the world. Yes.

220
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.470
Many of your dreams won't come true. Yes.

221
00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:00.820
Probably love won't work out for your probably large aspects of your career. Um,

222
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.150
won't come off. Uh, probably many people will disappoint you.

223
00:13:04.151 --> 00:13:08.440
The world will seem ugly and dumb. Schopenhauer is saying, I know,

224
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.550
I know I've been here, let's cry together rather than alone,

225
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.930
or rather than escaping into a sentimental bromide that,

226
00:13:15.931 --> 00:13:19.180
that shields us from the fundamental reality that we're engaged with.

227
00:13:19.181 --> 00:13:22.960
So this is your man at the moments of real despair.

228
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.480
He is the friend and darkness and oddly,

229
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:30.430
strangely he is immensely consoling. Um, so these are two books,

230
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.000
uh, by Winnicott home is where we come from and, uh,

231
00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:38.140
by Schopenhauer essays on the wisdom of life that bring immense cheer in very

232
00:13:38.141 --> 00:13:42.040
different ways to the always confusing business of being alive.

233
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.620
<v 0>Hey guys, this is Tim again, just a few more things before you take off.</v>

That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered it could include

241
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:14.910
gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird that I've somehow dug up in the,

242
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.010
the world of the esoteric as I do,

243
00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:22.170
it could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared

244
00:14:22.171 --> 00:14:25.650
with my close friends, for instance. And it's very short.

245
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:30.720
