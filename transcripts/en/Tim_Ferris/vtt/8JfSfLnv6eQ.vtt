00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:06.060
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.460
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

<v 1>Books.</v>

5
00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:28.940
I've loved on the Tim Ferriss show is exclusively brought to you by audible.

6
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.010
There couldn't be a better sponsor for this series.

7
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:35.000
My dear listeners and readers I've used audible for so many years,

8
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.890
as long as I can remember. I love it.

9
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.070
Audible has the largest selection of audio books on the planet.

10
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.580
I listen when I'm taking walks. I listen while I'm cooking.

11
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.180
I listen whenever I can. And if you're looking for a place to start,

12
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.730
I can recommend three of my favorites.

13
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.170
The first is the Tao of Seneca by Seneca.

14
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.640
If you want to hear my favorite letters of all time touches on stoic philosophy,

15
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.130
calmness under duress, et cetera.

16
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.300
The next is the graveyard book by Neil Gaiman,

17
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.480
G a I M a N one of my favorites,

18
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.610
even if you're a nonfiction purist,

19
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.340
this is the fiction book that you need to listen to.

20
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.200
Neo also has perhaps the most calming voice of all time and third,

21
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.530
Greg McKeown's essential ism subtitle.

22
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.390
The disciplined pursuit of less.

23
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.500
This is one of my favorite books of the past few years combines very well with

24
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:31.040
the 80 20 principle, but more on audible every month.

25
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.830
Audible members get one credit for any audio book on the site,

26
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.210
plus a choice of multiple audible originals from a rotating selection.

27
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:41.870
They also get access to daily news digests from the likes of the New York times

28
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:45.410
wall street journal and the Washington post as well as guided meditation

29
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:48.800
programs. And here are some other amazing audible features.

30
00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:52.580
And I use a bunch of these. You can download titles and listen offline anytime,

31
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.280
anywhere I use this feature,

32
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.660
even when I could get access, I'll put my phone on say airplane mode,

33
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.760
because I don't want to get bothered with notifications.

34
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.930
And I'm taking a walk to clear my head and you can listen to titles offline in a

35
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:07.760
case like that or on a plane or whatever.

36
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.290
Obviously I'm not flying much these days.

37
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.760
The app is free and can be installed on all smartphones and tablets.

38
00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:16.520
You can listen across devices without losing your spot.

39
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.690
And whisper sync is another feature I use quite a lot.

40
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.820
I love reading my Kindle in bed. For instance,

41
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.810
then picking up at the same exact spot where I left off.

42
00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:28.520
When I go walking and listening to the next day,

43
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.720
Kindle and audio versions can be synced up automatically is just amazing.

44
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.750
And if you can't decide what to listen to, don't sweat it.

45
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:36.584
You don't have to rush.

46
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.130
You can keep your credits for up to a year and use them for instance,

47
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:43.820
to binge on a whole series. If you like audible offers just about everything.

<v 2>Hello.</v>

62
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.720
<v 1>Boys and girls, ladies and germs. This is Tim Ferriss.</v>

63
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.730
Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show,

64
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.270
where it is usually my job to sit down with world-class performers of all

65
00:03:42.271 --> 00:03:46.320
different types, startup founders, investors, chess champions, Olympic athletes,

66
00:03:46.321 --> 00:03:49.860
you name it to tease out that habits that you can apply in your own lives.

67
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.450
This episode, however,

68
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.040
is an experiment and part of a short form series that I'm doing simply

69
00:03:56.041 --> 00:04:00.660
called books. I've loved. I've invited some amazing past guests,

70
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.930
close friends and new faces to share their favorite books.

71
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.480
Describe their favorite books. The books that have influenced them,

72
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.850
changed them, transform them for the better.

73
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.830
And I hope you pick up one or two new mentors in the form of books from this new

74
00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:16.020
series and apply the lessons in your own life.

75
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.200
I had a lot of fun putting this together,

76
00:04:19.201 --> 00:04:23.820
inviting these people to participate and have learned so so much myself.

77
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.850
I hope that is also the case for you. Please enjoy.

78
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.260
<v 2>[Inaudible]. This is Cal Fussman the host of big</v>

79
00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.880
questions podcast.

80
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.200
I say that with great pride and thanks because if it weren't for you,

81
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.330
I wouldn't have my podcast.

82
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.860
Not only did you have me as a guest on yours twice,

83
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.430
but then you kept on nudging me to start my own,

84
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.380
and then you helped me set it up and it's transformed my

85
00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.810
life so much gratitude, brother.

86
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.910
I know you like to ask this question about books and the beauty of it is that

87
00:05:05.911 --> 00:05:09.210
you can get a different response from someone in 2019.

88
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.850
And when you asked him in 2016,

89
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.810
because they might've read a hundred or 150 new books during that time,

90
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.960
I do have to confess a weakness here.

91
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.420
I generally don't stop and wonder what book should I

92
00:05:24.421 --> 00:05:25.260
read next?

93
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.030
Nearly all of my reading revolves around who I'm going to interview next.

94
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.100
A lot of the people I've interviewed for big questions or Esquire magazine over

95
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:39.900
the last two decades have written books. So that's the bulk of my reading.

96
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.680
And this leads to my recommendation for your listeners.

97
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.430
Actually a couple of recommendations I'm going to make here.

98
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.650
I know you'll get behind these recommendations because these books were written

99
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.760
by somebody. I first heard on your podcast,

100
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.400
the tidying up guru, Marie condo.

101
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.290
I got a chance to interview Marie onstage at a recent event for Rakuten.

102
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.870
Maria is that company's ambassador of joy. And I've got to say,

103
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.040
I think she's one of the most unique people on the planet.

104
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.920
Certainly a master at what she does. In fact,

105
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.300
I walked away from the experience thinking she's a genius.

106
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.830
Tell you why in a second,

107
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.840
but first let me mention the books she's written first is called the

108
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:35.270
life changing magic of tidying up and subtitled the Japanese art

109
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.490
of decluttering and organizing.

110
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.270
She might've had an editor declutter that title a bit,

111
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:45.920
but a became a New York times bestseller and it sold 9 million

112
00:06:45.921 --> 00:06:46.754
copies.

113
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.650
The second book is called spark joy and illustrated

114
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:55.400
masterclass on the art of organizing and tidying up.

115
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.950
When we were up on stage,

116
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.640
I wanted to give the audience a taste of Murray's writing.

117
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.040
So I read from a section about storing socks.

118
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.690
It's on page 80 of her first book, the life-changing magic of tidying up.

119
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.170
And I've got to say, I've read Shakespeare.

120
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.510
Does soy have ski RBO Garcia Marquez, Mark Twain.

121
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.430
This section written by Marie is one of the most original

122
00:07:25.431 --> 00:07:27.230
thoughts I've encountered.

123
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.180
I never thought I'd see socks brought to life on a printed page,

124
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:35.390
but listen to how Marie looks at them.

125
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.790
So I'm going to pay JT we'll title here says storing

126
00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:41.624
socks,

127
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.800
treat your socks and stockings with respect.

128
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.450
And here goes,

129
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.740
have you ever had the experience where you thought what you were doing was a

130
00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:52.574
good thing,

131
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:57.890
but later learned that it had hurt someone at the time you were

132
00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.450
totally unconcerned oblivious to the other person's feelings.

133
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.760
This is somewhat similar to the way many of us treat our

134
00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:08.594
socks.

135
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:13.160
I visited the home of a client in her fifties as always.

136
00:08:13.161 --> 00:08:17.750
We started with her clothes. We moved through her wardrobe at a smooth pace,

137
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:23.090
finished the underwear and were ready to start organizing her

138
00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:26.930
socks. But when she pulled open her sock drawer,

139
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.830
I could not suppress a gasp.

140
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.590
It was full of potato,

141
00:08:33.591 --> 00:08:38.480
like lumps that rolled about she had folded back the tops

142
00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:42.740
to form balls and tied her stockings tightly in the middle.

143
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.800
I was speechless dressed in a crisp white apron.

144
00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:53.330
My clients smiled at me and said, it's easy to pick out what I need this way.

145
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:58.230
And it's quite simple. Put them away as well. Don't you think?

146
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.670
Although I frequently run into this attitude during my lessons.

147
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.670
It never fails to astonish me.

148
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.830
Let me state here in now. Never,

149
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.550
ever tie up your stockings, never,

150
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.850
ever ball up your socks.

151
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.220
I pointed to the balled up socks. Look at them carefully.

152
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.430
This should be a time for them to rest.

153
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:31.680
Do you really think they can get any rest like that? That's right.

154
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:37.050
The socks and stockings stored in your drawer are essentially on holiday.

155
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:42.510
They take a brutal beating in their daily work trap between your foot

156
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.610
and your shoe in during pressure and friction to protect

157
00:09:47.611 --> 00:09:48.780
your precious feet.

158
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:54.480
The time they spend in your drawer is their only chance to rest.

159
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.860
But if they are folded over balled up or tied,

160
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.560
they're always in a state of tension.

161
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.730
They're fabric stretched in their elastic, polled.

162
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.510
They roll bump into each other.

163
00:10:08.511 --> 00:10:12.050
Every time the drawer is open and closed.

164
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:14.390
Any socks and stockings,

165
00:10:14.391 --> 00:10:19.190
unfortunate enough to get pushed to the back of the drawer are

166
00:10:19.191 --> 00:10:23.900
often forgotten for so long that they're elastic stretches

167
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.120
beyond recovery.

168
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.770
When the owner finally discovers them and puts them on,

169
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.960
it will be too late and they will be relegated to the garbage.

170
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:40.910
What treatment could be worse than this?

171
00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.530
Well, Tim,

172
00:10:42.531 --> 00:10:46.870
all I can say saying is I'd never balled up a pair of socks since,

173
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:52.370
and Marie showed me how to fold a pair of socks on stage.

174
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.230
Anybody who wants to know how to fold a pair of socks can turn to page

175
00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.040
99 of her second book, spark joy.

176
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.470
There is a full page.

177
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.520
[inaudible] devoted to sock management.

178
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.800
These two books.

179
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:13.880
And my talk with Marie onstage have really changed the way I think they've

180
00:11:13.881 --> 00:11:17.630
liberated me to see the things that I own in a different way.

181
00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:22.610
If they're not completely useful or they don't spark joy,

182
00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.030
Murray recommends offering things to them.

183
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.090
And then it's Tara.

184
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.350
When she goes into somebody's home to tidy up, she has a system,

185
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.530
she starts with clothes, spurts, then papers and books.

186
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:38.900
Then sentimental items.

187
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.470
She's found it easiest to make decisions on clothes,

188
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.390
sentimental items come last because they're the hardest apart with

189
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.830
now. I got to admit him. I needed Murray very badly.

190
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.070
I've had a lot experiences in.

191
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.840
<v 3>My life and quite often I've kept physical objects from these</v>

192
00:11:58.841 --> 00:11:59.830
experiences.

193
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.750
<v 2>As mementos. I'm beginning to worry that I might.</v>

194
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.060
<v 3>Need five houses to store them all.</v>

195
00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.850
<v 2>I needed a way to pair down the Motherlode. So what I did.</v>

196
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.930
<v 3>Did was bring a few sentimental items on stage with made to see if Marie could</v>

197
00:12:15.931 --> 00:12:16.764
tell me.

198
00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.200
<v 2>If I should keep them or get rid of them.</v>

199
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.720
I hope what transpired will compel people to buy those two

200
00:12:24.721 --> 00:12:29.040
books? The first item was very unique, never seen another,

201
00:12:29.041 --> 00:12:33.480
like it it's a small garbage can made out of wine.

202
00:12:33.481 --> 00:12:37.440
Corks. The corks are glued together in a circle.

203
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.230
And at the bottom, the bill,

204
00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:44.490
the bin is held up by a base of Magnum

205
00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:49.470
champagne corks. I laughed first time I saw it.

206
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:50.940
It was in the office of.

207
00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.400
<v 3>The best sommelier in America at the time.</v>

208
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.170
<v 2>Andrea Immer. Now she's Andrea Emma Robinson.</v>

209
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:00.930
<v 3>His office was at windows on the world.</v>

210
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.370
That's the top of the world trade center.

211
00:13:02.371 --> 00:13:07.350
This was back in 2000 and I didn't know much about wine back then. And Andrew.

212
00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:11.580
<v 2>Yeah. Was helping to teach me how to be a summer. Yay.</v>

213
00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:15.780
For story. I was writing for Esquire magazine. In fact,

214
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.430
for one night in 2001, I did become.

215
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.560
<v 3>The Somalia at windows on the world.</v>

216
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:28.500
<v 2>Just before the hijack planes came in and took down the towers on nine</v>

217
00:13:28.501 --> 00:13:33.210
one one, which is one of the reasons that this garbage can is still with me.

218
00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.880
See what happened is that Andrea was.

219
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.060
<v 3>[Inaudible] for a more advanced position in cleaning out her office.</v>

220
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.330
She didn't know what to do with this garbage can made a wine corks.

221
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.100
I think somebody had given it to her.

222
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.660
<v 2>Her, and probably they didn't know what to do with it either.</v>

223
00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.130
I couldn't.

224
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:53.090
<v 3>Imagine what anybody would do with a garbage can made a wine.</v>

225
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.830
<v 2>Quirks. I even remember making fun of it.</v>

226
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.840
So as Andrea cleaned out her office, she passed.

227
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:04.290
<v 3>Based it onto a public relations person who was standing next to me when I met</v>

228
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:04.440
him.

229
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.140
<v 2>The fun of it about a year later is.</v>

230
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:12.390
<v 3>Relations person left her job for a better position and remembered</v>

231
00:14:12.391 --> 00:14:15.540
me making fun of the wine cork.

232
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.900
<v 2>Garbage can. So as a sort of gag,</v>

233
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:23.880
she passed it on to me. I didn't know what to do in it. So I put.

234
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.400
<v 3>It in my basement where I stored my wine.</v>

235
00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:27.990
<v 2>And I did find a use for it.</v>

236
00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:32.070
I began to toss inside this garbage can.

237
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:33.690
The quirks of the.

238
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.030
<v 3>Really good bottles that I enjoy.</v>

239
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:40.890
<v 2>That way I could save the corks and the memories inside these corks.</v>

240
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.600
I went on to do my night as Somalia at windows on the world.

241
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:50.070
It's one of the best nights of my life. And very soon afterward,

242
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.960
the were taken down, uh, nine one one.

243
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:59.120
Now this full story takes a while to tell. And if anybody wants to read it,

244
00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:03.830
they can Google cocktails before the collapse on esquire.com.

245
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:08.780
Bottom line here is I was so shaken by the entire experience,

246
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.950
took me 10 years to write that story. Anyway,

247
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:15.470
this garbage can made of wine.

248
00:15:15.471 --> 00:15:20.360
Corks was the only physical thing left

249
00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:24.170
that I had from windows on the world. I couldn't get rid of it.

250
00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.350
I moved across the country and over the years,

251
00:15:27.351 --> 00:15:30.350
some of the champagne cork legs began to fall off,

252
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.970
but I just couldn't bear to throw out this garbage can

253
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:36.890
into a garbage can.

254
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:42.500
Now having read Marie's books, I knew her emo,

255
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.470
if it sparks joy. Yeah. Keep it.

256
00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:50.300
If it makes your insides go continue. Yeah, keep it.

257
00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:52.910
But this garbage can made of wine.

258
00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:56.090
Corks contain many layers of emotions.

259
00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:01.340
It was filled with the corks of some of the great tastes of my life and some

260
00:16:01.341 --> 00:16:03.710
incredibly happy moments that came with them.

261
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:09.380
But it was also filled with a profound sadness that to

262
00:16:09.381 --> 00:16:11.240
this day has no depths

263
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:17.330
and no idea how Marie would react to all this. And I told her the story,

264
00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:20.270
there was a gas from the audience, a hush,

265
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:22.490
and then a prolonged silence.

266
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:26.390
Nobody knew how Marie would respond.

267
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:31.820
She took the garbage can of cork in her hands.

268
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:33.020
And I'm telling you, Tim,

269
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:37.250
it was almost like watching a Shumon reach into the

270
00:16:37.251 --> 00:16:40.580
spiritual being of this garbage can.

271
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.860
<v 3>In a wine corks.</v>

272
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:46.570
She closed her eyes as if she were using all of her powers.

273
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.460
<v 2>So pull out the essence of my experience.</v>

274
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:57.400
And then she turned to me and said,

275
00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:02.290
keep it, Tim.

276
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.380
<v 3>I'm telling you when she handed it back to me,</v>

277
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.810
I wanted to hug it like a baby.

278
00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.070
I never thought I'd ever love a garbage can like a child.

279
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.630
<v 2>Which goes to prove this is not about things.</v>

280
00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.480
This is about spirit.

281
00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:23.290
So I was very excited to show her the second item.

282
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.390
It was a photo of me boxing with Julio, Cesar Chavez. When he was a junior.

283
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.360
<v 3>The weight champion of the world at the time, yet.</v>

284
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:35.950
<v 2>Seven wins, no losses. I think it was four 84 knockouts or so.</v>

285
00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.660
And in this photo, I'm landing a left hook on his jaw.

286
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.890
Photos framed about two feet wide by 18 inches,

287
00:17:44.891 --> 00:17:49.860
tall captures one of the best moments of my life. In fact.

288
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.050
<v 3>It's a wonder, I still have my life.</v>

289
00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.680
<v 2>After I got in the ring with him. Thankfully,</v>

290
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:59.180
Julio had a sense of humor about the session. We did it for a magazine story.

291
00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.380
I definitely told that story on your podcast so people can hear it.

292
00:18:03.381 --> 00:18:05.150
There here's thing,

293
00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.740
anybody sitting in the audience in front of Maria and I had to know I,

294
00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:14.630
how I felt about this photo put Jane. Ah,

295
00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:19.850
but there was a catch. Does it bring you joy? Marie asked,

296
00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.220
Whoa. Yes. I said.

297
00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.250
<v 3>So much joy that, you know what I did.</v>

298
00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:30.620
I had the same photo blown up to the size of an entire

299
00:18:30.621 --> 00:18:33.110
wall from my office. So that.

300
00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:35.420
<v 2>Every day I go to, right,</v>

301
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:40.130
I can see myself in the ring with one of the greatest fighters who ever lived.

302
00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:44.510
And not only that, but actually landing a punch.

303
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:49.310
It's a daily reminder to me that whatever I can dream

304
00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.450
I can do. So Maria, I tell her,

305
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.130
here's the problem.

306
00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:00.740
I have this same photo filling up an entire wall in my office.

307
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:04.580
What should I do with this smaller one though?

308
00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:08.420
An outside observer looking at it now might see it as pretty large.

309
00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:13.790
Or he took the photo in her lap and slowly circled the hand over it.

310
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:14.780
I'm telling you Tim.

311
00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:19.880
It was like she was burrowing into the depths of the six months.

312
00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:22.970
I trained to get into the ring with Julio,

313
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.640
every punch I took in training.

314
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.850
<v 3>Russet up every time a medicine ball got hit.</v>

315
00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:32.480
<v 2>Slammed into my gut. She turned to me,</v>

316
00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.820
keep it. She said, no.

317
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.070
I was beginning to get a little nervous, Tim, because.

318
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.790
<v 3>If she was as attached to my sentimental items, as I was,</v>

319
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:47.600
if she was that attached to those items, I was in big trouble.

320
00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.500
<v 2>I'm telling ya, Tim, I just moved.</v>

321
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:54.200
And my wife looked at the boxes,

322
00:19:54.201 --> 00:19:57.800
filled with mementos that were filling up the new place.

323
00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:00.890
And she just flat out, asked me,

324
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:06.560
what is this a home or the Cal Fussman museum?

325
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.790
Well, I definitely need to get rid of some stuff.

326
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:14.300
So I pulled out my next item for Marie.

327
00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:18.050
I knew this would go directly to her heart.

328
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.000
It was a beautiful fan from our Homeland,

329
00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.900
Japan, her face lit up when she saw it,

330
00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.650
there were a lot of Japanese people in the audience.

331
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:35.780
Rakuten is a Japanese electronic commerce company founded by

332
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.560
Mickey Mikitani. The audience wanted to know the story.

333
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:44.840
The handle on this fan gave way to an oval that looked like

334
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.980
parchment.

335
00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:50.710
And on this parchment illustrations of a festival in Kishi water,

336
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:55.330
it's called [inaudible] every October, half a million.

337
00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.170
<v 3>People fill the streets to watch this festival.</v>

338
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:03.270
It's a wild parade of wooden floats the size of

339
00:21:03.271 --> 00:21:05.130
old fashioned stagecoaches.

340
00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:08.310
<v 2>That are ornately carved and decorated.</v>

341
00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.850
They have to have been built hundreds of years ago, right?

342
00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.700
<v 3>And there are long ropes in front of each coach.</v>

343
00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:19.680
I mean really long ropes, long enough to fit. 30, 40,

344
00:21:19.681 --> 00:21:22.140
50 young guys dressed in black,

345
00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:27.270
who line up to pull these floats through the streets. Ed blistering speeds.

346
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.290
While other guys are dancing on top of the floats.

347
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:36.930
<v 2>Waving these fans, then everyone eats crab and drinks beer. Well.</v>

348
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.330
<v 3>I always wanted to go to Kishi water.</v>

349
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.160
<v 2>And run.</v>

350
00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:45.090
What one of these teams I was told about this festival by a Japanese woman

351
00:21:45.091 --> 00:21:47.130
back in 1994,

352
00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:53.010
but my wife had just gotten pregnant and it was not the time for me to run off

353
00:21:53.011 --> 00:21:53.844
to this festival.

354
00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:58.680
So this Japanese woman gave me this fan as a way of saying,

355
00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:03.210
I hope one day you will get to the Don GT

356
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:07.800
until you do have this as a momentum.

357
00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.190
Well, it's been 25 years.

358
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.590
I never got to run in the dungeon,

359
00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.680
but I still have the fan.

360
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:22.530
Does it spark joy Murray asked, Oh yes. Makes me very happy.

361
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:27.660
She took it in her hands and lifted out the spirit.

362
00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:29.940
And she turned to me,

363
00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:35.910
give it as a gift to someone in the audience she said and make

364
00:22:35.911 --> 00:22:39.960
plans to go to the Bestival, the crowd applauded,

365
00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:41.243
and many people.

366
00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:44.100
<v 3>People in the audience approached me afterward and asked for the fan.</v>

367
00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.370
<v 2>I gave it to the first person who came up to me,</v>

368
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:51.720
a man who promised that he would never give it away.

369
00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:56.910
Now our friendship between that man and I may come out of that

370
00:22:56.911 --> 00:23:00.210
exchange, but something else occurred to me,

371
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:05.280
something I didn't mention to Marie that told me how

372
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:09.300
truly great her powers are. You see Tim,

373
00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.090
when I first brought this fan home,

374
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:16.230
I notice that my wife was not a big fan of that fan.

375
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:21.210
My wife's Brazilian. She was pregnant and hormonal.

376
00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.580
And now that I look back upon it,

377
00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.830
she certainly didn't like the fact that I was treasuring a gift I'd

378
00:23:28.831 --> 00:23:30.300
received from another woman.

379
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:35.820
I'm sure my wife was jealous of that fan from Keshee

380
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.073
WADA.

381
00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:41.370
So Marie had removed the jealousy from my home,

382
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.880
put me in the position to make a new friend and then nudged me to

383
00:23:46.881 --> 00:23:51.860
run in that festival where those experiences might take

384
00:23:51.861 --> 00:23:55.340
me to even greater places.

385
00:23:55.790 --> 00:24:00.410
And I will go to that festival and who knows where it will take me

386
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:05.690
now. I realize that not everyone is going to be able to track their clothes and

387
00:24:05.691 --> 00:24:10.100
sentimental items out from Marie condo and have her tidy up their

388
00:24:10.101 --> 00:24:11.750
lives. But you see,

389
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:16.340
that's why I'm recommending her books to your listeners.

390
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:22.100
I believe they will turn your listeners homes into

391
00:24:22.101 --> 00:24:26.030
sacred space tears.

392
00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:31.120
<v 0>Hey guys, this is Tim again, just a few more things before you take off.</v>

393
00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.060
Number one, this is five bullet Friday.

394
00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:37.390
Do you want to get a short email from me?

395
00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.560
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

396
00:24:41.561 --> 00:24:45.550
little more soul of fun for the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very short

397
00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:50.050
email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been pondering

398
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:50.913
over the week.

399
00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:54.400
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered it could include

400
00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:59.390
gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird that I've somehow dug up in the

401
00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.510
world of the esoteric as I do,

402
00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.670
it could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared

403
00:25:06.671 --> 00:25:10.150
with my close friends, for instance. And it's very short.

404
00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:15.220
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

405
00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.470
So if you want to receive that, check it out,

406
00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:22.420
just go to four-hour work week.com that's four hour work week.com all spelled

407
00:25:22.421 --> 00:25:25.570

408
