00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.540
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.850
<v 1>It seems like you.</v>

3
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.140
<v 0>Who have owned and use extremely well</v>

4
00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:17.090
vulnerability as a superpower of sorts on your show and quite possibly

5
00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:18.020
elsewhere in your life.

6
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.130
<v 1>Let's talk about one question.</v>

7
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.880
<v 0>Opponent of that, which is addiction. When did you first.</v>

8
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.100
<v 1>First think of yourself as having a problem with it?</v>

9
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.100
<v 0>Any type of substance abuse or substance use.</v>

10
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.860
<v 1>Uh, throughout my using, but I had a different point of view,</v>

11
00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:44.300
which is my heroes at that time were Bukovsky, uh,

12
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.850
they were other romantic drunks. They were Waylon Jennings. And I,

13
00:00:48.851 --> 00:00:51.470
and I had this, this fantasy,

14
00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:56.120
this romantic fantasy that I could do something artistically that would be

15
00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:59.570
impactful enough that it would excuse all of my shittiness, right?

16
00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:01.970
So like Wayland's got several songs,

17
00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:04.730
basically apologizing for cheating on his wife.

18
00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:09.080
And it's hard to be in love with a fun loving man and Bukovsky would put these

19
00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:12.620
books out and it kind of excuse what a horrendous piece of he was in his real

20
00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:17.360
life. So I think I very much was I was looking to be a up,

21
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.830
but, but maybe one that was funny enough that people overlooked it,

22
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.520
or I wrote something important enough that people would give me a pass.

23
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.950
And so that was kind of my, my fantasy. And on some level it worked a bit,

24
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.150
I think people were willing to be around me more than some other people that are

25
00:01:35.151 --> 00:01:35.751
less funny,

26
00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:40.520
but I had underestimated that I ultimately

27
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.630
suffered. I ultimately was, uh,

28
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.190
demoralized and pessimistic and,

29
00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:53.000
and defeated in that. It really wasn't about all the people around me.

30
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:57.860
I could keep in my orbit that I ultimately

31
00:01:57.861 --> 00:02:00.320
had to be with myself all the time. And,

32
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.970
and so I had an awareness that I drank too much. That was quite obvious.

33
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:09.710
And I knew that I used cocaine far more frequently than the surgeon

34
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:12.740
general would recommend. And I,

35
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.130
I didn't care until, you know,

36
00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:18.800
I had a few attempts at getting sober and I could put together two or three

37
00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:19.071
months.

38
00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:23.900
I generally did it because I knew I couldn't use the way I used and work in

39
00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:28.010
movies. And I cared more about that. So I would generally get sober from movies.

40
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.050
And then in between movies, I would, I would go out. Um, but I had, my,

41
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:36.410
my most profound moment was, uh, I was about to start this movies a thorough,

42
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.000
I knew I had to get sober for. I thought, Oh,

43
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:42.440
I'm going to go to Hawaii for a week vacation with a buddy before I start.

44
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.790
Cause I know I'm going to be getting sober.

45
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.190
And I specifically went to Hawaii because I,

46
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.520
I was under the impression they didn't have cocaine there.

47
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.230
It's very hard to get cocaine there and I, I didn't want to die,

48
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.100
but they have other stuff there. And I found crystal meth and all this stuff.

49
00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:58.310
And uh, by the time I, I left that trip,

50
00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:03.130
I had a layover San Francisco and I was so physically sick from that

51
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:07.510
week. I had been in a car accident. I had smoked meth for a few days.

52
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.550
I was just, I was in so much physical anguish that when I got to San Francisco,

53
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.650
I really needed to get down like three or four Jack and diets to make the flight

54
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:21.040
to LA. And I had been in AA at that point.

55
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:25.780
So I'm so afraid someone from AA is going to run

56
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:27.130
into me at this airport.

57
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.980
And so I'm hiding in the corner of this bar and there's the proverbial mirror

58
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.780
actually was there and I'm, I'm,

59
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:38.680
I'm hiding and I am people recognized me.

60
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.560
So that dream had come true. Um,

61
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.920
I was about to make the most amount of money I ever made in my life,

62
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:49.720
starting that movie and amount of money that I thought would solve all things.

63
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.340
And I was the most scared, most depressed,

64
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.200
most suicidal I had ever been with all the things I had wanted to get.

65
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.160
And that was a very, very scary moment. And I realized, wow,

66
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:05.170
it really isn't about those things.

67
00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:08.920
I had told myself as I think a lot of people do. Like if I got some money,

68
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:12.820
I'd be happy. If I got this girl, I'd be happy. If I got this job, I'd be happy.

69
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.350
And I was lucky enough to get to all those things. And I was very unhappy.

70
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.230
And so I really had to ask why,

71
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.240
and I had to actually figure out how to be happy. Cause it wasn't those things.

72
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.510
They help for sure. I don't want them to be taken away, but,

73
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.950
but I was at my point, uh, with all the things I had set out to get.

74
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.830
Where did you land.

75
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.910
<v 0>And asking those questions in terms of what makes you happy?</v>

76
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.600
What were the levers that mattered? What were the ingredients that mattered?

77
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.730
<v 1>Well, I've slowly cobbled together. A little checklist for me. I think,</v>

78
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.990
uh, a shame I just had a decade of shames, you know,

79
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.070
all kinds of deplorable behaviors while up.

80
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.920
Um, so that was a big component. And then really self-esteem right.

81
00:05:01.921 --> 00:05:06.330
I was trying to get my value from a lot of outside

82
00:05:06.331 --> 00:05:10.800
validation and then I got it and I just D I saw the same person in the mirror.

83
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.990
I'd also dated girls that I was convinced if that girl liked me. Well,

84
00:05:15.991 --> 00:05:19.470
clearly that would prove I was desirable and worthy of wanting.

85
00:05:19.471 --> 00:05:23.310
And then every time I'd look in the mirror, their house, I same piece of.

86
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.870
And so over years of being sober,

87
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.840
my lists really became, have I exercised?

88
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.720
I can't put too fine. A point on my belief in exercise. I like, uh, I'm a, uh,

89
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.640
a zealot about it. I I'm annoying. I, if I had to pick one thing in my life,

90
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:42.810
it would be that I exercise.

91
00:05:42.811 --> 00:05:47.160
I've just never felt worse after an hour of exercise than I felt before.

92
00:05:47.161 --> 00:05:51.690
So exercise is huge. Um, you know, have I gone to a meeting? That's huge.

93
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.380
Have I been of service to somebody I don't want to be. Uh,

94
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.680
and in general, when I feel terrible, if I asked myself those three things,

95
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.710
if those three things happened today, they've never happened.

96
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.460
I've never done those three things. And, and, and,

97
00:06:06.461 --> 00:06:10.130
and been in major discontent. I, you know,

98
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:12.080
that for me is kind of my checklist.
