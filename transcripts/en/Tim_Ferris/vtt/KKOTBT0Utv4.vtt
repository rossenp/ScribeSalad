00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.770
<v 0>Everybody. This is Tim Ferris.</v>

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.730
And I'm answering a question today that I get very often,

3
00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:10.440
which is what are you learning? What are you studying? And it is 2020.

4
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.420
And I am an amateur learning hand percussion

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.280
specifically with this instrument. And it looks like a UFO,

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.270
as you can see, and it is known by many different names.

7
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:28.590
Some people call it a hang, some people call it a hang drum.

8
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.520
There are religious Wars about this and other people call it a han.

9
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.730
<v 2>D pan. There are many different brands, many different makers.</v>

10
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.750
This particular instrument was made by Dave Berry,

11
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.130
B E R Y super-sweet guy in

12
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:48.750
California. And this is tuned to the Hijaz scale. And this instrument,

13
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:50.790
you can think of it as a simplified, of course,

14
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.820
as a steel drum that you might see in the Caribbean,

15
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.620
which has been turned into a casing with two sides.

16
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.990
<v 0>And this particular instrument is tuned with hammering and metal work.</v>

17
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.890
So you really don't want your instrument to get knocked out of tune unless you

18
00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:09.240
happen to be a really good metal worker.

19
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.700
And I'm going to demonstrate some basic features of the instrument.

20
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.080
I am not a good hand pan player or hand percussionist,

21
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.580
but I've been very fortunate to get a handful of very,

22
00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:25.650
very nice instruments. This is Dave berries.

23
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.940
This is another hand pan that I'll demo down here,

24
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.990
which is made by Jaan Boren. Hopefully I'm getting that name, right?

25
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.690
J a N B O R R E N and the Netherlands.

26
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.820
And I've had some fantastic instruction from someone I found

27
00:01:41.821 --> 00:01:45.960
on YouTube because he's amazing. David Cook cut a mountain. I'm sure.

28
00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:47.970
David I'm screwing up your name yet again,

29
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.800
but David K U C K E R H E R M

30
00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:57.150
a N N. And you can find him@handpandojo.com,

31
00:01:57.151 --> 00:02:01.440
where he offers all sorts of online courses and programs for learning this

32
00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:04.410
instrument. And if you want to see a highlight of him,

33
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.730
just search his name and prelude on YouTube. It's amazing.

34
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:13.590
He has 50,000 plus followers on YouTube for playing hand

35
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:16.560
percussion, which is a feat in and of itself. All right.

36
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.930
I love said let's get into this. So I'll just demo some basics once again,

37
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.450
to emphasize I'm not a good player, but I love playing this instrument.

38
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.300
And of course I say without further ado,

39
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:33.750
and then I keep on going with my preamble, but I've tried many,

40
00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:36.900
many musical instruments. When I was a kid. I tried piano and I quit.

41
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.350
I tried trumpet and I quit because in the beginning,

42
00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:44.820
it's very hard to sound good. I did gravitate towards five-piece drum kit,

43
00:02:44.821 --> 00:02:48.150
but only had a few lessons until I graduated from college.

44
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.960
At which point I was in a tiny apartment and could couldn't make it work. So.

45
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.440
<v 1>You hear there is a lot of reverberation and the sound</v>

46
00:02:57.441 --> 00:03:00.700
between these two instruments will be very, very different. Okay?

47
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.080
<v 0>So you've got a scale. This is tuned to Hejaz, which has a middle Eastern sound.</v>

48
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.800
<v 1>[Inaudible] producing sound out of this.</v>

49
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.940
<v 0>Just to David. If I get anything wrong, it's my fault. It's not your fault.</v>

50
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.640
David is a machine he's amazing.

51
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.340
And one of the best teachers of any skill I've ever met,

52
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.990
these are tone fields. And I'm making contact.

53
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:32.783
<v 1>With.</v>

54
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.360
<v 0>Index finger primarily around this portion of the tone fields,</v>

55
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.081
these tone fields.

56
00:03:40.081 --> 00:03:44.220
And I'm playing with my thumbs as I get closer to my body because otherwise I

57
00:03:44.221 --> 00:03:48.600
end up going chicken wing and it's ergonomically very uncomfortable, right?

58
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.750
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

59
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.710
<v 0>It's on slightly bent,</v>

60
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.470
not like that because that is how you make your hands ache,

61
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.323
which I did in the meeting.

62
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.660
<v 1>And this is the dang or the.</v>

63
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.910
<v 0>Doing there's many different words.</v>

64
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.250
<v 1>For it. It's like that with this.</v>

65
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.380
<v 0>Thicker part of my thumb or index finger on.</v>

66
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.350
<v 1>There and making contact with the Palm. Okay.</v>

67
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.020
<v 0>So let me just tool around on this for a second.</v>

68
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.870
And it'll give you an idea of what this thing is capable of.

69
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.090
And I'll try to produce a few different types of sounds.

70
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:19.643
<v 1>So</v>

71
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.080
these very light notes.

72
00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.050
<v 0>Ghost notes, drew really cool. David introduced me to those and, uh.</v>

73
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.290
<v 1>And then you can get some cool effects. You can use.</v>

74
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.410
<v 0>Hands like this, which you wouldn't want to hit on the Tony fields, but if.</v>

75
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.243
<v 1>You want it to do</v>

76
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.960
do that kind of thing, there's a tuck. Just that.

77
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.250
<v 0>So if we were to use, and these are my notes from some of what I did with David,</v>

78
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.840
if we're using a rhythm known as the,

79
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.640
I believe it's Holly, G K H a L I G I,

80
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.480
I unfortunately do not speak Arabic, but there are a lot of amazing,

81
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.770
amazing rhythms and techniques that come out of Middle-Eastern music.

82
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.160
It would look something like the following and there are different ways to play

83
00:05:44.161 --> 00:05:44.994
it. So.

84
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.520
<v 1>So notice I'm doing one to,</v>

85
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.630
so the right hand is having two points of contact.

86
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.180
Now you can produce the same sound using.

87
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.380
<v 0>Alternating hands and just the left-hand. So if you look at this.</v>

88
00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.220
<v 1>No, I just switched the left hand.</v>

89
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.350
So those are three different hands.

90
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.920
<v 0>The techniques for producing the same rhythm on the same surface,</v>

91
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.450
and which you use would depend on what you're using and how you're using the

92
00:06:46.451 --> 00:06:51.430
rest of this surface. It's super exciting. It's so fun. Uh, and,

93
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.400
uh, you can use multiple fingers on multiple tone fields.

94
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.490
So if I want it to do something, let's just say like,

95
00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.350
and I'll move over to this other hand pan in a minute.

96
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:00.783
<v 1>But</v>

97
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.990
I'm using these two fingers together,

98
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.820
right? David.

99
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.160
<v 0>Does all this thousand times better. So go watch his videos,</v>

100
00:07:24.161 --> 00:07:27.710
but this will show you how much a novice who really doesn't know what he's doing

101
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:30.550
and can have fun with this instrument and playing just 10,

102
00:07:30.551 --> 00:07:34.590
15 minutes in the morning or at night is just pure bliss and meditation.

103
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.320
<v 1>Okay. All right. So this is.</v>

104
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:43.540
<v 0>That surface. Dave does really, something really fun with his instrument,</v>

105
00:07:43.541 --> 00:07:44.440
this particular instrument,

106
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:49.090
where you can see the surfaces very different on this side.

107
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.910
And if you were say doing a performance on a hand pan after 60

108
00:07:54.911 --> 00:07:59.200
minutes of one scale, you might get tired of doing what you're doing.

109
00:07:59.201 --> 00:08:01.600
People might get a little fatigued of listening to it. So then.

110
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.893
<v 1>So you can.</v>

111
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.710
<v 0>Play with all sorts of stuff. I'm less practiced on this side, but.</v>

112
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:14.380
<v 1>Can.</v>

113
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.930
<v 0>Certainly throw some novelty in there. So that is,</v>

114
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.100
that is hand pan one from Dave, uh, which I really enjoy.

115
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.040
<v 1>Playing. And.</v>

116
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:29.350
<v 0>This is a very, very different hand pan from the Netherlands. And you can see.</v>

117
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.160
<v 1>It looks a bit like.</v>

118
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:40.120
<v 0>And pan that took at least one or two hits of acid is asymmetrical.</v>

119
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.850
And the tune fields are Nolan.

120
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:45.723
<v 1>Uh.</v>

121
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.360
<v 0>DentiCal oval. So it's distributed differently.</v>

122
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.370
And another difference that you'll find,

123
00:08:51.371 --> 00:08:55.590
and I'm not adept enough to take advantage of this is there are tone fields on

124
00:08:55.591 --> 00:09:00.090
the bottom so that you could hypothetically be playing on this side

125
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.313
and still

126
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:12.020
Advantage of this under the rim,

127
00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.250
which is really cool.

128
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:17.420
David's exceptional at doing this and the way I'm already orienting.

129
00:09:17.421 --> 00:09:20.000
This is generally speaking.

130
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.260
And those of you who are paying attention may notice this has more tone fields,

131
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.940
more notes, and I'm orienting this so that

132
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:31.363
the deepest

133
00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:35.570
Towards my navel effectively,

134
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:40.550
and that's going to split this right down the middle so that I have my left and

135
00:09:40.551 --> 00:09:44.660
right hands working on 50% of this instrument, right? And so

136
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.270
A different look and feel, and you can find some of these interested,

137
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.580
some of these instruments are tuned with minor key,

138
00:09:55.581 --> 00:09:59.840
so it can have a melancholic sort of point in sound to it.

139
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.590
And others are very upbeat and it's hard to go wrong.

140
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:06.620
When you have an instrument like this tuned in a particular way,

141
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.200
you can kind of whack on it almost any way you want,

142
00:10:09.201 --> 00:10:12.620
and it's gonna sound pretty good. Uh, so one.

143
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.780
<v 1>Three, four, five, six.</v>

144
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.060
<v 0>You can do, you can do scales. So you can do seven notes, eight notes,</v>

145
00:10:23.061 --> 00:10:24.110
nine notes, something like.

146
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:30.373
<v 1>Oops</v>

147
00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:39.080
[inaudible].

148
00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.350
<v 0>And that could be a practice for you like seven, eight, nine, seven, eight,</v>

149
00:10:42.351 --> 00:10:44.810
nine, or seven, seven, eight, eight, nine, nine.

150
00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.100
And then there is a technique. So we talked about.

151
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:51.733
<v 1>Right.</v>

152
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:55.530
<v 0>Uh, and, uh,</v>

153
00:10:55.530 --> 00:11:00.050
you could use that for any number of rhythmic combinations.

154
00:11:00.051 --> 00:11:01.860
So for example, you could do something like.

155
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.233
<v 1>Slowing it down.</v>

156
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.280
<v 0>And then if you wanted to throw toxin there, you could do that as well.</v>

157
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.203
So you can just.

158
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.433
<v 1>I'll say go higher up</v>

159
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.010
and that you can.

160
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.860
<v 0>Really experiment. So if you want to do something a little bit.</v>

161
00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:00.030
<v 1>Uh, involved, you could do.</v>

162
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.100
<v 0>You just riff and it's very, it's very playful.</v>

163
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:26.183
<v 1>You can also play it.</v>

164
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.600
<v 0>Sort of a, a, a drum on itself.</v>

165
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.993
<v 1>Wait.</v>

166
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.290
<v 0>What can be done? So those are some of the basics.</v>

167
00:12:55.291 --> 00:12:59.880
I'll show you one more type of hand contact and you can use all.

168
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.280
<v 1>Sorts of, right.</v>

169
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:04.350
<v 0>David's quite good at using his knuckles.</v>

170
00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:10.320
<v 1>Uh, but you can do a slap as well. So I'll set up</v>

171
00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:16.470
again, get the lowest note in front of me.

172
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.950
<v 0>So you can do something like, uh, so the slap I'm going to do.</v>

173
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.290
<v 1>And you can do it as you are.</v>

174
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.410
<v 0>You're sort of pushing into the instruments, not a.</v>

175
00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.810
<v 1>Quick release. You see that</v>

176
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:33.953
you might do something like.

177
00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.710
<v 0>So there you have it folks. Uh,</v>

178
00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.370
this is one of my favorite instruments.

179
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.590
It is a really fun instrument to play.

180
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:09.150
It is unfortunately because of the worksmanship that has to go into these.

181
00:14:09.151 --> 00:14:13.830
It is an expensive instrument purchase, but they're beautiful.

182
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.810
And it's allowed me an entry way into

183
00:14:18.811 --> 00:14:23.070
music and becoming fascinated with music in a way that I haven't known before,

184
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.790
because it's difficult to take a five-piece drum kit and put it in your house

185
00:14:26.791 --> 00:14:31.140
for a lot of people. It is difficult to travel with five-piece drum kit,

186
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:36.240
but when you have something like this or many other types

187
00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.900
of frame drum, our other hand drums,

188
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.440
it opens up an entire universe of possibilities.

189
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.440
And another aspect of that, that is really beautiful.

190
00:14:46.441 --> 00:14:50.280
This hand roaming has existed in every civilization, uh,

191
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:54.920
past I'm sure in the future and across the world. So it is a common language.

192
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.270
Anyway,

193
00:14:56.270 --> 00:15:01.160
there you have a brief introduction to my love of this instrument,

194
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:05.300
my apologies for any mistakes that I may have made, uh, if I misspoke,

195
00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:10.250
if I offended anyone's delicate sense abilities, my apologies, uh,

196
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:14.930
but, uh, thank you to Dave Barry, to David,

197
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:19.730
uh, [inaudible] cook Hudman, uh, who is just remarkable,

198
00:15:19.731 --> 00:15:22.820
and the many people out there who are producing these instruments and producing

199
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:24.320
beautiful music. Thanks guys.
