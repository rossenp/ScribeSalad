00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.280
<v 0>Hello, boys and girls. This is Tim Ferriss.</v>

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.650
And welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show.

3
00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:07.680
This is going to be a sponsor free,

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.320
somewhat unusual episode.

5
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.650
And I implore you to please listen to the whole thing.

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.020
I have been in quarantine slash self isolation with my girlfriend and Molly,

7
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:22.770
my pup for about four weeks now. And I've been tracking all of this very,

8
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:24.630
very closely since the beginning.

9
00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:29.400
I've also been in close contact with people working in emergency

10
00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:32.490
rooms, ICU, et cetera, in New York,

11
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:35.940
as well as prior to that Italy and other places.

12
00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:37.920
So I've had an ear to the ground for some time.

13
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.810
I expect next week is currently Friday, March 20th,

14
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.400
to be an exceptionally difficult week for many people in many cities,

15
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.950
New York city, chief among them.

16
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.110
And if you are lucky enough to be listening to this podcast and healthy,

17
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.440
you likely owe something to a healthcare worker.

18
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.880
If it weren't for healthcare workers, I would be dead. As one example,

19
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.200
if not for healthcare workers, my dad would have died of a heart attack.

20
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.320
At least three uncles, at least two aunts,

21
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.180
just off the top of my head would be dead or it not for healthcare workers and

22
00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:19.620
much like a seatbelt or an airbag. These are things in this case,

23
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:23.060
people who are of incredible importance

24
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.590
and you don't really notice them until you need them.

25
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.060
So I would encourage you to think of healthcare workers, alongside people,

26
00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:37.040
working on vaccine development and drug development as the walls of the city.

27
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.500
These are the people who are most important to protect right now.

28
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.480
If we want to recover quickly from the current SARS cov

29
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.930
two COVID-19 pandemic threat. If you want,

30
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.590
just in enlightened self-interest you want the markets to rebound.

31
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.340
You want your investments to rebound. You want life to go back to normal.

32
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.660
The first thing I would draw your attention to is ensuring that healthcare

33
00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:05.210
workers that's what we're going to focus on this episode,

34
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.440
have what they need to fight extremely effectively.

35
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.180
That is critically important because as soon as we have shortages of staff,

36
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.150
we have many, many more compounding problems.

37
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:21.920
So this episode is going to bounce around a bit and I'm

38
00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:24.140
going to highlight things that can be done.

39
00:02:24.141 --> 00:02:27.680
And I'm also going to highlight companies. I hope continue to do work.

40
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.050
And some that might be good options for people to explore as well as a number of

41
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:36.920
resources. And I'm going to read first,

42
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.600
just from some notes that I've taken over the last few weeks of speaking

43
00:02:41.601 --> 00:02:43.580
with very, very,

44
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.630
very credible physicians on the front lines,

45
00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:52.550
who are not only doing the work themselves with patients as clinicians,

46
00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:54.980
but who are also in management positions.

47
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.390
So in no particular order, here we go. Doctors, nurses,

48
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.070
PAs texts, doing x-rays technicians that is cleaning staff.

49
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.940
These are all people who are making incredible sacrifices for you.

50
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.710
Anyone listening to this every day.

51
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.810
And if you are one of these healthcare workers suffice to say,

52
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.600
I want to give you my sincerest. Thanks.

53
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.610
You are going to make the difference here.

54
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.590
You are one of the most important elements in this entire puzzle.

55
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:29.410
So thank you for doing what you do right now.

56
00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:31.840
Physicians feel very let down by the federal government.

57
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.070
They have a lack of PPE, personal protective equipment and so on.

58
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.880
They did sign up many of them to risk their lives and help others,

59
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:41.920
but they do need support.

60
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.720
So here are a few of the things that have come up repeatedly as very

61
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:50.620
important and very immediate. And by immediate,

62
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.250
I mean not to act like Nostradamus,

63
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:58.420
but I've very accurately predicted a lot of what would happen over the last four

64
00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:03.370
weeks. And next week, I anticipate to be a very difficult week in New York city.

65
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.380
And these people need help right now. Not next Tuesday,

66
00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:11.710
not next Thursday, but ASAP immediately.

67
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.250
The first is temporary housing,

68
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.480
temporary housing for healthcare workers slash providers.

69
00:04:19.481 --> 00:04:21.940
So they can rest instead of commute for instance,

70
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.930
and also not go home and risk infecting elderly parents.

71
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.450
And I am going to call a few people out here for thanks and

72
00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:36.310
also hopefully to jump into the fray to help

73
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.840
the first is Airbnb. So at Airbnb on Twitter,

74
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:45.520
I would like to thank for already having deployed

75
00:04:45.521 --> 00:04:48.760
experiments in Italy, helping with temporary housing.

76
00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:52.720
So Airbnb and I also want to say just in general, private enterprises,

77
00:04:52.721 --> 00:04:57.280
really stepping up many to try to help where the government is failing.

78
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.280
So Airbnb is already doing experiments and I really hope they

79
00:05:03.281 --> 00:05:07.270
continue to run experiments in the U S nowhere.

80
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.760
Is that more urgent than in New York city at the moment?

81
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.260
Next I'd like to bring up Hilton hotels at Hilton

82
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:14.920
hotels,

83
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.360
certainly not the only hotel chain or

84
00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:23.680
hospitality group that could help in these circumstances. For instance,

85
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.130
you have, and I'm going to get the name pronunciation wrong here,

86
00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:28.150
but Gary Neville,

87
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.200
famous soccer player and Chelsea chairman Roman

88
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.600
Abramovich in the UK are making their hotels available for healthcare workers.

89
00:05:37.601 --> 00:05:39.760
Right now, this is extremely valuable.

90
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.190
So Hilton is having a tough time as are many in hospitality. And, uh,

91
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.230
I have listened to quite a bit from bill Ackman at

92
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:52.870
bill Ackman, who is deeply involved with Hilton.

93
00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:57.350
And I think that there's tremendous opportunity right now to not only do lot of

94
00:05:57.351 --> 00:06:01.610
good, but also set Hilton and fill in the blank.

95
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:06.080
If you are involved with another hotel or hospitality group up for success

96
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.120
later, and I will commit right now to highlighting and promoting

97
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:12.770
anyone who steps up,

98
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.150
meaning larger companies who step up and even smaller.

99
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.870
If I find you on Twitter and I see you, but larger companies, especially I will,

100
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.180
I will promote and put my machine behind you.

101
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.410
If you step up now for New York city and other cities who need help. All right,

102
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:31.850
so that's Airbnb clap, clap, please expand what you're doing,

103
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:36.320
keep doing what you're doing and at Hilton hotels and by association,

104
00:06:36.321 --> 00:06:41.210
since I don't know anyone else to get directly to Hilton, that is bill Ackman,

105
00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:45.700
who I think has thought very clearly about a lot related to this

106
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.700
next up is food food. We need to keep people not just rested,

107
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.050
but also fed and food can be very difficult for people on

108
00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.040
grilling shifts in the ER, what I don't want.

109
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.300
And I had to think very carefully about the call to action here is for people to

110
00:07:04.301 --> 00:07:06.790
suddenly show up at ERs with hundreds of boxes of pizza.

111
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.350
I think that will create just as one example, more problems, more confusion,

112
00:07:11.351 --> 00:07:14.950
more contagion, uh, than any thing it would solve.

113
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.180
But, uh, there are a few options here.

114
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.650
So the first is there are a number of companies, uh,

115
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.300
for instance, uh,

116
00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:29.560
you have Sweetgreens who is delayed bring meals to healthcare workers at

117
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.430
sweet green. I believe it is singular. And then you have Uber eats.

118
00:07:33.431 --> 00:07:38.140
I think Uber eats is probably the operator who has the most

119
00:07:38.141 --> 00:07:42.880
leverage here to do the most good and Uber eats at Uber eats has

120
00:07:42.881 --> 00:07:47.410
already said, and this was a pinned tweet from March 16th,

121
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.210
we're committing 300,000 plus meals to healthcare workers and first responders.

122
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.730
So that is a huge deal.

123
00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:59.170
And if I try to find the instructions for how to take advantage of that as a

124
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.030
healthcare worker, I can't find it. So at Uber eats, please,

125
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:04.810
uh,

126
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:09.220
make it clearer on your Twitter account and elsewhere how people can actually

127
00:08:09.221 --> 00:08:13.390
take advantage of this. All I see is on the linked blog,

128
00:08:13.391 --> 00:08:17.860
post interested officials and organizations can reach us at,

129
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.000
and then the email,

130
00:08:19.001 --> 00:08:23.320
which is social hyphen impact hyphen support@uber.com. Again,

131
00:08:23.321 --> 00:08:26.650
that's social hyphen impact hyphen support@uber.com.

132
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.800
But this is very cumbersome. It is not expedient.

133
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:34.150
The instructions need to be very clear or the plans need to be very clear and

134
00:08:34.151 --> 00:08:35.050
the need is immediate.

135
00:08:35.051 --> 00:08:38.680
This isn't something that can be conveniently rolled out over 12 months.

136
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.290
If you really want to help now is the time to help.

137
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.470
So I appreciate you making the commitment and please make the instructions and

138
00:08:44.471 --> 00:08:48.280
announcements much, much clearer. And for people who are listening,

139
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.320
who are asking, how can I personally help?

140
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:57.060
I'm going to be creating a separate email of people who are

141
00:08:57.061 --> 00:09:01.470
interested in different types of helping. And I will let you know right now,

142
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.390
things are very messy and there are many ways to become confused and waste

143
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:10.230
resources. I will give you one option in a few minutes, but suffice to say,

144
00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:14.520
go to tim.blog Ford slash fight COVID that's tim.blog Ford slash fight

145
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.140
COVID and add your name and

146
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:19.710
email.

147
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:24.330
And I will do my best to share with you vetted

148
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.810
options for helping. All right.

149
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.890
Now I said, I was going to mention something where you might be able to help,

150
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:36.210
and that is coming up right now. So announcement today that came out.

151
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.880
This is from Ryan Peterson,

152
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:43.920
P E T E R S E N at types, fast on Twitter.

153
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.400
He is the CEO of Flexport and here's the announcement.

154
00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:53.010
Paul Graham at Paul G and then subtext for those who don't know

155
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:58.380
of Y Combinator fam just donated $1 billion to flexport.org.

156
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.190
That gift will pay for almost all of the protective gear required by the entire

157
00:10:02.191 --> 00:10:06.000
city of San Francisco's frontline healthcare workers will likely distribute the

158
00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:10.890
equipment to hospitals and other locations. All right, Flexport,

159
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.630
flexport.org is global logistics and sustainability.

160
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:20.460
And, uh, as we scroll down, I'm looking at Paul's response to that,

161
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.020
and I encourage everyone to follow Paul Graham on Twitter. Here's what he says,

162
00:10:25.021 --> 00:10:25.890
potential donors.

163
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.840
I've known Ryan for many years and know how extraordinarily effective he is.

164
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.320
So if the hospitals in your city lack protective equipment, ask Ryan,

165
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.410
and he'll go get it for you. Who is Paul Graham? If you don't know,

166
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.970
he was involved in helping get companies like Dropbox,

167
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.000
Airbnb, Reddit, et cetera, off the ground.

168
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.920
That's the very simplified version, but take that seriously.

169
00:10:49.921 --> 00:10:50.970
So do take a look.

170
00:10:50.971 --> 00:10:54.540
If you're interested in supporting personal protective equipment,

171
00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.320
one option may be flexport.org,

172
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:03.420
and you can take a look@thataswellasflexport.com forward slash.

173
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:04.343
<v 1>Donate.</v>

174
00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:10.140
<v 0>Next up we've covered temporary housing.</v>

175
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.060
We've covered food.

176
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:16.860
We've covered the personal protective equipment for now,

177
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.140
uh, at home testing,

178
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.940
which would minimize the number of people showing up at clinics

179
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.450
unannounced, asking for testing and causing further chaos.

180
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:31.560
I will keep everyone posted on findings that I come across,

181
00:11:31.561 --> 00:11:33.390
which are promising related to at-home testing.

182
00:11:33.391 --> 00:11:37.020
If you go again to Tim up log forward slash fight COVID I will also put that on

183
00:11:37.021 --> 00:11:40.020
social and I'll put it on Twitter.

184
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:42.270
My account is ti Ferris.

185
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.390
So twitter.com forward slash T F E R R I S S.

186
00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:50.220
The next few things I'm going to touch upon are what Amazon might be able to do

187
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.070
that would allow citizen philanthropists that is individuals and not large

188
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:55.570
companies to help.

189
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.710
And I will also talk about ventilators,

190
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:04.480
and this is new specifically for healthcare workers to increase the

191
00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:07.060
capacity of ventilators. And actually I'll speak to that first.

192
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.460
A lot of talk right now is about manufacturing ventilators,

193
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:15.790
because cities are likely not certain,

194
00:12:15.791 --> 00:12:20.530
but very likely to face in the United States and elsewhere

195
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:23.260
shortages of ventilators. We saw this in Italy and elsewhere,

196
00:12:23.261 --> 00:12:26.920
where physicians had to make the decision of who would live in,

197
00:12:26.921 --> 00:12:31.450
who would die and calculating the number of likely healthy years that someone

198
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:34.180
might have and choosing accordingly things of that type.

199
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.870
It would be best if our physicians don't have to make those choices.

200
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:42.580
This is not a 0.001% likelihood.

201
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.330
This is a, I'm not going to say probable,

202
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:50.800
but very possible problem that we will experience in the United States.

203
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.250
And while we are manufacturing ventilators,

204
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:59.080
there are techniques for modifying ventilators so that you can use a

205
00:12:59.081 --> 00:13:03.670
single ventilator, not on one person, but two or four.

206
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:08.320
And I've put up a blog post describing this.

207
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.220
This is all provided to me and vetted by people in the medical

208
00:13:12.221 --> 00:13:16.090
community@tim.blog Ford slash ventilator.

209
00:13:16.091 --> 00:13:20.350
So if you go to tim.blog Ford slash ventilator, that will show you,

210
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.450
and also talks about some of the complexities,

211
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:27.040
how to modify existing ventilators without new shipments of ventilators,

212
00:13:27.041 --> 00:13:28.660
so that you can increase capacity.

213
00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:32.920
There are also some other options that I outlined in that blog post.

214
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:37.750
So for that, if you are in the hospital systems, healthcare communities,

215
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.350
some of you will already be familiar with some of these options,

216
00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:46.300
but many of you will not please go to tim.blog forward slash ventilator,

217
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.600
and you will find that information. All right, so we've covered temp housing,

218
00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:50.643
we've covered food,

219
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:54.610
we've covered the personal protective equipment ventilators at home testing.

220
00:13:54.611 --> 00:13:59.050
I said, I'll keep people apprised of via email and also on social

221
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.850
and really last, because I don't have a solution for childcare.

222
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.760
That is another one that healthcare workers really need help with.

223
00:14:06.761 --> 00:14:11.230
I don't have a solution or a proposed solution right now for that. Uh,

224
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.230
Amazon can do something interesting here,

225
00:14:14.231 --> 00:14:16.810
and I suspect they already are on some level,

226
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.340
but to really make it publicly known and available so that

227
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.990
people can help. Amazon can create gift cards,

228
00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:30.700
vouchers that are restricted to, for instance, protective equipment.

229
00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.480
And my understanding could be incorrect,

230
00:14:34.481 --> 00:14:39.370
but that this would not then be taxable to the recipient as

231
00:14:39.371 --> 00:14:41.980
long as these are things that are absolutely needed.

232
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:46.570
And this also helps to minimize the likelihood of fraud,

233
00:14:46.571 --> 00:14:50.920
because one of the issues related to trying to help as that

234
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:54.110
fraudsters and cons and charlatans, uh,

235
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.860
will pop up and try to take advantage of these opportunities.

236
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:03.010
So Amazon can mitigate against that by creating

237
00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:08.380
gifts, cards, and vouchers that are restricted to protective equipment,

238
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:11.020
so that you could, for instance, go in,

239
00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:15.520
buy these cards and then provide them to your local hospital or local ER,

240
00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.310
or anywhere you grew up or wherever you would like to help.

241
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:22.540
There's probably a more elegant solution to distributing that widely,

242
00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:24.790
but Amazon, uh,

243
00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.940
is in a fantastic position to do a lot of good.

244
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:32.740
And I'm sure they're already doing a lot at Amazon of course, on Twitter.

245
00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.400
So that's a lot in one episode,

246
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:40.630
I know this is more of a PSA and a call to action than anything else,

247
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.820
but really we're going to get through this.

248
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.700
We will get through this. And

249
00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.720
right now, if you are,

250
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.930
it is the time to be a generous lifeguard,

251
00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.680
not a selfish drowning person. There are people who are drowning.

252
00:15:59.681 --> 00:16:03.010
There are people who really need assistance financially.

253
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.600
And if you have trouble paying for food, paying bills, other needs, et cetera,

254
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:09.430
please go to find help.org.

255
00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:13.360
And you can find free and reduced cost services for many things,

256
00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:17.950
and every city in the United States. But some of us are in positions to help.

257
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.130
More of us are in positions to help then, uh,

258
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.320
might realize that is the case.

259
00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:28.420
And as one of the doctors in New York city told me

260
00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.090
every small act goes a long way,

261
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.680
especially given how much fear there is among the staff medical staff that is

262
00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:36.850
they're being maxed out.

263
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:42.100
And even just thank you when you see them on the street,

264
00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:43.600
or if you see them on the street,

265
00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:46.930
if you want to say something to them on social media can be incredibly

266
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:51.490
meaningful, where millions of people now get to work from home for safety.

267
00:16:51.491 --> 00:16:53.920
These incredible people do not have that option.

268
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.620
And many of them take very seriously.

269
00:16:56.621 --> 00:17:00.820
The oath save made to protect and serve us

270
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:05.410
and in exchange, or at the very least,

271
00:17:05.411 --> 00:17:10.000
we need these people properly fed, rested, and able to continue fighting.

272
00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:11.500
We all depend on them.

273
00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:16.120
So last but not least say your things do it on social media,

274
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.810
say it to anyone. You know, who's involved on the front lines.

275
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.050
They're going to be separated from their families in some cases for extended

276
00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:27.340
periods of time. These are our first responders and frontline of defense.

277
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:32.470
And I'm taking it very, very seriously because we all depend on them.

278
00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:36.100
We have all depended on them and sometimes we just don't realize it,

279
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.850
but that is always, it's true. And one option,

280
00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:43.060
this may not be the best option, but in showing your solidarity,

281
00:17:43.061 --> 00:17:44.470
you could choose for instance,

282
00:17:44.471 --> 00:17:49.060
the color green and just create a boundary or some type of

283
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:53.880
highlight in your social profile that says I support medical,

284
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:58.290
right? So hashtag support, medical support, medical support,

285
00:17:58.291 --> 00:18:01.170
medical hashtag support, medical, and the color green, right?

286
00:18:01.171 --> 00:18:04.500
That's one thing that you can do, even if you don't have any money,

287
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.250
any contacts, any ability to think about Flexport, UberEATS,

288
00:18:08.251 --> 00:18:11.490
any of these things that I'm talking about, what else can you do to help?

289
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.560
You can also take some of these links that I am sharing,

290
00:18:16.561 --> 00:18:21.060
including tim.blog Ford slash ventilator for modifying and increasing capacity

291
00:18:21.061 --> 00:18:23.580
of ventilators or tinned up blog Ford slash fight.

292
00:18:23.581 --> 00:18:28.110
COVID where I will eventually be sharing different targeted,

293
00:18:28.111 --> 00:18:29.820
vetted options for people who want to help.

294
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:35.190
And I would say that is probably enough for this episode.

295
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:38.520
So thank you so much for listening. I appreciate you all.

296
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:43.860
I am really trying to put in the good fight to help as much as

297
00:18:43.861 --> 00:18:48.210
possible. I realize how fortunate I am to be safe,

298
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.230
to have food.

299
00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:55.020
And I take that as a moral obligation to do what

300
00:18:55.021 --> 00:18:58.830
I can to fight for people who are fighting for us. Thanks so much for listening.
