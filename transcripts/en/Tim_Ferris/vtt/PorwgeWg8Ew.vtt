00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.290
<v 0>I'm going to answer a question that I get in some form or another quite often,</v>

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.530
uh, this one is well-worded and it's from crispy,

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.300
who is in a few of the private Facebook groups where I do

4
00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:13.134
testing.

5
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.140
<v 1>Types. Here's the question?</v>

6
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.450
<v 0>How does Tim integrate creating artists flow in parentheses being</v>

7
00:00:20.451 --> 00:00:21.284
productive,

8
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.210
getting done in parenthesis self-reflection slash healing and transcendence,

9
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.130
and then in parentheses, going beyond oneself,

10
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.570
be it spiritually contributing to others, et cetera. In his full life.

11
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.500
The crux of the question is what he's learned on living a full life and how he's

12
00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:41.180
learned to allow it all in given that we have the same 24 hours in a day and

13
00:00:41.181 --> 00:00:43.010
365 days in a year,

14
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.060
and each of these endeavors could be all consuming of one's time and attention.

15
00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:49.130
Maybe it's balanced, maybe it's selective focus.

16
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.350
Maybe it's something very different. I'd appreciate.

17
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.900
<v 1>His view. So the question is how you incorporate it,</v>

18
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.020
these different facets.

19
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.100
<v 0>Or pieces of the pie chart into your life.</v>

20
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.060
I do not have a perfect answer. I don't think anyone has a perfect answer,

21
00:01:05.061 --> 00:01:09.860
but I can tell you what I have changed in terms of how I think about this

22
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.480
and how I implement it.

23
00:01:11.481 --> 00:01:15.410
That has helped me to trend in the right direction where I feel better.

24
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:19.460
I feel more holistically integrated, so to speak.

25
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.970
<v 1>So let's look at this. We have the creative.</v>

26
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.420
<v 0>Let's call that artistic flow, the productive, getting things done.</v>

27
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.500
Then we have the self-reflection slash healing slash transcendence going beyond

28
00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:33.380
oneself, whether they're spiritually contributing to others.

29
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.200
<v 1>Or otherwise, my.</v>

30
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.740
<v 0>Variance is that you will never find.</v>

31
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.270
<v 1>Mouse. So with that said again, that might sound pessimistic.</v>

32
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.520
The reason you won't find it is because.

33
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.690
<v 0>You have to schedule it.</v>

34
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.000
If you want any semblance of covering these bases.

35
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.980
<v 1>In your.</v>

36
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.450
<v 0>Day to day, week to week, month to month life. In my personal experience,</v>

37
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.110
it has to be calendared and scheduled in advance.

38
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.960
I'll give you a few examples of what this looks like for me.

39
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.940
Let's talk about being productive, getting done. I block out Mondays.

40
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.280
This is a Monday when we're recording right now,

41
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.180
just to give you an example where I will batch certain types of activities that

42
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:20.630
could be recording videos. It could be phone calls with my team.

43
00:02:20.631 --> 00:02:23.180
I do one-on-ones with my team members.

44
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.920
My employees administrative work is batched on Mondays.

45
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.830
I do a lot of my say podcast,

46
00:02:30.831 --> 00:02:33.080
recording and audio on Fridays.

47
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.730
And you'll notice that I'm not trying to cover the artistic, the productive,

48
00:02:37.731 --> 00:02:42.380
the transcendent, that, that the in one day I used to do that.

49
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.540
And the task switching costs,

50
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.850
the channel switching costs is extremely high for me

51
00:02:49.851 --> 00:02:53.540
personally, it doesn't work very well. There's a lot of grinding the gears,

52
00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:55.970
trying to move between those things. Therefore,

53
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.310
I block out days of the week where getting done,

54
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.630
there are also going to be a certain check boxes that need to be checked off

55
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.110
right now. I have one blog post per week that must be published.

56
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.160
That then gets blocked out in the calendar for writing time,

57
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.630
typically before noon or before lunch on a given day,

58
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.550
that will be my focus for creating before managing, right?

59
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:25.510
So create before you manage as a blog post that I recently put up on tim.blog,

60
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:27.340
if you want to check it out, that was reasonably popular.

61
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.670
<v 1>And those are all prescheduled.</v>

62
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.200
<v 0>Those are a few examples on a weekly basis being productive on a quarterly</v>

63
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:35.651
basis.

64
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:40.600
I also have a content creation week where I will answer various questions,

65
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.150
produce certain types of audio, focus on writing, et cetera,

66
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.650
get a lot done that can then be distributed over the next quarter.

67
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:48.760
The next three months,

68
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.260
that is a quarterly example of getting things done on the

69
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:57.670
artistic side. When I am home here in Austin.

70
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.280
<v 2>I will almost always.</v>

71
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.150
<v 0>Try to have at least one day per week and it doesn't vary. So this could be,</v>

72
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.870
say a Tuesday for a series of four to eight weeks,

73
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.860
or it could be on a Wednesday. Doesn't really matter.

74
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:16.480
But the consistency is what matters. I will have a 90 minute drawing lesson.

75
00:04:16.481 --> 00:04:17.410
First thing in the morning,

76
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.060
this is pre input before any type of email or anything that might.

77
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.940
<v 1>Distract me. I'll sit down.</v>

78
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.610
<v 0>With an art teacher and work on say.</v>

79
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.540
<v 1>Whether it's charcoal, pencil paint,</v>

80
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.270
you name it for graphic.

81
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.650
<v 0>Expression, right?</v>

82
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.550
That is prescheduled pre committed on the calendar.

83
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.910
Then we have the transcendent, the self-healing,

84
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.040
the reflective.

85
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.040
<v 2>Or introspective. Uh, I will.</v>

86
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.930
<v 0>Generally speaking at least once a quarter schedule one to two weeks</v>

87
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.330
semi to completely off grid.

88
00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:59.980
This will be in nature and I'm allowed to write, but I'm not allowed to read.

89
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.750
And this could coincide with fasting. It often does, but not always.

90
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.730
And this will be time that is blocked out once again in advance

91
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.260
and preferably prepaid for. So whether there's travel involved,

92
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.430
lodging involved, facilitators involved, who could be say,

93
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.540
breath workers.

94
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.430
They could be experts in some type of therapeutic modality like ifs or

95
00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:29.170
otherwise having these things booked on the calendar so that there is

96
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.240
a sunk cost fallacy that you can use to your advantage. You've already prepaid,

97
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.190
hopefully irreversibly for these things.

98
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:40.750
Therefore there's a penalty for canceling and you can use the very

99
00:05:40.751 --> 00:05:45.640
exaggerated human tendency of loss aversion to work to your benefit in this

100
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.750
type of example.

101
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.820
So this may seem like a very sterile answer

102
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.140
to a comprehensive big question. For me.

103
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.580
<v 2>It is very practical answer, and.</v>

104
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.760
<v 0>That is you have to put it in the calendar. If it's not in the calendar,</v>

105
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:06.020
it's not real that you are not going to find balance. You have to create it.

106
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.460
You have to fight every lesser tendency that you have.

107
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:12.920
<v 1>In my case, that will stymie.</v>

108
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.160
<v 0>And self-sabotage by putting it into the calendar.</v>

109
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.320
That is the only way that I have found to integrate these various

110
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:24.620
pieces into my life. And if I do not have them in my calendar,

111
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.450
it's not going to work. Things are going to break.

112
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.530
I'm going to neglect important areas and I'm going to pay the consequences as a

113
00:06:30.531 --> 00:06:31.070
result.

114
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.020
<v 1>So that is a.</v>

115
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.710
<v 0>Long way of saying, get it in the calendar, pay for stuff in advance,</v>

116
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.180
commit to people. So you have accountability. And in my experience,

117
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.010
a lot of things take care of themselves after that.
