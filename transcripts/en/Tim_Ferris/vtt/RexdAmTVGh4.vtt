<v 0>[Inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.990
do you have other ways of saying no that you

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.060
uses sort of default language or anything like that because people see what you

4
00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:18.890
do, right? I mean, you have so much in the air and you're,

5
00:00:18.891 --> 00:00:19.830
you're getting so much done,

6
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:23.040
but they don't see the thousands of things that you say no to. Right.

7
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.340
<v 1>I can say right now I am,</v>

8
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.550
I am so honest right now.

9
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.080
I'm so honest that it is

10
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.090
it's so it's ridiculous, right? Like right now I am,

11
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.980
I am no kidding. Absolutely not. No. 40 years old,

12
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.290
I got time to beat around the Bush for no why? I just don't want to do that.

13
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.820
I just don't. I don't want to do that.

14
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.030
I shouldn't have to explain why I don't want to do something.

15
00:00:56.031 --> 00:00:59.240
I shouldn't have to explain. That's a,

16
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.640
that's a thing that people have to overcome.

17
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.800
There's a portion of life that you go through where you feel guilty for saying

18
00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:09.650
that you don't want to do certain things.

19
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.800
It's not fair because when you do want to do things as celebrations in his happy

20
00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:19.760
times, but you're allowed to not want to do.

21
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.000
You're allowed the option to say, no,

22
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.930
you say no for things that work for you and good for you.

23
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.200
You can be saying no to opportunity for all. I know.

24
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.360
You're allowed the option to say no and to not

25
00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.360
want to participate or not want to do.

26
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.810
That's your choice in anything.

27
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.850
I know that. And I make sure that I use my nose wisely.

28
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.070
There's a lot of yeses.

29
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.920
So when there isn't no understand that. For example,

30
00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:58.250
I love my fans. I love my fans.

31
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.960
Take pictures of fans all the time, go back and forth with fans all the time,

32
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.970
make myself available before red carpets, after carpets move.

33
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.600
Premier's not moved to me as I'm out and about seeing them stop, talk, pitches,

34
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.250
videos. But if I'm with my kids, no,

35
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.730
Kevin, Keith. I said, no, I shouldn't have to explain to you.

36
00:02:19.731 --> 00:02:24.710
I'm with my family. I shouldn't have to do that. I'm entitled to know.

37
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.150
That's why you got two options. You got. Yes. And no,

38
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.410
you thought maybe an air that's your choice. Um, is a yes or no.

39
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.290
So as you get older,

40
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:39.350
you start to see that a little more clear and I joke around about it,

41
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.870
but it's so true. You haven't noticed how direct and honest,

42
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.970
old people are. Yeah, for sure.

43
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.930
Have you ever noticed the old person does not waste?

44
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.930
No. Yeah. Do it? No. Get your up, buddy.

45
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.310
Whatever it is. It's, it's, it's that red.

46
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.380
<v 2>Because they don't have the time. They don't have the time to play those games.</v>

47
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.490
I don't either. I don't play those games anymore.
