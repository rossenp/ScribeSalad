00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:06.210
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

<v 1>Books.</v>

5
00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:28.910
I've loved on the Tim Ferriss show is exclusively brought to you by audible.

6
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.980
There couldn't be a better sponsor for this series.

7
00:00:30.981 --> 00:00:34.970
My dear listeners and readers I've used audible for so many years,

8
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.860
as long as I can remember. I love it.

9
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.010
Audible has the largest selection of audio books on the planet.

10
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.550
I listen when I'm taking walks. I listen while I'm cooking.

11
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.150
I listen whenever I can. And if you're looking for a place to start,

12
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.700
I can recommend three of my favorites.

13
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.140
The first is the Tao of Seneca by Seneca.

14
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.610
If you want to hear my favorite letters of all time touches on stoic philosophy,

15
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.100
calmness under duress, et cetera.

16
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.270
The next is the graveyard book by Neil Gaiman,

17
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.450
G a I M a N one of my favorites,

18
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.580
even if you're a nonfiction purist,

19
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.310
this is the fiction book that you need to listen to.

20
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.170
Neo also has perhaps the most calming voice of all time and third,

21
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.500
Greg McKeown's essential ism subtitle.

22
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.360
The disciplined pursuit of less.

23
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.470
This is one of my favorite books of the past few years combines very well with

24
00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:31.010
the 80 20 principle, but more on audible every month.

25
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.800
Audible members get one credit for any audio book on the site,

26
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.180
plus a choice of multiple audible originals from a rotating selection.

27
00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:41.840
They also get access to daily news digests from the likes of the New York times

28
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:45.350
wall street journal and the Washington post as well as guided meditation

00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:48.740
programs. And here are some other amazing audible features.

30
00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:52.550
And I use a bunch of these. You can download titles and listen offline anytime,

31
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.250
anywhere I use this feature,

32
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.630
even when I could get access, I'll put my phone on say airplane mode,

33
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.730
because I don't want to get bothered with notifications.

34
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.900
And I'm taking a walk to clear my head and you can listen to titles offline in a

35
00:02:05.901 --> 00:02:07.730
case like that or on a plane or whatever.

36
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.260
Obviously I'm not flying much these days.

37
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.730
The app is free and can be installed on all smartphones and tablets.

38
00:02:13.731 --> 00:02:16.490
You can listen across devices without losing your spot.

39
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.630
And whisper sync is another feature I use quite a lot.

40
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.790
I love reading my Kindle in bed. For instance,

41
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.780
then picking up at the same exact spot where I left off.

42
00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:28.490
When I go walking and listening to the next day,

43
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.660
Kindle and audio versions can be synced up automatically is just amazing.

44
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.690
And if you can't decide what to listen to, don't sweat it.

45
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:36.524
You don't have to rush.

46
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.070

47

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.690
Hello, boys and girls, ladies and germs. This is Tim Ferriss.

62
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.670
Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show,

63
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.210
where it is usually my job to sit down with world-class performers of all

64
00:03:42.211 --> 00:03:46.290
different types, startup founders, investors, chess champions, Olympic athletes,

65
00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:49.830
you name it to tease out that habits that you can apply in your own lives.

66
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.420
This episode, however,

67
00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:56.010
is an experiment and part of a short form series that I'm doing simply

68
00:03:56.011 --> 00:04:00.600
called books. I've loved. I've invited some amazing past guests,

69
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.900
close friends and new faces to share their favorite books.

70
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.450
Describe their favorite books. The books that have influenced them,

71
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.820
changed them, transformed them for the better.

72
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.800
And I hope you pick up one or two new mentors in the form of books from this new

73
00:04:13.801 --> 00:04:15.990
series and apply the lessons in your own life.

74
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.170
I had a lot of fun putting this together,

75
00:04:19.171 --> 00:04:23.790
inviting these people to participate and have learned so so much myself.

76
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.820
I hope that is also the case for you. Please enjoy.

77
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.890
<v 3>My name is Debbie Millman and I am a designer, the author of six books,</v>

78
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.110
the editorial director of print magazine,

79
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.040
the chair of the masters in branding program at the school of visual arts in New

80
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.270
York city and host of one of the world's longest running podcasts design

81
00:04:45.271 --> 00:04:49.740
matters. When I was a kid, there were lots of rules in my house.

82
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.330
One of the most horrific for me at the time was the very limited amount of

83
00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:58.890
television I was allowed to watch as a result I read and I read a

84
00:04:58.891 --> 00:05:03.840
lot. I read books, magazines, newspapers, encyclopedias, and comic books.

85
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.340
I even borrowed my mother's red book and ladies' home journal and snuck into my

86
00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:12.240
father's library to read the steamy sections of the godfather.

87
00:05:12.241 --> 00:05:14.130
When I was sure that no one would catch me.

88
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.790
My fascination with books began as soon as I could read.

89
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.720
And golden books were my favorite. As soon as I got into grade school,

90
00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:25.530
I was introduced to the weekly reader and there was nothing, nothing.

91
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.210
I look forward to more than the moment every week when Mrs. Mayer handed out

92
00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:33.120
those gorgeous publications. By third grade,

93
00:05:33.121 --> 00:05:35.160
I was introduced to the Scholastic book club.

94
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.760
And while my folks were stingy with television privileges,

95
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.310
they were quite generous with my book allowance.

96
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.890
I ordered as many books as I could afford.

97
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.680
And when the boxes came in with my name on them,

98
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.030
I spent a moment gingerly fingering, the corrugated Brown carton.

99
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.360
I'd sit for a minute or two and imagine what was inside,

100
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.970
what the books would be like. And of course how they would,

101
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.010
I've been in love with books ever since in university.

102
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:04.490
I majored in English literature and minored in Russian literature.

103
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.060
And though I often joke now that I got a college degree in reading,

104
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.650
I really have no regrets books have sustained me, nourished me,

105
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:14.870
provided solace and lonely times.

106
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.000
And in one case inspired me to fall in love and subsequently changed my life.

107
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.630
The books of my list are some of the books that have inspired and moved me over

108
00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:26.810
the course of my life. These books, as Marcel, Preuss,

109
00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:28.850
famous description of the Madeleine,

110
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.380
ultimately reach the clear surface of my consciousness, this memory,

111
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.210
this old dead moment,

112
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.280
which the magnetism of an identical moment has traveled so far to in per

113
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:44.540
tune to disturb, to raise up out of the depths of my being.

114
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.580
But when from a long distant past nothing subsists after people are dead

115
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.530
after the things are broken and scattered taste and smell alone, more fragile,

116
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:57.860
but more enduring, more unsubstantial and more persistent,

117
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.600
more faithful remain poised in a long time like souls,

118
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:03.860
remembering, waiting,

119
00:07:03.861 --> 00:07:08.600
hoping amid the ruins of all the rest and bear unflinchingly

120
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.710
in the tiny and almost impalpable drop of their essence.

121
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.350
The vast structure of recollection,

122
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.180
the following books are some of my favorite and are told in the order of my

123
00:07:20.181 --> 00:07:24.740
discovering them the little golden book of words written by Selma.

124
00:07:24.741 --> 00:07:28.280
Lola chambers has been out of print for a long, long time.

125
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.130
Originally published in 1948.

126
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.970
It includes gorgeous illustrations by Gertrude Elliott.

127
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.270
And it is one of the first books I ever remember reading.

128
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.060
When I was trying to find the book again as an adult,

129
00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:43.340
I couldn't remember the title. I recalled.

130
00:07:43.341 --> 00:07:47.360
It had little scraps of paper on the cover and featured different illustrations

131
00:07:47.361 --> 00:07:50.420
of pets and fruit. Somehow I remembered a carrot.

132
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.460
I thought the book was about art.

133
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.080
As the main image I had in my head was simply poignantly rendered color

134
00:07:57.081 --> 00:08:00.140
wheels. Before, long before eBay,

135
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.280
I searched for the book in New York city flea markets. And finally I found it,

136
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.940
but I discovered it wasn't a book about art, ironically enough,

137
00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:11.390
it's titled words, but the color wheel was still there.

138
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.080
The entire book is magical and perfect in college.

139
00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:17.720
I read the life and opinions of Trish DRAM Shandy,

140
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:23.300
gentlemen by Lauren stern was first published in 1759

141
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.510
stern incorporated other texts from other books.

142
00:08:26.511 --> 00:08:30.380
Robert Burton's the anatomy of melancholy Francis Bacon's of death,

143
00:08:30.381 --> 00:08:32.600
and many more into Tristram Shandy.

144
00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.530
The book also references John Locke's theories of empiricism.

145
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.140
The way we organize what we know about ourselves,

146
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.760
be of the power of association of our ideas and employee's visual techniques

147
00:08:43.761 --> 00:08:46.820
never, ever seen before. In any book prior,

148
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:51.050
the book is remarkable in that are proceeds modernism, postmodernism,

149
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.590
and conceptual art by utilizing these techniques, blank chapters,

150
00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.060
black chapters, white pages, playful type, and doodles,

151
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.910
and it was all done in 1759.

152
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:08.130
The life and opinions of Trish tram Shandy gentlemen is now seen as a forerunner

153
00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:12.330
of the use of stream of consciousness and self-reflexive writing it is

154
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:14.310
blowing in its entirety.

155
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.170
And one of the most inventive original books ever written a book that I keep

156
00:09:19.171 --> 00:09:20.970
going back to over and over,

157
00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:24.270
and is one that I included in my interview with Tim Ferriss in his book,

158
00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:28.440
tribe of mentors is the anthology. The voice that is great within us,

159
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.850
American poetry of the 20th century, gorgeously, thoughtfully,

160
00:09:32.851 --> 00:09:34.980
and carefully edited by Hayden Kruth.

161
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.860
It was required reading in a summer college class.

162
00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:40.290
I attended back in the early 1980s.

163
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.740
This funny looking book introduced me to my most treasured,

164
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.640
deeply felt poem Maximus to himself by Charles Olson,

165
00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:51.930
which has since become the blueprint of my life as well as the poetry of Denise.

166
00:09:51.931 --> 00:09:56.550
Levertov Adrianne rich as Roy pound, while the Stephens and so many more.

167
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.560
I still have my original copy.

168
00:09:58.561 --> 00:10:02.940
And though the cover has come off and the spine is cracked in numerous places.

169
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.110
I will never replace it.

170
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:09.360
I first read love in the time of cholera by Gabriel Garcia Marquez in the late

171
00:10:09.361 --> 00:10:10.200
1980s,

172
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:15.090
the book takes place in an unnamed port city in the Caribbean and remains

173
00:10:15.091 --> 00:10:19.710
unnamed throughout the novel headstrong for Mina Daza is the female lead in the

174
00:10:19.711 --> 00:10:24.510
story. And after a brief love affair through letters with Florentino, Arissa,

175
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:29.430
she ultimately rejects him and Mary's UNL or Beano lovesick.

176
00:10:29.431 --> 00:10:30.420
And for Lauren,

177
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:35.580
our is obsessed and tormented by his love for foramina Daza it's no use.

178
00:10:35.581 --> 00:10:39.690
He tells his uncle at the beginning of the novel loves the only thing that

179
00:10:39.691 --> 00:10:44.100
interests me and love he does the Florentino.

180
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:48.000
Risa believes that for me to does it is his soulmate and vows to remain faithful

181
00:10:48.001 --> 00:10:48.540
to her.

182
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:53.070
He proceeds to engage in 662 affairs over the next 50 years.

183
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.790
He does this while sincerely believing that his,

184
00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.880
he is saving his heart and his virginity for her.

185
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:05.220
When for Mina's husband finally dies a reason immediately returns to her.

186
00:11:05.221 --> 00:11:09.210
And she slowly realizes that she has loved him her whole life, all along.

187
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:13.800
They embark on a voyage to sail the Magdalena river and in an attempt

188
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.650
to keep other passengers from boarding the boat,

189
00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.590
the captain raises the yellow flag of cholera.

190
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.270
He asks a reason for how long they could possibly keep coming and going in this

191
00:11:24.271 --> 00:11:28.920
manner forever is his one word reply love.

192
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:32.280
And the time of color is perhaps the most perfect book ever written

193
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.460
perverse optimist by Tibor, Kalman, and edited by Michael Beirut.

194
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:43.020
And Peter Hall truly influenced how I practice the discipline of design

195
00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:47.490
Tibor. Kalman was one of the most influential designers of the 20th century.

196
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.630
He founded the design from and company named for his wife,

197
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:56.380
Myra Calman and produced groundbreaking work for the talking heads restaurant

198
00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:59.380
Florent, the limited an interview magazine.

199
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.940
He also had a keen eye for great talent and hired the designers,

200
00:12:03.941 --> 00:12:08.680
including Stefan Sagmeister, Stephen Doyle, Emily Oberman, Alexander Isley,

201
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:10.870
Scott stolen Alexander Bremner,

202
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:15.040
who all went on to create their own firms or have joined other firms and have

203
00:12:15.041 --> 00:12:17.020
had great, great success.

204
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:22.180
Perverse optimist first published one year after [inaudible] death in 1999,

205
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:26.920
features, anecdotes and commentary from Calvin's clients, his staff,

206
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.900
his peers, and his friends.

207
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.400
It is an incredible book about an incredible designer thinker and bad boy

208
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:37.990
provocateur. My next book is general theory of love by Thomas Lewis,

209
00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.510
Faria meanie and Richard Lannon.

210
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.770
We are now surrounded by a world of activity that can't be seen.

211
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:49.570
The patterns produced by the splash of a raindrop happened too fast for our eyes

212
00:12:49.571 --> 00:12:53.860
to catch. Is it possible? We could direct our brains to see more.

213
00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.760
The authors have a general theory of love written in 2001, right?

214
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.740
This the scientist and artist is boost speak to the turmoil that comes from

215
00:13:02.741 --> 00:13:04.600
having a Tribune brain.

216
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:09.430
A person can not direct his emotional life and the way he bids his motor system

217
00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:10.360
to reach for a cup.

218
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.520
He cannot will himself to want the right thing or to love the right person or to

219
00:13:15.521 --> 00:13:19.810
be happy after disappointment, or even to be happy and happy times.

220
00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.440
People lack this capacity, not through a deficiency of discipline,

221
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:28.600
but because of the jurisdiction of will is limited to the latest brain and to

222
00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:32.920
those functions within its purview, emotional life can be influenced,

223
00:13:32.921 --> 00:13:34.210
but it cannot be commanded.

224
00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:39.370
Our society's love affair with mechanical devices that respond at a button touch

225
00:13:39.371 --> 00:13:43.990
does not prepare us to deal with the unruly organic mind that dwells within

226
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.550
anything that does not comply must be broken or poorly designed,

227
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.650
which as Charles Olson might say makes for difficulties and we're neocortex

228
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.180
brain has the ability to organize and convey logic and reason the limbic brain

229
00:13:58.181 --> 00:14:02.350
inspires and can involuntarily feel love yet. According to Lewis,

230
00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:07.300
the verbal rendition of emotional material demands a difficult transmutation

231
00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:08.201
poetry,

232
00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:12.820
a bridge between the neocortical and limbic brains is simultaneously improbable

233
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.713
and powerful.

234
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.670
A general theory of love is a book about human love in all its forms and is

235
00:14:18.671 --> 00:14:21.970
written in a brilliant poetry inspired narrative.

236
00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:24.640
I'm going to be talking about two books now together.

237
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:29.110
Pattern recognition by William Gibson and brand gap by Marty Neumeier

238
00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.960
in his novel pattern recognition.

239
00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:36.220
William Gibson has one of his characters describe branding in this way.

240
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.550
All truly viable advertising addresses the older,

241
00:14:39.551 --> 00:14:43.600
deeper mind beyond language and logic, you know,

242
00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:46.540
in your limbic brain, the seat of instinct,

243
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.560
the mammalian brain deeper, wider beyond logic.

244
00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.730
What we think of as mind is only a sort of jumped up gland piggybacking

245
00:14:55.731 --> 00:14:59.450
on the reptilian brainstem and the older mammalian mind,

246
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.710
but it is our culture that tricks us into recognizing it as all of

247
00:15:03.711 --> 00:15:04.640
consciousness,

248
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:09.920
the mammalian spreads continent wide beneath it mute and muscular

249
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:14.690
attending its ancient agenda. And it makes us buy things.

250
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:16.670
<v 4>I think that we do.</v>

251
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:20.030
<v 3>Buy things to help us fit in and feel more comfortable and being part of a</v>

252
00:15:20.031 --> 00:15:22.430
larger tribe. So to speak is no doubt.

253
00:15:22.431 --> 00:15:25.790
One of the benefits of branding brands create intimate worlds,

254
00:15:25.791 --> 00:15:29.840
inhabitants can understand and where they can be somebody and feel as if they

255
00:15:29.841 --> 00:15:30.674
belong.

256
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:34.550
I think Marty Neumeier States at best when he confides his thoughts about tribes

257
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.070
that he belongs to in his book, the brand gap,

258
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.480
we can belong to the Callaway club. When we play golf, the Volkswagen tribe.

259
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.600
When we drive to work the Williams-Sonoma tribe. When we cook a meal,

260
00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:49.340
the Nike club, when we work out, he goes on to say, as a weekend athlete,

261
00:15:49.341 --> 00:15:53.510
my two nagging doubts are that I might be congenitally lazy.

262
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.760
And then I might have little actual ability,

263
00:15:56.030 --> 00:16:00.200
but I'm not really worried about my shoes. When the Nike folks say, just do it,

264
00:16:00.201 --> 00:16:01.790
they're appearing into my soul.

265
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.240
I begin to feel that if they understand me that well,

266
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:07.940
their shoes are probably pretty good.

267
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:11.120
I am then willing to join the tribe of Nike,

268
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.470
but to see the world in brand tribes is to take position of much more than just

269
00:16:15.471 --> 00:16:19.670
a theory of the world. It is to possess a theory of all the activity in it,

270
00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:23.870
perhaps an entire science and ethos ology that could tell us everything we want

271
00:16:23.871 --> 00:16:25.310
to know about human behavior.

272
00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.240
I think the way Neumeier describes brands is probably one of the most poetic and

273
00:16:29.241 --> 00:16:32.300
forgiving of the place that products now have in our lives.

274
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.840
The mammalian part of our brain is indeed the part of the brain that makes us

275
00:16:35.841 --> 00:16:37.040
want to be part of a tribe.

276
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:41.780
And I do think that we buy brands that make us feel part of that tribe in order

277
00:16:41.781 --> 00:16:45.650
to be able to participate in that tribe. But I think it goes deeper than that.

278
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:49.400
We're buying brands and products to be part of a tribe because now in a day and

279
00:16:49.401 --> 00:16:53.690
age and culture and world we are living in, we are otherwise tribeless,

280
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.290
we feel tribalist and disconnected because despite our technological

281
00:16:57.291 --> 00:16:58.220
connectedness,

282
00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:02.510
we are emotionally and physically further away from our friends and family than

283
00:17:02.511 --> 00:17:06.890
ever before in human history. We've now replaced our closeness with people,

284
00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:07.971
with closeness,

285
00:17:07.971 --> 00:17:11.480
with brands that at best can only represent that we are close to others.

286
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:17.480
Pattern recognition is a novel written in 2002 before Facebook and YouTube had

287
00:17:17.481 --> 00:17:18.200
launched,

288
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:23.150
but somehow predicted the creation of both the brand gap was written in 2005,

289
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:27.020
but it is one of the first books to present a unified theory of brand-building

290
00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.120
individually. They're both great books,

291
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:33.260
but together they provide a unique perspective that the power of brands have in

292
00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:36.020
our lives. Building stories by Chris,

293
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:41.090
where Chris where's building stories published in 2012 is so much more than a

294
00:17:41.091 --> 00:17:45.230
book. It is 14 individual experiences full of,

295
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.430
and we heartbreak,

296
00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:51.120
joy and elation humans living their lives stacked in a box 14

297
00:17:51.121 --> 00:17:54.660
interlocking stories of the residents of Chicago apartment building.

298
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.440
The 14 pieces in building stories include a game board,

299
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.880
a newspaper to hardcover books and various ephemera filled with lonely

300
00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:05.280
frustrated people aching for connection.

301
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.240
There's the one legged 30 something woman who is also the central character

302
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.360
living on the top floor, frustrated with her husband,

303
00:18:12.361 --> 00:18:15.510
gaining weight and wondering what happened to her dreams.

304
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.930
There's a lonely old landlady living on the ground floor,

305
00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:22.800
a couple living in the middle floor with relationship problems and Branford,

306
00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:27.750
the best bee in the world who is truly a thinking B the design is not limited

307
00:18:27.751 --> 00:18:31.470
to the story of the presentation of the book. It is central to the narrative.

308
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:36.150
Bowling stories is remarkable and sets the stage for an entirely new way of

309
00:18:36.151 --> 00:18:36.984
storytelling.

310
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:41.310
My last book is the book hunger by Roxane gay.

311
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.780
When I first read Roxane Gay's 2017, New York times bestselling book hunger,

312
00:18:45.781 --> 00:18:49.260
a memoir of my body. I thought I was reading my own diary.

313
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:53.490
Her words hit me like few other books. Have I felt simultaneously seen,

314
00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:58.590
understood and heard all this from a book lines like I'm full of

315
00:18:58.591 --> 00:19:03.270
longing and I am full of envy. And so much of my envy is terrible. Just pierced.

316
00:19:03.271 --> 00:19:07.140
My heart. Mine was too. Then came this statement.

317
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:11.130
I was a gaping wound of need. I couldn't admit this to myself,

318
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.750
but there was a pattern of intense,

319
00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:17.130
emotional masochism of throwing myself into the most dramatic relationships

320
00:19:17.131 --> 00:19:21.810
possible of needing to be a victim of sun kind over and over and over.

321
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:26.130
That was something familiar, something I understood, man. Oh man,

322
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:29.970
did I understand that? I understood it until after a lot of therapy,

323
00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:34.050
I didn't understand it anymore. And then in an aberrant moment of courage,

324
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:39.090
I asked Roxanne to be a guest on my podcast. She said, yes. Then she said, no,

325
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.210
a year later, a generous friend put in a good word for me.

326
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:46.440
And I took Roxanne gay out on a proper date. Five months later,

327
00:19:46.441 --> 00:19:50.820
she was finally a guest on my podcast. And one year later we got engaged.

328
00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:55.710
Sometimes books take you to very unexpected places that change your life in

329
00:19:55.711 --> 00:19:56.580
every imagine.

330
00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.570
<v 0>Thanks for listening. Hey guys, this is Tim again,</v>

00:20:02.571 --> 00:20:05.660
just a few more things before you take off. Number one,

332
00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:10.940
this is five bullet Friday. Do you want to get a short email from me?

333
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:15.110
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

334
00:20:15.111 --> 00:20:18.680
little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

335
00:20:18.681 --> 00:20:23.000
short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

336
00:20:23.001 --> 00:20:24.290
pondering over the week.

337
00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.950
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered it could include

338
00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:32.930
gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird that I've somehow dug up in the,

339
00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.060
the world of the esoteric as I do.

340
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:40.220
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared

341
00:20:40.221 --> 00:20:43.670
with my close friends, for instance. And it's very short.

342
00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:48.760
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

343
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.010
So if you want to receive that, check it out,

344
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:55.960
