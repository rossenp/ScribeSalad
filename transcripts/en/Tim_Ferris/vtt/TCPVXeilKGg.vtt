<v 0>Optimal at this altitude,</v>

2
00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:06.230
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.460
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

4
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.501
<v 1>Books.</v>

5
00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:28.940
I've loved on the Tim Ferriss show is exclusively brought to you by audible.

6
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.010
There couldn't be a better sponsor for this series.

7
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:35.000
My dear listeners and readers I've used audible for so many years,

8
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.890
as long as I can remember. I love it.

9
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.070
Audible has the largest selection of audio books on the planet.

10
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.580
I listen when I'm taking walks. I listen while I'm cooking.

11
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.180
I listen whenever I can. And if you're looking for a place to start,

12
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.730
I can recommend three of my favorites.

13
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.170
The first is the Tao of Seneca by Seneca.

14
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.640
If you want to hear my favorite letters of all time touches on stoic philosophy,

15
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.130
calmness under duress, et cetera.

16
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.300
The next is the graveyard book by Neil Gaiman,

17
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.480
G a I M a N one of my favorites,

18
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.610
even if you're a nonfiction purist,

19
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.340
this is the fiction book that you need to listen to.

20
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.200
Neo also has perhaps the most calming voice of all time and third,

21
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.530
Greg McKeown's essential ism subtitle.

22
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.390
The disciplined pursuit of less.

23
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.500
This is one of my favorite books of the past few years combines very well with

24
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:31.040
the 80 20 principle, but more on audible every month.

25
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.830
Audible members get one credit for any audio book on the site,

26
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.210
plus a choice of multiple audible originals from a rotating selection.

27
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:41.870
They also get access to daily news digests from the likes of the New York times

28
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:45.410
wall street journal and the Washington post as well as guided meditation

29
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:48.800
programs. And here are some other amazing audible features.

30
00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:52.580
And I use a bunch of these. You can download titles and listen offline anytime,

31
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.280
anywhere I use this feature,

32
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.660
even when I could get access, I'll put my phone on say airplane mode,

33
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.760
because I don't want to get bothered with notifications.

34
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.930
And I'm taking a walk to clear my head and you can listen to titles offline in a

35
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:07.760
case like that or on a plane or whatever.

36
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.290
Obviously I'm not flying much these days.

37
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.760
The app is free and can be installed on all smartphones and tablets.

38
00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:16.520
You can listen across devices without losing your spot.

39
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.690
And whisper sync is another feature I use quite a lot.

40
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.820
I love reading my Kindle in bed. For instance,

41
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.810
then picking up at the same exact spot where I left off.

42
00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:28.520
When I go walking and listening to the next day,

43
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.720
Kindle and audio versions can be sinked up automatically is just amazing.

44
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.750
And if you can't decide what to listen to, don't sweat it.

45
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:36.584

61
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.730
Hello, boys and girls, ladies and germs. This is Tim Ferriss.

62
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.710
Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show,

63
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.250
where it is usually my job to sit down with world class performers of all

64
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:46.300
different types, startup founders, investors, chess champions, Olympic athletes,

65
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:49.870
you name it to tease out that habits that you can apply in your own lives.

66
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.460
This episode, however,

67
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.470
is an experiment and part of a short form series that I'm doing simply called

68
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.640
books. I've loved. I've invited some amazing past guests,

69
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.940
close friends and new faces to share their favorite books.

70
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.490
Describe their favorite books. The books that have influenced them,

71
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.860
changed them, transform them for the better.

72
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.840
And I hope you pick up one or two new mentors in the form of books from this new

73
00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:16.000
series and apply the lessons in your own life.

74
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.210
I had a lot of fun putting this together,

75
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:23.830
inviting these people to participate and have learned so, so much myself.

76
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.890
I hope that is also the case for you. Please enjoy.

77
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.530
<v 2>My name is Maria Popova and I am a reader and a writer.</v>

78
00:04:34.531 --> 00:04:39.510
And for 13 years now, I've been writing about what I read,

79
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.310
what I think about what I aspire toward on a website called

80
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.780
BrainPickings.

81
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.610
I also spent eight years on a labor of love that became the book of

82
00:04:50.611 --> 00:04:53.550
velocity of being letters to a young reader,

83
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.410
which is a collection of illustrated letters to kids about

84
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.380
the power and the joy of reading,

85
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.300
how it shapes who we become with contribution is by

86
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.510
121 of the most interesting people of our time.

87
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.490
Jane Goodall yo-yo ma came in Richard Branson and also a

88
00:05:14.491 --> 00:05:19.350
lovely letter from Tim with all proceeds from the book,

89
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.900
benefiting the New York public library system.

90
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.840
And I wrote a very thick,

91
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.120
very yellow book called figuring,

92
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.710
which looks at our human search for truth, for meaning,

93
00:05:31.711 --> 00:05:34.290
for self-actualization,

94
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.850
for love through the lives of several historical figures,

95
00:05:38.851 --> 00:05:43.530
spanning for centuries, beginning with the astronomer Johann Kepler,

96
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.480
who revolutionized our understanding of the universe with his laws of planetary

97
00:05:48.481 --> 00:05:52.980
motion and ending with the Marine biologist and author,

98
00:05:52.981 --> 00:05:57.210
Rachel Carson, who catalyzed the modern environmental.

99
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.860
And that is also how I read and what I read across discipline

100
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.760
burns across areas across sensibilities.

101
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.610
And that is the lens with which I've chosen.

102
00:06:09.611 --> 00:06:12.040
The three books I'm about to recommend.

103
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:16.600
There are also books wonderful in large part for being under oppression,

104
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.340
shaded books, um,

105
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.440
of quiet revolution that have kind of coarse beneath

106
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.820
the surface mainstream attention and awareness.

107
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.330
The first book is a tiny,

108
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.250
tiny gem of a book called letter from a hostage by Antoine

109
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.030
descent, exhibit the author of the little Prince, which is of course,

110
00:06:40.031 --> 00:06:42.530
one of the most beloved, uh,

111
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:47.350
I hesitate to say children's books of all time because I consider it

112
00:06:47.351 --> 00:06:52.300
really a work of philosophy and deep, deep, psychological insight. In fact, I,

113
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.060
uh, reread it about once a year,

114
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.540
every year and each time I find in it,

115
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.730
new revelations of meaning new existential remedies,

116
00:07:03.731 --> 00:07:07.690
really for whatever it is I'm struggling with in my own life for that particular

117
00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:10.330
moment. Um,

118
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:15.130
some Exupery was a commercial pilot before world war two.

119
00:07:15.131 --> 00:07:16.900
And once the war broke out,

120
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.820
he served as a pilot for the French military running reconnaissance missions.

121
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.961
At one point,

122
00:07:22.961 --> 00:07:27.610
he became a prisoner of war after his plane crashed over the Sahara desert

123
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:33.430
led her to a hostage is his slim memoir recounting that

124
00:07:33.431 --> 00:07:37.900
experience, reflecting on its deeper significance, um,

125
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.560
an that informed and inspired the little Prince,

126
00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:46.450
but also opened up these enormous questions of what

127
00:07:46.451 --> 00:07:49.960
does it mean to live? What is it? It's the wellspring of our humanity?

128
00:07:49.961 --> 00:07:50.794
How do we,

129
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.810
how do we keep our noblest impulses alive in the midst of

130
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.350
death and destruction and divisiveness? Um,

131
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.430
he is an incredibly poetic writer and

132
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:08.650
this is just an incredibly soulful humanistic

133
00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:13.660
book, but also incredibly lucid and helpful,

134
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.940
helpful in a very, uh,

135
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:20.350
practical sense that it goes down from the philosophical and the poetic,

136
00:08:20.351 --> 00:08:24.820
the practical sense of how do we live these human lives?

137
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:29.020
How do we live meaningfully and honorably and purposefully

138
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:34.090
despite the foibles and the imperfections of the world and,

139
00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.860
and of our own hearts.

140
00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.600
The second book is one that shines a sideways glance

141
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.530
on perhaps the most elemental of these questions.

142
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.520
It's called love and St. Augustine by Hannah orange.

143
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.000
And it's an improbable and,

144
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:55.000
and deeply insightful inquiry into the life.

145
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:59.940
The heart by one of the most incisive intellects who ever lived

146
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:04.560
in one of the greatest political thinkers, our civilization has produced.

147
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:09.900
It is her first book-length manuscript and the last to be published in

148
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:10.734
English.

149
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.720
It was post to mislead discovered amongst her papers by two women,

150
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:20.510
a political scientist, and a philosopher who were doing research on her

151
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:23.490
for half a.

152
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.760
After our run wrote this as her doctoral thesis in Germany in

153
00:09:28.761 --> 00:09:29.930
1929,

154
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:35.270
she obsessively revised and annotated the manuscript and

155
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.160
for the remainder of her life,

156
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:41.960
she honed her core philosophical ideas against Augustine's

157
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.823
Whetstone,

158
00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:47.990
contemplating the troublesome disconnect between

159
00:09:47.991 --> 00:09:50.000
philosophy and politics,

160
00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:54.680
particularly moral philosophy and politics as evidenced by the rise of

161
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:59.300
totalitarian regimes, which of course she later explored in her,

162
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:03.350
just, just shockingly relevant book, the origins of totalitarian. Yeah.

163
00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.840
And all, all the while in love and St. Augustine,

164
00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:13.730
she contemplates the nature of love and how to live with our

165
00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.000
fundamental fear of it's lost.

166
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.420
Here's just a tiny passage from it.

167
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:25.100
She writes fearlessness is what love seeks

168
00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:30.320
such fearlessness exists only in the complete calm that can no longer be

169
00:10:30.321 --> 00:10:33.110
shaken by events expected of the future.

170
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.850
Hence the only valid tense is the present. The now

171
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.950
it was from Augustine that around borrow the phrase,

172
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:47.390
a modern Monday love of the world, which would, uh,

173
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:52.370
become a defining feature of her philosophy and her, her core political concern,

174
00:10:52.371 --> 00:10:57.200
which was why do we succumb to,

175
00:10:57.201 --> 00:10:59.450
and why do we normalize evil?

176
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.380
The question at the heart of her now, iconic book,

177
00:11:03.381 --> 00:11:07.370
the banality of evil aren't identified as the root of tyranny,

178
00:11:07.371 --> 00:11:12.260
the act of making other human beings irrelevant again and

179
00:11:12.261 --> 00:11:15.590
again, she returned to Augustine for the antidote,

180
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:21.230
love my final and crowning pit cause a kind of

181
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.490
unifying force for the questions raised by the other two books.

182
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.450
It's a book by the astrophysicist gen 11,

183
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:34.010
who became a real life friend after I first encountered her through

184
00:11:34.011 --> 00:11:37.280
her beautiful writing. And, um,

185
00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:40.910
the book is called a madman dreams of Turing machines.

186
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.230
And perhaps it's best described as a,

187
00:11:45.231 --> 00:11:48.680
as a mathematical historical novel.

188
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:53.060
How's that for USB specificity, but,

189
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.340
but just aside,

190
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.300
any label really only loosely captures this

191
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.460
uncommonly original intellectually storing soulful

192
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:07.720
poetic book drawing on the real lives of two great

193
00:12:07.721 --> 00:12:11.770
geniuses to whom we owe much of what we take for granted today,

194
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:16.750
including my ability to record this and your ability to listen to its

195
00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:21.340
digital echoes across the space-time fabric of ones and

196
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.600
zeros, the great computing, pioneer Alan Turing,

197
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:29.230
and the great mathematician, a logistician Kurt girdle.

198
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:34.240
It's a book that looks at their lives to unpeel the

199
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:38.230
core of their genius and also of their tragedy,

200
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.630
and to look at how the two intertwine to give us these

201
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.490
remarkable people of,

202
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:49.810
of just immense impact and out of their lives arise.

203
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:54.340
These larger universal questions about the nature of genius,

204
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.660
the relationship between our suffering and our achievement

205
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.350
and the search for truth beyond logic.

206
00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.020
The book belongs to that very,

207
00:13:05.021 --> 00:13:09.580
very rare species of incredibly poetic books by working

208
00:13:09.581 --> 00:13:14.350
scientists by an author who happens to be one of the world's

209
00:13:14.351 --> 00:13:18.640
foremost, probably the foremost expert on black holes,

210
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:22.780
but it's also a writer of deeply poetic prose and,

211
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.200
and a thinker of deeply poetic thoughts.

212
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.360
It's a slim book.

213
00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.750
And I read it long before I knew Janna in person,

214
00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:37.060
and it really shaped the way I think about what literature can be.

215
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:41.950
It is extremely formed, bending genre, bending.

216
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.460
There is no analog, no book I can say it is like,

217
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:51.040
and it has really informed the way I think I write and in a

218
00:13:51.041 --> 00:13:54.460
great sense that I've only recognized in hindsight.

219
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:58.350
It really informed how I wrote figuring.

220
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:02.880
<v 3>Hello, I'm Tyler Cowen.</v>

221
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:06.870
I'm an economist at George Mason university and the Mercatus center.

222
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:11.310
I'm a blogger at marginal revolution and the host of a podcast called

223
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:15.240
conversations with Tyler. People sometimes don't believe me.

224
00:14:15.241 --> 00:14:20.100
When I talk about how many books pass through the house. If I'm not traveling,

225
00:14:20.101 --> 00:14:22.020
it's quite ordinary.

226
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:27.000
If I go through five or 10 books a day in which parts of them I've read,

227
00:14:27.001 --> 00:14:31.290
you can debate. Maybe it washes out to be reading two or three books a day,

228
00:14:31.291 --> 00:14:34.050
some good nights, you get to read five fall books, right?

229
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.490
But the important thing is to be ruthless with the books that are not good.

230
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.960
Just stop reading, put them down, usually throw them away. Don't give them away.

231
00:14:42.961 --> 00:14:45.540
You could be doing harm to people if you give them away.

232
00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.570
And my philosophy of reading is that no one reads quickly.

233
00:14:48.571 --> 00:14:51.980
So someone wants to ask me, well, how long did it take to read that book?

234
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.610
And I said, 57 years, I'm 57 years old.

235
00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.570
So the way you read well is just by reading a lot and by reading a lot,

236
00:14:59.571 --> 00:15:02.450
your whole life. And then when you go to read actual books, you're like,

237
00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.100
I know that, I know that I know that.

238
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.740
And you keep on going and you read much more quickly.

239
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.050
And that's really the way to read a lot.

240
00:15:09.051 --> 00:15:13.790
There are these compounding returns to being obsessed with reading and starting

241
00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:14.990
young and never stopping.

242
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:19.730
Sometimes authors just go on and on with bladder or with personal

243
00:15:19.731 --> 00:15:22.190
detail that has no relevance to the argument,

244
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:25.850
or they're just pages of terminology. And it's like, well,

245
00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.770
you might still give the book a chance,

246
00:15:27.771 --> 00:15:30.020
but you start turning the pages more rapidly.

247
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.240
And you're just waiting for some bit of meat.

248
00:15:32.241 --> 00:15:36.520
You're like out there desperate giving the author still a chance point.

249
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:41.110
You're like, no, sorry, zap. Throw it in the trash onto the next one.

250
00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.350
Most books are not half great and half horrible.

251
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.570
And you should look at a few different parts of the book,

252
00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.010
but especially these days,

253
00:15:48.011 --> 00:15:51.670
an author should be able to signal by putting some good stuff up front, right?

254
00:15:51.671 --> 00:15:55.690
Because people are less patient than they used to be a 19th century book.

255
00:15:55.691 --> 00:15:59.050
You need to give it more time. It may not get good until chapter three,

256
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:00.910
but these days, my goodness,

257
00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.570
you can tell so much sometimes just from the font of a book,

258
00:16:04.571 --> 00:16:08.320
like there are books with bad fond management books and you're like, Oh my God,

259
00:16:08.321 --> 00:16:11.650
it's that font again? And you to throw it out, you don't have to read it at all.

260
00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.870
A lot of books come to the home. So I get many review copies on a weekday.

261
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.930
I'll probably average getting five to 10 review copies,

262
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.510
probably I'm buying on average two books a day.

263
00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:27.580
Those have a much higher chance there. Then books, people give me, uh,

264
00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:31.390
all sorts of things. So, uh, books from my library that I'm rereading,

265
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:35.230
there's really just a heavy flower and you have to deal with it. Somehow.

266
00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:39.010
The best reading is focused reading when you're trying to solve some kind of

267
00:16:39.011 --> 00:16:39.844
problem.

268
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:44.560
So if I'm doing one of my own podcasts with a guest and then I'll read or reread

269
00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:46.270
everything, the guest is written.

270
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:50.140
Typically it's a reread because I have on guests. I like, and if I liked them,

271
00:16:50.141 --> 00:16:52.870
I've already read a lot of their stuff, right? So, uh,

272
00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:57.760
you're rereading with an eye toward what is actually interesting about this

273
00:16:57.761 --> 00:16:58.510
person.

274
00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:01.720
And you learn much more that way than if you just randomly pick up books.

275
00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.030
So I advocate reading books and clusters.

276
00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.600
The author can be the clustering factor. It can be the topic,

277
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.600
it can be the historical period. Uh,

278
00:17:10.601 --> 00:17:14.530
but you really get into a person's mind if you reread everything they've done

279
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.720
within the span of a few weeks or months,

280
00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:20.560
and then watch them on YouTube and just try to think about and write out notes.

281
00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:21.820
What am I going to ask them?

282
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:25.600
One of the very best ways to read is to have your own podcast.

283
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:30.730
You want to start with the problem or question when you're reading. And again,

284
00:17:30.731 --> 00:17:35.200
you want to read books together in groups and you want one of the early books to

285
00:17:35.201 --> 00:17:38.290
make the whole thing real or emotionally vivid to you.

286
00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:41.170
If you travel to a place that will do it automatically,

287
00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.540
but if you're not traveling, you want the book to do it.

288
00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:48.400
So your early book choice is quite important and then many areas.

289
00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:51.510
So take the case of ancient Egypt. As you mentioned,

290
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.150
I don't know what's the best book on ancient Egypt,

291
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:58.860
but I know there's enough uncertainty about what went on in ancient Egypt.

292
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:01.320
That there's probably not a clearly well-defined,

293
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.480
here's the best book on ancient Egypt.

294
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.130
So you want to read 10 or 20 of them and do a kind of cross sectional,

295
00:18:08.131 --> 00:18:12.930
mental econometrics and see which pieces start fitting together and,

296
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:16.710
uh, take it from that. So in so many areas, it's a mistake, Oh,

297
00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:18.900
what's the best book on X. Rather,

298
00:18:18.901 --> 00:18:22.230
you're looking for some kind of portfolio of books on X.

299
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.990
My first recommendation would be fiction.

300
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.670
Reading fiction is important to understand the cross sectional variation in

301
00:18:29.671 --> 00:18:30.504
humanity,

302
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:35.100
to understand how difficult generalizations can be to just get a sense of how

303
00:18:35.101 --> 00:18:39.540
social pieces fit together and to get a sense of different historical areas.

304
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.870
Plus reading fiction is often just plain flat out fun.

305
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:48.000
So I think my fiction read, I found the most rewarding was Marcel Proust,

306
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.960
remembrance of things past, which comes in multiple volumes.

307
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:55.770
It's a very long read. I'd say about a third of it is quite boring,

308
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:57.600
but the peaks are just amazing.

309
00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:01.710
And it's also hilarious and it's about how inner monologues work and why

310
00:19:01.711 --> 00:19:06.060
expectation matters and what disappointment feels like and what is jealousy

311
00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:06.630
like?

312
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:10.980
And what's it mean to be a kind of total failure in a social world or to climb

313
00:19:10.981 --> 00:19:14.700
and reach higher levels of status. So I think that's just a thrilling,

314
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:18.780
remarkable set of volumes. Some of the very best parts came early.

315
00:19:18.781 --> 00:19:20.610
So the first two volumes are incredible.

316
00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.480
The last volumes incredible what comes in between is more uneven,

317
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:28.890
but you always feel he's going to come back to the main storylines you care

318
00:19:28.891 --> 00:19:32.460
about. And even the bad parts, they're not that bad. Uh,

319
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.340
but it could have been edited down a bit, right? Let's be honest.

320
00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:38.280
The second book I'll recommend is a book on the management,

321
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:41.790
except it's not really books about management at all. It's something else.

322
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.240
Let me explain. Well, I'm against most books on management.

323
00:19:45.241 --> 00:19:48.300
The worst way to learn management is to read a book on management.

324
00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.600
I recommend to people read a book on something you know about.

325
00:19:51.601 --> 00:19:52.920
So if you're a football fan,

326
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.820
I read about Vince Lombardi or read Jerry Kramer's instant replay.

327
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.510
My favorite book on management is a book about the classic rock group,

328
00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:04.770
the birds BYO RDS it's by Johnny Rogan. It's called timeless flight.

329
00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:08.430
It's hundreds of pages about how the birds split up and couldn't work together.

330
00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.670
And it's brilliant. It helps you understand small groups.

331
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.450
I work in small groups a lot. I'm not saying you should read that book.

332
00:20:15.451 --> 00:20:18.840
You need to know about the birds for the book to make sense, pick an area,

333
00:20:18.841 --> 00:20:19.231
you know,

334
00:20:19.231 --> 00:20:24.210
really well and read a book about actual substantive events that in no way

335
00:20:24.211 --> 00:20:27.210
has management in the title and is not in the management section of the

336
00:20:27.211 --> 00:20:30.870
bookshelf. And then maybe you'll start learning something about management.

337
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.250
Very often the books that are vivid to me are books I've read recently or in the

338
00:20:35.251 --> 00:20:39.300
last year and a book. I think it was very, very famous in its time.

339
00:20:39.301 --> 00:20:42.270
One of the best salaries of its century, but people have stopped reading it.

340
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.620
And that is Harriet Beecher Stowe, uncle Tom's cabin,

341
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:51.370
which is a book about migration. A book about travel, a book about race,

342
00:20:51.371 --> 00:20:53.260
obviously a book about slavery,

343
00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:58.450
a book about America in the middle of the 19th century. It has vivid characters.

344
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:02.230
The issues may be for a while, seemed obsolete, but they're highly,

345
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:03.850
highly relevant today.

346
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:09.190
It just bleeds a kind of humanity on virtually every page and communicates what

347
00:21:09.191 --> 00:21:13.990
the suffering is like of being in a tragic situation and how there are some

348
00:21:13.991 --> 00:21:18.550
structural features of America that tend to breed those kinds of tragedies

349
00:21:18.551 --> 00:21:23.260
slavery. And in that day, often on migration issues today. So I would say,

350
00:21:23.261 --> 00:21:24.130
go back and read it.

351
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.190
There's a reason why it was one of the two or three best-selling books of the

352
00:21:27.191 --> 00:21:30.550
19th century. Those people were not stupider than we were.

353
00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:34.210
It's a somewhat different context. It's a bit long, but once you pick it up,

354
00:21:34.211 --> 00:21:37.870
you're immediately in the book and the way you would be engrossed in say a

355
00:21:37.871 --> 00:21:42.340
popular novel. And indeed it was a popular novel in its time. I would say,

356
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.260
if you're looking to read memoirs,

357
00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:48.490
don't necessarily follow other people's recommendations,

358
00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:52.120
focus on reading memoirs and areas, you know, something about,

359
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:56.440
and then just Google to online lists. What are the best memoirs in that area?

360
00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:00.640
And read a bunch of those. And then here's the other next thing you should do.

361
00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:03.160
Every area you don't give a about,

362
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:07.720
you probably should read at least one book in because the very best book in that

363
00:22:07.721 --> 00:22:10.540
area is superb. And you're not going to know what it is.

364
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.260
So if tennis is something you don't know anything about, well read Andre,

365
00:22:14.261 --> 00:22:16.390
Agassi's memoir. That's a wonderful book.

366
00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:20.200
You don't have to know or care about tennis and just go through other areas,

367
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:24.730
gardening, dogs, turtles, whatever, find the best book on dogs and read it.

368
00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.680
And the less you like dogs, actually,

369
00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:29.860
the better that book is going to be because you are not sick of the topic.

370
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:32.650
Here's a book I read last night. It's by Scott H.

371
00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:37.060
Young it's called ultra learning. The subtitle is master hard skills,

372
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:39.880
outsmart the competition and accelerate your career.

373
00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:43.750
I'm all for all those things. How did I get this book? I met Scott.

374
00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.720
I had lunch with Scott. He gave me a copy of his book.

375
00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:51.670
It's actually not a bad filter to read the books of people you

376
00:22:51.671 --> 00:22:55.120
meet because them getting to meet you is itself a kind of filter.

377
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:58.750
And if they get through that filter, then maybe their book is interesting too,

378
00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:03.370
because you have structures set up to match people to you based on shared

379
00:23:03.371 --> 00:23:05.680
interests. So I care a great deal about the topic.

380
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:09.910
I had a lot of fun with Scott and I learned Scott is this guy who learned a

381
00:23:09.911 --> 00:23:12.970
whole bunch of languages on his own in just a few months time.

382
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.680
And he just kinda mastered them.

383
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.190
And he teaches you a secrets on how to learn things quickly.

384
00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.890
And that's been an obsession of mine since I was a kid.

385
00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:25.360
So this is a book very much after my own heart. If you're a knowledge worker,

386
00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:28.330
you want to be better, earn more advanced your career.

387
00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.610
You can't just sit back and be complacent.

388
00:23:30.611 --> 00:23:33.490
You need to be thinking every day in a sense every minute,

389
00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:35.980
how am I training myself to get better?

390
00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.540
You're much more like an athlete or a concert pianist or a chess player than you

391
00:23:40.541 --> 00:23:42.580
might think. And the people who do really well.

392
00:23:42.581 --> 00:23:44.320
They're just always self-training.

393
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.470
So how you should self-train depends on your job. Uh,

394
00:23:48.471 --> 00:23:52.250
one way I self-trained is just by doing like my own podcast conversations with

395
00:23:52.251 --> 00:23:54.170
Tyler, I try to figure out like,

396
00:23:54.171 --> 00:23:58.400
what's the code to what a famous person has done or achieved and how does it all

397
00:23:58.401 --> 00:23:59.234
hang together?

398
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:03.320
And then I talked to them about it and I know I'm going to be talking to them

399
00:24:03.321 --> 00:24:06.530
about it. So I can't just screw it up. Like, that's the ultimate test.

400
00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.770
You can't say, you know, to Martina Navratilova, Oh,

401
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.800
here's what you really did in tennis. And she'll tell you you're full of it.

402
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.530
So that's like an immediate reality test.

403
00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:19.880
Another method I use for training is just to keep on writing,

404
00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.660
always be writing don't care if it never sees the light of day and write out

405
00:24:23.661 --> 00:24:28.010
points of view that are not your own. It's just practice for thinking.

406
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.160
Writing is thinking if your writing isn't clear,

407
00:24:31.161 --> 00:24:32.630
probably your thinking isn't clear.

408
00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.220
So just always be thinking like I'm an athlete. I'm like some version of,

409
00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.000
you know, Sabine, your famous athlete. What do they do to train?

410
00:24:41.001 --> 00:24:44.810
What am I doing to train now? And if they're ahead of you, like, you know,

411
00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:49.310
catch up, people don't read enough. I think as a society we're,

412
00:24:49.311 --> 00:24:53.480
under-investing in reading, uh, people feel compelled to finish books.

413
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:55.790
They've started. That's just a tax on your reading.

414
00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:58.310
Why would you do that to yourself? Uh,

415
00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:03.050
imagine a world where any restaurant you tried, you had to keep on going there,

416
00:25:03.051 --> 00:25:06.770
you know, for days or weeks you'd hardly ever go out to eat, uh,

417
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.450
take reading seriously,

418
00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:13.010
develop a passion for it and view it as part of your practice as a knowledge

419
00:25:13.011 --> 00:25:16.940
worker to get ahead. But along the way, having fun doing so.

420
00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:21.880
<v 0>Hey guys, this is Tim again, just a few more things before you take off.</v>

421
00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.760
Number one, this is five bullet Friday.

422
00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:28.090
Do you want to get a short email from me?

423
00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:32.260
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

424
00:25:32.261 --> 00:25:35.830
little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

425
00:25:35.831 --> 00:25:40.150
short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

426
00:25:40.151 --> 00:25:41.470
pondering over the week.

427
00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.130
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered it could include

428
00:25:45.131 --> 00:25:49.870
gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird that I've somehow dug up in

429
00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.210
the world of the esoteric as I do,

430
00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:57.370
it could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared

431
00:25:57.371 --> 00:26:00.850
with my close friends, for instance. And it's very short.

432
00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:05.920
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

433
00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:08.170
So if you want to receive that, check it out,
