00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 0>My hope is that in listening to either book people find it</v>

2
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:09.570
reassuring that so many of the people they might put on a pedestal have all the

3
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:10.130
same problems.

4
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:10.963
<v 1>They do.</v>

5
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.400
It's not that they succeed because they lack and securities or lack

6
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.190
problems or lack self-defeating habits.

7
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.070
It's that they've figured out how to manage those things.

8
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.380
These world-class performers don't have super powers. The rules they've cracked.

9
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:31.603
<v 0>Crafted for themselves,</v>

10
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.210
allow the bending of reality to such an extent that it might seem that way,

11
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.940
but they've learned how to do this. And so can you,

12
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.380
these so-called rules are often uncommon habits in bigger cases.

13
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.130
<v 1>So if you want to change your life significantly,</v>

14
00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:48.440
you want to change your business or career significantly.

15
00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:51.350
You want to change how you relate to other people. Significantly.

16
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.420
The magic is really in the questions.

17
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.580
These two books can give you not just a set of toolkit of better

18
00:00:58.581 --> 00:00:59.414
questions,

19
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.490
but the increased ability to craft questions of your own.

20
00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:08.780
They get you the results you want. And that is as close to a superpower,

21
00:01:08.781 --> 00:01:13.370
as I think is possible in a surprising number of cases,

22
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.130
the power is in the absurd, the marble.

23
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.290
<v 0>The more impossible, the question, the more profound the answers take,</v>

24
00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:23.210
for instance, a question that serial billionaire,

25
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.160
Peter teal likes to ask himself and others.

26
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.420
If you have a ten-year plan of how to get somewhere, you should ask,

27
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.520
why can't you do this in six months for purposes of illustration here,

28
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.080
I might reword that to what might you do to accomplish your tenure goals in the

29
00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:39.380
next year.

30
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.600
<v 1>Six months, if you had a gun against your head,</v>

31
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.950
I do recommend that everybody pursue, if they can,

32
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.380
the bare bones of drawing, let's say the bare bones of music,

33
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.420
just so they develop greater sensitivity in seeing and hearing and

34
00:01:56.421 --> 00:01:58.670
listening because that transfers to everything.

35
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.330
Number one is 20 minutes of seated meditation in the morning.

36
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.640
Number two would be journaling in some short form,

37
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.610
isolating the things that are most important to get done that day,

38
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.050
the big dominoes to tip over,

39
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.130
or if you're feeling really stressed out morning pages from Julia Cameron. Very,

40
00:02:19.131 --> 00:02:23.030
very helpful. Then if I had to pick a third, I would say

41
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.580
a short bout of exercise. If I check those three boxes,

42
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.640
every day feels more in control.
