00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.000
<v 0>Hey guys, Tim Ferriss here and wanted to talk about note taking,</v>

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.460
I have what you might call hypergraphia,

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.130
which means I write all the time.

4
00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:10.710
So I have hundreds of notebooks.

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.460
So I feel like I'm in a pretty good position to talk about what the hell to do

6
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.960
with lots of notes.

7
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:20.580
You need a systematic way of filtering the best stuff to the

8
00:00:20.581 --> 00:00:23.010
top of your attention, at least in some fashion.

9
00:00:23.011 --> 00:00:26.400
So I'll show you a few ways that I do that. It's pretty straightforward,

10
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.740
but the key to all of it is multiple passes for almost all types of

11
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.191
note-taking.

12
00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:35.730
And I'll describe a few different types of note-taking that I do regularly.

13
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.740
The key is multiple passes and constantly asking in effect,

14
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.860
what did I think was important or cool that isn't that important or cool,

15
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.300
and then only selecting the absolute and distilling the absolute best.

16
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.200
So let's take a look at something really small, right?

17
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.340
This is the type of notebook that I would put in a pocket, a back pocket.

18
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.790
And this is from an event. It was actually a very good event,

19
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.770
which was a vanity fair event in San Francisco many years ago.

20
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.180
I want to say around 2013, and I'll show you, uh,

21
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.950
one of the exercises that I like to do when I'm feeling overwhelmed or feeling

22
00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:17.850
like I need a reset, which I do certainly around new year's.

23
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:20.310
And there are certain seasonal times and I like to reflect.

24
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.470
So I made a list and the top is very simple,

25
00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:30.470
craziest things I could do or eliminate or a limb in parenthesis.

26
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.633
So

27
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.260
I wrote this very quickly and, uh,

28
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.680
part of the point of the exercise was to write quickly and come up with all of

29
00:01:39.681 --> 00:01:44.360
the craziest things I could do that might alleviate stress. Now shut down.

30
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:47.480
Blog was one. The next one, because this is on multiple passes.

31
00:01:47.481 --> 00:01:52.340
Stop all social media schedule for three months. Question Mark, sell all homes,

32
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.540
stop using money, stop eating for 30 days, cut off feet,

33
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.790
turn up. Not to be something I wanted to do so it didn't cut off my feet.

34
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.290
Give away all money,

35
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.090
buy one house with all money live penniless for one year volunteer in a

36
00:02:08.091 --> 00:02:11.090
retirement home. Okay. So the,

37
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.970
the volunteer in retirement home requires a whole lot of explanation,

38
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:17.990
but I thought that it would be invigorating and karmically.

39
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.280
Wonderful to do that, particularly with, uh,

40
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.630
ideally a dog like my current dog, Molly, nonetheless,

41
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.290
I did not cut off my feet. I did not stop eating for 30 days.

42
00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:32.840
Although I later did multiple 10 day fasts.

43
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.300
The point of this whole list is to come up with lots of crazy ideas.

44
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.600
They can be bad, they should be absurd. They should seem absurd.

45
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.650
And then perhaps out of all those terrible ideas,

46
00:02:45.651 --> 00:02:49.790
you'll find one that will productively stretch your mind enough,

47
00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:51.950
that you find a solution you wouldn't have considered otherwise.

48
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.410
And in this case, stop all social media.

49
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.470
Schedule it out for three months was the one of the entire list and list goes

50
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:04.270
on that I ended up choosing and it completely changed how I related to using

51
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:05.104
social media.

52
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.420
And now that is a regular component of taking off-grid time to recharge

53
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.750
and scheduling things in advance, using many different tools,

54
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.430
whether that's buffer Edgar or Zapier, like happier,

55
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.130
not Zapier. I say that for automating,

56
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:24.700
a lot of this is also very helpful from say Instagram to other platforms.

57
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:25.534
And so on.

58
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.880
That is one example of note taking and then reviewing.

59
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.620
So the boxing and circling was a second pass.

60
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.450
Say a week later after the event,

61
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.170
then the highlighting was yet another pass.

62
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.180
Say a quarter later,

63
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.970
I don't know the exact timing on this because I did done it quite quickly,

64
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.790
but there is a schedule for reviewing.

65
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.970
So you're not just spewing onto the page and then forgetting it with the

66
00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:53.280
exception of the next thing that I'm going to show you.

67
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.930
So this is the expedient in the pocket brainstorm type of notebook.

68
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.290
And I'll, I'll show you one more. I'm going to cover it up a little bit,

69
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.280
just to protect names. You can see here,

70
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.890
I've got vanity fair event.

71
00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:11.010
I have a couple of names at the top that were interesting to me, uh,

72
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.630
Graydon Walter Isaacson,

73
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.010
who I much later ended up interviewing on the podcast who is a brilliant guy,

74
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.050
incredible writer, and then a bunch of quotes.

75
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.980
So playing the ratings game prevents you from taking risks. That's Ted Sarandos,

76
00:04:22.981 --> 00:04:26.490
Netflix Seinfeld took four years to find an audience.

77
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.160
Madman was turned down 66 times by buyers. I highlighted these,

78
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.900
they made three passes because I felt like these were incredibly inspiring

79
00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:41.040
reminders that overnight successes rarely are overnight successes.

80
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.260
And then the bottom, right? Uh, it is action steps that I've listed.

81
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.180
And I create these boxes in the bottom

82
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.390
right-hand corner. I'm right-handed might be easier on the left for lefties.

83
00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:55.080
I don't know,

84
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.310
but I create a box in the bottom right-hand corner of all these pages so that I

85
00:04:59.311 --> 00:05:02.810
can put yeah. Potential action steps. The other thing,

86
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.770
what I'll do is I will number these pages and a lot of this can't

87
00:05:07.771 --> 00:05:11.430
show you guys. So, uh, but suffice to say,

88
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.060
if you see that you see page 39, it's kind of hard to see,

89
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.370
but I will number the right hand pages. So one, two,

90
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.210
three, four, five, and then I create an index later,

91
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.380
which I probably can't show you either because there's too much top secret

92
00:05:28.381 --> 00:05:31.860
stuff, create an index in the beginning of a notebook,

93
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.140
much like the index that I would use in books and I'm reading so that I

94
00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:40.560
can find highlights later. And you might ask, well,

95
00:05:40.561 --> 00:05:43.680
what about the pages that don't have numbers? That's easy. That's 0.5.

96
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.460
All right. So if the number on the right hand side is say,

97
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.350
page two, flip it over on the back of that page in the index,

98
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.530
it would just be 2.5. So that's how I keep track of something like this.

99
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.520
The next type of writing that I'll describe is morning

100
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:03.060
pages. And, uh,

101
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.310
I'm not going to show you this page morning pages popularized by Julia Cameron

102
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:11.990
introduced to me by a fantastic writer and friend Brian Koppelman

103
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.490
of rounders fame.

104
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.720
The Allusionist co-creator of billions really fantastic guy.

105
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.960
Who's given me a lot of feedback on my writing,

106
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:25.610
helpful feedback on my writing introduced me to morning pages as a

107
00:06:25.611 --> 00:06:30.500
superpower of sorts for many of his high achieving creative friends who

108
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:32.780
are professional writers, producers, et cetera.

109
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.780
And the purpose of morning pages is not to write down of stuff

110
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.260
that you will then vet 17 times.

111
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.240
The purpose of morning pages is very different.

112
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.380
It as Julia Cameron who wrote the artist's way, Mike put it,

113
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.790
they are acting these pages as spiritual windshield wipers.

114
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.740
So you're taking the anxiety that you might feel the

115
00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.350
distraction, your monkey mind,

116
00:06:59.351 --> 00:07:02.740
and trapping it on paper so that you can get on with your day.

117
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.710
And sometimes they're gems that pop out,

118
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.840
but very often it's really taking a nebulous fear or a nebulous discomfort

119
00:07:10.841 --> 00:07:13.930
or fidgetiness whatever it might be and putting it on paper.

120
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.150
First thing in the morning, hence the name of morning pages.

121
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.410
She recommends three longhand pages. And I'll just give you an example.

122
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.270
So this is from July of last year and I'll

123
00:07:25.271 --> 00:07:28.060
put the location and so on. Uh,

124
00:07:28.061 --> 00:07:31.630
and there is a morning pages workbook that I really liked, but I just,

125
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.120
I just did it in a notebook I happen to have. Here's what I said.

126
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.410
I'm worried and anxious about the notebook, the irony, why? Well,

127
00:07:38.411 --> 00:07:41.380
I have four to six weeks, maybe a bit more based on the agreement.

128
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.320
What's the worst that can happen really?

129
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.830
And then I made a bunch of bullets spend the summer working on an end.

130
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.820
I thought I have to push the deadline. Hyphen fine,

131
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.590
cancel the book and return the advance. Fine. I could still put it on the blog.

132
00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.160
Next bullet, make it super short and only great stuff.

133
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.100
Meaning only include great stuff. Say it straight, then say it. Great. Yeah,

134
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.040
it means getting the facts down almost like a,

135
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:10.540
a computer or iPad instruction manual,

136
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:14.050
and then trying to improve the pros and say it more cleverly,

137
00:08:14.051 --> 00:08:15.400
put it more cleanly later.

138
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.600
Next I'm feeling uncertain about what to do next or first each day.

139
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.480
And then a bunch of bullets. Just get it all in one or fewer places.

140
00:08:22.481 --> 00:08:24.730
So gathering from notebooks, from digital,

141
00:08:24.731 --> 00:08:28.300
from Evernote all into one place or to the main chapters, right?

142
00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:29.950
And intro and conclusion question Mark.

143
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.460
Remember the humor can include ridiculous stories, such as a, B, C, D,

144
00:08:33.461 --> 00:08:36.730
et cetera. You can see, and you can hear,

145
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:41.020
this is not good writing and it's not intended to be good writing.

146
00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:44.800
It's intended to be brain vomit. And that's the whole point.

147
00:08:44.801 --> 00:08:48.670
So morning pages I found incredibly helpful for stress, right? Duction,

148
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:53.230
not principally for insight or structured thinking.

149
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.850
It is unstructured

150
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.950
trapping of your neuroses and anxieties in the Amber. That is the reason page.

151
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.240
So those are morning pages and, and last but not least,

152
00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:10.430
we got this guy five minute journal and I will actually read an

153
00:09:10.431 --> 00:09:12.050
example, uh,

154
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.950
because the format is very straightforward and I can show you what it looks

155
00:09:15.951 --> 00:09:19.910
like. This is what the, this is what the format looks like,

156
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:24.950
and I'll get you a quote, right? So let's find a good quote.

157
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.820
All right. So here we go. So here's the basic format.

158
00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:32.480
You've got the date at the top of the page. You can get a quote sometimes good.

159
00:09:32.481 --> 00:09:35.060
Sometimes not doesn't really matter, but some of them are fantastic.

160
00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:39.890
Then the prompts. So for the am doing this say in the morning,

161
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.100
I'm grateful for one, two, three, what would make today? Great. One, two,

162
00:09:43.101 --> 00:09:47.930
three daily affirmations. I am blank blank then after it is complete,

163
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.740
say before dinner, before bed three amazing things that happened today. One,

164
00:09:51.741 --> 00:09:54.950
two, three. How could I have made today? Better one, two.

165
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:59.150
Now this might seem simplistic.

166
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.100
It might seem hokey,

167
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.610
but it is first and foremost,

168
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:09.590
simple and complexity fails. If I've learned anything.

169
00:10:09.591 --> 00:10:14.360
That is certainly one of the things that I've learned and I've used the five

170
00:10:14.361 --> 00:10:18.650
minute journal for years in different capacities. And, uh,

171
00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:23.000
I am trying to find one that I can share with you, but I'll give you,

172
00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:26.090
I'll give you an example. Uh, and there are many, many,

173
00:10:26.091 --> 00:10:29.480
many that I could pull out. All right.

174
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:33.950
So I'm going to read, and there are some guidelines that I've been given.

175
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:39.380
And for many of these, I put prompts at the top that I want to remind myself of.

176
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.320
Uh, so one of the prompts that I've used

177
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:48.500
is state story strategy and their arrows that

178
00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:51.410
pointed these, that is a SureStep borrowed from Tony Robbins,

179
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:56.210
meaning you want to improve your physical state, your energy level,

180
00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.000
your state of arousal.

181
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.780
So to speak by doing a cold plunge, doing some jumping rope, whatever,

182
00:11:02.781 --> 00:11:05.600
before you create your story,

183
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.970
which will be enabling or disabling or somewhere in between.

184
00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.190
And before you then create your strategy for achieving a goal or problem

185
00:11:13.191 --> 00:11:13.880
solving.

186
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.580
Because if you're in a depressed state and this is something I've struggled

187
00:11:16.581 --> 00:11:20.840
with, you're going to create a disabling or a victim based story.

188
00:11:20.841 --> 00:11:24.050
And then your strategy is really going to be very narrow.

189
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:28.970
It's not going to be particularly oblique or useful in an unusual way.

190
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:33.530
If you have a heightened state and then you can translate that into an enabling

191
00:11:33.531 --> 00:11:35.300
optimistic story, your strategy will be better.

192
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:40.280
So I wrote that at the top of many of these particular entries,

193
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.760
blank entries before then getting to them in any case.

194
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:48.950
So first morning back Montreal was the day before this is

195
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:53.150
in 2017. I'm smiling at a friend of mine from Montreal.

196
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.260
I am grateful for, and again, this might seem cheesy, but for me,

197
00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:03.330
if I use certain types of note-taking for digesting information or

198
00:12:03.331 --> 00:12:06.750
brainstorming, finding insight, that is one type of note taking.

199
00:12:06.751 --> 00:12:11.070
I use morning pages for reducing nebulous, anxiety or worry.

200
00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:14.850
And I use the five minute journal for focus,

201
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.770
improving focus and execution and appreciation, which you'll see.

202
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.340
So I'm grateful for number one, bird song outside, beautiful number two,

203
00:12:23.341 --> 00:12:27.270
fireflies and stars last night. Number three, great stories,

204
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:32.130
great sauna times two before bed and rain outside to lulled to sleep.

205
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.460
So I will write down any number of things.

206
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:40.470
What has been a practice for me is choosing simple, basic things.

207
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:45.480
In other words, you could say my family, my loving family, and that's great,

208
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.760
but that is a big item.

209
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:52.350
And I have tried to cultivate and

210
00:12:52.351 --> 00:12:57.300
appreciation of the smaller things, which could be this book,

211
00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:59.670
the convenience of this notebook and the quality of the leather.

212
00:12:59.671 --> 00:13:03.270
It could be one of my favorite coffee mugs, which is this yellow coffee mug,

213
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:07.080
which has made many appearances in my five minute journal. And that trains you,

214
00:13:07.081 --> 00:13:11.880
I think, to notice the little things which ultimately translates to,

215
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:15.000
uh, of course noticing the big things, but not vice versa. All right.

216
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:18.870
What would make today? Great. This was in 2017,

217
00:13:18.871 --> 00:13:21.300
create Bob forms. All right.

218
00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:26.130
So Bob later became T O T, which was tools, Titans.

219
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:30.390
I believe that was Bob would have been,

220
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.010
I think so I think it was,

221
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:33.750
I think it was two of the times it might've been travel mentors,

222
00:13:33.751 --> 00:13:35.790
but I think it was tools of Titans. If we're looking at the dates,

223
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.370
look at TFS answers, Shep honor, their fruit Gordon.

224
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:43.830
So this is the second bullet, uh,

225
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:49.320
also tot spreadsheet. All right. So that's, uh, Amanda Palmer,

226
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:50.700
w I created,

227
00:13:50.701 --> 00:13:55.560
and my team helped me create different forms and spreadsheets for digesting

228
00:13:56.010 --> 00:14:00.930
the hundreds of hours of audio and transcripts that we have from

229
00:14:00.931 --> 00:14:04.800
the Tim Ferriss show podcast. Right? So create VOB forms,

230
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.570
look at TFS answers.

231
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:11.370
And then number three was email 20 new people to test the form.

232
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.370
And these would be forms that are either Google forms or roofer forms or

233
00:14:14.371 --> 00:14:18.450
something like that. That's it? What would make today? Great. That is it.

234
00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:23.610
I'm very prone to overestimate what I can do in a day and underestimating what I

235
00:14:23.611 --> 00:14:28.440
can do say in a year and the benefit of the five minute journal with

236
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.380
very little space and very few,

237
00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:36.030
two bulleted options is that you really need to be concise.

238
00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:36.930
You need to be succinct.

239
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:42.240
And that helps me to overcome some of my lesser tendencies. Uh,

240
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:46.800
next daily affirmation. I am forever forward am dash,

241
00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:48.360
no hurry, no pause, no hurry.

242
00:14:48.361 --> 00:14:53.300
No pause is an expression that was taught to me by a friend

243
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.790
former, uh, Navy seal,

244
00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.920
and also quite common in Buddhist circles

245
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.630
that I became very fond of.

246
00:15:02.631 --> 00:15:06.620
And I think that made it into tools of Titans and maybe into trouble mentors,

247
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.530
uh, daily affirmations. I am alright,

248
00:15:09.531 --> 00:15:11.750
second bullet good at this four times before.

249
00:15:11.751 --> 00:15:16.580
So just reassuring myself that I can actually complete books because whether you

250
00:15:16.581 --> 00:15:17.414
realize it or not,

251
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:22.400
I find writing extremely difficult and in paying with great

252
00:15:22.401 --> 00:15:25.820
concerns of insufficiency. Every time I tried to write a book,

253
00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.300
if that makes anyone feel better in the PM,

254
00:15:29.301 --> 00:15:31.370
review three amazing things that happened today.

255
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:36.260
I also always try to include at least one thing that is small Molly.

256
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:40.970
That's my dog healing while walking around a few different retail stores,

257
00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:45.350
very basic Molly used to have a tendency to pull on the leash sometimes still

258
00:15:45.351 --> 00:15:49.430
does. And she healed really well. Great. That's bullet number one, next bullet,

259
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.340
uh, per novel. So Naval Ravikant,

260
00:15:52.341 --> 00:15:56.390
who's a bit of an Oracle and incredibly gifted and very smart investor.

261
00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:00.110
He predicted that crypto was going to drop 30 to 40% and lo and behold,

262
00:16:00.111 --> 00:16:05.060
it did drop 30 to 40% and he called it exactly a number

263
00:16:05.061 --> 00:16:09.440
three, great late night call with a dear friend of mine. That's it?

264
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.500
Three amazing things that happened today. Boom, those are three.

265
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:15.410
So I guess late night calls probably the night before that's okay.

266
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.890
Sometimes I may catch up and then last but not least,

267
00:16:18.891 --> 00:16:20.630
how could I've made today better?

268
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.740
So this was late June, 2017.

269
00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.640
And it's good for me to see this because I need the reminder,

270
00:16:28.641 --> 00:16:32.300
even though I've been quite good at titrating back, number one,

271
00:16:32.301 --> 00:16:36.410
don't use Kito as an excuse to drink 15 liters of coffee.

272
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:39.500
Uh, that's the ketogenic diet.

273
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:44.090
And if I'm using a low calorie keto diet to transition into fasting,

274
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:49.250
sometimes I compensate for that during the very awkward kind of

275
00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.870
gray transition period of keto flu to drink copious amounts of coffee,

276
00:16:53.871 --> 00:16:56.120
which always backfires and has negative side effects.

277
00:16:56.121 --> 00:16:58.790
So don't use keto as an excuse to drink 15 liters of coffee.

278
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.280
I wasn't literally drinking 15 liters.

279
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:05.930
If those on the internet are taking that literally next drink, less coffee,

280
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.530
comma, use caffeine pills if needed. All right.

281
00:17:09.531 --> 00:17:13.640
So coffee is a really interesting substance and has effects on

282
00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.760
the ability to conceive pregnancy and so on.

283
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:20.810
That seems to apply even if it's decaf as an example.

284
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:23.870
So this was a period when I was very,

285
00:17:23.871 --> 00:17:28.820
very tightly wound on high doses of caffeine and wanted to make an effort to

286
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.590
decrease my coffee consumption.

287
00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.890
And when you use the five minute journal consistently,

288
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:37.790
what I will do then is say every quarter, go back and look for patterns.

289
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.590
And two of the patterns that I noticed were,

290
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.140
what could I do to make tomorrow better?

291
00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:47.390
The two most common answers were drink, less coffee and wake up earlier.

292
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.440
Those were the two.

293
00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:53.310
So I made concerted effort with accountability to do

294
00:17:53.311 --> 00:17:55.950
both of those things. And that is the five minute journal.

295
00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:00.960
So we have brainstorm insight, note-taking review, right?

296
00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:04.890
For answers, problem solving, interesting goals. And so on.

297
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.750
We've got the,

298
00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:10.890
the morning pages which I can do here or in the morning pages workbook for

299
00:18:10.891 --> 00:18:13.830
reducing anxiety or worries, neuroses, whatever it might be.

300
00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:18.690
And then the five minute journal, which is very helpful for both focus,

301
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.180
keeping things simple and appreciation.

302
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.540
So you don't have to do all three of these every day. I certainly don't.

303
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.070
I use them as needed,

304
00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.120
but when I do even one of these consistently,

305
00:18:30.121 --> 00:18:33.060
I see a dramatic difference and not just my quality of life,

306
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.670
but focus and ability to execute consistently.

307
00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:40.410
So hopefully that helps at least one ear out there. And thanks for watching.
