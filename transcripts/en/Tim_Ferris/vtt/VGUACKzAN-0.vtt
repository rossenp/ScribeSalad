<v 0>Optimal at this altitude,</v>

2
00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:06.840
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking familiar.

3
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.460
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

4
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.501
<v 1>Books.</v>

5
00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:28.940
I've loved on the Tim Ferriss show is exclusively brought to you by audible.

6
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.010
There couldn't be a better sponsor for this series.

7
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:35.000
My dear listeners and readers I've used audible for so many years,

8
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.890
as long as I can remember. I love it.

9
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.070
Audible has the largest selection of audio books on the planet.

10
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.580
I listen when I'm taking walks. I listen while I'm cooking.

11
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.180
I listen whenever I can. And if you're looking for a place to start,

12
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.730
I can recommend three of my favorites.

13
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.170
The first is the Tao of Seneca by Seneca.

14
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.640
If you want to hear my favorite letters of all time touches on stoic philosophy,

15
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.130
calmness under duress, et cetera.

16
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.300
The next is the graveyard book by Neil Gaiman,

17
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.480
G a I M a N one of my favorites,

18
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.610
even if you're a nonfiction purist,

19
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.340
this is the fiction book that you need to listen to.

20
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.200
Neo also has perhaps the most calming voice of all time and third,

21
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.530
Greg McKeown's essential ism subtitle.

22
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.390
The disciplined pursuit of less.

23
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.500
This is one of my favorite books of the past few years combines very well with

24
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:31.040
the 80 20 principle, but more on audible every month.

25
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.830
Audible members get one credit for any audio book on the site,

26
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.240
plus a choice of multiple audible originals from a rotating selection.

27
00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:41.870
They also get access to daily news digests from the likes of the New York times

28
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:45.410
wall street journal and the Washington post as well as guided meditation

29
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:48.800
programs. And here are some other amazing audible features.

30
00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:52.580
And I use a bunch of these. You can download titles and listen offline anytime,

31
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.280
anywhere I use this feature,

32
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.660
even when I could get access, I'll put my phone on say airplane mode,

33
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.760
because I don't want to get bothered with notifications.

34
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.930
And I'm taking a walk to clear my head and you can listen to titles offline in a

35
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:07.760
case like that or on a plane or whatever.

36
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.290
Obviously I'm not flying much these days.

37
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.760
The app is free and can be installed on all smartphones and tablets.

38
00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:16.520
You can listen across devices without losing your spot.

39
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.690
And whisper sync is another feature I use quite a lot.

40
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.820
I love reading my Kindle in bed. For instance,

41
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.810
then picking up at the same exact spot where I left off.

42
00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:28.520
When I go walking and listening to the next day,

43
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.720
Kindle and audio versions can be sinked up automatically. It's just amazing.

44
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.750
And if you can't decide what to listen to, don't sweat it.

45
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:36.584
You don't have to rush.

46
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.130
You can keep your credits for up to a year and use them for instance,

47
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:43.820
to binge on a whole series. If you like audible offers just about everything.

<v 2>Hello.</v>

62
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.720
<v 1>Boys and girls, ladies and germs. This is Tim Ferriss.</v>

63
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.730
Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show,

64
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.270
where it is usually my job to sit down with world-class performers of all

65
00:03:42.271 --> 00:03:46.320
different types, startup founders, investors, chess champions, Olympic athletes,

66
00:03:46.321 --> 00:03:49.860
you name it to tease out that habits that you can apply in your own lives.

67
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.450
This episode, however,

68
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.040
is an experiment and part of a short form series that I'm doing simply

69
00:03:56.041 --> 00:04:00.660
called books. I've loved. I've invited some amazing past guests,

70
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.930
close friends and new faces to share their favorite books.

71
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.480
Describe their favorite books. The books that have influenced them,

72
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.850
changed them, transform them for the better.

73
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.830
And I hope you pick up one or two new mentors in the form of books from this new

74
00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:16.020
series and apply the lessons in your own life.

75
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.200
I had a lot of fun putting this together,

76
00:04:19.201 --> 00:04:23.820
inviting these people to participate and have learned so, so much myself.

77
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.850
I hope that is also the case for you. Please enjoy.

78
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.691
<v 2>Thanks, Tim,</v>

79
00:04:30.691 --> 00:04:34.200
for having me back to talk about some of my favorite books and I wanted to do

80
00:04:34.201 --> 00:04:35.220
something different today,

81
00:04:35.221 --> 00:04:39.390
which is I wanted to recommend some books that I've never recommended before on

82
00:04:39.391 --> 00:04:40.290
this podcast.

83
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.310
And that I haven't heard other people recommending things that people may not

84
00:04:44.311 --> 00:04:44.761
know about.

85
00:04:44.761 --> 00:04:48.360
I want to turn people onto some new staff that's like so central to me.

86
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.040
So my criteria were,

87
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.190
what are the books where I've underlined the most amount of things,

88
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.990
some of these books that I'm going to recommend,

89
00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.000
I literally have underlining or marks on every single page that I have a

90
00:05:00.001 --> 00:05:02.400
kind of involved system. I use to Mark up books,

91
00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:06.030
depending on the residents of the idea and different things going on in the

92
00:05:06.031 --> 00:05:08.580
book. The second thing is brought together.

93
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.260
These books sort of encompass like the

94
00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:16.020
body of what I think right now,

95
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:20.250
the kinds of things that I write about and post on Instagram and teach and

96
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.640
coach, and have had so much value in my life and change them.

97
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.830
And I'm going to walk you into them for,

98
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.780
let's say the simplest book to the most complex from one

99
00:05:30.781 --> 00:05:35.640
that's just so easy to read to one, that's almost like a textbook.

100
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.960
So if you're into these, start at the beginning and see how far along you get.

101
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.280
I love all of these,

102
00:05:41.281 --> 00:05:46.140
and they're really great on the path to understanding yourself and who you

103
00:05:46.141 --> 00:05:50.190
are and the obstacles that get in your way and where you

104
00:05:50.191 --> 00:05:54.870
self-sabotage and your relationships, and ultimately real freedom.

105
00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.230
The first author, Cheri Huber. And I wanted to tell you about her past,

106
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:02.270
but I looked it up online and I can't find anything there.

107
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:04.670
So I don't know if it's public, but as a child,

108
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.590
Sherry probably faced one of the worst traumas a young person can

109
00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:13.190
ever go through and she not only survived it.

110
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.530
She became a Buddhist monk and of all the people I've ever met in

111
00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:23.480
my life. I think she's one of the most centered, wise,

112
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.270
powerful presences I've ever been around.

113
00:06:26.271 --> 00:06:30.050
There's just something about her that I can, my, I would like to get to one day.

114
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:33.920
I really would. She writes tons of books. I'd love to read every one.

115
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.230
And her books are very simply written. There's just distilled to pure wisdom.

116
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.380
Almost like a wise mentor is giving you the advice there.

117
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:47.300
Aren't like supporting arguments and footnotes and research studies is

118
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:49.640
just like the wisdom from high on the mountain.

119
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.360
It's also written a unique font where part of the story and the power and the

120
00:06:53.361 --> 00:06:57.410
impact of the words is done through the font and style of writing,

121
00:06:57.411 --> 00:07:01.160
changing as well as the illustrations by June Shriver,

122
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.310
or it could be shiver the illustrator in the book.

123
00:07:04.311 --> 00:07:07.640
So really look through all our books and read anything.

124
00:07:07.641 --> 00:07:11.000
But I'll share with you the two that have had the biggest impact on me.

125
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.120
Actually, the only two I've read, I would do want to read the rest,

126
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.760
but I started with the fear book and fear book is so powerful because so many of

127
00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:24.080
us have a certain area where fear and doubt

128
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:27.230
and uncertainty get in our way.

129
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.540
And the book walks you through the idea of, of,

130
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:35.420
of how to embrace them and move beyond them.

131
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.380
And often it's very counter-intuitive, but so true.

132
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.440
I highly recommend this for dealing with it and want to go read you one quote

133
00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:44.450
from it. I'm going to read a couple of quotes from it.

134
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.420
And her basic idea is that moving toward your fears and getting past them is the

135
00:07:50.421 --> 00:07:54.650
path to freedom. And I love this part in her books, by the way,

136
00:07:54.651 --> 00:07:58.520
are very short, 150 pages at most. She writes,

137
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.780
if you no longer believe what fear tells you, you will live.

138
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:04.160
And it will not.

139
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:09.050
That is a point on the spiritual journey that almost nobody gets past when that

140
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:10.280
terrorizes,

141
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.870
when it gets backed into a corner and some matter of its survival or yours,

142
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:19.670
almost nobody has the required combination of courage, desperation,

143
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:21.860
willingness to stand up to it.

144
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.690
When this force in you that is controlled and motivated you all your life is

145
00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:29.150
screaming. If you do that, you're going to die.

146
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.980
Very few people are going to say, well, I just need to find out if that is true.

147
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:35.480
Or if that is so she writes,

148
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:39.740
that's why it's so important to remember that projection is going on.

149
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:42.230
What's being screamed on a paraphrase a little too.

150
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:46.580
So it kind of sinks in what's really being screamed here is if you stay with

151
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:48.530
this fear, I will die.

152
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:53.810
The fear the Eagle will die and that's true. It will die.

153
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.170
It's life is your death. It's death is your life.

154
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:00.231
So good.

155
00:09:00.231 --> 00:09:03.830
It's really about letting go of the stuff that holds you back that you're so

156
00:09:03.831 --> 00:09:08.300
attached to and just isn't serving you and is keeping you from being free and

157
00:09:08.301 --> 00:09:09.560
keeping it from being yourself.

158
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.760
And here's one last little bit from the book you can do right now, now, so good.

159
00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.510
Do something you fear not to conquer the fear,

160
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:22.100
not to accomplish a task, but to familiarize yourself with the process,

161
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:27.170
with which fear protects itself to demystify it. And I love this.

162
00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:31.370
I've said in this podcast before become a scientist of your own lows and this

163
00:09:31.371 --> 00:09:33.530
the same become a scientist of fear. It's,

164
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.380
it's almost like I call it false survival mode.

165
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.870
There's so many things that we think are survival threats,

166
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.290
and we treat them like survival threats and we go start fighting like our life

167
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:47.450
in danger when it isn't. So it's a great demystifying empowering book.

168
00:09:47.451 --> 00:09:49.850
It's called the fear book. The other book of Sherry hubris,

169
00:09:49.851 --> 00:09:51.200
I recommended I'm pulling it out now,

170
00:09:51.201 --> 00:09:55.970
as we speak is be the person you want to find relationship and self discovery.

171
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:57.380
And the title kind of says it all.

172
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:03.350
And I love this book because it's actually my philosophy on relationships,

173
00:10:03.351 --> 00:10:07.340
which is if you want to meet a better person, then become a better person.

174
00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:12.290
And this is like this beautiful book that really elegantly sort of

175
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:16.670
weans us away from these crazy relationship myths we have and these expectations

176
00:10:16.671 --> 00:10:19.730
of other partners. And it begins by really boldly saying,

177
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:24.590
there's this book is about you taking 100% responsibility for yourself

178
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.080
all the time. And, uh,

179
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.620
and I really think of everybody can read this book and really live by it.

180
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.830
Things would go so much better if it's about things that we're going to get into

181
00:10:33.831 --> 00:10:36.920
later and with the next set of books, about how much, uh,

182
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.430
of our childhood sort of stories,

183
00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:42.710
we ended up playing out on our partner. And then again,

184
00:10:42.711 --> 00:10:45.140
I'm just gonna read one part, then we'll move on. I mean,

185
00:10:45.141 --> 00:10:47.240
this book is so good that instead of underlining lines,

186
00:10:47.241 --> 00:10:50.300
I've literally like marked entire pages. So these are two of the pages.

187
00:10:50.301 --> 00:10:54.530
And again, it flies by it's a short book, the sad, strange,

188
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:58.550
unfortunate, dysfunctional part of life, by the way.

189
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.190
So I'm going to read this part. I'm going to paraphrase a couple of bits,

190
00:11:01.191 --> 00:11:05.840
just so it makes sense out of context, the sad, strange, unfortunate,

191
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:10.070
dysfunctional part of life is that as adults, most of us,

192
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.170
I was still trying to survive childhood.

193
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.350
So I have become the person I believed as a child.

194
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:20.570
I needed to become in order to make it through adulthood, diamond adult,

195
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:24.320
and an intimate relationship. And I'm suffering. This is traumatic.

196
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:28.790
I have picked consciously or not someone who's going to relive parts of my

197
00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:31.640
childhood with me. He's going to play the parts opposite me.

198
00:11:31.641 --> 00:11:32.900
Someone else did back then.

199
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.750
I'm going to suffer in the same way I did as a child.

200
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:40.820
And I'm going to use the same survival mechanisms and right

201
00:11:40.821 --> 00:11:42.170
there is literally,

202
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.320
it doesn't matter what recurring problem we're having a relationship.

203
00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.730
That is the reason why, and this book gets you past them. I love it.

204
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:54.670
Highly recommended next author. So we're going to move sort of one level up on,

205
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.000
I don't want to say like difficult to read or advancement of concepts,

206
00:11:58.001 --> 00:12:01.570
but also very, very accessible books, thereby Pia Mellody,

207
00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:05.920
I'm going to recommend two books and we'll start with facing co-dependence and

208
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.610
co-dependence is a word that's used a lot, but really rarely understood.

209
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.490
And this book isn't just about relationships for me,

210
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.770
what it is is it presents a model of trauma.

211
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:19.420
That to me has been key to understanding my life and to helping

212
00:12:19.421 --> 00:12:22.030
others and is really life-changing. And here's,

213
00:12:22.031 --> 00:12:26.440
what's fascinating about PML study. She doesn't do Ted talks,

214
00:12:26.441 --> 00:12:29.830
at least as far as I know, she doesn't have a big social media presence.

215
00:12:29.831 --> 00:12:33.370
If one at all, she doesn't even have a Wikipedia entry. She was,

216
00:12:33.371 --> 00:12:38.260
I believe a nurse at a inpatient sort of rehab facility called the Meadows and

217
00:12:38.261 --> 00:12:42.010
started to develop her own system based on a number of different therapies and

218
00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.400
tools. And it's really powerful if I was to say, Hey,

219
00:12:45.401 --> 00:12:49.900
if you really want to change what a modality, even though I hate that word,

220
00:12:49.901 --> 00:12:52.810
what modalities should do? Should you follow, I'd say,

221
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.390
check into PML studies work, uh,

222
00:12:55.391 --> 00:12:59.560
what's called pit post induction therapy. I think that's what it's called,

223
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:00.453
what it stands for,

224
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:04.210
but her whole idea is your childhood is a hypnotic induction.

225
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:06.280
You're being sort of indoctrinated.

226
00:13:06.281 --> 00:13:11.230
It's like a cult and you're then to be unbrainwashing and hypnotized

227
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.330
is start living your true and free life.

228
00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:18.010
Let an elegant idea the great part about facing co-dependence besides his

229
00:13:18.011 --> 00:13:21.610
exploration of what codependency is, why it happens, how it happens, uh,

230
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.680
the signs, the patterns,

231
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.920
there's also a breakdown in the end of how she defines trauma.

232
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.113
And it's a way to sort of,

233
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.990
self-diagnose a trauma and I'm just going to check out the contents right here.

234
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.200
To me as a new parent is also a parenting book.

235
00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.340
She talks about the nature of a child, how a child has these rights.

236
00:13:39.341 --> 00:13:42.550
And I've thought about it with my child, has I've raised him to be spontaneous,

237
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.020
to be protected, to be. And I love this line perfectly imperfect.

238
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:49.540
In other words, some parents expect their child to be perfect.

239
00:13:49.541 --> 00:13:52.660
And that's sort of a form of trauma when they're not allowed to make mistakes or

240
00:13:52.661 --> 00:13:55.870
learn from their mistakes or do things that are sort of age appropriate.

241
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:58.150
And then she talks about abuse, generational abuse,

242
00:13:58.151 --> 00:14:01.270
and then breaks down trauma to these different categories of physical abuse,

243
00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:04.750
sexual abuse, emotional abuse, intellectual abuse, spiritual abuse.

244
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.920
And the main thing about these is it sounds obvious when you read it,

245
00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.820
she defines abuse as anytime a child has a dependency need. That's not met.

246
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.150
That creates abuse. So a quick example of spiritual abuse,

247
00:14:16.151 --> 00:14:21.130
I see many with it is when a parent has to always be right.

248
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:25.120
The parents always right. They can never be wrong. They can never be corrected.

249
00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:30.100
And she sees that as a form of spiritual abuse because the parents blame

250
00:14:30.101 --> 00:14:33.460
God, the parent becomes the child's higher power and it creates such a deep

251
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.330
insecurity on the part of the child in terms of their reality. In fact,

252
00:14:37.331 --> 00:14:41.170
I find these people often resistant to work with because they feel like to say

253
00:14:41.171 --> 00:14:46.000
anything negative about their parent is like blaspheming. God, it's fascinating.

254
00:14:46.001 --> 00:14:48.460
So I highly recommend it the second book to read next,

255
00:14:48.461 --> 00:14:51.620
and this one is more about relationships, but I love it.

256
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.340
Definitely something that's put a lot of value in my life in terms of breaking

257
00:14:55.341 --> 00:14:57.830
some patterns is called facing love addiction.

258
00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.780
And it's really about the love addict and the love avoidance.

259
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.030
And this is probably like probably 75% of relationships to some degree.

260
00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:09.590
I'm just throwing that out ballpark.

261
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:14.750
But what happens is one person in a relationship is more needy and one

262
00:15:14.751 --> 00:15:19.550
person is a more resentful and,

263
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.571
uh, it doesn't begin that way.

264
00:15:20.571 --> 00:15:24.380
It begins in this flowering of love and projection.

265
00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:29.090
And then eventually this pattern plays out where one person needs more.

266
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.760
The other person wants to give less and less.

267
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:34.040
The other person gives the more the other person needs.

268
00:15:34.041 --> 00:15:37.400
And there's this neediness resentment pattern that eventually plays out and

269
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.650
blows up in negative ways. Often,

270
00:15:39.651 --> 00:15:42.890
sometimes when I know people who have been their partners,

271
00:15:42.891 --> 00:15:45.830
but having a fare for a long time and they never saw it,

272
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:47.780
they're often in a haze of love addiction,

273
00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:51.050
where they're holding onto this fantasy. It's a powerful book.

274
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.940
I love these both really read these multiple times and you'll have

275
00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:00.650
an understanding of the matrix of how relationships work as PML,

276
00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:03.140
body facing co-dependence and facing levitation.

277
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.500
So the next book is not for everyone,

278
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.630
but it's for a certain percentage of people here I'm among it's a target

279
00:16:11.631 --> 00:16:14.420
audience. And I didn't think I was a monster target audience.

280
00:16:14.421 --> 00:16:18.410
When I first heard about it as called silently seduced is by

281
00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:23.090
Kenneth Adams. And it's related to the PML Eddie books. I mentioned earlier.

282
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.540
And specifically for those who've experienced in measurement and measurement is

283
00:16:26.541 --> 00:16:29.210
not a word that's often used. So I'm going to explain it super quickly.

284
00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.020
It's the opposite of abandonment. So abandonment, as we all know,

285
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:36.050
is a parent is somehow not meeting a child's needs, whether emotional,

286
00:16:36.051 --> 00:16:38.660
physical protection being absent,

287
00:16:38.661 --> 00:16:43.430
whatever it may be in measurement is when a child is meeting a

288
00:16:43.431 --> 00:16:45.530
parent's needs. And,

289
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:49.700
and we don't talk about it because abandonment is disempowering.

290
00:16:49.701 --> 00:16:51.770
You feel disempowered, helpless, vulnerable,

291
00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:56.180
no one there in measurement is falsely empowering. You feel as a child,

292
00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:58.880
like you have power because you're there for your parents,

293
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:03.670
a parent who lives for a child who needs the child's accomplishments to make up

294
00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.810
their own accomplishments, who has apparent with tons of anxiety,

295
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:12.320
needs to over-control the child, a parent who's lonely, or has a bad marriage,

296
00:17:12.321 --> 00:17:16.190
or is going through a divorce and is using the child for their own narcissistic

297
00:17:16.191 --> 00:17:18.770
reasons or to get back at the parent or just because they have,

298
00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:19.903
nobody has talked to,

299
00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.090
there are so many ways that a measurement works and here's a,

300
00:17:23.091 --> 00:17:25.250
here's a little rule of thumb that abandonment,

301
00:17:25.251 --> 00:17:29.360
you feel bad about yourself with inmeshment it's only when you feel sorry for

302
00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:30.800
the parent. So if you ever,

303
00:17:30.801 --> 00:17:32.990
there's a moment where he felt sad or sorry for your parent,

304
00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:35.000
that probably was a measurement going on.

305
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:40.340
I remember interviewing Jay Leno and talking about comedy and he became a

306
00:17:40.341 --> 00:17:44.180
comedian because his mom was depressed and he was always trying to cheer her up.

307
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.980
That's a measurement and silently seduced deals with a form of enmeshment that

308
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:53.570
they call shockingly emotional incest. I remember when I booked the truth,

309
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:57.050
came out, actually wrote an editorial for New York times on emotional incest.

310
00:17:57.051 --> 00:18:00.740
And it wasn't printed. That's such a shocking term.

311
00:18:00.741 --> 00:18:03.290
It shocked me when it was used to diagnose me.

312
00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:06.770
But what it is is it's when a child is used not sexually by the parent,

313
00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:10.760
when a child used emotionally by the parent becomes an emotional partner to

314
00:18:10.761 --> 00:18:12.440
them. And often it's a parent,

315
00:18:12.441 --> 00:18:15.800
who's in a troubled relationship who makes the child, their emotional partner.

316
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.110
As my mom, 100% did with me.

317
00:18:18.111 --> 00:18:20.690
She'd sit there in my room and talk to him about my father.

318
00:18:20.691 --> 00:18:21.860
And I remember she actually said,

319
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:26.180
Neil never grew up to make anyone as miserable as your father makes me,

320
00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:31.460
which really, really, uh, uh, messed up my relationships for awhile.

321
00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.680
I felt like somebody was sad or wasn't, wasn't happy.

322
00:18:33.681 --> 00:18:35.810
I would just sort of end the relationship.

323
00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.930
So what happens with people who are in meshed is they want love.

324
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.100
They want relationships.

325
00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.340
Then they get in a relationship and they feel suffocated.

326
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:48.110
They feel trapped and they sabotage it or want to get out of it. Somehow,

327
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:51.320
this is crazy intimacy attraction than avoidance pattern usually.

328
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.350
And it's a great book about it. It walks you through,

329
00:18:54.351 --> 00:18:57.620
it explains the cases and it gives you steps to break the pattern.

330
00:18:57.621 --> 00:19:00.710
So highly recommended silently seduced by Kenneth Adams.

331
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:04.430
If this is appropriate to you or 70 data in the past two or someone you care

332
00:19:04.431 --> 00:19:07.970
about, it's a good gift. I'd definitely given at least a hundred of these away.

333
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.040
I love this next author. I'm just going to start with this.

334
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:16.280
He meaning the type of man he's talking about will believe that his

335
00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:21.200
masculinity is proved by betting women driving a high powered car or making

336
00:19:21.201 --> 00:19:24.110
lots of money underneath. He knows the truth, of course,

337
00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:26.420
and he is desperately afraid of being found out.

338
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.740
He believes himself an impostor in the company of men.

339
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:33.590
And in this era, in our society,

340
00:19:33.591 --> 00:19:37.670
when we're trying to sort of look at the roles,

341
00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:41.690
men play at a mass, they were to have a sort of better, healthier society.

342
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.280
I highly recommend this book.

343
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.220
It's another one that I've given this at this point,

344
00:19:46.221 --> 00:19:48.890
probably like more than a hundred copies away, uh,

345
00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:53.750
it's called under and shadow the wounding and healing of men by James Hollis

346
00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:58.520
and Jamie Hollis is a youngian psychoanalyst. It amazing author.

347
00:19:58.550 --> 00:19:59.930
I actually loved his books so much.

348
00:19:59.931 --> 00:20:02.630
I hadn't been my therapist for awhile and was literally like taking a college

349
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:06.230
class. It's so good. It's not the easiest book to make it through,

350
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:11.330
but it's so dense with meaning with historical example, with amazing quotes.

351
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:13.310
And it really looks at a deep mythical,

352
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:18.350
psychological level of the struggles that the modern sort of man faces and

353
00:20:18.351 --> 00:20:20.270
attempts to put a framework around it.

354
00:20:20.271 --> 00:20:23.630
That's so wonderfully full of wisdom.

355
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:27.830
And I really don't see the sort of addressed a lot in a, in a helpful,

356
00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.190
useful non-shared gaming, uh,

357
00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:34.280
self understanding ending way. I was looking for another quote,

358
00:20:34.281 --> 00:20:37.040
but I stumbled across this. I literally have something underlined on every page.

359
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:41.600
What father can not access in himself can not be passed onto his son.

360
00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:45.470
Such a good to think about it for the parents out there like myself. So good.

361
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.680
I'm going to read a little part. I'm literally just turning a random page.

362
00:20:47.681 --> 00:20:50.320
There's so much in here. It's just worth it. We're hearing all the time.

363
00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.450
He writes as Joseph Campbell expressed it.

364
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:57.370
One can spend one's whole life climbing the ladder only to realize that it's

365
00:20:57.371 --> 00:21:01.360
been placed against the wrong wall for men to begin the process of healing.

366
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.760
They must first risk being honest with themselves,

367
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.340
along the feelings they think they can't afford.

368
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.730
They must admit they're not happy in spite of what they've achieved.

369
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.400
They must admit they do not know who they are,

370
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.020
what they must do to save themselves.

371
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:17.800
They must overcome the fear that blocks such thinking the fear that they will

372
00:21:17.801 --> 00:21:22.210
have to change their lives. If the emotional cat is let out of the bag.

373
00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:26.560
And ultimately it's a book about set of self-examination and making sure you're

374
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:28.570
not just running on these preset tracks,

375
00:21:28.571 --> 00:21:32.890
that the culture has given you and really living out what's important to you,

376
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.980
or as Hala says it. And we'll end the description of the book with this.

377
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.790
The crux of the middle passage is the requirements that a man,

378
00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:44.320
whatever his age or station pull out of his reflexive behaviors and attitudes

379
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:45.543
radically,

380
00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:50.590
re-examine his life at risk living out the thunderous imperatives of his soul.

381
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:55.090
So good, highly recommended. So what did James Hollis has?

382
00:21:55.091 --> 00:21:59.080
Central ideas is we have these two that we have these two fantastic quest we go

383
00:21:59.081 --> 00:22:02.230
on in our lives. One is the fantasy day mortality,

384
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.660
and the other one is a fantasy of the magical other.

385
00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:07.360
And the latter is the heart of his other book that I love,

386
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.960
which is the Eden project. And let me get the subtitle here,

387
00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:15.310
the Eden project in search of a magical other, uh,

388
00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.250
kind of like the Cheri Huber book. He just cuts to the core of it.

389
00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.500
I'm going to look right now with one of my favorite quotes from it.

390
00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.050
It's so good. It's so good.

391
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:28.270
Being in an intimate relationship is a bit like asking someone to join hands

392
00:22:28.271 --> 00:22:33.130
with us, but only after walking across a field in which we have planted minds

393
00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:37.420
and another great quote. And I think this just captures the book he writes.

394
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:42.490
The best thing we can do for our relationships with others is to render our

395
00:22:42.491 --> 00:22:44.920
relationship to ourselves more conscious.

396
00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:48.550
This is not a narcissistic activity. In fact,

397
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.700
it will prove to be the most loving thing we can do for the other.

398
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.450
The greatest gift to others is our own best selves.

399
00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.950
That's paradoxically. If we are to serve relationship well,

400
00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:05.110
we are obliged to affirm our individual journey. It's so good.

401
00:23:05.111 --> 00:23:07.510
And yes, it's just like the wisdom, the Sherry humor book.

402
00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:08.920
I want to love about all these books,

403
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:13.960
whether it's sort of PML coming from inpatient addiction rehab,

404
00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:18.610
or it's James Hollis coming from young or Cheri

405
00:23:18.611 --> 00:23:23.350
Huber coming from Buddhism. It's the exact same wisdom.

406
00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:26.290
So if you read all these books, if you put them all together,

407
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.110
they're all telling the same thing. So go do it.

408
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.110
<v 3>Hey guys, this is Tim again, just a few more things before you take off.</v>

409
00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:36.990
Number one, this is five bullet Friday.

410
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:40.310
Do you want to get a short email from me?

411
00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:44.490
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

412
00:23:44.491 --> 00:23:48.470
little more of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very short

413
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:53.000
email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been pondering

414
00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:53.863
over the week.

415
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.350
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered it could include

416
00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:02.380
gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird that I've somehow dug up in the, uh,

417
00:24:02.381 --> 00:24:04.460
the world of the esoteric as I do.

418
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:09.590
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared

419
00:24:09.591 --> 00:24:13.100
with my close friends, for instance. And it's very short.

420
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:18.140
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

421
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.390
