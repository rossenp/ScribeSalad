00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.063
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.740
<v 1>I want to talk about positivity or hear you talk about positivity.</v>

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.770
Because for instance, I was,

4
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.120
I was reading a piece in variety that seemed to me to indicate that you are a

5
00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:21.230
master of managing energy and avoiding energy leaks.

6
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.660
And, uh, for instance,

7
00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:28.280
the decision to allow your children to get to know your, uh, their grandfather,

8
00:00:28.281 --> 00:00:29.114
your father,

9
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.720
the quote that stuck out to me was it takes too much time and energy to keep

10
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.330
hate alive. And for those people who don't know, I mean,

11
00:00:35.331 --> 00:00:37.340
your father was an addict. You ha you've,

12
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.080
you've spoken about him publicly before a contentious relationship. Uh,

13
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.000
how have you developed that positivity? Was that, uh, mostly from your mom?

14
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.770
Uh, how do you think about that.

15
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.950
<v 2>When you, when you come from the bomb and you work your way</v>

16
00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.290
up to when you work your way up to the place that some people refer to as the

17
00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:05.180
top, I mean, what, what do I have to be angry about?

18
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.910
What do I have to really and complain about

19
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.480
and Harper, you know what I mean? Like, I, I,

20
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.910
I really do come from none of them. I'm a,

21
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.170
I'm a part of a very small percentage. So,

22
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.990
and understanding that and knowing that the things that are supposed to

23
00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:33.500
act as triggers to things that are supposed to be

24
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.590
life-changing threatening, you know, altering, um,

25
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.700
are just lessons. It's just education.

26
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.350
It's it's stories for lack of a better word. You know,

27
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.410
you got an amazing story under your belt,

28
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.360
and I don't choose to stay in

29
00:01:56.361 --> 00:02:00.890
one particular paragraph, uh,

30
00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:04.640
of my story. It's a long story. And you know,

31
00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:07.130
the life is as long as of course,

32
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.440
we are all given the chance for it to be, uh,

33
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.030
because that's something that we have no control.

34
00:02:14.031 --> 00:02:18.950
We only tried to enhance the opportunity of longevity

35
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.080
or success. We don't have no control,

36
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.020
you walk outside and something could happen. Boom. And that's it.

37
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.970
So I just have a realistic approach and understanding to

38
00:02:28.971 --> 00:02:33.830
that, I've come from nothing. I got something I'm appreciative of my,

39
00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:38.390
something. I don't look at this something as if I'm supposed to have it,

40
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.560
because that's not how it works. I'm very fortunate and blessed to,

41
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.840
it could all go away if it did. And I had to start all over again.

42
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.200
That's life. I don't harp on it.

43
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.300
I don't and complain about the things that I can't change and the things that

44
00:02:56.301 --> 00:03:00.760
you can change. Why spend if you're going to change it.

45
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.110
Yeah. You know what I mean? So when you, when you look at, for example,

46
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:08.410
relationship, uh, with me and my father,

47
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.510
did my father up. Yeah. Uh,

48
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.030
my father get himself clean and straight. Yeah.

49
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.590
As my father feel bad about some of the stuff that he did. Yeah.

50
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.620
Could you still be angry at the lack of parenting that was done or the

51
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:31.300
time that was spent? Yeah. But why it doesn't,

52
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:32.500
it doesn't change. It,

53
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.810
it doesn't change anything that happened. It doesn't,

54
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.550
it doesn't make it right. You know what I mean?

55
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:45.010
Like you don't that, that anger that you're,

56
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.660
that you're giving off into that is not going to change these things.

57
00:03:49.661 --> 00:03:54.220
So that's energy that I feel like I can put into something

58
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.000
else.

59
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.830
That's energy that I feel like I can get a lot more use out of

60
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:03.310
that energy. That would have been negative. I'll find a way to say,

61
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:07.570
you know what I do forgive you. And I mean that and that life now,

62
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.140
hopefully it's better for us if it's not, I know that it's not because of me.

63
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.870
I don't like putting myself in a position to easily be affected. You know,

64
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.530
I think life is too short. It's too short.

65
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.320
And if you just spend time being affected all the time,

66
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.330
those are tough days, man. If you're bothered all the time,

67
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.400
there's a lot of to be bothered about the day. You can be bothered a lot of.

68
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.710
If you're the person that's really bothered, then how,

69
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.270
how pleasant are you to be around?

70
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.670
If there's just so much anger and so much

71
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.230
negative energy,

72
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.150
I just choose the opposite direct and approach. And I mean,

73
00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.490
that doesn't make me perfect. I'm nowhere near perfect. I done up.

74
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:05.290
I don't do stupid and I've apologized and VAT can be,

75
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.420
uh, you know, those apologies can be accepted then. Great. It's fantastic.

76
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.820
If they can't, why can't do anything about that?

77
00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:17.320
I can't put any more energy into the things that I've tried to do or make right.

78
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.410
If you choose to still feel a certain way, God bless you.

79
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.200
I'm going to keep living. That's my attitude.
