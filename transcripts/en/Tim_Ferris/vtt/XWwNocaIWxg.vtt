00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.130
<v 0>Can I take a question from one of the private Facebook groups where I do various</v>

2
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:05.910
experiments.

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.170
And this question is from Christian B while reading and living

4
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:11.250
stoicism,

5
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.610
how do you avoid spending too much time thinking about the inevitability of

6
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:18.690
death and how do you harness it to empower you rather than scare or overwhelm

7
00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:21.930
you? So let's begin with a definition of terms,

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.110
stoicism or stoic philosophy, very simply.

9
00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:28.830
And this is going to be simplified for any academics out there who want to poke

10
00:00:28.831 --> 00:00:33.660
holes in it is a philosophical system that

11
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.890
focuses on separating the things you can control from the things you cannot

12
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:41.730
control and then instills in your daily practice

13
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.560
habits and exercises such that you can focus

14
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.890
as much of your energy as possible on things you can control.

15
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.020
Part of stoicism is meditating on

16
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.883
death,

17
00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.930
certain inevitabilities and finding freedom in that instead

18
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.400
of overwhelmed. All right, that sounds very nice and theoretical and conceptual.

19
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.750
What does that mean in practice?

20
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.660
I spend an amount of time that might seem ridiculous

21
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.110
reminding myself of death, and this sounds morbid,

22
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.030
but it is very valuable to me because

23
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.540
it emphasizes the

24
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.820
impermanence and the short duration of life

25
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.810
that we have,

26
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.180
which gives me a sense of urgency to pursue the things that are important.

27
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.260
Gives me a sense of urgency in having the

28
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.420
uncomfortable conversations that are so important in life that can

29
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:48.960
define the next chapters of your life that can change your life.

30
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.790
And without a sense of urgency,

31
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.890
when you sort of cover your eyes and ears to

32
00:01:55.891 --> 00:02:00.060
not think about death, it is easy to push things off to tomorrow, to tomorrow,

33
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:01.680
to tomorrow until you die.

34
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.810
And it's too late and you would have benefited from asking those uncomfortable

35
00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:10.260
questions, taking those uncomfortable actions far sooner.

36
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.230
So I have, for instance,

37
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.880
a memento Mori coin made by a friend of mine and author Ryan holiday,

38
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.870
well known for his writing on stoicism, which acts as a visual reminder,

39
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.450
I have different quotes that are laser etched onto driftwood that also serve

40
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:31.650
this purpose. And for that reason, Christian,

41
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:32.571
I,

42
00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:37.200
I don't try to avoid spending too much time thinking about the inevitability of

43
00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:42.150
death and the way that at least I find it empowering instead

44
00:02:42.151 --> 00:02:43.170
of overwhelming,

45
00:02:43.171 --> 00:02:47.790
is to recognize a it's outside of your control B.

46
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.970
It happens to everyone and see,

47
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.010
you can control in a sense or hone your perception of

48
00:02:56.011 --> 00:03:00.400
death and view it as a catalyzing help, as opposed to,

49
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.000
uh, an overwhelming sadness and practice that

50
00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:10.680
might seem unusual that I have found very valuable and this

51
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.410
hearkens back to an anecdote,

52
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.790
or maybe an allegory of sorts that I was told by Tara Brock,

53
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.260
famous meditation teacher. And that is a famous Sage once said,

54
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.450
the only question worth asking is what are you unwilling to feel?

55
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.220
So as you, you think about death and how you relate to death,

56
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.580
you may also think about how you relate to other emotions.

57
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.940
You don't want to feel for me,

58
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.620
particularly with a history of depression up until say five years ago,

59
00:03:43.621 --> 00:03:47.070
where I have not had any major depressive episodes in the last five years.

60
00:03:47.071 --> 00:03:48.150
And then I think in part,

61
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.720
what I'm going to describe has been very helpful for staving off depression.

62
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.580
I optimized for positive, positive, positive, positive meaning.

63
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.290
I wanted as many moments in my day to be purely positive as

64
00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:05.670
possible. I did not want to feel sad. I did not want to feel tired.

65
00:04:05.671 --> 00:04:08.910
I did not want to feel angry, so on and so forth.

66
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.610
Those emotions are going to surface.

67
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.650
And when you have labeled them as bad and try to

68
00:04:16.651 --> 00:04:21.360
refuse them with as much mental willpower and

69
00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:25.800
emotional willpower as possible, what you resist tends to persist,

70
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.450
and those things have an outsized impact on your life. Negative impact.

71
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.070
Conversely,

72
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.180
if you use here's the practice say minor key music,

73
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.190
which I had not used until a few years ago,

74
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.250
didn't listen to minor key music and just look up minor,

75
00:04:41.251 --> 00:04:44.400
key piano music to get a taste for what this sounds like.

76
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.290
It instills melancholy. It has a sad sound to it. And I've,

77
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.880
I've begun listening to music that evokes that type of

78
00:04:53.881 --> 00:04:58.770
feeling deliberately because at the end of listening to this

79
00:04:58.771 --> 00:05:00.510
music for say five to 10 minutes,

80
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.380
and then you play another track that has a more upbeat feeling to it,

81
00:05:04.381 --> 00:05:06.600
say a lot of Boston Nova from Brazil,

82
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.730
you realize that the sadness much like mint is

83
00:05:11.731 --> 00:05:15.780
transient and that your psyche is poorest in that sense,

84
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.490
the excitement flows, right? And then it flows out of you, not literally,

85
00:05:20.491 --> 00:05:24.780
but of course that is the subjective experience. And that's also true sadness,

86
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.400
which a lot of us try to avoid.

87
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.920
And when you realize how transient that is and how you can turn it on and turn

88
00:05:31.921 --> 00:05:35.790
it off with cues in your environment, it becomes less intimidating.

89
00:05:35.791 --> 00:05:39.270
It becomes less overwhelming. You can use films in the same way,

90
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.100
watching films that are scary, sad, depressive,

91
00:05:44.101 --> 00:05:45.000
whatever it might be.

92
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.810
And then contrasting that with something that is on the opposite end of the

93
00:05:48.811 --> 00:05:53.490
spectrum, that is a practice. In other words,

94
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.820
seeking out artistic cues,

95
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.730
that catalyze emotions,

96
00:05:58.731 --> 00:06:03.230
historically you've tried to avoid that transcends the practice

97
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:08.150
itself and helps you to relate differently to things like death,

98
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.230
because most likely what you fear or what you find

99
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.190
abhorrent is not so much death itself,

100
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.140
but the way that you're emotionally relating to the concept

101
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:24.290
or definition of death. I know that sounds very, very abstract,

102
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.270
but that is one way that I've approached this in controlled legal

103
00:06:29.271 --> 00:06:29.721
settings.

104
00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:34.610
I will also say that transcendent psychedelic experiences can

105
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.850
greatly remove if you're of death. Uh,

106
00:06:37.851 --> 00:06:41.210
I think that relates to some of the phenomenology,

107
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.400
AKA subjective reports of a feeling

108
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:49.100
of fusing with source consciousness,

109
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.280
but we're going to get off into crazy town talk real fast.

110
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:56.960
If we continue with discussing that particular aspect of my own

111
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:01.790
personal journey, nonetheless, in a legal, safe,

112
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.360
supervised settings, that is also a tool in the toolkit.

113
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:09.410
It can be an overused tool in the toolkit, but nonetheless,

114
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:13.060
it is one tool. Similarly, uh,

115
00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.270
there are questions you can ask that I think

116
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.450
show you or showcase the value of keeping death in

117
00:07:22.451 --> 00:07:26.020
mind, such as, uh,

118
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:30.850
one question and I'm going to paraphrase this. This is from Munib Ali,

119
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.120
who was in tribal mentors.

120
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.200
And I believe the question I asked him was what do you do when you feel

121
00:07:38.201 --> 00:07:42.490
scattered or overwhelmed and his response and Mooney of,

122
00:07:42.491 --> 00:07:46.360
I apologize if I'm not getting this completely right, but it's paraphrased.

123
00:07:46.361 --> 00:07:50.530
And I do use this a lot when you are experiencing something simple,

124
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.200
laying in a warm bed. Uh,

125
00:07:53.201 --> 00:07:56.650
an example that comes to mind for me is laying in a hammock, watching my dog,

126
00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.980
Molly, play with a stick. When you are on your deathbed,

127
00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.980
how much would you pay or even 20 years from now,

128
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:07.060
how much would you pay to relive this experience right now?

129
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.210
And very often that number gets quite high.

130
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.530
Maybe it's something that you physically might not be able to do 30 years from

131
00:08:14.531 --> 00:08:15.670
now, 40 years from now,

132
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:19.390
I was just skiing a few days ago and had a wonderful experience with two of my

133
00:08:19.391 --> 00:08:20.224
closest friends.

134
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:25.690
What would I pay 40 years from now to have that day

135
00:08:25.691 --> 00:08:28.270
back and experience that and think about it.

136
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:33.310
Don't throw away that question and make up a

137
00:08:33.311 --> 00:08:36.700
number, really think about what you might spend.

138
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:41.230
And I think that highlights the value of experience

139
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:46.420
relative to this decay that we all experienced past a certain point

140
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.640
on our descent to death.

141
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:53.530
And those are a few of the ways that I try to harness

142
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.990
mortality to empower and enrich wildlife as

143
00:08:57.991 --> 00:09:01.260
opposed to disabling or distracting,

144
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.460
if that makes sense. So those are a few tips,

145
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:08.760
a few recommendations that have been deeply helpful to me.

146
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:12.810
And if you'd like to learn more about stoicism,

147
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.920
then I would suggest you Google Tao of Seneca,

148
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:18.900
Tao of Seneca,

149
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:23.730
Seneca being one of the foremost writers or best known writers as it relates to

150
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:24.720
stoke philosophy.

151
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.250
I put together three large PDFs that are available for free with original

152
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:33.300
artwork and all sorts of fun stuff that dig deeper into the practical

153
00:09:33.301 --> 00:09:35.520
applications of stoke philosophy.
