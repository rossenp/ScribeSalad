<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.500
<v 1>You've explored these various tools and modalities.</v>

3
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.900
What is it about Zen that differentiates it for you or that

4
00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:18.380
you find attractive? Right? Because you could, you could reach out to,

5
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.610
or get ahold of your,

6
00:00:19.611 --> 00:00:22.670
one of your magic powers is getting a hold of getting a hold of anybody.

7
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.420
Basically. You want to get ahold of why is it, what is it?

8
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.410
I would say that when I first took my, the,

9
00:00:30.411 --> 00:00:32.540
when I first took the introductory course to Zen,

10
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.070
I appreciated the

11
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.980
mystery behind it, in some sense.

12
00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:44.690
So I was attracted to how it could

13
00:00:44.691 --> 00:00:49.490
be a strict discipline in some ways, like,

14
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.370
you know, like kind of one of those things where you show for Zen,

15
00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:56.540
and if you're not there, the second you're supposed to be there,

16
00:00:56.541 --> 00:00:59.240
they'll keep you out from coming in and you're, you're rejected.

17
00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:02.780
Or if you want to train and actually set residents, they're like,

18
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.540
you have to prove it by sleeping outside for like two months.

19
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.420
Like all these stories that you hear, that Henry actually talks to me,

20
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.550
it can be super hardcore or like,

21
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.810
he let you go to the Zaza in a room and you're,

22
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.960
you're separated by these like cubicle walls. Right? And so you're,

23
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.280
you're sitting in Zaza and it's like seated meditation with your face about a

24
00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:26.570
foot and a half away from a wooden wall. And then if you start to nod off,

25
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.160
they might hit you with a little wooden switch, things like that. Yeah. So,

26
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.420
you know, I kind of,

27
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.310
I was initially attracted that now Henry's discipline that he's into that he's

28
00:01:37.311 --> 00:01:40.550
teaching his is a little bit more laid back, which I, which I can appreciate.

29
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.340
Cause this is like, you know, when you're going to, to,

30
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.390
you had to enter with your right foot when you're entering into set,

31
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.250
like you have to enter into the room,

32
00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:52.280
the correct way you can't cross over the mat and the wrong way,

33
00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:54.410
like there's all these rules, right. Too many roles,

34
00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:59.360
but it's also very Japanese, but I, it is very Japanese, which I,

35
00:01:59.361 --> 00:02:02.300
you know, we all, both of us really love. Um,

36
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.110
but the one thing I will say about Zen is that in, uh,

37
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.780
especially with the way that Henry has been teaching,

38
00:02:08.781 --> 00:02:13.490
at least that I gathered through his book and through our conversation is that

39
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.870
they're,

40
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.700
they make enlightenment less mysterious and less about

41
00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:24.050
being a perfect person and making it actually seemed like it's something that is

42
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:25.880
attainable by everyone.

43
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.840
And it doesn't have to mean that you're this ultimate spiritual guru.

44
00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:32.960
The second you snap into these different States, States of consciousness.

45
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.210
And that there are these really beautiful moments when people

46
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.470
have this flip, like this flip in their brain, this switch that goes,

47
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.980
and then they're, they're jolted almost shocked into this,

48
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.210
the state of consciousness,

49
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.570
like sometimes like there's these stories of these Zen masters will the look at

50
00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:53.840
a student the right way and the student won't grasp it. And the student can,

51
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.900
they've been stuck, they've been teaching and sitting and they just can't.

52
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.420
And they'll just shake them in a certain way and spontaneously jolt them in the

53
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:05.530
right way into enlightenment. And as these, these funky little things like that,

54
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:08.590
that are just like beautiful stories. And like, you know,

55
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.690
you always take a lot of that stuff with a grain of salt,

56
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:14.500
but coupled with this KoAnn training, which I,

57
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.000
which I highly recommend listening to on, on the waking up app, they're,

58
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.850
they're fantastic by Henry. Um, it, it just it's,

59
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.960
it checks all the boxes that I'm curious about. And I think for me,

60
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.700
the curiosity at this point is the most important thing because it's encouraging

61
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:34.090
me and it gives me the drive to go and sit for a half hour every morning

62
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.940
consistently. And, you know, that's what it's going to take.

63
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.350
It's going to take a real dedication. And I think that if I can get the proper,

64
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.940
uh, training coupled with these koans, and I don't know, it just,

65
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.910
I I've, I've done the transcendental meditation.

66
00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:53.620
I've done about a few other disciplines and this one for some reason, um,

67
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.440
maybe it's cause I'm a, Japanophile like, I don't know all the reasons,

68
00:03:56.441 --> 00:03:59.040
but I'm attracted to it. Cool.

69
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.190
Do you know what the training is going to look like and what the meditation

70
00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:05.160
sessions are going to look like? Yeah. I mean, they're very simple.

71
00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:05.994
You just set,

72
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.890
so like I'm more interested in what happened,

73
00:04:10.891 --> 00:04:15.000
what happens inside the head? So you sit, maybe you shave your head.

74
00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:18.180
I would love to see you the shaved head. That'd be hilarious. Uh,

75
00:04:18.181 --> 00:04:22.080
so we can kind of thing. Yeah, we can, we can be cue balls together.

76
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.880
Uh, get you some black robes with some, some white. Interlinings be good.

77
00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:29.100
Good luck for you. Uh, you kind of already have that.

78
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.850
<v 2>I was gonna say, you see me with robes on people we've been in rubs together.</v>

79
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.880
<v 1>You already got that one, but okay. You sit and then what,</v>

80
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.770
what happens on the inside? So I think there's a, there's a few things. One, um,

81
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.680
the question initially is there is there's kind of table stakes to,

82
00:04:48.681 --> 00:04:51.800
to play in the arena. And I would say like to,

83
00:04:51.801 --> 00:04:56.790
to even get to that point, um, at least for, for me,

84
00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.040
when I've, what I've been told and what I can gather, and I'm, I'm,

85
00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.230
I'm saying this as someone that is well,

86
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.240
pretty new novice to this new sect of Zen, um,

87
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.930
it's just sitting and trying to quiet the mind, you know,

88
00:05:09.931 --> 00:05:12.720
and that means counting meditations, um, you know,

89
00:05:12.721 --> 00:05:16.980
counting to 10 and repeating yourself, uh, following the breath. Uh it's,

90
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.540
it's that classic Zen posture of looking at the wall, not closing your eyes,

91
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:25.980
kind of glancing somewhat downward towards the ground with a, uh,

92
00:05:25.981 --> 00:05:28.440
fuzzy awareness of everything going on in the room,

93
00:05:28.441 --> 00:05:32.520
but no strict focus on any one object it's saying to yourself,

94
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.950
a thought a distraction it's okay. It is, uh,

95
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.750
the weights in a gym is what I need to get to the next level of, of, of this.

96
00:05:42.751 --> 00:05:45.320
And so not getting upset and,

97
00:05:45.321 --> 00:05:50.130
and getting the mind to where it's a little bit malleable and kind of getting to

98
00:05:50.131 --> 00:05:53.850
that place where this, the CITs are becoming, uh,

99
00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.740
longer in duration, but also the mind is calming a bit.

100
00:05:57.741 --> 00:06:00.230
I think Henry said it best in his book. Actually,

101
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:02.780
this is a I'm going to butcher it, but I'll, I'll, I'll,

102
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:04.160
I'll tell you the gist of it.

103
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.180
He said the Zen is like pulling the plug,

104
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.650
being a boat in a bathtub and pulling the plug of the drain.

105
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.930
And initially you kind of just notice a little bit of swirling,

106
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.030
a little bit of like movement of the boat.

107
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.630
And then you look around and you see the walls of the bathtub are a little bit

108
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.790
higher and you're like, Oh, that's odd.

109
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.140
And then you notice a little bit more movement and all of a sudden you start to

110
00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:30.800
twist.

111
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.250
And then all of a sudden you notice that there's a swirl going down the drain.

112
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.780
And then there is the total annihilation of all things,

113
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.230
and that's where you're headed, but you don't,

114
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.370
but you have to sit at the surface for a while and just kind of like, you know,

115
00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:49.820
slowly realize that even though you're not feeling it,

116
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.650
the daily practice is unplugging the drain and you will eventually get there.

117
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.220
So I'm not gonna find this terrifying description. Oh dude,

118
00:06:58.221 --> 00:06:59.540
wait till you read his book,

119
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.310
his description of his last traunch of this

120
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.500
passing into this.

121
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.070
I think you would actually really like it because it reminds me of a lot of our

122
00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:14.150
conversations that you've had around like Iowasca and some of the ego

123
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.930
just disintegrating and cattle, death control deaths.

124
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.040
And he's getting that without any drugs, man, just like intense,

125
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.040
like multi-day meditation kind of things that happen, you know, for, for,

126
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.880
I guess a lot of reasons. I think that scares me more because with,

127
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.490
with a T you're like, all right,

128
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:37.630
I'm going to go to crazy town for four to six hours earth time.

129
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.190
And then I'll be back to some semblance of like normal

130
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.890
computation and absorption of what we call reality.

131
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.180
But with the Zen practice, with that description, it's,

132
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:57.010
it's almost like a slow motion psychotic break that you've

133
00:07:57.011 --> 00:08:00.670
engineered for yourself. And that scares the living out of me. So that's,

134
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.140
I don't know how to back out of that. I don't know how to yeah. Yeah. You can't,

135
00:08:05.141 --> 00:08:07.000
that's the thing. That's crazy, dude.

136
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.460
When you read this book and you get to that point,

137
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:13.180
I'm freaked out by this because when you go there,

138
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.590
all of a sudden you're viewing the world as an illusion,

139
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.340
as a completely different thing than you ever have before.

140
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:25.090
And there's no going back. What does Daria think about this?

141
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.220
Is she supportive? Yeah.

142
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.980
She listened to my interview with him when I did the podcast. And she was like,

143
00:08:29.981 --> 00:08:33.910
yeah, he sounds amazing. And this is the path you want to go. Like,

144
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.180
I support it. I mean, I don't think she's not worried about you. Like,

145
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.070
I don't know. So we're in your shirt backwards and picking it Naval, lint,

146
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:46.880
like staring blankly at like the wall Paul, you have to, you have,

147
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.070
you have to listen to his post analysis of what happened because he wrote the

148
00:08:51.071 --> 00:08:52.450
book after all this happened.

149
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.890
And I'm be curious to know if you would enjoy this world. I think you would.

150
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:57.600
It sounds beautiful.

151
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.730
Like every moment is a new and just glistening and

152
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.960
there's so much, it's fascinating. I'm not a butcher at all.

153
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:12.180
I think much like you with me and my various, uh,

154
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:17.970
psychedelic experiments of which there are now many, many, many, many thousands.

155
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.940
Let me think for you. It's a lot. And uh,

156
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.460
you've kind of let me be the Guinea pig.

157
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:27.390
I think I'll let you be the first monkey shot in a space on this slow motion.

158
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:32.070
Engineered, psychotic break. Tell me how that goes. Yeah. I mean,

159
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.950
you're here to support, I think, well,

160
00:09:34.951 --> 00:09:37.080
it's not like you're going to see me in six months and like,

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.870

162
00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:43.320
