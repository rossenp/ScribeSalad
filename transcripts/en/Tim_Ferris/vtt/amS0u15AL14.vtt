00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.920
<v 0>Special, thanks to athletic greens,</v>

2
00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:05.280
the ultimate all in one nutritional supplement for supporting this video,

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.470
please see the link in the description to learn more.

4
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.840
<v 1>I've always been very type a and so a friend of mine got me into cycling when I</v>

5
00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:18.350
was living in LA and I lived right on the beach in Santa Monica,

6
00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:22.520
where there's this great bike path in the sand that goes for,

7
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.590
I think it's 25 miles in the sand, a 20 foot, no, hold on. Something like that,

8
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.940
the exact number doesn't matter.

9
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.830
But what I would do is I would go onto the bike path and I would get like head

10
00:00:33.831 --> 00:00:35.690
down and push it as hard as I could.

11
00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:40.460
I would go all the way to one end of the bike path and back, and then back home.

12
00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:42.650
And I'd set my little timer when doing this huffing.

13
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.750
<v 0>And puffing red face red.</v>

14
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.140
<v 1>Face, huffing it, but like just pushing it as hard as I can, every single,</v>

15
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.210
you know, thrust of the leg. And, uh, of course, you know,

16
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.570
that may be quite fun if somebody was in my way on the bike path.

17
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.290
<v 0>For sure. I'm like that. Guy's got places to go. So.</v>

18
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.070
<v 1>But I noticed it was always 43 minutes. I mean, you know, if you know,</v>

19
00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:05.360
Santa Monica, California, you know,

20
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:07.880
the weather is about exactly the same all year round.

21
00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:09.950
So unless it was a surprisingly windy day,

22
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.780
it was always 43 minutes is what it took me to go as fast as I could

23
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.310
for that, on that bike path.

24
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.740
But I noticed that over time I was starting to feel less

25
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.110
psyched about going out on the bike path because just mentally,

26
00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:30.710
when I would think of it, it would feel like pain and hard work.

27
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.670
<v 0>It sounds like pain and heartbreak. Yeah. I mean, it was, but.</v>

28
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.420
<v 1>I guess at first that was okay. And after a while it just felt like, Oh,</v>

29
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.290
I don't know, running the bike. Why don't I just hang out? Um,

30
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.420
so then I said, you know, that's not,

31
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.560
that's not cool for me to start to associate negative stuff with going on the

32
00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:50.930
bike ride. Why don't I just chill for once? Like,

33
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.930
I'm just going to go on the same bike ride, but just, you know,

34
00:01:53.931 --> 00:01:56.180
I'm not going to be a complete snail,

35
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.990
but I'll go at like half of my normal pace. So yeah,

36
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:02.060
I got on my bike and it was just pleasant.

37
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.360
I just went on the same bike ride more like standing up.

38
00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:08.750
And I just noticed that I was, I was looking around more and,

39
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.030
and I looked out in the ocean. I noticed there that day,

40
00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:15.470
there were these dolphins jumping in the ocean and I went down to Marina Del Rey

41
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.540
to my turnaround point. And um, Oh no, actually it was when the,

42
00:02:19.541 --> 00:02:21.680
the breakers at Marina Del Ray,

43
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.940
there was a penguin that was flying above me. I was like, no way I looked up,

44
00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:29.570
I was like, Hey, a penguin. And he in my mouth.

45
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.450
<v 0>Was it a penguin or a publican? Oh, sorry, Pelican</v>

46
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.890
penguin above me. I was like, what a, what did you take before your ride?

47
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.770
You had to see it a Pelican Pelican in your mouth. That's incredible accuracy.

48
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.490
Was that from like how far away was it like 20 feet up? Wow.

49
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.360
I don't know if he was accurate or I was, you know, so.

50
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.900
<v 1>It is, I had such a nice time. It was just purely pleasant.</v>

51
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.470
There is no red face. There was no huffing and puffing. I was just cycling.

52
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.090
It was nice. And when I got back to my usual stopping place,

53
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.950
I looked at my watch and it said 45 minutes.

54
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.500
And I was like, no way,

55
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.120
how the hell could that have been 45 minutes as compared to my usual 43?

56
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.080
It's like, there's no way. But yeah, it was right 45 minutes.

57
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.150
And that was like a profound lesson that I think changed the

58
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:35.200
way I've approached my life ever since is because I realized that I guess,

59
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.290
you know, what percentage of that huffing and puffing,

60
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:39.860
then we could do the math and whatever.

61
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.080
Over the 93 point something present of my huffing and puffing and all that red

62
00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:48.700
face and all that stress was only for an extra two minutes.

63
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.440
It was basically for nothing. I mean, you know,

64
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.260
of course we're not talking about me competing in something where the huffing

65
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:56.110
and puffing might've been worth it, but for life,

66
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.390
I think of all of this optimization and getting the maximum dollar

67
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:04.150
out of everything in the maximum amount of every second to the maximum amount of

68
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:08.950
every minute. And I think I just take this approach now of going like, Oh,

69
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:10.810
or you could just take the lesson,

70
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.410
take most of that lesson and apply it and be effective and be happy.

71
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.630
You don't need to stress about any of this stuff.

72
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.890
And so honestly that's been my approach ever since I do things,

73
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:23.050
but I stopped before anything gets stressful.

74
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:27.743
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

75
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.530
<v 0>All the time. What I would take. If I could only take one supplement,</v>

76
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.590
the answer is invariably athletic greens.

77
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.490
I view it as all in one nutritional insurance. I recommended it. In fact,

78
00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:42.600
in the four hour body,

79
00:04:42.601 --> 00:04:46.440
this is more than 10 years ago and I did not get paid to do so with

80
00:04:46.441 --> 00:04:50.160
approximately 75 vitamins minerals and whole foods sourced ingredients.

81
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.760
You'd be very hard pressed to find a more nutrient dense and comprehensive

82
00:04:53.761 --> 00:04:57.300
formula on the market. It has multivitamins multi-mineral greens,

83
00:04:57.301 --> 00:05:01.320
complex probiotics and prebiotics for gut health and immunity, formula,

84
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.740
digestive, enzymes, adaptogens, and much more.

85
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.820
I usually take it once or twice a day just to make sure I've covered my bases.

86
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.860
If I miss anything I'm not aware of,

87
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.210
of course I focus on nutrient dense meals to begin with that's the basis,

88
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.140
but athletic greens makes it easy to get a lot of nutrition when whole foods

89
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.510
aren't readily available from travel packets.

90
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.450
I always have them in my bag when I'm zipping around,

91
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.300
it's also NSF certified for sport,

92
00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:31.050
making it safe for competitive athletes as what's on the label is in the powder.

93
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.060
It is the ultimate all-in-one nutritional supplement bundle in one easy scoop.

94
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.290
And right now athletic greens is giving my audience that's you guys a special

95
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:42.660

which is a free vitamin D supplement with your first subscription purchase.

97
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.630
Many of us are deficient in vitamin D,

98
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.570
which is usually produced in our bodies from sun exposure.

99
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.490
So particularly in the winter months,

100
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.200
adding a vitamin D supplement to your daily routine is a great option for

101
00:05:57.201 --> 00:05:58.400
