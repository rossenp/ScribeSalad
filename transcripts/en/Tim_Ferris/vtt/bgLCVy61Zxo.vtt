1
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.220
<v 1>I wanted to be a comedian from the age of about 13,</v>

2
00:00:10.221 --> 00:00:15.170
14, you know? Um, and then I, I,

3
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:17.300
I did it two times,

4
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.100
three times when I was 17 and one time I did it and it went

5
00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:23.170
really well. And the,

6
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.360
and it was the comedy store in Sydney and you have to go down there and they put

7
00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:28.400
your name in a hat and they pull your name out.

8
00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:32.840
And I had five minutes and it was just all about being in school or whatever.

9
00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:37.280
I can't even remember what I talked about. And, um, uh, then they said, Oh,

10
00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:39.740
you're not 18. I, and I was like, nah. And they go,

11
00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:41.210
you have to come back with a parent.

12
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.030
And so I hadn't told my parents and my parents as well.

13
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.950
I hadn't even told them that I went into the city.

14
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.350
Like I wasn't allowed to go into the city. You know,

15
00:00:48.351 --> 00:00:51.020
I lived out in the suburbs and I told them I went to a mate's house or

16
00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:55.310
something. So I traveled into the city and, um, uh, so,

17
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.610
so next on army dad had to come with me and I remember it was like bucketing

18
00:00:58.611 --> 00:00:59.630
down with rain.

19
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.070
And I went out there and I got back on and the only other people in the

20
00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:06.770
audience, cause it was raining where the other comedians waiting to go on.

21
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:10.520
And there was the full range of people who were getting good at it.

22
00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:14.540
People who would never going to get good at it and people who their first go and

23
00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:17.270
people had been trying for years. And anyway, I got up,

24
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.430
I couldn't have had a worst gig.

25
00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:24.050
I couldn't have died worse than that. And I got in the car with me,

26
00:01:24.051 --> 00:01:28.070
dad afterwards, and me dad said, uh, you guys are,

27
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:31.310
you're a good kid and you got a lot of good qualities, but, uh,

28
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.420
but this isn't for you and I, my heart sank. And I,

29
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.000
then I went and did it one more time just to see,

30
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.990
cause at first I went so well and then I did it again and I died again.

31
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.300
And I went, all right, this isn't for me.

32
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:49.250
And then I didn't go up again until I was 20. I didn't do it. Yeah.

33
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.040
I waited another three years. I just think it was more than that.

34
00:01:52.041 --> 00:01:56.030
But I was in college and I used to run my own comedy night.

35
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
And I remember there was a, there was a,

36
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.160
I was in Perth when I started doing that.

37
00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:03.110
So a lot of people think I'm from Perth because of this,

38
00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:07.430
because I really started doing comedy in Perth. But, um, I, I th I, the,

39
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.390
the way that a lot of people get stage time is what you do is you find a venue,

40
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.590
you put your own shows on you, book your own comedians,

41
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.320
and that way you can emcee and you can get better by, you know,

42
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.830
cause I couldn't get gigs. So I thought I'd run my own gig. And there was,

43
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.720
there was this area in Perth called Claremont and Claremont,

44
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.040
um, had a, a serial killer at the time.

45
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.380
<v 0>Declare.</v>

46
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.830
<v 1>Had the claim on killer. All right. So what happened?</v>

47
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.600
I don't think they ever caught him. I don't know,

48
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.190
but maybe they did catch him on. I know, but when I was there,

49
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.130
that guy called the Claremont killer.

50
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.730
And what happened was with the claim on killer, all the,

51
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.900
all the bars that were normally, this was a big potty area of Perth.

52
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.490
They were all, no one was going out because all the girls who got killed,

53
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.230
the last thing that happened for them,

54
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.220
they left the nightclub and got into a taxi and went looking for a taxi and then

55
00:02:58.221 --> 00:03:01.600
they were never seen again. So that, that nightlife there just died.

56
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:04.420
So there was all these like bars that were just empty.

57
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.000
And so I went into one like, Oh, can I have a gig?

58
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.020
And they were just happy to have anyone in the building.

59
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.070
And I used to get like 15 people, me mates to come along to these shows.

60
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:16.600
And it was like a really popular bar.

61
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:19.840
But on a Friday night I could have a gig there because of the killer. So,

62
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.960
you know, silver lining to what happened there.

63
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.430
<v 2>And when you, if we go back to 17, you tried it three times,</v>

64
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.170
maybe this isn't for me,

65
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.640
what in your head was plan B or the alternative?

66
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.830
<v 1>Well, th th there's a weird thing sort of, I think there's a,</v>

67
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.340
you know, for people who really know about me and there's just not many people,

68
00:03:44.341 --> 00:03:49.110
but there's, there's a bit of a, a myth about me being an opera singer,

69
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.530
um, which is, is vaguely true. Right?

70
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.260
What happened was when I was 17,

71
00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.030
I was in a school musical and then I was doing all right. And then someone said,

72
00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:02.270
Oh, you should get some singing lessons and blah, blah, blah.

73
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.430
And so I got some singing lessons with this guy called Richard Gill,

74
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:06.960
who has since passed.

75
00:04:06.961 --> 00:04:11.160
And he was one of the main conductors for the Sydney opera. And he, he, um,

76
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.500
he got me, he, he got me a part in the chorus of, uh, of,

77
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.420
uh, Wagner as the flying Dutchman. And I had to sing in German. I was like 17.

78
00:04:21.421 --> 00:04:24.990
And I just sang, I just, I just bought a CD of this, this opera.

79
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.820
And I just mimicked it, you know? And I, I, I wasn't that greatest singer,

80
00:04:29.821 --> 00:04:34.170
but after that, I, I, I, um, I got into, uh,

81
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:35.371
WaPo,

82
00:04:35.371 --> 00:04:39.540
which is the Western Australian Academy of performing arts and I studied musical

83
00:04:39.541 --> 00:04:42.850
theater. And then I studied operating the next year. And so, so I,

84
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:47.430
I was a professional opera singer for a few weeks of my life, but it was never,

85
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.220
it was never a full thing, but I did this course.

86
00:04:50.221 --> 00:04:53.250
It was the same course that Hugh Jackman did. And it was like,

87
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.260
it was a full scholarship ride.

88
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.940
And I remember because I didn't have the marks in school to get into anything

89
00:04:59.941 --> 00:05:01.680
academic in university.

90
00:05:01.681 --> 00:05:04.950
And I don't believe I had the marks to actually get into this course,

91
00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:07.470
but they never checked my, for my high school certificate.

92
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.730
And I just went in and did a dance and singing audition and stuff.

93
00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.140
And I always still wanted to be a comic,

94
00:05:13.141 --> 00:05:15.690
but because I thought the comedy wouldn't work out,

95
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.620
I still wanted to be an entertainer and a performer. So I thought, ah,

96
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.510
this is another thing I can do. And it was also,

97
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.580
I think for my mother at that stage,

98
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.800
that was something that she was far happier to brag about,

99
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.930
that I was studying music in a prestigious college or something like that.

100
00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:37.530
But on maybe my second year into the course,

101
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.190
there was a comedian called Gary who, who is like a,

102
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.110
this guy who had been on Australian TV. I'm still,

103
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.140
I still know Gary to this day. He's very nice, man. And, uh,

104
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.240
he'd come over to do a gig in Perth. And I was his opening act. Then we had,

105
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.870
we had a few drinks afterwards. We got along.

106
00:05:51.871 --> 00:05:55.020
I think he liked me more as a person than he liked me as a comic. But he said,

107
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.600
he said, do you want to come and do these, these, um, mining town gigs?

108
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.430
And I thought, Oh, I thought, ah, that's too good, an opportunity.

109
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:05.720
So I quit university.

110
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.740
And I went out to like places like cow goalie and these little gold mining

111
00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:13.460
towns. And I performed in these bars just to like Australian Cowboys,

112
00:06:13.461 --> 00:06:15.110
pretty much like guys in cowboy hats,

113
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:20.180
they live out in the land and they work in the mines and all these towns had so

114
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:23.030
many men working out there.

115
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:27.050
And so few women that in the bars, in these towns,

116
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.690
the bartender would be a female and they'd be,

117
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.980
and they'd ship them in and they'd call them skimpy peas and a skimpy.

118
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:37.970
And she would just be topless. Now, th th this wasn't,

119
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.990
this wasn't, um, a strip bar. This was just a normal bar.

120
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.700
All the bars have topless bartenders in all these, um, little country towns.

121
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.200
And the reason for that is if you take away the topless,

122
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.110
go behind the bar, it's a guy bar.

123
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.150
It's just, it's just men. So, so they had to go, nah, we're not a guy.

124
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.600
Cause they will dress like Cowboys. Just the only thing that we're not gay,

125
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:08.360
there's a pair of over there. So where, all right. You know,

126
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.150
and so I did these gigs and I thought, and I had,

127
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.160
I hadn't told my parents that I'd quit university. I thought, you know,

128
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.790
I thought I'll just keep doing this until I can be a full-time comic.

129
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:22.460
And then I think it's basically the storyline of the movie,

130
00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:27.320
punchline that Tom Hanks character who said, uh, he said, Oh no,

131
00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:29.510
I'm going to be a doctor. I'm going to be a doctor. And then he said,

132
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:33.680
he'd tell his parents once he's a professional coming. But then I just quit uni.

133
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.550
I went back to Sydney, to my pants and said, I'm going to give standup comedy,

134
00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:42.470
a guy. And then I think I moved to England. Oh, I moved to England then,

135
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.560
um, I know the day I moved in then because, um,

136
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:50.000
I was packing my suitcase and about 10 o'clock at night

137
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.380
and I was all excited. It was going to be my first time traveling overseas.

138
00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:58.100
I'd never been, I know I tell a lot. I'd been to America once when I was 14,

139
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.430
but it was my first time traveling overseas by myself without family members

140
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.820
yet. And I was going on me, big adventure barmy sofa.

141
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.800
I was getting on a plane and, uh, and uh, I was packing me bags and the,

142
00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:13.310
and the twin towers fell down. And that's when I, that's how I can.

143
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:18.020
That's how I can remember the date that I left for Britain the next day. Yeah.
