<v 0>Optimal like this altitude.</v>

2
00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:06.060
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

3
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.460
I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.501
<v 1>Books.</v>

5
00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:28.940
I've loved on the Tim Ferriss show is exclusively brought to you by audible.

6
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.010
There couldn't be a better sponsor for this series.

7
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:35.000
My dear listeners and readers I've used audible for so many years,

8
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.890
as long as I can remember. I love it.

9
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.070
Audible has the largest selection of audio books on the planet.

10
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.580
I listen when I'm taking walks. I listen while I'm cooking.

11
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.180
I listen whenever I can. And if you're looking for a place to start,

12
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.730
I can recommend three of my favorites.

13
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.170
The first is the Tao of Seneca by Seneca.

14
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.640
If you want to hear my favorite letters of all time touches on stoic philosophy,

15
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.130
calmness under duress, et cetera.

16
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.300
The next is the graveyard book by Neil Gaiman,

17
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.480
G a I M a N one of my favorites,

18
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.610
even if you're a nonfiction purist,

19
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.340
this is the fiction book that you need to listen to.

20
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.200
Neo also has perhaps the most calming voice of all time and third,

21
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.530
Greg McKeown's essential ism subtitle.

22
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.390
The disciplined pursuit of less.

23
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.500
This is one of my favorite books of the past few years combines very well with

24
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:31.040
the 80 20 principle, but more on audible every month.

25
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.830
Audible members get one credit for any audio book on the site,

26
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.210
plus a choice of multiple audible originals from a rotating selection.

27
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:41.870
They also get access to daily news digests from the likes of the New York times

28
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:45.410
wall street journal and the Washington post as well as guided meditation

29
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:48.800
programs. And here are some other amazing audible features.

30
00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:52.580
And I use a bunch of these. You can download titles and listen offline anytime,

31
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.280
anywhere I use this feature,

32
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.660
even when I could get access, I'll put my phone on say airplane mode,

33
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.760
because I don't want to get bothered with notifications.

34
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.930
And I'm taking a walk to clear my head and you can listen to titles offline in a

35
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:07.760
case like that or on a plane or whatever.

36
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.290
Obviously I'm not flying much these days.

37
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.760
The app is free and can be installed on all smartphones and tablets.

38
00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:16.520
You can listen across devices without losing your spot.

39
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.690
And whisper sync is another feature I use quite a lot.

40
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.820
I love reading my Kindle in bed. For instance,

41
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.810
then picking up at the same exact spot where I left off.

42
00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:28.520
When I go walking and listening to the next day,

43
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.720
Kindle and audio versions can be synced up automatically is just amazing.

44
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.750
And if you can't decide what to listen to, don't sweat it.

45
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:36.584
You don't have to rush.

46
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.130
You can keep your credits for up to a year and use them for instance,

47
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:43.820

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.730
Hello, boys and girls, ladies and germs. This is Tim Ferriss.

62
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.710
Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show,

63
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.250
where it is usually my job to sit down with world class performers of all

64
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:46.300
different types, startup founders, investors, chess champions, Olympic athletes,

65
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:49.870
you name it to tease out that habits that you can apply in your own lives.

66
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.460
This episode, however,

67
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.470
is an experiment and part of a short form series that I'm doing simply called

68
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.640
books. I've loved. I've invited some amazing past guests,

69
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.940
close friends and new faces to share their favorite books.

70
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.490
Describe their favorite books. The books that have influenced them,

71
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.860
changed them, transform them for the better.

72
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.840
And I hope you pick up one or two new mentors in the form of books from this new

73
00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:16.000
series and apply the lessons in your own life.

74
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.210
I had a lot of fun putting this together,

75
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:23.830
inviting these people to participate and have learned so so much myself.

76
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.890
I hope that is also the case for you. Please enjoy.

77
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.040
<v 2>Hi, my name's Ann Miraco, I'm a co-founding partner at floodgate,</v>

78
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.930
which is a seed stage venture capital firm in Palo Alto, California.

79
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.060
Our firm is known really well for investing early or way too

80
00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:48.300
early into the world's craziest startups.

81
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.460
And as a result of my investing experience, I was named to the New York times,

82
00:04:53.461 --> 00:04:57.930
top 20 venture capitalists worldwide in 2019.

83
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.210
And that is because I have backed companies like Lyft and refinery

84
00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:06.510
29 before they were even known.

85
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.700
I'm also a lecturer in entrepreneurship at Stanford where I'm a co-director of

86
00:05:11.701 --> 00:05:13.350
the Mayfield fellows program.

87
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.900
I also got my PhD in math modeling of cybersecurity at Stanford back in

88
00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:19.734
the day.

89
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.970
And I am also a co-founding member of all rays,

90
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.920
which is a non-profit committed to improving diversity in funders

91
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.540
and founders.

92
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.970
I am so excited to talk to you today about some of the books that I have found

93
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.520
to be really important in my life.

94
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.870
And to tell you a little bit about why it's been life-changing for me.

95
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.790
So to start off,

96
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.560
I thought I would talk about this book called how will you measure your

97
00:05:49.561 --> 00:05:52.860
life? And it's written by a Harvard business school,

98
00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:54.990
professor Clayton Christiansen.

99
00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.500
I love Clayton story because he wrote this book

100
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.390
after he suffered some very significant health issues.

101
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.970
And in overcoming, uh,

102
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.030
the same type of cancer that had taken his father's life.

103
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.100
He started to think about not just business questions, where he had excelled,

104
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.640
but really how do you measure your life?

105
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.840
And as he thought about this, he wrote this book,

106
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.790
this very groundbreaking book about how do you balance your career and your

107
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:29.630
personal life,

108
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.460
and what is the source of happiness even within your personal life.

109
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.140
And there's a few lessons that I thought I would share with you today about

110
00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:41.240
why it made a difference for me.

111
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.660
And some of this is actually backwards looking.

112
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:48.710
And some of this is forward-looking. So in backwards looking,

113
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.410
he has actually even in business, uh, uh,

114
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.870
a framework that he talks about around immersion versus deliberate

115
00:06:56.871 --> 00:06:57.830
strategies.

116
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.140
And he applies this actually in life and an immersion strategy is

117
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:07.580
something that sort of comes up and it's not planned. And the,

118
00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:09.620
obviously the deliberate, uh,

119
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.650
is actually something that is very planned.

120
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.990
And he talks about how you balance these emergent and

121
00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:20.510
deliberate occurrences in your life.

122
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.160
And I think that in my life, when I look back,

123
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.750
I was fortunate enough to have incredible balance between

124
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.400
what emerged and some crazy luck that came into my life.

125
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.620
And then also planning for how I made myself

126
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.490
lucky. And to give you an example of what that was like,

127
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.380
I took a job. Um, I took almost all of my jobs, actually,

128
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.620
not because of some predestined plan,

129
00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:56.330
but because I really thought that the person I was going to work with

130
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.640
was incredible. And sometimes it fit into some plan that I had for my life.

131
00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:06.560
And sometimes it didn't fit in at all, but every time I took those steps,

132
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:11.570
and even when I couldn't explain it from a logical standpoint to anyone else,

133
00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:16.370
if I knew that the person that I was working for was going to be a

134
00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:18.230
huge source of inspiration,

135
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.790
someone I could learn from it was always the right decision. As an example,

136
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.920
in 2003,

137
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.820
I decided to go back to my PhD at Stanford.

138
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:33.260
And I knew that was going to be a five to maybe eight year commitment.

139
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.140
And a lot of people actually question why would do that?

140
00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:40.850
I was five years into my career and most people went straight into a

141
00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:44.270
PhD. And yet I felt this urge,

142
00:08:44.271 --> 00:08:47.000
this calling to actually go back and study.

143
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.630
And this was in 2003 and in 2003, uh,

144
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.280
Google had yet to go public.

145
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.510
And there were a lot of people with my work background who are starting to

146
00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:00.060
work there. And for a moment,

147
00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:03.320
I considered working at a place like Google.

148
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:08.300
And I remember talking to my now husband about

149
00:09:08.301 --> 00:09:11.780
this and saying, I just don't know, it's hard to explain,

150
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.220
but I have to scratch this itch to get my PhD.

151
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:21.200
And ultimately I remember number when Google IPO and I felt like maybe I had

152
00:09:21.201 --> 00:09:25.100
made the wrong call. I was making, I think $26,000 a year,

153
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.650
the graduate students stipend,

154
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.870
but even that didn't feel bad at the time. And when I, you,

155
00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.610
that I didn't feel badly about it.

156
00:09:34.611 --> 00:09:38.600
That's when I knew I'd made the right decision. And so, you know,

157
00:09:38.601 --> 00:09:43.160
sometimes there are things that you can plan out and there are other things that

158
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:47.030
you also realize lies in retrospect was the right decision.

159
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:50.060
And it doesn't look like it makes sense in the moment,

160
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.520
but your gut tells you that it's the right decision.

161
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:56.240
Then sometimes I've learned it's really important to follow your gut and Clayton

162
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:57.703
Christianson talks about.

163
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:02.150
The second thing that I really learned was he talks about,

164
00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:07.880
uh, the difficulty of figuring out what your job

165
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.250
is in human relationships.

166
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.980
And this comes from a business.

167
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:15.410
I work that clean Christians and talks about,

168
00:10:15.411 --> 00:10:20.060
which is what's the job to be done. And when he originally talked about it,

169
00:10:20.061 --> 00:10:23.540
it came from, um, a study he'd done at McDonald's,

170
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:28.370
where they studied, how people bought a breakfast items.

171
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:33.680
And it turned out that a bunch of people were buying milkshakes for breakfast.

172
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.300
And so McDonald's was trying to figure out what is this all about?

173
00:10:38.301 --> 00:10:40.100
Should they sell more milkshakes,

174
00:10:40.101 --> 00:10:45.050
more flavors of milk shakes and Clayton Christianson's group went

175
00:10:45.051 --> 00:10:45.830
in.

176
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:50.240
And instead of just diving into the question of how do they grow this revenue

177
00:10:50.241 --> 00:10:52.400
source, they asked the question,

178
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.030
what job did you hire that milkshake for?

179
00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.050
And it turns out the consumer who is buying the milkshake for breakfast fist

180
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:05.270
needed something that was portable and easy to eat or drink.

181
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:10.280
And so, because of the form factor of a milkshake was high calorie.

182
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:15.020
It was easy to hold and it was something that they could drink in

183
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.380
their truck. There was like a lot of people, uh,

184
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.210
who needed this sort of high calorie.

185
00:11:20.211 --> 00:11:23.540
They were usually doing a lot of physical labor. Um,

186
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.650
that's what they needed this milkshake for. And,

187
00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.940
and so he uses this framework of what job are you hiring a

188
00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:36.200
product to do in a lot of different, different areas to,

189
00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.340
to great effect. And I,

190
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:40.610
I even used that framework for a lot of my portfolio companies,

191
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:44.510
but he applies this actually in life, especially as a parent,

192
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:49.880
what job does my child need me to do? Uh, and I think,

193
00:11:49.881 --> 00:11:52.310
I think that's a really interesting question to ask,

194
00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:54.520
what job does my spouse need me to do?

195
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.580
Or what job does my parent need me to do?

196
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:02.710
And I try to actually think about this every morning. Uh,

197
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.820
and when I wake up in the morning, I sit and I,

198
00:12:06.821 --> 00:12:10.420
I think about the most important people in my life.

199
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:15.520
And this is exactly the question I try to ask myself and it's

200
00:12:15.521 --> 00:12:20.230
been incredible how I have figured out things that

201
00:12:20.231 --> 00:12:24.640
people need me to do for them in those really early hours of the morning,

202
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.860
because I've really reflected on it.

203
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:32.110
And I'm not reacting from a place of what I want to

204
00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:35.620
do for them, but rather what they need me to do.

205
00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:40.720
And then the third lesson that I extracted from this was more recently,

206
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:46.060
um, in chapter eight, clay Christianson talks about the school of experience.

207
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.750
And I really reflected on this chapter because of my daughter.

208
00:12:49.751 --> 00:12:54.340
Who's now 12 years old was going through something at school that really made

209
00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:57.370
her have to advocate for herself. And in this chapter,

210
00:12:57.371 --> 00:13:01.300
he talks about how you have to help your children learn how to do

211
00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:02.890
difficult things.

212
00:13:02.891 --> 00:13:07.780
And that's probably the most important role that we play as a parent.

213
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:11.650
And we have to equip them for the challenges of life.

214
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:16.480
And one of the things that I've really thought about is that advocating for

215
00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:21.220
yourself and figuring out what's the right solution for you

216
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.240
is an important skill set for kids to have.

217
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.450
And I felt like at 12, my daughter should have that by now.

218
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:33.940
So recently she was in a class that she was deeply unhappy with and

219
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:38.140
she decided she wanted to drop the class that she felt she wasn't learning

220
00:13:38.141 --> 00:13:38.860
anyway.

221
00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:43.780
And so she wanted to find an opportunity to drop the class and

222
00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:45.520
potentially do something else with the time.

223
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:50.530
So I asked her for a plan and I didn't help her with it.

224
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.300
But when she came back,

225
00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:56.050
she had not only figured out how to drop the class.

226
00:13:56.051 --> 00:13:59.260
She had gone all of the signatures she needed from the teachers.

227
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:03.970
She also had figured out a new class that she could TA for.

228
00:14:03.971 --> 00:14:06.790
So she could have credits during that period.

229
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.110
She figured out an online course that she could sign up for.

230
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.500
She found other students to take the online course with her.

231
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:19.900
She found a teacher who was willing to tutor her because she wanted an in-person

232
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:21.490
experience as well.

233
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.390
And she had done all of this on her own at the age of 12.

234
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:30.550
And it was amazing to me mostly because I wouldn't have

235
00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:35.380
thought that she was capable of that if I hadn't kind of forced her into that

236
00:14:35.381 --> 00:14:40.120
role. Uh, and I think that it gave her self-confidence as well. It gave,

237
00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.960
gave me self confidence as a parent. Uh, but this book,

238
00:14:43.961 --> 00:14:45.340
how will you measure your life?

239
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:49.930
I recommend it for anyone who's sort of starting off in their career in the

240
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:52.880
middle of their career, if they have kids, uh, it's,

241
00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:56.560
it's relative for almost everyone because it'll make you stop and think about

242
00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.700
where you spend your time, how you spend your time and why you do it.

243
00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:05.080
Just to change things up a bit. I'm going to talk about a second book,

244
00:15:05.081 --> 00:15:06.460
which is fiction.

245
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.660
And I read about 50% fiction and

246
00:15:10.661 --> 00:15:15.100
50%, uh, nonfiction. And, uh,

247
00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:20.050
my favorite book that I keep recommending to every single person I

248
00:15:20.051 --> 00:15:24.520
meet is this book that I read probably six or seven years ago,

249
00:15:24.521 --> 00:15:29.290
it's called the dove keepers. And it's by one of my favorite authors.

250
00:15:29.291 --> 00:15:30.850
Her name is Alice Hoffman.

251
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.920
And this book is about a fictionalized

252
00:15:35.921 --> 00:15:40.300
account. 2000 years ago of

253
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:46.180
900 Jews held out against Roman

254
00:15:46.181 --> 00:15:48.400
armies, uh, on,

255
00:15:48.401 --> 00:15:51.430
in this area in Israel called Massada,

256
00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.620
it's a mountain in the Judean desert.

257
00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:56.110
It's a place that you can still actually visit.

258
00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:01.240
And it is long known that it was the last strong hold of the Jews in this

259
00:16:01.241 --> 00:16:02.074
period.

260
00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:07.030
And according to sort of this ancient rumor,

261
00:16:07.031 --> 00:16:11.530
there were two women and five children who ultimately

262
00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.880
survived. And so the Romans essentially, um,

263
00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:21.040
attacked this fortress that was at the top of this mountain by

264
00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:26.200
building essentially a ramp up to the top of the

265
00:16:26.201 --> 00:16:30.260
mountain over two years. And so the,

266
00:16:30.261 --> 00:16:34.780
the 900 Jews who are waiting it out on the top of this mountain knew that this

267
00:16:34.781 --> 00:16:39.190
was coming for some time and basically all commit suicide at the end.

268
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:43.030
And the, the rumor was that two women and five children survived.

269
00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:47.860
And this story takes the perspective of

270
00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:52.210
one of the survivors and talks about how, um,

271
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:56.380
they escape and the story Lori was so beautiful and so

272
00:16:56.381 --> 00:16:59.620
compelling that for all this time,

273
00:16:59.621 --> 00:17:04.270
I've wanted to go to Massada. And this next February,

274
00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:09.010
we, as a family are going to Israel. And of course,

275
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:14.260
one of the stops is going to be Massada because I absolutely have

276
00:17:14.261 --> 00:17:16.150
to see this place.

277
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.380
And I also absolutely need to see this incredible

278
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:25.630
Roman ramp that was built to the top of the mountain.

279
00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.080
So I think I'm going to try to reread this book actually,

280
00:17:29.081 --> 00:17:33.730
before I ended up in Masada in a few months,

281
00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.120
the third book that I really love is a book called the righteous mind,

282
00:17:37.121 --> 00:17:40.840
why good people are divided by politics and religion.

283
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.820
And it's written by Jonathan Haidt, H a I D T.

284
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.310
And he is a social psychologist.

285
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:54.000
I love this book because it clarified for me a lot of

286
00:17:54.001 --> 00:17:57.090
things that I've been feeling for so long around.

287
00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:01.200
I actually have a lot of different types of friends and friends who I think

288
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:05.220
would violently disagree with one another on a number of different topics.

289
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:06.840
I love them all.

290
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:11.040
And I also know that if I got onto the wrong

291
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:16.140
topic of conversation and confessed my beliefs to them,

292
00:18:16.141 --> 00:18:20.490
that we would end up in some serious

293
00:18:20.491 --> 00:18:24.240
disagreements with one another and as a high school debater,

294
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:29.190
I was forced to actually take the opposite side of what I

295
00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:30.930
believed multiple times.

296
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:35.970
And I think it allowed me to explore

297
00:18:35.971 --> 00:18:39.630
ideas more completely as a result. And,

298
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:41.280
and so I've,

299
00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:46.380
I feel like on some level I have sympathy for when,

300
00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:51.300
uh, someone believes something fairly different from what I

301
00:18:51.301 --> 00:18:55.290
believe, I try to keep it a relatively open mind, but what I,

302
00:18:55.350 --> 00:19:00.240
what I appreciated about what Jonathan wrote was that he said that one

303
00:19:00.241 --> 00:19:01.980
thing that, that really struck me,

304
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:05.280
morality binds and blinds.

305
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:10.500
And what he meant with that statement was that there is this

306
00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:15.180
deep seated need for people to actually belong.

307
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:19.230
And he actually says this one thing, which I thought was really interesting.

308
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:24.810
We do moral reasoning not to reconstruct the actual

309
00:19:24.811 --> 00:19:27.630
reasons why we ourselves came to a judgment.

310
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:33.000
We reason to find the best possible reason why somebody else ought to

311
00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:36.930
join us in our judgments. In other words,

312
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:41.760
reasoning is used to back up, not question judgment these days,

313
00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:46.200
and that's sort of a natural inclination of humans.

314
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:51.180
The other thing that he points out is that there's a group of people where we're

315
00:19:51.181 --> 00:19:54.390
all kind of part of it. If you're listening to this podcast,

316
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:59.340
Western educated, industrialized, rich,

317
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:01.680
democratic people,

318
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:06.770
he calls them weird because it's Western educated, industrialized, rich,

319
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:07.670
and democratic.

320
00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:12.800
We are actually outliers when it comes to morality.

321
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:17.780
The vast majority of the world actually believes

322
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.610
in strong communities, sacred things,

323
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:26.360
family, religion, nation States,

324
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:31.550
and people who live in weird locations are

325
00:20:31.551 --> 00:20:35.090
much more into individualistic rights.

326
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:40.580
And the way we perceive the world is not necessarily majority

327
00:20:40.581 --> 00:20:41.414
opinion.

328
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:45.980
He also talks about how religion itself can create

329
00:20:45.981 --> 00:20:50.800
incredibly altruistic, moral communities.

330
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:56.160
They create a much bigger than sense of self.

331
00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.850
And it made me think of this one time when I went to,

332
00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:05.250
to a volunteer opportunity and it was the County

333
00:21:05.251 --> 00:21:06.090
fairgrounds,

334
00:21:06.091 --> 00:21:10.900
and we're trying to help people get a free dentist or

335
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.160
done, and why you might think, you know,

336
00:21:14.161 --> 00:21:16.650
how big of a need is that? Well,

337
00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.740
it turns out that in Calgary [inaudible],

338
00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:21.930
when this was done in Bay area,

339
00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:27.360
there were people lined up for someone to look at their teeth or

340
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:31.290
help. Um, starting at two 30 in the morning,

341
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:33.420
they're opening up the Gates at eight.

342
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:38.370
And there were literally hundreds of

343
00:21:38.371 --> 00:21:42.720
volunteers who had lined up to help these people.

344
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:47.910
And literally every the volunteer there came

345
00:21:47.911 --> 00:21:49.560
from some church.

346
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.030
And it really made me think about how,

347
00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:57.630
how much that altruistic more

348
00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:03.330
sense and the sense of that there is something bigger than yourself,

349
00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:08.120
uh, creates incredible community and an incredible sense of giving.

350
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:14.220
The other thing that I learned from this book was that there are many

351
00:22:14.221 --> 00:22:18.150
ways to think about morality

352
00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:23.100
and many of us are really limiting how we look at

353
00:22:23.101 --> 00:22:27.270
morality, too. A few things that we think are super important,

354
00:22:27.271 --> 00:22:31.350
but that not everyone believes that. So, uh,

355
00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:36.480
he talks about how important care and release

356
00:22:36.481 --> 00:22:37.950
from harm is.

357
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:42.960
He talks about how another element of morality is fairness.

358
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:47.730
He also talks about how loyalty is important to somebody, people,

359
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:52.350
authority, Liberty, and sanctity and stuff.

360
00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:56.850
He calls this sort of the six kind of taste buds of morality,

361
00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:02.580
and that there are many places where the

362
00:23:02.581 --> 00:23:07.050
idea idea of what care and fairness and Liberty and

363
00:23:07.051 --> 00:23:11.700
loyalty and authority that all these things can actually

364
00:23:11.701 --> 00:23:16.230
seem very foreign or the interpretation of these

365
00:23:16.231 --> 00:23:20.070
values can be very different. So, as an example,

366
00:23:20.071 --> 00:23:24.780
he talks about how care for someone can be reflected

367
00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:27.120
as freedom from oppression,

368
00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:32.010
and that same care can also be interpreted as

369
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:37.560
how do you make sure that you help the people who have made sacrifices

370
00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.980
for them group or fairness,

371
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:44.640
be interpreted as civil and human rights.

372
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.280
And then on the other hand,

373
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:51.440
fairness can be interpreted as rewarding in proportion to your

374
00:23:51.441 --> 00:23:56.330
contribution or fairness can be social justice.

375
00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:01.640
And that we recognize that the wealthy exploit the middle class and the

376
00:24:01.641 --> 00:24:04.910
poor, and then at the same time,

377
00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.910
that same idea of fairness is again,

378
00:24:07.911 --> 00:24:10.430
rewarding in proportion to contribution.

379
00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:15.440
So it's just really interesting to see how these different

380
00:24:15.441 --> 00:24:20.210
ideas can translate in such different ways and how we

381
00:24:20.211 --> 00:24:23.210
might all say that one thing is important,

382
00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:28.460
but we can actually interpret it in completely different ways.

383
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.680
And when you look at the language that's being stated like many times you can

384
00:24:33.681 --> 00:24:37.130
actually agree with both sides.

385
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.700
It's just that we might be two ships passing in the night.

386
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:45.740
And so the righteous mind was important to me because it allowed

387
00:24:45.741 --> 00:24:50.570
me to open up my mind to different perspectives and allowed me to

388
00:24:50.571 --> 00:24:55.220
make sure that I know where my biases stand and why I might have

389
00:24:55.221 --> 00:25:00.140
them and allowed me to be more empathetic to people

390
00:25:00.141 --> 00:25:01.490
with very different views.

391
00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:06.290
So those are the three books that I have really found to be

392
00:25:06.291 --> 00:25:10.700
profoundly impactful, either in actual decisions or the way I think,

393
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:15.290
or travel plans, the righteous mind, the dove keepers,

394
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:19.430
and how will I measure my life, or actually,

395
00:25:19.431 --> 00:25:23.780
how will you measure your life? So the three books are the righteous mind,

396
00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:28.790
the dove keepers, and how will you measure your life?

397
00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:30.223
Thank you so much.

398
00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.950
<v 0>Hey guys, this is Tim again, just a few more things before you take off.</v>

short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

404
00:25:54.221 --> 00:25:55.540
pondering over the week.

405
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:59.200
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered it could include

406
00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:04.180
gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird that I've somehow dug up in the,

407
00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.310
uh, the world of the esoteric as I do.

408
00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:11.440
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared

409
00:26:11.441 --> 00:26:14.950
with my close friends, for instance. And it's very short.

410
