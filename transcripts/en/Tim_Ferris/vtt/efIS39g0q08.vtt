<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.410
<v 1>I do my best work, uh, with, uh, quite a bit of noise,</v>

3
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.480
some music typically, or some type of cafe restaurant environment.

4
00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.850
I'll give two, uh, one is the graveyard book by Neil Gaiman.

5
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.960
Fantastic, fantastic fiction book with an incredible narrator.

6
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.390
And this is water by David Foster Wallace to the commencement

7
00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:36.770
speech, the book, or listen, that has been most influential to my own path.

8
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.300
I would say are the moral letters to nucleus by Seneca,

9
00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:43.640
the younger, I have read all those letters.

10
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.920
I would say several dozen times. What do I like most about storytelling?

11
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.360
The ability to ride a wave of

12
00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:56.810
imagination, to the extent that I lose track of time.

13
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.080
If I had to pick one thing in fiction, plot, character, or setting,

14
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.970
I would choose character. I think that is the connective tissue. Realistically,

15
00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:09.140
I would probably narrate my memoir and just, it's such a specific genre of book.

16
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.730
It might be strange to have someone else do it,

17
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.780
but otherwise I would have to go with Neil Gaiman, even though I'm not British.

18
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.270
The guy's voice is just so hypnotic and incredible.

19
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.370
I write always for myself

20
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.610
or a few of my closest friends.

21
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.780
I'm never writing for a general audience. If I had to define it,

22
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.180
it's probably number one.

23
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.110
The simple answer is living in such a way that you'd like yourself.

24
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.370
If I had to add to that,

25
00:01:37.371 --> 00:01:41.900
I would say it's probably some combination of achieving what you want and also

26
00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:46.010
wanting what you have least favorite sound is any

27
00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:49.250
device at high volume on an airplane,

28
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.900
but some kid is using cause their parents are parenting by negligence,

29
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.130
little judgy answer, figure in need one of those.
