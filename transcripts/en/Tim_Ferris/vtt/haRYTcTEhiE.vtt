00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 0>So I get questions about when or how to trust your gut or trust</v>

2
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:06.240
your intuition.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.430
It is particularly funny on some level that I get asked this question,

4
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:12.840
because for decades,

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.440
I thought all emotion and effectively,

6
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:21.180
anything labeled intuition was completely a liability and a

7
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.770
self-deception effectively.

8
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.480
So I focused on spreadsheets pro and con lists and better yet

9
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.580
numbers and quantifiable metrics for almost every decision

10
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.690
that I made. And some of those decisions turn out very, very poorly.

11
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.920
I remember one in particular,

12
00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:42.570
where I was looking at these various contracts and different terms and clauses

13
00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:47.250
and strings of negotiation via email for TV project that I was

14
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:51.660
considering doing. And I agonized over this decision for many, many weeks,

15
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.440
the decision to go or not go to Greenlight or to red light to do the deal or not

16
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:57.660
do the deal after weeks of this.

17
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.700
And I'm trying to lay out everything in the most left-brained way possible.

18
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.990
And I know it's not actually from a neuroscience standpoint. Totally true.

19
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.980
But you get the idea from an analytical quantitative perspective.

20
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.230
The deal looked great,

21
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.580
but I didn't feel comfortable saying yes. And at one point,

22
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:20.340
my girlfriend at the time said late one night, she goes, well,

23
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:25.200
do you trust this guy or not? And I said, no, I don't. And she's like, well,

24
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:26.034
there's your answer?

25
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.870
So her approach was diametrically opposed.

26
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:34.800
One might think to mine, but I've come to believe,

27
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:38.610
especially in the last handful of years that to

28
00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:41.760
ignore your gut feeling.

29
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:46.260
And I think there is something to that phrasing gut feeling to ignore what you

30
00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:47.970
might term intuition.

31
00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:52.650
Although that word is very often overused is to ignore and

32
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.880
to, uh,

33
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.650
in some ways spurn millions of years of evolution

34
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.750
and that the prefrontal cortex sort of executive function spreadsheet version

35
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.410
of human decision-making is actually very, very new.

36
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.300
And that it is an addition to not a replacement

37
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:15.660
for the gut feelings that we have.

38
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.400
Let's explore that just a little bit, because many people will say,

39
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.270
I intuitively feel this. My intuition tells me that,

40
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.320
and it's used as a catch-all. It is used as a default.

41
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.940
My feeling is that intuition feeling, et cetera,

42
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:34.740
is best used.

43
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.050
When you have demonstrated the ability to think rationally

44
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.550
in a structured way, through problems in your life. You need both.

45
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.410
You definitely need both because it is easy to say my intuition says

46
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:51.540
X when in reality,

47
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.830
what that means is you're just afraid of doing Y or you don't have the skills

48
00:02:55.831 --> 00:03:00.490
necessary to do Y so you rationalize that as some type of

49
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.080
other worldly intuitive hit, and that is normally. Uh,

50
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.290
so let's talk about how I've applied,

51
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.930
what we might term intuition in a way that I find very pragmatic and it

52
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:18.550
comes from, uh, two people who I respect greatly, uh,

53
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.950
Diana Chapman and Jim Detmer.

54
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.290
And they are part of the conscious leadership group.

55
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.790
Is that right? I believe that's right. I'm looking at my fact checker, but, um,

56
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.790
I think I'm getting that right. The conscious leadership group, CLG,

57
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:38.020
which was originally introduced to me, vis-a-vis their book,

58
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.490
which I believe again,

59
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.050
is the 15 commitments of conscious leadership let's fact check that

60
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.363
I think we're good,

61
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.600
which was introduced to me by Dustin Moskovitz co-founder of Facebook.

62
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.960
And when Dustin recommends anything to me, I pay a lot of attention.

63
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.050
And so that is the door through which I was introduced to them.

64
00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.490
I reached out to them when I was working on a book that I decided to cancel.

65
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.410
Not because the content wasn't really good,

66
00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:06.670
but because I didn't want to dedicate the energy to doing a multi-year book,

67
00:04:06.671 --> 00:04:09.040
project, a book about saying no,

68
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.140
and I wanted to talk to Diana and Jim, but specifically Diane,

69
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.580
a lot about a concept they use called the whole body. Yes.

70
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.610
What does this mean?

71
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.350
So we're trying to look at the entire realm of

72
00:04:25.351 --> 00:04:26.820
possibilities in life.

73
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.310
The things we can say yes to the things that we can say no to,

74
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.570
it's very helpful to have some heuristics, some rules of thumb,

75
00:04:33.571 --> 00:04:36.480
some basic guidelines for what to say yes.

76
00:04:36.481 --> 00:04:39.180
Or what to say no to what are your policies in other words,

77
00:04:39.181 --> 00:04:42.660
so that you're not making a million decisions every day about what to say yes or

78
00:04:42.661 --> 00:04:46.590
no to, and the whole body, yes. Is, is one of their frameworks.

79
00:04:46.591 --> 00:04:50.010
I found most useful. It's very simple in some ways,

80
00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:51.660
but it takes some time tune in,

81
00:04:51.661 --> 00:04:55.590
especially if you over caffeinate or use a lot of booze or whatever that throws

82
00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:58.320
off your sort of perception baseline,

83
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.880
you may need to cut back on those things to get a really accurate read.

84
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.320
Whole body S is simple.

85
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.490
You're considering going to a coffee date with someone because they asked you

86
00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:11.910
out to pick your brain or whatever you're considering doing a deal of some time

87
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.240
you are considering going on a trip, you get invited to speak.

88
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.200
You are asked to do a favor from someone, whatever it is,

89
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.390
you check in you to ask yourself or simply pay attention to

90
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.850
three things. Is it a yes. In your mind, in other words,

91
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.950
sort of analytically or intellectually, is it a yes. Okay. That's a yes. No.

92
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.290
In your gut. All right. Is it a yes or is it an unimpressed? Paraphrasing?

93
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:42.810
All of this Diana would do a much better job, but in your gut,

94
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.920
is it a yes or no? All right. And then in your heart,

95
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.560
this is the one I have the toughest time with, but like in your heart,

96
00:05:49.561 --> 00:05:52.500
sort of emotionally is how I translate that for myself.

97
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.100
Are you emotionally in or are you emotionally, right?

98
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.670
So is it a yes or a no in your sort of HeartSpace,

99
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:05.450
let's call it even though it sounds very woo hand-wavy San Francisco love you

100
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:09.980
guys live there for a long time. Nonetheless, if it is, yes,

101
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.020
yes, yes. That is a whole body. Yes.

102
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:14.540
And you should do it if it is anything less than that,

103
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.950
if it's a no on any of those parameters, then the blanket answer is no.

104
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.650
And this whole body, yes.

105
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.300
Might seem stupid or simplistic when I first describe it.

106
00:06:26.301 --> 00:06:30.350
But I've found it invaluable for making some really important decisions,

107
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.150
including saying no to writing this entire book, which is a separate story.

108
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:38.420
I'll tell another time in greater detail,

109
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.610
but the whole body yes. Is a check-in. And it also,

110
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:44.660
if you like me,

111
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:49.460
for many decades are left brain dominant and really just focus on the numbers

112
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:50.630
and the spreadsheets. And so on.

113
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:55.520
You have probably alienated yourself from a lot of feeling.

114
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.850
There are perhaps a lot of things you don't want to feel,

115
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.170
or a lot of things you protected yourself from perhaps from childhood trauma,

116
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.270
who the knows, right? Any number of things,

117
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.420
no one gets out of childhood unscathed, as they say.

118
00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.370
And in many cases we've developed coping mechanisms that make us very good at

119
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:14.780
some type of achievement,

120
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.770
but there are many decisions made that we wish we could undo.

121
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.570
And one of the ways of avoiding some of those bad decisions is this whole body.

122
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.920
Yes. Check-in is it yes. Here? Is it? Yes. Here is it yes. Here in the gut,

123
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:31.010
the way that I have interpreted that and used it most frequently,

124
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.400
because I'm not really sure what a yes. In the heart means.

125
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.160
I'm not totally clear on that. I'm also not really clear what a yes.

126
00:07:37.161 --> 00:07:38.300
In the gut means,

127
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.170
but I do know what a no feels like for me,

128
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.060
any constriction in the chest, that's a no, any discomfort in the gut,

129
00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:51.020
any type of emotional recoiling or if Venus that's a no.

130
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.910
And another expression,

131
00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:57.860
which I have found very helpful is when in doubt, there is no doubt.

132
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.660
So what does that mean? It's very simple. If you're like, hell yes.

133
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.930
Kind of along the lines of Derek, Sivers one of my favorite entrepreneurs.

134
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:11.240
Programmers are tests. His policy is if it's not a hell. Yes, it's a no.

135
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:16.100
And if you find yourself hemming and hawing, like, ah, I don't know. Oh God,

136
00:08:16.101 --> 00:08:19.280
I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure you are. Sure.

137
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.460
That means something in your body or your mind is saying no.

138
00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:26.660
And therefore it's a no, right. And yes, you have to do your taxes. Okay.

139
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.310
Got to pick your kids up from school.

140
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:32.940
There are things that may not bring unbridled joy to your

141
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:36.650
brain, heart and got the take care of. So don't be irresponsible.

142
00:08:36.651 --> 00:08:40.640
Don't be totally ridiculous about it. But for a lot of decisions, uh,

143
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:45.020
this can make the difference in leaning. Yes or no.

144
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.930
Is it a whole body? Yes. He said he is here.

145
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:52.640
Is it a yes in the heart is the S in the gut, anything less. And it is a no.

146
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:54.860
So they have it.

147
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.910
That is where I am currently with thinking about a lot of intuition and gut

148
00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:03.150
reading. And so on. There are more tools in the toolkit,

149
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:04.110
but that is one that I found.
