<v 1>One of your most popular,</v>

3
00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:11.630
if not the most popular post of yours in 2019 on your blog, uh,

4
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.490
was how I practice at what I do. I believe that's the name of the,

5
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.830
of the blog post, please. Correct me if I'm wrong. That's correct.

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.390
And to quote that blog post

7
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.770
you wrote recently, one of my favorite questions to bug people with has been,

8
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.940
what is it that you do to train that is comparable to a pianist,

9
00:00:31.941 --> 00:00:35.030
practicing scales. If you don't know the answer to that one,

10
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:37.340
maybe you are doing something wrong or not doing enough.

11
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.000
Could you elaborate on that please? Well,

12
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:45.320
say you're a social scientist or you're a writer, or you give public talks.

13
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.690
You are out there in some way all of the time. But if you look at people like,

14
00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:55.520
say what Kobe Bryant did or what Martina Navratilova did they practice to an

15
00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:58.040
extreme degree? And that's how they got better.

16
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.260
Martina was not world number one player until she had an intense regime

17
00:01:03.261 --> 00:01:06.050
of proper practice Coby, the older he got,

18
00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:07.970
he realized he needed to practice more.

19
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.350
Whereas a lot of top stars actually practice less and they coast on reputation

20
00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:14.180
and they've a guaranteed contract.

21
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.860
So just every day you want to be reading, you want to be talking,

22
00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:22.850
you want to be thinking you want to be exercising and do it, you know,

23
00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:25.190
at an intense level, as you can.

24
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.880
And just try to do that all day long and that's practice. And you know,

25
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:32.390
one hopes that will make you better. It's not for you to say, but you know,

26
00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:36.980
that's the hope, how do you practice your scales? What does,

27
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.870
what does scales look like for you writing out large quantities

28
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:44.510
of material, much of which I never use her publish,

29
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.550
writing out different points of view,

30
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.940
which are not my own is also a way of practicing,

31
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.560
trying to talk to a very diverse set of people. In my case,

32
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:59.210
not just academics, not just people. I went to high school with say,

33
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.000
uh, listening to highly complex music.

34
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.120
I think as a way to keep your mind active, uh,

35
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.820
periodically reading serious fiction,

36
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.330
I think is something people stopped doing after they hit a certain age,

37
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.470
maybe 30 or 40,

38
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.820
but it forces you to be open to the complexities of how humans actually are.

39
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.740
I recommend that too. If someone listening were a

40
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.010
non-fiction purists say they quit at 20 and it had not been

41
00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:32.660
reading fiction sense of there are any particular fiction books that you might

42
00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:37.010
recommend for someone to use as their re-entry to the world of complex fiction

43
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.550
or fiction. Overall, I would have to know their biography,

44
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:43.340
but I would start with Harold bloom spoke the Western Canon,

45
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.150
which has a list and surveys. A lot of his favorite works.

46
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.450
A few of which are nonfiction by the way, and, uh,

47
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.270
dig in there and just find what you love and pursue it.

48
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.970
I think the greatest writer is Shakespeare. Uh,

49
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.680
it's not necessarily for everyone.

50
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.060
And if you did not grow up writing and reading English,

51
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.290
it's probably not for you, but that would be one start.
