00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:06.060
I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking.

I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

<v 1>Books.</v>

5
00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:28.940
I've loved on the Tim Ferriss show is exclusively brought to you by audible.

6
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.010
There couldn't be a better sponsor for this series.

7
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:35.000
My dear listeners and readers I've used audible for so many years,

8
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.890
as long as I can remember. I love it.

9
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.070
Audible has the largest selection of audio books on the planet.

10
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.580
I listen when I'm taking walks. I listen while I'm cooking.

11
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.180
I listen whenever I can. And if you're looking for a place to start,

12
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.730
I can recommend three of my favorites.

13
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.170
The first is the Tao of Seneca by Seneca.

14
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.640
If you want to hear my favorite letters of all time touches on stoic philosophy,

15
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.130
calmness under duress, et cetera.

16
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.300
The next is the graveyard book by Neil Gaiman,

17
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.480
G a I M a N one of my favorites,

18
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.610
even if you're a nonfiction purist,

19
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.340
this is the fiction book that you need to listen to.

20
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.200
Neo also has perhaps the most calming voice of all time and third,

21
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.530
Greg McKeown's essential ism subtitle.

22
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.390
The disciplined pursuit of less.

23
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.500
This is one of my favorite books of the past few years combines very well with

24
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:31.040
the 80 20 principle, but more on audible every month.

25
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.830
Audible members get one credit for any audio book on the site,

26
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.240
plus a choice of multiple audible originals from a rotating selection.

27
00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:41.870
They also get access to daily news digests from the likes of the New York times

28
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:45.410
wall street journal and the Washington post as well as guided meditation

29
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:48.800
programs. And here are some other amazing audible features.

30
00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:52.580
And I use a bunch of these. You can download titles and listen offline anytime,

31
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.280
anywhere I use this feature,

32
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.660
even when I could get access, I'll put my phone on say airplane mode,

33
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.760
because I don't want to get bothered with notifications.

34
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.930
And I'm taking a walk to clear my head and you can listen to titles offline in a

35
00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:07.760
case like that or on a plane or whatever.

36
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.290
Obviously I'm not flying much these days.

37
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.760
The app is free and can be installed on all smartphones and tablets.

38
00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:16.520
You can listen across devices without losing your spot.

39
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.690
And whisper sync is another feature I use quite a lot.

40
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.820
I love reading my Kindle in bed. For instance,

41
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.810
then picking up at the same exact spot where I left off.

42
00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:28.520
When I go walking and listening to the next day,

43
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.720
Kindle and audio versions can be sinked up automatically is just amazing.

44
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.750
And if you can't decide what to listen to, don't sweat it.

45
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:36.584
You don't have to rush.

46
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.130
You can keep your credits for up to a year and use them for instance,

47
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:43.820
to binge on a whole series. If you like audible offers just about everything.

Hello, boys and girls, ladies and germs. This is Tim Ferriss.

62
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.710
Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show,

63
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.250
where it is usually my job to sit down with world class performers of all

64
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:46.300
different types, startup founders, investors, chess champions, Olympic athletes,

65
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:49.870
you name it to tease out that habits that you can apply in your own lives.

66
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.460
This episode, however,

67
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.470
is an experiment and part of a short form series that I'm doing simply called

68
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.640
books. I've loved. I've invited some amazing past guests,

69
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.940
close friends and new faces to share their favorite books.

70
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.490
Describe their favorite books. The books that have influenced them,

71
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.860
changed them, transform them for the better.

72
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.840
And I hope you pick up one or two new mentors in the form of books from this new

73
00:04:13.841 --> 00:04:16.000
series and apply the lessons in your own life.

74
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.210
I had a lot of fun putting this together,

75
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:23.830
inviting these people to participate and have learned so, so much myself.

76
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.890
I hope that is also the case for you. Please enjoy.

77
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.120
<v 2>Hi Tim Ferriss listeners. It's Whitney Cummings. Uh,</v>

78
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.620
thank you so much for letting me do this, Tim. Um, I'm only picking two books,

79
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.680
uh, because I just wanted to keep it kind of short and sweet.

80
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.900
The first one that I wanted to suggest is a book by Gavin de Becker.

81
00:04:45.901 --> 00:04:50.250
It's called the gift of fear, survival signals that protect us. Um,

82
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.270
it's a lot about, you know, stockers and violence and stuff like that,

83
00:04:54.271 --> 00:04:55.470
but there's, um,

84
00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.450
a lot of invaluable advice around hiring people and

85
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.070
drawing boundaries with people, vetting people, um,

86
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.810
for people that want to be highly productive for people that want to have their

87
00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:13.530
weekends off for people who want to have a drama free workplace for people who

88
00:05:13.531 --> 00:05:18.000
don't want to spend their time and emotional energy on difficult

89
00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:19.200
people. This is a,

90
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.330
this is a pretty transformative book in terms of

91
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.340
learning how to trust your gut and not dismiss red flags or write

92
00:05:29.341 --> 00:05:31.110
them off. You know, um,

93
00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.220
I spent a lot of time working with people that were exhausting,

94
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.370
egomaniacs, difficult people,

95
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.650
people who would be kind of a time suck in terms of managing their emotions or,

96
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.040
you know, people that interpreted constructive criticism as rejection.

97
00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:49.020
And then I felt like I had to take care of their feelings and,

98
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.860
and this and that. I mean, for someone that has those feelings,

99
00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:57.380
I also recommend Melanie Beatty's book, um, codependent no more.

100
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.640
And the adult child of alcoholics, big book, ACA big book. Um,

101
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.650
but if you've done that work and you know,

102
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:05.210
you're not being codependent in turns out,

103
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:06.890
someone's just being really difficult.

104
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.780
And this book is pretty wonderful for not dismissing your own gut instincts

105
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.060
because a lot of times when someone's difficult, you want to go, well,

106
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:17.750
I'm probably just being sensitive or I probably was too harsh,

107
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:19.400
or I probably should have handled it this way,

108
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:22.760
or I shouldn't have sent an email that was that direct when you start blaming

109
00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:27.110
yourself, um, there's a something I want to read to you.

110
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.220
Uh, so I can start getting more specific on one 23,

111
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:34.400
page one 23 of the gift of fear he writes.

112
00:06:34.401 --> 00:06:37.580
If you tell someone 10 times that you don't want to talk to him,

113
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.330
you are talking to him nine more times than you wanted to.

114
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.880
If you call him back after he leaves 20 messages,

115
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:48.080
you simply teach him the cost of getting a call back is 20 messages.

116
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.180
I love that because I don't think I understood that setting a

117
00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:57.440
boundary. Isn't always saying boundary, it's setting a boundary for yourself.

118
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.150
You know, if someone doesn't respect your boundary,

119
00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:00.500
you don't just keep setting the boundary.

120
00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:02.390
You just have to completely disengage with the person.

121
00:07:02.391 --> 00:07:05.720
If they don't have the emotional intelligence acumen or the ability to,

122
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.300
to read a situation in a way that's appropriate.

123
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.160
And it took me a long time to stop engaging in inappropriate behavior at the

124
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:15.440
workplace. For me, if some, if it was like,

125
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.860
I just have to spend an hour every day with this person to get them to act the

126
00:07:18.861 --> 00:07:22.910
way I want them to that's an hour more a day than I need to be spending with

127
00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:23.391
this person.

128
00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:27.140
So this book really helped me understand that sometimes the only way to win is

129
00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:29.510
to not play. Um, you know,

130
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:34.130
sometimes the best strategy is a masterful retreat when it comes to crazy

131
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:37.850
people that are just not able to take a hint. Um,

132
00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:40.880
so I highly recommend digging into that, uh, chapter.

133
00:07:40.881 --> 00:07:43.370
There's a great story about this, uh,

134
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.340
person who is at a workplace who was becoming a problem. And, um,

135
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.580
I highly recommend that I also earmarked, uh,

136
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.110
page one 58 for some reason. And Oh yes, I did. It's about, um,

137
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.730
references, uh, when you're working with people getting references, you know,

138
00:07:58.731 --> 00:08:02.380
I've made a lot of hiring mistakes because I tend to hire people because we get

139
00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:03.130
along really well.

140
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:07.330
We have really good chemistry or like this person's so funny or, you know,

141
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.070
we're both from DC or, you know,

142
00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:13.540
like we've all had those things where we want to hire someone that we actually

143
00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:16.420
should have just been friends with instead of someone we should actually be

144
00:08:16.421 --> 00:08:20.710
working with, you know, eight hours a day in high stakes situations. Um,

145
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.370
I've made this mistake before I used to never ask around about people.

146
00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:26.800
I used to never get references. I used to never call, like,

147
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.660
you'd see references on resume. You'd be like, Oh,

148
00:08:28.661 --> 00:08:33.220
well obviously if are numbers there that counts that's easy enough. I think,

149
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:37.690
you know, I like to now spend way more time hiring. Uh,

150
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.260
it helps me save time later in, in drama, frankly.

151
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.850
So on one 58,

152
00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:46.420
the failure to take the obvious step of calling references is an epidemic in

153
00:08:46.421 --> 00:08:46.960
America.

154
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.380
And I have little patience for managers who complain about employees that didn't

155
00:08:50.381 --> 00:08:54.070
care enough to assess before hiring a common excuse for this failure is the

156
00:08:54.071 --> 00:08:57.870
references will say only good things since the candidate has prepared them for

157
00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:58.890
the call. In fact,

158
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:01.860
there's a tremendous amount of information to be gained from references in terms

159
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:04.410
of confirming facts on an application.

160
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.050
Did you know him when he worked for such and such firm,

161
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.180
when did he work for such and such firm?

162
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.430
Do you know roughly what salary he was making?

163
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.180
Do you know what school he went to? You said you went to school with him.

164
00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:18.240
I suggested questions asked of those listed as references,

165
00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:20.700
be guided by information on the application.

166
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.640
The most important thing references can give you are other references.

167
00:09:23.641 --> 00:09:27.360
We call these people, develop sources. These are people who know the applicant,

168
00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:30.600
but whom he did not list as references accordingly,

169
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.840
they are not prepared for your inquiry and will be more likely to provide

170
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:35.010
valuable information.

171
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.730
You get the names of developed sources by asking the references,

172
00:09:38.731 --> 00:09:42.150
the applicant listed for the names of the people who know him.

173
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.510
I'm reading that now. And for some reason it sounds really hard to understand,

174
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.260
but it basically means as the references for other references.

175
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:53.640
So the people that weren't necessarily prepared for your call do research before

176
00:09:53.641 --> 00:09:57.330
you hire people the same way you would vet someone, you date someone, you marry,

177
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.450
someone you have in your home, that people that you work with.

178
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.570
It'll save you a lot of time and emotional energy in the long run,

179
00:10:03.571 --> 00:10:04.920
and you will be more prolific,

180
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:09.120
productive and happy on page two 82.

181
00:10:09.121 --> 00:10:11.730
There's a great section on public speaking. You know,

182
00:10:11.731 --> 00:10:14.700
a lot of people these days, if you're starting a business,

183
00:10:14.701 --> 00:10:18.720
if you want to be a performer, uh, if you want to be an entrepreneur,

184
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.440
you have to be able to speak in public. And I think even now,

185
00:10:22.441 --> 00:10:25.470
if you only want to be a behind the scenes business person, investor, whatever,

186
00:10:25.471 --> 00:10:28.050
you also have to speak at panels, you have to do Ted talks,

187
00:10:28.051 --> 00:10:30.630
you have to do a YouTube channel, you know, public speaking.

188
00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:35.040
Now isn't really optional, um, social media, YouTube.

189
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:38.190
So there's kind of a great section on that. Um,

190
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:41.520
and it's a section that's about like rules. Uh,

191
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:46.020
what you fear is rarely what you think you fear. It's what you linked to fear.

192
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.970
There's a whole section about fear in public speaking,

193
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.470
quote surveys have shown that ranking very close to the fear of death is the

194
00:10:52.471 --> 00:10:53.610
fear of public speaking.

195
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.420
Why would someone feel profound fear deep in his or her stomach about public

196
00:10:57.421 --> 00:10:57.811
speaking,

197
00:10:57.811 --> 00:11:02.190
which is so far from death because it isn't so far from death when we link it.

198
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:03.840
Those who fear public speaking,

199
00:11:03.841 --> 00:11:07.830
actually fear the loss of identity that attaches to performing badly.

200
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.660
And that is firmly rooted in our survival needs for all social animals from ants

201
00:11:12.661 --> 00:11:13.351
to antelopes.

202
00:11:13.351 --> 00:11:17.420
Identity is the past card to inclusion and inclusion is the key to survival.

203
00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.640
If a baby loses its identity as the child of its parents,

204
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:25.140
a possible outcome is abandonment for human infant. That means death as adults,

205
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.830
without identity, as a member of the tribe or village community or culture,

206
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.200
a likely outcome is banishment and death.

207
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.830
So fear of getting up and addressing 500 people at the annual convention of

208
00:11:34.831 --> 00:11:37.710
professionals in your field is not just the fear of embarrassment.

209
00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:40.050
It's linked to the fear of being perceived as incompetent,

210
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.680
which is linked to the fear of loss of employment, loss of home, loss of family,

211
00:11:43.681 --> 00:11:46.560
your ability to contribute to society, your value in short,

212
00:11:46.561 --> 00:11:47.550
your identity in your life,

213
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.360
linking an unwarranted fear as the ultimate terrible destination that usually

214
00:11:51.361 --> 00:11:52.530
helps alleviate that fear.

215
00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.060
Then you may find that public speaking can link to death.

216
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:59.740
You'll see that that would be a long and unlikely trip. Just a really great,

217
00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.890
uh, chapter on fear and, um,

218
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.120
public speaking and sort of how we link things in our brains. And, uh,

219
00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.710
that stuff just fascinates me.

220
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:11.740
And I think is really important for anyone that wants to be, um,

221
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.960
successful quite frankly. Um,

222
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:16.510
so highly recommend the gift of fear by Gavin de Becker.

223
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:20.680
The second book I'm going to recommend is a title that I just

224
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.770
hardly can say out loud. It's so embarrassing,

225
00:12:23.771 --> 00:12:26.200
but it is such an incredible book. It is called getting the love.

226
00:12:26.201 --> 00:12:27.820
You want a guide.

227
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.400
<v 3>For couples? I can't even say it without laughing.</v>

228
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.940
<v 2>Um, I remember when I first bought this book, I had to do it in person.</v>

229
00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:36.790
It was like kind of before Amazon and I went to Barnes and noble back when that

230
00:12:36.791 --> 00:12:40.090
was a store and I went up to the guy and I was like,

231
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:42.250
can I get this book it's called getting the love?

232
00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:45.610
Like I had to whisper it in the bookstore. I was so embarrassed to say it.

233
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.260
And then he said it over the loud speaker.

234
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.040
Who's like getting the love you want I'll too. It was very embarrassing,

235
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.900
but the book is so unbelievable.

236
00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:56.080
It's by Harville Hendrix and Helen Kelly Lee hunt. I mean,

237
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.920
Harville Hendrix is really famous for developing a Mago therapy.

238
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:03.790
And before I read a chapter to you, I think, you know,

239
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.350
I talk about this a lot,

240
00:13:05.351 --> 00:13:08.320
but I think that the relationship you're in is a business decision.

241
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:12.190
I know most of Tim Ferris's listeners are chiming in for great business advice,

242
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:13.450
productivity advice,

243
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:17.200
the person you choose to be your partner is a business decision,

244
00:13:17.201 --> 00:13:21.370
the amount of money that you're, um, you know, saving depends on that person,

245
00:13:21.371 --> 00:13:24.220
the amount of time you're putting in your business depends on that, that choice,

246
00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:27.490
the amount of emotional energy that you have depends on that choice,

247
00:13:27.491 --> 00:13:28.990
the amount of support you get. You know,

248
00:13:28.991 --> 00:13:31.540
I feel very strongly that in order to be, you know,

249
00:13:31.541 --> 00:13:35.080
brave and take risks in your professional life, you have to have a very stable,

250
00:13:35.081 --> 00:13:39.730
safe, supportive, personal life. So I'm a big fan of, um,

251
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:44.230
anyone that wants to achieve wildly astronomical

252
00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:45.580
goals. Uh,

253
00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:49.780
you have to make sure that your home is in order as well and that your heart is

254
00:13:49.781 --> 00:13:51.190
in order. Um,

255
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.280
I think it's important that anybody that wants to be successful in any part of

256
00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:56.830
their lives understands neurology and neurochemistry.

257
00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:59.560
You guys have heard me blather on about this, um,

258
00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.020
on page 45 of getting the love you want,

259
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.140
what causes the rush of good feelings that we all call romantic love.

260
00:14:05.141 --> 00:14:08.020
Scientists who study natural hormones and chemicals tell us that lovers are

261
00:14:08.021 --> 00:14:11.920
literally high on drugs substances that flood their bodies with a sense of

262
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:14.170
wellbeing during the attraction phase of a relationship,

263
00:14:14.171 --> 00:14:17.080
the brain releases more dopamine and norepinephrine.

264
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:18.640
Two of the body's neuro-transmitters.

265
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.400
These chemicals help contribute to a rosy outlook on life.

266
00:14:21.401 --> 00:14:25.030
A rapid pulse increased energy, and a sense of heightened perception.

267
00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.030
Oxytocin is enhanced as well as a potent hormone.

268
00:14:28.031 --> 00:14:31.540
That plays a role in many aspects of our lives, including childbirth, nursing,

269
00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:32.380
orgasm,

270
00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:36.250
and bonding of mother and child and social connections between individuals,

271
00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:39.820
some refer to it as the love sex hormone during the phase when lovers want to be

272
00:14:39.821 --> 00:14:41.320
together. Every moment of the day,

273
00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:43.720
the brain also ramps up its production of endorphins,

274
00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.980
natural narcotics that enhance the sense of security and comfort. Um,

275
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:49.660
you guys might know this on some level,

276
00:14:49.661 --> 00:14:53.840
but I think it's really important that people understand that, you know,

277
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:57.710
being in love, being attracted to somebody, being in a new, intense,

278
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.640
passionate relationship, you're literally high on drugs. Uh,

279
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.840
it can be a huge distraction to your work life, um, if it ends up lasting,

280
00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:08.480
that's great, but for the most part I've worked, you know,

281
00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:10.880
a lot of people ask me, uh, how do you do work so hard?

282
00:15:10.881 --> 00:15:14.120
How do you save so much time? I really try to limit the amount of, uh,

283
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.810
in my past, um, rampant love affairs,

284
00:15:17.811 --> 00:15:20.360
because most of it is just neurochemicals.

285
00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:24.620
Not everyone is the one and that's okay. But I think the, um, really intense,

286
00:15:24.621 --> 00:15:27.290
passionate relationships can be a giant distraction, um,

287
00:15:27.291 --> 00:15:30.890
ultimately from the goals that you want to achieve.

288
00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:34.340
So I always think it's important that people really understand, you know,

289
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.710
cause you can meet someone and then lose four months of your life to someone

290
00:15:36.711 --> 00:15:37.940
that you're like, I don't even like that person.

291
00:15:37.941 --> 00:15:41.390
I was just high on neurochemicals. That was a big waste of time.

292
00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:45.080
So I think that, you know, we learn something from every relationship we're in,

293
00:15:45.081 --> 00:15:45.740
but, um,

294
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:50.630
I see a lot of people's careers suffering because they get distracted

295
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:55.580
by relationships that ultimately don't yield that much and lessons that

296
00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:59.720
they quite frankly don't need to learn. Um, page 73, uh,

297
00:15:59.721 --> 00:16:04.670
there's a great chapter on the stages of a power struggle in a relationship. Um,

298
00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.590
when you and your partner are immersed in a power struggle,

299
00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:08.900
you have a little sense of when it all started or how it will end,

300
00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:12.230
but from an outside perspective, the power struggle has predictable course.

301
00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:16.010
One that parallels the well-documented stages of grief in a bereaved person.

302
00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:17.720
I'm not going to read that whole chapter to you,

303
00:16:17.721 --> 00:16:22.220
but that's a really interesting one. Um, and then on page one 15,

304
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:23.450
uh,

305
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:28.250
there's a big chapter on empathizing and being able to see your partner's inner

306
00:16:28.251 --> 00:16:29.900
world to understand, you know,

307
00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:33.140
cause sometimes we say something and it's not received the way we intend it to

308
00:16:33.141 --> 00:16:36.380
be received and we get so confused. How can they not understand we're saying,

309
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.490
because they're seeing it through the lens of their own experience, trauma, uh,

310
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.210
parenting and neurology. So there's a great, uh,

311
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.190
exercise on how to empathize with your partner.

312
00:16:46.191 --> 00:16:50.120
And when you're in a disagreement, you repeat what the other person says.

313
00:16:50.121 --> 00:16:53.270
It's a pretty great exercise. Um, because you know,

314
00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.370
how often are we in relationships?

315
00:16:55.371 --> 00:16:58.340
And we say something and the other person completely contorts it and twist it.

316
00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.390
And you're like, that's not what I said.

317
00:16:59.391 --> 00:17:03.680
And then you start fighting about fighting. Uh,

318
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:06.500
you're not even I'm finding about the thing you might be like,

319
00:17:06.501 --> 00:17:08.450
what were you in fighting about? Uh,

320
00:17:08.451 --> 00:17:13.400
so what you do to minimize the amount of time that you're in one of these

321
00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:15.770
altercations or power struggles, um,

322
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.490
if I say I'm uncomfortable that you showed up late and the other person has to

323
00:17:19.491 --> 00:17:23.060
say, I hear that you're uncomfortable that I showed up late, but this,

324
00:17:23.061 --> 00:17:26.600
this and this. And then I have to go, well, I hear that this, this and this,

325
00:17:26.601 --> 00:17:27.620
but you know,

326
00:17:27.621 --> 00:17:30.440
so you have to mirror what the other person says so that you're actually having

327
00:17:30.441 --> 00:17:34.220
a productive conversation that just doesn't turn into, you know, uh,

328
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.570
your childhood circumstances and, and trauma responses clashing, um,

329
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:41.690
and being a ultimately complete waste of time because I know Tim Ferriss

330
00:17:41.691 --> 00:17:45.830
listeners are very possessive, uh, about their precious time.

331
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:51.690
Um, this book is a lot how we are attracted to people that have the

332
00:17:51.691 --> 00:17:55.020
negative qualities of our primary caretakers. Um,

333
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.490
I find that to be incredibly important information just to know that that is how

334
00:17:59.491 --> 00:18:03.510
we lean in general, our brains want to, um,

335
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:07.770
finish unfinished business in our work life and our professional life.

336
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:08.731
In our friendships.

337
00:18:08.731 --> 00:18:12.270
We tend to be attracted to people who have the negative qualities of our primary

338
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.200
caretaker. So when you're going out on dates, when you're selecting a mate,

339
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.730
when you're selecting friends, when you're hiring employees, uh,

340
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.140
it's important that you understand that that is going to be what we're attracted

341
00:18:25.141 --> 00:18:25.441
to.

342
00:18:25.441 --> 00:18:29.550
And often when we're attracted to the people that have the negative qualities

343
00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.410
are our primary caretakers, uh,

344
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:35.400
it turns into this thing that we've been marketed as being called chemistry.

345
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.100
I have great chemistry with that person,

346
00:18:38.101 --> 00:18:42.240
but it really could just be your inner child going mom is that you

347
00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.860
dad does. And then we end up just having our inner child run the show.

348
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.080
And for the most part, um,

349
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.170
the people I end up working with are not the people that I have amazing

350
00:18:52.171 --> 00:18:56.550
chemistry with necessarily. It's the people that hear me when I say something,

351
00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:00.090
uh, have direct, clear communication. Uh,

352
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:02.550
the people that you work with do not have to be the people you hang out with all

353
00:19:02.551 --> 00:19:04.800
the time and text with all day. Um,

354
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:08.670
you don't have to be besties with the people you work with. I think, uh, um,

355
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.210
between these two books, it's a really good way to make sort of emotion free,

356
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:16.740
clear logical hiring, uh, and partnering,

357
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.520
uh, decisions so that you're acting from your brain and not your heart.

358
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:23.520
And so your inner child's not running the show. So again,

359
00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.290
I recommended Melanie Beatty.

360
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:29.220
Co-dependence no more getting the love you want from Harville Hendrix and the

361
00:19:29.221 --> 00:19:33.030
gift of fear survival signals that protect us by Gavin de Becker.

362
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.780
<v 4>Hey guys, this is Tim again, just a few more things before you take off.</v>

363
00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.660
Number one, this is five bullet Friday.

364
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:44.990
Do you want to get a short email from me?

365
00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:49.160
Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a

366
00:19:49.161 --> 00:19:52.730
little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very

367
00:19:52.731 --> 00:19:57.050
short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been

368
00:19:57.051 --> 00:19:58.370
pondering over the week.

369
00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:02.030
That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered it could include

370
00:20:02.031 --> 00:20:07.010
gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird that I've somehow dug up in the,

371
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:09.140
uh, the world of the esoteric as I do.

372
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:14.270
It could include favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared

373
00:20:14.271 --> 00:20:17.780
with my close friends, for instance. And it's very short.

374
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:22.820
It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend.

375
00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.070
So if you want to receive that, check it out,
