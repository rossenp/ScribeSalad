00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.930
<v 0>Oh, dusk quick Chinese lesson, just for fun.</v>

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.360
This is a character for peace, right?

3
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:10.650
So that is

4
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.150
[inaudible]. Okay. So that is pronounced this way.

5
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.700
Second tongue ping, UN, okay.

6
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.990
This means level or even,

7
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.880
so if you had say pink June, if you had pink, June,

8
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.840
June is, would be this character a little sloppy,

9
00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:42.650
but you get the idea June. That would be average. Okay.

10
00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:45.110
Like the average the mean, okay, so pink,

11
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.960
June ping UN is peace.

12
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.880
And just to show you how this character is

13
00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:56.390
constructed, some people will love this. Some people won't, but this is a roof,

14
00:00:56.391 --> 00:00:58.850
this radical on the top, and this is a woman underneath.

15
00:00:58.851 --> 00:01:03.830
So a woman under a roof in a home means peace or peaceful,

16
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.000
and you can construct other characters really easily using the second one.

17
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.640
Just to give you an idea. So you might have, for instance,

18
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.200
that's boom, it's a little sloppy,

19
00:01:15.201 --> 00:01:19.010
but you get the idea on which means public.

20
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.073
Uh,

21
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.930
and it means so public safety, public security,

22
00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:30.800
that's also kind of a police officer. All right. So,

23
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.020
and then you could have own UN [inaudible] park. All right.

24
00:01:36.021 --> 00:01:38.030
So you got public peace.

25
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.980
You have sort of even peace means at peace.

26
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.350
No. Cause for worry, et cetera.

27
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.790
Hope that is interesting to some of you have a beautiful day.
