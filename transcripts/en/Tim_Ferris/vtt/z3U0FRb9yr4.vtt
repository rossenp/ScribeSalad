00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.350
<v 0>All right, this is on how to negotiate or the art of deal-making,</v>

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.070
whether you like it or not, you are a salesperson.

3
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:12.930
You're going to be persuading others to buy into your ideas, your services,

4
00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:15.540
your product, your career path,

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.950
investing in you in some capacity, you need to learn how to persuade.

6
00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:24.330
So we'll talk about a few different techniques that I use routinely for

7
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.420
negotiating, which isn't exactly the same as persuasion.

8
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.430
If you're interested in the general broad scope of persuasion and influence,

9
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:36.510
I highly recommend you pick up the book influence by Robert Cialdini or

10
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:38.610
Cialdini. I'm not sure how it is pronounced,

11
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:41.490
but that is a classic that I read many,

12
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:44.070
many times at the very beginning of my career and found very, very helpful.

13
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.000
Getting into negotiating a few things to keep in mind, mantra.

14
00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:51.870
Number one is he or she who cares the least wins.

15
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.850
So having options is very helpful for giving you that type of confidence,

16
00:00:56.851 --> 00:01:01.770
walkaway power. The other is doing an exercise called fear setting so that the

17
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.080
downsides of losing the negotiation are D tooth in

18
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:07.470
a way.

19
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.360
And you can find out more about fear setting@tim.blog Ford slash Ted had an

20
00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:14.850
entire Ted talk on this. So I won't spend time on it right now,

21
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.080
a few things when it comes to negotiating a price, a deal structuring,

22
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:21.930
et cetera, the first is that you want the counterparty,

23
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:26.250
the person that you're negotiating with to negotiate against themselves first,

24
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.200
how do you do that? If possible? I like to ask them to make the first offer,

25
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.290
put something on the table to get the ball rolling,

26
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.510
or to initiate the conversation.

27
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.860
And very often you'll be interacting with someone who you can position as the

28
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:43.800
expert. You know, more about this than I do. You've done this a hundred times.

29
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.030
This is my first rodeo.

30
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.730
Why don't you just put something on the table so that we can discuss it as a

31
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:48.450
starting point?

32
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.220
That is in my experience very often more beneficial than it is

33
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.760
harmful. Sometimes they will try to anchor that is giving you a very,

34
00:01:56.761 --> 00:01:59.220
very high ball price or a very, very low ball price,

35
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:02.100
depending on if they're on the sell side or the buy side.

36
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.720
But generally speaking,

37
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.560
I like to get the other side to open up and show their initial hand.

38
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.770
At that point you can do, what's called a flinch.

39
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.890
And when I lived in China and Beijing in 96,

40
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.050
I saw this all the time where you'd go to buy a shirt or a phone

41
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:20.490
charger or whatever it might be,

42
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.330
and you would offer a price and then the woman selling it would go

43
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.930
and make all these faces and contortions. And so on.

44
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.550
She did that very deliberately to get me to then back off or retract or

45
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:33.570
backstep right.

46
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.640
You don't have to make some type of extreme theatrical to accomplish this.

47
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.400
You could just pause and go. Hmm. You know, that's,

48
00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:44.460
that's a bit more than I would have expected and then wait.

49
00:02:44.461 --> 00:02:46.140
And the waiting is the hardest.

50
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.860
So if you can develop the ability to sit in silence,

51
00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:52.470
you will have a tremendous advantage in negotiating.

52
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.620
So you want to flinch in some fashion first. Wow.

53
00:02:55.621 --> 00:02:58.920
That's a lot higher than I would have expected then perhaps they backpedal,

54
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.710
which happens a lot, especially with novice or intermediate negotiators.

55
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.940
And then you can very simply ask, is that the best that you can do?

56
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:10.570
Do you think this is the best that you guys can offer? And again,

57
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.310
pause and wait, when you want to get into some of the more, I suppose,

58
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.300
fisticuffs or develop techniques in negotiating different types of bracketing,

59
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.980
how to make certain concessions,

60
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:25.510
how to drill into what they want the needs behind their requests.

61
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.730
So they want a certain price, but what are the incentives?

62
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.700
Are they trying to hit a quota? Do they want to, for instance,

63
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.480
be remembered in some fashion or retain branding,

64
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:37.960
maybe a statue in front of the shopping center would do instead of them getting

65
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:40.930
top dollar on the shopping center, you're trying to buy something like that.

66
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.460
There are resources that can help with these types of more advanced techniques.

67
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.090
Uh, one would be Roger Dawson, secrets of power negotiating.

68
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.660
I listened to that in audio format. It is available in audio.

69
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:54.490
I don't know the quality these days,

70
00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:59.290
but I listened to that driving to and from work during my commute in

71
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:02.470
2000, 2001. And if I remember correctly,

72
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:05.680
Roger made his first fortune in real estate.

73
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.350
And I found it very, very helpful. And particularly only in audio.

74
00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:13.140
So I could hear it inflection, how he delivered certain phrases,

75
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.040
asked certain questions. The other book is getting past no,

76
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.730
and the author, or at least coauthors William Ury,

77
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.590
U R Y getting past no was a follow-up to getting

78
00:04:25.591 --> 00:04:26.340
to yes,

79
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.390
which was a book co-authored by the founders of the Harvard negotiation project.

80
00:04:30.391 --> 00:04:33.300
I believe it is one of which is William Ury,

81
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.350
but getting past no is I think the more pragmatic,

82
00:04:37.351 --> 00:04:42.240
realistic way to phrase many of your experiences in the world of

83
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.961
negotiating,

84
00:04:42.961 --> 00:04:46.290
you're going to be either trying to sell something that isn't immediately

85
00:04:46.291 --> 00:04:47.250
obvious to someone,

86
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.930
or you're going to be trying to buy something at a price or with a structure

87
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.440
that isn't immediately obviously appealing to someone.

88
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.120
Otherwise it's not negotiating.

89
00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.910
You simply put something on the table and you sell it or you buy it.

90
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.810
The other facet of negotiating is avoiding it altogether.

91
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.970
And that sort of leads to this,

92
00:05:05.971 --> 00:05:09.570
which is you can structure your life to avoid certain types of negotiation.

93
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.710
In the case of say my podcast and podcast sponsorship of a very lean team of

94
00:05:13.711 --> 00:05:14.550
just a few people,

95
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.770
and we want to avoid altogether the extreme back and forth that can be involved

96
00:05:19.771 --> 00:05:21.690
with ad purchasing or selling.

97
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.160
This is very routine and podcasts size of mine very often have staff of 20,

98
00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:30.540
30 people and agencies and all sorts of folks involved to avoid that.

99
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.670
We decided that we would have everyone pre-pay. There are no payment terms,

100
00:05:35.671 --> 00:05:38.940
no net 30 or anything like that. We did not offer any discounts,

101
00:05:38.941 --> 00:05:41.820
still don't offer any discounts. And we would charge a premium.

102
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.910
The way you get a discount is by locking in today's pricing.

103
00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:48.150
Because with the rate of growth we expected with the podcast,

104
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.420
the absolute pricing would always go up, not the CPM.

105
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.770
And so there are ways that you can set policies and systems in place in the

106
00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:59.360
beginning so that you do not have to expend many,

107
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:03.650
many cycles of negotiating to pull that off, though, in the case of the podcast,

108
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.610
you have to deliver very, very high amounts of traffic with high conversion,

109
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.260
right? So that in a sense, forces you to deliver a higher quality product.

110
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.390
And I always find that the premium space or selling to the affluent,

111
00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:20.660
if you want to take a look at that book to be much,

112
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:25.550
much easier than negotiating with players who are looking for the

113
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:27.380
lowest cost option.

114
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.330
So those are a few approaches to deal making and negotiating and

115
00:06:32.331 --> 00:06:35.690
structuring different approaches to putting together,

116
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.870
say packages for buying or selling that I found useful.

117
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:39.800
And I hope you do as well.
