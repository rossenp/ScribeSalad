1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 0>Have either of you been ever good at like bartering or, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.470
like I've learned to do it just because my dad was really good at it.

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.300
Like I suck at it. This is why I love Japan,

4
00:00:11.301 --> 00:00:15.230
where everything is labeled and price. Because whenever I go to Thailand,

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.800
you just, you just play this dance around everything you buy, man.

6
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.480
It is a dance where you're just like, Oh, okay. So you're gonna, you're gonna,

7
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.390
you're gonna charge me that. Well, I'm gonna like say a price.

8
00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:29.900
That's 10 times lower in Australia. It's like a dance that you will only dance.

9
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.580
If you decide to enter, it's like, you can stand back and just kind of be like,

10
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.890
Oh, this is how much you want. All right. Then pull your wallet out.

11
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.890
But then you could also be like, hold on, let me roll up my sleeves real quick.

12
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.740
Let's sound. But baby, think it's like,

13
00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:47.240
my dad was so cause my dad's has it been like an it salesman for positive load?

14
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.250
He is. So this man, I don't know how the he did it,

15
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.390
but I remember like when I was in like a high school,

16
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.880
something and I wanted to buy my first guitar,

17
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.780
like a proper electric guitar and that he bought me like this like really nice

18
00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:03.050
Epiphone guitar, which is worth like two grand or something. Yeah.

19
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.840
And he looked at it and he's like, so this is just the guitar. Right.

20
00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:10.010
And the guy's like, yeah. It's like, can I have a chat with you mate? And any,

21
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:13.280
any talks the dude, but like back behind, like the kind of inter room.

22
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.530
And he's like, hold on son. I'm just gonna beat him up in the back.

23
00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:20.510
Why can't he do it at the counter? I don't know. I don't know.

24
00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:22.310
But he like talking to the bag. He was like, all right, let me talk.

25
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.240
And then I think, I think maybe like 10 minutes later, he came out,

26
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.430
he came out, he came out 10 minutes later and he's like, all right.

27
00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:38.680
So the guitar now is 1500 any throw in a free amp. And I'm like, Whoa,

28
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.650
what did you say? What did you, what did you do? How did you do it? He's like,

29
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.590
I just talked to him mate. I'm like, no, no, no, no. Not like,

30
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.010
if it was that easy, then everyone would be getting deals.

31
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.470
It's it's not just a matter of, Oh, I just talked to him, like what,

32
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.080
what did you say to him? Where everyone can feel? I was like, I was like,

33
00:01:57.081 --> 00:02:01.490
what did you say? Jedi mind trick. Was it like, that's technically isn't it?

34
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.850
Did you like inception? Like plant the seed and he's just like, it's 1500 now.

35
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.760
<v 1>The first time I ever saw like bartering happened, I was like,</v>

36
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:10.790
my mind was blown. I was like, wait, you can go against the price.

37
00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:11.870
That's written. Yeah.

38
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.880
<v 0>That's an option. So it wasn't.</v>

39
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.950
<v 1>Like we were on a school trip to New York.</v>

40
00:02:15.951 --> 00:02:18.410
It was like the first time our school ever like went to a different country.

41
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.070
And um, I really wanted to go to New York for school. Yeah, dude. It was chaos.

42
00:02:22.071 --> 00:02:26.600
It was pure. How old were you? Ah, 16. I think.

43
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.820
Oh my God. Wow. He was an absolute mess, bro.

44
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.900
<v 0>Really? The only school trips I went to was just like France at most.</v>

45
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.520
That was the firms that I've ever gone to.

46
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.150
<v 1>Bougiest one, if for some reason, for one year they never did it again.</v>

47
00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:40.760
I think they realized it was a horrible mistake. It took us to New York.

48
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.030
It was a mess. It was awful. It was like, I mean,

49
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.840
if I was a teacher that would have hated it, I had a great time. But yeah,

50
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.920
it was, I remember it was very expensive, but um,

51
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.350
we stayed in like really sketchy motels.

52
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.040
I can talk about it more after the story, but we were, we were basically like,

53
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.010
I really wanted converse because obviously when you're like 15, 16,

54
00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.220
you see the and like American, you like yo Hong Kong.

55
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.420
So I went to the store and my friend was with me and he was only,

56
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:06.910
he was in the year above me. And I was like, man, I want to get these.

57
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:09.700
But I've only got like 30 bucks left and that 40 bucks, he was like, Oh, I'll,

58
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.360
I'll ask him if we can do it for 30. He's like 17 bartering with him.

59
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.290
And then eventually he said, I'll give you for 30. If you give me a $2 tip.

60
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.630
And I'm like, is that okay? Are you allowed to do that?

61
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:22.300
I don't know if he's the owner of law, but that's what he got it down to.

62
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:25.630
And I was so impressed when I went home to the UK. I tried to do it,

63
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:27.100
but immediately all the stores are like.

64
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.260
<v 0>No, wait, what stores I'd go to?</v>

65
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.000
Like in America or the UK in America [inaudible] store.

66
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.290
I think it was like in a mall.

67
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.600
<v 1>It's like an independent store. Maybe. I think that's why I got away with it.</v>

68
00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:42.530
So I went to like a supermarket in the UK, go to the thing.

69
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:43.650
<v 0>I'm going to test</v>

70
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.870
five pounds and a little too much for this [inaudible] you're selling me this

71
00:03:48.871 --> 00:03:53.070
Kellogg's Krispy. Kremes for like how much I'll be like, you know,

72
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.350
it's a little, three pounds, a little expensive, two 50. I'll do 50 50.

73
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.720
<v 1>No, no, no. I'm like, Oh, okay. that. I've never tried it again for awhile,</v>

74
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.060
but I like going to places where you can do it. Cause I like,

75
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.040
I like trying to do it. I don't know.

76
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.900
<v 0>I don't, I don't, I don't know how,</v>

77
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.380
like I probably could do it if I really wanted to,

78
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.780
but I'm always just so afraid to do it as well. Cause I don't know how like, um,

79
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.040
I don't know. Cause with that kind of stuff,

80
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.380
if you're not coming in with confidence, you're basically.

81
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.300
There's no way you're going to win it.

82
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.420
You need to come in with like a winning mentality coming in with like the

83
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.860
biggest Dick energy. I'm like, I can do it. It just takes so much energy.

84
00:04:31.861 --> 00:04:34.050
But whenever in a you're in a place like Thailand,

85
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.940
that's like 90% of the stores you go to and you just want a store where you pay

86
00:04:38.941 --> 00:04:43.320
the price that the originally asked for and just not have to like do this mini

87
00:04:43.321 --> 00:04:44.190
game every time.

88
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.450
<v 1>I remember I watched like the,</v>

89
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.540
I think I mentioned him on the YouTube rep series.

90
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.450
He just videos about Prague covers like taxi scams.

91
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.450
I was in Prague and I had a taxi and I was like,

92
00:04:54.451 --> 00:04:57.240
this is like in the simulations, this is exactly what he spoke about.

93
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.460
Cause they were trying to charge her. What he said was being overcharged.

94
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.400
I remember I was with my maintenance taxi. I'm like, no,

95
00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:03.540
no I've seen the YouTube video. I've got this. That I was like,

96
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.190
I'm not paying that. That's too much.

97
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.530
But eventually we got to like half the price. It was wow.

98
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.990
You're supposed to be like, he like 50 euros for like, uh,

99
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.800
the equivalent in check money for like, um,

100
00:05:13.801 --> 00:05:17.310
like it was supposed to be like half that it was like only like a 20 minute,

101
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.820
like 15 minute journey where I was like, no, I've seen the simulations.

102
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.170
I know this is right.

103
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.350
And there's YouTube channels of dudes who go around India like bartering.

104
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.513
Oh yeah.

105
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.230
<v 0>I can imagine bartering in India is just like next level. That's like,</v>

106
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.230
that's like expert mode, man. That's literally isn't it looks like.

107
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.470
<v 1>A reality TV show with every purchase. The guy's like I'm walking away.</v>

108
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.050
I'm going, I'm not getting in your taxi. And then they're like.

109
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:43.530
<v 0>[Inaudible] please, sir.</v>
