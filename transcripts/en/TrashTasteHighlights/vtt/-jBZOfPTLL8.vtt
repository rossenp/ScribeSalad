1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>I was watching, um, who's that really famous, uh,</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.300
comedy and also director guy in Japan.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.560
He's always on that billboard and should be, Oh,

4
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.200
I saw him and he was on Japanese TV and he was reacting to this thing and he was

5
00:00:12.201 --> 00:00:13.530
like LGBT stuff.

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.310
He had never seen such minimal reaction in my life.

7
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.890
He was like a bulldog just like that.

8
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.620
And then it cut to a guy in an onset giggling and he was like, nah.

9
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.560
And I was like, well, I think I know what he likes.

10
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.920
I don't care for this nonsense. Get that off. You know, it was just,

11
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.813
it was just funny.

12
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.590
Like Y Y there's like eight hosts and they refuse to take the camera off him.

13
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.101
It was just,

14
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:41.490
let's keep it like you see those at the point where he doesn't give a,

15
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.300
as long as he's on the show, people, it doesn't matter. It's just a non-branded.

16
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.670
So do you wanna explain to the audience who.

17
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.540
<v 1>Well, talk to your beat? Takeshi has his cold cashews.</v>

18
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.870
Casa is he's found a Turkish issues castle, and this one then comes from,

19
00:00:53.871 --> 00:00:58.820
but originally he was a Japanese comedian and he's basically the reason why the

20
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.430
whole is crazy. All right. What are you doing?

21
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.010
I'm trying to talk about you. I drink this up anyway.

22
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.280
I mean, anyway, so yeah, so he was like,

23
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.510
he basically founded the whole Japanese comedy scene back in the seventies.

24
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.010
And he's the big reason why there's no comedy, not in Tokyo,

25
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.560
no jokes allowed. No. So in the soap he invented.

26
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.063
Okay. So,

27
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.540
so in, in, so the whole idea of like months I stand up comedy,

28
00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:38.750
which is a very like Japanese form of standup comedy where it's like, you know,

29
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.880
one right. giggling and everything. It's like,

30
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.380
it's like SIM it's just shut off for a second. Just like,

31
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.260
it's basically like the whole it's called Monza, which is like,

32
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.000
there's usually one mic in the middle.

33
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:55.760
And two people standing in front of the one mic, you know,

34
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.260
doing a whole comedy routine.

35
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.150
And that was really big in all soccer or like in Kansai region and the standup

36
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:05.510
company. Well, yeah, it's a little bit different to just stand up comedy.

37
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.050
Cause a lot of standup comedy, at least in the West is usually like one person.

38
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.981
Yeah. Right.

39
00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:13.490
Like it's just one person kind of telling an anecdote and then throwing a joke

40
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.510
within the anecdote. Like that's very general standup comedy,

41
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.730
but Monza is kind of like that.

42
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.780
But if you split the anecdote and the jokes into two different people,

43
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.000
so basically there's one guy who sets up the joke and then there's one guy froze

44
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:29.691
the punchline.

45
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:33.920
And then the guy who sets up the joke reacts to the joke and it's that whole

46
00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:37.700
dynamic, is it like two person rocket go essentially. Yeah.

47
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.020
So like Rocco is more similar to Western standup company in that sense because

48
00:02:42.021 --> 00:02:44.810
the doc who goes all about like telling an anecdote and then throwing it a

49
00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:46.850
punchline at the end, Rutger just seems like style.

50
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.610
<v 0>Up comedy hard mode because like imagine standup comedy,</v>

51
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.090
but you have to sit in this one place and you can't move and you have limited

52
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.350
body movements. Right?

53
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.880
<v 1>Exactly. But like Rocky goes like,</v>

54
00:02:55.881 --> 00:02:59.740
so ancient in Japan has been doing it since like, I even know how long,

55
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:01.120
but it's very, very often with comedy,

56
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:06.010
but basically the whole Munsey type of comedy really originally started in

57
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:07.300
like the fifties and sixties

58
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.350
[inaudible] but basically, yeah,

59
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.990
that was only really a scene that existed in Osaka.

60
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.980
And that's why like a lot of comedic I do,

61
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.460
I've noticed they all speak in concert dialect. All right. And, but uh,

62
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.770
how Kashi and his group, he was in a,

63
00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:30.600
he was in a duo to beetle and he was basically the first like really

64
00:03:30.601 --> 00:03:33.300
big Monza act to make it big in the Tokyo scene.

65
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.490
And it was because of his success that Monzo moved to Tokyo as

66
00:03:38.491 --> 00:03:39.900
well and like the Tokyo area.

67
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.930
So that's why he's kind of just known as like a legend. Yeah.

68
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.530
He's basically the godfather of like Tokyo moms active

69
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.330
fireworks. Yeah. They put me in ghost to the show movie,

70
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.790
the dudes done everything. Like he like paints,

71
00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:56.130
he directs he's like he developed his own game.

72
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.790
Was he in the original battle Royale as well? Of course.

73
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.310
That was one of his biggest roles. Yeah. He's pretty good on that.

74
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.620
He's really good. He's a great actor. Yeah. He's a very good,

75
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.770
I'm just eating chicken and broccoli and not achieving anything.

76
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.990
Where's your mom. Where's my mind.

77
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.130
I didn't realize he was a comedian that's because I already know him as like an

78
00:04:14.131 --> 00:04:16.440
actor director. It's quite weird. Cause he's this comedian,

79
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.620
but he's also this incredibly stoic. Very, I noticed that. Yeah.

80
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.000
He's very like, not, I can't imagine him being a comedian because every,

81
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:28.680
in every film he's played, he's like super serious Briar. Right, right.

82
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.410
Like you watch, you watch like old,

83
00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:35.100
like seventies footage of him while he was still in Subito and he's just the

84
00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:35.341
most,

85
00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:38.880
he was actually the guy who was like responsible for like telling the bot of the

86
00:04:38.881 --> 00:04:42.360
joke. So he was always the like kind of on the ground, on the shark. Right.

87
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.180
So it's really weird now watching like ghost in the shell,

88
00:04:45.181 --> 00:04:48.600
what's in this light hot face. Seriously? Yes I am the bad-ass in this. Yeah.

89
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.530
Just go around and be like, I'm the clown. It's just, I don't know.

90
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.510
I find it really cool that you like the movie likes a strong word.

91
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.970
I guess those. I can't wait, what movie are you talking about on the show?

92
00:05:02.971 --> 00:05:06.600
Live action. I liked it as. I liked it.

93
00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:09.840
If it wasn't a ghost in the show movie, why is it, Chris?

94
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.000
[inaudible] original animated film, but that's what I'm saying.

95
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.990
As a ghost in the shell movie, it was really bad, but so just a standalone,

96
00:05:18.991 --> 00:05:22.740
like scifi movie. It was okay. I thought it was,

97
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.310
I literally walked out of the theater. Really? Yeah, because

98
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.440
I'm British of you because you're on board. I was just so bored.

99
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.220
I was really bored. It wasn't, I haven't watched it. It wasn't good. It,

100
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.180
she wasn't good, but he wasn't offensively bad. So what's the,

101
00:05:39.181 --> 00:05:41.700
what's the premise of the film by the way for likes. I have no clue.

102
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.760
I know the shell, but I haven't, it's basically the first movie,

103
00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:47.370
but with a bit of a twist, what, what what'd you know about ghost in the shell?

104
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.140
I've watched all of the standalone complex. Okay.

105
00:05:49.141 --> 00:05:52.440
So you basically know the best parts of ghost in the shell.

106
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.920
Don't worry about the movie. It's just the [inaudible] complex,

107
00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:00.160
smash it into hours and take away all the interesting things and.

108
00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.690
<v 0>You walk down and you've walked out of that. Yeah.</v>

109
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.180
<v 1>Well, how far in where you, you walked down,</v>

110
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.230
she gets to like the first fight scene, like with the invisible guy. Yeah, yeah.

111
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:13.700
Yeah. I got like 45 minutes before I realized I'm like,

112
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.040
I'm about to fall asleep now. But yeah,

113
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.220
that was probably the first 45 minutes was probably the best part of the movie.

114
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.920
Like these are comfortable, then the seats are comfortable.

115
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.490
Then the next second half, the way that the movie just ended,

116
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:28.370
where they were just kind of throwing in the whole cultural thing was just.

117
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.960
Scott, the Hanson was very well cast actress, but like not, not for that role.

118
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.910
I really respected scholar Jans and as an actress, but she just really, she,

119
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.490
it felt like she didn't care at all. It was like, no acting,

120
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.020
no one really gave a. It's like, I get you. You're supposed to be a cyborg,

121
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.370
but you know, put, put a little, she did that a bit too,

122
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.650
like a director when you're a robot right now. And she's like, say no more.

123
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.360
I got it. I understand. Yeah.

124
00:06:59.361 --> 00:07:01.430
I don't remember much about that movie, which is,

125
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.110
I've only walked out of one movie in the cinemas and that was a dream.

126
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.770
<v 0>I can pull [inaudible] cinemas.</v>

127
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.050
<v 1>Not walk out of that move. I wouldn't be like,</v>

128
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.450
I'll be having a great time watching dragon boy.

129
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.110
Cause I watched the trailer and I was like, God, this looks like.

130
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:18.423
I'm going to go watch it.

131
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.090
And then it was so much more boring than I thought it wasn't even like,

132
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.510
it wasn't like the so bad that it was good level. It was just really bad.

133
00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:28.660
I thought he was hilarious. I think it's hilarious. Wait, Chris,

134
00:07:28.661 --> 00:07:29.470
if you walked out of a movie.

135
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.570
<v 0>Theater, I've never been walked out of a movie theater.</v>

136
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.853
<v 1>This is the only one.</v>

137
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.840
There was one that I just stopped caring really about like very close to what

138
00:07:37.841 --> 00:07:41.390
life in general downsizing with David.

139
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:45.580
That's a terrible film is an airplane. I couldn't work out what was going on.

140
00:07:45.581 --> 00:07:49.020
If it was a comedy, if it was a drama, it was just all over the place.

141
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.850
But like how many times have you been to the cinema by your side?

142
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.600
<v 0>Uh, a lot. I used to go all the time. Yeah. I used to go like once a week. Yeah.</v>

143
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.450
<v 1>Cause like, if you're seeing a film of mates, like, huh, yeah.</v>

144
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.370
Caught there for better or worse.

145
00:08:00.371 --> 00:08:03.760
Even if your mates drag you to this Adam Sandler comedy.

146
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.720
<v 0>I think whatever. I mean, okay. One, I would watch this Adam Sandler movie,</v>

147
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.410
but uh, I mean, if I've planned to do it, it's an only in the evening.

148
00:08:11.411 --> 00:08:13.030
And I want to admit that my evening was,

149
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.660
was tarnished by this film because I'm still going to enjoy the popcorn no

150
00:08:16.661 --> 00:08:20.170
matter what, right? Like maybe I get a little nap in as well. My texts,

151
00:08:20.171 --> 00:08:25.060
my sheep feed my mates, Tom buy some and it takes crispy. And like Chris,

152
00:08:25.061 --> 00:08:26.290
when we collab in this film socks, dude.

153
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.880
<v 1>I don't know. Like I, I rarely go to cinemas anyway.</v>

154
00:08:30.881 --> 00:08:35.800
So I love cinemas. I love them. Yeah. It's just something nice and relaxing.

155
00:08:35.801 --> 00:08:37.630
And when you, especially in Japan or UK,

156
00:08:37.631 --> 00:08:42.400
people just throw popcorn and it's a mess. So good Japan as well,

157
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.850
rarely films that I think, yeah. I need to go see this now.

158
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.620
<v 0>Oh, I don't think that was any of the films I watched.</v>

159
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.290
I just think like I want to go to the cinema because I want the Popsicle.

160
00:08:50.291 --> 00:08:53.170
I just want the experience. And I liked the experience. I like sitting down.

161
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:58.650
<v 1>I did. I, I haven't seen it. No. Well,</v>

162
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:01.440
I mean it's special considering there's nothing out right now.

163
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.310
I thought it was nice to watch a movie. I'm not watching the demon slavery,

164
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.650
the Japanese.

165
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.240
Then I would go to the cinema so much more often because I love watching anime

166
00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:14.850
movies. Cause I'm actually in tons of foreign films there.
