1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.090
<v 0>Oh, do you guys have an exciting taxi journey? Yeah, so I,</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.810
I convinced Joey to get a taxi cause Jerry wanted to get the train home.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.210
Cause it's about like half the price, but you know, he was like.

4
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.400
<v 1>It was the day where Connor and I was streaming at the trash day's office.</v>

5
00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:14.234
If you guys saw.

6
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.690
<v 0>Yeah. But it was like 11:00 PM when we finished. Yeah. And I was like,</v>

7
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.360
getting the train home, come on, Joe. Let's get taxi on. Let's be comfortable.

8
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.463
Let's you know, it's late.

9
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.030
<v 1>What you see?</v>

10
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.870
I don't know why you like have this massive thing about like the comfort in

11
00:00:26.871 --> 00:00:30.530
taxi. It's not that much, not comfortable, much more comfortable.

12
00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:33.800
You see it as if it's like business class versus economy. Honestly.

13
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.963
<v 0>The way I see it,</v>

14
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.170
like also right now with the Rohner going on out of re if I can avoid getting a

15
00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:40.100
train, I'll avoid it. Yeah.

16
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.470
<v 1>I, I understand that. But for me,</v>

17
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.000
like I would most like 90% of the time I would rather get like, have,

18
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.660
have a longer journey that I can actually do stuff on because I can't do

19
00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:52.730
anything on a taxi. I look, I can do more on attacks.

20
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.660
I look at my phone and I immediately just get on a train in Japan. I mean,

21
00:00:56.661 --> 00:00:57.920
you can watch YouTube videos

22
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.270
because I get car sick because I didn't know why.

23
00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:05.720
I'm sorry that your natural selection didn't favor your charity. My problem

24
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.300
[inaudible] I think most people get car sick stuff.

25
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.350
<v 0>I'm focusing on the YouTube video. Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.130
<v 1>It's because it's because you can't see outside. So the inertia just you up.</v>

27
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.690
Yeah. Because that's how you get,

28
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.480
and I'm not sure about the exact science of car sickness,

29
00:01:23.481 --> 00:01:27.680
but I've liked cars are the only vehicle. I get motion sickness in.

30
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.870
Anything else I can like read? I can.

31
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.760
<v 0>Lift boats.</v>

32
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.680
<v 1>That's not carsick vehicle. I don't think I get seasick. Really?</v>

33
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.270
I get C6. I get, I guess,

34
00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:41.120
slightly seasonal because normally people who are car sick as sea sick.

35
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.700
I don't get carsick that easily though. Unless you're watching something.

36
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.520
But if I'm looking down at my phone or like, I can't like, like, I,

37
00:01:48.521 --> 00:01:51.650
I don't get car sick if I'm just sitting there listening to music.

38
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.460
Hell then yeah. It's boring. When you have to shovel like four hours in a car,

39
00:01:55.461 --> 00:01:58.280
what do you call? And I can go to bed. Yeah.

40
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.580
That's why I think that's why I've conditioned myself to be able to sleep so

41
00:02:01.581 --> 00:02:05.450
easily in cars because I literally can't do anything in cars, sleep.

42
00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:06.000
And listen to me.

43
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.380
I can do the exact same thing on a bus and not get sick on a bus.

44
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.840
I could be on a bus and watch YouTube or whatever or read. I can look at the,

45
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.210
you don't want to do this, but I can't. But, but,

46
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.540
but if I did it in the car, I think it's five minutes in.

47
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.410
I think it's the smaller the vehicle. The more likely to get sick.

48
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.980
I don't know what the science is behind that. But if it's like a, like,

49
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.570
if it's like a small taxi,

50
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.890
especially if it's a small taxi and we're like squeezed in then the back seat.

51
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.930
And if you're in the backseat, I just get immediately.

52
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.850
<v 0>You're the son of the taxi. I don't want to,</v>

53
00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:39.290
I don't want to make eye contact with the taxi.

54
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.240
<v 1>You don't have to. What do you think?</v>

55
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.700
You're just going to do this the entire sometimes, you know,

56
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:45.320
you might find yourself wandering and you're like.

57
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.860
<v 0>Wait a minute. This is awkward moment of like, hi, I did no,</v>

58
00:02:48.861 --> 00:02:50.060
I never drive in good driving.

59
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.310
<v 1>I'm awkward. I don't want to make eye contact. Like I have the,</v>

60
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.170
I have the same problem in the back seat where I accidentally sometimes look at

61
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.630
[inaudible] eyes with them. And then just like,

62
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.550
hi that you just have to do my back silent. Like the worst, the worst.

63
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.160
<v 0>When there are awful drivers. Well,</v>

64
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.340
you got to pretend like they're doing a good job and they're just sad.

65
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.450
<v 1>I mean the front,</v>

66
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.570
cause I'm less likely to get sick in the front from driving down in the back.

67
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.170
Cause you're thrown around in the back. Anyway. The stories. Yeah,

68
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.520
we were talking about, I can go back into tax anyway.

69
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.390
So Connor was like, look, it's it's 20 minutes home on a,

70
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.350
on a comfy taxi quicker by only like five, 10 minutes.

71
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.720
<v 0>Closer to our house. Cause we don't have to go to the station. We'll walk right.</v>

72
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:37.530
Not that much, but yeah.

73
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.840
<v 1>So I was like, all right, it. I'll humor your taxi ride.</v>

74
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.380
So then we get in the taxi, the taxi is driving fine.

75
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.640
And then we go onto this slight kind of breech thing. And uh,

76
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.930
and then it's just some random police officer just walks out onto the street and

77
00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:55.920
kind of flags us down. Right. And tells us to go into one of the roads.

78
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.330
And immediately the taxi driver was like, does the Japanese equivalent of, Oh.

79
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.090
He's like slate as nine-year-old. Oh.

80
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.300
And he pulls in and Conrad, like what the is going on?

81
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.540
And I asked the taxi driver, I'm like, uh, something wrong. And he's like,

82
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.980
I was speeding. I was like, well,

83
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.490
you got stopped for speeding. And he's like, yeah, I was doing 80 down to 60.

84
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.640
And this old dude just like walks out of the taxi, like, you know,

85
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.370
Ozzy Osborne started just like kind of stumbles out.

86
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.850
<v 0>Four policemen surrounded this old poor old man.</v>

87
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.900
<v 1>Yeah. And like in the middle of the night is he's filling out this paperwork and</v>

88
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.420
Connor. And I was just kind of sitting there being like, Oh,

89
00:04:39.421 --> 00:04:42.600
we could have been home by now. If we went on the train one time,

90
00:04:42.601 --> 00:04:44.340
a human this man to get on the taxi.

91
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.140
<v 0>First time I ever had a taxi driver been pulled over by the police, you know,</v>

92
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.050
because I was like, I was like, I was just hoping that they wouldn't be like,

93
00:04:52.051 --> 00:04:52.950
all right, let's have a look. What these,

94
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.360
these boys in the back look pretty foreign.

95
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.650
Let's see what's going on with these boys.

96
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.910
<v 1>Come on. Yeah. No, I was afraid that might happen as well.</v>

97
00:04:59.911 --> 00:05:04.020
So immediately like before the police officer even started talking to us,

98
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.730
I just immediately he'd be like, what's going on? Yes. I am. Japanese.

99
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.530
<v 0>Officers asked us. They were like, is it okay if we stop you for now?</v>

100
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.960
Like the driver? Yeah.

101
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.670
<v 1>W w w w w what if we said, no,</v>

102
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.890
we're in the middle of nowhere. There's no taxis anywhere.

103
00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:24.060
What do you expect us to do? Like.

104
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.510
<v 0>Pulled us over there over some bridge. So there wasn't like much there.</v>

105
00:05:27.511 --> 00:05:29.610
So it was just like some water. Right.

106
00:05:29.611 --> 00:05:32.250
And like a bunch of like a power plant nearby. So I was like, no, thanks.

107
00:05:32.251 --> 00:05:33.084
I was pretty honest.

108
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.600
<v 1>For police officers. Like busted down this decrepit town.</v>

109
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.580
<v 0>Yeah. Just for this guy.</v>

110
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.470
Then there's two other police officers just standing there doing nothing because

111
00:05:40.471 --> 00:05:41.130
that's what they do here.

112
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.570
<v 1>Every police officer, every police story I've heard in Japan is,</v>

113
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.600
is all about how many police officers you need versus how many was that?

114
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.290
<v 0>I actually need to be sent like six police officers to like, you know,</v>

115
00:05:52.291 --> 00:05:55.290
someone falling over on a bike. Yeah. It's like, it's insane.

116
00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.920
There's so bored here. They've nothing to do old. They need.

117
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.660
<v 1>Spotters. Right. I got you, bro. Nice policing. You're doing that.</v>

118
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.630
Yeah. Cause normally.

119
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.660
<v 0>Okay. It's always like two people. Like it's always just a squad. Yeah, exactly.</v>

120
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.720
You don't want on your apartment. Right. That's normally how it should be.

121
00:06:10.721 --> 00:06:13.930
Right. Because also this, I don't know if this is on purpose,

122
00:06:13.931 --> 00:06:18.310
but it's very intimidating when four or five policemen are crowding around you

123
00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:20.710
and you haven't done anything and they're asking you questions. They all,

124
00:06:20.711 --> 00:06:23.350
they all look off and I'm like, well, come on, let's go on here. Then.

125
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:26.710
<v 1>[Inaudible] bad for the old dude.</v>

126
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.640
Cause he looked like he was about to get beaten up by school police officers

127
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.980
because they literally just, just crowding around him.

128
00:06:32.981 --> 00:06:34.600
Just like looking down at the people.

129
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.020
<v 0>I've never been in this situation as well.</v>

130
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.820
So this is the first time where I've been near police where they haven't asked

131
00:06:39.821 --> 00:06:41.860
for like my ID and like information stuff.

132
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.900
<v 1>Yeah. Because I busted out the Japanese crew.</v>

133
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.950
<v 0>Cause you just go near them and they're like, Hey, can we see ID and all this?</v>

134
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.890
And I'm like, why I'm not involved in this? I'm literally just a customer.

135
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:51.963
Leave me alone.

136
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.470
<v 1>Do you think I had a gun pointing to this?</v>

137
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.760
[inaudible] like stop playing European in the background. Hey, come on gas,

138
00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.090
drift this corner. I know I'm doing it. I'm not, I'm doing it all the time.
