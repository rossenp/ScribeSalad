1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.841
<v 0>But, uh, yeah,</v>

2
00:00:00.841 --> 00:00:05.550
let's talk about some current topics that don't just nostalgic trips back to

3
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:06.384
high school.

4
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.070
<v 1>Talk about high school and so much, but I'm gonna still be funny stories. Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.810
It's, it's the prologue to our life memories, people listening.

6
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.710
<v 0>So this was still in high school, went understand,</v>

7
00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:18.410
but once you're out of high school, you'll understand. You'll look back on them.

8
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.300
You sound like such a grandpa saying that you'll look back to your high school

9
00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:28.070
one day back in the day when we only had three I-phones no, but,

10
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.070
um, what's the, I guess the big news,

11
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.520
of course, everyone's your news by the time this episode everyone's loving that,

12
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.410
but I guess like some news that is more industry driven is the whole,

13
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.440
uh Funimation and crunch roll thing. Right?

14
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.490
So Sony buying out, crunchy roll,

15
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.010
basically having a control of like most of the big anime companies just

16
00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:56.600
monopolize the Western market.

17
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.440
<v 1>It is, it is slightly worrying from an off when you hear that,</v>

18
00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:04.790
initially that's a lot of market share that Sony has. Yeah.

19
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.110
Like how would, at what point would it be considered a Sony? Like,

20
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.720
I guess from a monopoly, if they had like Netflix,

21
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.780
I feel like if they had crunch.

22
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.660
<v 0>Roll Funimation and Netflix, then, then it would be like, then it,</v>

23
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.600
then it would be like 99% basically.

24
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.980
Cause basically I think the only other company is probably since I film works

25
00:01:24.981 --> 00:01:29.150
who do high dive and they're still going, I know it's still going.

26
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.380
Sorry, sorry. I guess just.

27
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.570
<v 1>Not available outside the U S right? So it's.</v>

28
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.140
<v 0>No it's available in the UK as well. Yeah. I didn't know that, but I, I,</v>

29
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.130
the problem with high dive is that I don't know how many big,

30
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.400
like exclusive titles that they have. I mean, how can you compete?

31
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.220
Cause the only, the only thing that I've watched,

32
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.090
like the only big exclusive I've watched off high dive is probably legend of the

33
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:57.350
galactic heroes. And that's like, that's like old, old,

34
00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:58.573
like the old,

35
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.690
they're the only service that have licensed the OJI legend of neglect to kill a

36
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.070
while. And I feel like,

37
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.480
I don't know other how many other exclusives they have outside of that?

38
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.540
I never used high dose. Cause I know it made him the best.

39
00:02:11.541 --> 00:02:13.760
I watched that on Amazon strike

40
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.350
Amazon strike. If Amazon stopped buying it.

41
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.020
<v 1>Cause like, I don't know what anime they've got getting anymore.</v>

42
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.520
<v 0>The problem with Amazon is that they buy one big show.</v>

43
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.890
They want like last year they had bill and saga.

44
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.030
But the big problem with it Amazon is that they sometimes get big shows,

45
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.890
but I've done other marketing.

46
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.090
I hate like watching anime on Amazon because they,

47
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.250
I don't know what shows they have half the time.

48
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.530
They actually have quite a lot of anime,

49
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.550
but nobody knows about this because nobody work. Just anime on Amazon. Yeah.

50
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.630
Not to mention that.

51
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.780
I think the general problem with Amazon is that they don't know how to market

52
00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:58.280
it. Like you find out usually second-hand from someone who's like, Oh,

53
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.160
I watch soccer on Amazon.

54
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.550
<v 1>And you just like Finland soccer is Amazon. What the? I mean, Amazon is Finland.</v>

55
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.820
Yeah. Like actually watching it isn't bad.

56
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.910
Like the players are really good and I don't know like what conversion they're

57
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:13.270
using, but like, man, it looks Christmas. Yeah. But God.

58
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.430
Is it horrible to use their platform? Holy dude. I'm like, am I renting the?

59
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.560
Or am I streaming it? That's clear half the time. I didn't mean to rent bar at,

60
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:27.940
why am I, why am I watching? I try to watch anime. What the? Amazon.

61
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.630
And then also, because now obviously we're using,

62
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:35.650
I'm using Amazon prime in Japan. Yeah. Amazon did that pro game.

63
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:37.630
A move of being like, um, yeah,

64
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.780
no subtitles for other languages outside of this country.

65
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.810
So if I want to watch it, I have to buy prime,

66
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:47.470
which I have in Japan and prime in the UK or the U S, which is just stupid.

67
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.740
It's probably even worse for you here. Like UK prime work for you here. No,

68
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:52.900
you couldn't do that because it doesn't work for me. No, no. You need to use,

69
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.010
you have prime, but it's really Japanese prime. It doesn't offer any English.

70
00:03:57.011 --> 00:03:59.470
Subtitles. Yeah. And obviously, because they're like,

71
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:01.510
we don't want people going on to other countries and buying stuff,

72
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.710
which kind of makes sense. But also why, like, who cares? Like,

73
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.800
like it's 20, 20, I dunno why licensing laws.

74
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:12.940
Haven't caught up to the fact that the it's a global media rail.

75
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.820
If you're not going to, if you, if you're going to limit it to one country,

76
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:17.650
people are going to find a way to, you know,

77
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.260
find other ways to watch it because people are going to watch it.

78
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:22.300
Whatever happens. Like most people like,

79
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.360
cause I keep these threads on like on Reddit where I like, bro,

80
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.900
if you buy Netflix now in Turkey, you can get it for like $2. And I'm like,

81
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.550
but that seems like a lot of, like really calf that much.

82
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.470
I'm glad that if I put all that effort in, I can save a whole $4. Yeah.

83
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.740
You got to keep using a VPN when you logged in and do that anyway.

84
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.940
So you already paid for the VPN anyway and it's like, it's not worth the effort,

85
00:04:45.941 --> 00:04:50.170
man. Like, do I really need this? No, I don't. Who cares? Like, I'll just,

86
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:51.640
I just want it in the country that I'm in.

87
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.240
I don't wanna have to around with VPNs. Don't make this hard for me. Yeah.

88
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.300
And Amazon, obviously you made it. They're like, how about,

89
00:04:57.301 --> 00:05:00.460
how do we make it as hard as possible every single day?

90
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.050
How do we make it so that you accidentally buy a instead of watching villain?

91
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:08.530
Sorry. That's basically like the Amazon prime experience. Do we have any like,

92
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.160
I guess,

93
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.540
cause there is very little information about the whole like Sony acquisition.

94
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.590
All right. Yeah. I mean it's, it's still very early days now mainly.

95
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.990
And how much was it for how much was because we don't know.

96
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.960
<v 2>Innovation buying or Sony buying cultivation or Sony buying credit.</v>

97
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.240
So Sony,

98
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.920
when they bought 95% of Funimation in 2017,

99
00:05:31.921 --> 00:05:33.870
it was around 143 million.

100
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.310
<v 1>That's right. That did do that. 43 for Funimation.</v>

101
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.900
<v 2>Crunchy roll it's around 1.2 billion.</v>

102
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.860
<v 1>Wasn't Amazon only like 900 million number again. One,</v>

103
00:05:49.861 --> 00:05:54.630
1.1 $0.2 billion. Gigi,

104
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.310
Gigi crush shuttle. That's more Amazon bought.

105
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.270
<v 0>Twitch switch for Jesus Christ. Wow. Oh my God.</v>

106
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.680
The question that I want to know for Funimation yeah. That's already surprising,

107
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:10.260
but like the, the biggest question I have is like, it's like, all right, cool.

108
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.450
You have all this money, right. To spend on crunch, roll in front of nation.

109
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.060
That's fine. But in my opinion, it's just like,

110
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.940
what are you going to do with it? Is the question. I mean,

111
00:06:18.941 --> 00:06:23.680
I guess because when Sony back in the day bought the 95% of Funimation or

112
00:06:23.681 --> 00:06:26.620
whatever, it was like, mm, not gonna lie. They didn't,

113
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.420
they didn't really do much with it. Yeah.

114
00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:31.390
I haven't seen much of a change from Funimation. I like,

115
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.430
I don't know how well Funimation was doing back then,

116
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.180
but it seems like they've just gone, gone on business as usual.

117
00:06:37.181 --> 00:06:39.670
Now 1.2 billion for crunch,

118
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.640
or just kind of sees how much they're investing in anime, I guess.

119
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.590
And because they must see the potential in the anime industry to get to

120
00:06:47.591 --> 00:06:48.670
like chill out this big,

121
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.590
I guess maybe they're willing to throw that much money because they realized

122
00:06:52.591 --> 00:06:56.290
that there is a massive competitive now, and that is Netflix. Yeah.

123
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.770
<v 1>Yeah. I mean,</v>

124
00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.200
I guess when you put it into perspective of like Twitch was bought out,

125
00:06:59.201 --> 00:07:00.880
but that was like how many years ago was Twitch bought out by.

126
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.600
<v 0>Like 20? Probably around the same time that Sonny first bought Funimation. Yeah.</v>

127
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:07.450
<v 1>No, it was earlier than that. I think it was like 2016, right?</v>

128
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.320
It must've happened 2015. Really? Yeah. But still can you Google it? Yeah.

129
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.780
<v 0>2001. Twitch was like the big back then.</v>

130
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.290
Yeah. So Twitch was 970 million.

131
00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.090
<v 1>We just switched to 2014. I understand.</v>

132
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.050
You only make sense of Twitch nowadays pretty worth like five, six times easily.

133
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:26.530
Yeah.

134
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.100
<v 0>Yeah. But that was, I would say that, you know, getting to that point,</v>

135
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.090
comparing Crunchyroll now to Twitch back then, which is still bigger.

136
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.720
I would say, I would say like Twitch was like a hot property.

137
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.210
Cause everyone was expecting YouTube by Twitch.

138
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.390
I remember back in the day where we hit, like where it was just like, yeah,

139
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.580
everyone, just, everyone was like, well, Google was going to buy it too.

140
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:47.570
Which that just, that's just a natural move. Right.

141
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:52.870
And it was a big surprise when Amazon kind of, [inaudible].

142
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.410
<v 1>Been great for creators there, but like, yeah, but that happened,</v>

143
00:07:56.411 --> 00:07:59.860
but I'm curious as to why. Um, do you have any thoughts of my wife?

144
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.170
This might be good or bad for anime fans?

145
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.170
<v 0>I mean, I'd say as a consumer,</v>

146
00:08:05.171 --> 00:08:09.070
it would probably be better because okay. For money.

147
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.380
<v 1>In the, in the industry is always better. It's.</v>

148
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.820
<v 0>Not only that, but I remember,</v>

149
00:08:12.821 --> 00:08:16.390
I would say like the golden age of like anime streaming was,

150
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.380
remember when you could get every anime you could conceivably want to watch on

151
00:08:20.381 --> 00:08:22.480
one platform, which was crunchy roll back in the day.

152
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.900
And then it kind of just like got spread out to, you know,

153
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:27.190
different streaming companies.

154
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.210
And that was inevitable that it was going to inevitably. But I,

155
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.340
the biggest thing I find annoying, isn't the,

156
00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.260
isn't just the fact that I have to pay for like different streaming companies.

157
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:38.380
It's just the fact that nowadays when I see, when I go through the,

158
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.980
when I go through an anime char I literally have no idea which anime is going to

159
00:08:41.981 --> 00:08:43.750
be on which platform. Yeah, that's true. I was,

160
00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.250
this specifically says like prime example. Like I just, like,

161
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.650
I just want to like log onto one service and be like, okay, I just want to,

162
00:08:50.651 --> 00:08:52.450
I don't care how much I'm paying for this service.

163
00:08:52.451 --> 00:08:53.530
I just wouldn't want it to one.

164
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:56.310
I just want to watch all the anime want to watch it at one service.

165
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.000
<v 1>It's like confusing because I thought, ah [inaudible]</v>

166
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.000
. Is that correct? Yeah. It was on Netflix. No, that was on crunchy crunch, but

167
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 it is on Netflix. Is it in Japan? No. In Japan. In Japan, it's really confusing living in Japan. 

168
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Cause I'm like, wait, who owns? What? Because Japan like, because

169
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 obviously it's pretty much Japan rest of

170
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 the world. That's how it works. Right. Obviously. And it was really confusing. So I'm like, 

171
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.000
wait, wait, where do I watch it though? I realize Netflix doesn't offer English 

172
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.000
sometimes, probably for that reason too. The

173
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.000
 licensing, right? Yeah. It's a mess. It is a mess

174
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.000
. It's like, how do I, how do I know what the I'm watching? And then everyone's just laughing being like, ha 

175
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.833
ha piracy. You know, like, yeah. I mean, I want to pay, I want an easy service.

176
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.480
<v 0>I mean, I, I want a convenience service.</v>

177
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.210
Like I am willing to pay for a convenience service,

178
00:09:41.211 --> 00:09:46.010
which for the longest time it was until it wasn't. And now it's like,

179
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.560
I, you know, I want to support the industry, but at the same time,

180
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:51.890
it's just like, if, if I'm having trouble finding which service has got,

181
00:09:51.891 --> 00:09:54.980
which anime, like I literally have two lists. There,

182
00:09:54.981 --> 00:09:57.860
there is a dedicated search engine for this, which is like,

183
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:59.900
I think the name is like, because Maui or something,

184
00:09:59.901 --> 00:10:01.520
that's the name of the website, right?

185
00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:06.320
That's literally a dedicated search engine to search which anime is,

186
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.900
is on which streaming. So someone had to make that.

187
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:14.270
<v 1>It's like, there's, pre-owned uh, like, like a spreadsheet,</v>

188
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.840
like pre-order to know what's on what me.

189
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:23.180
<v 0>Say then in that instance that I guess like a full monopoly of the</v>

190
00:10:23.181 --> 00:10:26.240
Western market onto one service is a benefit.

191
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.930
<v 1>I mean, it's not the no, not monopoly though, is it really.</v>

192
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.380
<v 0>Right? But that's what I'm saying though. Like if, for example, he's always bad.</v>

193
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.500
Yeah. But that's what I'm saying. But for example, if Sony,

194
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.780
hypothetically is like, Hey,

195
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:43.400
we want to like buy the anime side of things from the Netflix's thing. Right.

196
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.010
That would truly, I would say turn it into a monopoly.

197
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:46.963
At least in terms of the West.

198
00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.870
<v 1>Basically be at no monopoly, that'd be awful for the anime fan.</v>

199
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.670
So it would be all for anime fans. But.

200
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.880
<v 0>Same logic they gone was saying it would all be on one platform too.</v>

201
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:59.810
I mean that, that's kind of like the kind of like the Disney argument now,

202
00:10:59.811 --> 00:11:04.700
isn't it like, yes. All my characters now are going to be in the MCU.

203
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.600
Yay. For monopoly right here, you know?

204
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:11.780
<v 1>Right. It's like with, with the whole Disney,</v>

205
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.020
it's worrying because if everything's on Disney,

206
00:11:15.021 --> 00:11:19.670
we only get Disney esque products. Right. I don't want Disney. I hate this.

207
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.520
<v 0>Remind me of, uh, the other day when I was streaming,</v>

208
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.550
I don't know how true this is. So take this with a grain of salt.

209
00:11:25.551 --> 00:11:30.260
But somebody was saying that there's a rumor that Disney might be acquiring

210
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:35.060
Sean and jump. Oh my God. No, no, no. Seriously.

211
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.290
I don't know how true that is. Back. Check this mailing. Please. Can you,

212
00:11:39.291 --> 00:11:40.820
can you fact check this check?

213
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.690
Because he sounded pretty convincing when someone like people in the chat were

214
00:11:44.691 --> 00:11:45.201
talking about it,

215
00:11:45.201 --> 00:11:49.790
but apparently Disney is thinking to acquire it because they want to do a

216
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.740
collaborative thing between my hero, academia and MCU.

217
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:55.270
No.

218
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:59.710
<v 1>And I'm just in my head outside. That's gotta be a troll. If it is a troll, then</v>

219
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.200
if it is a troll, then I fallen for the bait. But at the same time,

220
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.110
I wouldn't be surprised if Disney actually won.

221
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.100
<v 0>I do. I cannot stand it.</v>

222
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.760
<v 1>Well, because like, think about it. It's like MCU, super heroes. My hero,</v>

223
00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:19.350
super heroes. It's a match made in heaven according to Disney. Right.

224
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:23.100
<v 0>Bro. I can't wait for when life, all my, it shows up in Avengers.</v>

225
00:12:23.101 --> 00:12:27.000
Five was I'm like, you don't see it.

226
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:29.933
[inaudible].

227
00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:36.120
<v 1>Do you know what that would mean though? The like Thanos versus Goku means like</v>

228
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:42.540
I'm gonna come. Like you won't be horrible for like a realistic standpoint,

229
00:12:42.541 --> 00:12:43.374
but my God

230
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:49.050
and memes that would come out of this will be up again.

231
00:12:49.051 --> 00:12:51.870
Like take it with a grain of salt. It might be a troll. It might be,

232
00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.650
I might be talking out of my. I don't know.

233
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.500
That just means like every MCU conversation would, would end with both.

234
00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:01.560
Goku could be a Coke and could be captain America.
