1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.390
<v 0>So you,</v>

2
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.480
so you went from being an intern to working with lupine and then being an

3
00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:06.900
in-betweener to just going straight into the dragon ball. Super. No, no, no,

4
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:07.734
of course not.

5
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.170
<v 1>So Mike had done my internship at telecom animation theme satellite.</v>

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.190
So I have done two internship, uh, six months, uh, if you.

7
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.440
<v 0>Put it all.</v>

8
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.790
<v 1>Together. And, uh, when I finished my school, I said, okay,</v>

9
00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:27.010
I have it in two internship. Uh, I know it's hard. That's a take on me.

10
00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:28.490
It was a good mood at a, at a Saturday.

11
00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:31.640
I just was more cold and you have to hurry and you are,

12
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.030
you are paid or so by frame. So the, the money.

13
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.020
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.490
It's per frame here rather than per day to ask you what that might be out of

15
00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:41.324
frame.

16
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.250
<v 1>Uh, well, when you're in between, uh, you are paid,</v>

17
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.040
they're like a two euros per frame.

18
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.280
<v 0>Two euros per frame. Yeah. That's Holy.</v>

19
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.040
Seven USD. So you would draw a fruit, go to family, Mark,

20
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.270
get a sandwich and you just

21
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.770
play three or four bucks us less that's before tax, right?

22
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.413
Uh, yeah. Oh,

23
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.010
I assume you wouldn't even make enough to go for the tax cost.

24
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.180
<v 1>When you take a drink. You okay. Uh,</v>

25
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.530
can I bought by maybe? Yes. Oh, I have to do.

26
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.620
<v 0>So. So your, so your you're making a good choice.</v>

27
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.640
I need to draw more so I can eat. Okay. So how,

28
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.100
how long would you say it takes you to do a frame?

29
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.150
<v 1>I guess it depends. Depends. The frame can be just five minutes, right? Right.</v>

30
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.110
Uh, some frame can do cute. Two, three hours.

31
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.260
<v 0>That's. I mean, this has been a hot button topic in the industry for a while.</v>

32
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.750
I think, I think a lot of people do talk about the animators get paid,

33
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.790
but just hearing it from natural animator, just, you know.

34
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.310
<v 1>And also because nowadays the anime getting more details and</v>

35
00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:53.600
more, more lines.

36
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.550
<v 0>How's the scanner more soccer.</v>

37
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.060
<v 1>It was 50 years ago. Uh, when you draw one frame,</v>

38
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.290
you can eat one ramen. Right.

39
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.230
But the rate of the life increase, but the frame.

40
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:15.260
<v 0>Yeah. Oh, okay. So now you have new inflation. So now if you want to.</v>

41
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.430
<v 1>Um, and you hear that at least to do a five or six frame. Oh, Mark.</v>

42
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.940
<v 0>If you don't mind me asking, when did your internship initially,</v>

43
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.700
how much are you getting paid for that? And w were you living off Justin.

44
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.390
<v 1>At the first internship? I wasn't paid. Oh, wow. Yeah. Okay.</v>

45
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.410
But the second internship.

46
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.390
<v 0>I was paid, so it really was like a passion.</v>

47
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.830
<v 1>It was a patience thing.</v>

48
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.960
Then I was knowing that my internship you are paid or not, but they,

49
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.790
I was paid. So by, by frame for my internship that Saturday. And so I knew,

50
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.890
okay, it's really hard. So I tried to do my best, but yeah,

51
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.970
I always, or just my one month, my best recorder, when I wasn't your internship,

52
00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:55.850
it was just 150 hundred. The frames.

53
00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.850
<v 0>Yeah. Solely Twitter. So like $300. Yeah. Oh my gosh. For a month, for a month.</v>

54
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.790
And a specialized a job as well.

55
00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.350
<v 1>So this wasn't my internship. And so it wasn't.</v>

56
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.251
<v 0>So wait,</v>

57
00:03:08.251 --> 00:03:11.040
the guy who was probably cleaning the toilets at the studio was probably getting

58
00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:13.710
paid more than that.

59
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.060
<v 2>Yeah. Honestly, it's probably true. If you walk a company.</v>

60
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.730
<v 0>Put it into perspective, like not trying to diminish any jobs of cliquey,</v>

61
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.490
but like, I mean, you know, cleaning the toilet is not a specialized skill.

62
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.260
McDonald's especially considering how art school was like one of the most

63
00:03:34.261 --> 00:03:37.950
expensive school. I was trying to little, any of the jobs, we need those jobs,

64
00:03:37.951 --> 00:03:40.800
but like yeah. The fact that it is a specialized job. Yeah.

65
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.170
You can do your best was 300.

66
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.210
<v 1>It was my internship. I had an.</v>

67
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.110
<v 0>Internship. That's not enough to live. Right. And.</v>

68
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.470
<v 1>Yes, sure. But, uh, like I said, I, um, my mother dripping, yes, I am fair.</v>

69
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.430
I had a family in Japan, in Tokyo, so, uh, yes. Uh, yeah,

70
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.350
it was cool because my family, I was living in the house of my, uh, grandmother.

71
00:04:04.351 --> 00:04:05.184
So it was okay.

72
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.130
<v 0>Oh, okay. That's nice. That's like rant or anything like that.</v>

73
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.610
<v 1>I was, I had luck, but if I, so I was thinking Manny for foreign people,</v>

74
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.070
if you don't have family. Yeah.

75
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.470
<v 0>Did you have friends who didn't have family here? Who.</v>

76
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.360
<v 1>Yeah. But, uh, that today get a bitter.</v>

77
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.950
They could negotiate a better than me. So that's why you'll have to,

78
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.170
uh, now the good advice is you have to look, uh,

79
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.300
the good statue to, uh, take a lot of information of each Sergio.

80
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.850
Did they pay? Yeah. I'd say it was, uh, yeah, it was just the entire him.

81
00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:47.220
So I cannot take exemplar status,

82
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.080
but I more example on graph Nika [inaudible] was doing in

83
00:04:52.081 --> 00:04:55.820
between the digital in-betweens. Right, right, right. Digital.

84
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.090
It was more quicker.

85
00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.640
<v 0>Okay. But that was the pay. The same.</v>

86
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.680
<v 1>The pay was the same, but the pay was the same, but, uh, we had a [inaudible],</v>

87
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.680
uh,  it's mean, uh,  so you have a, or a fixer amount of salary and it was, uh,

88
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.680
 at least, uh, uh,  400 euros a month, a month. And you end date ask you to do,

89
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.680
uh,  300 frames per month. It was at

90
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.680
 least do 300 frames, at least 300 frames a month. And so when your

91
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.513
 success to do the [inaudible]

92
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.640
you to your source 300 to two years,

93
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.700
you have 600 plus this fixed salary.

94
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.180
[inaudible].

95
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.190
<v 0>For a specialist job. It's still quite low.</v>

96
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.140
<v 2>Very low, but.</v>

97
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.550
<v 1>Uh, my best recourse, wet, uh, recalled. Well, uh,</v>

98
00:05:50.551 --> 00:05:54.890
when I was doing in between, uh, uh, 600

99
00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.930
frames a month. So she's gonna go to the tour.

100
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.080
[inaudible] 502.

101
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.700
<v 0>For an internship. That's probably like $1,500. That's probably not bad.</v>

102
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.490
Okay. Well, let me most wailing space over there.

103
00:06:18.491 --> 00:06:19.720
And he's like sweating right now.

104
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.890
<v 1>Yes. And so most of my coworkers and I have I'm working, um,</v>

105
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.130
I'm living with, uh, at my parent's house.

106
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.660
I'm living with a share house. It must have. Yes.

107
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.440
So you have to pay attention about your money, how you spend,

108
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.010
it's not a glamorous lifestyle. I don't know. You, you, you,

109
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.930
you don't leave your survival, right? Yeah.

110
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.330
<v 0>I think a lot of people, sometimes don't like,</v>

111
00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.510
I remember I've had people come too. Cause I'll be like with like, uh,

112
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.150
I remember I had a animatics player. I was with trigger and they were like, Oh,

113
00:06:52.151 --> 00:06:54.990
they want a job at trigger. And I'm like, do you do,

114
00:06:54.991 --> 00:06:56.800
do you really want a job where like,

115
00:06:56.801 --> 00:07:00.030
you really have to work your off or you work hours? Like if you don't.

116
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.500
<v 1>I do a Griffin ago. Yeah.</v>

117
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.330
So I started at 10 and, uh,

118
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:12.350
and it depends on about the deadlines or you have some time I arrived and

119
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:15.310

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.450
you have to finish this for this evening. Yeah. At eight. Okay.

121
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.630
I will do so. I don't eat lunch.

122
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.370
<v 0>Blonde shirt. Very opposite. It was a little bit.</v>

123
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:30.070
<v 1>Yeah. And sometimes they have, Oh, some good kids. I want to do this.</v>

124
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:35.260
Please let me do this. Okay. Just wait. I need three days. Oh, okay.

125
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.400
Well, what I would say, because I wanted to as Pokemon guys,

126
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.580
so I wanted to walk Pokemon, uh, and.

127
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.150
<v 0>You make an exception and you're like, I like Pokemon. I ruined my life,</v>

128
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:48.220
which was brew, uh.

129
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.730
<v 1>Blue. Yeah. It was a Pokemon generation on YouTube.</v>

130
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.690
<v 0>Oh, cool. Wow. Yeah.</v>

131
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.500
<v 1>Yeah. And it was blue with a I in Japanese. You say CMX summit. I don't know.</v>

132
00:07:59.501 --> 00:08:03.370
In English. And so there's French.

133
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.990
<v 0>Names as well. Isn't there? French localized.</v>

134
00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.970
<v 1>French names, Tatanka.</v>

135
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.400
<v 0>[Inaudible] I learned about that.</v>

136
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.370
Apparently the French lift stations were like really well done for Pokemon

137
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:16.900
really, really well done.

138
00:08:16.901 --> 00:08:19.900
And all the names were like really well thought out and stupid,

139
00:08:19.901 --> 00:08:23.500
like a mix of Japanese and French mythologies. I mean, Tom, Tom,

140
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:29.080
Tom sounds bad. He's a tank. That's awesome.

141
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.280
Wow. That is like the very opposite of European lifestyle where it's like, Oh,

142
00:08:33.281 --> 00:08:36.250
it's five. Oh, the building's on fire. It's five. O'clock I'm going.

143
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:37.953
It's like this.

144
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.270
<v 1>So yeah. Yeah. In between you have to be passionate. You have to love.</v>

145
00:08:43.271 --> 00:08:47.380
And you mentioned that a lot and also it depends what kind of experience you

146
00:08:47.381 --> 00:08:50.410
want if it's just, Oh, I want to walk.

147
00:08:50.411 --> 00:08:54.910
I just want for this show or narrow two on one piece. I don't know. Or,

148
00:08:55.770 --> 00:09:00.270
Oh, I was just a one who, two years experience in Japan. No,

149
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.550
I wanted to have a carrier in Japan, so.

150
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:03.890
<v 0>Right. It depends on what they experienced.</v>

151
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:06.500
So you often find people come into the companies.

152
00:09:06.501 --> 00:09:08.600
Like I only want to be here for a year or two then go back. Yeah.

153
00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.760
<v 1>Yeah. So sometimes you have,</v>

154
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:15.440
sometimes some people have came in Japan and they had some homesick because

155
00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.090
it was the first time they came in Japan and the food didn't go well

156
00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:25.820
and they couldn't speak Japanese. So yeah. So it's the most,

157
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.090
an English was a so-so. Yeah. So yeah,

158
00:09:29.091 --> 00:09:32.000
so he was difficult to make some friends. And so yes.

159
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:37.340

160
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.380
<v 0>Just a couple of completely different lifestyles.</v>

161
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.600
Did you know English before you came to Japan?

162
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:45.980

163
00:09:45.981 --> 00:09:46.890
