WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.710
<v 0>Hold on a second. I'd like to point out, uh,</v>

2
00:00:01.711 --> 00:00:04.290
for someone who says he doesn't like Jubilee films, he,

3
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.990
you gave him one on leukemia. A 10. Yeah.

4
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.830
Will you stick by that? Because if you do, then I can high-five you, but if not,

5
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.420
the backhand is coming. Okay. Um, what did I give spirited away?

6
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.570
Uh, let me see, because I th I think thinking back one of the, okay.

7
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.520
Is one of my games, spirited away at nine. Okay then. Yeah, yeah,

8
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.450
yeah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.550
I really have to think about that because I don't like Ghibli films,

10
00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:39.350
but I think Manono cane spirit of the way are some of the few where I start,

11
00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:44.330
I stick by, I stick by them. I also love how you gave go a six.

12
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.170
That's pretty high. If you asked me, I thought he was good.

13
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.760
I just have you read the manga. I have read the Mark. Did you give it a six?

14
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.820
[inaudible] a ginger Yuto, manga that,

15
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.800
and they made a movie about it like five years ago. I think it is.

16
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.070
I think it was a fun reveal. I had a fun time watching a cookie.

17
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.600
I was so sad watching it.

18
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.000
Cause the thing about guilt is that I watched the anime,

19
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.080
not knowing any background about it, not knowing it was ginger Yuto.

20
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.020
I thought he was just like campy B movie horror movie, which is,

21
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.090
which is which it is, which it is.

22
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.790
But I remember because I went into that thinking he was going to be absolute

23
00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:25.790
trash and I watched it.

24
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.130
And despite it actually being, you know, trashy and it was trash,

25
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.820
it gave me the same kind of enjoyment as you do watching a beat mover beat me.

26
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.880
Cause it wasn't like it was animation because Keogh,

27
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:41.270
the movie was animated by [inaudible] and man, they,

28
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.610
you could see some effort being put into this man,

29
00:01:43.611 --> 00:01:47.390
but you also got to admit that like the 3d, some of the 3d elements,

30
00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:50.720
I was just like, God, this is ugly. But is that a good thing?

31
00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:53.000
Because that's a horror. Like I don't even know.

32
00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.190
<v 1>In 2012 it wasn't, you know, they.</v>

33
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.390
<v 0>Weren't very good. No,</v>

34
00:01:56.391 --> 00:02:01.160
it was compared to some of the 3d that came out in 2012 compared to like studio

35
00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:04.550
Gonzo, Gantz, 3d, which just makes me want to vomit.

36
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.290
When I think about it don't remind me like it was, it was good looking 3d. Yeah.

37
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.600
Church. Like you foldable put some effort into that and I,

38
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.820
and I respect them for doing that.

39
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.320
<v 1>Uh, you watched halo legends. Think you're the only person on my end.</v>

40
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.410
<v 0>I didn't even know that was an animate by halo.</v>

41
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.880
<v 1>No IP to the other 19,000 people who have rated this.</v>

42
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.120
<v 0>I think I've watched, I think I've watched,</v>

43
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.880
that was my stint when I watched that added the mass effect on him as well.

44
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.630
<v 1>What do you think you'd give halo legends? Did I say.</v>

45
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.750
<v 0>I don't think so. I didn't, I can't. I I, uh, forgone. Okay,</v>

46
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.240
good. Good. Okay.

47
00:02:43.241 --> 00:02:47.600
I stick by that because I'm on a second season one, uh, six.

48
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.210
Did I ask you? Oh, what's that about? Ooh.

49
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.260
Okay. What would you say? What would you give it?

50
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.910
I think I gave it a seven, seven or an eight. Yeah, I'll give it an April. Okay.

51
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.000
Um, I don't know why I gave it a six. I think,

52
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.610
I think it was because everyone was hyping it up and I was,

53
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.170
I want to be different. I was kind of underwhelmed by it. Um,

54
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.370
now I, cause I have rewatched your own preparation with season two. Um,

55
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.780
I would give it a seven,

56
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.860
but I remember I remember coming out of zero just feeling empty. Right.

57
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.160
And it just, it just kind, it just, no,

58
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.900
because it kind of like I had a good fun,

59
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.670
I had a good time watching it and it just, I,

60
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.150
it was just a gut reaction of it was a good time and I'm probably gonna forget

61
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:35.410
this show in a few years and it just, it's just, I didn't end up getting it.

62
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.050
So I, you also gave space dandy a six.

63
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.590
<v 1>Well, I really liked space. I really liked it to I,</v>

64
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.850
if you look at it like a Saturday morning coffee.

65
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.370
<v 0>But fun space dandy was he, it was very hit or miss for me.</v>

66
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.680
It was, you gave solid online and on.

67
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.460
I like to also seeks God's opinion.

68
00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.820
So space Danny and essay on the same one.

69
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.290
<v 1>Well, top of that, he also gave a guilty crown a five. So would you say that,</v>

70
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.740
would you say the Sao is better, better than guilty crown?

71
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.850
That Sao is better than one.

72
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.570
<v 0>[Inaudible] be a little harsh on guilty. I was a little harder than guilty,</v>

73
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.850
guilty crown. I would, I would give a higher score,

74
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.140
but going to Sao versus space dandy. I mean,

75
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.790
I rate this based on my pure enjoyment and space Stanley was either like nine on

76
00:04:26.791 --> 00:04:28.920
enjoyment or a two, depending on the episode,

77
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.520
which is probably why I rated it as six. There were some killer episodes.

78
00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:36.900
And then there was some episodes that were just a drag where I sought out on

79
00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:40.650
line was just, was just like a constant. It was, it was a plateau.

80
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.030
He was just a constant six. I watched this I'm trash. I enjoyed this, whatever,

81
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.350
move on. You know what I mean?

82
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.330
<v 1>Can to explain this one gone. Okay, Joe, Joe seven, what's up with that.</v>

83
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.083
<v 0>One. Is it the original?</v>

84
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.090
<v 1>The original one. He gave us six. Which you also watched.</v>

85
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:00.690
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

86
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.820
<v 1>You haven't rated any other jurors of a wall.</v>

87
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.010
So I'm going to take us to the Jojo series as a whole.

88
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.890
<v 0>Okay. No, I rated part one.</v>

89
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.083
[inaudible] I just wanted to get angry.

90
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.970
I just want to get riled up a little bit. You also gave a total row and eight.

91
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.770
Okay. That's wrong? I don't know what the was I thinking,

92
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.270
trying to look like that good taste. Oh my God. No, it's the four.

93
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.580
<v 1>What do you think you gave koroko basket eight. You did? Yeah.</v>

94
00:05:32.581 --> 00:05:33.930
I'm surprised. I honestly thought you would.

95
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.980
<v 0>Yeah. For some reason, I think Haiti, I love croquettes. I love CRICO and I,</v>

96
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.910
it was my,

97
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.840
it was curricula was a sports anime that got me back into sports anime. Um,

98
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.140
so no, I, I watched all of them. I

99
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.750
noticed that he gave it a four,

100
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:56.940
which I would also agree with.

101
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.930
It was just, I dunno, I liked the aesthetic and I don't know why it was just,

102
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.330
maybe I was just high that day. And I just,

103
00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.930
I was so disappointed with that because I loved the novels and then just

104
00:06:10.931 --> 00:06:15.150
completely destroyed it. It was me going through it.

105
00:06:15.151 --> 00:06:18.400
It was me after watching backroom and a gantry and go through the shelf type.

106
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.290
I'm just like, this is going to get better.

107
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.650
<v 1>I, I legitimately thought that Mexico city actors was like the gay porn novel</v>

108
00:06:26.651 --> 00:06:27.640
because of the internet,

109
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.300
because all you ever see about Macaca city action is a line.

110
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.350
It's like a day stuff. Yeah.

111
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.320
<v 0>Yeah, it is. Yeah. There's a little, there's a large Fujoshi fan base for</v>

112
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.600
[inaudible] city actors. This is a banger. I still listen to that. It's great.

113
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:41.523
All the time.

114
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.740
<v 1>Uh, what, uh, what do you think you gave him monster?</v>

115
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.950
<v 0>Did I give it a 10? You did. Okay, good.</v>

116
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.880
<v 1>Honestly, I would agree. I would stand by that love monster. Yeah. It's,</v>

117
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.740
it's one of those animates that like I dropped and then came back to. Yeah.

118
00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.040
And that I was so glad that I picked back up because it's obviously it's really

119
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.173
slow.

120
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.200
<v 0>It is really slow,</v>

121
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.270
but I feel like monster is a rarity of an anime where it's an anime that

122
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.190
has an amazing manga that could have easily be sliced up and have a

123
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:17.110
adaptation. But once there's one of the few Epic like masterpiece, Margaret,

124
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.550
they got to muskies adaptation.

125
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:23.670
So I mean like thank God it got 70 something episodes that could you imagine

126
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.030
it monster was a 24. That's why I'm scared for 20th century boys.

127
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.280
Every adapted man. Cause that's like monster,

128
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.460
but even longer and even more also, I find it hilarious.

129
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.900
[inaudible] Do you wanna explain what Towson is?

130
00:07:40.901 --> 00:07:42.610
Like imagine,

131
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.210
imagine like the show that birth shows like high school for the dead,

132
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.160
you know what I mean? It is a battle fan service show. And back in the day,

133
00:07:51.161 --> 00:07:55.540
this was the most degenerates kind of fan servicey

134
00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.190
action show. You could take so many, like we're boomers, love Iquitos.

135
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.840
It's just like, Nope, your memories. It's.

136
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.660
No, I mean, I look back now and maybe I'd rate a higher, I don't know. It's a,

137
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.980
I would rate it like maybe like a four purely because it's just so tracking back

138
00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:16.780
in, back in the day, this was all we had, you know,

139
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:21.490
nowadays there's so much trash, anime and trash kind of found surface-y shows.

140
00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:25.560
But back in the day it was kind of like icky, Towson, and then nothing.

141
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:30.570
<v 1>[Inaudible] to seven Israel.</v>

142
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:37.180
[inaudible] I'm thinking back. I'd probably give him an eight now. I, yeah,

143
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.900
I feel like I need to watch it again if you're an anxious seven as well.

144
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:46.180
I try going to nine as far as season one to six and typical

145
00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:48.820
season to a five. Okay. Yeah.

146
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.940
<v 0>I mean, I would, I rate it lower now. Honestly,</v>

147
00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:54.430
I would rate it lower now.

148
00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:00.300
It's literally like a lot it's it's one of the shows where I don't know if

149
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:03.510
the manga readers are right, because everyone talks about the Tokyo ghoul. Mark.

150
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:04.160
Has anyone.

151
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.570
<v 1>Have you guys read the Tokyo? Google Mongo. Oh, okay. Okay. So nobody knows.</v>

152
00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.000
<v 0>If the manga readers were right for Tokyo ghoul,</v>

153
00:09:11.001 --> 00:09:13.220
but apparently it's one of the most popular mango out there.

154
00:09:13.221 --> 00:09:17.780
And one of the highest rates they've done much your five go stick by that.

155
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.020
It was, it was sort of in line, but beat us all out online.

156
00:09:21.021 --> 00:09:22.790
So it's all online was like a six.

157
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.940
<v 1>Sure. So popular when it came out, I thought it was acceptable.</v>

158
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.440
I gave him maybe like a six or seven, some passionate rent there.

159
00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:33.000
I thought it was good. And you're like, I thought it was good.

160
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:38.600
He was accessible. And there was a big prison school in eight. Yeah.

161
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.920
Yeah. I stand by that prison. School is one of the most.

162
00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.820
<v 0>Like disregarding the ending of the Margot.</v>

163
00:09:46.821 --> 00:09:48.920
It is one of the most hilarious Mongols I've met.

164
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.760
I've read the anime adaptation did a pretty good job.

165
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:57.170
<v 1>For five. Yeah. I wasn't sure if I should comment on that.</v>

166
00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.780
I was offended by that and I'm pretty mad at him. I've never watched this.

167
00:09:59.781 --> 00:10:02.540
I have no idea. I'm curious. Psychopaths a seven.

168
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:07.100
<v 0>Yeah. Season one. Really? Really? No better. No, it's a nine now.</v>

169
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.800
<v 1>Okay. [inaudible].</v>

170
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.050
<v 0>Psychopaths is one of those few shows that has stuck with me and it's,</v>

171
00:10:14.051 --> 00:10:18.920
it's one of the shows where I rewatched it and I loved

172
00:10:18.921 --> 00:10:21.860
it way more rewatching it than I've watched the first time. Cause I think.

173
00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.500
<v 1>So good. I think I didn't.</v>

174
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.140
<v 0>Appreciate psychopaths the first time I watched it,</v>

175
00:10:27.141 --> 00:10:29.820
but the more I watched like a pass, the more I'm just like now,

176
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:34.010
like I gave it a seven when I first watched it. And when I was doing my,

177
00:10:34.011 --> 00:10:38.360
when I was thinking back to like my top 10 favorite anime of the decade of the

178
00:10:38.361 --> 00:10:40.940
2010s psychopaths was up there. Oh yeah. It's definitely.

179
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.290
Cause it still has some,

180
00:10:42.291 --> 00:10:44.600
like the villain was one of the best villains in the anime.

181
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:49.580
It still has some of the most unique ideas that I've seen an animate that has

182
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.650
stuck with me. And I don't think has aged at all. Um, yeah, like the,

183
00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:59.540
like the scene halfway through where the main character has to make a

184
00:10:59.541 --> 00:11:02.900
choice that that is, has stuck with me for a long time.

185
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:06.200
And the one scene that has also stuck with me is, um,

186
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.600
I can't remember what exactly what episode it is,

187
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.900
but it's the episode where this,

188
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.530
they start beating the out of this character in like the middle of the street.

189
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.800
Right. And because of the system that's been set up,

190
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.120
no one reacts just because they they've never seen something like this.

191
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:28.490
And I dunno, I thought that was like such a unique idea like that has,

192
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:32.930
that was completely natural in this world that Gaynor Bucci has built. Um,

193
00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.810
it's I think it's unfortunate. The world building is like amazing.

194
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:36.980
I think it's unfortunate.

195
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:41.030
I think the biggest unfortunate thing is that season two and I haven't watched

196
00:11:41.031 --> 00:11:41.810
season three yet,

197
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:46.340
but they just didn't have as interesting ideas as Wars in season one. But yeah.

198
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:50.660
<v 1>You, when you have like a giant karma taught to like, you know, follow up.</v>
