00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.280
<v 0>So you've always been on to speak Japanese since a young age.</v>

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.480
<v 1>Uh, with my mother. And, uh, so yes, I learned, I did.</v>

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.430
I don't know if I can say I learned, but I.

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.840
<v 0>Like, you just know it [inaudible].</v>

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.820
<v 1>Was a drama with movies and my mother and some of my family, uh, that, uh,</v>

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.180
like I said, it's you, it's a family language, right?

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.730
So when you have to work,

8
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.410
you use a bit another Japanese language, we teach Cagle.

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.450
And so yes, you.

10
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.120
<v 0>Said, can you go was like very formal Japanese.</v>

11
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.170
<v 1>Former, when you have to spoke with your senpai, with your boss,</v>

12
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.280
it's a different, you have to put your interpreter up and you down.

13
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:42.260
<v 2>Basically,</v>

14
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.800
basically it's the bane of every like person trying to learn Japanese. Right?

15
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.170
Like, it's like,

16
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.150
it's smooth sailing until you hit Kago and then everyone's like,

17
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.060
oh no, trust me, off. If you think it's hard. Now, Katie, just.

18
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.390
<v 0>Given up on the thought of ever I'm like, I I'm. Okay.</v>

19
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:00.890
<v 2>Because I thought that as well.</v>

20
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.960
Cause I kind of was the same thing where I'd like, you know,

21
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.750
I don't speak K go to my parents. I don't think any kid does.

22
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.670
So I had to learn got on the job when I first started, like, you know, uh,

23
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.170
part-time jobs in Japan. And I was like, I thought I knew Japanese.

24
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.270
I'm told I had to start using it just through every conception about Japanese

25
00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:20.960
out the windows.

26
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.290
<v 0>Is there any comparison? That's even close to English with Kagan.</v>

27
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.060
<v 2>Um, it's like, oh man, I don't know what, is there a comparison?</v>

28
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.040
What would it be? Like trying to speak.

29
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.660
<v 0>Like a very old, like very Porsche and kind of, it's.</v>

30
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.700
<v 2>Kinda like, it's kinda like going from only learning internet slang till finding</v>

31
00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:44.240
Shakespeare. Yeah. It's it's like it's, it's basically another.

32
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.680
So you have to learn to speak in cursive. These codes.

33
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.310
We literally like it's it's like a Shakespeare play, you know?

34
00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:55.550
When did like translation is it's basically that.

35
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.770
<v 0>I saw there was like Japanese cursive. Is there like yeah, I showed it.</v>

36
00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:03.980
Someone was writing Japanese and corrosive or maybe like, like calligraphy,

37
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:05.240
right? No, no, no. Like legit,

38
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.880
like it was like a doctor's note someone had showed me. Oh.

39
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.400
<v 2>No. Do it. Like every time I have to go to the doctor to see I'm just like,</v>

40
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.940
I might as well die, but I can't read this note. That's.

41
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.090
<v 0>Good to hear that, that transcends language that doctors just can't write for.</v>

42
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.370
Somehow.

43
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.580
<v 2>That's universal. Right? Kanji was hard,</v>

44
00:02:22.581 --> 00:02:25.100
but you go in cursive Kanji and I'm like, come on.

45
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:29.870
[inaudible] actuary.

46
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.340
<v 1>When you have some animators, you have some notes of my senpai on paper. I,</v>

47
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.450
I try to because.

48
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.190
<v 0>What did he do? Yeah.</v>

49
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.190
<v 1>I have to do coding. It takes too much, too much time.</v>

50
00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:48.350
So I go to my senpai story. What do you do?

51
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.830
<v 2>What did you the physician's easy to ask. Isn't it? Yeah.</v>
