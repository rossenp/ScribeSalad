1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.390
<v 0>We just come out of our Christmas and new year's I guess.</v>

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.680
<v 1>Break. Yeah, because it didn't really feel like.</v>

3
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.040
<v 0>No, no, it's never really a Christmas holiday for YouTube,</v>

4
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.550
because I feel like we we've talked about this many times before,

5
00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:16.550
but we'd never, we are very bad at taking breaks. If anything,

6
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:17.690
it's like the last minute.

7
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.550
<v 1>Grind. Right. We do at the end of the year.</v>

8
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.600
<v 0>I mean, I've just been watching a ton of anime because it's the end of the year.</v>

9
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.520
This is like my one time with a year where I actually just sit down and just

10
00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:29.600
catch up to the year.

11
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.650
<v 1>Cause you don't feel bad. Right.</v>

12
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.870
Because you know that everyone's not like doing anything

13
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.580
bad for like just binge in a few shots. Right? Exactly. What did you binge on?

14
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.503
What did you watch?

15
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.410
<v 0>Most of everything I missed in 2020.</v>

16
00:00:42.411 --> 00:00:44.480
So I watched a [inaudible]. It was so good if you watch that yet. No.

17
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.520
<v 1>Oh, it's so good. And I don't want you to get away.</v>

18
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.880
Have you met them longer? At least really good.

19
00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:59.090
Like I was going into it thinking like we just got to get like a F like every

20
00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:02.420
year there's everyone's like, dude, this is the, and it's going to replace that.

21
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.100
That's what I've just been hearing that. Yeah.

22
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.050
<v 0>They said that about Dr. Star.</v>

23
00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:08.540
And they said that about a lot of shows last couple of years. And I'm just like,

24
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.930
yeah.

25
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.480
<v 1>Did you say Carson is where I've actually got like a chop watching it?</v>

26
00:01:11.481 --> 00:01:14.300
Like I'm actually, yeah. I'm actually like hyped, like see where it goes.

27
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.470
<v 0>It's a show that is just, it just knows what he's doing.</v>

28
00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:22.100
And it's obviously been influenced from previous Shonan, but my God,

29
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.560
it's just doing everything that it needs to do. Right.

30
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.080
All I've heard is that if you watch the anime,

31
00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:29.380
it basically does everything the manga does.

32
00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:33.020
So it just makes the Monga obsolete. Great. Yeah. I mean, that was just,

33
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.100
that was just demon Slayer, right?

34
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.880
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. I want, I want no Mongo get rid of Mongo.</v>

35
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.220
I'm sick and tired of these.

36
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.550
I was like this man's done like entire monger reading streams before.

37
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.350
I'm about ready to throw hands right now. Exactly. Monga readers,

38
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.010
constantly playing the same card. Right? What is that called? Going to get old.

39
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.100
How many times can you use the, I've read the Monga. Oh, I use it all the. Yeah.

40
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.150
How many times can you use it before? You're just an. I just don't care.

41
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.620
I think a lot of margaritas just don't care. I mean it,

42
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.240
so everyone just says the jujitsu Kyson animators. Exactly.

43
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.890
<v 0>The enemy does everything the Monga does, but betel yeah. I mean,</v>

44
00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:15.400
from what I understand, that's just a lot of [inaudible].

45
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.870
<v 1>The way to go there. I mean, demon Slade.</v>

46
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.600
<v 0>Did it, you know, and the Taiwan times doing it. Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.630
<v 1>Like I don't understand why there was even a thing of, let's just,</v>

48
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.420
let's just change the story unless that, you know, haven't been adapted yet.

49
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.320
Right? Like it hadn't been sorry, finished yet. Sorry. Um, why,

50
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.190
why even changed the story in my mind? Whenever everyone love this thing.

51
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.200
So everyone's like, yeah, everyone loves this show. Let's just change it.

52
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.651
<v 0>I mean,</v>

53
00:02:36.651 --> 00:02:40.700
I feel like you've started watching anime after the period where there was like

54
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:45.110
so many animate adaptations that just around with the Monga and the story

55
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.630
that you forgotten that this was a legitimate,

56
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.140
like selling points where we had a Monga that followed.

57
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.500
<v 1>I mean, we had an animal. I understand why they did it.</v>

58
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.820
I'm pretty like I'm in the nineties or eighties where the nineties shun and jump

59
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.160
of patient's right. Where it's just like.

60
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.780
<v 0>Oh no, I like this Mongo.</v>

61
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.370
<v 1>Imagine the producers were just like, I'm sick and tired of these Monga.</v>

62
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.310
Rita's on their high horse. You know what? I'm a them over and make a song.

63
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.310
They can't say, Oh, I know what happens. That's probably why,

64
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.280
because they probably like brought the Monga readers to the screenings.

65
00:03:14.281 --> 00:03:17.100
They were like, yeah. You know, what's going to, you know.

66
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.560
<v 0>No, if anything, it made the Munger read a little better.</v>

67
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.450
Cause then the animate watches would be like, well,

68
00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:23.850
I've heard from the margarita is that this enemy is pretty good.

69
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.930
And then they go and they're like.

70
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.810
<v 2>So what happens in the Mongo? Okay. Could you, could you tell us,</v>

71
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.730
could you tell us, we really want to.

72
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.080
<v 0>We're interested now finally paradise. No, but do,</v>

73
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.040
do you find that like the older you get the less animated,

74
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.840
like the less animated that you watch,

75
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.720
but the more manga that you read right now?

76
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.630
I feel like that's like the path of every animal.

77
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.570
<v 1>Maybe I'm not old enough yet. I don't know. I haven't got that yet.</v>

78
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.770
<v 0>Let me go. Like what? So like it's 25.</v>

79
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.050
It was around your age.

80
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.670
<v 2>Like monk is a thing really? Yeah. At 24. Yeah.</v>

81
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.500
Well she didn't start reading manga properly. Like.

82
00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.911
<v 0>Pretty much all my life.</v>

83
00:03:59.911 --> 00:04:02.310
But the thing is like up on toll around like a couple of years ago,

84
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.480
I would be like very heavily, like, I'd say like 80, 20 enemy Mongo,

85
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.650
but now it's like kind of flipped around. I'm like 80, 20 Munga to animated.

86
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.040
Because you just realize that reading Monga is basically watching anime,

87
00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:16.320
but just more optimized. It's basically the speed.

88
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.260
One version of watching anime. Right? So voice acting,

89
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.970
no music do this myself. Like the only,

90
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.110
the only pod where it could like potentially up is like on the author. Right.

91
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.000
There's like no second hand. It's just like pure story. Right. You know,

92
00:04:33.001 --> 00:04:36.030
you don't need, you don't need anything else, but just the pure story.

93
00:04:36.031 --> 00:04:39.900
And sometimes there's only one person to blame if it sucks because it's like,

94
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.620
you don't.

95
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.720
<v 1>No what you're missing out because you never think about it.</v>

96
00:04:42.721 --> 00:04:45.270
Like you would never I'll keep coming back to it.

97
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.270
You don't know that you need a Jordan or steam in your life until you had

98
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.590
Giordano's theme in your life. Right.

99
00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:51.390
Like part five was amazing without Jordan as theme.

100
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.680
<v 0>But they'll pop off. Has Jordanaires 10 times you read the manga.</v>

101
00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.100
<v 1>And I think the animal is better. Yeah.</v>

102
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.500
<v 0>Yeah. No, no. We can agree with, is that okay? We all agree with that.</v>

103
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.830
I was like, wait, I was giving it a second to sit there. I'm like, all right,

104
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.760
I'm waiting for the fans. Like I like Joe Joe's by the way,

105
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.680
I haven't seen all the pot five yet,

106
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.380
but the little that I have seen is like already better than the Maga,

107
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.750
but not to say, but that's not to say that.

108
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.860
<v 1>This is a very rare case where I feel like a legendary Monga has been adapted</v>

109
00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:23.430
into a legendary animation and we don't get many of those.

110
00:05:23.431 --> 00:05:24.890
I think it's always one or the other.
