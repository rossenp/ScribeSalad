1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.650
<v 0>Are you guys watching anything else this season?</v>

2
00:00:01.651 --> 00:00:06.480
Or are you guys waiting to see what gets hype? And we'll get one to watch,

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.000
uh, what the called one drag priority. That is one direct priority. Yeah.

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.020
Weirdest, title. But I watched the trailer on it because I heard so many people,

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.480
a lot of people were asking me like, Hey, have you seen the first episode? This,

6
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:20.970
I was like, that doesn't even sound like a real enemy.

7
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.740
<v 1>One direct wondering party that that sounds made up.</v>

8
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:25.850
But then I checked out the tree.

9
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.220
<v 0>I was like, actually, this kind of looks fire. Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.140
It's it's too early to tell how it's going to go because I've watched the first

11
00:00:33.141 --> 00:00:37.880
episode about that is it's, it's one of those shows where I'm just like,

12
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.133
I don't even know.

13
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.900
<v 1>And I mean, it's, it's one of those weird I'll wait, I'll wait. I ask people.</v>

14
00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:45.610
I was like, what's this?

15
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.990
<v 0>And people just said, just watch it. It feels like a,</v>

16
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.330
like an eco horror show or something like that. Don't like,

17
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.480
Sarah's on my or something or something like that. I'm just,

18
00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:55.050
I'm just throwing out words. I kind of just like.

19
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.020
<v 1>You could be speaking in tongues right now. What the?</v>

20
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.910
<v 0>A slight light tatami galaxy vibe to it, you know, like kind of just like,</v>

21
00:01:01.911 --> 00:01:06.200
it's like so strange that it's hard to describe five to it. What I,

22
00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:09.680
what I will say it, it feels like, it feels like Madoka,

23
00:01:09.681 --> 00:01:13.630
Magica directed by Ihara. Um, it's, it's really the you guys.

24
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.400
So you can hire is the director that made Sarah [inaudible], uh,

25
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.400
 penguin drum. Um,  what else has he made? What else has he for hire made melee

26
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.400
? What's that magical girl? One day doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. You don't, you've not seen any of his 

27
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.400
works

28
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.400
. Right. But he makes a lot of weird stuff and it's I watched the first episode and it's the, 

29
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.400
what I will say. I can't really sport

30
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.400
 with it because I don't even understand the first episode. You know what I mean? But it's a story that it presents the events of this world out of order. Right? So you get, Oh my God. I'm like 

31
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.233
racking my brain to.

32
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.220
<v 1>Figure out how I can describe it's kind.</v>

33
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.900
<v 0>Of presented story, like, uh,</v>

34
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.100
like a boogie pot Phantom kind of it's it is very reminiscent of biggie.

35
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.490
<v 1>I just realized like, if you have no context of what you're talking about,</v>

36
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.200
actually just sounds like you guys are talking about jibberish.

37
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.520
What's the weirdest.

38
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.280
<v 0>You've watched on away. Just now.</v>

39
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.130
<v 1>Like a lot of the, when people like, dude, you got to wash this animates.</v>

40
00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:10.964
So it's cool.

41
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.430
<v 0>On the same vein as serial experiments lane boogie, pop Phantom. I,</v>

42
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.360
I feel like you just, haven't watched.

43
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.060
<v 1>She wants you put those shows on you're like,</v>

44
00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:23.630
there's no way you could enjoy this without doing like four tabs of acid.

45
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.440
You know what I mean?

46
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.100
Like a lot of shows are like that and then we them with experiments.

47
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.920
<v 0>But I'd argue that like something like boogie ball Phantom is</v>

48
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.130
I don't really concern myself with it. I mean,

49
00:02:34.131 --> 00:02:37.970
it's something where you have to be in a very specific mood to enjoy it because

50
00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:41.350
it's not something you can just put on and just enjoy it as an insane,

51
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.140
as like a coherent story or something. But what I will say is out of,

52
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.350
because I put my season on video, I watch every,

53
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.950
the first two episodes of like every new anime and out of everything I watched,

54
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.640
it's the one where I watched it didn't know what was going on.

55
00:02:55.641 --> 00:03:00.250
Didn't fully understand it, but I, it stuck with me. You, it, it, it really,

56
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.720
it was really the one where I kept thinking about it after it had ended,

57
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:08.950
after I'd watched everything else. I was just like, nah, I dunno what it is.

58
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:10.810
But I keep thinking about wondering priority.

59
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:15.070
And I don't know what it is exactly about wondering priority that makes me

60
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.060
latch onto it. But there's something, I feel something special.

61
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.910
I get that I kind of, I kind of got that same feeling.

62
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:25.090
The first time I watched like the first episode of like fully coli, right?

63
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:28.870
It's like, I dunno what the is happening. Like the student's forehead,

64
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:30.070
little robot just came out of.

65
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.050
I can give you a play-by-play of what happens in one Dereck.

66
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.560
So this girl there's this like short hooded,

67
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.250
like she wears like a yellow hoodie girl. Um,

68
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.100
the first scene is there a Cicada comes along and starts talking to her and

69
00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:51.310
you're like, okay, whatever cool. She can talk to cicadas.

70
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.350
And then she gets given an egg and then she wonders what to do with this egg.

71
00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:59.440
And then she's sitting on the toilet and then toilet paper starts talking to her

72
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.590
and she's like, yo, what the? And then the egg hatches.

73
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:05.530
And it turns out that it's a go hatches out the egg.

74
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.650
<v 1>I think I'll just watch. I don't want to spoil too much,</v>

75
00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:12.570
but that's what was fun. I mean, if, if it, you know,

76
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.790
if the weeks go on and everyone's still like, yeah, it's a good show.

77
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.720
<v 0>Yeah, sure. I mean, I, from what I can understand about the first episode,</v>

78
00:04:18.721 --> 00:04:22.170
it deals with a lot of themes of depression and suicide.

79
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.300
And it seems like it's a, it,

80
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.620
we get glimpses into our backstory because you know, we get glimpses into,

81
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.710
is, is this a dream world?

82
00:04:31.711 --> 00:04:35.190
Or is this an imagining things or what's kind of going on where we only get

83
00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:37.530
hints at everything. I feel like, again, it's like,

84
00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:40.200
it's kind of like a modern spin on fully coli, right? Cause like fully cool.

85
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.460
It's kind of the same where it's like,

86
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.290
it kind of used it to like absurd imagery to present deeper meanings.

87
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.670
Like I said,

88
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.360
it's way too early to tell what the show is going to be about and how good it

89
00:04:51.361 --> 00:04:55.770
is. But like I said, out of everything, I watch it stuck out to me the most.

90
00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.490
That's the one I thought about the most. Um,

91
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.190
but I don't know if you wouldn't want to say the weirdest enemy you've seen.

92
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.910
I don't.

93
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.070
<v 1>Man, I think you'd have to go through my lace, but.</v>

94
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.080
<v 0>That was pretty tough that we did that last week.</v>

95
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.370
Or it was pretty some on there that I like,

96
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.580
have you ever watched an anime or a show? And you're just like,

97
00:05:11.581 --> 00:05:15.390
what the did I just watch that made zero sense to me? Like kinda like,

98
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.940
like not in like the vein of like, you know, this was kind of thing,

99
00:05:17.941 --> 00:05:22.830
but like just genuinely the storytelling was so like on the same

100
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.950
lines as the ending of Evangelian or like a, you know,

101
00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:27.210
like a take on concrete or something.

102
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.150
<v 1>The first time I watched Stephen galleon, I was like, I don't, what the</v>

103
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.400
I was like, Oh, that's how they're going to end it. And like, you know,

104
00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:38.150
some people love finding the deeper meaning in that. And I'm just like,

105
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.090
that was a bit. I'm just gonna get on with my life. I just,

106
00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:46.230
I just really concerned me. I just, I wish I cared, but I, I don't.

107
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.450
And then like maybe a video about my recommendation.

108
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.490
<v 0>Monkey bar activation. Yeah.</v>

109
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.600
<v 1>I think I've like programmed my brain to like, just make my life easier.</v>

110
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.740
So like, when I want to just you stuff like that,

111
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.610
but it might drive some people mad. I'm just like monkey, forget monkey,

112
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:03.290
move on. I just find it funny. How, like,

113
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:06.320
considering like in a previous episode you said like how you love to challenge

114
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:09.590
yourself every day. You definitely do not like to challenge yourself on anime,

115
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:10.760
but like, what is,

116
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.570
what is thinking about the end of Ethan galleon challenging year in any way?

117
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.420
How was that? Well, not necessarily innovative, but like, you know,

118
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:19.160
something like, you know, like a fully Coolio,

119
00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:22.270
like a take on King where it's like, there are deeper meanings behind

120
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.030
[inaudible]

121
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.030
, here's the thing where you watch it once and you can't get everything. You, you can't enjoy watching it 

122
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.863
once, but like, why would that challenge you? There.

123
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.290
<v 0>Is a challenge as in like, it makes.</v>

124
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:41.240
<v 1>You think about its themes more and kind of challenges your,</v>

125
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:45.070
I guess like perception of how you like consume it.

126
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.910
<v 0>I guess it's hard to describe like, it, it, it challenges,</v>

127
00:06:47.911 --> 00:06:52.540
challenges off. It's like,

128
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:53.503
I broke them.

129
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.510
<v 1>When I watched those things. Right. It's like the deeper meaning everything.</v>

130
00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.200
Yeah. More often than not, like I realized that that that's what they're doing.

131
00:07:02.201 --> 00:07:04.630
And I'm like, Oh, okay, cool. And then I'll just, I'll let go.

132
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.580
And Google and I'll be like, what were they trying to say?

133
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.250
<v 0>But like, don't you like? Cause I find like some.</v>

134
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.910
<v 1>Enjoyment in kind of watching it and trying to figure it out myself.</v>

135
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.610
You know what I mean? I got a good way to,

136
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.590
it's like unraveling a puzzle by yourself and it's like playing a puzzle game.

137
00:07:20.591 --> 00:07:23.140
Right. You'll you'll give him the pieces and you know,

138
00:07:23.141 --> 00:07:24.790
you're not told what the right answer is,

139
00:07:24.791 --> 00:07:29.050
but it's up to you and it's up to you to unravel it yourself.

140
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:30.791
It's more like,

141
00:07:30.791 --> 00:07:34.870
it's more like you've given a bunch of pieces and as you're playing around with

142
00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:38.830
the pieces, you realize that it's a puzzle that can't be solved. This is like,

143
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.210
I love map. Right.

144
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.800
Because there is a problem and it is always very clearly defined as such. Right.

145
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.630
It's not logical with like yeah. With stories and all that kind of stuff.

146
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.790
It's I don't like that. I have to figure out what this guy was thinking. Yeah.

147
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.440
Like sometimes I might get a meaning that is not even remotely close to what he

148
00:07:59.441 --> 00:08:02.050
was thinking or the author was thinking when they were writing the thing down.

149
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:02.681
And to me,

150
00:08:02.681 --> 00:08:07.030
that bothers me that I can just wildly get the answer wrong and I'll never be

151
00:08:07.031 --> 00:08:10.810
corrected. I don't like that. But you assume that that there's a right answer.

152
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:11.770
Well,

153
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.770
what if he didn't know there was a right answer and that's the problem is that I

154
00:08:14.771 --> 00:08:18.370
don't like that when there's just like an interpretation and it's like,

155
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.080
you just make up what you want. And then it's like, then what?

156
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.410
<v 0>I would argue that a great story.</v>

157
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:27.760
<v 1>Can still entertain you in that aspect of whether it is the actual correct</v>

158
00:08:27.761 --> 00:08:29.050
answer or not. Yeah. I mean, I don't,

159
00:08:29.051 --> 00:08:33.010
I don't really go around like think about it much, I guess. That's I just,

160
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.980
I watch it and I, I like whatever thoughts I have when I finish. I'm like,

161
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.390
all right, cool. Yeah. That's what I'm going to leave with.

162
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:38.531
And most of the time,

163
00:08:38.531 --> 00:08:41.800
I don't really care to try and find the deeper meaning in it. Um,

164
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.760
and so I think, again, I know this is like, that's such monkey brain.

165
00:08:45.761 --> 00:08:47.890
You can't appreciate fine all et cetera, et cetera.

166
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.660
But I'd say that's even more normal. I, yeah, at the end of the day,

167
00:08:52.661 --> 00:08:53.590
I just don't care.

168
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.290
<v 0>I think people, me who like actually like trying to find the deeper meaning.</v>

169
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:00.150
I think we are the minority. Yeah.

170
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.240
I think I'm the minority here because I talk about, I,

171
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.860
the reason I value this so much is because there has been time where like a

172
00:09:07.861 --> 00:09:11.550
piece of media has literally affected sometimes the way I think,

173
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:15.900
or the way I view life. So, because I know it can have that effect.

174
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.140
I, you know, I try to search it out whenever I can.

175
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:23.250
Whenever I find that there might be even a glimpse that there might be a deeper

176
00:09:23.251 --> 00:09:24.350
meaning I love going.

177
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.380
<v 1>I don't know. I just like, I like everything to be efficient.</v>

178
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.470
I like everything to be Don [inaudible].

179
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:31.880
<v 0>No.</v>

180
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.080
<v 1>No, not at all. I like,</v>

181
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.740
I like it when things are very clearly defined the rules. Like this is why,

182
00:09:36.741 --> 00:09:40.910
like, I always, like, I never ever did any artistic subjects in school, right?

183
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.350
Yeah. I don't like how it's all,

184
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:45.320
it's all like a mess and it's totally interpretation. Yeah.

185
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.730
I like how in math and physics and life, the rules, they make sense.

186
00:09:49.731 --> 00:09:52.280
And you can, you can like take them in and you can like,

187
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.880
like math and physics were my favorite tool. But for me,

188
00:09:55.881 --> 00:10:00.230
it's not fun when I'm like reading a book or something and I'm doing this and

189
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.990
I'm, I'm just being presented with a bunch of nonsense that I'm, uh,

190
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.370
I have to make sense of myself.

191
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.360
<v 0>I would argue then that if it's a bunch of nonsense without an interpretation,</v>

192
00:10:08.361 --> 00:10:09.380
then that's just a bad story.

193
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:12.000
<v 1>Sometimes. Yeah. I mean, sometimes you can make your own,</v>

194
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.170
you can make your own thoughts up from what I was being presented to you and you

195
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.930
just kind of like, cool. Alright, nice.

196
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.500
I came up with what I think happened and then it's like, all right, well,

197
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:22.363
that's what I think.

198
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.300
<v 0>I would argue that like the best stories are the ones where you can read it.</v>

199
00:10:26.301 --> 00:10:28.640
Like someone, like you can read it where like,

200
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.490
you don't have to even think about the fact that there might possibly be a

201
00:10:31.491 --> 00:10:33.980
deeper meaning and it's still enjoyable. And at the same time,

202
00:10:33.981 --> 00:10:37.130
people like me that like to look for deeper meanings can also enjoy it.

203
00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.190
Like once you get too philosophical, but you know, why,

204
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.710
why do we watch entertainment is to feel things

205
00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:47.050
[inaudible], that's the end. We'll be all right. We, we watch entertaining

206
00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:47.050
 to make us feel something, whatever you want to feel, whether it's like adrenaline, sometimes you just want to feel depressed or whatever, you know, 

207
00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:47.050
it's and watching something like, for example, the ending episode of the van 

208
00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:47.050
galleon I've I remember first time I've watched it. I hated it because

209
00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:47.050
 I'm just like, why, why can I not just be given the answer? Why, why is the answer? Not just, you know, being presented to me on like a golden platter, 

210
00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:47.050
you know

211
00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:47.050
, that's what I wanted. And then as I grew older and I, it stuck with me and I've rewatched it and I'm just like, 

212
00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:47.883
Oh, this is, this is making me feel different things.

213
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:29.600
<v 1>Sure. In future, maybe I'll change my mind on it. But right now for me, uh,</v>

214
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.400
like entertainment and media, it's just like,

215
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.730
I just want to relax and thinking is not relaxing.

216
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.560
I just want to get on with it because I'm working so much.

217
00:11:39.561 --> 00:11:41.480
And I just want to do the things I want to do. And to me,

218
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.620
and detainment is purely like a gas stop on my destination. It's like,

219
00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:47.600
let's just stop for a moment and have some fun. Yeah.

220
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.730
<v 0>I mean, I get that too. Like,</v>

221
00:11:49.731 --> 00:11:53.830
it's not like every pieces of excitement I watch is like mind bending.

222
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:55.031
Like it's, like I said,

223
00:11:55.031 --> 00:11:58.840
sometimes you just need to be in a very specific mood to enjoy this piece of

224
00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:02.690
media. I'm just like, you know what? I want to feel pretentious right now. Like,

225
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.080
I kind of want to like figure out if this, as a deep opinion.

226
00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.420
<v 1>I, I, when I speak to people who talk like that about the media, they like,</v>

227
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.630
I'm like, you know, part of me is envious because I don't care for that.

228
00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:14.910
But because I think a lot of people are envious of that.

229
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.260
Cause I think when you meet a lot of people,

230
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.470
they'll claim that they can see to find a meaning and all of that.

231
00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:24.090
And most of the time they have no idea. Um, but you know, I don't know.

232
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.210
I'm just completely open with the fact that I'm like, I don't care.

233
00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.070
I don't catch a cat. Yeah.

234
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:29.970
<v 0>I mean, what I like,</v>

235
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.710
what I don't understand is the other extreme where it's people who can't

236
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.940
seem to enjoy media, unless there is something deeper about it. Like, I,

237
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:43.170
there are times when I just want to watch a ISA call and just not have to think,

238
00:12:43.171 --> 00:12:44.310
you know what I mean? Yeah.

239
00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:47.490
And I guess it's like the people who like think that every single piece of

240
00:12:47.491 --> 00:12:50.460
entertainment or media has some kind of deeper meaning under it.

241
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.050
You know what I mean? It's like, no, uh, animate review, a non,

242
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:58.470
non Bre has no deeper meaning. It's just a slice of life. Like just, just chill.

243
00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:00.720
<v 1>Privileged the problem. It's like,</v>

244
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.950
my only problem is life in life is that my media that I consume doesn't have

245
00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:05.390
enough.

246
00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.440
<v 0>Meaningless. It's like, it's like, Oh my how.</v>

247
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.530
<v 1>Privileged I used to be where that's a concern, you know what I mean? Like.</v>

248
00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:12.690
<v 0>That's like the biggest.</v>

249
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.540
<v 1>First of all, problem where like, you can't get enough fine art.</v>

250
00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:17.640
<v 0>You know what I mean? That's like,</v>

251
00:13:17.641 --> 00:13:21.750
literally like billionaire probably me off even more. It's like,

252
00:13:21.751 --> 00:13:24.420
you can have your own interpretation for media. Right? That's, that's,

253
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.370
that's very normal for everything.

254
00:13:26.371 --> 00:13:30.540
But what me off is when people project their own meaning

255
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.560
onto this piece of media. And like, like I remember,

256
00:13:34.561 --> 00:13:38.130
I remember where the Saquon Tyson, when, you know, the basement thing happened.

257
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:39.870
And then there were articles to be like, Oh yeah,

258
00:13:39.871 --> 00:13:44.790
this is promoting Nazi-ism and stuff like that. And I'm just like, Oh, it's not,

259
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.030
Oh God, he gets, he gets to a point where there's a difference between,

260
00:13:48.031 --> 00:13:53.030
you know, analyzing it and interpreting in your own way. And just the,

261
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.520
even when they know the right answer as well, right. It's just like, no, no,

262
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.400
I don't care what the author says. This is what it actually means.

263
00:13:59.401 --> 00:14:01.440
He just doesn't know it yet. It's like, no,

264
00:14:01.441 --> 00:14:04.320
I'm pretty sure if the author said that this is what it means.

265
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:05.580
That's what a means.

266
00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.800
<v 1>Well, it's, I mean, there's plenty of cases of wildlife.</v>

267
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.540
The orthopedist has control over.

268
00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:12.000
<v 0>Well, I mean, isn't that like the whole thing with Ava, right?</v>

269
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.600
Where like the frog grip, the death of the author or whatever.
