WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.880
<v 0>What's uh, how are you guys doing? How are you boys doing?</v>

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.980
<v 1>Since last week we spoke about Claymore and I was like, it. I'll reclaim all.</v>

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.350
And it was really good. You literally just finished it like.

4
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.180
<v 0>Yeah, two minutes before we started recording.</v>

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.990
<v 1>If you haven't read clay morning, I think about it. Don't worry about it.</v>

6
00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:16.370
You don't even know anything. Uh, Mt.

7
00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:19.100
Was good until the halfway and then it kinda just goes a bit. Yeah.

8
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.600
<v 0>Yeah, definitely. Yeah. I feel like a lot of animation.</v>

9
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.370
<v 1>Do this where they build up like this amazing world that I think is too big of a</v>

10
00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:31.250
scope. And then they just let like, we need to finish this.

11
00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:33.830
Like within like 200 chapters. How do we do that?

12
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.040
<v 2>Yeah. Well I think for a lot of the times,</v>

13
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.420
at least with like Sean and John cause claim was from Shawnee job.

14
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.500
A lot of the times the authors don't really have a choice as to how long he goes

15
00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:43.334
for. Right.

16
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.330
<v 0>Shannon jump goes through the same problem. As, you know,</v>

17
00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:50.840
a lot of American TV shows where, you know, you have some like rare,

18
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.880
like something like breaking bad, for example,

19
00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:55.460
it's like a rarity where a show just gets better.

20
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.910
It hits its peak and then it stops, you know what I mean? But the problem with,

21
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.070
yeah, kind of like a spinoff, I think medical school's better than breaking bad

22
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.100
[inaudible] but uh, yeah, the problem with it, all of it like Shannon,

23
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.760
John manga,

24
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.230
is that the most of the time that you either go on for too short or they get

25
00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:21.840
dragged out,

26
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.970
you either you're either like a bleach or you are something that gets canceled

27
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.850
early. Like most other shown and jump shows. That's the thing.

28
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.770
<v 2>Right? Is that like with Sean and jump,</v>

29
00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:35.330
they have every month they have rankings and if you have even just a slight dip

30
00:01:35.331 --> 00:01:38.600
in popularity, then they're kind of just like, well.

31
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.470
<v 0>Time to wrap it up boy. And he also was like, well, I just, I just got started.</v>

32
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.010
It's it doesn't matter. I got to wrap it up. I'm wondering.

33
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.570
<v 1>That's what happened. But to be fair,</v>

34
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.800
when I was reading this it's 150 chapters around, like the 80th is, I was like,

35
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.860
ah, yeah, this isn't going to end like great ended.

36
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.840
<v 2>Better than most. Well, I mean, you know yeah.</v>

37
00:01:56.841 --> 00:01:58.250
It's better than like what happened to like you.

38
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.620
<v 0>Harsher, right? Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Like the last.</v>

39
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.600
<v 2>Doctors go completely got it.</v>

40
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:04.520
<v 0>You can tell when an,</v>

41
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.240
when an author just like has to wrap things up in five chapters or something,

42
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.880
and you're just like some, some,

43
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.480
some stuff that they've been building up for like a hundred to 200 chapters just

44
00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:17.900
gets wrapped up in 10 chapters. What the? Who is this?

45
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.760
<v 1>Like the opposite of that with, uh, what's the monger cover hunt article.</v>

46
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.160
He introduces like the dark continent when he can't make one chapter.

47
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.263
And he's like, huh.

48
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.660
<v 2>Expand the world. Tenfold. I, uh, I tweeted out about it the other day,</v>

49
00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:37.220
but I found out the other day that in the span that it took togarashi to release

50
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.080
chap a volume 32 to 33 assassination classroom started and ended

51
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.483
my God.

52
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.690
<v 1>No Hunter. Hunter has been on hiatus, not hiatus. Basically.</v>

53
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.130
We had a chapter like once every two weeks.

54
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.100
<v 0>No, it's definitely a hiatus. We got a check one time.</v>

55
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.600
<v 2>H X, H is short for hiatus. What counts as that.</v>

56
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.850
<v 0>Hiatus nowadays is, is it like a Hunter, Hunter hiatus or bezerk?</v>

57
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.790
Muira hiatus. I mean, that's kind of the same thing. It's just like, maybe it's,

58
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.430
there's a very slow release schedule. You know what I mean?

59
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.090
But have you seen some of Hunter Hunter's latest chapters?

60
00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:16.650
Have you seen some of the dark continent chapters? I've I've I've read,

61
00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.390
I've seen like some of the later chapters and some of them are just literally

62
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.230
there are pages that it's just all text. There's like one character.

63
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.320
I actually saw it on Twitter, right? Yeah. It's just a full page of text.

64
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.430
And at this point I'm just like too gushy. If you want to write a line novel,

65
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.600
just realize the lighten up.

66
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:37.201
<v 1>This man,</v>

67
00:03:37.201 --> 00:03:40.800
this manga is just somehow like writing a book without realizing that I don't

68
00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:41.634
know how.

69
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.750
<v 0>Kind of releasing volumes on the schedule of like light normal. Exactly.</v>

70
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.290
It's like, why are we pretending that this is a Monga anymore? You know?

71
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.350
<v 1>And like the drawings. Oh my God. Like, yeah.</v>

72
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.320
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, even art man. Just do it already. Like what's going on?</v>

73
00:03:57.321 --> 00:04:02.070
What I want to know is like, cause I don't think togarashi uses assistance.

74
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.810
<v 1>Uh, maybe, probably not.</v>

75
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.580
<v 0>If not, it's all assumptions. I think you'd think that again, resistance to dry,</v>

76
00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:12.450
right? His wife. Oh, well yeah. His wife is the author of sail ships.

77
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.410
Yeah, we did.

78
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.880
One of the greatest of all time I listened to them.

79
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.210
<v 1>Was Hunter. If you haven't read or seen it, just do it. It's amazing.</v>

80
00:04:24.211 --> 00:04:25.620
But Cooper had for just.

81
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.770
<v 0>Guess here's the thing. I haven't read.</v>

82
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.000
<v 1>Honda Honda at all, but I have all of the volumes up until this point.</v>

83
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.350
Honestly, watch the enemy. The enemy is so good. He's great. Yeah.

84
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.250
<v 0>It's, it's one of the few Animade that I think is better than the manga really?</v>

85
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.080
And that's because the 2011 version, the 2011 version,

86
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.810
because some of the later, uh, like arcs, especially the co com era and talk,

87
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.660
um, to gosh, his arc is really up and down because of his health complications.

88
00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:58.170
They was going through both like the animate is just consistent throughout.

89
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.230
<v 1>So then when he doesn't know, I would,</v>

90
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.680
I would recommend him because I'd recommend.

91
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.780
<v 0>So much about the series, like of like characters and like,</v>

92
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.600
I know so many, so many references,

93
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.440
but I've never actually sat down and riddle water. I think.

94
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.610
<v 1>I know enough about Naruto to like, to like lie,</v>

95
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.130
lie my way through a conversation and be like, Oh, you have to leave.

96
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.760
<v 0>I could probably live on way through a full metal Alchemist.</v>

97
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.520
I have done many times. Yeah. She's so sad. Let's be real. Like,

98
00:05:29.521 --> 00:05:30.950
I feel we've all done that. Right?

99
00:05:30.951 --> 00:05:33.930
I like everyone around you is talking about an enemy and you're kind of just

100
00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:35.940
like, ah, yeah. That thing.

101
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.780
<v 1>Yeah. I was an anime fan who had them watch even galleon people would be like,</v>

102
00:05:39.781 --> 00:05:41.880
dude, it's Epic. Right? I'm like, yeah. It'd be like getting the robot.

103
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.120
<v 0>No, my dad hates me.</v>

104
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.870
[inaudible] this is crazy.

105
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.770
I admittedly did that a little bit with, um, with, for.

106
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.170
<v 2>Insecure. Right? I did that for a while with bleach because I didn't,</v>

107
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.820
I dropped it at, uh, the Eisenach. So anything after that,

108
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.560
I had no idea, but people around me kept reading it and they were like, yeah,

109
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:15.530
you know, the whole like wicked Munos stuff. I was like, yeah.

110
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.800
Yeah. That totally.

111
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.650
<v 0>One of, one of those anime or manga that you could,</v>

112
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.700
you could feasibly lie your way out of it and make it seem like you've seen it

113
00:06:27.701 --> 00:06:31.690
without having seen it off after you've watched like a further first few walks,

114
00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:34.780
then you kinda just kinda just can just push it your way.

115
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.850
I too also want to see more bang.

116
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.290
<v 1>One piece. Right? Cause one piece is so long. It's like the Simpsons right.</v>

117
00:06:41.291 --> 00:06:43.720
Where everything that could ever happen has probably happened.

118
00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.010
So you could be like, dude,

119
00:06:45.011 --> 00:06:47.800
my favorite episode is where like Homer Simpson becomes a crack addict.

120
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:48.663
That's probably an episode.

121
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.910
<v 2>That's right. I mean, you could probably do that with one piece of right now.</v>

122
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.940
So you can just randomly be like, yeah,

123
00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.270
I love that episode with loofy and chopper make out.

124
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.250
<v 1>Yep. I love the part where the pirates find another band of pirates that are bad</v>

125
00:07:03.251 --> 00:07:06.340
initially and then turn and a part of some military. And then they're like,

126
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.340
do let's just be good. Let's help loofy out. Right.

127
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.550
<v 2>[Inaudible] that probably happened.</v>

128
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.300
That was vague enough that if I keep it vague,

129
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.600
that could be about four different arcs. I know enough.

130
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.240
<v 1>The base information about one piece. I still aren't ready yet. Again,</v>

131
00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:24.460
I downloaded some episodes, some chapters on my phone.

132
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.520
<v 0>So you're downloading a lot of chapters now. I see.</v>

133
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.140
<v 1>I have like 10 volumes downloaded, which is much how far into it.</v>

134
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.070
<v 0>I don't know because we're approaching what volume? A hundred of one piece.</v>

135
00:07:36.071 --> 00:07:38.800
So we're approaching chapter a thousand, I think all the way,

136
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:43.000
which is going to be a landmark and yeah,

137
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:44.950
a thousand chapters that's.

138
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.400
<v 2>Can you imagine two a thousand every week, a thousand.</v>

139
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.740
<v 0>Challenges cannot a thousand weeks.</v>

140
00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:55.660
<v 2>At least minimum because he married the author. I think so.</v>

141
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.640
I think it's kind of [inaudible] actually,

142
00:07:59.641 --> 00:08:01.780
because old age [inaudible].

143
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:06.850
<v 1>They're like you can't be married and make one piece like it's pick one.</v>

144
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.080
<v 2>Well, it's so interesting because like, I feel not like,</v>

145
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.880
because like not a whole lot about odor is even known because he's so

146
00:08:15.881 --> 00:08:20.290
rarely makes any like TV appearances or like interview appearances because it's

147
00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:22.750
too busy, writing a chapter a week. Right.

148
00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:23.981
<v 0>We'll just do that.</v>

149
00:08:23.981 --> 00:08:27.580
Cause odor out of every author is way more involved in the anime production as

150
00:08:27.581 --> 00:08:31.750
well. Because normally producer, normally a lot of Amie productions,

151
00:08:31.751 --> 00:08:33.970
people were just like, okay, there's the author.

152
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.880
And then the author just gets sidelined and they just continue doing that stuff.

153
00:08:36.881 --> 00:08:39.400
And maybe they'll watch the anime, you know? But you know,

154
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:43.600
OOD has been involved in a lot of the anime production, which I did.

155
00:08:43.601 --> 00:08:45.810
Where does he find the time to do this? I don't know.

156
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:48.790
<v 2>I like as a man is like a time management machine.</v>

157
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.120
<v 0>Shown in jump author. I don't know how you can have a life.</v>

158
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.940
Like most authors don't have a life outside their magazine. I mean,

159
00:08:56.941 --> 00:09:00.330
most of them have health complications because of how much they work.

160
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:01.251
<v 2>Not to mention that.</v>

161
00:09:01.251 --> 00:09:04.850
Like I swear with every new chapter odors art is just evolving.

162
00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.140
Like it's getting more,

163
00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.920
like some of the recent chapters are so detailed where it's like,

164
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.330
how do you draw this in a week? Yeah, exactly.

165
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.040
<v 0>Why people like to on one piece character designs because Oh,</v>

166
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.670
it looks cartoonish looks childish, weird. They do look weird.

167
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:23.270
<v 2>At least it's like so distinct to the point where you can look at a character</v>

168
00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:24.380
and be like, Oh yeah, that's one piece guy.

169
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.960
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. That's true. But you said about Simpsons,</v>

170
00:09:26.961 --> 00:09:29.420
but you don't have a family guy.

171
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.640
<v 2>And I would argue that that's better than a generic OSS looking character that</v>

172
00:09:34.641 --> 00:09:39.290
could fit into any [inaudible] or any one of.

173
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:39.740
<v 0>Oh,</v>

174
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:44.450
does character designs is way more memorable than here's generic ISA protagonist

175
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:48.800
number 75 that looks like Kirito just Ruskin's you know what I mean?

176
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:50.510
Like that's, that's what I think.

177
00:09:50.511 --> 00:09:53.720
I think that's my biggest problem with a lot of light novel adaptations is that

178
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.620
you can tell, lighten up adaptations nowadays by just by just the character,

179
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.600
how they look and just the art styles, right?

180
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.770
<v 2>Yeah. Because the character designs haven't changed from like 10 years ago.</v>

181
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.940
That's like good looking boy with average propulsions with a spiky hair,

182
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:10.220
color it in color. There you go.

183
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.740
<v 0>Even a lot of like the girls as well.</v>

184
00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:16.700
Cause I think when one is pink head character, like, like one of my favorites,

185
00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.910
one of my favorite female characters to come out of recent times is my soccer

186
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.640
Jima from Bonnie Gail senpai.

187
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.280
<v 2>And like, I really liked all.</v>

188
00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.730
<v 0>Of the cars there and all of the characters, but my God,</v>

189
00:10:28.731 --> 00:10:32.120
they have such forgettable character designs. You know what I mean?

190
00:10:32.121 --> 00:10:34.760
Compared to some of, some of the characters times from say,

191
00:10:34.761 --> 00:10:37.070
like mana Guthrie or something like that, which, you know,

192
00:10:37.071 --> 00:10:39.680
it gets compared to compared to lots of, and I see the same charm,

193
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:42.290
but in terms of the memorability of the character designs,

194
00:10:42.291 --> 00:10:46.160
it's just Bonnie Gil's senpai just looks like the most generic. Well, I mean,

195
00:10:46.161 --> 00:10:46.994
that's why that's.

196
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:48.920
<v 1>One of the reasons I just didn't watch it.</v>

197
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.230
<v 2>That's why they had to put her in a bunny costume. Right.</v>

198
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.660
<v 1>Differentiate between all the other characters.</v>

199
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.960
<v 0>I'm just, there's a lot of anime characters just like silhouette.</v>

200
00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.390
<v 1>Or eyes. Right. You can just know. Right.</v>

201
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.940
<v 2>And like, you know, I would argue again, like that's,</v>

202
00:11:01.941 --> 00:11:04.400
I think one of the strong suits about one piece, right? Is that like,

203
00:11:04.401 --> 00:11:07.190
because the character looks so wacky,

204
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.070
you can immediately tell that's a one-piece character. Yeah. Yeah.

205
00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.940
<v 0>And it's the way I describe odor is it it's some,</v>

206
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:18.200
it's like you're reading a story from someone who has the imagination of a

207
00:11:18.201 --> 00:11:19.034
ten-year-old,

208
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.280
but the writing skills of like George RR Martin or something like that,

209
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:23.291
you know what I mean? It's it's,

210
00:11:23.291 --> 00:11:28.250
it's so weird because you see a character like this cross-dressing ballerina,

211
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:32.600
for example. And you're like, what is this wacky Carter? Yeah. Yeah. Uh,

212
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.463
Mr. Too.

213
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:37.190
<v 1>Yeah. Mr. T I miss it too. Oh yeah.</v>

214
00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.290
<v 0>I always get the numbers mixed up clay summer.</v>

215
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.880
<v 1>Mr. Mr. Green eggs and ham.</v>

216
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:43.401
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

217
00:11:43.401 --> 00:11:45.890
You see his character designed for the first time and you're just like this.

218
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.050
I'm never going to give a about this character.

219
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.220
And then he ends up in later ox bringing you to tears sometimes. And just like,

220
00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.730
how did this happen? How, how does he make,

221
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:59.200
how did odor make me care about this person right now that you can see on

222
00:11:59.201 --> 00:11:59.890
screen?

223
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:02.890
Anyone who hasn't watched one piece is probably looking at this being like what

224
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:06.880
the cloud, who is this literal cloud. You know what I mean?

225
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.263
That's true.

226
00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:14.100
<v 1>Your weekly Jack off to, to one piece, a segment of the POG. Yeah.</v>

227
00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:15.960
<v 0>Yeah. As we're going to do every week now,</v>

228
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.470
are we going to do every week until you, until you start reading it,

229
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:22.830
I read it will become a one piece podcast.

230
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.260
No, it won't. But it might become more of a Mongo podcast.

231
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.930
<v 1>I mean, my, my I'll spend like 20 hours reading a Maga. My review will be like,</v>

232
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:34.960
yes. All right.

233
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.630
<v 0>So wait, so what would you give out of 10.</v>

234
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.780
<v 1>Claimable? I'm six, six, six. I see.</v>

235
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:44.880
I don't want to read anyone else's reviews of Mongo at all. I don't want to.

236
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:48.060
<v 0>No. Cause I feel like right now, because I don't head out because I don't.</v>

237
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.880
<v 1>Touch anything with reviews in terms of market.</v>

238
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.410
I don't know what the popular opinion is.

239
00:12:52.411 --> 00:12:54.240
I don't know if I should go to a thing you think it's good or bad?

240
00:12:54.241 --> 00:12:56.700
I just see something I'm like, I'll read that and make up my own choice.

241
00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.830
Kind of like it, that in my own bubble of like,

242
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.050
I don't give a what anyone else thinks.
