00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
<v 0>I'm going to say it, dude. When you, when you have fresh sheets,</v>

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.970
not only is that sleep the best. Yeah. That's it.

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.820
That's the best wind you'll have in like a month in fresh sheets. Dude.

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.470
<v 1>You gotta wait. You wait, wait, wait. You weren't like disgusting.</v>

5
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.650
What are you? Sorry, you can say, yeah, you're like winking onto your sheets.

6
00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.330
Like, are you like cheesy on site?

7
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.570
<v 0>On the napkin when you put them on so fresh,</v>

8
00:00:23.571 --> 00:00:25.910
the room smells nice and it feels comfortable. You're like, ah.

9
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.430
<v 1>That was the biggest they had us in the first half I've like ever had on this</v>

10
00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:35.060
podcast. Cause I was going to be like, yeah, I know exactly what you were

11
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.560
saying. You don't like that. Come on,

12
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.270
Jack off my bed as well. It's also great that,

13
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.290
you know what you said, if you want to say that the women were like, yes,

14
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.860
I agree. But same thing. Same thing.

15
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.750
<v 0>Climax in the bed. Fresh sheets. All same thing.</v>

16
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.480
<v 1>No, like I L I love fresh sheets. I hate the process of getting fresh sheets.</v>

17
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.710
Like, okay. Like putting on bed sheets, you've seen

18
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.920
quite well. What's your setup

19
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.580
kind of has like you look at Connor's like gaming setup. It's like perfect.

20
00:01:13.581 --> 00:01:17.630
Everything is like optimize. I didn't, then you see his bed. And it's like,

21
00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:18.051
one of those,

22
00:01:18.051 --> 00:01:21.710
like Reddit reacts to like some of the worst gaming setups I've ever seen.

23
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.950
It's it's, it's like, it's like a $2 bed set up.

24
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.250
Like you just have like a towel on your know.

25
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.330
<v 0>There's literally nothing in my bedroom except a bed. And there's like,</v>

26
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.360
literally nothing. Whereas like I was from a bedroom,

27
00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:36.620
I just sleep in there and do anything else.

28
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.850
And that seems like broken isn't it it's broken as well because I bought the

29
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:44.630
cheapest one, Amazon when I moved here, because know moving's expensive. Right.

30
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.260
And it was so expensive that I was like, I gotta go.

31
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.690
Cause I regret it because I bought a $200 bed.

32
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.550
And that was the mattress combined. And this awful. All the Springs of the beds.

33
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.760
<v 1>It's literally, as you're talking so much about like, yeah,</v>

34
00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:01.430
why would you buy a $20 headset when you can just buy a hundred dollar one?

35
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.293
You get your money.

36
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.590
<v 0>I had that philosophy. But again, moving kind of like distorts your,</v>

37
00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:10.070
your price range. Yeah. You're spending like, you know,

38
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.210
I got to put down like a full K deposit on this. And the flights are this much.

39
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.300
I'd pay shipping for my PC. Like I'm spending a lot of money. I'm like,

40
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.160
I'm kinda kind of losing a lot of money. I've got to start saving costs.

41
00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:25.310
I can't buy a 10 K bed frame. So I bought the cheapest one on Amazon,

42
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.550
which I regretted within about two weeks. Um, actually, no,

43
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:30.020
immediately when I built it, because building,

44
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:33.260
it was a pain in the because I could tell when I was building it, I'm like,

45
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.750
Oh no, this isn't even like budget plywood.

46
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:39.080
This is like the throw away plywood that they would use as like the foamy.

47
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.900
I don't remember seeing the exact bed frame.

48
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.110
He bought an Amazon and it was like two and a half stars.

49
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.610
And that's when I knew that.

50
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.250
<v 1>Mistakes for me, I.</v>

51
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.920
<v 0>Just wanted something and I wanted it now and I regretted it so much.</v>

52
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:52.520
But anyway,

53
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.550
what happened was the most ghetto thing that I have is that I'm actually using a

54
00:02:55.551 --> 00:03:00.160
bed sheet as like a mattress cover. So.

55
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.310
<v 1>What happened was right. How do you stretch that over it? Okay.</v>

56
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.320
Actually with a lot, like the power of Zeus, I'm like, I'm putting this,

57
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:08.940
I'm like.

58
00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.600
<v 0>The red sea back together. When I'm trying to put these bedsheets to zip.</v>

59
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.560
<v 1>Yeah. Just all around my mattress. Oh, you around your mattress.</v>

60
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.903
Your mattress.

61
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.930
<v 0>Like spot, I guess. Right when he's kicking the guy,</v>

62
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.130
I like doing that to my mattress.

63
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.180
<v 1>You have to do that every time you wash your mattress as well. So.</v>

64
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.880
<v 0>What's your bed sheet. I started washing my bed sheet as well.</v>

65
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.890
<v 1>Yeah. So I have to strip this thing out and then wash it back here.</v>

66
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.140
I feel so sorry for your bed, man.

67
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.760
<v 0>It's very stretched. So what happened? Okay.</v>

68
00:03:44.761 --> 00:03:47.310
But also I do avoid that annoying thing. This is a very, like,

69
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.950
this is like the only plus in this and I'm gonna go into the meeting negatives.

70
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.440
The only plus, right. Is that, you know,

71
00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:54.930
that annoying thing when you're sleeping in the bed sheet comes off in the

72
00:03:54.931 --> 00:03:58.290
corner. Yeah. You can never get it back on unless you actually get off the bed.

73
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.870
Yeah. I hate that. That sucks. I don't have that issue.

74
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.110
<v 1>[Inaudible] I can see like the benefits of it because like the,</v>

75
00:04:09.111 --> 00:04:11.910
the best bedsheets are the ones that are like.

76
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.640
If I see wrinkles on that, that's, that's such a, that's like instant, you know,

77
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.210
because sometimes you'll wake up and on your body. You'll like, have like,

78
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.690
I'm just like, what the is that?

79
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.830
<v 0>I do have a backup bedsheet, which actually that proper,</v>

80
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.980
but I refuse to use it unless I'm desperate because I love this one.

81
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.050
And I like even putting it back on while.

82
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.630
<v 1>Turning your mattress, it's all been bad. So here's how.</v>

83
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.780
<v 0>I ended up with a bed sheet as my duvet. And it goes all around my mattress.</v>

84
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.230
I fully put it all around my mattress and zip it off. Yeah.

85
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.310
So when I moved here, I went to NITECORE, which is kind of like Japanese, Ikea,

86
00:04:47.311 --> 00:04:50.280
which I think we mentioned before I go there. Right. So I buy,

87
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.260
I buy the pillows, the pillow sheets, you know, I buy the duvet and I,

88
00:04:54.261 --> 00:04:56.970
I go to the staff member and I ask him and like,

89
00:04:56.971 --> 00:04:59.790
I'm making sure I've got Google translate, man. I'm like Dubai. Or like,

90
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.500
whatever, that cold blanket, whatever I did not say like futon.

91
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.650
I mean, don't say futon. I'm like, I'm showing him, I'm like this.

92
00:05:07.651 --> 00:05:12.480
I even showed a picture. I'm like, Oh, this trough, which one is this?

93
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.190
Then like broken Japanese with Google.

94
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.440
<v 1>Translate was like, Oh no problem, fam.</v>

95
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.710
<v 0>I got, you pointed me to this. I buy it. I get home.</v>

96
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.690
<v 1>It's futon. And he saw me by the futon, another fruit on it.</v>

97
00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:26.040
Wasn't even in the same section as well.

98
00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:28.140
So that's where I was confused when I got home. So I'm like, wait,

99
00:05:28.141 --> 00:05:31.170
this isn't a different section. Why do we have two different futon types?

100
00:05:31.171 --> 00:05:32.580
What is this? So.

101
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.930
<v 0>Two futon covers. So I have the bedsheet and then I have the mattress.</v>

102
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.920
So I got home and I needed to sleep. So I'm like, well, it.

103
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.790
It's going in one way or another, like, it's going over my bed. I haven't gone.

104
00:05:44.791 --> 00:05:46.350
Helped me the first time getting up. Yeah.

105
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.270
<v 1>This is a [inaudible] you get that on yourself. So</v>

106
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.843
I thought,

107
00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.640
I just assumed that you got to do me now. I've I've.

108
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.260
<v 0>Mastered the technique to Hazel. I do get it off. It's easy.</v>

109
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.900
Cause like, it's like, it's like your body wants to get off.

110
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.220
It's like letting a pig out of clothes. That wants to come up, get it back on.

111
00:06:10.221 --> 00:06:12.410
Right. Okay. First of all, this, this is the setup.

112
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.260
I flipped my mattress to the side. So it's upright.

113
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.030
And I like pull over half my flip it upside down the other end, pull it up.

114
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.330
And then this basically what happens is, is that it's up to here, right?

115
00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:25.790
So this is long horizontal. That's right. I've got a,

116
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:30.740
basically forced the together. Like grab it together and hold it.

117
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.480
And it hurts my hands. Cause tight.

118
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.360
I got to like slowly pull a little bit by little bit. And if I let go,

119
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:38.660
it all goes back. So I have to keep grabbing a little bit and zipping,

120
00:06:38.661 --> 00:06:40.790
grabbing a little bit and zipping. It's a pain in the.

121
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.370
<v 1>Why don't you just get a duty on the world's largest clone on a dude,</v>

122
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.860
just get a proper bed.

123
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.630
<v 0>You know what? I love the firmness of it. Like I love how tight it is around me.</v>

124
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.380
<v 1>Let's get a bed sheet and just, you might as well, not even have a bed sheet.</v>

125
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.963
Why, why?

126
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.870
Like there's a difference between having no bed sheet and having a phone.

127
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.940
I sweat like a. I need a bed sheet. Right? It's like a thousand yen. I dunno.

128
00:07:06.941 --> 00:07:09.880
I've kind of gotten like you straight kinda like

129
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.310
literally made a spreadsheet, trying to optimize cooking.

130
00:07:15.311 --> 00:07:17.230
And he can't even buy a bed sheet.

131
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.480
<v 0>Because then I got to optimize that. It's another thing to optimize.</v>

132
00:07:22.481 --> 00:07:24.460
I'm sick of it, man. Well, too fast that,

133
00:07:24.461 --> 00:07:27.250
that whole optimization with the Uber eats was just to justify to myself why I

134
00:07:27.251 --> 00:07:29.050
can have like pad Thai three times a week.

135
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.460
<v 1>So like, I like,</v>

136
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.310
I like the final result of cooking and clean bedsheets, but like, Oh,

137
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.120
I like having to change your Duval. Like did you find it a nice,

138
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.320
like fiddly as thing ever to like take the duvet off and like putting it back on

139
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.610
and having to make sure every, every corner is perfectly situated for you.

140
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.710
If you have a zipped up wall, not, not, not the bed sheet,

141
00:07:53.711 --> 00:07:54.850
the actual blanket. Yeah.

142
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.060
<v 0>Oh, that's easy. Cause the, the ones that Japan, big brain,</v>

143
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.360
they come with the holes at the end. So you can just flip it up inside, out,

144
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.130
grab the thing and then yeah. That's what I want.

145
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.880
<v 1>Well, you could do that. Yeah. That's what I've done it ever since I started.</v>

146
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.390
<v 0>You turn it inside out. Yeah, I do that. And then you look like a little ghost.</v>

147
00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.380
You put it over you. Yeah, I do that at the ends of the, the futon.

148
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.480
And then you just like flip it over and then it.

149
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.180
<v 1>Yeah. And then shake it down. But like, for me, like,</v>

150
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:24.100
I don't know if hotels do speed running a hundred rooms. Like,

151
00:08:24.101 --> 00:08:25.210
I don't know if my like,

152
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:30.220
cause I think I have like my nightmare where my duvet is not the

153
00:08:30.221 --> 00:08:32.710
same size as my blanket. It's slightly bigger.

154
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:37.900
So I always have like left a little bit of fabric on it triggers me so much,

155
00:08:37.901 --> 00:08:42.280
man. I hate the ones. I hate the ones like our old dovey.

156
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.880
Well, it was like the perfect size. But the problem was is that it would,

157
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.250
the duvet inside would move around.

158
00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:53.260
So like one end of the duvet would just have like just scrunched up.

159
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.040
So let's just try and pull it over. It's just, and I'm just like,

160
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.870
with what's the dude. They go.

161
00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.610
That's why I think you are most likely to have a mental breakdown when you're

162
00:09:01.611 --> 00:09:05.430
doing your bed sheets. So putting out Dubai office, I that's,

163
00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:10.130
that's why I hate it, man. I hate it. I don't know what it is about Sheetz on,

164
00:09:10.131 --> 00:09:12.320
but what? It just doesn't work. You're like, it. I just want to cry.

165
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.220
Why won't it work? Why won't it work this my day,

166
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.790
going to work in like a hotel,

167
00:09:19.791 --> 00:09:24.020
like lodges and like ski fields and stuff. And I had to do that every day.

168
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:25.123
So yeah.

169
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.520
So basically like shovel out of the drains and then you gotta go do that. Yeah.

170
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:33.410
So I had to, I, that sounds like my nightmare at first I hated it. I was like,

171
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:38.270
Oh, there's this 30 rooms in this hotel that doesn't seem too bad.

172
00:09:38.271 --> 00:09:40.760
Five rooms. And you're like, man. I want to go home. Like,

173
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.550
like just around with the dude. Just like

174
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.740
[inaudible] I actually have a mental breakdown.

175
00:09:48.741 --> 00:09:51.830
If I just do like five sheets in like one hour, I would actually be like, no,

176
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.350
no, I don't think life is. Yeah. I'm like, I'm not getting paid enough.

177
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:55.180
I brought it.

178
00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.810
I would actually [inaudible]. I'd rather shovel and like get shouted out. And

179
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:56.810
don't five do in the row, man. So now I'm just used to it because

180
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:56.810
 I've lived through that Vietnam war.
