00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.040
<v 0>Actually, I remember I was a little stream yesterday.</v>

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.580
I had a person coming and being like, why do you guys hate America?

3
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.450
<v 1>We don't hit American heritage. How absurd America.</v>

4
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.190
<v 0>Talk about Americans is like the way I liked, like to on my cousins.</v>

5
00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:14.520
You know what I mean? It's it's,

6
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.300
it's like the distant cousin that I just like to talk about.

7
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.850
We don't hate on America. We just like making fun of America.

8
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.013
There's a big difference.

9
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.700
<v 1>You know, Europe's boring. There's nothing weird about it. America is weird.</v>

10
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.840
<v 0>Yeah, no, I, it comes from a place of love. You know what I mean? This,</v>

11
00:00:29.841 --> 00:00:34.220
this is how us Brits show like, well, you know, we, we talked to our like mates.

12
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.080
Yeah. That's how I see it.

13
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.740
<v 1>Like in it, all your teeth are. What? Go and drink some tea. Like, wait,</v>

14
00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:40.580
why are you making fun of America?

15
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.320
<v 0>Canton, you call consummate. That's how it works.</v>

16
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.230
<v 1>True. True. Would you ever live in America?</v>

17
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.390
I'm going to ask this before on the podcast.

18
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:51.890
I think you've asked me on the podcast.

19
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.650
I think I've asked you post problem what your answer was.

20
00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:55.130
That's why I'm asking you.

21
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.810
<v 0>I mean like I've given it.</v>

22
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.900
<v 1>Well, you can see what your dating. Oh yeah. You can do both. Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.180
<v 0>We hate Americans. We hate America.</v>

24
00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:07.760
We hate Americans so much so that our significant others.

25
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.583
<v 1>Are Americans.</v>

26
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.280
The way Sydney talks to me about food sometimes with like a nostalgia.

27
00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:15.410
I'm like disgusting. Gosh.

28
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.700
<v 0>Sit at living in America for maybe like a year just to like give it a go.</v>

29
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.680
<v 1>Silent. I would go there to visit, you know, like I don't.</v>

30
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.090
<v 0>Visiting. Like I love visiting America, but I don't, I don't like, I don't know.</v>

31
00:01:29.091 --> 00:01:31.310
Just difference in personality, at least with me.

32
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.070
And like way of living is like, it's very different to what I'm used to.

33
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.600
<v 1>Open everyone is [inaudible] open everyone. Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.230
<v 0>I feel like the biggest thing I would have to get to is like,</v>

35
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.720
I like feeling safe. Yeah.

36
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.480
The only thing stopping me from living in America is the fact that even during

37
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:54.320
the day, I don't feel safe. Yeah. Like it's, it's so weird for me.

38
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.440
Whether the way you can be in some of the most famous places in the world in

39
00:01:57.441 --> 00:02:01.400
America, and you just can't walk anywhere. I like, I like walking to places,

40
00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:02.234
you know what I mean?

41
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.370
I feel like I have to recalibrate my brain in order to go, like in,

42
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.250
in order to travel to places in America.

43
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.910
Because I forget that you have to just drive everywhere and just walking.

44
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.270
Isn't normalized because you could, you know, it's, it's just not safe.

45
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.720
Even when you're in like the middle of LA, right? Like, you'd be like, Oh,

46
00:02:20.721 --> 00:02:23.630
you know, I'll just like go to the Starbucks. That's just around the corner.

47
00:02:23.631 --> 00:02:26.150
You know? It's like just going to the next town in an RPG.

48
00:02:26.151 --> 00:02:27.620
And yet on the street corner,

49
00:02:27.621 --> 00:02:31.040
there's a level 100 crackers standing there being like, looking at a composite.

50
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.050
<v 1>When I was in San Francisco, man,</v>

51
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:35.830
I felt like I was walking back to my hotel at 2:00 AM.

52
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.310
Felt like a cyberpunk mission, dude.

53
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.700
<v 0>The music was playing in my ears like that. You said you walked back at 2:00 AM,</v>

54
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.260
like already scares me. Yeah.

55
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.710
<v 1>Okay. I legit have never been scheduled walking somewhere.</v>

56
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.700
I was in right in the middle of like the financial district in San Francisco.

57
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.100
I was like. I think I've mentioned it before on a podcast as well. But yeah,

58
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.010
that was scary. I'm scared. I'm scared thinking about it.

59
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.220
That's the only thing that's stopping.

60
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.180
<v 0>Me from living in America.</v>

61
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.030
<v 1>Everyone I know from San Francisco has had the car broken into.</v>

62
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.200
<v 0>I've heard so many weird stories about like some of the stories that Malin says,</v>

63
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.550
cause Malin is on Sanford is from San Fran where it's one of it's like it, it,

64
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.870
so counter-intuitive for me where this is the place where it's got like one of

65
00:03:18.871 --> 00:03:20.490
like the highest cost of living.

66
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.670
<v 1>Like a million dollars a year, like a millionaire.</v>

67
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.090
<v 0>Is considered like poor there. You know what I mean? That's, that's kind of,</v>

68
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.560
that's kind of the place we're talking about yet.

69
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.400
It's a place where the cost of living is so high yet.

70
00:03:32.401 --> 00:03:36.990
It seems like you still need to worry about some of the stuff where I feel like

71
00:03:36.991 --> 00:03:40.170
if I'm earning a million dollars, I wouldn't need to worry about it. Like if I,

72
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.490
why would I need to worry?

73
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.700
Like why would I need to pay this much and worry about living in a neighborhood

74
00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:46.140
where my car could get broken into? Yeah.

75
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.160
It feels like everyone who I've met from San Fran has had something stolen.

76
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.660
They talk about things. They talk about that as if they got like a parking like,

77
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.330
Oh, got it again. Oh, well,

78
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.660
when Malin was talking about how she has to have like one headphone in,

79
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.440
just in case there's someone behind her to like take her purse or something.

80
00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:07.860
I'm like, what the, what the? Like, why would you,

81
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.070
how do you feel safe living in the city like that? Or a country like that?

82
00:04:11.071 --> 00:04:11.880
For that matter.

83
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.750
<v 1>I convinced the cyber truck's being made as purely second with Stan criminals in</v>

84
00:04:15.751 --> 00:04:17.070
San Francisco are breaking in.

85
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.030
Everyone's going to be in like like Ahmed trucks in San Francisco,

86
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.790
but they'll still find a way to break into it. Yeah.

87
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.970
<v 0>Right. But that's the thing. The only places I feel safe in America,</v>

88
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.100
I like the super tourist heavy places. Right? Yeah.

89
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.450
So like the peers in San Francisco or like, you know, Vegas strip, right.

90
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.831
<v 1>UK, somewhere in the middle.</v>

91
00:04:34.831 --> 00:04:38.250
I think like you can't really like leave your laptop on the dashboard. Really?

92
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.090
No.

93
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.760
<v 0>I would argue though, this is like, other than Japan is not a lot of countries.</v>

94
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.530
<v 1>No, but like in the UK I'd I'd leave like my, my headphones on the chair.</v>

95
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.200
I don't really mind risking that. I'm like, whatever. No,

96
00:04:49.201 --> 00:04:54.120
I wouldn't even do that. Depends. Are you all in London? No. Other like Wales.

97
00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:56.400
Yeah. It's whatever. Well, yeah, because that's countryside, right?

98
00:04:56.401 --> 00:04:58.470
What are they going to do? Run away with the sheep.

99
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.220
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

100
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.890
<v 1>Yeah. I don't know. I mean it's yeah. I don't know. It's weird.</v>

101
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:05.820
I really want to,

102
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.580
I've always said this I've always wanted to live in America for a year.

103
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.790
<v 0>I would like to live in America for like trying it out. Yeah.</v>

104
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.310
<v 1>I think if I moved from Japan, I think I would like to try and get.</v>

105
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.930
<v 0>I'm I'm I'm still like,</v>

106
00:05:15.931 --> 00:05:19.110
because me and Cindy want to move to America for a bit because like her family's

107
00:05:19.111 --> 00:05:21.330
there and you know, she wants to be close to her family for a while.

108
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.710
It's just finding the perfect place that I would actually want to live in.

109
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.491
Cause I don't,

110
00:05:26.491 --> 00:05:30.150
I don't know where I could see myself settling down in America makers like,

111
00:05:30.151 --> 00:05:34.170
you know, for YouTube is it's like the number one spot is always LA, but.

112
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.490
Living in LA. Sorry for from LA. No,

113
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.490
it's not about it's about LA. YouTube is man it's Oh yeah.

114
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.080
She was a different beast, man. They, they are a different breed.

115
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.791
<v 1>Like every,</v>

116
00:05:47.791 --> 00:05:51.000
every like there's I feel like there was literally just two scenes on YouTube,

117
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.410
YouTube and Lau chili. Like it's totally different. Like I, I like,

118
00:05:55.411 --> 00:05:59.030
and you know, when someone's living in LA, I swear. Cause when you talk to them,

119
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:00.290
you're like, bro, you're just like,

120
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:03.560
in another reality you play by different rules. I'm brainwashed.

121
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.510
<v 0>But I get it. Cause like when you're there, like.</v>

122
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.170
<v 1>You feel it,</v>

123
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.750
you feel like you're in a different place when you're in LA and you feel like

124
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:10.970
everything you do somehow has a bigger weight to it.

125
00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:12.440
I think that's what they think.

126
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.950
<v 0>It's like brand Mike.</v>

127
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.130
We were talking about cloud chasing before LA Croix.

128
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.840
<v 1>The center of clout chasing. I feel like everyone's out to get some clout. Yeah.</v>

129
00:06:22.841 --> 00:06:26.050
I feel dirty when I'm there. I'm talking to people. I'm just like, dude,

130
00:06:26.051 --> 00:06:28.630
I'm just, I'm just like, I'm just like trying to get just a style box for her.

131
00:06:28.631 --> 00:06:31.420
Like why, why are we talking about how many subs you have? Like, I don't care.

132
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.600
I really like that donkey video where he like.

133
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.440
<v 0>Did a commentary over the hundred hundred feeds one.</v>

134
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:42.340
I learned just like all the house thieves.

135
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.470
<v 1>New sports organization made by nade shot. He used to be a YouTuber. Yeah.</v>

136
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.170
But yeah, he, he started one, right? So he has his own little,

137
00:06:50.171 --> 00:06:51.100
you want to go tell the rest of it?

138
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.300
<v 0>Yeah. So he, he basically commentates over like this house tour.</v>

139
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.620
And it's it? It is like when, when, when you would,

140
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.250
the way donkey commentates, it, it, it,

141
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:05.650
it is basically like you're going into a different world because what was like

142
00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:10.270
the room, like the Tortino's training room or something.

143
00:07:10.271 --> 00:07:11.800
I'm just like, it sounds like, uh,

144
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.710
like you say it out of context and this sounds like a dystopia.

145
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.520
<v 1>I have a sponsor in the building. So when you mentioned I'm in this room,</v>

146
00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:21.670
you have to say like I'm in the monster energy gaming room.

147
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.580
I won that for trash tastes.

148
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.950
<v 0>This is Al Del taco's toilet. I'm in the</v>

149
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.770
[inaudible] sponsor Ralphie room. Yes. Yes.
