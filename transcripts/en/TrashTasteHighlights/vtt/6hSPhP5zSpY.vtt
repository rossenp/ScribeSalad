1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
<v 0>So was it anime that I I'm guessing it was animated? The reason you just,</v>

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.790
you started to learn animation and really.

3
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.500
<v 1>No, I, so I w I wanted to be manga, but I was, uh, uh,</v>

4
00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:13.334
good at school.

5
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.380
<v 2>Not good as cool. And I'm, well, I, you have a.</v>

6
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.480
<v 1>Lessons, but I didn't listen to listen. I was drawing manga to my notes.</v>

7
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.700
And so I went to another school, uh,

8
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.451
not a high school,

9
00:00:29.451 --> 00:00:33.410
a high school where you could learn about communication or craft.

10
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.790
<v 2>Uh, in France or in France.</v>

11
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.880
<v 1>I was born and raised in France. And at first it was about communication,</v>

12
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.910
uh, how to do cm, uh, commercial.

13
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.430
And it was not pleasant,

14
00:00:46.431 --> 00:00:51.020
but I had to go this way to go to

15
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.450
admission schools. Right. So I take the [inaudible] in French. Let me say, so,

16
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.840
uh.

17
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.580
<v 0>First degree. Oh, bachelor.</v>

18
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.600
So you did a bachelor's degree in animation and yeah.

19
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.690
<v 1>And after I can went to, uh, animation schools. Oh, wow.</v>

20
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.280
<v 0>Okay. So how did it transition from then that in France to being in Japan?</v>

21
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.810
Cause I feel like that's like a, that's a big leap, right?

22
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.130
<v 1>Tell us about when the UN at the artisans core in France,</v>

23
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.530
uh, in France and you mean, wasn't sorry, it's what's popular,

24
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.010
but for adults, it's what kind of,

25
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.600
what kind of child mom says this and, Oh, you should change some Stites.

26
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.860
It's not a good style.

27
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.680
<v 2>You have others who.</v>

28
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.300
<v 1>Are watching you from earth and change.</v>

29
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.530
[inaudible] yeah. It's not a bad idea, but smell. Yeah. And so,

30
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.870
yeah, I was okay. I don't, I have, if I draw mandates bad things,

31
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.460
so I changed my style, but, uh, when I, uh,

32
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.740
actually I wanted to draw them, I guess Tyler.

33
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.660
<v 0>Yeah. I feel like in Europe,</v>

34
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.670
there is the notion of animation is especially animate looks for children. Yeah.

35
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:08.090
Yeah.

36
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.060
Because I feel like everyone I spoke to grew up in Europe seems that way where

37
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:14.840
it's like, Oh, after I'm 16, I can't watch this child stuff. Right.

38
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.920
Every art student, I know, like I have a cousin who's like,

39
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.470
who's an art student. Hadn't like, she loves anime.

40
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.470
But as soon as she started art school, you, you were just like,

41
00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:28.220
it was looked down upon to really draw an anime art style.

42
00:02:28.221 --> 00:02:30.440
So I don't know if it's still the same, getting bullied everywhere.

43
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.320
<v 2>Exactly. Right. Cause like you.</v>

44
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.020
<v 0>You draw anime and your art teacher would just be like, no, no, no.</v>

45
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.880
Please draw real art please.

46
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.590
<v 1>Uh, professor of arts quarter. Oh, you're drawing manga. Okay. Uh,</v>

47
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.370
I will give you a bad note. [inaudible].

48
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.870
<v 2>You have.</v>

49
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.600
<v 1>Draw some, uh, uh, American. Comey's good.</v>

50
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.740
<v 2>Yes.</v>

51
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.090
<v 1>They're not equal to, by some professor. Uh, so teacher,</v>

52
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.340
so yeah, it was kind of harder the first time,

53
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.480
because you are a bit lost. Okay. I have to change my style.

54
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.550
But uh,

55
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.890
when you met other people who like what to like to you have a

56
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.420
better communication. Right. And you know, I want to do this.

57
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:21.280
I want to draw and miss time.

58
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.800
<v 3>I want to be a weep. I want to follow my dreams.</v>

59
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.490
<v 1>And uh, so yeah. Yeah. And I found that, so you,</v>

60
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.300
you Theresa animation school in France. And so I attempt to,

61
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.610
I went to animation school.

62
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.680
Bet you Rulon Disney way in ride. Right, right.

63
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.910
Japanese way, because Japanese way is very popular. Or you,

64
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.070
you use economy,

65
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.750
economy of the frame or that very smart.

66
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.160
It's a smart way to use a Japanese animation in Disney.

67
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.050
You have a lot of budget. So you can put a lot of frames.

68
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.463
You get the problem.

69
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.620
<v 0>Disney has just more drawings where the Japanese animation technique is more,</v>

70
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.600
let's say optimized texts.

71
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.400
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

72
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.660
<v 1>The Japanese animation industry. You have to do one episode per week.</v>

73
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.900
So I am maybe in Democrats,

74
00:04:21.901 --> 00:04:25.470
I finished and they delivered the episode to the channel.

75
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.060
But in Japan when you broadcast the show, it's not finished. Yeah.

76
00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:31.350
Yeah. Trying to.

77
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.540
<v 0>Notice that a lot of Blu-ray releases have like retouches, like Jo, Jo,</v>

78
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.260
there's some famous examples right. Of the side-by-side where you can, like,

79
00:04:40.261 --> 00:04:43.770
there's a website, I think where you can sweep the frame or LA cross.

80
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.100
And like some of the character designs are totally changed in the Blu-ray.

81
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.310
<v 1>That's called a DVD retakes. And uh,</v>

82
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.490
actually when you saw your shoulder show on TV,

83
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.900
and so for people who want to buy the DVD,

84
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.090
that is a plus and the plus a bonus is a better drawings, animation,

85
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.750
redone.

86
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.180
<v 0>Polished. So is it, is it,</v>

87
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.660
is it like the original drawing is thrown out and they just remake it or do they

88
00:05:09.661 --> 00:05:13.980
improve the original drawing improve or sometimes they redo it. Oh, wow. Wow.

89
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:15.413
That's quite intense.

90
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.880
<v 1>For us. This gets, we cannot do a hundred percent what we wanted. Right. Uh,</v>

91
00:05:20.881 --> 00:05:24.780
so let's redo it. Ah, Oh, this one,

92
00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:29.500
I just mess up on the ice or let's redraw the ice. Right.

93
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.093
Okay. Wow.

94
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.380
<v 4>Yeah. I did find that funny actually, because like, yeah, I noticed that like,</v>

95
00:05:34.381 --> 00:05:38.250
cause you know, I, I did, uh, when I did voice work for pop team Epic,

96
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.410
I did it on episode nine and when I got the script for it, episode,

97
00:05:43.411 --> 00:05:47.790
one had already had, so I was like, is this going to be out in time?

98
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.200
<v 3>Cause I always thought, because.</v>

99
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.480
<v 4>It worked like how in American TV shows where it's like the entire season is</v>

100
00:05:54.481 --> 00:05:58.730
Oregon's Don Dawn and then they releasing it. But in Japan they're just like,

101
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.520
Nope, we got to do it now. Like it's all real time. Right? Yeah.

102
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.560
<v 1>Yeah. It depends when the first, uh, the first hippies that is broadcast,</v>

103
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.450
uh, actuary. So there's Ted, you have,

104
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.670
might have done already 10 episodes. Maybe if the schedule was good.

105
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.450
Well, if they have done just a five period, it would be harder.

106
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.980
<v 4>Yeah. 10 episodes is considered a good scale. Yeah, exactly.</v>
