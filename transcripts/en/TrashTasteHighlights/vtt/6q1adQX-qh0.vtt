00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.130
<v 0>Um, the next list we're going to be discussing</v>

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:05.560
[inaudible]. Wow. I guess we're just going in the water now. All right. Okay. 

3
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:05.560
Who, I can't remember when I've last updated this. Cause I stopped updating my 

4
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:05.560
mouse and I moved over to, you can see what the most recent and I moved over to 

5
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:05.560
kids, Sue. So it depends if kids who is also updating this, but, um,

6
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:05.560
 this is going to be my teenage, uh,  tastes I'm guessing. So

7
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:05.560
 I can, I can tell this is your teenage days because like, I don't know

8
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:05.560
. In a past episode you talked so much about a Kira

9
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.393
 and you've given it an eight out of 10.

10
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.030
What would you give it now? I'll give you like a six, a six

11
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.470
gave I can make a kill. You curious,

12
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.390
is it, is it really low? I'm just curious. Yeah. What is it?

13
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:55.460
What'd you get three years. What would you rate it today?

14
00:00:55.461 --> 00:01:00.290
If I asked you to rate, I can make a kill, like to two to that bad.

15
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.010
Yeah. I would also give it. It's pretty bad. It's pretty. Okay.

16
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.180
You gave it a four. You gave it a four. Okay. Okay, good, good. Yeah.

17
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.430
Teenage me. I tastes okay. I can't make a kill.

18
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.400
Was one of those shows where I thought it was awful.

19
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.240
And then all the comments were the mangas better. The mangas better.

20
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.800
Trust me guys. The Mongols better.

21
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.460
So it was one of those few times why called them on their bluff? Right?

22
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.690
I called the Monga. Rita's on their bluff and I read the marker up to the end.

23
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.700
And I'm just like, this is just the same. Just elongates. I mean,

24
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.970
everyone was complaining about the animated only ending of a comment. Go kill.

25
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.680
But the Monga is like equally as edgy, but it just, it just elongates.

26
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.840
It just has a different ending and it's, it's,

27
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.250
it's equally as bad in my Al the nurse. A zero.

28
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.140
You gave it a six season. What? A six and, and season two or six season two.

29
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.910
Come on. It's infinitely worse than season one. Season one,

30
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.150
zero season one is actually like pretty decent, I think. Yeah.

31
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.140
You still good of stuff about album nosy I'll know, zero season one.

32
00:02:03.141 --> 00:02:06.260
I don't remember why she maybe finished both of them at the same time.

33
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.160
Like you may be off with the shaver because,

34
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.840
because I remember I would know season one being pretty interesting and then it

35
00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:16.820
was like, it was, it was great.

36
00:02:16.821 --> 00:02:21.230
And then the cliff hanger season ending happened and it was just like, Holy.

37
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.110
This is super interesting. And then season two,

38
00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:27.740
just kind of on everything that season one session became like Kira tones and

39
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.680
stuff in the garden. Yeah, I know. I know.

40
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.790
I know this is like teenage God's list because you came buckets Testo and eight

41
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.710
dude. Okay. Okay. I still stand by that. Yeah, it is.

42
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.960
It is when you also gave season two and eight as well.

43
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.710
It does not as good as season one. I've never watched back.

44
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.750
What's back test about it's just like a, it's like a comedy,

45
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.500
like kind of trashy, like romance itch,

46
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.470
to be honest. I like it.

47
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.370
I thought it was pretty good Schuman ambassador for domestic girlfriend.

48
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.330
That's right up his phone.

49
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.310
It was like one of the first comedy anime that actually made me laugh.

50
00:03:05.311 --> 00:03:07.530
And I didn't think was generic. And now

51
00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.630
I look back, I think, yeah, it was probably pretty generic. I don't know.

52
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.700
Like I look at the art style and I'm just like,

53
00:03:14.701 --> 00:03:18.540
this is premium mid two thousands. Animate is nothing interesting.

54
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.090
Uh, back in. Oh, a 10 as well. Yeah. Yup. Yup. I think we all get back

55
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.510
on my list. I don't know what that's why,

56
00:03:27.511 --> 00:03:30.120
that's why I'm curious to see what your three by threes are because that's,

57
00:03:30.121 --> 00:03:34.230
that's where that's where like the real personality test comes in. Hold on.

58
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.920
I gotta ask that. Marlene, do we have beers? Oh no, no.

59
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.330
That'd be gave me some beers. Okay, good. I'm just checking to make sure. Okay.

60
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.480
Because it'd be fine. Oh yeah. We got the

61
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.570
[inaudible] you like that going? We're going to be smashing some of this,

62
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.940
like the beers. No don't ever give. He doesn't even deserve to have a beer.

63
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.290
You don't want some, a pecker is going to take her on juice too.

64
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.460
So I noticed as well that you also gave a bit tomb and eight. Yeah,

65
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.870
yeah, yeah. I actually would side more with gone on this one,

66
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.020
even though it did end kind of. Yeah. It wasn't the ending absolute,

67
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.450
but the show was really fun and the show was opening 10 out of 10

68
00:04:21.451 --> 00:04:25.830
dude, 10 out of 10 opening. But soon the show VAT was just pure fun.

69
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.790
I dunno. Like it is good. It was, he was great.

70
00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:34.230
It was one of the few death games that didn't feel like it was one, a,

71
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.210
a battle Royale rip-off because the problem with every death game anime is

72
00:04:39.211 --> 00:04:42.510
that I feel, it feels like a, like a Virgin battle Royale. You know what I mean?

73
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.700
That's all y'all do there. I'm like, why would you,

74
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.870
why would I want to watch anything else? But it was just like,

75
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.750
it didn't try to pretend I wasn't a battle Royale rip off, but it just like,

76
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.900
it went off that, and it just was a hell of a lot of fun.

77
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.650
Now I think I gave it a lower score. I think when I first finished it,

78
00:04:58.651 --> 00:05:00.510
I also gave him maybe like a seven or an eight,

79
00:05:00.511 --> 00:05:03.210
but then I read the Munger and I was like, Oh yeah, give it to that.

80
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.130
Wasn't that great. I guess for some reason, like,

81
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.680
batoon has always been one of those shoes, like stuck with me. I don't know why.

82
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.480
Like I've always just wanted the season. I mean, I still,

83
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.730
I still think about it. Think about why it didn't have a season two.

84
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.610
Like I know Sydney read the manga.

85
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.030
She said the Mongo is also pretty good after the Monga among is way better.

86
00:05:21.031 --> 00:05:24.900
I was actually good. Yeah. Okay. You gave her among us instead of 10.

87
00:05:24.901 --> 00:05:28.770
So you did, to me, you all my brother,

88
00:05:28.771 --> 00:05:31.410
because you gave gunk over tan, which I also agree with.
