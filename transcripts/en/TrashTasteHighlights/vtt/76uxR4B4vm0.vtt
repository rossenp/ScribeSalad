1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.950
<v 0>No. I was playing Mario kart with someone and they couldn't drift on Mario kart.</v>

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.860
And I thought, this is a very basic mechanic. This is not that hard time.

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.070
And I was like, you should just try it. Like without the baby modem, like,

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.600
as I feel like the baby mode, just all you're then doing is holding a right,

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.750
like without bees, because the fun part about Mario kart right. Is drifting.

6
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:22.170
Right. And nailing drifts, you know, and you know, playing the game.

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.710
I like drifting and Mario kart. Okay. I'm going to say that like 90th time. Um,

8
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.843
so.

9
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.840
<v 1>I love drifting. And you said that as if it's an unpopular opinion.</v>

10
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.850
<v 0>I was playing with someone the other day. Right. And I was like, I was like,</v>

11
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.630
they couldn't be.

12
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.463
<v 1>I'm glad you</v>

13
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.020
[inaudible].

14
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.010
<v 0>Ladies that's so they couldn't beat me in Mario kart. Right. And I'm like, yeah.</v>

15
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.300
It's because you're not drifting.

16
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.820
You're never going to beat me if you're not drifting. And they were like, Oh,

17
00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:52.910
okay. I guess I'll try. And they tried it once. Right. They try to,

18
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.010
they try without Bape murder and they kept falling off the edge.

19
00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:57.410
And they were like, no, I don't like Myra now it's not fun. I'm like,

20
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.860
what did you expect? You were just going to be amazing right away. No,

21
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.100
you got to put some effort in, start living out a drift. You dumb. Try it.

22
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.010
<v 1>[Inaudible] fact that you've gotten that competitive over the barrier car just</v>

23
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:12.950
shows how much like your mentor just shows all your mentality.

24
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.130
<v 0>Drives me insane when people try something like that. Right.</v>

25
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.800
That is not that mad. Okay. We're not talking about, I'm not like,

26
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.560
just get good at StarCraft, bro. I'm not asking that I'm like,

27
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.080
press one button on Mario kart. When you come to the corner,

28
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.400
that's all I'm asking. Right.

29
00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:28.400
That's what I'm trying to explain to people who like throw a fit and like,

30
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.600
I don't wanna play it anymore. It's not fun.

31
00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:32.120
Now I failed this one mechanic and I don't care to learn it.

32
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.740
Like that drives me insane.

33
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.730
<v 1>I can imagine the dad, you're going to be like, son,</v>

34
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.070
you can't drift America. You're you're disappointed. [inaudible].

35
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.130
<v 0>I do not have like, people will be like, wow, Kaunas that guy with? Like,</v>

36
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.770
cause to me fighting game combos are absurd.

37
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.710
Like the amount of combos and inputs you have to put in, it's just too much.

38
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.630
Like there was just such a steep learning curve. Right.

39
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.680
There'll be a fighting game if you'd be up in arms and be like, okay,

40
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.380
I like that. That's the drifting.

41
00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:04.430
And Mario kart is such a low barrier of entry in terms of intense mechanics.

42
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.880
But like, you know, it is, is it really, do you think it is?

43
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.070
<v 1>I know some people who just, no matter what game it is, some people just don't,</v>

44
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.440
their brains just don't operate. Right. When it comes to like games,

45
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.110
even a simple mechanical, like drifting. They're just like.

46
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.310
<v 0>I think to me, it's like, if they had never wanted a drift, it's fine,</v>

47
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.280
but they wanted a drift and one of the learn, right.

48
00:02:24.281 --> 00:02:26.180
And then it was difficult and they gave up immediately.

49
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.850
And that that's what annoyed me is that they immediately gave up.

50
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.420
<v 1>Well, I mean, not, this is how did you get anything done,</v>

51
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.650
but isn't that the equivalent of you playing Tekken and being like,

52
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.990
I want to do this combo and you try. And you're like, I don't like it.

53
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.900
<v 0>I would try the combo and I'd be at it. I get my clowned on that.</v>

54
00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:42.050
I realize I'm just not getting better at this game.

55
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.430
<v 1>Right? No, not the first.</v>

56
00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:49.920
I would try multiple sessions to get good at it. It's just,

57
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.150
it's just the same thing with, uh, with a different difficulty.

58
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.160
You know what I mean? It's just like,

59
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.670
it's just a different life versus I have three lives.

60
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.020
<v 0>Why? I said I prefaced right in the start. I'm like,</v>

61
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.780
it's not like I'm asking you to get good at StarCraft or anything intense.

62
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.660
I'm not asking you to learn intense mechanics pacing.

63
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.610
It is Mario kart drift explain.

64
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.740
<v 1>Yeah. But you have to understand people for some people that is intense.</v>

65
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.000
I refuse to believe that.

66
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.600
So you're telling your grandma can figure out Marriott car straight away.

67
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.630
<v 0>If you're my age, Mario kart drifting should not be an intense mechanic. I, I,</v>

68
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.560
I think it's like early onset dementia. If that is a problem for you, honestly.

69
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.100
<v 1>There's some big claims.</v>

70
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.260
<v 0>I would expect my grandma to even know how to get like,</v>

71
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.260
just click the menu on the Nintendo switch. Right.

72
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.970
I'm not expecting her to do that. Right. Very extremely basic mechanics. Right.

73
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.800
Like, okay. But this is the, okay. Again, this is not a problem with that.

74
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:50.130
They can't do it. This is, they gave up right away.

75
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.710
The first failure of the first track that like I'm done.

76
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.340
<v 1>Well, maybe because they don't want a challenging experience in a video game.</v>

77
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.340
Maybe they just want to play for like that. You like the Navy seals that.

78
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.340
<v 0>I despised though. Those people [inaudible] No,</v>

79
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.280
I would never expect someone to be good at any video game.

80
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.390
<v 1>Are you trying to say that your play Mario kart for fun? No. No, no.</v>

81
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.630
It's all about the challenge. It's about the huddle. Okay. How about you?

82
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:16.920
<v 0>I would never claim to be,</v>

83
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.500
I want to be good at fighting games and then I'll try and give up, right?

84
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.810
If I want to actually learn something I'm going to, I'm going to do it.

85
00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:23.820
I'm going to throw a hissy fit and give up what, I'm not good at it.

86
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.200
<v 1>That's just how you operate.</v>

87
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.080
So you have to realize not everyone is an Epic game ago.

88
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.130
Some people just don't see games that way. And you just have to accept that.

89
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.960
I just think it was annoying. No, I get it. I get like,

90
00:04:36.961 --> 00:04:39.870
that's annoying to me as well, but I'm not going to get like off at them.

91
00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:41.730
I'm just like, well, that's just, that's just how you play.

92
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.060
That just means probably you just ain't in the game for them.

93
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.600
They just don't like playing games like that.

94
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:49.860
<v 0>Nearly off the top of my head.</v>

95
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.000
I can't think of an easier mechanic to learn than the Mario kart drift. Can you

96
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.090
[inaudible] mechanic go right down.

97
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.040
<v 1>Ugly. I'm celebrating and Mario. No, it's automatic now, Jerry.</v>

98
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.190
Yeah. There's an option. There's an option for what?

99
00:05:05.191 --> 00:05:07.440
It's all automatic by default. So you don't even have to do that.

100
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.860
Turning in Mario cart, baby mode. It's automatic.

101
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.070
What I'm saying there is literally the game plan. That's what I'm saying.

102
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.950
There's a reason why they added those mechanics because for some people,

103
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.710
because they want this it's too much. That's what I'm saying.

104
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.680
They just want the monkey brain near an activation

105
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.510
card might be a baby game. But for some people it's the equivalent of playing.

106
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.520
<v 0>No, I said it was a PB game. I'm just saying right.</v>

107
00:05:29.521 --> 00:05:31.560
What happened to us is that they, they want no,

108
00:05:31.561 --> 00:05:33.450
they were complaining that I was winning. Right.

109
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.270
You'll never going to win if you don't drift. Right.

110
00:05:35.271 --> 00:05:37.230
So my problem was that the complaint that I'm winning,

111
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.380
I told them how I was winning. I explained to them, this is how you can do it.

112
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.540
And how easy of a mechanic it is to learn.

113
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.730
Like you can learn it in one sitting very comfortably.

114
00:05:44.731 --> 00:05:47.160
I think like most people would, if they actually just tried.

115
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.323
So they just gave up.

116
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.850
<v 1>Just, just start winning son, just winning,</v>

117
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.500
winning son. Why are you winning? Why aren't you winning?

118
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.950
It would never get to that point. My son be in discerned before.

119
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.080
<v 0>I would be like, why haven't you won already? So that's why I don't know.</v>

120
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.720
<v 1>My son was winning. Kind of doesn't ask, are you winning?</v>

121
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.630
You're winning riser.

122
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.170
<v 0>Hi, am I the for thinking? That's like, just like, I don't know.</v>

123
00:06:14.171 --> 00:06:15.610
You should maybe just put like, I don't know.

124
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.730
<v 1>Complaining about competitive Mario kart.</v>

125
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.920
<v 0>I complain about the part that they gave up immediately and were like,</v>

126
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.320
I can't do it. I hate when people do that. Like I just.

127
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.120
<v 1>I hate it too, but I'm not like like losing my. I don't give a about it.</v>

128
00:06:31.121 --> 00:06:34.510
It's supposed to give a marriage. If they don't want to win in Mario,

129
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.160
that's America. I don't give a. I can to give a. If someone gives up in America,

130
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.233
guys.

131
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.690
<v 0>I see fit. And I'm like, that's your problem, man. Stop giving up on in life.</v>

132
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:44.800
This is why you get nothing done.

133
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.283
<v 1>The Navy seals,</v>

134
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.590
you never excelled at anything sound because you gave up the first time.

135
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.581
If you'll get it,

136
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:57.370
if you're getting a pissy over someone like losing and Mariko or something and

137
00:06:57.371 --> 00:07:00.190
throwing it in America, something more intensive in life.

138
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.190
<v 0>Out of context, I'm thinking they were getting off.</v>

139
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.620
And then it kind of me off that they were getting off about it.

140
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.660
Cause they didn't put any effort in well.

141
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.910
<v 1>Yeah, but you tried to got me like with a gotcha moment.</v>

142
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.130
<v 0>On fighting games and it's completely not related at all.</v>

143
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.470
<v 1>You.</v>

144
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.350
<v 0>Gave me an entirely different situation. No, no, no, no.</v>

145
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.820
<v 1>We're saying what we're saying is that you got off at someone having a hearsay</v>

146
00:07:21.821 --> 00:07:24.490
thing. I wouldn't even bother getting off at someone having a

147
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.690
[inaudible] to me, I was like, what's wrong? Basic.

148
00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:32.920
Basically the like them giving up or not being able to learn drift in America is

149
00:07:32.921 --> 00:07:34.270
exactly the same situation.

150
00:07:34.271 --> 00:07:37.360
As you not being able to learn the difficulty curve in the fighting game.

151
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.750
<v 0>It's completely different thing. Right? If that was my own choosing. Right.</v>

152
00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:42.940
And I went through that or like someone pushed me on it. They were like,

153
00:07:42.941 --> 00:07:44.260
you should start letting combos. Right.

154
00:07:44.261 --> 00:07:46.030
I can totally understand if I was pushing it on them,

155
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.970
but they wouldn't want to do it. I wouldn't want be good at it because I mean,

156
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.580
that's, I'm putting on them. They never wanted to do it in the first place.

157
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.900
But if we're pushing them to drift, no, I never said that he did no. They said,

158
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.780
how was I winning? I said drifting. And they were like, Oh, I want to do that.

159
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:02.200
I literally said that. So putting words in my mouth, Jerry you.

160
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.240
What I'm saying is like, if I chose, if I was pushed into doing it,

161
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.060
totally understand why you would then give up basically just, Hey,

162
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.120
you just say people who give up. I hate people who give up right away.

163
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:14.463
I hate it, dude.

164
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.040
<v 1>What's what's the right amount before someone gives up when it becomes</v>

165
00:08:18.041 --> 00:08:18.874
acceptable. Yeah.

166
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.430
<v 0>I mean, you can tell if you're like good at something,</v>

167
00:08:21.431 --> 00:08:23.740
when someone just isn't getting the hang of it and they aren't going to get a

168
00:08:23.741 --> 00:08:24.610
hang of it. You know what I mean?

169
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.710
Like if you haven't been doing scent for a long time,

170
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.280
you can just tell they're struggling. Right. Right. But like most people,

171
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.180
like a lot of those people, there's a fair amount.

172
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.750
People out there who are perfectly capable of doing something.

173
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.960
We just give up immediately because they failed the first time. Yeah.

174
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:41.470
Probably where you guys with ranked games. I imagine. I mean,

175
00:08:41.471 --> 00:08:44.020
I don't give up immediately. I just get bored.

176
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.130
<v 1>I don't even, I don't even start.</v>

177
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:50.870
<v 0>Because I know I'm going to hate it because you,</v>

178
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.770
you have a hissy fit when you lose a games. Yeah.

179
00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.190
I don't want to have a hissy fit.

180
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.990
<v 1>When I'm losing a game. Why that's not,</v>

181
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.330
why you get a hissy fit when you lose a game.

182
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.610
Because when does it ever feel that there's someone naming ultimate me a moment

183
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:08.610
where I'm like, Oh man, I lost like, no one says that.

184
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.150
<v 0>I don't give a when I lose it again. I'm like, all right, well, fair enough.</v>

185
00:09:11.151 --> 00:09:13.550
I got, I got out, played, you know, man, what is it? What is that?

186
00:09:13.551 --> 00:09:14.420
Does that feel good to you?

187
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.110
Sometimes if I know where like I could have got wrong with you? No,

188
00:09:18.111 --> 00:09:22.310
I think I hear it. I think it is like, it's a healthier mindset to be of.

189
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.200
I don't mind losing so I can improve.

190
00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.060
<v 1>That's that is the complete opposite experience. My bro, my friend,</v>

191
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.180
the league experiences. me. I lost. Was it my fault?

192
00:09:32.181 --> 00:09:34.130
Or was it my teammate's fault? I have literally no fun.

193
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:37.790
<v 0>No, I did ask no and league when it was completely my fault. I mean,</v>

194
00:09:37.791 --> 00:09:39.380
there are some games, you know, it is horrible.

195
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:44.180
<v 1>There is some games when you it's like the 50 50 game and then your teammate is</v>

196
00:09:44.181 --> 00:09:44.900
just,

197
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.440
Cortel one V five while like you're all doing Baron or something and then you

198
00:09:48.441 --> 00:09:52.130
just lose the game. Thanks for that. And it's that, that feels horrible.

199
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.330
That feels awful.

200
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:56.330
<v 0>It feel great. But then I, you know, you can leave that game, be like, right.</v>

201
00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.550
I could have set that up better. I could have,

202
00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.250
could have done things better that make that w more secured. Right?

203
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.350
<v 1>I don't look at games that deep, man. I just do it to escape.</v>

204
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.320
<v 0>I don't look at it deep. What happens is that I enjoy games.</v>

205
00:10:06.321 --> 00:10:08.480
And then I look into now, when we're talking about it, I'm thinking, okay,

206
00:10:08.481 --> 00:10:10.790
why do I enjoy the games that way? And that's why I'm talking about it now.

207
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.700
I'm not just sitting there my window sill. Like,

208
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:17.180
why do I enjoy suffering league? I don't know.

209
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:22.810
<v 1>Is the question that we're posing. Why do you enjoy [inaudible].</v>

210
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:24.133
<v 0>Play the game.</v>

211
00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:27.170
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

212
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.530
<v 0>I've played a ranked game of league, like two months, man, three months.</v>

213
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.870
<v 1>I went to Liza anonymous and I just, I just said it, man. I was like, yeah,</v>

214
00:10:32.871 --> 00:10:35.010
I'm for leak-free congratulations, everybody claps.

215
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:40.010
I've played a basically I enjoy league the most when I don't care about winning

216
00:10:40.011 --> 00:10:41.690
or losing. Like that's, that's literally,

217
00:10:41.691 --> 00:10:43.880
that's literally my enjoyment of those types of competitive games.

218
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.820
<v 0>And I think Joe is just a little game, a, little, little crybaby boy. Uh,</v>

219
00:10:48.821 --> 00:10:53.600
and that's what we're going to end it today. I'm sorry. I enjoy winning a game.

220
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:56.870
I'm sorry. I just enjoy going to,

221
00:10:56.871 --> 00:10:59.090
so be one of those old people like these kids these days,

222
00:10:59.091 --> 00:11:01.700
they don't know how to lose, let alone how to lose it all.

223
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.260
<v 1>How do they expect to win at life? If they can't even video games?</v>

224
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:13.490
<v 0>How can you expect to win at lifeguard when you can't even take a loss in smash</v>

225
00:11:13.491 --> 00:11:16.780
bros? Joey, I don't know, man. I'm winning so far. It's funny.

226
00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:18.370
Wait until that loss comes along, Joey,

227
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.920
you'll be able to suffer as a human being. You've been to work. Oh no.

228
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:25.970
<v 1>I apologize that I'm giving off a very normal human experience.</v>

229
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.310
People take enough ELLs in life.

230
00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:32.900
Life throws enough people that some people would just want an escape from that.

231
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.420
You know what I mean? Some people want some

232
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:39.980
escape to a secure daddy's literally disagree.
