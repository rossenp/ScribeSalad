1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.460
<v 0>So your boy's been up to anything interesting recently.</v>

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.370
<v 1>I mean, we're currently back in lockdown, always.</v>

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.760
So we haven't really been able to do much really Japanese covers pretty useless.

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.030
I mean, yeah. But.

5
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.280
<v 0>See statement restaurant, please close at eight.</v>

6
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.850
So you can still travel and do whatever you want. But you know.

7
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.060
<v 1>It's not an enforced lockdown in Japan. It's always a suggestion.</v>

8
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.070
It's a suggestion in Japan. People listen. Yeah, no, it's crazy.

9
00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:27.330
I think like, uh, where was it? It was like,

10
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.200
it was because usually after we finished recording a podcast,

11
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.320
we'd go and have dinner and stuff like that. And I think we were at, uh,

12
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.650
like one of the restaurants nearby and they were playing like news footage and

13
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.100
the Shinjuku. Yes. There was a shot of [inaudible] station,

14
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.030
zero people in front of it, which is like crazy because she a station,

15
00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:47.630
if you guys don't know is like literally the most busy station I think.

16
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.300
<v 0>In the world. Isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. It is. Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.200
<v 1>It is at least in Japan, most of the world. I think that doesn't surprise me.</v>

18
00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:57.950
Shinjuku station. I die a little inside. Whenever someone,

19
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.850
whenever a friend comes to Japan, I asked where to me and they say, [inaudible].

20
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.050
<v 0>Okay. Meeting at Shinjuku station is impossible, but like navigating it.</v>

21
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.100
Isn't so bad. Yeah.

22
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.090
<v 1>Oh, I hate nothing is worse than navigator. Oh,</v>

23
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.880
what are you on? Because when you try and get to like the other ones.

24
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.520
<v 0>Like the subway lines, you'd like, for some reason.</v>

25
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.750
<v 1>She literally has like 30 exits has maybe like 10,</v>

26
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.350
like depending on which exit you come out of sh sh Shinjuku,

27
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.740
like it tells you to go on the other side of the station and you would think

28
00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:29.810
walking in a straight line would work. No,

29
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.630
you can't walk in a straight line in Shinjuku because you've got to pass

30
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.100
depending on where you're on the station.

31
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.060
You've got to pass through like 10 different [inaudible] station. I always,

32
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.000
if someone's just like meet at this gate that I don't know where the it is,

33
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.240
then I'll just go out of the regular gate and I can at least walk around the

34
00:01:44.241 --> 00:01:47.060
station. But if you try and do that with Shinjuku station, you're.

35
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.350
If you ever come to your pan and you're going to meet anyone here and you're

36
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:52.790
staying and you're staying there,

37
00:01:52.791 --> 00:01:57.500
Shinjuku never say you're going to meet at Shinjuku station. It is a lie.

38
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.340
Okay.

39
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.580
It's saying you're going to meet at Shinjuku station is like saying you're going

40
00:02:01.581 --> 00:02:04.170
to meet somewhere in like times square or something.

41
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.510
It's a massive area and station doesn't do it.

42
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:11.810
It's not even that it's like saying like, I'll meet you in New York. It's like,

43
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.063
all right, cool.

44
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.560
<v 0>Like a place outside of the station and then send them the Google.</v>

45
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.550
<v 1>Yeah. But you could do that with any other station.</v>

46
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.880
It'd be way easier to get out of it. Cause I, I remember I, uh,

47
00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:26.720
I met Jeff here mother's basement at Shinjuku station.

48
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.220
And as soon as he said it, I was like, Oh, here we go. God, I got to find,

49
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.610
it's basically finding where's Wally with your mates. And you know, with Jeff,

50
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.330
is it shouldn't be hard cause he's massive. Right. And he says, um, he,

51
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:42.290
I asked him where he is and he goes, Oh, I'm uh, near this place. I think it's,

52
00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:46.290
it looks like there's a big camera nearby. I'm like, cool. It's like,

53
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.450
cool. So I go to like the nearest big camera in.

54
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:55.130
So big camera is like this huge department store. Um, that is just like,

55
00:02:55.131 --> 00:02:57.350
it's like electronic store basically. Um,

56
00:02:57.351 --> 00:03:01.780
so I go to the UW West Shinjuku B camera,

57
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.770
and then I send him the message and I'm just like, okay, I'm outside big camera.

58
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:08.760
And he goes, I don't see you and I'm go buck.

59
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.950
It was that at that point I knew ticks off a one. I up. And I, and I,

60
00:03:13.951 --> 00:03:17.760
and I tell him just to send me the Google map coordinates and he's on the other

61
00:03:17.761 --> 00:03:20.070
side of the station is that Shinjuku.

62
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.890
<v 0>You're West on Google maps. It's so much easier.</v>

63
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.850
Also you can just literally meet at like one station.

64
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.810
Cause some of the stations lie with how to get places and like [inaudible] as

65
00:03:30.811 --> 00:03:32.880
well has like a East West exit or so.

66
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.420
<v 1>Not dude Shinjuku is like has like seven West.</v>

67
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.950
It has an East West exit. Yeah. That doesn't,

68
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.620
it doesn't even like who doesn't even have an East West exit.

69
00:03:43.621 --> 00:03:47.740
I think Shinjuku has like an East West exit and a new East West exit.

70
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.350
That's how many exits their own Shinjuku that they've literally run out of

71
00:03:52.351 --> 00:03:54.960
directions to name the exits.

72
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.220
<v 0>I missed the train stations in Wales where it's just a platform. What was it?</v>

73
00:03:59.221 --> 00:04:02.130
That was the whole station, maybe a vending machine. If you're lucky.

74
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.650
<v 1>Honestly like what I usually do. Well,</v>

75
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.260
I've done this with a few people and it's actually proven to be effective is

76
00:04:07.261 --> 00:04:08.820
that instead of meeting in Shinjuku,

77
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.050
you meet one station down on the amount of which is Yogi. Because walking,

78
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.430
because walking to your Yogi,

79
00:04:14.431 --> 00:04:18.810
like from your yoga to Shinjuku is the exact same time that it will take to

80
00:04:18.811 --> 00:04:22.830
actually get out of Shinjuku station is because walking from one side of the

81
00:04:22.831 --> 00:04:26.130
station to another, depending on where you are could take up to 15 to 20.

82
00:04:26.131 --> 00:04:29.010
Exactly. Whereas like Yogi only has two exits,

83
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.720
very straightforward Nobre passions. What do you mean?

84
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.400
I'm doing what you love to do best? Which is midmaxing myself. Okay.

85
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.850
Well what is the optimal strategy? Right? Google has this thing now.

86
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.860
<v 0>Where it tells you which cart to get on.</v>

87
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.870
So it tells you which train car to get on for the smoothest and quickest exit

88
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.290
and 95% of the time. It's spot on. Just do that.

89
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.160
<v 1>I see a trick question though. There is no smooth exit or Shinjuku. There is,</v>

90
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.053
there is never.

91
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.450
<v 0>I have legit. Like I always have to Goshen. Juki right.</v>

92
00:05:00.451 --> 00:05:03.270
And obviously I'm always to do that because I need to,

93
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.140
and I listened to what Google, my God, Google tells me, you know,

94
00:05:07.141 --> 00:05:10.020
every time and it bang on, it's like go this exit globe,

95
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.350
the first set of stairs you see every single time it's basically right.

96
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.170
<v 1>You think someone who just come to came to Japan ball,</v>

97
00:05:16.171 --> 00:05:19.950
like which direction of Shinjuku and which ex there are,

98
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.020
I don't even know where to exit. I get out of.

99
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.990
<v 0>I mean, it works for me. I just listened to what the PC,</v>

100
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.770
the PC master race tells me. If the computer's telling me to go somewhere.

101
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.850
I go where the computer center.

102
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.910
<v 1>Okay. Carnival. The first time you come to Japan, don't do that.</v>

103
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.840
<v 0>I know how to do it. Find where you want to go. When you go to the station,</v>

104
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.600
there'll be numbers on the floor. Just pick the number,

105
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.570
what the Google tells you to go on and then do it. Trust.

106
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.630
<v 1>Shinjuku. You all get lost navigating the state. Yeah.</v>

107
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.020
<v 0>Don't don't trust the station signs. Cause there'll be like, Oh yeah,</v>

108
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.570
if you're on the platform, be like the exit this way.

109
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.090
<v 1>Well, you can go trust the station. That's all I've got. Because,</v>

110
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.970
because when you go to Shinjuku and you follow Google maps, right?

111
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.040
Google maps says, take the West exit out of Shinjuku. And then you go,

112
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:03.800
you go to, you go out of your trailer, you go see the signs.

113
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.320
And there is literally every exit. But the exit that it says on Google,

114
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.540
they've made the mistake.

115
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.280
<v 0>You're looking at the signs, right? The signs, the signs,</v>

116
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.970
all they do is deceive you. They, they make you second guess. Right?

117
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.680
Don't listen to the silence full of.

118
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.830
Listen to what Google says a hundred percent, right? Because thing is right.

119
00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:24.820
You'll be on the platform. Right?

120
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.580
And there'll be like eight sets of stairs that you can take.

121
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.320
That will be an hour. This is like this way.

122
00:06:29.321 --> 00:06:30.700
This is the way to where you want to go.

123
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.740
And sometimes it's like the most unoptimized way to get out of like out of the

124
00:06:35.741 --> 00:06:37.690
station or go to the line that you want to go. Right.

125
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.420
And there's a bunch of stairs. And sometimes it isn't clear which stairs to get.

126
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.930
It's a mess. Right? If Google tells you to get off at a cart,

127
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.530
go immediately to the nearest set of stairs that you see it.

128
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.160
I guarantee it'll work. And just go out the accident that you see closest.

129
00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:54.570
It'll always work. Google knows. Don't listen to the signs there.

130
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.450
<v 1>Try it, boys. You'll see. I dunno, man. I,</v>

131
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.360
I think I'll just avoid getting off fishing. I just,

132
00:07:04.361 --> 00:07:07.480
I just feel like not going through Shinjuku is just the optimal straps.

133
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.520
<v 0>I'm just, I want to fly out of the country without an airport. It's like,</v>

134
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.040
if I'm going to go to Japan, you're going to be going through Shinjuku.

135
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.560
But like I rather them.

136
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.760
<v 1>Like somewhere far away from the actual station out of this place to</v>

137
00:07:21.761 --> 00:07:25.750
meet somewhere, anywhere near the station. Yeah. Because it's just extra.

138
00:07:25.751 --> 00:07:28.510
It's just extra stress you're adding on to your commute.

139
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.610
Like if I do it for you, I don't know because it,

140
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.710
I have tried following the AI and Google maps. Isn't perfect. It's pretty good.

141
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.060
Is this, what is this why you hate? [inaudible] more because the AI.

142
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.800
<v 0>Maps, I have no clue.</v>

143
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.820
<v 1>So that's why you hate, you can give it shot.</v>

144
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.120
<v 0>A mess of a station the way it's been laid out. Like shouldn't you cute?</v>

145
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.170
I get it. It makes sense.

146
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:58.360
<v 1>It doesn't say about EK Bukaro is that the science makes sense.</v>

147
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:03.190
You can see the [inaudible] that when I follow her assigned to an exit,

148
00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:05.620
it actually takes me to the eggs. Like,

149
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.860
because I like putting my trust in my own sense of direction. Right.

150
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.000
So if I'm in a place like Ethabuka though, I can trust that wherever I am,

151
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.690
I can find the right way out. I just follow the signs. I just follow the signs,

152
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.320
not the right way with Shinjuku. Um,

153
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:25.270
