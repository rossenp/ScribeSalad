00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.550
<v 0>So I I'm, I'm critiquing your scores here knowing that, you know,</v>

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.980
some of these anime I've also scored myself, but I have no idea.

3
00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:09.170
What I said is my list was done in 2014. Holy.

4
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.600
Seven years ago. Yeah. I see. You've given narrative a six compared to bleach.

5
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.970
So would you say that you preferred bleach over,

6
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.140
[inaudible] never dropped a show more times than I have narratives,

7
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.340
like narratives being one of those shows where it's like, I've, I've watched it,

8
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.550
I've read it and watched it like close to the end.

9
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.680
But along that way,

10
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.190
there were so many points throughout an hour narrative where I'm just like, ah,

11
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.770
maybe it's not worth it or you didn't get that with bleach out.

12
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.330
So I did get that. But with bleach once during the Eisenach that's it? Yeah.

13
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.300
I mean, bleeds for me was just like a constant downhill narrative.

14
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.440
Just kind of went up and down. And I, I think back to,

15
00:00:51.441 --> 00:00:53.830
I think back sometimes I think it's not, it was narrative,

16
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.940
a good show when it would hold up to this day.

17
00:00:55.941 --> 00:00:57.820
And I still think some of the best parts narrowed.

18
00:00:57.821 --> 00:01:02.480
So I still like a amazing, yeah, yeah, no again. And that's,

19
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.610
and that's why I probably gave it a six. Right. It's because like,

20
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.740
I completely understand why it is one of the most beloved enemy out there

21
00:01:09.741 --> 00:01:13.610
today. And so like, I saw parts of that, but again, this was,

22
00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:16.850
I didn't grow up with no retard. Like a lot of people did, like, this was again,

23
00:01:16.851 --> 00:01:18.620
another show that this is just another show.

24
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.640
This is just another show in infamy. Right, right, right. Yeah. So again,

25
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.620
I'm not saying that narrative is bad. I'd just like to point that out.

26
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.090
It's not bad, but it's 10 out of 10 for me. Okay.

27
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.420
I'm trying to see you. What else? I feel like I'm getting interrogated.

28
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.820
This isn't in terrorism, interrogation, interrogation. This is like true crime.

29
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.520
We're British. And you know, so this, this hand move,

30
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.710
his hands are off the table saying that he is quite nervous. Sorry. We're not,

31
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.640
we're not like, okay. So what is the lowest one that you've rated on here?

32
00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:56.750
I'm trying to see. I'm trying to see. Oh, it's I think it's pupa.

33
00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.160
Oh yeah. Pupa. I get people one. I think I get Balkan to Pico one. Yeah.

34
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.210
One of the biggest thing that surprised me going through your list is okay.

35
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.010
Be honest. Have you completed every animate you've scored on here? Yes. No way.

36
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.800
No way. So many, except for maybe [inaudible]

37
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.700
[inaudible] cause it's still going after 15 minutes was my son.

38
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.020
I honestly think I have finished everything because like I remember one of,

39
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.431
when are we going to get to my list?

40
00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:33.260
One of the reasons why my list seems like a lot emptier is because if I don't

41
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:36.830
complete a show, I just don't bother putting in my list. Right. Well,

42
00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:39.680
that's why I have like the on-hold section as well. Oh, you got the.

43
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.200
When did you stop updating this man

44
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.550
really worthy anime man for this? What the? You watch so much anime.

45
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.140
You've also read a Tokyo ghoul season one. The same as season two. Right?

46
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.060
Come on. They are, to me to be fair.

47
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.030
I would rate what did I give season one into?

48
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.440
What do you think you gave season one or two?

49
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.350
I think I gave season one and two like seven. Maybe you did. Okay. Yeah.

50
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.410
[inaudible] season two. Maybe like a four. I was going to say it's it's like,

51
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.550
I give it like a, I dunno what I was on about.

52
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.100
I'd give it like a fry Gunnar seven. You stand by that. Yeah. Yeah, really?

53
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.070
Okay. There were a lot of parts about Tragon I really enjoy.

54
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.210
But I think the problem we tried on is that I was a little too overhyped when I

55
00:03:30.211 --> 00:03:32.820
came into it, because I heard so many people being like,

56
00:03:32.821 --> 00:03:36.570
yo try gun is like same levels as like, you know,

57
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.840
buck on a cowboy vivo. It's like, it's like up there with the big,

58
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.450
like classic leagues. I'm like, all right, I'll get into it.

59
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.630
And I watched it and again, it was good, but not to give spoilers,

60
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.370
but the last quarter of Tragon I was like, the is going on. Yeah,

61
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.870
really, really. I thought the last quarter of Tricon was great. It was great.

62
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.160
I enjoyed it, but I was like, what the is going on? I mean, I spent a long time.

63
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.910
I haven't watched it in literally decades now

64
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.850
since I was trying on, Oh, that's the no Tempest as well. You give that a seven.

65
00:04:08.851 --> 00:04:12.060
That is that like, if there was a benchmark for seven out of 10 shows,

66
00:04:12.061 --> 00:04:15.120
it would be [inaudible] I actually,

67
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.870
I can't remember whatever I say now. It's like a isn't it based on the show?

68
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.290
The Shakespeare, I mean, was it basically shut?

69
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.360
Cause I think it was originally very,

70
00:04:24.361 --> 00:04:26.640
very loosely and buy it off a Shakespeare store.

71
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.620
I don't remember which one it was, but I gave,

72
00:04:28.621 --> 00:04:32.850
I gave a points because at the time it was quite creative and useful.

73
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.690
I really liked it.

74
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.220
Like it's one of I put is that sooner and the Tempest in the same category as I

75
00:04:38.221 --> 00:04:41.730
do dark and then black. Right. When I watched, when I watched it,

76
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.460
it was kind of like it, when I think back I was like,

77
00:04:44.461 --> 00:04:46.680
it seems average my memory, but for some,

78
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.150
but for some reason it sticks with me and I always, I always think back,

79
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.450
I always think back to this show. Right? What did you see? What did you see?

80
00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.540
God, God, no, I did finish my point.
