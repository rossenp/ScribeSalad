<v 0>Can, we can ignore the filth in the middle.</v>

<v 1>Honestly, in the middle. I don't it's already.</v>

8
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.570
<v 0>Okay. So, so, so lemme, lemme, lemme, let me spell out my three by three. Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.340
So from, uh, top left, uh, going down, uh,

10
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.970
row by row. Yeah. So you've got your name. Barno fate,

11
00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:38.840
zero Yvonne Galyon or emo log horizon,

12
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.820
one piece, uh,

13
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.600
he or the disappearance and black little does scream.

14
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.100
Someone had gone to anime and the tooth.

15
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.613
<v 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

16
00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.060
[inaudible] not gonna lie. I'm not gonna lie.

17
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.370
I was not expecting black lagoon to be there.

18
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.160
<v 0>I can see it really. Okay. So there's nothing like it.</v>

19
00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.830
I've never heard anything about black women coming from craftsmen. No,

20
00:01:03.831 --> 00:01:05.240
it's great. I'm just curious.

21
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.070
<v 1>Zone's review on it.</v>

22
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.840
<v 0>It's it's Brit.</v>

23
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.440
It's one of the shows that I haven't had too much of a chance to talk about,

24
00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:14.720
but like before, before I get into that, let me, let me, let me,

25
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.680
let me tell you the thought process that I.

26
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.660
<v 1>Right.</v>

27
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.890
<v 0>Let me tell you this much emotion.</v>

28
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.810
Let me tell you the thought process I put into like picking Scott, because I,

29
00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:30.590
I, you know, at, at the beginning I was like, how the do I pick my favorites?

30
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.670
Cause I have like too many favorites I can talk about. Right. So then,

31
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.360
so then I thought, okay, here's his, here's a big thing.

32
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.580
What if I just pick the anime that I have rewatched? Okay.

33
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.120
Because if, if I've rewatched something and this is like rewatching,

34
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.160
not for my job, but rewatching for my own enjoyment,

35
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.720
if I've rewatched something,

36
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.770
that means there is something special about that show that has stuck with me,

37
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.150
that I felt like I've wanted to go out of my way to re-experience that.

38
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.620
I agree with that. Even, even on some shows that I think is great.

39
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.120
Like for example, like stuff like monster or like Kylie critical, he came,

40
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.240
claimed shows you don't want to rewatch. Exactly.

41
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.250
I feel like it's had this time in the sun,

42
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.730
but in terms of like what I truly like enjoyed to the core,

43
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.600
I wouldn't go out my eye at the moment. I wouldn't go out and rewatch monster,

44
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.420
you know, I, I wouldn't do that. Okay. Hold on. But I get that right.

45
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.570
Like I'm looking at this right now being like yeah. Rewatch that rewatch that.

46
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.460
Yeah. Would you rewatch one piece rewatched, one piece.

47
00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:34.250
Is it even possible to rebuild it? Okay. Okay. Okay.

48
00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:39.110
Here's the thing I've got to get a time machine or some I've watched one piece

49
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.800
or basically up to, up to the time,

50
00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:46.520
skip all the way once and then I've rewatched it again once. Uh,

51
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.750
and then I've rewatched. Some of my favorite marks. The time I have 600,

52
00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:52.070
I know it is.

53
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.790
And this was back when I have time to watch anime.

54
00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.730
And I would just like, whenever I got, whenever I, you really watch, right?

55
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:02.200
I thought you were talking about like, Oh,

56
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.590
I've rewatched the water seven article that I rewatched alabaster.

57
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.453
I didn't think.

58
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.350
<v 1>You really shown your age. You need years to rewatch that one thing.</v>

59
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.240
The one that year older than me, like, me.

60
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.540
<v 0>I love that you compensate. It'd be like, no, no. Only up until the PR,</v>

61
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:16.800
but all the time, if I'm like.

62
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.600
<v 1>It's still like $400.</v>

63
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.980
<v 0>This is why like I was having trouble putting a show in a non,</v>

64
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.790
because I'm just like, is there any shown him that I actually truly love that?

65
00:03:26.791 --> 00:03:29.070
I would think that I would go back anytime,

66
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.630
because I was going to put you Hawk show. And I was thinking.

67
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.790
<v 1>Seven deadly sins. I'll come here. [inaudible].</v>

68
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.290
<v 0>But like one piece to me will go down when it finishes,</v>

69
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.090
we'll go down as well.

70
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.320
It already is one of the greatest anime slash manga series course.

71
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.340
But to me when I think back and I think back because one piece isn't the perfect

72
00:03:50.341 --> 00:03:55.020
show, right? I've rewatched one piece. So like claim it is like everyone,

73
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.630
everyone forgets about the lows of one piece where everyone forgets about the

74
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.920
Skylar. And I wasn't a fan of the Foxy arc,

75
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.070
which was a filler cannon arc that everyone doesn't talk about.

76
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.600
<v 1>You know what I mean? These things are so fun.</v>

77
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.000
<v 0>Dresses. Rosa was, was like, um, it was too long. It was dragged out to,</v>

78
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.550
but nothing in my opinion can touch the highs of one piece

79
00:04:20.551 --> 00:04:23.440
when, when one piece is at its best. Right? Yeah. I,

80
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:27.930
I think it is the greatest, the greatest thing. You can find an anime.

81
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.860
I will stand by and say, even though I've watched every MITRE, June enemy,

82
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.950
I've cried more times watching one piece than any other.

83
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.850
<v 1>That many episodes you saw something's going to hit. Right? Like, me.</v>

84
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.820
<v 0>Was that I wasn't expecting. I mean,</v>

85
00:04:41.821 --> 00:04:45.780
like there's plenty of shows that have a lot of episodes and haven't had the

86
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.003
highs, the one piece house.

87
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.540
<v 1>Sam man has some</v>

88
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.610
[inaudible] has some pretty high highs, man.

89
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.910
<v 0>What I find amazing about one piece is this it's been going on for like what,</v>

90
00:04:56.911 --> 00:05:00.240
20 years now? Almost 30 now, almost like, I can't remember when it started.

91
00:05:00.241 --> 00:05:05.220
I think it started in 96, 98 or 96 or something. Something like that. Yeah.

92
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.470
But I remember I've,

93
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.120
I've just caught up with the Mongo with like what the one at arc,

94
00:05:09.121 --> 00:05:10.990
which is now one of the longest socks. It's so long. They,

95
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.870
it has three parts and it still has moments that make me feel

96
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.200
magical. This is like one piece is like,

97
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.950
like I watched some of the best moments in one piece and I get reminded,

98
00:05:22.951 --> 00:05:26.160
this is why a love animate. This is why I love love Mongo.

99
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.120
This is why I love this medium. I'm the author of one piece I intend.

100
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.430
<v 1>For it to be as long as it is where you're just like, it just popularized.</v>

101
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.100
<v 0>I,</v>

102
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.020
I think he had planned because the thing about one piece is that it's this long.

103
00:05:37.021 --> 00:05:40.710
And yet there are there's foreshadowing that that's happened.

104
00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:44.130
Like hundreds of chapters. He's not from this planet. That is, that is,

105
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.080
that is being explored now. Right.

106
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.020
And I think he didn't expect it to be this long, but he,

107
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:50.550
but when he got popular,

108
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.790
he realized he can explore basically every idea here that he wanted people.

109
00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:57.340
A lot of people, I feel kind of undermined odor just because it's like, Oh,

110
00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.290
he made one piece, but whatever it's so long, blah, blah, blah.

111
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.450
But I think people, when you look deep into it,

112
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:05.370
people really undermine his skill for storytelling because yeah,

113
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.400
let's be honest. You have to be to keep people captivated. Yeah. He's,

114
00:06:09.401 --> 00:06:12.580
he's been, he's been number one on Sean and John for the past, like 15 years.

115
00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:12.970
Yeah.

116
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.540
<v 1>Yeah. You don't do that by law. [inaudible].</v>

117
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.191
<v 0>Yeah. And like,</v>

118
00:06:18.191 --> 00:06:22.270
what I find amazing is it's been going on this long and it's not one, not it's,

119
00:06:22.271 --> 00:06:25.090
it's not only got still got amazing moments in it.

120
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.920
Even when some of the greatest, uh,

121
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.010
in some of the latest chapters and some of the latest moments, but to,

122
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.660
no matter how far you go into one piece, you feel like there's still an upswing.

123
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.270
You still, you still feel like he hasn't peaked yet. And like,

124
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:39.580
how would you write a story?

125
00:06:39.581 --> 00:06:43.690
That's like almost almost a thousand chapters long. And you still think, man,

126
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.640
there's an upswing coming. It's insane. Every time a new arc started.

127
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.940
Yeah. And I would keep up to date with what the mongers were saying.

128
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.300
Everyone would be like, how is it that the next arc is even better?

129
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.420
How does it keep getting better? I thought this was the peak.

130
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.080
And then it just keeps getting the hot dog stand Ark, keep.

131
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:03.543
<v 1>Blown me away.</v>

132
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.540
How does the water park adventure Supreme are keep blowing me away.

133
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.280
The names don't make sense. It is literally.

134
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:16.120
<v 0>Prosey D video where he talks about anime arc names and like any one piece fan</v>

135
00:07:16.121 --> 00:07:19.600
who's watched that video knows that he's just calling out one piece fans there

136
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.720
because we will literally talking about this video before the podcast started.

137
00:07:22.721 --> 00:07:25.720
And we were just mean, we enjoy, we was just talking about the big Mark.

138
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.260
<v 1>It's funny. I was just like, Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, wait,</v>

139
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.860
that's a real serious. So they were joking.

140
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.330
She was like big momma's house or something.

141
00:07:34.331 --> 00:07:35.980
I thought it was just a shirt like that.

142
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.020
<v 0>Right? Like when I,</v>

143
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.980
when I remember when I've watched the alabaster rock in one piece, I was like,

144
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.310
this is the greatest thing ever made. And then water seven came out. I was like,

145
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:45.910
how is that?

146
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:50.710
<v 1>How was it getting better? [inaudible] I hate to rush you guys,</v>

147
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.790
but you have nine animated talk.

148
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.290
I can talk about one piece of the sunglasses because frankly,

149
00:07:56.291 --> 00:07:59.230
I don't really want to hear your opinions. I honestly do not care.

150
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:00.473
I already know you.

151
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.650
<v 0>Well, I already know your opinions on your name.</v>

152
00:08:02.651 --> 00:08:05.740
I already have names on feed back in there is like saying I like coming

153
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.650
back and I was like, I like sex. Of course. It's fun. It's just fun.

154
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.860
And then we've, we've gushed over. Haringey obviously right.

155
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:16.450
Like Cal disappearance is amazing.

156
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.300
<v 1>Okay. I'm very, I'm excited to see that. Cause.</v>

157
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.410
<v 0>I was thinking back to, because obviously I'm the East iron man. Right.</v>

158
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.000
And I was thinking like,

159
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.350
log of horizon is the ISA Kaia come back to because it's the only East archive

160
00:08:29.351 --> 00:08:32.770
rewatched out of everything. Like zero.

161
00:08:32.771 --> 00:08:35.940
I watched because it was my job. You know what I mean? I, I, that,

162
00:08:35.941 --> 00:08:36.880
that was literally the only reason I,

163
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.480
what for zero look at Ryzen is the only ISA I've come back to be like, man,

164
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.490
that was, there was some good moments in this.

165
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:46.300
And I really want to re-experience some of these ideas that she's in threes out,

166
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.780
I'm probably going to rewatch it. Now it's out this season.

167
00:08:49.781 --> 00:08:54.370
So I'm probably going to read like lock rises the only like pure ISA Chi

168
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.740
right now that I can like recommend without it's got no catch.

169
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.160
Like it's not like zero where it's like, Oh, it's, it's a time loop catch.

170
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.350
You know? That's, that's the interesting thing about it. Look horizon.

171
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.740
It's just, Hey guys, Hey guys, there's a gimmick walk horizon.

172
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.510
It's just an e-cig guy. That is just a good ISA guy. I actually, I agree.

173
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.580
I agree. It deserves to be, it has its place there.

174
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:19.170
I just can't get over the fact that you aren't ironically like Auriemma. Okay.

175
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.440
I just like, for the longest time, I'm like, what is it a about?

176
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.930
I thought it was like the child blessed. Yeah. That's it right?

177
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.230
It's it's not about insect. It is about incest just happens in it.

178
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:30.383
It's not about

179
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.590
[inaudible] difference between the two it's about incest and Bisco getting

180
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:41.730
cocked. That's what that show's about. There's incest in it. Like it's like,

181
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.470
like, like a center of a flavor.

182
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.690
Like you can't just drop that in there and be like, Oh,

183
00:09:45.691 --> 00:09:48.180
there's also incessantly. Like what, what do you mean?

184
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:53.190
Because it's just a small thing insists to you. It is something. Okay. So

185
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:59.370
let me defend in incest 4k edition. I'm I'm, I'm a, I'm a do it, man.

186
00:09:59.371 --> 00:10:03.720
I'm a dude. I don't care if this like, watch this clips, get, watch this clip,

187
00:10:03.721 --> 00:10:06.210
get me canceled in like four years or like four years.

188
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.210
Watch this clip in 40 minutes, give a counselor like one month.

189
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.223
You know what I mean?

190
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:15.420
Everyone forgets that Orrin Mo was a legitimately good show.

191
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:19.350
When it first aired, I'm going to have to stop you. Right. There was a,

192
00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.000
I'm going to have to show it right there.

193
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.830
Like everyone thinks I put Auriemma on the same level of something like Aaron

194
00:10:24.831 --> 00:10:26.670
Monga sensei, no Aramark.

195
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:31.770
Since they was trashed from episode one and it knew it was trash and it's

196
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.130
every Monga sensor is what happens when you take all the trashiest parts of

197
00:10:35.131 --> 00:10:40.020
Oromo and put that and put that into a show. Oromo was a nice,

198
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:44.280
wholesome look at otaku culture and with incest.

199
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.540
And the thing is the thing is the thing is when it was airing,

200
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.610
everyone was just like, Oh yeah, this is,

201
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.300
this is a parody of all like the incest lighten levels and everything like that.

202
00:10:54.301 --> 00:10:55.770
Right? This is, this is just, this is just

203
00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:04.470
[inaudible] everyone thought that he was just taking the out of like, you know,

204
00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:09.330
this, the little girl Emoto craze happening in anatomy and lineup.

205
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.630
And if, if you, if you don't watch the final three episodes,

206
00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:17.460
you can watch the entire series of series of Oromo and just think that, um,

207
00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:21.990
and then the final three episodes happened and it, yeah, that, uh, that,

208
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.870
that sparked an outcry cried. It it's it's sparked an outcry. Right?

209
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:30.930
It's it's uh, it definitely, uh, because th th the reason,

210
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:35.380
the reason it sparked an outcry was because no one was actually expecting it.

211
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.300
It went from like 20% incest to 99%.

212
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.950
It was a hundred percent. There was, there was no,

213
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.410
there was no percentage that could be shaved off.

214
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:51.200
It went full in CESO and it was unapologetic. Admit that it would fall inside.

215
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:56.100
It's in your top nine enemy, because the reason it's okay,

216
00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:00.130
I have rewatched it because it is, we watched it. Yeah. I,

217
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.630
I I've already said I've rewatched everything on this list.

218
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:09.060
I don't even want to see, because this, this show,

219
00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:14.100
like this show is the epitome of everything I love about trashy,

220
00:12:14.101 --> 00:12:18.990
Hara, manga, and anime. It's when you say that, it just sounds like satire.

221
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:22.260
It sounds like sad is not. Okay.

222
00:12:22.261 --> 00:12:27.000
So remember when you went through my enemy list, I gave eeky Towson a two.

223
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.750
So like back when I was a teenager, I was just like, you couldn't incest. Yo,

224
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.030
yo, I'm, I'm, I'm better than this fan service.

225
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.690
I'm better than this trash anime. Um, I got good taste.

226
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.770
This is the show that changed all that. When I was just like,

227
00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.110
why am I enjoying this so much?

228
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.940
Why do I like this filth trash show? I mean, look, I mean, look,

229
00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.330
I mean, look, I look, shows like that. Yeah.

230
00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:52.710
She assists being a perfect example.

231
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.470
I didn't put it in my three by three of them. Yeah.

232
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:59.070
This is really putting incest top nine middle.

233
00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.780
I will that. That was a legitimate, deliberate choice.

234
00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:07.620
I put it in the middle. Cause I'm just like, this is this show.

235
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:13.350
This show has probably had the biggest overall things or my taste

236
00:13:13.351 --> 00:13:14.310
in modern anime.

237
00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:18.330
You literally man email out to be like the free space and a bingo card.

238
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:25.380
I did it. And because it is, yeah, it is, is a trash.

239
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.750
The me right in there. There are trashy moments in there,

240
00:13:27.751 --> 00:13:32.450
but I think I will defend the point that my wasn't complete trash. There,

241
00:13:32.451 --> 00:13:36.360
there was some legitimately good heartwarming moments in there and it wasn't

242
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.450
complete. It wasn't all trash. Okay. It wasn't, it wasn't a remortgage.

243
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.540
It really was. It wasn't very long. You're going to jail.

244
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.770
Aira Munga sensei is aura, EMA rescan. That's all it is.

245
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.200
And you have to admit to that. No, I don't.

246
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:53.520
You have to remember every Monga sensei is the trashiest possible Oromo

247
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.120
concentrated. It is. It is dense orange

248
00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.810
[inaudible] she was 12. You're honest. You're on it. Ladies and gentlemen,

249
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.370
this man has the largest animate YouTube channel on the platform. He said,

250
00:14:05.371 --> 00:14:08.880
this is what he said. I'm I'm proud of this. I put it.

251
00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:13.380
I literally put this stuff front and center. I regret nothing.

252
00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:17.460
I regret nothing. That is all my computer now.

253
00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.140
And I can't wait to use it as blackmail.
