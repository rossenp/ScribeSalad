WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
<v 0>But yeah, back to my school trip to America,</v>

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.560
it was my first time ever going to America. Right. And, uh,

3
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.320
I remember those two things. I was really excited for going to America,

4
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.010
which I think they were in and out. No, I didn't go there.

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.980
I only went to New York and went to New York, the food.

6
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.910
I wanted two things from what I'd seen from media. I want to Twinkies.

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.430
I wanted mountain dude, not a mountain doing UK. They do,

8
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:26.760
but it's not like it's the stuff without like the green stuff in it,

9
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.580
because that, that stuff's illegal in the UK. So our mountain,

10
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.900
our mountain dude just tastes like Sprite. What we have, we have it,

11
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:36.300
but it's not that popular. And it doesn't taste like mountain Dew at all.

12
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.700
<v 1>Really proper mountain day.</v>

13
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.850
What the is in mountain Dew that makes it illegal in the UK.

14
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.070
<v 0>The stuff that makes it super green, really.</v>

15
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.760
<v 1>Like, cause I'm pretty sure like all the sodas in the UK,</v>

16
00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:48.410
you're not allowed to use corn syrup either.

17
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.230
Like in a ma like Coke and soda in America tastes different from like sodas in

18
00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:57.860
the UK. In fact, those have less sugar in it as well. It has,

19
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.090
it has like a little less sugar and you can taste it. You can,

20
00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:00.924
you can definitely taste.

21
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.480
<v 0>I had like proper mountain Dew or I guess now I know is proper mountain Dew in</v>

22
00:01:05.481 --> 00:01:08.060
America was like, I'll show you. I might have different. It might not,

23
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.980
but Twinkies, Twinkies or.

24
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.790
Why did you think it was good?

25
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.370
Cause in all the TV shows they made Twinkies look amazing.

26
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.900
And then I had to wait. Yeah. And I'm like, from what TV show,

27
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.000
like zombie land actually. Cause he's obsessed with them in zombie land.

28
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.040
Oh yeah. I also learned that they were like, can survive nuclear or something.

29
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.860
Yeah. I don't think that's, I don't think that's true at all. But in family guy,

30
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.500
I wonder how much Twinkies paid zombie land. Like that was fantastic.

31
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.930
That was like five head advertised.

32
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.590
I went there as a teenager and I just want it.

33
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.040
<v 1>This spongy thing that you put into your mouth, survival food during it,</v>

34
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.880
during apocalypse, by God. So like I.

35
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.060
<v 0>Prone to getting like nosebleeds as well. Uh, until I got my nose cauterized.</v>

36
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.730
All right. Which is like, when you get like Burnett. Yeah. Um,

37
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.880
so I was getting used to it. If it got like even remotely hot,

38
00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:01.250
I would get nosebleeds really. So when I went to America,

39
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:03.320
it was just too hot in the summer and I was just everyday.

40
00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:06.850
I had nose bleeds a lot. Doesn't get in New York in the summer. It's pretty hot.

41
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.463
I remember I went to.

42
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.060
<v 1>Once in the summer and it was like pretty hot and humid.</v>

43
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.610
<v 0>Like in the thirties. I don't know why I thought,</v>

44
00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:15.980
because it's the so-called in the window. I would assume we'd get,

45
00:02:15.981 --> 00:02:18.140
got like quite cool in the summer. It was great though.

46
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.690
Cause any of the like really boring places, I would just be like,

47
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.040
come on and then just I'd get to go get ice cream or something.

48
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.650
Just Africa take me out.

49
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.390
Cause we were like going through like a one museum that was really boring.

50
00:02:32.391 --> 00:02:35.510
I can't remember. It was as a kid because she was the big museum in New York.

51
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.800
Now the Smithsonian was pretty cool.

52
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.060
Cause that was like loads of exhibits and stuff.

53
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.590
There's some other museum they took us to, which was like,

54
00:02:39.591 --> 00:02:43.730
maybe it was like the some CIA thing that was like books. And I was like,

55
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.710
I have no interest in this. I, but I remember I had no interest. They just like,

56
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.900
let us go around times square on our own [inaudible] that.

57
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.850
<v 1>Could have gone horrendously. Yeah.</v>

58
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.160
<v 0>Yeah. Like, like time square. Like.</v>

59
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.910
<v 2>I'm not even.</v>

60
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.300
<v 0>I wouldn't let my 60 door. I don't even feel it.</v>

61
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.440
<v 1>During the day in times square little at a night. I didn't feel safe. As,</v>

62
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.920
as an adult there let alone like a 16 year old kid.

63
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.740
And I remember this funny.

64
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.760
<v 0>One of the kids came back, right. I need to punch a CDs. And we were like,</v>

65
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.280
why do you have CDs? He's like, Oh, well, uh,

66
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.300
the guys kept coming up to me and telling me if I wanted to hear them spit.

67
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.570
So I kept having to buy them for $5. And I was like,

68
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.910
you know that the dudes carts you're like, yo, he's my mix tape.

69
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.530
<v 2>He was paying every time for everyone that came up to him.</v>

70
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.980
So he's just all of these like, mixed sex.

71
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.210
<v 0>I don't remember what I did. I think I just went around all the stores.</v>

72
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.100
You'd looked at it and be like, wow, it's just so strange.

73
00:03:44.101 --> 00:03:46.050
It would go in like M and M world and be like, wow,

74
00:03:46.051 --> 00:03:50.800
I can't afford any of it because it would be like $10 for a pack of M and M.

75
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.890
So I'm like, wow, I'm really broke. Huh?

76
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.110
My parents really didn't give me M and M's

77
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.340
I remember as well I'll hotel. Right. They put us in, like,

78
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.710
I think it was like the sun in, what is that called?

79
00:04:01.711 --> 00:04:03.930
It's like the comfort in or something. That's what it's called.

80
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.740
The sun got like a son Logan. Yeah.

81
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.430
And I remember we were all baffled because the only thing they had for breakfast

82
00:04:11.431 --> 00:04:15.960
was like burgers. That could be microwave. And it was disgusting.

83
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.280
We were all like, yeah. American food. We ate it with like, Oh, American food.

84
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.470
<v 1>It's like some white castle. Yeah.</v>

85
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.350
<v 0>It was gross. Um, I remember as well that, uh,</v>

86
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.100
we had to get the bus everywhere and it was just the worst because they tried to

87
00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:33.210
fit. Like they, they use public buses like private coaches.

88
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.000
<v 1>Talking the more I'm realizing why,</v>

89
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.490
who decided to go on a school trip to New York.

90
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.410
<v 0>I think it was what must have been one teacher that really.</v>

91
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.470
<v 1>It mentioned this that they do.</v>

92
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.940
<v 0>So we would go on like the public buses,</v>

93
00:04:44.941 --> 00:04:48.480
like the whole like 40 kids would go on a normal public bus.

94
00:04:48.481 --> 00:04:51.210
It was already full it's terrifying. And then all the,

95
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.630
all the dudes were like topless on the bus. And we were like, Oh God, Oh God,

96
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.780
I'm in danger. And then when the teachers would all go to bed,

97
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.820
all the kids just went out at night. And we went in because we were obviously,

98
00:05:02.821 --> 00:05:04.320
we were like not a rich school at all.

99
00:05:04.321 --> 00:05:06.750
So like the really sketchy part of New York.

100
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.910
<v 1>But you're rich enough to go to New York though.</v>

101
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.201
<v 0>Not really. It was,</v>

102
00:05:10.201 --> 00:05:13.950
I remember the whole trip for like four or five days with flights and five

103
00:05:13.951 --> 00:05:18.810
hotels was like 800 pounds and everything was taken for like.

104
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.903
<v 1>I guess.</v>

105
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.110
<v 0>Very budget, very budget. So the hotels we stayed in, what? Life?</v>

106
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.040
Not good at all.

107
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.223
<v 1>Like in the ghetto.</v>

108
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.220
<v 0>They were like, Halla. Imagine it you've got like 40 just like white school.</v>

109
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.380
<v 2>Kids that have no idea what's going on. But.</v>

110
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.260
<v 0>They break out at night and I'm like, I get it. But it's like.</v>

111
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.630
<v 1>Oh God, you guys are like Harlem or something.</v>

112
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.060
<v 0>I can't remember where we were, but we were very far away.</v>

113
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.360
It was at a 40 minute bus journey into town that could have been anywhere

114
00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:47.550
sketchy. I think we were like Queens.

115
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.460
Maybe we might've been around somewhere like that. It was definitely.

116
00:05:50.461 --> 00:05:53.880
I remember that. I remember having these cars,

117
00:05:53.881 --> 00:05:56.880
you would see on the movies that New York was like, yeah, man. It's bustling.

118
00:05:56.881 --> 00:05:59.690
It's yeah. I was like, why is where we're staying?

119
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.110
Everything is boarded up and dirty. What's up with that?

120
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.070
<v 1>Hustling bustling is like two blocks and men.</v>

121
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.350
<v 0>Well, I, I distinctly remember.</v>

122
00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.190
I really didn't like New York and I liked DC because when we went to DC,

123
00:06:12.191 --> 00:06:14.100
it was really nice. And I remember that,

124
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.570
cause I was just scared when we went to New York.

125
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.390
<v 1>That was, that was mine. First impression going to New York as well.</v>

126
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.040
I also went when I was a bit older. So I was like 20.

127
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.880
<v 0>I feel like when you're 60 and 22, that way you see the waters completely.</v>

128
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.850
<v 1>Yeah. I don't know. I still have this, like, you know, the, the,</v>

129
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.440
the American film image of New York. And I was,

130
00:06:35.441 --> 00:06:37.480
I remember my first time going there. I remember thinking, man,

131
00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:41.020
there's a lot of street corners that I've never seen in any films that look

132
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.070
pretty dodgy.

133
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.650
<v 0>As well. Like Spider-Man's parents got killed.</v>

134
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.860
<v 1>That's the thing. When I went to New York, like four or five years ago,</v>

135
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:52.390
like it was really good. If as long as your neck was like above like landscape,

136
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.460
right. It's just like, wow, these buildings look really good.

137
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.450
And the moment you look down and just like, Oh, that's a lot of trash.

138
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.820
There is that. That was my first impression.

139
00:07:00.821 --> 00:07:05.050
There is a lot of trash that just has never, it has never appeared on,

140
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.100
like there was no trash on this corner that is like reaching like traffic

141
00:07:09.101 --> 00:07:11.860
lights, like my God go to Chinatown for the first time

142
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.340
don't hit there for the smell differently.

143
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.840
<v 0>This is episode 33 where we clown on America.</v>
