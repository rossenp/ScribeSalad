WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.170
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, we've locked down.</v>

2
00:00:01.171 --> 00:00:05.920
There's not so much new I can be doing so recently I had this,

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.220
um, at a wake up one day and I was just like, Oh,

4
00:00:10.221 --> 00:00:12.120
I should get back into fake go. No.

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.370
<v 1>No, I saw you taking a and I was just like, no, no, no, no. It's,</v>

6
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.250
it's like watching, it's like watching a friend start a new drug.

7
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.590
You know what I mean? It's like, no, please stop.

8
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.790
It's just seeing your mate like just relapse. And he's like, no, no,

9
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:28.850
you were 10 weeks ago.

10
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.080
<v 0>Man. Come on. I mean, I'm kind of the same way. Like I, uh,</v>

11
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.500
I did something that I haven't done in literal years,

12
00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:39.350
which is by an arrogance, like a Japanese name.

13
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.540
<v 1>Ooh. I am brand new.</v>

14
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.150
<v 0>Came out arrogant. So, because I was in our Calibre a while back,</v>

15
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.240
um, doing some shopping for a video and uh,

16
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.400
and I was walking parceling Mellon books, which is like, you know,

17
00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:55.730
where they sold a little like Dogen's and stuff and out the front. Okay.

18
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.930
So basically say out the front,

19
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.110
they have like a bunch of signs for like new games that come out. Right.

20
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.620
And every now and then they'll also show some signs for like arrogance.

21
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.030
All right. Cause that's where they sell it.

22
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.420
And there was one where I was just like, that actually looks really cool.

23
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:09.770
Like I didn't actually know it was an arrogant.

24
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:12.680
I thought it was like a standard JPG or whatever, but I was like,

25
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.450
that actually kind of looks cool. So I looked it up,

26
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.460
found out it's an arrogance by Alice soft. And I was like, wow, Alice soft,

27
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.690
actually just like click baited me into thinking that this was like a legitimate

28
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.950
JL Fiji when it's just.

29
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.560
<v 1>With J LPG elements in it. So I was like, all right, you know what? I'll buy it.</v>

30
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.240
I'll buy it. It's locked down. I can't really go out anywhere. And I haven't.

31
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.250
<v 0>And played an arrogance so many years. it. I'll do it. Played it. And uh,</v>

32
00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:42.020
that's kind of all I've been doing for the past three days.

33
00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:46.340
Really trying to give context to Connor about what Alice soft has done. Yeah.

34
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.880
<v 1>I don't know if there's.</v>

35
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.480
<v 0>Any games like that, of famous outside of Japan.</v>

36
00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:56.660
That also basically Ellis soft is like one of the oldest,

37
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.490
I guess like most well-known in the era gay womb. Um, there's like illusion,

38
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.530
like Alice soft, um, what? A leaf, a leaf.

39
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.370
Yeah. You train them and poke them. Uh, you know,

40
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.310
Maple's another maker. Favorite Pokemon card. Maple lumber sugar is another one.

41
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.303
There's like.

42
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.410
<v 1>Basically it's like, it's, it's.</v>

43
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.680
<v 0>Basically just like an OJI, uh, arrogant developer.</v>

44
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.400
And they came up with a new game that looks completely different to anything

45
00:02:25.401 --> 00:02:29.240
that they've done. So I played a few like Ellis soft games back in my shoe.

46
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:30.643
What the do you do?

47
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.700
American explained to me it's a visual novel visual novel with porn.

48
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.760
<v 1>Jack. Awful. If it's good,</v>

49
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.243
Connor's like, wait, how can you.

50
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.370
<v 0>How's that work? So if it's good, you're like,</v>

51
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.050
basically think of it as it's like perfectly halfway between jacking off to a

52
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.640
Dogan and jacking off to a hammer.

53
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.550
I can't imagine how the latter or the former feels.

54
00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:59.890
So basically it's like jacking off to a [inaudible] but the audio from the

55
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.090
hand-tight play. Okay. Yeah. So there's voice acting and the sound effects.

56
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.560
So it's dubbed [inaudible] that can also be autoplayed. Yeah.

57
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.700
<v 2>You're playing this story game and you might say you just beat one out and then</v>

58
00:03:14.701 --> 00:03:17.100
you just carry on. Yeah. Yeah.

59
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.220
I there for like 30 seconds after I'm done.

60
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.410
And I've just looked at discussed of what I've been testing.

61
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.410
Like I might I'm like, turn that off.

62
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.680
How well with all the milk ends while you've been watching, I am,

63
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.130
I will be discussed. The topic is right after it. You are in life,

64
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.990
like a heightened state of like, you're,

65
00:03:36.991 --> 00:03:39.720
you're basically like a monk for 30 seconds where you're like,

66
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.610
I will never have sex ever. I'm like, turn the. You get post, not regret.

67
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.010
Oh, a hundred percent every time, every time.

68
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.460
And then I'm like a week with porn.

69
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.770
If I could abandoned porn, I would, you know what I mean? Like, yeah. I would,

70
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.180
if I, if every guy says,

71
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.850
if you could say you just never need to ever again, I'd be like, sure. Why not?

72
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.660
Well, let's try it. Let's see how it goes. I love the completed. No,

73
00:04:06.661 --> 00:04:11.130
not the vendor. No, I've never attempted it. Well, it sounds like you'll,

74
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.730
you're wanting to attempt to right now does end up getting like a wet dream

75
00:04:14.731 --> 00:04:18.810
eventually. Right? Like, that'll happen. Well, if you leave it for a month,

76
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.030
yeah. When was the last time you didn't check off for a month? I will never,

77
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.660
but that's because, but that's because I'm not going to.

78
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.970
<v 0>Spew being like, I can live without point.</v>

79
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.510
<v 2>Like no, no, no. I want a one point. No, I want to, I want to live without it.</v>

80
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.050
I don't want to be, I just find out this is,

81
00:04:37.051 --> 00:04:39.060
this is the literally I don't want to be horny.

82
00:04:39.061 --> 00:04:42.000
I want it like I've ever seen in real life.

83
00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:44.650
I hate being distracted from what I'm trying to do. And just,

84
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.700
I look at that meme and I'm just like, I want both really.

85
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.440
I want to be horny and happy. So you just, you know, you just say you see this.

86
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.960
<v 0>As like a distraction from your optimized.</v>

87
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.830
<v 2>Life. Optimized lifestyle is being ruined by this.</v>

88
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.090
Oh my God.

89
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.110
I can never hear the word optimized after this podcast.

90
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.100
You're you're playing this game. You know, it's a game.

91
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.130
How are we going to game? It's reading, it's tricking you in a Jackal.

92
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.930
<v 0>This Alyse soft one has like full on J RPG elements as well.</v>

93
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.650
So you're like you're in the middle of a battle and you're trying to Jack off.

94
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.480
No, no, no, no. So the RPG elements. Okay. So think of it. Okay. This is,

95
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.140
I hate the fact that I'm using this as an example, think of persona.

96
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.380
<v 2>Oh God, here we go.</v>

97
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.070
<v 0>Persona. The persona games are, in my opinion,</v>

98
00:05:35.071 --> 00:05:39.660
persona games are the perfect blend of visual novel and Jay

99
00:05:39.661 --> 00:05:44.100
RPG where like they've somehow managed to make two like elements of two

100
00:05:44.101 --> 00:05:47.820
completely different styles of games and mix it perfectly. Right. So in persona,

101
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.830
the J RPG elements are most often than not completely separated from the actual

102
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.460
visual novel elements. Right? In persona. Yeah. In persona.

103
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.950
Whereas visual novel of quake.

104
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:03.890
I dunno if I just fell small Jake, well, that's pretty this

105
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.020
persona personas persona, right? Like the,

106
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.970
you have the visual novel elements and then you have the J in between the yeah.

107
00:06:11.971 --> 00:06:14.890
Yeah. So like, you know, you'd have like, you go through a dungeon or whatever,

108
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.650
and then, you know, once, once you complete that dungeon,

109
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.880
then it goes into the visual level as you call it. I mean,

110
00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:25.540
I would argue that the GRPC elements fill up for you as well, but regardless.

111
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.560
Right. So, you know,

112
00:06:26.561 --> 00:06:29.500
you have like the story elements and you have like the actual like gameplay

113
00:06:29.501 --> 00:06:32.640
elements, right? Yeah. Whereas in this era gay, the,

114
00:06:32.641 --> 00:06:37.030
the sex scenes time start to happen during only the visual novel elements.

115
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.820
Hmm. Okay. So, so the,

116
00:06:39.821 --> 00:06:43.380
the vision of elements of the sex scenes and the gameplay stuff breaks up.

117
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.090
<v 1>So like a standard Silicon.</v>

118
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:47.470
<v 0>Standard error,</v>

119
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.340
like a standard irrigate that doesn't have JFE har it's basically just a visual

120
00:06:51.341 --> 00:06:54.760
novel with sex scenes put into it. Yeah. Right.

121
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.370
So it kind of interferes with the story with this one.

122
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.090
It's just that separately. It has a J RPG portion as well.

123
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.180
<v 2>You mean like you battle, like, what are you doing this? Like what?</v>

124
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.300
I'm confused, what are you doing? What the else do you do in a J LPG?

125
00:07:07.301 --> 00:07:08.770
So you're just, it's just a dead,

126
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.400
a normal J RPG game where you're going around battling monsters leveling off.

127
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.980
And then it cuts to like a visual novel.

128
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.920
<v 0>Yeah. Who comes up with that?</v>

129
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:21.160
<v 1>I'm.</v>

130
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.100
<v 0>Looking at this on like on a slide. I can literally hear the gears,</v>

131
00:07:24.101 --> 00:07:28.210
like turning in his head and it's just not computing. It's just like, wait,

132
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.290
no, like they're not, they're not coming to Gemma. They're just stuck.

133
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.960
<v 2>No, I was just like, this sounds to me, right?</v>

134
00:07:34.961 --> 00:07:38.260
This is the equivalent of being like, so it's a food tray that jacks you off.

135
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.540
It's like, I don't want those two things going near each other.

136
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:44.290
What are you talking about? Like those two elements, the JLP game,

137
00:07:44.291 --> 00:07:46.150
and then just a visual novel with Paul in it.

138
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.310
I like just two elements that just shouldn't be involved at all. Why not? Why,

139
00:07:50.311 --> 00:07:51.880
why would, why wouldn't you want it?

140
00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.120
<v 1>[Inaudible] don't look like.</v>

141
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:59.650
<v 0>Talking about it as if like there's the visual novel, like storytelling, pot,</v>

142
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:00.580
and then there's the sexy.

143
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.840
<v 1>Immediately. And then immediately there's a battle. That's not how it works.</v>

144
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:06.303
What, how does it work?

145
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.880
<v 0>It, it works as if like there's the storytelling element,</v>

146
00:08:09.881 --> 00:08:13.360
the visual novel element. And in the middle, there is a sexy.

147
00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:15.850
So it's sandwiched between the visual novel elements.

148
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.390
<v 2>Visual novel elements where they're telling a story and there's porn in the</v>

149
00:08:19.391 --> 00:08:23.110
middle. And then it just cuts to when it, when the dumb with the talking,

150
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.770
it just goes to a normal deadass game. Yeah. What,

151
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.670
why does this sound good to you? Am I insane? This sounds awful.

152
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:31.533
It sounds great.

153
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.180
<v 1>Awesome. You just play devil's advocate.</v>

154
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:36.931
<v 0>I mean, I've, I,</v>

155
00:08:36.931 --> 00:08:41.430
I say this as someone who has also played Aero gaze before this there's

156
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.640
something, there's something about like hen Thai games and arrow gays,

157
00:08:45.641 --> 00:08:49.360
where the sex scenes feel like this.

158
00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:52.480
There's something different about feeling like you've earned it.

159
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.000
<v 1>A percent, a hundred percent agree.</v>

160
00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.830
It is like you could have the most mediocre sex scene,

161
00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.230
but you feel like you've earned that sentence.

162
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:04.940
And I'm also in this game because like,

163
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:08.600
you can unlock certain sex scenes depending on what you do in the JPG.

164
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:13.100
You'd like a person who watches a hand tie. I don't want an X-Box achievement.

165
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:14.660
I want to hand tight sheep. And you know what?

166
00:09:14.661 --> 00:09:19.610
I'm a person who watches a hand-tight and skip straight to 15

167
00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.030
or 20 minutes or not know. What's.

168
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.900
<v 2>That's all for the story in hand tag.</v>

169
00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:29.000
But I don't want to sit there and read a book and then Jack off into the

170
00:09:29.001 --> 00:09:32.690
book and then wipe the, come off my hand and go around my RPG world,

171
00:09:32.691 --> 00:09:35.630
leveling up my character. Right. I don't want to deal with light. Look,

172
00:09:35.631 --> 00:09:37.400
don't get me wrong. Like.

173
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:41.000
<v 1>I'm just say, man, this is not the type of key for anybody. This isn't,</v>

174
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.350
this isn't like. I completely understand that. The stuff I liked.

175
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.280
<v 2>In hindsight is pretty. Yeah. This is like, you know what I said,</v>

176
00:09:49.281 --> 00:09:53.060
I don't eat where you. Right. This is like beating the. But you're sleeping.

177
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.900
Like, this is like, this is so. Like this shouldn't be a combination of thing.

178
00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:01.640
Like only Japan would make something like this because it's just so stupidly

179
00:10:01.641 --> 00:10:05.600
like, like this shouldn't exist. Just not sure. Like look at honeypot Paul.

180
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.710
<v 1>That was, that was made by Americans. like honeypot by Connie Pope.</v>

181
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.420
I enjoy honeypot because it's literally what I just made by

182
00:10:14.421 --> 00:10:16.550
American. Because like, I, for example.

183
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.460
<v 2>But Bejeweled or some wasn't that game. Like he was one of those, yeah,</v>

184
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:21.500
it was like, it was like a puzzle game.

185
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:25.940
<v 1>But I also gave him that a Jack off too. But then under, because the thing is,</v>

186
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.970
the thing is it's like Jackie off to a jigsaw puzzle.

187
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.190
<v 2>Being like, Oh, it's making porn. The.</v>

188
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.930
<v 1>Pieces of making a poem because the thing is, the thing is right.</v>

189
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.480
You have this gameplay loop, right? You have this gameplay loop, but unlike you,

190
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.700
I need a reward for playing this game.

191
00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.930
I need a reward for playing this game.

192
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:49.340
I don't Jack off to X-Box it's most of the time to X-Box achievements either.

193
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:53.060
Well, most of the time it has to be story most of the time.

194
00:10:53.061 --> 00:10:55.580
That's why I play games. If I have a gameplay loop,

195
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.550
you can have the best gameplay loop of all time.

196
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.540
If there's no motivation for me to play it, then I'm just going to not play it.

197
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.180
I don't give a about most games that don't have a story. Cause it's like,

198
00:11:05.181 --> 00:11:06.830
what's the, what am I, why am I playing this? Yeah.

199
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.600
There's there are so many games that I, yeah.

200
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.920
<v 2>I agree again. I can totally agree with that, but why is that poem in it?</v>

201
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.940
<v 1>Because that's the reward you get for playing the game because I'm sorry.</v>

202
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.480
You find feeling a little horny. Sometimes I just can't imagine holding.

203
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:25.010
<v 2>Xbox controller and then just put it down, get the tissue box.</v>

204
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:28.850
<v 1>Like, say for example, like a game like frozen.</v>

205
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.600
<v 2>The degeneracy should not be reached. My first I gave him like dead cells.</v>

206
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:36.920
<v 1>Which I heard, which I, which I played and I played it for what, five minutes.</v>

207
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.050
And I thought this was a really good game.

208
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.270
And then I got bored for five minutes. Cause I was like,

209
00:11:41.271 --> 00:11:42.200
why am I playing this game?

210
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.450
There's no motivation for you to actually play through levels.

211
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:48.320
It's nice gameplay loop. Same with something like Celeste plus. Amazing.

212
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.610
This is an amazing game.

213
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.260
I went through one level when I got bored because I really couldn't care the

214
00:11:53.261 --> 00:11:58.000
story. It's so good. But that's the thing.

215
00:11:58.001 --> 00:12:02.380
If it had a reward for me to complete the level that I would have played through

216
00:12:02.381 --> 00:12:06.340
it, then there needs to be some kind of work on is saying, is that

217
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:17.680
[inaudible] if every time like if every time I completed a level of Celeste,

218
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:18.543
there was a hint.

219
00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.480
<v 2>Or something like that. You literally just want like,</v>

220
00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.290
God wants to S to have like a beat a level. And then the porn hub music started.

221
00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:26.880
That's what God wants.

222
00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:31.290
<v 1>Yes. I want that. Imagine you guys are too comfortable. Imagine,</v>

223
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:36.150
imagine an IRO gay with something on the gameplay level of dead cells or

224
00:12:36.151 --> 00:12:39.420
Celeste or something along those lines. Masterpiece. Mike,

225
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:44.550
I'm just imagining that right now. That would be, uh, that would be a mask.

226
00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.650
That would be amazing because like, you know,

227
00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:51.600
every time you finish a level of solace, you have such light yes. Like moments,

228
00:12:51.601 --> 00:12:53.640
right? It's like, yes, I, I went through that.

229
00:12:53.641 --> 00:12:58.350
I died hundreds and hundreds of times. And now here is my reward.

230
00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.080
Hell yet? That is going to be the best Jack off. You'll ever have to,

231
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.490
to saying, make Celeste porn.

232
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.350
[inaudible] we don't want to loot the character.

233
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.300
That's not what we're talking about.

234
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:16.200
If we had a gameplay loop of something like Celeste or something on that level,

235
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:20.040
and then we had, we had it. Hence my God,

236
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.580
that is improving upon perfection. You people have not,

237
00:13:23.581 --> 00:13:28.410
how has crowdfund this? I'm making these, I am making this.

238
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.790
I am going to fund some money right now. Some money I will make it happen.

239
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.930
<v 2>It's animals.</v>

240
00:13:33.931 --> 00:13:38.790
Like you have the reason why we have like Minecraft sex scenes.

241
00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:42.780
Like this is the prop you guys would want to put porn and everything.

242
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:45.960
Have you seen the Minecraft porn on YouTube at all? Some of us kind of.

243
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:49.043
<v 1>Joey.</v>

244
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.210
<v 2>She's a level in sorry. Even the levels in mind,</v>

245
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.640
Joe finishes getting some diamonds in Minecraft.

246
00:13:53.641 --> 00:13:56.880
Just swapped over to the next tab and start playing Minecraft.

247
00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.280
<v 1>Oh dude. Do you know how hard it is to get diamonds in Minecraft?</v>

248
00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:00.143
That's like a great.

249
00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:03.240
<v 2>Oh it's.</v>

250
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:08.460
<v 1>I can say that publicly because I know I'm not the only one who genuinely thinks</v>

251
00:14:08.461 --> 00:14:12.630
that the fact that Minecraft point even exists means that I.

252
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.910
<v 2>Am not. You're saying you like Minecraft porn. No.</v>

253
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:19.530
<v 1>I'm not saying I have a problem with it. No, I mean, I don't care what this is.</v>

254
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:20.840
It's like a kid's game.

255
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.970
I've uh, this, this podcast has been a weird.

256
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.740
<v 2>One. I just think it's sad, right?</v>

257
00:14:28.741 --> 00:14:32.940
That there are kids out there who legitimately like, are curious about porn.

258
00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:37.920
And the first thing they think is my two loves Stephen Minecraft.

259
00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:42.090
I would like to see if they did that to him because it's only kids watching

260
00:14:42.091 --> 00:14:44.910
these things. Right? Cause now we're talking Jack often, Steve,

261
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.800
Steve blocks something. You know what I mean? No, Jerry, come on,

262
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.010
come on. I'm not saying I, but I think, I think.

263
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.830
<v 1>You underestimate some like adults willpower. Okay.</v>

264
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:57.740
I have jacked off to Minecraft. No, no.

265
00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:02.120
I've this is the first I've ever heard of Minecraft porn on this.

266
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:06.800
You've never seen it. I've never seen it. Describe it to me please. I mean,

267
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.940
we just kind of have to show you this. You need to describe it to me.

268
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.140
<v 2>In like four or five years ago. Come on.</v>

269
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:14.560
Wishing she'd been made the video about it,

270
00:15:14.561 --> 00:15:18.250
but there was actually like so much like full on traditional pornos.

271
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.570
Cause I've made in Minecraft.

272
00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:23.470
<v 1>You first mentioned that. I thought, okay, we're just being sarcastic.</v>

273
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.430
<v 2>There's like, uh, what's his name? Captain sparkles. Right? The one,</v>

274
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.010
it was like Minecraft animations. Yeah. Basically imagine that.

275
00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.370
But it would literally be like a porno situation where it was like,

276
00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:34.540
someone would be like, Oh.

277
00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.060
<v 1>It's like a high quality, like Minecraft</v>

278
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.780
[inaudible] that was like, Steve, like Rams, please say, sorry. No, no, no.

279
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:47.230
Like Steve, like a creeper or something or something. And the creeper is like.

280
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.540
All right. Yeah. This is legit. This is actually, we will show you.

281
00:15:52.541 --> 00:15:53.374
This is the path.

282
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.270
<v 2>Hold back. Right?</v>

283
00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.920
If you let your creative juices run wild on projects like Joey wants to do with

284
00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.980
all of the. This is what happens. And we don't need this.

285
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.040
We don't need this. I don't know.

286
00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:09.190
<v 1>No don't get me wrong. We don't need it. No, that's the thing. Right?</v>

287
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.110
People want it? No, no, no.

288
00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.480
It doesn't matter what people want people there to sell for what they want.

289
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.990
I don't know if it's worth, I don't know if it's worse.

290
00:16:16.991 --> 00:16:21.160
What I just imagined in my mind from you describing it or actually watching the

291
00:16:21.161 --> 00:16:24.700
actual thing. We'll show you afterwards. And I don't know.

292
00:16:24.701 --> 00:16:27.040
Maybe just we can add a clip of like gut reaction.

293
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.500
<v 2>When we're done with the episode. We'll leave the cameras rolling.</v>

294
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:35.290
<v 1>Yeah. Just like this is a post, right? It's literally like.</v>

295
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.760
<v 2>It can only be kids watching it. Yeah. Right.</v>

296
00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:39.550
<v 1>So disturbing that it's just funny.</v>

297
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.720
<v 2>Well, I mean, it's funny to us, but obviously I'm sure.</v>

298
00:16:42.721 --> 00:16:45.550
I'm sure the kid watching is pretty good.

299
00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:47.320
<v 1>Have we reached that age?</v>

300
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.770
Is this what our parents felt when they walked in and saw us like Jackie and elf

301
00:16:50.771 --> 00:16:54.850
to animated? How is this how they felt now? I mean,

302
00:16:54.851 --> 00:16:59.770
I'll never forget the look. My parents gave me. Whoa, wait.

303
00:16:59.771 --> 00:17:01.570
You've never had like your parents like walking on you Jack.

304
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.570
<v 2>No, I've hit it very well if they have really again, I remember that.</v>

305
00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.920
That was my staff's wood Creek.

306
00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:08.190
<v 1>Oh yeah. That's right. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.</v>

307
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.140
Your parents walked in on you with my dad walked in on me once.

308
