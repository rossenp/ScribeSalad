1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.391
<v 0>Have you,</v>

2
00:00:00.391 --> 00:00:03.300
have you ever been working up to the deadline where you've been working on the

3
00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:05.510
show and it's, it's been airing.

4
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.153
<v 1>[Inaudible] Oh.</v>

5
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.040
<v 2>Sinkers, uh, season three. I was doing my Ginga, so yeah,</v>

6
00:00:16.041 --> 00:00:19.850
again guides a second step of the animation and, uh.

7
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.550
<v 1>What does getting go involve? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.</v>

8
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.310
<v 0>Kinda knows nothing about salvation. So we're going to break it down.</v>

9
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.980
<v 2>For now. Our explains the process of the fabrication of Ganga. Okay.</v>

10
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.490
So you have the County mentor me. Um, um,

11
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.900
I received an offer of work by Twitter or by mail or Twitter sometimes

12
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.580
free too, because a lot of, uh, assistant production, uh,

13
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.850
looking for animators on Twitter. And so for Japan,

14
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.590
most of the Japanese animator, they use Twitter has a, uh, portfolio,

15
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:52.490
uh.

16
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.100
<v 1>Right. Tons of DM, right? Yeah. That makes sense.</v>

17
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.150
<v 2>And, uh, so hi, uh, I'm uh,</v>

18
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.050
I'm from this to ju I have this project, uh, the schedule is that,

19
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.980
do you want to work on it? So I look my schedule if it's okay.

20
00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:11.270
If it's good match. Yeah, sure. Okay. Let's let's uh, put a,

21
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.280
uh, a date for the meeting, do the meetings. So, okay. This date.

22
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.730
So I go to the schedule, meet at the, uh,

23
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.790
the jerk JP side and assistant production,

24
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:26.480
who I send mails and we are doing, uh,

25
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.170
the meeting for the sequence I have choose. At first,

26
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.850
the day you send me a storyboard,

27
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.050
a storyboard is a little comic technical.

28
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.430
Camika about a rough.

29
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.170
<v 1>Outline of the.</v>

30
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.600
<v 2>Weeds are coming, our walks a technical notes. Right. And I choose my sequence.</v>

31
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.860
A sequence can be just like three Curt certificates,

32
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.550
19 cats. What, what, what's a cart cut.

33
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.770
<v 0>Like one scene, like one continuous scene below. I see the scene changes. So,</v>

34
00:01:57.771 --> 00:02:01.460
you know, when in live action, when you film something and then the camera cuts,

35
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.320
obviously in animation that you don't have an entire scene that you cut out of

36
00:02:06.321 --> 00:02:08.600
that's preplanned. Right. Right. That makes sense. Okay.

37
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.170
<v 2>And so one chin can be one second or 10,</v>

38
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.060
second 30 seconds is depends. Right. And if there is a lot of seconds,

39
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.190
it's more walks ride. Right. Naturally. And so like, Alexa,

40
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.580
take an example. Okay. We choose district once it's 10 kids.

41
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.310
And so I go to the meeting, so reaching for,

42
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.590
with the director and he going to explain me how he see,

43
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.650
uh, how he wants those 10 cuts make. Okay. Right. And he spanked me.

44
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.820
Yeah. For this skirt, I would like a rough animation,

45
00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:48.590
a more action, like a form of West coast, or we'll set, uh.

46
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.800
<v 1>Soccer, soccer goes like the Western slang word for like,</v>

47
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.160
so the word soccer in Western world is.

48
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.810
<v 0>Completely different to what soccer in Japanese actually is. Yeah. So in,</v>

49
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:08.880
so in the anime community, we refer to soccer as good animation. Right?

50
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.750
Lots of frames, lots of flashy animation,

51
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:15.220
but in Japanese soccer guard just means frames. You.

52
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.750
<v 2>Look into Kanji, Sacco, make.</v>

53
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.200
<v 1>Picture. Yeah. So it's kind of become like a buzz word. Yeah.</v>

54
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.490
Right. Right. Makes sense. If you say anime in Japan

55
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.690
and your mission, but if you say any man in a.

56
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.880
<v 2>West, it's just the Japanese.</v>

57
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.540
<v 0>Japanese on it. So in Japan, monsters Inc. Is technically an animal.</v>

58
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.310
<v 1>Yes. I love my enemy list. Hello. Hello.</v>

59
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.850
<v 0>Wait. So you had like 10 cuts on my hero. Academia.</v>

60
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.520
<v 1>Yeah. And different types of animation.</v>

61
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.000
<v 2>Uh, different types of animations. Sometimes just the talkings. Yeah.</v>

62
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.870
Little actings and sometimes some, uh, action kits.

63
00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.060
And so I do the, the meeting with the director, so it takes like 30 minutes,

64
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.370
uh, of the, so I have to do the first step. It's the layout. Yeah.

65
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.630
So I'm going to.

66
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.930
<v 1>You're telling me words and I have no idea what the layout is. Uh.</v>

67
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.470
<v 2>I see you in one scene and I have to draw</v>

68
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.340
the background with the character on it and,

69
00:04:23.341 --> 00:04:27.920
or the movement of the character, just rough, very rough. They were rough.

70
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.090
And also if there is a Camero walks, I have to add it. Right. And,

71
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.360
uh, all of put the timing of this kits.

72
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.160
<v 0>Oh, wow. Okay. So it's basically like, it's, it's basically like the storyboard,</v>

73
00:04:41.161 --> 00:04:42.600
but just a bit more.

74
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.350
<v 1>We're fine. We're fine. It's fine.</v>

75
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.870
<v 2>She, a character, what movement he will do, just.</v>

76
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.000
<v 0>Like when you see like there's outlines, sketches.</v>

77
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.543
<v 1>Like that.</v>

78
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.670
<v 2>And that's it. You don't need to push it to the most.</v>

79
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.670
So you have to watch your drawings of it.

80
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.080
You have to know a bit or the, what the character is armor or clot.

81
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.800
Exactly. And when you finished that, you saw it,

82
00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:12.300
you send it back to the director. [inaudible] will check it, uh,

83
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.900
at some, uh, corruption. All the armies are true, low,

84
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.880
more higher expression, not sad, more angry. Uh,

85
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.320
and after those correction, by the director, it's we go to the second.

86
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.910
So, uh, [inaudible] animation director. Okay. Okay.

87
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.560
And the animation director, we put it at your drawings more in model.

88
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.530
So if you have C good drawing,

89
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.160
it's because of the SAC can have putter or his get on it because the second in

90
00:05:44.161 --> 00:05:46.710
one episodes there is at least one or two and he,

91
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.620
they have to check the 150 cuts.

92
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.300
<v 0>Oh, wow. So,</v>

93
00:05:51.301 --> 00:05:55.290
so they basically make sure that the characters kind of look the same and

94
00:05:55.291 --> 00:05:57.950
consistent throughout in fact, uh, the.

95
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.210
<v 2>Animators just to draw a rough diamond.</v>

96
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.980
And if this diamond is good, Cory T after the second can Polish it.

97
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:08.423
<v 1>Right.</v>

98
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.740
<v 0>So like how many, like, say for like my hero academia,</v>

99
00:06:11.741 --> 00:06:13.060
like an episode of my hair, academia,

100
00:06:13.061 --> 00:06:16.990
like how many different animators would be working on like one episode,

101
00:06:16.991 --> 00:06:21.130
for instance, like individual animals seem, uh, on average.

102
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.960
<v 2>An average, uh, uh, at least 10 nanometers. It would be good if you bet, uh,</v>

103
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.910
you can see on the credit, right? How many animators Ganga into Potkin gap,

104
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.230
right? Uh, how many is that?

105
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.120
You made some time you have the 1500 meters or sometime you have

106
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.340
what is called one man army.

107
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.820
<v 1>Just one guy, one guy. Wow. Never done that. Oh, no, no,</v>

108
00:06:45.821 --> 00:06:48.460
no, actually I'm just a baby man.

109
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:51.000
I was going to say like.

110
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.350
<v 0>You have to be to do the Savio of an entire 24 minute episode. Yeah.</v>

111
00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.890
<v 2>Yeah. And the dusk guys are core monsters.</v>

112
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.270
<v 1>Yeah. Just like red light. Just destroy the risks like this</v>

113
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.633
very fast.

114
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:09.460
<v 2>You see,</v>

115
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.350
this is a Japanese animation when you see a veteran animator. Okay.

116
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.080
<v 1>Yeah, sure. You mentioned one guy doing it all.</v>

117
00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.240
<v 0>Like it's like that scene from Hunter, Hunter,</v>

118
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.290
where the guy returns from like being up in the mountains for like 10 years or

119
00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:24.124
something.

120
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:27.693
<v 1>Just returns.</v>

121
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.810
<v 0>Everyone has done. And everyone becomes his disciples.</v>

122
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:36.840
<v 2>They me like one day you can do it in one.</v>

123
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.590
<v 1>Some people have too much talent. Right.</v>

124
00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:47.410
<v 2>Also. I mean, I'm just, uh, I'm sorry. Two, one. Yeah. Right. And the guy,</v>

125
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.330
my senpai is like 31 years of experience in animation,

126
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.193
right?

127
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:54.700
<v 1>No, that's what Jim said, baby.</v>

128
00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.220
Five years in the anime industry is like nothing. It's nothing. Wow. Oh my God.

129
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.610
Well, we'll have, we'll have you back on in 20 years.
