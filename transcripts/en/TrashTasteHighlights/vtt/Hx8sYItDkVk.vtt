00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.150
<v 0>I mean for me, I feel like I haven't changed much.</v>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.570
Like my look apart from the only thing that's changed is the spikiness of my

3
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:08.410
hair. Over the years. You've calmed down.

4
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.190
You can tell the Gignac years by the younger,

5
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:14.430
I am like the more spikes in the hair. Yeah. There are,

6
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:18.180
you look at some of my first videos and I look like SaaS gay man and wondering,

7
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:18.650
right?

8
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.340
<v 1>Like how did you decide on that hair style? Cause that's like, that's a look.</v>

9
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.860
<v 0>You've had since you were young or no, I think, I can't remember.</v>

10
00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:32.540
I just remember, because I have like hair that's really easy to be spiked up.

11
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:32.871
Right.

12
00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:37.700
So I think ever since constitutes easy to spike up like light and

13
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.650
I mean like, could you spike up easily? If I, my hair, like,

14
00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:46.370
if I cut it short, I put a bit of water in it and it just like immediately,

15
00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:49.550
like naturally it's just like the anime character spice,

16
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.880
Asian hair has that to it. Cause like my hair is also like quite story.

17
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.980
So like if I put gel in it and it's just art for, I dunno, like yeah,

18
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.590
no, I get that. But like, then again, it's like,

19
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.200
just because your hair can do that doesn't mean you have to like.

20
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.350
<v 1>What's that? Okay. Was it inspired by anime? What is he inspired?</v>

21
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.490
He was inspired by.

22
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.370
<v 0>So many hairstyles.</v>

23
00:01:13.371 --> 00:01:17.300
I could pull off and I had no idea what the I was doing with my hair.

24
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.740
Therefore look, it,

25
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.890
it was the hairstyle that took the least amount of effort to do.

26
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.250
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.110
<v 0>That's not okay. It wasn't because like I said,</v>

28
00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:30.320
my hairstyle is just naturally spiky. So all I would need to do,

29
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.690
just put a bit of water, put a bit of gel and just go.

30
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.510
<v 1>No, because it was done.</v>

31
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.130
<v 0>It naturally like naturally went to that shape.</v>

32
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.680
<v 1>Naturally.</v>

33
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.640
<v 0>Sonic the head just woke up and I was Sonic. Like what can I say? No,</v>

34
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.850
because like I remember in some older videos, your hair is like,

35
00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:54.470
so it looked like a wig. That's like, that's how perfect the spike was.

36
00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:56.600
I was like, this man could pass off as like a sidekick.

37
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.470
<v 1>It was like, you'd been watching too many, like David Bowie concerts.</v>

38
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.590
I like that. I'm going to, I'm a mimic that basically that's what it looks like.

39
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.110
Yeah. I, I wasn't trying to mimic anything I had no, I just had like,

40
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.160
no idea what the. It.

41
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.380
<v 0>Was like some guy who was like trying to bring back like the eighties.</v>

42
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.620
<v 1>Glamour, because it's like, whatever the Mr. Adam,</v>

43
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.850
may you talk to you about that? It's so funny watching that and seeing God,

44
00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:22.850
just like with like this teenage hat, it's really sad.

45
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.950
I feel bad. But like, obviously I was like, ah, it's funny now.

46
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.620
<v 0>Like if you didn't know the context and you just saw the thumbnail,</v>

47
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.150
it looks like those like angsty.

48
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:33.793
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

49
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.630
it is totally air con it. Hair.

50
00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:40.700
It's like Sonic the hedgehog or you're talking about like,

51
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.850
you're talking about like occupy, like the most serious thing.

52
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.580
And you got like this Sonic hair. Know my child focus on it.

53
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.480
<v 0>Yeah, because I'm just talking about, yeah. This guy just like killing me,</v>

54
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.500
but bro, that hair that's, this man's hair has its own orbit.

55
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.380
Yes. Welcome to trash tastes where we are now.

56
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.040
Now we're trashing on each other's haircuts as, as good mates do what,

57
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:11.170
what are we doing? That's what constitutes as a mate, right? Like,

58
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.060
can you really call your mate a mate?

59
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:16.630
If they don't make fun of you after a haircut? Okay. Like, did you read,

60
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.410
did you,

61
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.980
what age did you reach where you actually like paid attention and gave a about

62
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:24.190
what you looked like? Because I was like really late.

63
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.940
The reason I looked like that was because I didn't really give, it gave,

64
00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:31.420
give a about what I looked like until I got to like my first,

65
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:33.730
second year of uni, I was probably about the same.

66
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.180
<v 1>Interest in dating. When you, uh, you know,</v>

67
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.610
you didn't never want to like date ago in school?

68
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.580
<v 0>No, I was on an all boys school. Of course. I love my boys.</v>

69
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.710
[inaudible] I don't care what you look like. It's all right. Yeah, no. Yeah.

70
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.160
I guess maybe it's because I went to a boys school that not to say that I didn't

71
00:03:59.161 --> 00:03:59.880
hang out with girls.

72
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.290
<v 1>I would love to have gone to a boys school yet.</v>

73
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.110
Even got the pressure of having to try and get across. Yeah.

74
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.850
I've got a girlfriend just because everyone else is getting one.

75
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.760
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, you know, not to say that I didn't have any interest in dating,</v>

76
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.350
but it's just like, it wasn't a priority.

77
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.750
<v 1>But I was speed running them in school, man. I,</v>

78
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.850
I never had one that lasted more than like two weeks.

79
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.160
<v 0>Oh yeah. That was school relationships.</v>

80
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.310
I had one that lost like three months and the boys were like,

81
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.670
you lost the three minutes. If you lost more, lots is a long time.

82
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.380
It's a long time. That's a, that's a dedicated relationship beyond a month.

83
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.590
It's like, okay. I am dedicated to re probably getting married.

84
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.160
You know what I mean? It's like one step away from marriage, right. Was like,

85
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.350
my life set already off.

86
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.920
<v 1>I think I must have started paying attention to like how I looked at maybe.</v>

87
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.120
Well, okay. I say how I looked basically like everything else was like,

88
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.950
what am I going to wear a school outfit? You know,

89
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.040
my mum still bought all my clothes. So like, yeah.

90
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.810
<v 0>I'm not going to lie. I didn't start buying my own clothes until I moved out.</v>

91
00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.571
My mom was just like, yeah,

92
00:04:57.571 --> 00:05:01.560
I got this nice t-shirt it was like some $5 t-shirt from target. And I was like,

93
00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:02.394
yeah, that.

94
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.590
<v 1>My mom still buys me clothes and sends them.</v>

95
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.110
And it sucks that she's better taste than me.

96
00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.610
<v 0>That's weird. Hockey's mom buys me clothes, but my own mother doesn't anymore.</v>

97
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.420
Remember us? We did a shoot like a, like a week ago.

98
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.690
I remember Joey had to borrow when you would one of your t-shirts and just

99
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.210
seeing Joey in one of your, like, t-shirts, I'm just like,

100
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.700
this is such a Conner shirt. Cause he was just like,

101
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.690
it was just like a plain t-shirt it's literally that, but a different color.

102
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.800
It's a plain, t-shirt in a drab color. And I'm just like, man, this,

103
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.300
this just screams color. It's a color that I would never buy it as a color.

104
00:05:36.301 --> 00:05:37.860
That color would definitely.

105
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.680
<v 1>It's taken. Okay. Let's give you another one. There's weird kind of things.</v>

106
00:05:40.681 --> 00:05:43.170
Right? Cause I've only like last year,

107
00:05:43.171 --> 00:05:47.220
have I been open to the idea with owning shirts that have nothing but playing

108
00:05:47.221 --> 00:05:49.260
color? Right. For some reason.

109
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.930
<v 0>In my head is because you don't like logos. I hated.</v>

110
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.840
<v 1>Logos and prints. They drove me insane. I don't know.</v>

111
00:05:54.841 --> 00:05:57.920
For some reason it just looked cheap to me and always, and that's

112
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.340
normally that cheaper, these, these kids?

113
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.830
<v 0>No, I guess it depends because some, some,</v>

114
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.090
some of them can look very tacky and I feel like there's a fine line between

115
00:06:10.091 --> 00:06:14.650
having a cool print and having like a cool piece of artwork that just looks

116
00:06:14.651 --> 00:06:15.484
tacky on it.

117
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.050
<v 1>Yeah. Like, you know, it's the whole concept of like simple as best sometimes,</v>

118
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.980
you know,

119
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.770
let's like the whole reason why like all those like high brand shots and like

120
00:06:23.771 --> 00:06:25.750
that. It's so simple. I mean, I think,

121
00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:29.380
I think that's what changed my opinion of like fashion in general is I do,

122
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.320
I have started to be more open to spending a bit more money on clothes.

123
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.640
Cause at the end of the day, it's like, all right,

124
00:06:33.641 --> 00:06:37.690
I'm wearing this for like how many months I'm going to be on camera as well,

125
00:06:37.691 --> 00:06:42.100
especially. So like, I want to wear shirts. I mean today, I'll see, I'm still,

126
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.610
I've still got a little bit of the old [inaudible] recently. I've been like,

127
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.700
okay, I'm willing to spend like 80 bucks on a t-shirt,

128
00:06:48.701 --> 00:06:53.590
which is unthinkable to me three years. Oh yeah. Bear in mind in university.

129
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:54.550
I used to get a prime Mark,

130
00:06:54.551 --> 00:06:56.020
which if you don't know what prime markets is in the UK.

131
00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.060
<v 0>Prime, Mark's amazing. By the way, it's basically about on prime market.</v>

132
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.880
I'm going to fight you on it.

133
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.450
<v 1>Well, I mean, it's, you know, I,</v>

134
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:04.810
I don't want to question how they make the shirts so cheap.

135
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.250
I'm sure there's some ethical question.

136
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.390
I remember I specifically bought eight t-shirts for 10 pounds,

137
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.090
which is like $15. Amazing.

138
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.900
And I love these shirts because they were all playing thing on them.

139
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.330
And I wore them for like two years straight. These shirts,

140
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.190
they were by the end of it.

141
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.700
<v 0>For real, the prime Mark is like one of the best,</v>

142
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.200
low budgets kind of clothing brands I've ever seen globally.

143
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.730
Honestly like the you can get for the price of prime Mark,

144
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.730
which I don't know where prime Mark's available internationally on it.

145
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.400
Cause I know it's in Europe. It's like,

146
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.580
if you want a budget place where you can just buy cheap clothes that don't read,

147
00:07:42.581 --> 00:07:43.720
that don't look cheap.

148
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.500
<v 1>Cause people said, Uniclo here is cheap. And we have Uniclo in the UK.</v>

149
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.680
It's not Uniclo compared to prime. Mark is like,

150
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.800
Uniqlo is cheap for the quality that you get.

151
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.640
Like you'll pay a little bit extra for like a t-shirt at Uniqlo,

152
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.710
but that going to last, you like 10 plus years,

153
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:04.600
I bought a whole suit from prime Mark for like $40.

154
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.950
<v 0>30 Pounds. The 30 pound set. Yeah, I did exactly the same for my.</v>

155
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:14.260
<v 1>My graduation. I wore a $40 suit and actually I hate to say it,</v>

156
00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:16.600
but it's like, it doesn't look that bad. It's not bad.

157
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.550
<v 0>It's not bad. That's the thing. I mean,</v>

158
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.490
prime Mark basically carried my university years.

159
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:23.583
<v 1>But there's a big pot.</v>

160
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.410
And a lot of people in the UK tend to also have the same mindset.

161
00:08:26.411 --> 00:08:29.440
I think where the t-shirt should never cost more than 20, 30 pounds,

162
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.770
which I can understand because if you haven't got a lot of money spending that

163
00:08:32.771 --> 00:08:36.460
much on one t-shirt is really quite a lot. It's quite a lot. But you know,

164
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.040
as I started to, uh, I think that's where my,

165
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.430
my hatred of print started is that I thought a lot of these prime Mark ones are

166
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.700
pretty and they often do look super tacky.

167
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.360
I don't really like the collaborations they have, like SpongeBob and.

168
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.490
And then all that, you know, they like, Oh yeah, we suck.

169
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.250
<v 0>I think they're just starting to do anime as well. Which is weird.</v>

170
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.760
I feel like was it last year where they did like a DBZ,

171
00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:03.510
a one piece collaboration as well? Yeah. There's been a lot of stores like that,

172
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:05.640
like forever 21 as well before they went under,

173
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.550
like they did this like huge thing with anime.

174
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.260
So like every time I went to forever 21,

175
00:09:10.261 --> 00:09:13.990
there was always like this entire section of anime. But when you look at it,

176
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.050
when, when you actually go over to it, it's just like, all right,

177
00:09:16.051 --> 00:09:19.170
let's see what they have. It's all like Shayla moon. DragonBallZ.

178
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.140
<v 1>All the basic. Gimme.</v>

179
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.380
<v 0>That. I don't want it done in like a creative way either. It's just like,</v>

180
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.570
let's just slap the logo and the main character,

181
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.340
like doing anime clothes is really hard and we're probably going to have to like

182
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.920
call out like a bunch of, of you is my saying this.

183
00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:38.040
But like the ones I hate the most are the ones where it's just like,

184
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.530
it's just a t-shirt with a wifi on it.

185
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.710
[inaudible] anatomy logo.

186
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:48.210
Like those kinds of clothes I call like anime convention, cloves. Cause it's,

187
00:09:48.211 --> 00:09:52.080
it's, it's a t-shirt or clothes that I would only wear at an anime convention,

188
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.830
but there's no way I would wear pajamas.

189
00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.680
The only time I'm wearing it is when I need to wear something in bed for someone

190
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.860
is probably someone watching this right now in like a Oslow t-shirt to be like,

191
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:06.503
Ooh.

192
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.290
<v 1>And then like, I think as well,</v>

193
00:10:09.291 --> 00:10:12.950
going back to the whole cheap versus expensive stuff for clothes,

194
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:14.890
like it's only because I think, cause I moved to Japan,

195
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.420
I actually started seeing like some of the clothes that I like really like,

196
00:10:17.421 --> 00:10:19.130
and it's like kind of expensive, but you're like, okay,

197
00:10:19.131 --> 00:10:23.960
I am going to wear this a lot. Like when I paid like 350 bucks, for that,

198
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:27.350
that do you follow, uh, sorry. King Crimson jacket. Yeah.

199
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:29.660
Like when I bought that, that was the most expensive thing I'd ever bought,

200
00:10:29.661 --> 00:10:32.240
like clothes wise. And I thought, Oh my God, this is insane.

201
00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:36.920
But that's this peak insane $350 on a jacket. It's sexy.

202
00:10:36.921 --> 00:10:40.340
Look on screen. It's sexy. But now that I've been wearing it,

203
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.070
I wear it like pretty much every day. Like I'm like, okay,

204
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:45.080
if I'm wearing it every day, you know,

205
00:10:45.081 --> 00:10:47.630
and I get like maybe four or five years out of that.

206
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.240
<v 0>That's right. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.</v>

207
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.870
<v 1>Cause I always thought that way with tech, right? Like to me, it's like,</v>

208
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.650
don't buy a $20 headset by a hundred dollars at least because you're gonna get

209
00:10:57.651 --> 00:10:58.484
your money's worth.

210
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.250
And I don't know why for some reason to be so long to have that with fashion.

211
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.960
And I think going back to the whole topic,

212
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.110
which is school and why I didn't give a is cause I didn't,

213
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.710
I just didn't care for clothes. I didn't really understand fashion at all.

214
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:12.060
I just looked like I,

215
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.890
there was always that one kid in your school who somehow always dressed amazing

216
00:11:15.891 --> 00:11:16.724
to.

217
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:21.750
<v 0>I didn't have that kid. I did not have that kid. I always, I dunno. I,</v>

218
00:11:21.751 --> 00:11:25.520
I had kind of like a similar view of fashion, which is just, I didn't get it.

219
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.260
I didn't understand anyone who would spend above like yeah. 20,

220
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.630
$20 or like $30 on the t-shirt.

221
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:37.340
<v 1>I think my mum would like scoff. If my, if an outfit was over total $50,</v>

222
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.350
she'd be like, look at, get a little bit. Yeah.

223
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:40.430
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

224
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.160
I think that's the thing that it was that at least with me there was this light

225
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.140
because it was a boys school, but there was this whole,

226
00:11:45.141 --> 00:11:48.170
I guess like stigma of dress world,

227
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.030
like that whole. Right. So I think people just I'm sure there were,

228
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.160
who actually did give a about fashion and did it, but they didn't want to,

229
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.040
because they'll probably worried about getting beaten up and like,

230
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.070
like I get that, you know, like it's, it's like, yes,

231
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.460
a fedora might seem quite fashionable, you know, in the comment. I,

232
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.870
but why would you wear that if you don't want to get bullied? You know,

233
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:14.640
like I like wearing doors. I think they look cool with the right outfit. But,

234
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:20.220
but the problem is a lot of, um, I agree with Joey, I feel like,

235
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:25.020
I feel like the frog, the big problem with fedoras is that the,

236
00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.480
like the neck beard community

237
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.990
ruined that slim to hit the mustache.

238
00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.760
You can't wear it because Hitler's ruined it.

239
00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.580
It's the same thing with the fedora. You can't do it. Cause you're going,

240
00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.370
everyone's like in the salad, that's the thing. But it's like,

241
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.370
but that's the problem I feel is that a lot of the reasons why fedora is just

242
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:45.510
commonly seen as that type of, you know, negative thing is because the,

243
00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.900
the hat itself is fine. It's what you pair it with. Yeah.

244
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:50.460
Just makes it look like absolutely dog.

245
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:53.010
What you thought you're either going to look like a neck beard or you going to

246
00:12:53.011 --> 00:12:55.740
look like a rip off Michael Jackson? No. In between, I mean,

247
00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.830
I'd rather look like a rip off Michael Jackson than a neck beat. Right.

248
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.540
But like, but like I've seen, you can truly enjoy your life.

249
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.780
I've seen like fashion magazines of like dudes who like, you know,

250
00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:13.410
wear a fedora or like a hat of some kind that's similar to a fedora in like a

251
00:13:13.411 --> 00:13:14.640
really nice suit. Yeah.

252
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.360
We can match that with those like the most attractive men on the plane. Well,

253
00:13:18.361 --> 00:13:20.220
that's what I'm saying. Right. And that's the,

254
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:25.110
that's the other problem is that no attractive man who waited for doors. Well,

255
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.560
I'm just saying, I'm just, I'm just preaching to the choir right now, but that,

256
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:29.430
you know, that's, I mean,

257
00:13:29.431 --> 00:13:32.170
I'm not going to lie and pretend I know how fashion works, you know,

258
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:34.260
I'm not fashion.

259
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.660
[inaudible] I was like, let me teach you about fashion. I mean,

260
00:13:43.661 --> 00:13:47.940
I feel like having that one kid in school who elevated the game really elevated

261
00:13:47.941 --> 00:13:50.820
the elevated the game and ski was the benchmark. He was,

262
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.780
he was the trend system. He can be look bad. You know,

263
00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.330
we need sends up with his jeans, with holes in them. I'm like,

264
00:13:57.331 --> 00:13:59.340
how can we compete? I don't have holes in my jeans.
