1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.090
<v 0>Gentlemen gentlemen, here's my nine. My, my arguably,</v>

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.710
arguably the strongest name we've had today.

3
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.690
You want to go from top left to bottom? Uh, Hunter Hunter, golden time.

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.440
Uh [inaudible] uh, ping-pong animation Sakamoto,

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.470
Kai mob cycle 100, but on a fish and Jojo.

6
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.630
<v 1>I'll tell you what this is. This is the guys I have good tastes.</v>

7
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.600
Good guys. Guys. You want to know a personality?

8
00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:32.180
I have absolutely no personality.

9
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.020
Sorry that I don't like incest gone. Is that what you want to see on my list?

10
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.810
The lack of him says, this is the, this is the,

11
00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:42.950
I cite my sources in my video essay, like levels of like taste.

12
00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:43.784
You know what I mean?

13
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.040
<v 0>If I had to use a name like the top nine shows that I have,</v>

14
00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:51.170
and like a little bit of variation genre, this'll be it.

15
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.760
<v 1>No, because I look at this list and I'm just like, yeah, this is, this is what,</v>

16
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.860
this is what my nine by nine would be.

17
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.520
If I literally went through my like modern Mao and just pick the top highest

18
00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:03.120
rated animate on that map. I'm trying,

19
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.430
I'm trying to take my tastes and enemy God. And this is my taste. I dunno, man.

20
00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:11.240
Like he did it to normal. This is no, no, no. It's not even normally.

21
00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:12.530
It's just it's try-hard.

22
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.740
<v 0>Legit. This is legit. My, my favorite nine shows. Well, I mean,</v>

23
00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:20.270
obviously we don't have to talk about hunt on tickets.

24
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.680
We've talked about golden time. Golden time is like my favorite Volcker on her.

25
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.933
Yeah. Ping pong.

26
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.830
<v 1>Can you kick him? Can you talk about ping-pong.</v>

27
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.800
<v 0>A hundred percent, right? I love ping pong. Ping pong. Right?</v>

28
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.630
Other than like mob. Okay.

29
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.430
That's also why I love them all for the similar reasons.

30
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.800
Like ping-pong is like one of the only enemies, right?

31
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.480
You got all these stupid animals where the guys ops. it. No one gives a.

32
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.110
Right? Like, okay. Wow. Kyoto is a giant Dick again. Right? Cool.

33
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.840
We have another use of guy. Oh, they're overpowered or, Oh,

34
00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:50.900
they have an ability that unique to them. You know what? Real life sucks, man.

35
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.270
No one has a unique ability and I've really liked.

36
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.390
There was a anime that was like, bro, life kind of sucks, man.

37
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.210
Sometimes people just got to be better at things that you love,

38
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.720
even if they hate it. That's what, but that was so real. And it hurt, man.

39
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.290
It hurt because I've been on both sides of the ping pong, like animation,

40
00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:09.800
like the characters. I've been talented at something that I hated.

41
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.220
And I felt bad for people who really wanted to be good at that thing that I was

42
00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:13.610
good at.

43
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.420
And I've also tried my hottest at something and you speak Japanese fluently. So,

44
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.150
you know, I've been on both sides of the spectrum of things on the animation.

45
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.830
So I'm kidding. No, but.

46
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.660
<v 1>Really ping, ping pong, ping pong. What I call on what I call ping pong.</v>

47
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.410
It's a lifespan.

48
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.480
<v 0>Yeah. It, it, it hurt because I was like,</v>

49
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.270
you really had to like pull that out of me. Like that,

50
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.390
that made me a little like, God. Okay. Yeah. Then I'm curious.

51
00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:37.580
Have you seen a March comes in like a line?

52
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:38.750
<v 1>No. Okay.</v>

53
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.370
Cause I think if you loved ping-pong you would love that because mom's comes in

54
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:47.600
like a lion is the complete opposite Muslims in like a line is about a genius

55
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.100
who can't understand the idea of losing. Yeah. Right.

56
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.700
But that in itself is what's causing him to lose in real life. Yeah.

57
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.470
So it's literally the opposite of paintball,

58
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.100
but that's the same school when they're like you're a gifted.

59
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.110
<v 0>Child, then they can't do anything later on it.</v>

60
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.300
<v 1>Right. Exactly. I mean, and obviously like, uh, I don't wait.</v>

61
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.950
<v 0>[Inaudible] that's so funny, man.</v>

62
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.130
My boy is hilarious. Second Modo is one of the funniest.

63
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.480
<v 1>Sacramento is so good. It's so fun. It's so funny. You can put that.</v>

64
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.370
<v 0>It's like the Mr. Bean of Adams.</v>

65
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.000
<v 1>It's like the misdemeanor of animated,</v>

66
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.880
Mr. Bean was like a like handsome millionaire who was playing.

67
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.880
<v 0>So you really get to a me when you just like were like, yeah. Pedophilia.</v>

68
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.240
<v 1>Here's what I don't understand though. Every three by three, right.</v>

69
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.180
As we've established so far in every three by three I've seen back when it was

70
00:03:48.181 --> 00:03:48.810
big,

71
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.730
has at least one show that like universally.

72
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.350
Right? That is just a. I think all of these shows are fantastic, which is why.

73
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.690
<v 0>I just press X to doubt. I just don't like shows Jerry,</v>

74
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.810
would you think it would have put like my whole mouth demon of some in this?

75
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.920
They still listing was mad as.

76
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.760
<v 1>I dunno. Like you don't have like a, do you have a guilty pleasure enemy?</v>

77
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.660
<v 0>Honestly. No, not really. I don't, I don't really watch anime ever.</v>

78
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.570
The grand reveal. I frankly I've revealed this before. I don't, I never want,

79
00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:28.920
I never want to rewatch anime. Right. So you wouldn't really watch any of these.

80
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.350
No. Why would I be watching a 40 watch?

81
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.350
<v 1>Because it's great because you don't want to re-experience it. Yeah.</v>

82
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.380
<v 0>Not really. I'll be honest with you. I'd rather experience that.</v>

83
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.310
<v 1>So there's no show. You will never have you never gotten to the point right?</v>

84
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.080
Where you're just, you just,

85
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.610
you're just tired of trying something new and because no, no, no, no. You're,

86
00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:49.290
you're tired of trying something new.

87
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.040
<v 0>Why do we need the sensor sad? I'm just tired of trying. I'm going to go back.</v>

88
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.270
<v 1>What does this? Because,</v>

89
00:04:54.271 --> 00:04:56.940
because sometimes you try something to you and you you're just like, man,

90
00:04:56.941 --> 00:04:59.250
this just ain't doing it for me. You just want something,

91
00:04:59.251 --> 00:05:00.600
you want something that it's comfortable.

92
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.540
<v 0>Yeah. It's yeah. I don't know. For me that feels sad.</v>

93
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.930
It feels like you're trying to capture something that's gone in your life.

94
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.651
You know what I mean? I don't know.

95
00:05:07.651 --> 00:05:10.830
I feel sad time in this photo and I don't like it, but you're like, I dunno,

96
00:05:10.831 --> 00:05:13.170
like you're chasing something that doesn't exist anymore in my mind.

97
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.960
<v 1>Of me because in my mind, right. I got go. I could, I could easily watch.</v>

98
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.070
<v 0>Yes. Would I willingly do it of my own free will?</v>

99
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.670
<v 1>No, no. Because like I E to, to bring it the other way,</v>

100
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.690
like for me watching new shows is me chasing that high. That,

101
00:05:30.691 --> 00:05:34.950
that is me chasing that high that I felt with the shows I've already liked,

102
00:05:34.951 --> 00:05:37.770
but the more anime you watch and just the older you get,

103
00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:38.880
that just gets harder and harder.

104
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.540
<v 0>Don't watch my channel anymore. And that's it.</v>

105
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.350
<v 1>Like reveal of this video? God doesn't work.</v>

106
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.290
<v 0>No, I do. I watch anime and I should try it.</v>

107
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.550
<v 1>I mean, look, honestly, like I feeling SaaS about this three by three,</v>

108
00:05:53.551 --> 00:05:54.480
just because again,

109
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.220
because all nine of these shows are like universally praised. All right.

110
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.550
It's golden time university praise. I like more was trash.

111
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.660
I love golden golden time. It was golden time.

112
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.500
Took everything towards trash and I liked it,

113
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:12.690
but it was trout golden time took everything Tara Dora did and just perfected

114
00:06:12.691 --> 00:06:13.524
it. Yeah.

115
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.420
<v 0>I would literally it's like, if you, like, in my mind,</v>

116
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.100
it's like my two favorite, like Roman.

117
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.680
<v 1>Yeah. Golden time.</v>

118
00:06:20.681 --> 00:06:24.430
But golden time felt like the better on golden time is my favorite romance of

119
00:06:24.431 --> 00:06:27.730
all time. I would think. Yeah. Golden time.

120
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.690
[inaudible] I've met less people who say they didn't like golden time. Yeah.

121
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.710
Cause like the thing about golden time is that, you know, there are,

122
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.820
there were floors because to the liked Banbury as a character, let's be honest.

123
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.450
Like I just like talk, talking about compressing your memory.

124
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.020
Like I I've only just remembered that ghost boundary was the thing.

125
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.670
And now it's just something I've just liked.

126
00:06:51.671 --> 00:06:54.850
That was like a black spot in this like amazing series.

127
00:06:54.851 --> 00:06:57.610
That's I seem to remember golden time, but like, I think that's a golden time.

128
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.850
I just think this is, this is how adult romance should be. This is,

129
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.100
this took everything that was good.

130
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.190
As you said about Torah Dora and just made it better, perfected it,

131
00:07:06.191 --> 00:07:07.210
put it in university.

132
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.960
Didn't make it like just this high school romance had enough adult elements that

133
00:07:10.961 --> 00:07:14.470
didn't have an annoying lowly yonder. She was really,

134
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.850
I love kg. The, again, the gambler that was amazing. She's great.

135
00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.800
<v 0>Well, my favorite shows and it's sad that no one gives a chance,</v>

136
00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:24.370
but it also weird that it's only in seven 20 P that's pretty weird.

137
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.850
No 40 P I think or something. It was never released.

138
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:30.700
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

139
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.880
<v 0>And it's such a shame because it's such a good show,</v>

140
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.130
but it was either that or like one ounce. I really love.

141
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.610
<v 1>What else is fun you, but I mean, I don't know.</v>

142
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.480
<v 0>Yes. I mean, I guess it looks very basic from the.</v>

143
00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.640
<v 1>No, it's not basic. It's amazing.</v>

144
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.870
It's not basic in the sense where we were putting on nine favorite shows.

145
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:55.480
But what we're saying is that like there isn't a single guilty pleasure enemy

146
00:07:55.481 --> 00:07:57.130
here because obviously.

147
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.760
<v 0>Guilty pleasure enemy while I could show her those bad or emo that's more than</v>

148
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:01.390
okay.

149
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.200
<v 1>That's criminal, in my opinion,</v>

150
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.990
a guilty pleasure is a show that you love no matter what, even though you know.

151
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.590
<v 0>It is. Yep. Okay. But then when I was making this nine by nine,</v>

152
00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:13.600
like say dead man Wonderland, I love to have my Wonderland,

153
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.480
but I never finished. And it was, you know, it was kind of because of it,

154
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.730
but like, I don't think it's better than any of these shows.

155
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:23.140
<v 1>Cause like I've, I've talked to you and I know what your tastes are basically.</v>

156
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.580
And I don't see a call me out.

157
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.810
I don't really see that representative because I know like my tastes like,

158
00:08:28.811 --> 00:08:30.670
you know me gone, what do you mean? I mean, like you,

159
00:08:30.671 --> 00:08:34.630
you hung out for a couple of years. I'm only like one of your face.

160
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.360
We only see each other every day.

161
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:42.400
Like I know you love like hardcore brutal shows like Joe,

162
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:47.740
Joe backy Gantz. I'm surprised. I thought back he was going to,

163
00:08:47.741 --> 00:08:49.270
I fell back. He was going to be up there as well.

164
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.330
<v 0>I mean, I love Becky as like this,</v>

165
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:54.700
cause there's a few episodes in and it's like Mitch,

166
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.960
but that was so many funny moments that like it'll stand on me forever. Right.

167
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.400
<v 1>Here's the best way I can put this.</v>

168
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.050
I know you like Chad shows that that's the best way.

169
00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.060
That's the best way I can just watch him on his tastes. Like, like it's,

170
00:09:07.061 --> 00:09:10.220
it's like, it's just got Chad characters in it. You know what I mean?

171
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:11.090
Tried characters.

172
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:15.590
That's why I really want Connor to watch or read faster Norstar. No,

173
00:09:15.591 --> 00:09:19.580
you would love that. I like the right amount of chat. It's just too much chat.

174
00:09:19.581 --> 00:09:23.210
Sometimes a little too much. You know? What do you mean? You might Jojo.

175
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.140
<v 0>That's a different, that's a different kind of chat.</v>

176
00:09:27.141 --> 00:09:30.950
That's like Jody was like the built different anime, like that's its own league.

177
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.040
So as I had said, like I think Judah should even be treated as animate.

178
00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:34.874
It's a lifestyle.

179
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.270
<v 1>Yeah. It's an artwork. But like, I dunno.</v>

180
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:39.920
<v 0>Especially the North star. When I see that,</v>

181
00:09:39.921 --> 00:09:41.270
I don't really find it appealing because that like,

182
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.660
they're just like to match show. I want a bit of weakness to the character.

183
00:09:44.661 --> 00:09:45.380
Right? I mean.

184
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.630
<v 1>If you've read it you'll know, every character is weak.</v>

185
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.520
<v 0>As. Really. Okay. Okay. Fine. Fine. Fine.</v>

186
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.040
<v 1>I think you should read it. You'll love it. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

187
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.350
It me off when I'm watching an anime and the man.

188
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:58.580
<v 0>Character is like a wimp beyond comprehension and just cause us any problems</v>

189
00:09:58.581 --> 00:10:00.710
himself because he's a wimp and I'm like, listen,

190
00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:01.970
all you gotta do is just say no.

191
00:10:01.971 --> 00:10:04.370
And you wouldn't have been dragged off to a cult or something about DECA.

192
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.390
I don't know. There's something else.

193
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:06.800
There's a lot of shows where I'm just like,

194
00:10:06.801 --> 00:10:10.070
this literally could have been avoided if you just like slept yourself two

195
00:10:10.071 --> 00:10:11.180
seconds. Like this whole problem.

196
00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:16.480
<v 1>No, I'm not satisfied. I'm not satisfied.</v>

197
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.350
Just some. You know what I mean? Like you're expecting me to have to,

198
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.820
this is like, this is like too polished. I have good tastes. What can I say?

199
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.600
I can, I can make a better nine, a three by three by three by three.

200
00:10:29.601 --> 00:10:33.680
For me it would be like, like I said, I'll see if it's fair to be Joe, Joe,

201
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.470
Bucky, Becky. But like, I.

202
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.020
<v 0>Love Becky, but it's not in my top nine shows.</v>

203
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.050
<v 1>But you talk about it so often. Yeah. But like.</v>

204
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:42.981
<v 0>I love it, but it's,</v>

205
00:10:42.981 --> 00:10:46.010
I wouldn't put it higher than any of these for enjoyment in my mind.

206
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.050
<v 1>But like it's it's okay. Because.</v>

207
00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.320
<v 0>I love and show that I want to talk about, I like different, I guess.</v>

208
00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.350
<v 1>But it's okay. Like this is, this is like getting here.</v>

209
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:57.470
<v 0>I guess this, we should have defined the rules more appropriately.</v>

210
00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.740
Should be like kind of give me the nine shows that you think about keep you up

211
00:11:00.741 --> 00:11:01.220
at night.

212
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.650
<v 1>Yeah. That's what I did. I did.</v>

213
00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.100
They used to put your nine favorite shows that represent you. What? Like,

214
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:10.670
what I don't understand is you say that like the shows I talk about and the

215
00:11:10.671 --> 00:11:12.800
shows I like are not the same. Why would you talk about a show?

216
00:11:12.801 --> 00:11:13.634
If it's not your favorite?

217
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.130
<v 0>Right? It's like, well, ping pong. Right? Right.</v>

218
00:11:16.131 --> 00:11:18.710
It's all of it is encapsulating the show. There's nothing more to add.

219
00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:21.500
I'm like just watch it. Like it's amazing. I love it.

220
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.260
<v 1>I can't, I can't improve. Nobody's talking about that.</v>

221
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.060
That that's that's the exact point. Right? Because you,

222
00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:28.940
sometimes you see a good show and you're like, me. That was a good shot.

223
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:31.580
Like I like love to talk about it. Yeah. Yeah.

224
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.130
But sometimes you watch a show and you're like, man, this is,

225
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.310
this is sticking with me. You know what I mean? This is I I'm punk rock with me.

226
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.680
Huh? I'm not saying people shouldn't be on this, but like what,

227
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:45.890
what shouldn't be on this Hunter, Hunter, dude, Hunter, Hunter, bro. That.

228
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.540
That move me, man.

229
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:53.950
I see you talking more about Bucky than Hunter Hunter. Yeah, let's do because.

230
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:55.293
<v 0>Okay. Let's be.</v>

231
00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:59.030
<v 1>Psycho and Hunter. And so I rarely hear you talking about it.</v>

232
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.030
<v 0>I talk about one punchline,</v>

233
00:12:02.031 --> 00:12:05.430
more than talk about mob psycho one punch because I think motorcycles a better

234
00:12:05.431 --> 00:12:07.830
show than one punch, man. Well then why wouldn't you talk about mob psycho,

235
00:12:07.831 --> 00:12:09.270
if it's a better shot? Well, again,

236
00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.210
because it's about a show and I feel like there's not much to say it's amazing.

237
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.870
Like just go watch it. Like, but this is like my favorite show.

238
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.780
I love Becky right? Where I have to sit there and be like, listen,

239
00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:21.900
get to the part where he someone and becomes extra powerful.

240
00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.110
Like I love having that conversation again. If you haven't seen Becky,

241
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.170
there was a scene where he has sex, honestly.

242
00:12:28.171 --> 00:12:31.560
And that one scene is enough to be like animated of the year of my mind.

243
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.460
I like give it. That's exactly what I'm to about.

244
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:36.990
That's exactly.

245
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.020
<v 1>That's a scene that stuck with you and you can bring up and you.</v>

246
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
<v 0>Why was that? Not the way that I see it is that like,</v>

247
00:12:45.001 --> 00:12:47.280
let's say God wants to take me to like an event. And he's like,

248
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:50.070
he has to specifically tell me like kind of don't bring up the back of the sex

249
00:12:50.071 --> 00:12:52.530
scene to like my friends. That's the level of like,

250
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.730
I just want to talk about it like that.

251
00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:56.640
It's not like it's defined by taste for some reason.

252
00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.040
I just want to talk about that scene and how weird is.

253
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.250
<v 1>Because like I like kind of, kind of talking to you.</v>

254
00:13:02.251 --> 00:13:04.890
I know what sh what kind of shows you would like, you know, you,

255
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.480
you look at someone's mood three over three,

256
00:13:06.481 --> 00:13:08.970
and you can like recommend some shows that they would like, for example,

257
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.550
like I knew for example, that you would love a show.

258
00:13:11.551 --> 00:13:12.420
Like [inaudible], you know what I mean? Cause that

259
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:12.420
, that, that is Ramy. It's grimy. It's a Chad anime

260
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:12.420
. You know what I mean? It's just corner. It just, you know, I'm just going to

261
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.253
 say, if I didn't see this three by three and you told me.

262
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:28.830
<v 0>Breaking all the fish is like, and if you ask me, recommend me an anime.</v>

263
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.790
<v 1>The last one I would bring up for me, for you. Why it again,</v>

264
00:13:32.791 --> 00:13:34.500
it just doesn't seem like a show. You would like.

265
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.360
<v 0>What? I love that that's actually like.</v>

266
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.150
<v 1>I can say the biggest,</v>

267
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.920
the biggest one for me is like mob psycho and Hunter. Hunter.

268
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.500
<v 0>It's my favorite show and the volt. Sorry. Honda.</v>

269
00:13:46.501 --> 00:13:48.900
Honda is my favorite show of all time. What about Jojo?

270
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:50.700
I don't really count that as a Sheridan,

271
00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.510
but it is a show because it has to be categorized,

272
00:13:54.511 --> 00:13:55.980
but there's no dessert Jojo category,

273
00:13:55.981 --> 00:13:58.710
but they should be as far as I'm concerned, you know, what,

274
00:13:58.711 --> 00:14:02.640
what is this Jojo category then? I just, Joe Joe is like its own beast. Right?

275
00:14:02.641 --> 00:14:05.100
Like I can't, I there's nothing. You can compare Jojo.

276
00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.500
<v 1>No, I, I agree with him. I disagree.</v>

277
00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.800
<v 0>Pedro to do something right now to it. No.</v>

278
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:15.090
<v 1>It's it's it's not, it's not exactly the same. It's not exactly this.</v>

279
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.440
I'm not saying they're both the same thing,

280
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.950
but they give off the same kind of feeling. You know what I mean?

281
00:14:19.951 --> 00:14:20.730
Where it's just like,

282
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:24.750
there are some ridiculous things happening and you're just having a good time.

283
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.650
I'm not saying that they're on like the same level or anything,

284
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.860
but they give off the same vibe is what I'm talking about. But they're both,

285
00:14:31.861 --> 00:14:35.100
I've always said that just both insane. But the thing is,

286
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:40.170
is that a bunch of eighties and nineties in back then had this

287
00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:41.850
kind of feel to it? Yeah. Like FIS,

288
00:14:41.851 --> 00:14:45.840
the North star also has scenes where it's just like, what the did I just read?

289
00:14:45.841 --> 00:14:48.480
And you just recommended them that to him because he said, no, that's it.

290
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.530
<v 0>That's exactly what I'm was. You were like halfway through was like, right.</v>

291
00:14:51.531 --> 00:14:54.740
Let's just be gay now. Like that. That's that's like, I love that. Trust me.

292
00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:58.910
There's a lot of gay parts and I just thought it was like the manliest manly

293
00:14:58.911 --> 00:15:01.600
anime of in existence. Like I guess that's pretty gay. Yeah.

294
00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:02.463
<v 1>That is pretty good.</v>

295
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.660
There's a thing called Bharat. I don't know.

296
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.520
<v 0>I was going to say the why the, why I'm saying music videos pretty manly,</v>

297
00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.590
but I pinata fish is one of my favorite shows as well. love it. This is great.

298
00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:19.360
<v 1>But, but,</v>

299
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.360
but I was expecting that because you've talked about it for muffin on a fish.

300
00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.930
Right. You've even made a whole video on pornography. So I expected that. But.

301
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.840
<v 0>So you're complaining that I picked good shows is that.</v>

302
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:33.640
<v 1>Yes, because everybody's three by three has to have at least one show where it's</v>

303
00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:34.474
like.

304
00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:37.510
<v 0>Let's see if I could put a bad show that I like in my three.</v>

305
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:43.060
<v 1>There's got to be a least one. You'll see the money. There's gotta be a,</v>

306
00:15:43.061 --> 00:15:47.860
what I'm saying is every three by three houses have at least one showed that you

307
00:15:47.861 --> 00:15:50.350
know is. You just don't look, look honestly,

308
00:15:50.351 --> 00:15:52.840
what is it that the world got in the nodes? That's a show.

309
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:53.703
Would you put that on yet?

310
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.040
<v 0>Yeah, probably would let you see what I'm making this. Right. We had like what,</v>

311
00:15:57.041 --> 00:15:58.810
like an hour to make this I'm thinking like, boom,

312
00:15:58.811 --> 00:16:01.660
I'm putting my favorites on that. The classics. Okay.

313
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.393
<v 1>He's a bit of, I can word it.</v>

314
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:08.380
I understood more about you as a person from your hint. I tastes than I do.

315
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:09.933
<v 0>But that's,</v>

316
00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:14.410
I feel like anyone could get my hand tight tastes to figure out kind of

317
00:16:14.411 --> 00:16:15.970
recommends mother knows breasts.

318
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.570
<v 1>I look at this and I'm like,</v>

319
00:16:22.571 --> 00:16:26.140
this could be anyone's three minutes or this was a,

320
00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.420
this was a randomly generated image.

321
00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:36.430
I said this was made by an AI learning program from like the randomly generated

322
00:16:36.431 --> 00:16:38.950
sample from people's top light.

323
00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:41.860
I put in the AI inoffensive.

324
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.550
<v 0>Yeah. There's a lot of them and like in good faith, I couldn't put on there.</v>

325
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.640
Cause I'm like, I honestly don't remember that much from the show. So like,

326
00:16:48.641 --> 00:16:52.150
I don't know what to put on there. Like these are the nine shows, right?

327
00:16:52.151 --> 00:16:54.250
If you like name, name nine shows that you love right away.

328
00:16:54.251 --> 00:16:55.084
These are the first night.

329
00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:58.600
<v 1>Okay. I'll be honest with you. Honestly. I may, maybe it does make sense.</v>

330
00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.580
Cause REM you think REM is your wife.

331
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:07.840
That's just like zero. That tells me zero about you as this by three.

332
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:10.600
This is the most vanilla vanilla.

333
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:15.040
<v 0>I'm sorry. There's no gang bang or Opry or grape incest in here. Okay.</v>

334
00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.880
<v 1>What I'm what I'm trying to say is I like good shows too.</v>

335
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:23.170
<v 0>I'm sorry that you like Harry Susan, me or even galleon and a black lagoon.</v>

336
00:17:23.171 --> 00:17:25.540
The most to thousands of animating existence.

337
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:30.220
<v 1>The fact is that that shows the fact is the fact is that you got something about</v>

338
00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:33.010
all my tastes. You can get it about this. I like good.

339
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.380
Why is that hard to understand? I look at this.

340
00:17:35.381 --> 00:17:37.960
This could be any one of our fans. Well,

341
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:43.630
this could be our fans have any one of our fans who was like trying to impress

342
00:17:43.631 --> 00:17:47.410
us, being like, yes, my favorite YouTube. But I also have good animators.

343
00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:48.250
I have.

344
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.380
<v 0>Good taste. When you going to do about it, have taste, jokes that you.</v>

345
00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:54.760
<v 1>Want for it. Yeah. I was expecting I'm built different anyone to have a taste.</v>

346
00:17:54.761 --> 00:17:55.930
