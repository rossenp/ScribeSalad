WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.520
<v 0>Yeah. I'll tell you what I do miss that.</v>

2
00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:05.160
I didn't think I would dairy milk chocolate. Yeah.

3
00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:09.030
I liked dairy milk because I thought whenever I came to Japan on holiday and

4
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:11.550
stuff, I was like, I was like, man, the chocolate here's bomb.

5
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:14.970
I loved the taste. And then after living here a year,

6
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.880
I just feel like I've really used some, some something, something.

7
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.510
<v 1>Dairy milk they've taken the American way of making a chocolate does say it's</v>

8
00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:24.140
like American,

9
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.290
because what they've done is instead of having more milk and making it like a

10
00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:31.040
richer taste, they're like, Hm, let's just substitute with more sugar. Yeah.

11
00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:33.260
And then you get this kind of weird chemically taste,

12
00:00:33.261 --> 00:00:36.590
which I like Hershey's does Hoshi tastes like,

13
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.270
just in my mind, like question marks with sugar. It's like,

14
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.000
I don't know what this tastes like. It doesn't taste like chocolate.

15
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.020
It tastes like a made,

16
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.860
I am not a fan of Hershey's chocolate does not taste like chocolate.

17
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.480
<v 0>I used to you're like really? Like Hershey's I still kind of do whenever,</v>

18
00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:55.390
whenever I'm like in the UK, whenever.

19
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.470
<v 1>It's not as rich. So you can eat more of it. Yeah.</v>

20
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.190
<v 0>Because what Hershey's tastes like, it tastes like cooking chocolate. Right.</v>

21
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.490
And I don't know why I like the melting pot. I don't know why as a kid,

22
00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:07.220
I loved cooking chocolate because I, it just,

23
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.110
it just like normally for poor quality quality, but as a kid,

24
00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:13.880
I just like, anytime we'd like cook chocolate,

25
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.130
I just like always have to dip my finger in it. And

26
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.230
that's what Hershey's tastes like. So as an adult eating Hershey's tea,

27
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.770
like brings me back to being a kid. And then I have two bars and I'm just like,

28
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.940
okay, this is actually the [inaudible] gone.

29
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.260
It's just chocolate. Now.

30
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.230
<v 1>American's fan you have a rough ban. I know we clowned you guys all the time,</v>

31
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.390
but light your chocolate is awful.

32
00:01:35.391 --> 00:01:39.020
Please like import some like milk or dairy mackerel thing. Yeah.

33
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.430
<v 0>The Cadbury milk chocolate or the best Cadbury's dairy. Cadres is dairy milk.</v>

34
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.290
<v 1>White American company now. But it used to be, I mean,</v>

35
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.820
a lot of the British chocolate's really good.

36
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.770
I think that's one of the things we actually did pretty well.

37
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.100
I think chocolate in the UK is pretty good. Yeah.

38
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.540
<v 0>I think chocolate. I lived all over Europe. Yeah. That's pretty good.</v>

39
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.500
Get it from Europe honestly.

40
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.800
<v 1>Well, a bougie and then like the rest of Europe and like.</v>

41
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.100
<v 0>Swiss chocolates and stuff switched. I just switched shots. great.</v>

42
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.130
<v 1>It's great. But it's like, it's like seven bucks sometimes.</v>

43
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.640
<v 0>It's great. And I can, but every time I have a bite of Swiss chocolate,</v>

44
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.470
I can feel the chocolate entering my veins. Depends.

45
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.040
Cause I like, I think my favorite like big brand Swiss chocolate.

46
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.250
It's like lint. I do like, you got to like.

47
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.740
<v 1>Sit down after you have a bike.</v>

48
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.200
<v 0>It's great. You like doing a pint of cocaine. It's funny as you go on a journey.</v>

49
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.610
When, when, when you take that one by man, you just like, it needs to be like,

50
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.320
okay. When, when like the truffle inside,

51
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.030
it's just like the perfect consistency.

52
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.810
When you bite off the hard shell and it just the soft truffle and he's just

53
00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:48.710
like, ah, beautiful. My mouth is watering. Just describing it. I love a good

54
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.460
[inaudible] Herrera. She has shame milkshakes. I like the best thing ever.

55
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.730
Cheese ice, ice cream is fun. You can like.

56
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.840
<v 1>As well. You can like grind it into like a milkshake. It's amazing DIY.</v>

57
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.610
Oh wow. Some places do.

58
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.260
<v 0>Really. Oh, that sounds fun. I feel like I increase the clause.</v>

59
00:03:10.261 --> 00:03:13.890
Whenever I say forever Russia, I do most cautious word. I've like,

60
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.530
I can think of off the top of my head. I just sounded so good.

61
00:03:16.531 --> 00:03:20.310
I feel the molecule. I do need a top hat every time,

62
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.860
because I feel like you don't.

63
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.490
<v 1>Berry and Swiss chocolate. You don't eat Swiss chocolate. You know what I mean?</v>

64
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.810
You eat British chocolate.

65
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.900
<v 0>You can just eat. You know what I mean? The Swiss don't do drugs.</v>

66
00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:35.520
They do chocolate. Oh man.

67
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.840
Sometimes I like buy like a pack of Lin and I'm just like, I'm having it on my,

68
00:03:39.841 --> 00:03:40.674
having a good day.

69
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.890
<v 1>All of the like Lynn package in one go. Cause I can't like,</v>

70
00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:45.360
cause I feel like I need a pallet cleanser.

71
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.640
Every time I have like a rich chocolate. I'm like give me the,

72
00:03:47.641 --> 00:03:50.100
the wine to go with it. To empty the flavor.

73
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.790
<v 0>I have. I have a, like a problem where I have one it's enough.</v>

74
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.570
You have a sweet tooth though. Don't you? I do not have a sweet tooth. I don't.

75
00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.830
I actually, you always say I'm the only in Japan actually only in Japan.

76
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.130
Cause here's, here's the thing I hardly ever use the snack.

77
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.300
I either I either was that guy in England who would eat a tub of ice cream or

78
00:04:09.301 --> 00:04:12.660
not, I'll go without sweets for like two weeks. I like, I,

79
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.270
there was no in between for me, like only in Japan.

80
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.920
Have I ever like kind of embraced snacking culture and that's just because there

81
00:04:19.921 --> 00:04:22.070
are so many different kinds of sweets and snacks there,

82
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.010
like kind of want to try something. I used to be a sweets guy back in Australia,

83
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.120
but then when I moved here,

84
00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:30.660
I realized that Japan's snack all I confectionary section.

85
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.280
There's a lot more savory. It just tastes way better than the sweet. Yeah.

86
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.320
So I'm just, I always just go for the savory. Now.

87
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.170
<v 1>It's easy to make something that's tastes good. That's sweet though.</v>

88
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.093
You just put a.

89
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.610
<v 0>Ton of, because I also feel gross after eating,</v>

90
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.030
because if you ever come to my house in England, if you ask for like anything,

91
00:04:48.031 --> 00:04:49.290
that's not savory snack,

92
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.130
I'm probably not going to have it because if I do have a lint, like, uh,

93
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.450
like a chocolate or like a lint box, that's gone in like a few hours at a time.

94
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.810
That's cause I rarely buy. But when I'm doing I'm like, I'm like super craving.

95
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.250
Yeah. I dunno. I mean,

96
00:05:02.251 --> 00:05:05.010
I haven't had a furrow Shan like probably like a year and a half.

97
00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:07.770
Maybe it doesn't show them in Japan. Oh yeah. Yeah.

98
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.090
You never see them because if you go to like a like international show.

99
00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.750
<v 1>Yeah. Oh, because like in, in the UK that was like the not expensive.</v>

100
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.000
It's like the, the, if you want to look expensive,

101
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.790
but not actually spend too much money for, with it.

102
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.390
<v 0>I'll see it. Like I never know. Russia just looks fancy.</v>

103
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:26.370
It sounds fancy.

104
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.250
<v 1>Fancy is like the price tag. I mean they're expensive.</v>

105
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.350
But compared to like Lin till the North. Yeah.

106
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.000
<v 0>No. I've had some super, super you're talking about Linton,</v>

107
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.640
fair Rache being like I've really like deep tastes.

108
00:05:38.641 --> 00:05:40.050
I've had shows on that intense.

109
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:44.460
I've had some like the super expensive chocolates are the ones I feel like you

110
00:05:44.461 --> 00:05:45.750
have to do. You're going,

111
00:05:45.751 --> 00:05:49.620
are you going on a battle with taking a bite out of like the premium economy?

112
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.540
It's like have a little bit better than old.

113
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.720
Have you ever had like truly like you go into like a specialist,

114
00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:58.070
chocolate shop kind of shop. It's fun with chocolates. Always give.

115
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.090
<v 1>You like the superintendents, like dark chocolate because that's like, yeah.</v>

116
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.580
And then I eat this and I'm like, yeah, it tastes like Ash.

117
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.930
<v 0>Do my deal. I talk shop. I do.</v>

118
00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.580
<v 1>But there's a limit like, right.</v>

119
00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.060
<v 0>Like it's like 90% cacau. It's just like.</v>

120
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.090
<v 1>Chocolate tier places. And they'll be like, it's amazing. Isn't it?</v>

121
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.440
It's like 80% like a cooker. And then.

122
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.540
<v 2>You're like, yeah, that's great. That's good.</v>

123
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.760
<v 0>Sometimes I have like one bite and then I'm like, Oh,</v>

124
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.870
I got to battle this battle with my mouth. Like trying to get this done, man.

125
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.140
Like I get it.

126
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.470
<v 1>I was having like an espresso or something to go with it.</v>

127
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.640
Like they'll wash each other out and you know, I'll feel happy.

128
00:06:33.641 --> 00:06:36.670
But when you have one bite of super dark chocolate,

129
00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.180
it's stays with you for the rest of the day. You can't,

130
00:06:40.181 --> 00:06:42.250
you cannot get the taste out of your mouth. Yeah.

131
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.390
And I don't want to feel like I've just.

132
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.870
<v 0>I've never thought about having chocolates with like anything else actually.</v>

133
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.540
<v 1>With coffee, it's like the best. Yeah. You got to have it with the coffee.</v>

134
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.100
I don't eat chocolate for that.

135
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.020
<v 0>I don't know. I find it. Cause for me like coffee and tea,</v>

136
00:06:56.021 --> 00:06:58.060
I just liked by itself. I've never tried.

137
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.600
Cause if you dip something into the tea that root, that kind of like changes.

138
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.570
I eat it when you drink it.

139
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.270
<v 1>Like a pallet cleanser. Because like if your mouth two chocolates.</v>

140
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.550
<v 0>Keep eating more. My mom, I want to give that a go then,</v>

141
00:07:09.551 --> 00:07:13.810
because I've never thought to combine the two because I never, yeah.

142
00:07:13.811 --> 00:07:15.060
I never thought about chocolate

143
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:21.100
speakable chocolate was always been a snack for me at a restaurant.

144
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.310
<v 1>It's like a fancy restaurant. There'll be like coffee and dessert. Yeah, yeah.</v>

145
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.153
Yeah.

146
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.680
<v 0>Coffee chocolates. Yeah, because they go together.</v>

147
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.360
It's just like, wow. I didn't think you were supposed to eat all the chocolate.

148
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:38.920
And then your, you telling me chocolates meant to be just a snack.

149
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.380
I'm not just a dessert. Cause that's,

150
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:45.070
I guess that's the way I see your chocolates. It's not like I said, I don't,

151
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:48.660
I never used to snack. It's like it was my dessert, I guess it wasn't.

152
00:07:48.661 --> 00:07:50.350
It was like a full-on I'm either committed.

153
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.850
<v 1>It's very sad to have a chocolate bar and be like, ah, yes, this is my dessert.</v>
