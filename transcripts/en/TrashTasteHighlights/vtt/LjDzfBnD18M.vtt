1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.910
<v 0>I should probably explain what a Tanger is to the audience. I go, Oh yeah.</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.430
Cause YouTube just recently got one. Right? We got,

3
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.830
we've got a joke gift from a friend of ours who gave us a tango,

4
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:12.090
which is just a set. It's just a, it's a branded Fleshlight, Fleshlight. No,

5
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:13.080
a Japanese flesh.

6
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.450
It's a high class flashlights flashlights where I see them make me look

7
00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:20.750
uncomfortable. Like I, sorry. When I see them, I feel uncomfortable.

8
00:00:20.751 --> 00:00:23.630
Like I see it. I'm like, why does it look like that? Why is it?

9
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.580
What's it like donkey Kong is lit. It's disgusting. What is that?

10
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.410
It's so gross. I never heard anyone. Tango's donkey,

11
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.790
stereotypical flashlight. Anyone want to stick their Dick in? Yeah. Yeah.

12
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.160
That's true. You gotta be do that. Yeah, because the thing is,

13
00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:48.950
you know, no one's using like a Fleshlight and own horn.

14
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.160
They actually be looking at it, looking at it to be like, Oh yeah.

15
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.470
I'm like basically a now. You know what I mean?

16
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.690
Like nobody cares what it looks like. I dunno.

17
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.980
I dunno how Tinga managed to make it look normal now they make it look like a,

18
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.950
like a, like an ornament. Yeah. Like a sleek thing.

19
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.510
I don't know if you come to the Japan,

20
00:01:08.511 --> 00:01:11.030
go check it out there and like donkey hotel. Yeah.

21
00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:13.280
So there's like different types of Tenga. There's like,

22
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.140
I remember the first time I heard of it was just tender eggs, which Oh yeah,

23
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.890
yeah, yeah. Which I have never seen them. It's like, it's like, it's like a,

24
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.250
you can get like a half dozen or like a dozen it's like in the natural,

25
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.400
like egg cotton. So, so, so yeah, it's they,

26
00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:30.710
they sell actual egg cartons and there's these Tanger eggs,

27
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.620
which are actually like, I've never, where's wonderful.

28
00:01:33.621 --> 00:01:34.850
Where do you put your Dick in there?

29
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.800
So you have to like crack it open and then it kind of stretches out.

30
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.241
So it's basically,

31
00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:44.920
it's basically just like way where you literally just crack it open on the side,

32
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.240
kind of just do this and it cracks on the side. And then basically like the,

33
00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:51.980
the, the Fleshlight pot is kind of like squashed in.

34
00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:55.190
So you like stretch it out and then you kind of just wrap it up.

35
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.320
Don't ask me how I know that

36
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.600
I've never understood people look Jack off in a socks. What's up with that?

37
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.380
I don't know anyone who drags off in a song, hear it all the time.

38
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.740
I thought that was just an urban legend. One of my university who did it,

39
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.880
he would Jack off into, he had,

40
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.020
he had socks specifically for Jackie carpet on like that.

41
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.600
Like how was that comfortable?

42
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.130
Some reason the thought of using tissue is too much effort or getting in.

43
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.560
It's like rubbing your bed, Dick on the carpet. It's like,

44
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.610
it just sounds like it hurts. Is that helpful? What has happened is that

45
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.530
you get a taste for the, you can't go back because,

46
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.390
but you hear it all the time. Right? It's like the whole like, Oh,

47
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.150
crusty socks kind of thing. I'm just like, ah, you know, that's a funny,

48
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.600
fictional thing that never happened, guy. My one, he would use them,

49
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.990
like he would use did his dirty socks that he could, you know,

50
00:02:50.991 --> 00:02:52.850
when you go to bed, take off your socks. Right.

51
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.550
I would just throw them in his room. Then when he was going to do it,

52
00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:57.460
he would grab one. And then he was like, well, it doesn't matter.

53
00:02:57.461 --> 00:03:00.760
I'm gonna wash it anyway. I'm like, so you're telling me, you're telling me,

54
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.310
look at the straight, you might've played like rugby. You might've gone running.

55
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.690
You would use that shot. And then he literally gave himself his own foot foot.

56
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.290
He gave himself a self foot job, basically. [inaudible],

57
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.280
I'm so sorry to the listeners who are grossed out by this yet. But yeah,

58
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.370
I just couldn't believe it. And I, I was, I've asked people like, do do this.

59
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.170
This is the thing that you do know anyone they're like, yeah.

60
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.450
I know people who know people who do it. And I'm like,

61
00:03:24.451 --> 00:03:26.520
why are you friends with them? What's wrong with you? Yeah.

62
00:03:26.521 --> 00:03:29.100
But what if they're doing like, uh, Oh yeah. A friend of a friend of mine

63
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.050
that I've heard people who have found out like that brothers or like the sister

64
00:03:34.051 --> 00:03:35.910
found that brother doing it. I've heard that. Oh,

65
00:03:35.911 --> 00:03:38.640
that's the worst that's close was walking in your brother.

66
00:03:38.641 --> 00:03:42.940
You see as like shocked. Yeah. Why are they crushing it? Oh my God.

67
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.620
You don't understand how they cause people I've heard of people as well using

68
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.200
the same sock more than once without cleaning it. Yeah.

69
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.760
Do they want to get like a UTI? That's what,

70
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.050
it's just like the speed run any percent to like a sexual transmitted person.

71
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.900
It's like, I don't understand at any percent,

72
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.050
this is like Victorian era syphilis simulator.

73
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.090
Like what is this at which point was the tissue just too like complicated to

74
00:04:06.091 --> 00:04:07.650
figure out a box. They, they,

75
00:04:07.651 --> 00:04:10.590
they're not hard to put on any surface they're flat, you know, just,

76
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.170
or if you can't even do that, just roll of toilet paper, you know,

77
00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:17.820
like that'll also suffice to understand. I mean like dude, aside from like,

78
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.850
apparently wonky into socks of which w which is what we're talking about now.

79
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.830
Do you actually know anyone who owns like a pocket or like got like a non

80
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.890
Tanger? Yeah. Like a non tango. I feel like people don't admit it. I feel like,

81
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.510
I feel like it's probably way more than I realized.

82
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.960
I don't know anyone who's put like, cause they're not telling you,

83
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.310
is it just, is it just a thing that guys just don't tell each other?

84
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.310
Or is it just a thing that guys just don't buy? I don't know.

85
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.670
I think there's a certain shame in admitting that you come into a plastic toy.

86
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.180
I feel as well. Like maybe we were just hanging out with like,

87
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.880
this is not those kinds of people. You know what I mean?

88
00:04:50.881 --> 00:04:53.880
I think it's also because like you said,

89
00:04:53.881 --> 00:04:56.820
they look ugly and it looked weird. Like there's no,

90
00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.970
there's no way that your mom opens a drawer and see, you see,

91
00:04:59.971 --> 00:05:03.750
as it sees like an owner hall or like a pocket puts, you explained that away.

92
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.330
Like, to me in my mind, it has to be like, there's two graphs, right?

93
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.690
There's effort to clean and enjoyment. I get out of it. And I,

94
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.160
so you like midmaxing pocketbooks because the problem is right.

95
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.420
Is that I don't want to clean it.

96
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.100
I don't want anything to do with it when I'm done.

97
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.180
I want it to be done and dusted you get it in a tissue. You throw that away.

98
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.460
Right. It's gone. It's out of my mind. Like,

99
00:05:26.461 --> 00:05:29.910
do I really worst case scenario if I'm really desperate for lube,

100
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.280
for some reason, I'm sure I can just loop up my hand. Right.

101
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.760
But I don't want to make a mess. Um, that is like my priority here.

102
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.430
I just want to get this over with, I'm not trying to have, like,

103
00:05:38.431 --> 00:05:41.490
I'm not lighting candles, you know, accenting the air. Like I don't give a.

104
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.110
I'm just trying to get it done. Turn on the mood light. Like,

105
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.850
I don't understand by who,

106
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.960
like it's enjoyable to them that they're willing to go then to the kitchen,

107
00:05:51.961 --> 00:05:54.450
have the shameful thing and just like, all right, I'm gonna clean out my GEs.

108
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.220
Yeah. I don't want to touch that. I don't want to get,

109
00:05:56.221 --> 00:05:57.290
I don't want to do anything. It,

110
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.590
I could discuss it when I get a little bit on my hand. I'm like, Oh no,

111
00:06:00.591 --> 00:06:04.120
that won't do it. I'll get that off. Some people are just, just don't care, man.

112
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.970
It's just, it's just weird for me. Because like, it seems like it's, you know,

113
00:06:06.971 --> 00:06:10.210
socially acceptable for girls to have like whatever sex, the way they want.

114
00:06:10.211 --> 00:06:12.700
Right. And I mean, you go to, I mean, they sell it on high street stores.

115
00:06:12.701 --> 00:06:16.510
Like in England, we have an summers where you can just go in there and I get it.

116
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.720
It's for a guy it's like, you can do it in like two seconds. Right.

117
00:06:19.721 --> 00:06:22.540
Get it done if you really need to. Right. Yeah. For good.

118
00:06:22.541 --> 00:06:24.100
I guess that takes longer. Right? It's bit harder.

119
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.670
You actually have to like wipe the canvas and turn on the mood lights, right?

120
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.300
Yeah. But I also imagine like fingering yourself is probably, I don't,

121
00:06:30.301 --> 00:06:34.770
I wouldn't know. I bet it's probably a little more difficult. I,

122
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:36.970
to know that the farm is way harder than the pinky. NA

123
00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:48.850
[inaudible] have you done? What fingered myself? Yeah.

124
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.713
No.

125
00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.800
What the did you think of yourself? Something you want to tell us?

126
00:07:02.801 --> 00:07:07.090
[inaudible] have you ever

127
00:07:07.091 --> 00:07:12.091
[

128
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.730
inaudible] Jerry, like my stool broke one time and never been the same.
