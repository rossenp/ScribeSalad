WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.511
<v 0>It's weird. Right?</v>

2
00:00:00.511 --> 00:00:03.480
Because I feel like manga readers just exist in their own bubbles. Right.

3
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.130
Cause when we talk about the anime community,

4
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:09.370
most people refer to it as like the animated Monga community. It's it's we, we,

5
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.200
we kind of, we're kind of,

6
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.530
we're kind of assume that we're just so synonymous with each other. Right.

7
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.880
But then there are times when I just kind of realized that I have no idea what's

8
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:21.540
going on in the Mongo world sometimes. Like there's this recent, uh,

9
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:26.190
there's this airing anime right now called a Hottie Mia. That, uh, so good.

10
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.410
Yeah, exactly. It's exactly. May or may. It may,

11
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.680
Lynn's just like fam the monger, his favorite Mongo

12
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.730
[inaudible] is getting adapted.

13
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:39.370
There was like so many manga readers that they come out, they just come out,

14
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.250
just come out and say, Oh my God, this is my favorite Monga. I love this Mongo.

15
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.010
And here I am thinking where where's this rock?

16
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.600
<v 1>What is this wrong? This is the thing, right.</v>

17
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.790
<v 0>I say six out of 10, but I'm sure they're like me. They're like,</v>

18
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.870
I forget about it. But when the Mo the anime is announced.

19
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.750
<v 1>Yo, yo, that's my favorite. I love that one. I read that ages ago.</v>

20
00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:00.590
I loved that.

21
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.300
<v 0>The thing is I had never heard of Hadi Mia before the anime got adopted this</v>

22
00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:08.210
winter season. Right. And I'm just like, it must be a pretty, like,

23
00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:11.750
it must have like a cult following or something. So search it up. And.

24
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.790
<v 1>Oh, it has a call following. It is.</v>

25
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.350
<v 0>The 13th, most popular Mongo of all time on Miami list.</v>

26
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.450
<v 1>And I'm just like, how will I have, how have I never heard this name before?</v>

27
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.070
Or how's no one discussed this in my presence before reading bad.

28
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.640
Well, that's the thing.

29
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.260
<v 0>What I find so interesting about the Monga wold is that even if it's like</v>

30
00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.210
universally praised and credited as being this most amazing piece of work right

31
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:39.044
in the Mongo wall,

32
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.550
it's just really surprising how few people in the enemy community actually know

33
00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:48.170
about it. Like I guaran T not many people know about like me Puente food,

34
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.860
even though I think it's like the second or third highest rated Mongo on Val,

35
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.840
I feel like, I feel like, I dunno some like sane in Monga. You,

36
00:01:55.841 --> 00:01:59.600
you have like the sane in big four. I think you have like, Binland saga.

37
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.220
<v 1>Always the big numbers. It is because it's not quite the meeting.</v>

38
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.630
[inaudible] to the top. That, that, that describes things pretty well.

39
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.530
Nevermind.

40
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.710
<v 0>We should rename it. [inaudible]</v>

41
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.300
It might be, it might be three. I can't remember. Cause it's it's all.

42
00:02:20.301 --> 00:02:24.590
Which ones are you referring to? The crowd that always talk about Binland saga.

43
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.660
It's either villain saga, berserk, or a Camry.

44
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.310
Vagabond. Vagabond. Yeah. I think there's one more.

45
00:02:34.311 --> 00:02:38.960
That is in that genre that everyone keeps savy golden. Calmly. No,

46
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.840
that's not going Camry, but maybe it's just a big three. Maybe,

47
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.300
maybe I'm just imagining things. But like,

48
00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:48.380
I feel like a lot of sane in Monga gets talked about as like these masterpieces,

49
00:02:48.381 --> 00:02:52.160
you know what I mean? But some like slice of life, romance, Monga,

50
00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:54.920
like Hardy Mia that is apparently very popular,

51
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.440
just don't get talked about in the same sphere.

52
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.000
And I would argue that even the big, the big three scene,

53
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:03.940
and I guess we've coined it now, like Bailey had told us about light.

54
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.500
It upsets me how few people know about like valuable. Really? Yeah.

55
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.730
I feel like a lot of people know.

56
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.660
<v 1>About. Yeah. That's awesome.</v>

57
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.100
I know it is a title that exists. I know. Absolutely nothing.

58
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.900
<v 0>Think about it. So vagabond essentially is a it's a samurai Mongo. Yeah,</v>

59
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.380
but I would, but it's done by, uh, the author who did slammed.

60
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.690
<v 1>On. Oh, okay. That sounds cool. So you.</v>

61
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.570
<v 0>Know where somehow not only my has to make one of the greatest sports market</v>

62
00:03:30.571 --> 00:03:32.100
ever made, but also one of the greatest salmon.

63
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.050
<v 1>Yeah. It's amazing. Okay. How many chapters is it? It's still going.</v>

64
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.510
It's still ongoing, but it's on hiatus.

65
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.740
<v 0>I dunno what it is about this, you know, the,</v>

66
00:03:42.741 --> 00:03:47.730
the brutal scene in Mongo where they get up to like 200 or 300 chapters in the

67
00:03:47.731 --> 00:03:49.380
officious, like I'm ahead of that.

68
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.250
<v 1>Yeah. I'll take a break. I think I, the Monga I've read,</v>

69
00:03:53.251 --> 00:03:56.340
it feels like they build up like a really cool world. And again, they just like,

70
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.220
it either gets too big and they're just like, right, right. To reign this in.

71
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.840
Or like, it just gets way too big. And it ends with like so many things. Not.

72
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.850
<v 0>I explored because going back to Hunter Hunter,</v>

73
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.550
like it got up to a point where I'm just like, this is a,

74
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.220
this is a comfortable place to end it. You know what I mean?

75
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.820
<v 1>It's a comfortable place to like, yeah, no, it definitely.</v>

76
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.360
<v 0>Could have ended it. And then she introduces the dark continent,</v>

77
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.800
which without spoiling the exact details of it is so you have,

78
00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:24.990
you have the ones that we're going to see the end of it. You have this,

79
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.890
you have this world, that's a gushy buildup in Hunter Hunter. Right.

80
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.980
And it was like, how, how long was like the it, whatever,

81
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.940
the 148 episodes, 148 episodes. Right.

82
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.720
And it ended to a point where you explored everything you needed to explore

83
00:04:39.721 --> 00:04:42.570
about the world. Right. And he went on hiatus and everyone was just like, Oh,

84
00:04:42.571 --> 00:04:45.000
you know, Hunter, Hunter must be coming to an end. Right.

85
00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:48.000
And then he comes back and he's just like, JK, by the way,

86
00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:50.130
this is just one fifth of the way.

87
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.760
<v 1>Well, that's, I hate it when they do that, man, like, don't,</v>

88
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.500
don't come here and pull it out of your.

89
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.350
It's like a like iPhone presentation. It's like, but wait, okay.

90
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.710
There's more, it's like, wait, but no salt.

91
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.370
It shouldn't be as cool as the idea is of like expanding the world.

92
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.760
It's honestly one of the things that makes me roll my eyes, emotion.

93
00:05:11.761 --> 00:05:15.900
I've been reading Monga lately, but there's another constant or planet.

94
00:05:15.901 --> 00:05:16.734
And I'm like, Oh, for,

95
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.600
there is not going to be another planet that has gotta be satisfied.

96
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.600
<v 0>Yeah. That's, that's exactly how I felt when like, uh.</v>

97
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.850
<v 1>You know, in like dragon ball, when they started expanding on like,</v>

98
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.373
[inaudible] like, bro.

99
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.560
<v 0>Like I don't like blowing up planets and like taking over the universe was hard</v>

100
00:05:34.561 --> 00:05:37.290
enough. And now it's like, well, uh, you know,

101
00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:39.630
there's like seven more universes out there that we can explore.

102
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.100
<v 1>Nothing gets my job,</v>

103
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.960
like softer than hearing multi-verse or like expanding the universe out of

104
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.470
like.

105
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.820
<v 0>One thing I hate the most is how, like,</v>

106
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.910
I don't mind them like introducing that kind of thing. If they actually.

107
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.990
<v 1>Followed through with it, they'll just, and like a chapter, they'll be like, Oh,</v>

108
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.360
by the way, there's other worlds. No, there wasn't. There was never,

109
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.840
you never made this mango with other worlds in mind, you liar,

110
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.280
you're adding this now. Cause like, okay,

111
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.610
sorry to bring it up again for like the ninth tie.

112
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.610
But like w what I was reading Claymore, they just casually mentioned that like,

113
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.330
there's two worlds having a wall and then it's like never brought up again.

114
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.670
And then they just itch. It ends.

115
00:06:18.671 --> 00:06:20.680
And we never hit anything about the other world.

116
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.320
That's apparently having a war and it's like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.

117
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.520
So everyone gets to go low and happy. But the whole,

118
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.960
why this world exist is because there was a war and this is like a testing.

119
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.320
It's really. Like, I don't, I don't like it when they do this,

120
00:06:32.321 --> 00:06:35.200
especially when the Monga is like, you know,

121
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.070
it's been going on for a long time and it already feels like it's stretching

122
00:06:39.071 --> 00:06:42.100
thin. And then they'll like another world, baby. It's like, no, no, no, no, no.

123
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.610
Because I think you said if they build it up fine, but when they just drop it,

124
00:06:45.611 --> 00:06:46.444
I hate it.

125
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.410
<v 0>You sometimes see these plot points in Monga. It's just like dropped.</v>

126
00:06:50.411 --> 00:06:53.620
And for some reason you just never, ever hear about it. Again,

127
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.240
like aside from other worlds,

128
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.320
the biggest example I can think of is the Gantz Monga. Oh my God.

129
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.870
<v 1>Well, I love that one, but I was so dumb. Yeah.</v>

130
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.250
<v 0>I just like,</v>

131
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.240
remember when there were vampires in it and that was a big plot points.

132
00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.100
<v 1>And then they just disappeared. Just never heard about it again.</v>

133
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.850
There's a lot of stuff in jail. So if you haven't read Gans, I guess you could,

134
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:20.170
uh, it's very long. It's red. The artwork is amazing. We spoke about it before,

135
00:07:20.171 --> 00:07:21.850
but yeah, randomly, halfway through,

136
00:07:21.851 --> 00:07:24.370
they introduced vampires into a world that never had vampires.

137
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.640
And then they just never come up again. Not gonna lie.

138
00:07:27.641 --> 00:07:31.060
Like I barely remember any of it because I think at that point I kind of just

139
00:07:31.061 --> 00:07:33.820
like erased it from my mind. I was like, this is so dumb.

140
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.860
I don't even want to like potato. It's a memory.

141
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.920
<v 0>I just kind of, I always offhand remember edge, you know,</v>

142
00:07:38.921 --> 00:07:39.850
sometimes you just get flat.

143
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:42.790
<v 1>I wake up at night sweating. Yeah. You wake up, there was grandpa.</v>

144
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.370
<v 0>You wake up and you're just like, whatever happened to those vampires,</v>

145
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.350
what did they disappear? They were built up.

146
00:07:47.351 --> 00:07:50.590
That's like the big villains or something. And then they just,

147
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:51.880
they just went nowhere with it.
