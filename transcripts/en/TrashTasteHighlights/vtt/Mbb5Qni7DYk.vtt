00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.000
<v 0>All right. Well, I can't believe I'm about to tell this story. You go, Oh God,</v>

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.450
I don't even remember how old I was. This is easy. It was, it was, I remember,

3
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.130
I don't remember exactly how old it was,

4
00:00:10.131 --> 00:00:15.020
but it was around that age as a teenager. When you first discovered porn, right?

5
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.400
Anyway, between life, I don't know, 13 to 15, something like that.

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.200
Maybe even early for some people, I don't know, but a pebble what it was to,

7
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.300
I think it was legitimately the first time I watched like a hand tie on my

8
00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:32.520
computer. Right. And you went straight to hand-tight even watch it.

9
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.050
This was like, this was like, not long after I discovered porn.

10
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.620
He quickly got down that rabbit hole. Yeah, no like that,

11
00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:42.680
that first time I hit the first time with him,

12
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.460
Ty was a different story and I was in my room and like, my room has like,

13
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.350
had a lock on it. Sorry. I thought I blocked the door. Oh,

14
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.640
Oh. And my thought. And I remember, I remember as well, we chant, I was,

15
00:00:55.641 --> 00:01:00.110
it was a commercial Collegeville, Kalamazoo. Oh, classic classic. Right.

16
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.970
Classic. It's like next to libel black classic. Right. And uh,

17
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.100
and yeah, so I was like, Oh, something has a Rosen in me.

18
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.210
[inaudible] right. My, my little Joey has, has woke now. Right.

19
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.920
So I was like, let's give it a go. And so I did it. And then, uh,

20
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.813
I hear like a,

21
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.890
a clock of the door opening and I had looked around and it's my dad standing

22
00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:33.540
there. He's pretty, he's pretty proud of you there. Oh,

23
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.640
he looked at me and he looked at what was on my screen and he looked at me again

24
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.380
and he just said really mad.

25
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.600
That seems like the most Australian man alive. He just said, I remember exactly.

26
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.490
Wait, what'd he say, he's like, really mate couldn't have been regular.

27
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.060
I wouldn't, I wouldn't even be disappointed with you. It was just regular porn.

28
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.990
And I was like, I mean, I've been past that point.

29
00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:03.230
I was kind of we've experimented. And he's like, all right, whatever. Like,

30
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.590
I don't know why. I don't know what had,

31
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.570
I have already gotten bored of regular porn. I'm seeking new adventures.

32
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.780
I could legitimately see the very moment where the disappointment came.

33
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.860
You know what I mean? It's like, it's like,

34
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:19.850
it's like a certain look in my dad's eyes where it kind of went from like, Whoa,

35
00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:24.650
what are you doing to, Oh, no, he's into that. He's into that.

36
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.160
Huh? Oh yes. Father. I am into that. Oh, you winning

37
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.140
[inaudible] and now I talk about it for a job. So yeah.

38
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.040
I hope you're proud of me, dad, that felt so desperate.

39
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.880
Please love me please. I'm winning now.

40
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.290
I'm finally winning dad. It's just that that moment is carved into you.

41
00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:54.170
And you're like, you're like the son who just looks for your dad's approval.

42
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.190
I don't have a lot of like distinct memories during my childhood,

43
00:02:58.191 --> 00:03:01.300
but that was definitely one that will like forever stick with me.

44
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:05.680
Like I it's kind of just implanted itself into the back of my brain. Yeah.

45
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.540
Now I don't know.

46
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.150
I've I've never been caught jacking off at all because to me it's like, if,

47
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:14.890
if I do this, a checklist happens 100 for me. It's it's,

48
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.550
it's, it's the same one. My snake. Unfortunately, it's it's the same one.

49
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.040
You know, you leave the house and you have your okay. Pat keys, wallet, phone,

50
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.640
same thing. Same thing. When, when you do the same thing, same thing, you know,

51
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.690
you do, you do the deed and you just like ahead door locks,

52
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.530
headphones on or whatever. Make sure nobody's in the house or nobody can hear.

53
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.760
And then you start see it with the lock on my door.

54
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:41.490
I got a little too overconfident. So I'm like, yeah, this is this full proof.

55
00:03:41.491 --> 00:03:44.250
Isn't it. And then I just, I guess I just forgot, you know, what it felt like,

56
00:03:44.251 --> 00:03:44.851
it felt like, you know,

57
00:03:44.851 --> 00:03:49.110
when you're playing Pokemon and you like go into a cave and you put repel on and

58
00:03:49.111 --> 00:03:53.400
it runs out just before, you're about to leave and you get into an encounter.

59
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.940
That's what it felt like. I was like, I wasn't that close,

60
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.150
but I don't know. Like, I've like, I thought getting walked in on.

61
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.660
Right? Yeah. It's like a common thing. Cause you see it so much on the internet.

62
00:04:06.661 --> 00:04:10.020
Right. It's like, I go, like, what do I do? You know, that kind of stuff.

63
00:04:10.021 --> 00:04:13.650
So have you ever walked in on anyone or been walked in on? Oh my gosh.

64
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.520
Maybe I have, I don't know. I feel like these are like buried memories. Yeah.

65
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.170
That's pretty a good chance. I've pretty walked. I dunno.

66
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.690
I've been to parties and seen, but like people just don't care.

67
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.010
They're just like having like a private time, you know? No,

68
00:04:29.011 --> 00:04:31.480
I don't think I have actually, no. Yeah. I,

69
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.210
I think I've never walked in on someone,

70
00:04:33.211 --> 00:04:37.410
but the closest I've come is it was union university. You know, it was, uh,

71
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.690
visiting a mate and it was like a group house.

72
00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:41.790
So like two or three of them mate. So there,

73
00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:43.740
and we were getting ready for the night out.

74
00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:47.910
So I was just like saying hello to everyone. And then, um, I knock on this,

75
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.970
I knock on one of my mates door and I, you know,

76
00:04:50.971 --> 00:04:55.010
that panic scramble that you can hear. So there's doors locked. Right. But I,

77
00:04:55.011 --> 00:04:57.390
I knocked on the door and all I heard was

78
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.430
what I was doing. Honestly, that's all I heard. Right.

79
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.660
And then he opens the door and the laptop, which is opposites,

80
00:05:09.661 --> 00:05:14.160
like where the door is, is conveniently closed. So I'm just like,

81
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.550
Oh, he's just doing. And it was like nothing. I was just, uh,

82
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.470
just working on my presentation, you know,

83
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.480
but I've never actually walked in on anyone,

84
00:05:24.481 --> 00:05:29.460
but I feel like it's more common in America because in university there,

85
00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:32.850
if you share a room that's, this is why I can't imagine weird to me.

86
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.810
This is why I can't imagine having a roommate. Right. Because how would you,

87
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.960
how would you schedule that? Anyone in America? Can you ask me, do you guys,

88
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.540
do you actually have to schedule your sessions?

89
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.090
Because when do you have to be like, where are you going?

90
00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:48.900
How long will you be out legend coming back, urban legend.

91
00:05:48.901 --> 00:05:52.350
Where do you tell each other? Where do you like Gigi?

92
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.680
Do you like have like a calendar where you schedule it? Okay guys. Okay.

93
00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.060
So this, this time is my time. There's going to be a sock on the door.

94
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.570
That's how you know, and if the sock is on the door,

95
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.310
then it is like code red. Don't come in. Never me during my time.
