[inaudible] vanilla is a flavor that needs to exist. And I have that. All right,

10
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:45.360
let's go from top left to bottom. Right? We have monster from the new world.

11
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.610
We've done a prince summer Jojo vampire night,

12
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.790
golden Camry story of [inaudible] Soares. And

13
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.620
[inaudible] do you want to explain yourself Malin? Yeah, especially,

14
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.180
this is literally, I like the true crime. This is

15
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.590
isn't it. It is. Yeah. You got Joe Joe's monster. And then you've got all that.

16
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:12.420
Like I've.

17
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.180
<v 1>Watched all of these at least two or two to five times</v>

18
00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:17.630
each.

19
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.990
<v 0>Yeah. You, you wouldn't did not influence her.</v>

20
00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:23.930
She's thought of the same thing where it's the shows you rewatch and the shows

21
00:01:23.931 --> 00:01:27.440
you just speak it back to, because I've heard mainly in talking about monster,

22
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.950
we've done a prince summer Jojo golden Camry. She's the guy already.

23
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.230
It's the bottom three, then I'm curious. Huh?

24
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.100
<v 1>Well, most of my body pillows are the hock location.</v>

25
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.790
<v 0>Okay. Let, let, let me preface that. I think out of, out of all of us,</v>

26
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.470
Malin owns more body pillows. Then the three of us put together. How.

27
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.510
<v 1>Many do you want right now in Japan?</v>

28
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.870
Including in the U S how many do you want? Like 50, but hold on, hold on there.

29
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.850
They're not all big body pillows.

30
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.600
We're not the number five zero.

31
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.580
Cause I do have like.

32
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.150
<v 0>Key chain. I need to clean up the gins for you.</v>

33
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.670
Degeneracy has come a long.

34
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.451
<v 1>Way. I haven't, you know,</v>

35
