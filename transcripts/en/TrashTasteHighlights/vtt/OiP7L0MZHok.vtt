1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.950
<v 0>It's like, you go go completely on a tangent.</v>

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.650
That's all I completely feel about gender reveal parties.

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.860
<v 1>Like I don't, I don't.</v>

4
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.110
<v 0>Understand the point of gender reveal.</v>

5
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.670
So many like absurd gender robot, gender reveal,

6
00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:17.190
party clips on like tic-tac and stuff like that, where I'm just like,

7
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.330
this is just hilarious. Now, did you see the one where it's like, what was it?

8
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.680
It was like, there was like a balloon, like a giant balloon. Like, you know,

9
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:28.320
maybe like this is the weirdest tangent we've ever done.

10
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.140
<v 1>Because what I was, what I was thinking was like.</v>

11
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.100
<v 0>No, it's just going to say, like, there's just like a giant, like six,</v>

12
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:38.580
seven foot balloon that this guy carries. And he's just like, all right,

13
00:00:38.581 --> 00:00:42.030
I'm going to pop it. And it just explodes into this like colored,

14
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:43.980
like powder that just completely.

15
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.190
<v 1>Fills up the backyard. No, cause what.</v>

16
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.490
<v 0>I'm thinking right is okay.</v>

17
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:51.840
The point of gender reveal party is to reveal the gender of the baby. Right.

18
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.400
And celebrate that. But like at which point do do,

19
00:00:56.401 --> 00:01:00.590
does like agenda get revealed and the father is just like, oh, it's it's.

20
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.800
<v 1>It's a girl. Oh, Karen, Karen,</v>

21
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.650
get the guy, go get the coat hanger. We're doing it again. Like what,

22
00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:09.271
what kind of,

23
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:13.140
what kind of reaction do you expect the father and the mother to have?

24
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.520
You know what I mean, human, most normal people will be like,

25
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.730
whether it's a guy or a girl, the reaction's going to be the same.

26
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.660
<v 2>I just think that we celebrate too many things.</v>

27
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.690
I think we have enough things to celebrate the.

28
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.370
<v 0>Hardest to just say, it's a boy.</v>

29
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.660
<v 2>Like how hard is it? It's like having the kids birthday. Like not enough.</v>

30
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.590
Like I think to me, I legitimately don't understand,

31
00:01:36.591 --> 00:01:39.170
like we have so many things to celebrate. It's exhausting.

32
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.310
Who is planning all this. Like who has this much free time. Honestly,

33
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.440
I barely can like get Christmas plans together. Like who has this?

34
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.980
Is it the woman she's pregnant? Shouldn't you be focused on that? Like I don't.

35
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.000
I know. I.

36
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.730
<v 0>Wonder if there's like self fulfilling prophecy of why some people working in</v>

37
00:01:55.731 --> 00:01:57.980
retail in America, when a person comes in and being like,

38
00:01:57.981 --> 00:01:59.420
give me all of your blue dye.

39
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.200
<v 1>I need as much blue dye as possible on my way. Oh. All right.</v>

40
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.890
Another one of these. All right. But yeah, back to attack one tight

41
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.380
[inaudible] on the line. Stop.

42
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.570
<v 0>Complaining about time on time. It's good.</v>

43
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.330
<v 2>I just felt like, I just feel like it's like, cause you know,</v>

44
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.090
I think it's of edge, edge, edgy people out there who are just like,

45
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.180
I don't want to admit that attacker type is the best thing right now. Yeah.

46
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.390
I don't want to give it more clout than it deserves. And you know,

47
00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:32.390
you see these God awful takes on Twitter being like, yeah, it was boring.

48
00:02:32.391 --> 00:02:34.370
Dropped it right away. And it's like, who cares?

49
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:37.610
Just let the people who are enjoying it. enjoy it. Yeah. It's good.

50
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.880
<v 0>That's the thing it's like, you can have, you can have an opinion about it,</v>

51
00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:44.480
right? Like if you think get, whatever. Don't harass the animators over it.

52
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.710
Yeah.

53
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.900
<v 2>It's the same thing with like when game of Thrones is like around people. Like,</v>

54
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.090
you know, people just want to be that person. Who's like, yeah.

55
00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:53.240
I don't like game of Thrones. Yeah. Whatever. You're happy about it.

56
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.340
That's lame, bro. I'm not excited about it.

57
00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:57.800
I'm more excited about anything except for my gender reveal party.

58
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.350
One thing I get excited for is my baby's gender like that. You know what I mean?

59
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.800
Like I don't know. Yeah. For some reason, you know,

60
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.450
I mean it does happen in other genres as well, but for some reason who are,

61
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.940
these aren't even know the ads of these creators.

62
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:16.870
That's what are they finding this? Why, why are they finding the? Just to it up.

63
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.993
Tell them that.

64
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.820
<v 0>As if like one of the enemies is going to be like, oh, thanks for your feedback.</v>

65
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.713
We'll change it immediately.

66
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.120
<v 2>They go to the, they go to the annual meeting like yo guys,</v>

67
00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:26.280
you see people don't like it. What the?

68
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.540
<v 0>Yeah. So like, uh, Mikasa two 76 on Twitter said that we should,</v>

69
00:03:30.541 --> 00:03:33.630
we should just completely change the episode. It just changed studios.

70
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.330
Like what? Director's going to be like RFM. I've got you. I mean,

71
00:03:36.331 --> 00:03:37.920
it kind of sucks that, you know,

72
00:03:37.921 --> 00:03:41.310
in the time where the Japanese industry and the Japanese staff members are

73
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.880
starting to, you know, we want them to open up to,

74
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.040
to open up more to the international community.

75
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.370
This is the they have to deal with for some of like the biggest profile

76
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.490
adaptation. I want to just go out there.

77
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.350
<v 1>And be like, don't open up. It's not worth it. Don't go. Don't go to school.</v>

78
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.430
<v 2>I do think, you know,</v>

79
00:03:56.431 --> 00:03:59.130
there's a good amount of the people who are probably sending hate who probably

80
00:03:59.131 --> 00:04:02.730
don't want it to open up to them. I think it's, you know,

81
00:04:02.731 --> 00:04:05.280
it's the same thing with like the idol and like kind of almost like the whole

82
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.780
life fan base a little bit where they're like,

83
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.290
we don't want all our people to interact outside, ruined them.

84
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.120
<v 0>We don't want the normies. We don't want, we don't. Yeah.</v>

85
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.230
We don't want like the, the.

86
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.470
<v 2>American corporations getting their fingers in our Japanese, like animate,</v>

87
00:04:16.471 --> 00:04:18.240
you know what I mean? There's a lot of people who are like that, right.

88
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.930
As if they're Japanese, themselves. I mean, they bought at the time,

89
00:04:21.931 --> 00:04:26.280
it does come from a place of, you know, not the Japanese. We like.

90
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.600
<v 1>Don't talk to me, edit if they were Japanese, but most, if not all of them.</v>

91
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.200
So it's like in.

92
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.700
<v 2>Your video, when you did the, uh,</v>

93
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.440
the anime studio tour and like the guy who was the director of the studio,

94
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.600
it was like, oh we have foreign fans. Yeah.

95
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.220
<v 0>I like Kayla genuinely. Yeah.</v>

96
00:04:41.221 --> 00:04:44.820
So the CEO of Clover wars genuinely didn't know that they had, I mean,

97
00:04:44.821 --> 00:04:46.370
a lot of people don't know that.

98
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.400
<v 2>If he goes on 20, 20 I'm neck, should I tell him to kill himself?</v>

99
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.680
I would be like, no, they don't exist.

100
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.910
Don't they don't honestly like it's embarrassing.

101
00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.480
<v 1>It make you feel better. I mean, if you.</v>

102
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.470
<v 0>Think about it, it's the same way. It's the same mentality of like, for example,</v>

103
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.800
if we found out that trash status or something had Japanese fans,

104
00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:10.350
you know what I mean? It's just like, oh, there's people in Japan who watch.

105
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.700
<v 2>We have Russian fonts. I have a Russian dump what's going on.</v>

106
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:18.360
I get emails every week. I'm like, you guys know you have like a Russian doll.

107
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.570
We never spoke about it. Yeah. We get it.
