00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.210
<v 0>So, how are you enjoying your Christmas holiday boys? Well,</v>

2
00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:06.380
that's when we're recording this breakfast,

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.480
we are recording this during the Christmas holiday, 20,

4
00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:10.820
20 we've we've had our Christmas yeah. Episodes,

5
00:00:10.821 --> 00:00:13.400
but we are enjoying our Christmas holidays right now,

6
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.630
even though we're still technically working.

7
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.120
<v 1>I think I took two days off and then I was like, right.</v>

8
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.410
A whole two days back to it, then back to YouTube. I don't know.

9
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.070
I really, I even like going one day without YouTube. I'm like,

10
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.550
I want to do something. Like, I want to make something I want to entertain.

11
00:00:28.551 --> 00:00:31.670
I want to be a clown. I don't know why you're a clown every day. It's all right.

12
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.180
It's pretty, some deep insecurity that happened during my childhood.

13
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.780
It makes me strive to want to entertain. I don't know why, but yeah,

14
00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:41.120
I don't know. It was nice. It was fun. I it's nice having,

15
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.590
I think the difference between like a holiday that is everyone's holiday

16
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.590
and one that you set for yourself is that when it's like, uh,

17
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.210
like a national holiday, you're like, well, I have to, I guess like obligated.

18
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.400
Yeah. Yeah. But then sometimes, you know, you're, you're not your head space is,

19
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.500
and then it's, you're like, man, I kind of want to take a vacation, but like,

20
00:00:57.501 --> 00:00:59.570
I don't want to, but then when, if you do it yourself,

21
00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:01.910
you hype yourself up for it. You're like I'm taking this time off. No,

22
00:01:01.911 --> 00:01:03.680
one's going to tell me what to do. But on Christmas you're like,

23
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.560
I kind of want to, like, I don't like make a video. I'm like, around.

24
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.500
<v 0>It was by the Christmas holidays. I've well,</v>

25
00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:12.650
I've always ended up working during the Christmas holidays because I've had my

26
00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:16.120
yearly videos that probably won't happen this year, but that's probably,

27
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.430
that's mostly what I'm working on during the Christmas holidays. Um,

28
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.840
and then I realized that, you know, as YouTube as you used to take a break,

29
00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:28.730
right. And it feels, I don't know what it is, but do you ever get,

30
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.940
you know, sometimes we take breaks during the weekdays, right? To us.

31
00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:33.980
We don't like weekends don't technically exist,

32
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:38.960
but I've found that taking breaks on the weekends feels a lot better than

33
00:01:38.961 --> 00:01:40.850
taking breaks in during the weekdays,

34
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:44.910
because it just feels nice when you know that everyone else in the country and

35
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.180
on the break as well, you know, most

36
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.100
Christmas days, just a regular word. Yeah. Yeah.

37
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.540
<v 1>And also weekends are a suggestion to stop working. They're not enforced.</v>

38
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.520
<v 0>Every holidays is a suggestion to some working. Let's be honest to,</v>

39
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.350
uh, to the North of Japan for about three or four days to go see Chris. Um,

40
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.940
and that was really nice. There's so much.

41
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.370
<v 1>Snow that you make you drink sacking.</v>

42
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.910
<v 0>Uh, no, he made me drink good sock. Oh yeah.</v>

43
00:02:13.911 --> 00:02:17.060
And also that's an oxymoron for Connor also.

44
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.500
It was the first I did like a proper Japanese Christmas, AKA KFC.

45
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.630
How was it? This is Katie. I, this is just exactly what I thought.

46
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.300
It's just chicken. Like, it's just like a trip to KA.

47
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.860
Although it was kind of weird because Chris had to schedule it like

48
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.890
or book it. Well, KFC, KFC.

49
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.000
We world come to like two, well,

50
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:45.470
three weeks in advance. Right. And it's also wait, it's not just like, uh,

51
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.940
you not only have to book it,

52
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.110
but you have to book like a day in time to go and pick it off as well.

53
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.501
So it's like,

54
00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:54.860
not only do you have to come in on debt on a certain date to a certain store,

55
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:59.410
but it's like come between a two to 3:00 PM time bracket and this,

56
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:02.410
and we went there when there was just like a group of about maybe like five or

57
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:06.100
six families just lining up to get their Christmas chicken from the kernel and.

58
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.740
<v 1>Dive in lineup for a case. Yeah.</v>

59
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.180
<v 0>And I mean, you know,</v>

60
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.380
it was like what we got like a full bucket of like just a bunch of chicken wings.

61
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.543
<v 1>As you do.</v>

62
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.490
<v 0>But also at the bottom of the bucket,</v>

63
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.540
there was like this kind of Christmas cake or like Christmas pudding. Right.

64
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.730
I don't know. Cause I don't think anyone had a slice of it,

65
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.370
but it was at the bottom of the thing. And we're like, Oh,

66
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:31.060
that's a little weird that it's just been sitting underneath this like greasy,

67
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:34.540
greasy, chicken and no way you'd want to put a cake.

68
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.650
It was the last thing we were expecting at the bottom of the bucket to be fair.

69
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.590
And it was like 5,000 yen for it.

70
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:44.170
And it could feed maybe about three or four people.

71
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.510
You paid 50 bucks for KFC on Christmas. Oh my God. I mean, I didn't Kristin,

72
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.460
you could've had a nice roast dinner for that.

73
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.020
We ordered all the food just because it was the first time for all of us.

74
00:03:56.021 --> 00:03:58.930
We've never had a Japanese Christmas before, so we're like, you know what, it.

75
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.710
Let's do it. And uh, wouldn't do it again. To be honest, it's just,

76
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.430
it's just KFC. Cause the thing is like, this is,

77
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:11.020
I think the fourth year that I've been in Asia celebrating Christmas and I got

78
00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:14.650
to say, I, you don't really understand the entire,

79
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.460
the entire like hype behind this. Uh, th th the Christmas spirit,

80
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.610
I thought that was just like, uh, I thought that was just a meme.

81
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.940
It's a marketing point. I didn't,

82
00:04:23.941 --> 00:04:27.430
I didn't understand that until I started spending Christmas outside of,

83
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.480
you know, where, you know, countries that normally celebrate Christmas and,

84
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.280
you know, you can do a lot of things to make it feel Christmas week,

85
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.580
but having spent a few Christmases Christmases in Asia,

86
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.060
I kind of missed that Christmas spirit because there's, there's a few things,

87
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:46.150
you know, you can put on the Christmas songs and you can do every, you know,

88
00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:48.460
put up the tree, but there's just something missing.

89
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.420
I can't put my finger on it, but it just doesn't feel fully Christmasy.

90
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.270
I think it just has to do with the fact that at least in Japan,

91
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:59.200
Christmas is not a family thing. It's like a romantic thing.

92
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.700
And also everyone's working. So it's like, like I got a delivery on like,

93
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.130
as we were having our roast dinner and it was like the least,

94
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.570
it was like the immersion breaking Christmas moment where simulation ruined it.

95
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.080
I had an Amazon package and I was like, this is not Christmas.

96
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.580
<v 1>So the door on your red hat, like I refuse to have this.</v>

97
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.370
<v 0>The wine in hand, Christmas simulation over.</v>

98
00:05:20.371 --> 00:05:22.890
It was like that Rick and Morty episode where you just trapped in an alternate,

99
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.110
like, like this, this like reality.

100
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:27.300
<v 1>Is it like, to me,</v>

101
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.930
Christmas is like going back and reluctantly having to talk to family members

102
00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:34.500
about like, Oh, I do YouTube. You know, this is what I get naked online.

103
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.130
Something like that.

104
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.570
<v 0>Yes. I make this much per year.</v>

105
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.670
Thank you uncle for asking me another seven times.

106
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.200
<v 1>You're investing. Right. And a pension, right? Yes. Yes I am. No, I don't know.</v>

107
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.650
Yeah.

108
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.200
<v 0>I don't know. It felt, it felt odd because I feel like normally.</v>

109
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.440
<v 1>I didn't, I didn't appreciate Christmas that much. Cause I didn't realize it.</v>

110
00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:51.690
It was a really good way of like in my head, at least,

111
00:05:51.691 --> 00:05:54.330
I don't know if this is because I've been, this is how I taught. It was like,

112
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.770
this is the end of the year. Yeah.

113
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.250
Now go and restart and then build up to all of this.

114
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.180
<v 0>Cause it was, it was, it's not just Christmas.</v>

115
00:06:01.181 --> 00:06:03.850
It's that period between Christmas, Christmas and new years.

116
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.900
That is just like the blank period where it's just like, what rules,

117
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.230
what are the rules? Nobody knows what's going on. Or the buses running.

118
00:06:11.231 --> 00:06:15.280
I don't know. I shops open. It's anarchy.

119
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.080
And I love that period because it's.

120
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.940
<v 1>Cool. How, how long can I have leftovers for how many Christmas dinners?</v>

121
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.420
<v 0>Yeah. That's that, that was like living in England.</v>

122
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.720
That was like one of my favorite parts of the year. It was just,

123
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.660
it was just like you said, like the reset of the, it was like the entire,

124
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.420
the entire society was just kind of goes into cool-down.

125
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.940
Whereas here it's like businesses just like supermarkets and convenience stores

126
00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:42.850
are open literally 24, seven, even on new year's day.

127
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.840
<v 1>My mum wants, shut off about KFC Christmas. To me, she's fascinated by it.</v>

128
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.530
She's like, I heard they have KFC for Christmas. This is true. And I'm like,

129
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.490
yes, they do mum. I was like, wow, how crazy is that? And I'm like, yeah,

130
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.380
it's kind of weird to be fair. It is bizarre when you think that is weird.

131
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:00.400
It's like, you know,

132
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:05.290
just all the things that Japan has no interest in from like the West, right.

133
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.050
When we bring our finest things, I like none of them, none of that,

134
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.320
none of that. And then suddenly the curdle rocks up and he's like, listen,

135
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:12.820
how about, let me pitch you this

136
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.610
[inaudible] let me take this. Absolutely nothing to do with Christmas food.

137
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.480
And somehow make it Christmas food who did like, Oh my God, like, how did,

138
00:07:22.481 --> 00:07:24.940
how did they pull this off? Like, I'm sure someone knows the history behind it.

139
00:07:24.941 --> 00:07:27.310
But like, to me, even if you explained to me how it was done,

140
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.360
the KFC marketing department did this, explain it to you last time.

141
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:33.250
But even then it still doesn't make sense to me.

142
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.860
<v 0>I researched it and it doesn't make sense.</v>

143
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.680
Like it was like the marketing heist of the century. I swear to God.
