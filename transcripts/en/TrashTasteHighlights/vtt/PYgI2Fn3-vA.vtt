WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.370
<v 0>I think, I think the creative, they,</v>

2
00:00:01.371 --> 00:00:04.710
they obviously trust that creative people at Nintendo and they obviously let

3
00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:09.450
them do the crazy ideas. Like they released the Mario cart like AI. Uh,

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.710
did you see that, like at your own Aussie calls with cameras in them?

5
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.860
<v 1>Oh no. I saw that. I saw that rock and it's so cool.</v>

6
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.813
And I didn't have a set of people.

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.400
<v 0>Do this cause I don't have to live in rooms. I actually, I actually,</v>

8
00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:23.930
I actually do, but I mean, most people,

9
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.280
I also the thought of having to put a track down and then.

10
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.850
<v 1>Yeah, exactly. Just the whole concept of Mario maker. Right?</v>

11
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.410
Like in Hollywood they were embracing like their fans creative side. Yeah.

12
00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:40.610
I love watching Mario making videos, so cool. But no, but,

13
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.930
but at the same time they like Mario party online. No, I never heard of that.

14
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.170
Oh, that's the biggest missed opportunity.

15
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.400
You just said three magical words that I didn't think I needed to hear.

16
00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:55.730
And then I was just like, why, why, why have I never thought of this before?

17
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.490
It's like that meme of like whisper the three sixties.

18
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.180
<v 0>I can't believe they released super Mario party on like two in 2000,</v>

19
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.133
like 18 months.

20
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.130
And it didn't have online play and had like full maps and they was. Sorry. I,

21
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.740
yeah, I was so disappointed because I love Mario Paul.

22
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.120
<v 1>It's still good land, but you know, online would be amazing.</v>

23
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.561
Okay.

24
00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:21.620
Do you feel that some part of the Mary potty experiences being next to each

25
00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:26.360
other and just, I get that like the option to do like online the streaming,

26
00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:29.990
right. If I need to, you know, it's the same thing with like smash, right?

27
00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:31.670
Like yeah. Yeah. Playing smash land,

28
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.120
like next to your friends and cheating on them. IRL is fun as. Yeah.

29
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.600
But we very quickly found out that online is also just as fun.

30
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.860
It's like a discord Cole like that fun as far.

31
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.500
<v 0>I mean, I, I feel like they just hate happiness sometimes.</v>

32
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.530
It's like I thought when,

33
00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:49.520
when super Meyer potty release has gotten way too much detail,

34
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.800
they had like full maps and they were all mid and I was like, okay,

35
00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:55.820
well they'll release new ones. Right. They'll update it. They'll love DLC.

36
00:01:55.821 --> 00:02:00.140
Right. A liar. So that never happened. So I guess, dude,

37
00:02:00.141 --> 00:02:03.350
I'm still sad about that, but then it could have been something good. Yeah.

38
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.070
<v 1>I'm always just hoping next Maria parties is the one that's going to be online.</v>

39
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.990
The problem with it is like,

40
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.050
everyone else is playing chess and they're just playing hungry hippos,

41
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.530
something like that. Sometimes, sometimes it's fun as.

42
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.820
But other times you're just like,

43
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.620
can you just go back to like a little bit of chess? You know? Like,

44
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:21.860
like play by the rules just a little bit. You know.

45
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.520
<v 0>I get it because you know, we live in Japan and they, they develop the games.</v>

46
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.640
I do not know of any Japanese people who go around to each other's houses.

47
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.290
<v 1>What do you mean? You never know.</v>

48
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.040
<v 0>Here are people, Japanese people meeting in that other people's houses.</v>

49
00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:38.600
It's always at an ease a or another place.

50
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.470
<v 1>Yeah. Maybe it's just because you don't have that many Japanese ones.</v>

51
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.160
I do have never do that. Oh, I do that with my Japanese friends. I mean,

52
00:02:46.161 --> 00:02:48.710
not obviously, not this year, not near as often.

53
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.660
<v 0>As like going out to like eat in these.</v>

54
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.340
<v 1>A car. Oh yeah, of course. But like,</v>

55
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.340
there's been a lot of cases where I would go out to eat and then we would go

56
00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:56.174
back to someone's place.

57
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.910
<v 0>It's like, I feel like in the West,</v>

58
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.660
we all like 90% of the time it's like meet up at each other's house,

59
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.830
get a few drinks.

60
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.600
<v 1>It's expensive to eat out. Whereas here it's like just like cheap.</v>

61
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.070
<v 0>Yeah. It's like the opposite where it's like,</v>

62
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.340
I feel like for a country that should value what seems to be like online,

63
00:03:11.341 --> 00:03:12.174
play more.

64
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.770
<v 1>For some reason they don't include it.</v>

65
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.280
Not because they don't need more like reasons to stay at home.

66
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.750
That's already a big enough problem.

67
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.620
[inaudible] was colluding with a gun to get all the Japanese people telling us,

68
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.320
like we're saving this generation from more Shiki. Komori.

69
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.890
<v 0>Ariel potty is Japanese. Uh Twista.</v>

70
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.480
<v 1>I felt like this is how we get them to invite them.</v>

71
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.880
Why mailings face like, look.

72
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.680
<v 0>Like I said something super racist.</v>

73
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.270
<v 1>Mario party and chill.</v>

74
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.740
[inaudible] rather crate,

75
00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:50.940
like the next Tron VR sex machine toy.

76
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.670
Then they would marry your party online. Let's be honest guys.

77
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.980
What was the thing we were talking about before we get, and it was the,

78
00:03:55.981 --> 00:04:00.900
it was the tango that operates with VR one. Yeah. Yeah.

79
00:04:00.901 --> 00:04:04.110
Have you seen that? It's like, so to explain,

80
00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:06.030
I can't believe I'm explaining tango Tenga.

81
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.470
So Tinga is just like an owner hall or like a Fleshlight Fleshlight. Basically.

82
00:04:10.471 --> 00:04:12.570
You stick your penis in it, but it's bliss branded.

83
00:04:12.571 --> 00:04:17.040
So it doesn't look like a Fleshlight. It's like really way too overly stylish.

84
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.020
It's a classic. It's a classic, a deodorant bottle. It's like a classy pocket.

85
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.160
That's what it is. But we got a colon first class pocket.

86
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.310
I hate that word pocket. I feel so wrong.

87
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.960
Just call it the tango.

88
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.930
But basically Tinga came out with this thing where it would it's machine

89
00:04:36.931 --> 00:04:39.300
operated with like AI in it.

90
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.380
And it works in tandem with VR porn.

91
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.760
So you'd be watching VR.

92
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.470
So you put this thing on your Willie and you don't have to touch it at all.

93
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.480
You start the VR porn and the thing will move in time with what you're seeing on

94
00:04:54.481 --> 00:04:55.314
the VR porn.

95
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.820
<v 0>I don't want, I don't want that. I don't want that go to a brothel, bro.</v>

96
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.940
<v 1>That's the first thing I think I'm like, just at that point,</v>

97
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.080
just go get laid by a real person please. That's that's like,

98
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.080
you're paying more for that tech. Then one session out of both.

99
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.370
<v 0>You know, going to the brothel is a bit different. I think you gotta, you gotta,</v>

100
00:05:14.371 --> 00:05:15.930
you know, you've gotta be the kind of person who's like, all right,

101
00:05:15.931 --> 00:05:17.790
I'm gonna go to a brothel. I get it. You know,

102
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.830
you'll probably if you want sex that badly,

103
00:05:19.831 --> 00:05:22.770
but you're too shameful to go to a brothel. I get it. You're going to pay light.

104
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.510
Walt. I don't know, 20 grand, then it's in your house. Right?

105
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.970
She never have visitors over.

106
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.530
<v 1>Exactly. Really? What does that, what is that like magical device in the corner.</v>

107
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.250
Oh, that's that's my second. I saw like a video of it. It's straight up.

108
00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:37.830
It looks like a torture device. If you don't know, if you don't know what it is.

109
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:39.840
<v 0>I saw that on the news,</v>

110
00:05:39.841 --> 00:05:42.270
they had a thing here where the government was commissioning,

111
00:05:42.271 --> 00:05:45.660
like AI companies to like match people together, which is the,

112
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.490
the birth rates declining so low.

113
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.820
<v 1>I also feel like that's going into like dystopian worlds.</v>

114
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.880
[inaudible].

115
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.100
<v 0>Well, that exists where we AI matching each other.</v>

116
00:05:56.101 --> 00:05:59.330
But then also having sex machines that cater for your every need. Yeah.

117
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.930
<v 1>Why would I, why would I sign up to the AI match?</v>

118
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.630
Like 50 shades of gray in like 2050 is just like,

119
00:06:04.631 --> 00:06:07.950
this guy just brings out his VR sex machine. Why, why,

120
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.760
why would I, why would I sign up for [inaudible]

121
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.760
? Would you like he's he's not romancing a real guy. He's romancing

122
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.593
 an anime girl. Why would I need to sign up for him?

123
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.270
<v 0>Making what I have to like come Tron 7,000 in my office? You know what I mean?</v>

124
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.320
Even with the AI determined, like how do you even determine that? I don't know.

125
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.350
You'll probably just see your star sign seems to be matched very well.

126
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.480
Capricorns at Sagittarius tend to very well knowing Japanese it'd probably be

127
00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:39.380
something like, Oh, it'll be,

128
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.570
it'll be blood type learning and male to female and it'll be right. That's good.

129
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.680
You're compatible with half the population. Fantastic. Nothing has changed.

130
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.410
I don't get Japan's obsession with blood types, man. That's weird.
