1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.421
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:00.421 --> 00:00:04.680
I guess that's the problem of when you're like serializing a Monga every week.

3
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:08.550
I wonder how much of it like is actually planned before and how much of it just

4
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:10.080
feels like it's falling apart.

5
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.710
<v 1>Which is why, like the more Mangar read,</v>

6
00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:14.660
the more I respect to something like one piece,

7
00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:18.690
which can keep coherency this long, you know what I mean? And,

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.180
and it just continually getting continually and just continually getting better

9
00:00:23.181 --> 00:00:24.860
and better. But I mean,

10
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.090
like that's also why I really value when a Monga just has a good ending,

11
00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:33.830
not even a mango, but just any meat, any media in anime, Mongo,

12
00:00:33.831 --> 00:00:37.580
light novels that just has an ending that people are satisfied with it.

13
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.790
I don't ask for much, but I do ask for a satisfactory ending.

14
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.250
<v 0>I I've, I've just the more I've been reading Monga.</v>

15
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.190
My pet peeve is like where it just starts to fall apart in the last 40 50

16
00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:48.380
chapters that's been really, that's been happening a lot.

17
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.671
<v 1>Ruins.</v>

18
00:00:49.671 --> 00:00:54.170
I feel like an experience of going through this entire long journey with these

19
00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:56.240
characters that you fall in love within this wall,

20
00:00:56.241 --> 00:00:59.540
but it is interesting for you to come to like a Olympic ending.

21
00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:02.690
You know what I mean? Like there are like, I, I swear to God,

22
00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:07.220
I can count the amount of like satisfying endings on like my hands in,

23
00:01:07.221 --> 00:01:11.990
in that I've read in Mongo because there is like most of the manga that I love

24
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.400
are still ongoing, like classics, like bezerk, vagabonds,

25
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.410
Vineland saga, for example.

26
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.090
And then there are other things like slam dunk where you just feel, you know,

27
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.540
it just kind of, kind of just ended, you know what I mean? It had its,

28
00:01:26.541 --> 00:01:27.730
you know what, come on you,

29
00:01:27.731 --> 00:01:31.580
you can't say that that final chapter of slam dunk don't spoil it for me.

30
00:01:31.581 --> 00:01:33.470
I want to read it. Okay. Well essentially,

31
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.200
like I'm not going to tell you how the story goes because it's a lot to unpack,

32
00:01:36.201 --> 00:01:38.240
but basically like slam dunk.

33
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.810
I really liked the final chapter of slam dunk because it was kind of like

34
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.040
experimental almost because almost another dimension,

35
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.300
the basketball slam dunk, you know, because what,

36
00:01:49.301 --> 00:01:53.180
what really made that like final chapter famous was the fact that almost the

37
00:01:53.181 --> 00:01:56.480
entirety of the final chapter has no dialogue. Oh, that's cool.

38
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.990
And it's just like it, like basically he was just like,

39
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.600
let me just show you the story rather than telling you the story. I,

40
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:07.010
I don't have the problem with the final chapter. I just felt like,

41
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.640
like the wrap-up or I felt like they,

42
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.750
they could have gone further with the entire story and I feel like he just kind

43
00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:18.380
of ran out of ideas and just kind of just ended it. You know what I mean?

44
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.880
But it's not that it wasn't a great final chapter. It was just that I,

45
00:02:21.881 --> 00:02:23.930
I wanted to spend more time with these characters now.

46
00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:27.470
I feel like that could have been room to spend more time and I'll go,

47
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.290
Oh, if we're talking about, if we're talking about absolute cuckold endings,

48
00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:38.000
like [inaudible] go is a show. No, no, no,

49
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:40.290
not a go Mongo. It's it's.

50
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.050
<v 0>Yeah. This one by the, well, in the ghost.</v>

51
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.910
<v 1>Yeah. The one where that goes, teachers doesn't end. Well, it just ends</v>

52
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.390
in like a really controversial way where people were kind of just like,

53
00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.500
wow,

54
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.490
there must've been some like strings behind the scenes that will kind of just

55
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:03.220
like, you're going to end it this way, whether you like it or not,

56
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.390
because it's very, very on satisfactory. Yeah. Nobody.

57
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:10.840
Was there any good endings that you can think of off the top of your heads,

58
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.580
aside from where you asked me to put into it?

59
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.270
I know you were about to mention her. You asked me,

60
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.850
I think of the most like genius ending. It's all to be put in place.

61
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.300
<v 0>Yeah. I haven't read light many moderate compared to Jerry, but I don't know.</v>

62
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.230
I'm happy enough if it just doesn't completely itself near the end. I honestly,

63
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.850
is that how it is that how it is to be man?

64
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.320
<v 1>As long as it doesn't completely everything up. Yeah. I'll be okay.</v>

65
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.140
Like average. I'm still satisfied with it. Yeah, exactly.

66
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.840
I just recently finished watching reading B stars.

67
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.450
Just the last volume came out like a week ago. Yeah.

68
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.520
Not the strongest ending in my opinion,

69
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.030
but it wasn't a complete show of an ending. So I was like, you know what?

70
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.150
I'm satisfied. Like, okay, could have been better,

71
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.100
but it could have been a lot worse as well. So.

72
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.330
<v 0>Is the ending of a Mongo that important QV salsa music?</v>

73
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.250
<v 1>I feel like if an ending of a Monga or even an anime is good,</v>

74
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.260
that can bring it up from like a,

75
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.150
from like a decent show to like a master. Yeah.

76
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.000
I mean, I mean the biggest example I can think of is the cluster.

77
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.570
That was code yellow season two. Yeah.

78
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.740
And yet somehow the like I will never forget it because of how great the

79
00:04:22.741 --> 00:04:26.610
ending was. Same with something like cowboy bebop, for example, as well.

80
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.470
<v 0>The ending matters more anatomy than it doesn't bond, I think is the difference.</v>

81
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.040
I don't know. I think the way you linked lengthened,

82
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.010
the way that you experienced it,

83
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.900
I remember vastly the best bits for Monga more than I do.

84
00:04:39.901 --> 00:04:42.990
Like I said, I, when I look back on Monga,

85
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.560
I remember it it's like an amalgamation of like the whole experience together as

86
00:04:46.561 --> 00:04:51.030
opposed to episodes and like scenes and also, um,

87
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.210
yeah, so I just find that when I finish them. Yeah.

88
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.010
I'd rarely ever think about the ending of any of them.

89
00:04:56.011 --> 00:04:57.600
I just think about my favorite moments really.

90
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.770
<v 1>Um, I'm the complete opposite, I think with manga,</v>

91
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.800
I think more about like certain scenes, whereas with anime,

92
00:05:04.801 --> 00:05:07.260
I think about it kind of as a whole. Yeah. Yeah.

93
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.590
And I think maybe it's because I binge anime,

94
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.910
so I kind of experienced the animate all at once. Whereas with manga,

95
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.640
a lot of it, because it's rather long, like for me,

96
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.610
a couple of episodes I've binged both.

97
00:05:20.611 --> 00:05:23.070
So I guess ending's always important to me,

98
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.180
especially if I've felt like I've spent like a lot of time with these

99
00:05:27.181 --> 00:05:29.430
characters, like, like it doesn't have to be a,

100
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:30.990
it doesn't have to be like an amazing ending,

101
00:05:30.991 --> 00:05:32.790
but what I want is a satisfying ending,

102
00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:37.230
but if there's an ending that is actually amazing and sticks with me,

103
00:05:37.231 --> 00:05:39.570
then I'll always remember that Mongo. It's true.

104
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.690
<v 0>Because I read all of Finland saga, which is amazing. Yeah.</v>

105
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.200
Up to the point where it was out like a few months ago. Yeah. And if I,

106
00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:47.280
if I never read it again,

107
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.190
I probably be happy knowing that I had a good story up to where it,

108
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.900
or up to where I got to, which sounds weird.

109
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.540
Cause it like literally was in the middle of like a fight. I was like,

110
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.530
you know what? I've.

111
00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.670
<v 1>Read a lot. I've read, I've read so much of this.</v>

112
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.470
<v 0>That I'm actually satisfied if I just stop reading this Mongo, I'll be okay.</v>

113
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:04.543
Yeah, I'm fine.

114
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.280
<v 1>But I guess that's where the double-edged sword is. Right.</v>

115
00:06:06.281 --> 00:06:10.090
Is that the longer the mung it goes for the more greater of an ending you expect

116
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.610
almost, I guess sometimes, or sometimes you just, cause sometimes you are,

117
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.970
you've read a market for so long that you kind of just want it to end.

118
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.750
You can get hugged. You kind of just, cause that was me with narrow tone,

119
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.450
tells me with bleach, you know what I mean? Where they,

120
00:06:28.451 --> 00:06:30.490
they got to a point when I was just like,

121
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.840
I am reading this purely because I've invested so much time and it it's,

122
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.510
it's it's, it's the league problem. Right. You're just like,

123
00:06:37.511 --> 00:06:40.990
I've invested so much time in this that I just need to,

124
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.040
I just need to play it out. What would you say is the cap then you just know.

125
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.350
<v 0>It's like a feeling, right? Like when I was reading ice shield,</v>

126
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.990
I like when it goes to like chapter, like 250, I'm like, all right,

127
00:06:49.991 --> 00:06:53.500
let's wrap it up. But it had like another a hundred left. I was like, all right.

128
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.840
I like, this felt like it went on long enough.

129
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.910
Like it felt like they were adding too many things.

130
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.010
Like a lot of mangrove had that wet.

131
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.220
Like what was once a gigantic threat earlier on?

132
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.730
They haven't changed much in power will suddenly be like, they dispatch it.

133
00:07:06.731 --> 00:07:10.090
And like once one hit. Right. There's so many stuff like that where it's like,

134
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.700
so this really cool enemy you introduced,

135
00:07:12.701 --> 00:07:14.350
you stopped just one shotting later on. Yeah.

136
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:15.670
<v 1>It's like, what's the point of this?</v>

137
00:07:15.671 --> 00:07:19.030
Like you're just completely ruining all the steaks over and over again.

138
00:07:19.031 --> 00:07:19.360
I hate it.
