1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.440
<v 0>But in general, uh, I, I do find taxis a little awkward.</v>

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.410
I dunno as somebody again, who thinks about things a lot socially,

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.860
I like to think of like the perfect social situations. What's the.

4
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.070
<v 1>What's good about them? Well, I don't understand. Okay.</v>

5
00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:16.100
Well actually talk so highly of taxis in Japan. It's good.

6
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:17.630
<v 0>Because I know they'll,</v>

7
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.790
they'll actually know some of them do actually try and talk to me.

8
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.100
None of them ever talk to me, but some of them, some of them will. Yeah.

9
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.750
<v 1>I, I feel some of the older ones, they bust out a conversation. Someone who'd.</v>

10
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.000
<v 0>Also maybe learned English in college.</v>

11
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.050
<v 1>Or something. I've noticed taxi drivers in the countryside to me. Oh yeah.</v>

12
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.220
They love talking. Yeah. In the city. It's just like, all right. It's, you're,

13
00:00:37.221 --> 00:00:40.490
you're a customer. I am a taxi driver. I will not communicate in any way,

14
00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:41.324
shape or form.

15
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.610
<v 0>It's charming. Um, and in Japan,</v>

16
00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:46.550
I think one of the taxi drivers time talk to you because especially in English,

17
00:00:46.551 --> 00:00:48.260
when they try and talk to you, it's like, Oh, you were,

18
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.630
you were putting in the work. So please focus on driving. But you know,

19
00:00:50.631 --> 00:00:51.464
go ahead and.

20
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.940
<v 1>Taxi driver I ever had was in, um, it was in Okinawa and, uh,</v>

21
00:00:55.941 --> 00:00:58.700
we were going from what constitutes a good taxi driver. Yeah.

22
00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:02.210
That's a good question. I guess it was a good taxi driver drivers talk to you.

23
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.610
Sometimes I got to be in the right mood. Yeah, same here.

24
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.140
Like sometimes I'm just so, like, you know, 3:00 AM. Right.

25
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.650
And I'm like either drunk or just title both. And I'm stepping in,

26
00:01:12.651 --> 00:01:16.400
I don't want to have a conversation with the text. Yeah, yeah. Some sometimes,

27
00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:18.800
sometimes you get in a taxi driver and they ask how your day's going.

28
00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:21.920
And I'm just like, [inaudible], by the way I live, here we go. Here we go.

29
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.930
<v 0>I mean, it depends if I'm alone or with friends, I mean,</v>

30
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.560
have you ever had a taxi driver who bought into a conversation between you and

31
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:31.394
friends?

32
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.400
<v 1>Yeah. I hate that. I'm like, Whoa,</v>

33
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.980
hold up in the social invitations.

34
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.360
None of the best right ahead. Wasn't Okinawa, because we were,

35
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.990
we were going to go if we were going from our hotel to this, like one, uh,

36
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.150
causal in Naha and it was like a 30 minute taxi ride. Um,

37
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.300
and the dude was like, you know, obviously an older gentleman,

38
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.160
but he clearly had been there his entire life. So, and he knew immediately,

39
00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.260
he was like, Oh, foreign is you clearly,

40
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.000
I don't know a whole lot about this place. Huh.

41
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.200
And he started talking and he took us on this really scenic route.

42
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.620
Like all these like places, but she said, he's like,

43
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.040
I took you on the Sini crude, but I'll charge you for the regular. Oh,

44
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.510
so he was nice enough. So he was like,

45
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.600
actually like kind of stop the car and kind of be like, this is this. And

46
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.290
[inaudible] I actually had something very similar happened to me when I went to

47
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.690
Koshi Valley because we want it to go to the taxi drivers.

48
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.400
<v 0>Just part-time like tourists.</v>

49
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.580
<v 1>I think they're just happy because they just have one,</v>

50
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.940
they're happy to have tourists there because I'm pretty sure business has not

51
00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:39.290
been banging this year. Um, so yeah, we, me and Sydney was on his taxi drive,

52
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.870
uh, on his taxi ride to get to this winery. And he's like,

53
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.330
let me give you a tour of the other wineries in the area as well.

54
00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:47.000
Just in case you want to go. Yeah. Yeah. You want to go to it? And he, yeah.

55
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:51.830
He only charged us for the taxi rides to the one winery. But yeah,

56
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.460
we got a tour of like one rebounded, show me these taxi drivers. I'll never,

57
00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.010
again, like I feel taxi drivers like that. That really only in the countryside.

58
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.710
Yeah. You don't really.

59
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.440
<v 0>Get that dude in Tokyo. That miserable. Yeah. I would be to be honest, I also,</v>

60
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.570
this, uh, what's the, Oh, it's in Roppongi. There's a big cemetery. Um,

61
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.433
I'll find it.

62
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.450
<v 1>I'll.</v>

63
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.610
<v 0>Send you a picture of me down, but um,</v>

64
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.150
there's this whole area right next to this giant cemetery ripe.

65
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.180
There's a big stretch of road. Taxi drivers, just sleep.

66
00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:26.230
There are really hundreds of taxis parked. Right.

67
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.250
And they all park and they all just sleep and like change clothes in this area.

68
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.240
It's on a busy road in a really busy area, which they all just sleep there. Wow.

69
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.140
So bizarre. Yeah. You can do that here. You can just park your car on the,

70
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:42.310
on a busy road and just sleep like people do that. It's so weird.

71
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.300
You can't do that in the UK. No, I feel most countries you can't do that.

72
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.980
Even in the countryside. That'd be weird.

73
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:50.440
Someone would come and stop you and be like, yo, are you okay? What's up?

74
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.900
<v 1>Have you, by the way seen, I couldn't believe this, but have you seen, uh,</v>

75
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.340
those like rare taxis that you can get in Tokyo brand taxes?

76
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.890
I can't believe Japan has actually done this,

77
00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:05.790
but they've literally turned taxis into. Gotcha. No more.

78
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.400
They have wait, I forgot the exact name of it,

79
00:04:11.401 --> 00:04:13.560
but I think it's called like SOCRA taxis.

80
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.130
So you know how like in most taxis until, and this is only a Tokyo thing, uh,

81
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.330
but like, you know, how on taxis,

82
00:04:18.331 --> 00:04:22.200
like they usually have like the signs on top of the car, like show, you know,

83
00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:25.470
whether the taxi's open or whatnot. Yeah. Apparently out of,

84
00:04:25.471 --> 00:04:30.180
I think like the 7,400 taxi cars in the greater Tokyo area,

85
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.040
there are five taxis that have like a soccer thing on top of it.

86
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.630
And supposedly that's like the SSR or taxis. And it's like,

87
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.760
what am I? Cause one of my friends, I actually got it the other day. Um,

88
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.330
and when you enter into the taxi, it's lot, lot nicer.

89
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.450
And like actually like first class of taxis and inside,

90
00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:54.420
there's like a little sheet of paper that says, congratulations,

91
00:04:54.421 --> 00:04:58.560
you found one of five cultural red taxis. I hate that.

92
00:04:58.561 --> 00:05:02.400
I think that's so cool. Yeah. I think that's so cool. And I'm just like,

93
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.510
I really want to kind of go around now trying to find this mythical taxi.

94
00:05:06.511 --> 00:05:10.050
This SSR maxi dude, my, my, my Gachet pool.

95
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.790
It's the Gacha pool of taxis now already. He's like,

96
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.390
Oh my every time you use like Tokyo taxi, it's just like, come on,

97
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.110
give me the SSR. Give me the, what is this?

98
00:05:22.111 --> 00:05:26.790
Like a North point naught one or something like that. it. I'll give it a go.

99
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.250
Why not? Let's let's get more taxi.

100
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.100
Just calling a taxi after taxi his house.

101
00:05:32.101 --> 00:05:35.940
And they're all just parked up either way as I see it now don't worry.

102
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.420
I don't need a taxi. Let me it's like, Oh. It's blue bag blue bag. Just like,

103
00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:43.350
come on, give me the gold bag back. Well, I just think that's so fun.

104
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.510
We can call that. Like, that's just like one extra,

105
00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:47.880
I guess like piece of enjoyment you can have as a tourist. Right?

106
00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:52.140
Like knowing that now when you come to Japan and you go on a taxi, like you can,

107
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.010
you can look forward to that being like finna pull the SSR, some taxis.

108
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.500
It's the one reason a tourist.

109
00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.490
You should use a taxi because God they're expensive in Japan or in Tokyo.

110
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.990
<v 0>They get off. If you take a short journey as well,</v>

111
00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.320
but I've taken sometimes I've had like too much to carry.

112
00:06:08.321 --> 00:06:10.690
So I've had to get like, it's like a short walk from the station to my house.

113
00:06:10.691 --> 00:06:13.900
But I remember like a few times I've gotten the taxi because I had like too much

114
00:06:13.901 --> 00:06:16.120
stuff to carry. They were like, Oh duh.

115
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.820
<v 1>Okay. Oh, here. And then I said.</v>

116
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.850
<v 0>Yeah. And then I said like, thank you when I leave and they don't say it back.</v>

117
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.960
And I'm like, wow. Okay. In Japan, that's like the biggest, you. Yeah.

118
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.620
Thank you. Back the audacity. That's like the equivalent of flipping the book.

119
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.933
Yeah.

120
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:33.250
<v 1>I can realize that until.</v>

121
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.560
<v 0>Someone pointed out that it happened another time as well. They're like, wow.</v>

122
00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:36.850
That was really rude. I'm like, well, is he? Yeah.

123
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.870
<v 1>He didn't say thank you back. Whatever. What? what a.</v>

124
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.380
<v 0>What happened was a similar situation where it's like a very short journey.</v>

125
00:06:44.381 --> 00:06:46.000
It was like an $8 journey.

126
00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.210
And then I got out and the other person where he was like, wow,

127
00:06:49.211 --> 00:06:51.970
that was so rude. I'm like, what was rude? He just drove us.

128
00:06:51.971 --> 00:06:53.650
He didn't say anything. He's like, yeah. I said, thank you.

129
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.960
He didn't say it back. I'm like, Oh, okay. All right. Here's the.

130
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.750
<v 1>Udacity of this piece. I'm a fit.</v>

131
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:01.540
<v 0>To get back in that car and give him a slap, you know like.</v>

132
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.490
<v 1>Well, like that's the thing. It's like,</v>

133
00:07:03.491 --> 00:07:07.090
it's just Tokyo taxis that are just so expensive. Because like,

134
00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.410
if you think about it,

135
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.850
catching a taxi in Tokyo is a luxury because trains are just so

136
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.030
convenient Tokyo. Whereas the moment you're out of the greater Tokyo area,

137
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.130
a lot of places without a taxi you'll feel.

138
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.980
<v 0>Yeah. It depends. I think it depends where you're going, because there's some,</v>

139
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.500
if you're on the outskirts of Tokyo sometimes going,

140
00:07:23.501 --> 00:07:26.920
if you're going in like an art, like a spotlight light, not quarter circle,

141
00:07:26.921 --> 00:07:30.010
let's say that they don't really have trains that go like London. Right.

142
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.060
It's the exact same what trains go in and out and they don't go round normal.

143
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:38.560
Right. So if you want to go to the outskirts, most of the time to get like just,

144
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.900
you know, a 15 minute taxi drive away,

145
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.080
it might require you to go in all the way to central and then go out.

146
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.420
It's like 50 minutes. And it's like, well,

147
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.570
you know how much is 45 minutes of my time worth or 30 minutes.

148
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:51.760
<v 1>But I think like the majority of people.</v>

149
00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.410
<v 0>Just don't care about that. Right? Yeah. If you're like, you know, go into,</v>

150
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.670
whereas in Okinawa, there's literally.

151
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:02.110
<v 1>One tram line that goes for five stops and that's the only train line that they</v>

152
00:08:02.111 --> 00:08:03.460
have on the entire Island.

153
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.700
So that's why the taxis are like half the price that you get in Tokyo.

154
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.850
<v 0>Yeah. If the, if the people rely on it, the local government will.</v>

155
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:10.893
<v 1>Yeah. Like a 30,</v>

156
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.040
30 minute taxi ride in Oakland I was talking about was like 2000 yen. Oh.

157
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.870
Seriously. It's really, really Tokyo. That would be about like 60,

158
00:08:19.871 --> 00:08:20.920
70 bucks.

159
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.700
<v 0>Right? The in Tokyo, they don't, they don't make people retire.</v>

160
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.600
They make them become tasks.

161
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.880
<v 1>That's funny. Most times driver, when I see a young taxi driver, I'm like, wow,</v>

162
00:08:30.881 --> 00:08:35.110
you've made a career choice, career choice here. What's going on?

163
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.680
<v 0>I speak to people. And they, like, I swear to God, they look,</v>

164
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.860
they look at taxi drivers, like McDonald's walk is here. Like it's like,

165
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.290
it's it's uh, because yeah, because it's like,

166
00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:46.900
you don't need any qualifications except drive, which, you know,

167
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:47.823
they expect you to do.

168
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.650
It's just like a throwaway job they make [inaudible]. Yeah.

169
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.060
<v 1>Yeah, yeah. Basically. It's like,</v>

170
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.210
I've I think the average age of a taxi driver here is like 70.

171
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.070
Like you're gonna retire.

172
00:08:56.070 --> 00:09:00.720
<v 0>Or will you retire or become a taxi driver?</v>

173
00:09:00.721 --> 00:09:01.554
It's like.

174
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.900
<v 1>Taxi driver or like a construction worker, but not actually construction.</v>

175
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.900
Just like holding the signs and paint like this way, please.

176
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.230
<v 0>It's nuts. How fast they build houses here. It's like crazy.</v>

177
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.670
We had like a whole school be built right next to the apartment I'm living in,

178
00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:21.440
in the span of the year I was living here, which is insane. They built a full,

179
00:09:21.441 --> 00:09:24.080
like three story house next to me. And like two months.

180
00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:29.510
<v 1>I was like, what the? What the? This is crazy. Like,</v>

181
00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.690
especially like say when you go into like the city or whatever,

182
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.640
and you haven't been for maybe like a couple of months,

183
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.270
it's surprising the amount of things that have changed being like, Oh,

184
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.820
this building was completely different two months ago.

185
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.560
And now this is magically here.
