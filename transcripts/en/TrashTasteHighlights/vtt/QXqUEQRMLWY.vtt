00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.110
<v 0>Speaking of Virginia, you,</v>

2
00:00:01.111 --> 00:00:05.820
you gave Dragonball and Dragonball Z both a nine out of 10. I thought dragon.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.170
<v 1>No, that's good. Are you going.</v>

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.520
<v 0>To look me in the eye and say it's an original dragon ball is a nine? No.</v>

5
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.980
<v 2>Okay. Just puts into perspective how long ago, but I probably put that in, like.</v>

6
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.910
<v 0>How many derive on movies? You can't it up. Ryan, one movie, a masterpiece.</v>

7
00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:27.290
You gave that a 10 and you're going to give.

8
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.040
<v 3>Like, which one? Which story? I want a movie. It's so good. There are many.</v>

9
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.860
<v 0>16. You gave a 10. What is special? About 16. Okay.</v>

10
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.600
That wasn't my Schindler's list.

11
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.240
<v 3>Okay. That was the third door. I'm on movie. I think it's 16. No,</v>

12
00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:46.100
that the remake is 16. Yeah. The original is the third one, which I like,

13
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.140
which doesn't exist on my enemy list for summer.

14
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.460
But I gave that a 10 purely because I watched that movie.

15
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.670
That was one of the first I'm on movies I ever watched. And I mean, if you guys.

16
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.100
<v 2>Don't have a bad guy now.</v>

17
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.370
<v 3>It's good. Like honestly, like sweat,</v>

18
00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:05.380
like even now I could probably re watch that movie and still find it, enjoy it.

19
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.810
Um, yeah. I dunno. Dharma Dharma holds a special place in my heart.

20
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.670
As you can tell from the amount of derive on.

21
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.010
<v 2>Me. So I'm just like, I didn't even know.</v>

22
00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:15.380
There were this many dark island do still making door.

23
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.920
I'm I'm I'm surprised someone else has been watching Dora Mon like further,

24
00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:21.140
along than when they were a kid watching on TV.

25
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.220
Cause that's the only exposure I've ever had to dry. Yeah.

26
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.810
It probably would never go out my way. Yeah. I.

27
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.400
<v 3>Completely understand if you did not grow up with Doraemon,</v>

28
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.090
I do not blame you for not watching a single derive or movie or episode,

29
00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:39.110
because that hard to get into as an adult. But if you grew up with it,

30
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:40.700
like I did, then you can easily go.

31
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.050
<v 2>Back to me. It's kind of like, yeah. As a grown up grown adult, I'll just like,</v>

32
00:01:45.051 --> 00:01:48.860
watch the Teletubbies movies where it's like,

33
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.560
[inaudible].

34
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.930
<v 0>Have to like talk to like a niece or something. And then you're like, oh,</v>

35
00:01:53.931 --> 00:01:56.510
show me what you watch and you watch it. You're like, what the is happening?

36
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.390
<v 1>That's just. It's just wild. What is this?</v>

37
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.150
<v 2>That's pulling all my parents thought when I was watching,</v>

38
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.160
what the is this blue thing.

39
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.670
<v 0>I noticed you gave full metal Alchemist and full metal Alchemist. Brotherhood.</v>

40
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.690
Both a seven.

41
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.100
<v 3>Yeah, because it's like my hero. It was, it was good.</v>

42
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.790
<v 0>The hood is not it's like at least an eight or a nine.</v>

43
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.800
<v 2>Yeah, it was except hold on. Hold on. Let me, let, let, let me, let me, uh, let,</v>

44
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.860
let, let me ask. Okay. Wait, you gave full metal Alchemist a seven.

45
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.990
How dare you Joey. All day. I am so offended right now.

46
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.800
The old data to your pitch, the audacity.

47
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.140
<v 0>To the new view has gone, has never worn that.</v>

48
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.710
<v 2>Scene with Nina and the dog. Mike did,</v>

49
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.630
did you notice the feels from

50
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:48.140
[inaudible]? I'm.

51
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.900
<v 0>Not trying to say like, you need to give it like a 10. I'm just saying,</v>

52
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.040
I think it's okay.

53
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.040
<v 3>Here's the thing with that one.</v>

54
00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:58.790
I still stand by that to this day because like a lot of people,

55
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.220
it not the first anime I watched, I watched that way after a kid made me too.

56
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.910
Right. It was probably one of the first ones you watched, right?

57
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.880
For that first 20. Yeah, exactly counts.

58
00:03:08.881 --> 00:03:10.620
Might've been in like the first 200 for.

59
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.870
<v 2>Me. I don't know. I feel like out of all the anime I've watched definitely.</v>

60
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.690
<v 3>My, my experience with full metal Alchemist is basically gone. So next step,</v>

61
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.740
which is because.

62
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.590
<v 2>I hear about it so much. I watched it out of obligation.</v>

63
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.360
God, hasn't got to the stage. I haven't got to that stage.

64
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.410
Every time someone asks me a day gets added on. I'm pretty sure I like,

65
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.360
and I was like, that was like that.

66
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.820
<v 3>As well. And I'm just like, you know what? I got time.</v>

67
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.890
<v 2>I'll watch it. Just because I hear about.</v>

68
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.120
<v 0>It from like sitting, like.</v>

69
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.110
<v 3>How did you, my watch? So I watched so, okay.</v>

70
00:03:43.111 --> 00:03:45.480
You don't have to watch the first full minute. It's just watch brotherhood.

71
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.280
Right? You hear that all the time, but I'm like, no, no.

72
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.830
I want to see why people are saying that. Right.

73
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.550
So I watched the original and I was like, okay, this was adequate.

74
00:03:53.551 --> 00:03:57.480
So brotherhood must be a lot better, like a lot, lot, lot better. When I heard.

75
00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.640
<v 2>It, I was like, yeah, it's better.</v>

76
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.450
<v 3>But like essentially the same thing. Point higher, better. It's essentially the,</v>

77
00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:06.960
no, it's not the first full metal Alchemist is like a low seven.

78
00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.620
And brotherhood is like a high seven call. It is, that's all it is.
