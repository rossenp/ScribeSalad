WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.050
<v 0>And are they constantly looking for new animators? Always. Always, right. Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.310
<v 1>Yeah. I, I guess it's cause if you're not getting paid like a lot,</v>

3
00:00:07.311 --> 00:00:08.180
it's hard to find.

4
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.650
<v 0>So yeah. Uh, actually if you too expensive,</v>

5
00:00:12.651 --> 00:00:17.600
so all day we don't have to Birgit stories over some one else. Right?

6
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.260
<v 1>You mentioned Twitter as well as I hardly find a lot of the newer talent.</v>

7
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.150
<v 0>Future also, because now we're on Twitter. I think, you know, the generation,</v>

8
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.800
some quite a friend, an amazing animators who, yeah,

9
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.790
welcome pretty much, pretty much. I'm just wondering. So.

10
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.050
<v 1>Is there this much of a shortage of animators in Japan that they have to look</v>

11
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.280
literally on Twitter,

12
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.490
they're doing what we do and just browsing Twitter and being like you, you,

13
00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:44.600
you seem to have a good time.

14
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.780
<v 0>All by your recommendation by, uh, by your, as a senpai. Oh,</v>

15
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.050
I had walk with this young guy he's pretty skilled for, or,

16
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.100
um, I will have walked with this. We had some program,

17
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.930
but you can manage to walk on it. Uh, so you have, uh, depends.

18
00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:05.830
I see if you walk with a friend, people, you,

19
00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:10.250
you know that they are learning by themselves by themselves and they're doing

20
00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:15.050
all the best as they want and they accepted the amount of money. And so,

21
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.950
uh, they, they actually accident.

22
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.340
It's no more because they are learning by yourself and yeah.

23
00:01:22.341 --> 00:01:24.950
You have to teach them how to get better.

24
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.030
<v 1>Yeah, yeah. Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.360
Because I actually have like an artist friend who used to like draw stuff for me

26
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.260
years ago, he ended up being an animator for a black Clover. Yeah. Same here.

27
00:01:33.261 --> 00:01:35.390
Like I had a, like a,

28
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.110
an artist who I was following in an animator and then they just showed up,

29
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:42.320
working on solo art online. Yeah. Shout out to Kate,

30
00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:44.660
shout out to Kay animations. It's just weird. How that, like,

31
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.780
I didn't think like, I'd always heard of like the web gen animators,

32
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.140
we call them, but like, I've never actually like seen it happen.

33
00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:53.180
So when I saw it happen, I was like, Oh wow.

34
00:01:53.181 --> 00:01:57.350
They actually use Twitter as like a formal thing. Like yeah, exactly.

35
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.480
<v 0>Sings. Uh, the flashpoint we can take, like was maybe at</v>

36
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.810
the border too. It is at the 65 or you have a, Oh,

37
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:09.644
that fight.

38
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.140
<v 1>That's the moment she Saskia versus Saskia narrative versus MoMA. Shiki guides.</v>

39
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.440
Yeah.

40
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.300
<v 0>And in fact, a is the director was, uh, uh, cyclical son. And, uh,</v>

41
00:02:20.301 --> 00:02:24.830
he he's a Chinese guy who success to, um,

42
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.100
Oh, call a lot of foreign animators.

43
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.020
And he was by himself for doing the assistant projects in, by himself, uh,

44
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.720
trying to contact a lot of animators,

45
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.750
check her darker to put some correction.

46
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.910
And I think he had spent, uh, two months study,

47
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.060
but because of him, he could manage a lot of animators to walk on disappeared.

48
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.850
And the piece of 65 of Bartow was a masterclass.

49
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.750
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, that was my favorite flights. I've seen the fight.</v>

50
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.650
I don't know anything, but I know I haven't seen, I haven't seen burrito.

51
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.010
I've just seen that fight. And that was my fault,

52
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.930
like the best flights of the year.

53
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.330
<v 0>Right. And with these explicit is proof. Okay.</v>

54
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.450
For an animators can also walk Japanese animation,

55
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.630
but you have problems about communication.

56
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.550
You have some staff who have to speak

57
00:03:20.551 --> 00:03:23.460
English or if they can speak Japanese it's okay.

58
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.840
Or sometimes you have some mistakes by them, but yes, it's a,

59
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.400
if you work with foreign, some it's happened better. Uh,

60
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.810
if you correct them and we do the best to.

61
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.090
<v 1>What would you say is the best way for,</v>

62
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.570
let's say a young animator to get involved in the anime industry now?

63
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.630
<v 0>Well, no, like I said, it depends the experience you want. If you want,</v>

64
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.050
just walk out, just want to walk on one piece. We would just want, okay.

65
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.740
So Twitter will be okay. I think, uh,

66
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.950
or I won't just a one year experience. Uh, I, so I, okay. Let's see.

67
00:03:56.951 --> 00:03:58.560
If you want to come to Japan,

68
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.470
you have to find us to Duke could prove you a visa.

69
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.450
Couldn't be a lot of hoops to jump. And if you want a carrier,

70
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.000
I want to work in Japan. I want to live in Japan.

71
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:10.680
I want to marry the Japanese girl.

72
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.570
<v 2>I want that ideal Wiebe lives. So.</v>

73
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.680
<v 1>For you to assume,</v>

74
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.410
we're going to have enough time and money to marry a Japanese girls and

75
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.860
animator. I was thinking of asking, but I don't know how postal is.

76
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.820
Cause you mentioned that like obviously the San pies,

77
00:04:23.821 --> 00:04:26.400
they have a family and whatnot. How the does anyone date?

78
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.590
<v 2>Because it sounds like you guys never leave the office. How do you,</v>

79
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.940
do you bring them to the office? You're like, hold on. I'm gonna do a key frame.

80
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.863
I'll answer the question.

81
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.430
Have you ever brought a date to the office.

82
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.490
<v 0>That, um, actually, yes. So, uh, I'm working at this to do and, and also, um,</v>

83
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.220
so sometime I'm working on two shows at the same time.

84
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.650
So I'm working on the movie and sometimes.

85
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.960
<v 2>Again, how did you find the time</v>

86
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.170
unless you're dating another key animator, she's two lock style

87
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.983
tables away.

88
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.960
<v 0>I prefer not data to,</v>

89
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.970
[inaudible] speaking a bit about animations for going to a bit cure my passion.

90
00:05:11.971 --> 00:05:15.510
I will say I prefer to talk as a scenes. Uh.

91
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.070
<v 1>Oh yeah, of course. I mean,</v>

92
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.520
you have the love of your life revolving around making a show where you want to

93
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.300
break.

94
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.960
<v 0>I'm thinking any mission. I, I walk on emission I and emissions.</v>
