1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.390
<v 0>During back to the debate about, am I a real anime factor? But like,</v>

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.050
cause you mentioned something, you said like, uh, V tuba is whatever anime,

3
00:00:07.051 --> 00:00:08.430
manga Gacha games.

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.480
Why do you feel like Gacha games is like a big part of being an animate fan.

5
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.580
<v 1>Gotcha. Gotcha. Is originally from Japan. From anime? Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.640
It's Japanese kind of invented it.

7
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.330
<v 0>Yeah, but it doesn't mean it's it's not that deep in anime culture. Right?</v>

8
00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:24.230
It's like, no, it kind of,

9
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.960
I couldn't be an anime fan without ever playing a Gachet game.

10
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.590
<v 1>Yeah, of course you can't play, but it very rarely play gotcha.</v>

11
00:00:30.591 --> 00:00:31.850
Game without being an animate fan. Yeah.

12
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.750
<v 0>Exactly. I mean,</v>

13
00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:36.770
there's plenty of original light Gacha games out there that aren't anime based

14
00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:37.340
at all.

15
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.590
<v 1>But how many people play those compared to the enemy base scout your games?</v>

16
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.840
<v 0>Well, I mean, well again, impact anatomy game. How has, how has ginching.</v>

17
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.880
<v 1>Impact no anatomy? Yeah. Well, I would consider.</v>

18
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.940
<v 0>Animate being like the actual, like Monga.</v>

19
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.340
<v 1>No, like I'm more talking about like the anime</v>

20
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.490
[inaudible] lanes, the arc nights,

21
00:00:55.491 --> 00:00:59.030
like they want based off anything and then same with Vichi was right.

22
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.470
Like I would say who's watching V tubers. Who's never watched anime before.

23
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.030
You know what I mean? That's, that's a confused dad watching.

24
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.680
<v 0>I liked, I liked the gotcha games. I mean,</v>

25
00:01:09.681 --> 00:01:12.350
I've really enjoyed doc nights when I was playing that I don't really play it

26
00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:15.170
anymore. Um, but like again, she was fine.

27
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.470
I didn't like I couldn't skip any of the dialogue. I think they added.

28
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.630
<v 1>That. Now they've added that literally rage quit.</v>

29
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.990
<v 0>One of my streams because there was so much dialogue and it wouldn't have stop</v>

30
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.890
and you would walk 10 seconds to get another dialogue for two minutes.

31
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.850
This is taking the. It's just ridiculous. No one can enjoy it.

32
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.100
<v 1>Yeah. I want to say, I want to see you play y'all cause a game.</v>

33
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.600
You probably lose your mind.

34
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.650
<v 0>I'd be like, what is happening? What is going on? And like,</v>

35
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.700
I don't get it. How people can get excited for every new gotcha game.

36
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.270
That's a question you have to ask.

37
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.300
You've been brainwashed into being excited for rates that are higher than

38
00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:53.960
2%. We're like boys, boys, it's practically 50 50,

39
00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.540
but it's practically 1%.

40
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.490
<v 1>The bump 2% guaranteed drive. I feel called out now.</v>

41
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.330
<v 0>And they've all mean it so much that they're actually like proud of it when it's</v>

42
00:02:05.331 --> 00:02:08.540
like 2%, like they're practically giving the five stars away.

43
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.390
Like that's probably the only guaranteed draw.

44
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.390
Like a lot of the stuff. I've just,

45
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.600
I hate how games have just completely normalized. Like, you know,

46
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.280
micro-transactions to death. Yeah. Like I injured. It was fun, but like,

47
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.250
you know, I'd spent like 800 bucks on that game and they was still submissions.

48
00:02:25.251 --> 00:02:26.180
I couldn't do. And I'm like,

49
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.570
how much do I need to spend to be able to beat like do the hottest missions?

50
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.680
Tell me how much.

51
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.800
<v 1>Just, just turn your brain off and just enjoy the game.</v>

52
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.330
And you'll just enjoy the experience.

53
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.620
<v 0>Beep beep you got no resources left or do you want to pay?</v>

54
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:42.080
You want to play a little money to keep playing? Do you?

55
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.760
<v 1>I hate that.</v>

56
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.940
I would say the only real God you gave him playing right now is [inaudible]

57
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.940
. And my biggest problem of Kenshin has nothing to do with like the catches

58
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.940
 system. Even though the pull rates suck. But I mean, I never get like if, if 

59
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.940
the, if the, if the drop rates are, then I don't go into with a

60
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.940
 mentality of I'm going to get this character. I'm going to get this person. When you come in with X, 

61
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.940
when are you coming in with expectations? That's when you lose, okay. That's 

62
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.940
when you lose walking into a casino being like I'm going to win the jackpot. I

63
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.940
 actually biggest problem with Kenshin right now is that when you reach

64
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.940
 the end game, it really, it, it really feels like you reached

65
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.940
 the end game because you, you, you are squid

66
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:47.773
. Like you're squeezing out content. That's just not there.

67
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.310
It's become so apparent with Kenshin as opposed to other gadget games.

68
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.310
Cause I'm sure we've played enough games that when you reached that point,

69
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:35.050
right where you, you, you, you,

70
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:38.040
you had to open it to the dailies and you're like, I've got nothing to do.

71
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.610
This is just this just, this is just a part-time job. I'm grinding away.

72
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.840
I'm just watching numbers go up. But like it's, it's,

73
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.490
it's less noticeable when it's a phone game, but when it, when it's on Gunjan,

74
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.860
cause I don't know how people play Gunjan on the phone, man. How you doing?

75
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.360
How you do storm terror or the Wolf porcelain get on your phone.

76
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.250
That's that's beyond me. But like,

77
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:02.650
it feels so weird when I got to the end game against you.

78
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.880
And I would log on for like an hour, a day on the PC. And I would just like,

79
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.090
I would just grind and I will do nothing but grind. Cause I'd done.

80
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.580
I'd gone through all like the, the actual content of the game. And it really,

81
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.830
it really feels like it's really apparent on Kenshin because it feels

82
00:04:20.831 --> 00:04:25.180
like the first real Gachet game. That's like, that should be played on console.

83
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:29.170
And it feels more like an RPG. Whereas if it's a mobile game, I mean, you just,

84
00:04:29.171 --> 00:04:31.360
you can do it whenever, whenever you can do it in your free time.

85
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.371
<v 0>Yeah. Because I mean,</v>

86
00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:36.480
I definitely felt like when I was grinding arc nights and I was over leveled for

87
00:04:36.481 --> 00:04:38.640
a lot of things, even though I still couldn't beat some stages,

88
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.600
like the fact that cause you would do it daily because you've been conditioned

89
00:04:42.601 --> 00:04:43.980
to like get your daily rewards, man.

90
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.340
Getting them to the point where anytime any new content ever came out,

91
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.190
I steamrolled it like immediately. I was like,

92
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.130
well that was like two hours of fun. I waited three months for that.

93
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.940
<v 1>Content updates. I do feel like a bit like a Pavlov dog Pavlov's dog.</v>

94
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.570
You know what I mean? Where it's just like, Ooh, good content, good content.

95
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.800
<v 0>And it's just like, you can't like you can't on these games and like say,</v>

96
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.060
Oh man, yeah, it's super grindy. You know, the,

97
00:05:08.061 --> 00:05:10.350
the Microsoft actions are a little bit much whatever.

98
00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:12.870
And then people are always, you're so quick to like defend them. And I'm like,

99
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.810
just admit that it's. And what they're doing is like, you,

100
00:05:15.811 --> 00:05:18.180
you get a free game and then you ha you have to put up with this.

101
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.160
And they're like, well, I'm free to play. I don't give a.

102
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.460
If you're free to play. Other people are out there spending a thousand dollars.

103
00:05:23.461 --> 00:05:27.180
Why is it okay if it's just your free to play, that's always the excuse.

104
00:05:27.181 --> 00:05:30.570
You see the that drives me insane. And people like, as long as I'm not paying,

105
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.560
I'm like, what do you mean I'm free to play. I've never had any difficulties.

106
00:05:34.561 --> 00:05:37.860
It's like, well good on you that you have willpower. Like.

107
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.120
<v 1>I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm one of those people honestly free to play. No,</v>

108
00:05:42.121 --> 00:05:42.841
not free to play,

109
00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:46.050
but I I'll defend the fact that you can play these games being free to play

110
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.290
because all you need is willpower. And you know, if

111
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.000
[inaudible] is the power of friendship, that's all you need. I mean,

112
00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:56.730
if I wanted to, I could be free to play. I just don't want to.
