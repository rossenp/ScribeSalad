1
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.040
<v 0>You didn't have the East end, the two movies and gave all of them a nine.</v>

2
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.750
I really enjoyed it and have these really,

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.150
I think how we never talked about in one of these together, we never talked.

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.990
I love brings up. Never kids. No one ever brings that up. It's a great,

5
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.280
it's great first season,

6
00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:20.360
but like the movies just didn't conclude it in the way I wanted to. But again,

7
00:00:20.361 --> 00:00:21.194
both of them are nine though.

8
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.760
I thought you didn't have the East had one of the most interesting premises I

9
00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:28.850
watched since no one talks about you didn't have the East,

10
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.743
we're going to sell what you do.

11
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.750
<v 1>I remember, I, I remember my feelings for the show. I can't remember.</v>

12
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.000
<v 0>What happened. I have one memory.</v>

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.880
<v 1>Of this show and it was like a ship and a bunch of naked people.</v>

14
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.400
<v 0>Yeah. That's all I remember. None of the ending of it. Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:48.740
The ending of the first season of eating of the years was great. brilliant.

16
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.720
What is the premise again? Okay. So,

17
00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:54.860
so the premise is they have a smartphone and I can't remember exactly how much

18
00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:56.750
money they were given, but he had like 13,

19
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.260
13 people who were given these smartphones and on a smartphone,

20
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.820
you have like this AI that they could request anything to happen. Right.

21
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.620
And they were given a budget of, I think, 10, $10 million.

22
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.410
It was more than that. Was it like a million or 10 million, 10 billion,

23
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.810
10 billion yet, which is a hundred million dollars.

24
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.170
So they were given a budget of a hundred million dollars and all there was

25
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.710
there, all they were told was to save the world right there.

26
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:24.680
That that was their objective. And so,

27
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.360
and so the series is just the story of these different people and their own take

28
00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:34.160
on what a hundred million dollars means to save the world. And honestly,

29
00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:37.400
like, I don't want to spoil what happens, but it's great.

30
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:39.860
Especially the first 12 episodes. Just go

31
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.880
[inaudible] it's not just, it's not just 12 episodes.

32
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.140
It's 12 episodes and a movie, two movies, movies. Are you sure?

33
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.100
Are you sure it's two movies?

34
00:01:49.101 --> 00:01:52.580
Not just one because he gave both of them a nine out of 10. Okay.

35
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.570
But I feel like the first season was fantastic. Yeah.

36
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.220
It's and you know,

37
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.440
the problem with the first season is that it didn't conclude the story,

38
00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:03.350
but the first season was fantastic. Um,

39
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.790
the movies were not as good in my opinion. I don't,

40
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.390
I didn't even know they had movies.

41
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.100
I don't remember much about what happened in the movie.

42
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.130
<v 1>Some of these shows, I legitimately can't remember like fully watching.</v>

43
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.180
<v 0>Surprise you. What? Like you watch hint. I ordered the one on nickel,</v>

44
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.460
the Stony cat and the hint IOG. I did watch that. Yeah.

45
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.630
You want to keep it on the audio as well?

46
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.520
That doesn't seem like a show you would watch.

47
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.520
Why have we never talked about it? We want you to black bullet.

48
00:02:28.521 --> 00:02:32.450
You haven't rated it, but you've watched all of black Butler.

49
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.630
<v 1>I remember I actually do really enjoy like, uh,</v>

50
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.510
like romance slice of life shows, but I used to binge them all the time,

51
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.070
but not now I to black cat as well. Yeah. I blackout was though. Yeah.

52
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.270
The moment I watched catch him in crowds. And I remember I, that was,

53
00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:54.200
I gave that a six, but that was so reluctantly. I did not enjoy watching that.

54
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.270
And I watched, there's a bunch of other shows that I watch after this.

55
00:02:56.271 --> 00:02:58.640
I didn't include light. What's that card game, like WIC, salsa,

56
00:02:58.641 --> 00:02:59.474
whatever it's called. That was.

57
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.990
<v 0>I'm angry. I hated that. I watched that one save and watch that.</v>

58
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.660
<v 1>This is the thing, right? Is it to me? I didn't. I do not like looking up anime.</v>

59
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.730
Like I don't want to know anything about the show, right? Yeah.

60
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.040
Give me the show. Let me watch it. And if I hate it.

61
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.950
<v 0>Brain dead. Yeah. I want to read that monkey boat. Like.</v>

62
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.730
<v 1>Because here's the thing, right? I guarantee if you just give me a show,</v>

63
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.740
tell me to watch it. I'll watch it. I might enjoy it.

64
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.140
If you try and sell me on a show, I immediately will stop being like, Oh,

65
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.260
I don't know. No.

66
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.140
<v 0>I'm completely the opposite. I'm the opposite. Because like,</v>

67
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.060
I've gotten to the point where I need to be sold on the show because I

68
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.820
need to have like a reason why I'm watching this show.

69
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.890
Like AB is the show going to get good?

70
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.830
Am I going to have something that I get out of this show? I, I, I need to,

71
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.420
I need to know that before it gets loud,

72
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.640
before like truly gets into a show because otherwise,

73
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.220
nowadays I end up dropping shows after one episode.

74
00:03:50.221 --> 00:03:53.670
If it doesn't hook me even like critically acclaimed, highly claimed show. If I,

75
00:03:53.671 --> 00:03:55.950
if I don't know that something good is coming up,

76
00:03:55.951 --> 00:03:58.500
that's going to be worth my time that I'm just not going to give it a chance

77
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.170
because I just don't have that patience anymore.

78
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.580
I've I've sat through enough shows to know that I don't want to waste my time

79
00:04:05.581 --> 00:04:09.240
anymore. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Right. Um, you know, it's, it's, it's just,

80
00:04:09.241 --> 00:04:10.250
it's just sad. Cause I,

81
00:04:10.251 --> 00:04:13.950
I do miss that feeling of finding hidden gems where I can just be like, Oh,

82
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.150
I have zero expectations.

83
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.030
[inaudible].

84
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.880
<v 1>So that's an attempt if I, I haven't read that, but yeah.</v>

85
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.890
<v 0>I wish I, I wish I did. Okay. One, one, one thing that's curious to me,</v>

86
00:04:28.891 --> 00:04:30.210
you watch phase zero,

87
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.540
but you rated the second season lower than the first season. You mean the,

88
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.721
the,

89
00:04:35.721 --> 00:04:39.540
the actual action packed second season where everything gets concluded is lower

90
00:04:39.541 --> 00:04:42.780
than the first season, which is the setup. You're like,

91
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.210
you're like completely going against everything.

92
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.450
Like all the character buildup you've pulled yourself off too. Right? It's like,

93
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.170
Oh, I hate story. I love action. The season where there's more action.

94
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:53.130
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

95
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.870
I really enjoyed when they were introducing like all of the characters in fate.

96
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.810
That's what my favorite part. I'll fate, right?

97
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.500
Like fate feet stay night as well.

98
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.990
My favorite part of fates day night is when they introducing the characters

99
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.230
because it's so cool. Cause you're like, I know, I know there's an assassin.

100
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.960
I know there's a rider. What are they going to be? And then when,

101
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.150
and then when you watch fates day night, and you're like, wow, right.

102
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.450
His in this one compared to fate zero. Cause like fates here, you watch it.

103
00:05:15.451 --> 00:05:19.260
You're like, yo rider. He's the best Alex Sando I'd him. But like,

104
00:05:19.261 --> 00:05:22.980
then you watch then that's the reason why I hated fate stay night except for the

105
00:05:22.981 --> 00:05:23.814
animation.

106
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.870
Because I was like [inaudible] which face they know what you're talking.

107
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.650
<v 0>Yeah. The original face blade works. Okay. Okay. The series,</v>

108
00:05:31.651 --> 00:05:33.930
not the movies, right? The series. Because I'm not

109
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.240
[inaudible] I just need clarification because what you say fans will like on

110
00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:44.880
their seat. Right. Archer. Cool. But I can't believe.

111
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.040
<v 1>They had, like, there was no like good Alec.</v>

112
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.260
They should've just brought Aleksandar back gate and be like, Hey,

113
00:05:49.261 --> 00:05:52.740
I'm back baby. Or like, it's a free cool. So I guess like, Hey, I'm back.

114
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.280
<v 0>Yeah. Cause he was like the best part.</v>

115
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.050
<v 1>Of zero. If I got three seconds.</v>

116
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.610
<v 0>He was the best part of phase zero. Yeah. Yeah. He was.</v>

117
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.460
<v 1>This relationship with the, uh, the weevil,</v>

118
00:06:09.461 --> 00:06:12.850
whatever it's called load the weasel waiver, waiver, whatever the it is.

119
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.240
<v 0>I believe that's a rodent, honestly.</v>

120
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:21.093
That's probably why.

121
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.920
<v 1>That's what he is. Uh, what's another thing that I gave. What I don't,</v>

122
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:24.581
I disagree with that.

123
00:06:24.581 --> 00:06:27.130
There's a lot of ones that you haven't given them darker than black.

124
00:06:27.131 --> 00:06:30.490
I stand by being a nine because if you watch the DOB dude, Troy bakers in that,

125
00:06:30.491 --> 00:06:33.400
this is before Troy Baker stopped doing anime. I'm like, man.

126
00:06:33.401 --> 00:06:34.810
He kills it as November 11.

127
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.890
<v 0>So fun. I like talking to them.</v>

128
00:06:37.891 --> 00:06:40.780
Black is a show that I've actually rewatched quite a few times.

129
00:06:40.781 --> 00:06:43.480
And I don't know why we watch it quite a few times. I've really,

130
00:06:43.481 --> 00:06:46.360
I just really liked the world of dark and I'm blessed. Yeah. You know what?

131
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.860
I'm not going to lie. I don't remember anything.

132
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.360
<v 1>Thought it was actually cool and weird. Cause. Cause like it was Lee.</v>

133
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.900
<v 0>Watching and it was like X-Men but what I found interesting was the fact that</v>

134
00:06:55.901 --> 00:06:59.120
they had to like do this really weird activity every time. Yeah.

135
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.510
I'd like to know smoking. Yeah. I don't know why.

136
00:07:01.511 --> 00:07:04.210
I just thought that was really good. Cool. And like it has an,

137
00:07:04.211 --> 00:07:07.230
a amazing soundtrack as well. Cause it was like by YOKA CARNA,

138
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.020
I feel like one of the biggest differences between the first season,

139
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.450
every other season was Yoko Connor's music.

140
00:07:13.451 --> 00:07:18.340
Just set such an amazing tone for this world and this environment that it just

141
00:07:18.341 --> 00:07:23.170
made. You just, it, it just felt good exploring this world and just being in it.

142
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.090
<v 1>Yeah. It's fun, dude. I'm watching dude like the dumps really good.</v>

143
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.250
<v 0>I get you're saying this to Joey now. Honestly.</v>

144
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:32.950
<v 1>Honestly dude like Troy Baker is November 11th.</v>

145
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:34.691
<v 0>I love Troy biker.</v>

146
00:07:34.691 --> 00:07:39.210
So you'll sell me on because Baker plays the guy who has to smoke. Yeah. Yeah.

147
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.750
I've I've watched the debate as well. Oh good God.
