WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.300
<v 0>Speaking of like giving like five stars and one stars and stuff like that.</v>

2
00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:07.470
Have we ever talked about what, like the reviewing mentality is here in Japan?

3
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:08.973
Just everything.

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.180
<v 1>I noticed that right away when I moved here. Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.100
How like nothing on Amazon is above.

6
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.290
<v 0>Yeah. It's not just not on Amazon.</v>

7
00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:18.050
Like everything on like Google or Google maps. Yeah. Stuffing.

8
00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:22.730
If like hardly anything is above four stars. It's like,

9
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.390
mostly is then it's only like two reviews. Right. And also like.

10
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.580
<v 1>Uh, so they do use Google reviews, uh, mainly for like restaurants and stuff,</v>

11
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.660
but there's also a thing called Tagalog that they like a lot of people think

12
00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:37.900
that food critics use and it should be.

13
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.260
<v 0>Like the Yelp of Japan. Basically. It's.</v>

14
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.480
<v 1>Insane because it's like,</v>

15
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.950
these people review these food restaurants and like three stars for a restaurant

16
00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:49.090
is considered good. Yeah. That's like, it's done it. It's, it's impressive.

17
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.730
<v 0>Because I remember when I first moved to Japan and whenever you'd look up</v>

18
00:00:52.731 --> 00:00:56.840
restaurants and Google, you see like three, 3.5 stars,

19
00:00:56.841 --> 00:01:00.380
maybe the occasional four and in England or in America,

20
00:01:00.381 --> 00:01:03.170
when I see a three-star restaurant, I'm like, yo,

21
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.840
something's gone wrong for that. I'm just like,

22
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.370
[inaudible] man. Like, I don't know. I don't understand.

23
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.540
I don't understand what that is.

24
00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:14.870
Like do the Japanese think that the stars on Google reviews like Michelin stars,

25
00:01:14.871 --> 00:01:17.450
like, cause I mean, I understand it because they actually,

26
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.350
I respect that they have a mentality where they literally actually used every

27
00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:24.710
star in the review system. Cause it's like the mal review. Right?

28
00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:28.910
Where anything below, like, I I'm pretty sure like mallow 70. Yeah.

29
00:01:28.911 --> 00:01:30.020
I'm pretty sure like Maldon,

30
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.280
mal users don't realize that fi like under five stars actually exist. Um,

31
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.690
because it's either like seven, if it's good. Um, six is really bad.

32
00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:42.740
Six is really bad. Like five is the most awful animators.

33
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.290
Every restaurant I, the way I am.

34
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.570
<v 1>I imagine it is like, what would I tell the owner?</v>

35
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.280
If he was right in front of me now? Like,

36
00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:52.640
would I genuinely sit there and be like, this is a three-star experience.

37
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.160
<v 0>You know what I mean? Like how are you going to.</v>

38
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.040
<v 1>Do that to the poor guys? Should I run a business? Right? Yeah. It's just to me,</v>

39
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.190
you know, if I go somewhere, I really like the food.

40
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.760
I have nothing bad about it. How in good faith. Can I be like, yeah,

41
00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:06.500
you don't deserve five stalls. Yeah.

42
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.750
<v 0>Because there was nothing wrong with it. Like this.</v>

43
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.950
<v 1>Was exactly what I wanted. I got what I needed. Yeah. It wasn't fine dining.</v>

44
00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:13.850
It wasn't crazy. Yeah.

45
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.550
<v 0>Like there was nothing. Oh, sorry. I was going to say it like,</v>

46
00:02:16.551 --> 00:02:19.610
that's the thing I want to ask about these like super harsh Japanese reviews,

47
00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:22.070
right? It's like, what is a five-star? Yeah. It's like,

48
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.460
do you want a blow job from the chefs? Like also another thing where like you,

49
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:26.803
how can you judge.

50
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.600
<v 1>Really a restaurant the same way? McDonald's.</v>

51
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.010
<v 0>Yeah, because like, Hey,</v>

52
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.940
because what I was going to say is even like the fine dining restaurants are the

53
00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:39.740
same because they expect a fine dining experience.

54
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.770
So if they get the fine dining experience,

55
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.100
that's the standard that you've done the job.

56
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.330
And so that makes me wonder what the would a fine dining restaurant have to do

57
00:02:50.331 --> 00:02:51.890
to get a four or five star? Man.

58
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.560
<v 1>It blows my mind because like, like I said,</v>

59
00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:58.100
like comparing McDonald's to like a fine dining experience because they really

60
00:02:58.101 --> 00:03:02.200
shouldn't be on the same. Right. Cause that totally different things. Yeah.

61
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.840
So when you go to McDonald's, what are you judging about?

62
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:08.020
McDonald's are you judging the place, the food? What are you judging?

63
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.550
Because the food isn't going to change really?

64
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.680
It's probably not going to be any different.

65
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.450
<v 0>The only thing that determines a good McDonald's experience or a bad one,</v>

66
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.463
it's like how fast?

67
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.210
<v 1>Yeah. This is what I see on Google reviews.</v>

68
00:03:18.211 --> 00:03:20.580
I'll see a two-star McDonald's and I'll see a four-star and I'm like,

69
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.810
what is the difference? Not like, ultimately I cannot tell the difference. Yes.

70
00:03:24.811 --> 00:03:26.010
It might be dirty or whatever.

71
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.030
<v 0>Less fries than I ordered last time. That's what confuses me.</v>

72
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.870
<v 1>Because then I'm then I'm also like, okay,</v>

73
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.500
so if I rate this McDonald's a five star, uh,

74
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.950
what am I reading at a five-star off? Am I rating it on a five-star because.

75
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.350
<v 0>The other McDonald's compared to a bigger question is who the is raiding</v>

76
00:03:43.351 --> 00:03:44.280
McDonald's and pupil.

77
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.080
<v 1>Okay. Ducks would be rude, but you know, people who are like, yeah,</v>

78
00:03:52.081 --> 00:03:56.100
see it's my only fine dining experience. I will review every McDonald's right.

79
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.420
<v 0>People would call McDonald's a restaurant. The same people will call motels,</v>

80
00:04:00.421 --> 00:04:01.290
hotels, you know?

81
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.900
<v 1>No, it's the, every single, like really, really high rated place in Japan,</v>

82
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.800
like four or five, four or 0.5 Ohio. Yeah.

83
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.620
There's normally light and disgusting. Wait time to get the food. Yeah.

84
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.010
Because when you get to that star in Japan,

85
00:04:17.011 --> 00:04:19.080
I feel like you get like it almost like a fandom,

86
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.990
like a hype around a cold following. Yeah.

87
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.690
So then everyone starts telling everyone just like, yo, yo,

88
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.110
you gotta get there early. You gotta line up. And it's like, well.

89
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.630
Now I can't enjoy the place. I got to make it three.

90
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.880
<v 0>Date events resume. I noticed that as well,</v>

91
00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:35.670
where there's Japan's restaurant culture.

92
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.680
Especially if something is like highly acclaimed,

93
00:04:37.681 --> 00:04:42.180
it all spreads via word of mouth. Japanese love lining up. I don't know.

94
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.120
I don't get that as a British training.

95
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.040
I can appreciate a good Q a but there's as a British person,

96
00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:52.800
I can appreciate a good queue as well, but not to a restaurant.

97
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.520
You know what I mean? I can't stand cues, dude. Yeah. If I want to,

98
00:04:56.521 --> 00:05:00.120
if I want to go to a good restaurant, that's exclusive, please. Let me book it,

99
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.090
please. Please. Don't I don't want another gutter system.

100
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.290
I don't want to line up.

101
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.820
I want just to have a booking and a specific time I turn up,

102
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.230
um, or you could be like us and try to book a table at Denny's

103
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.060
and completely fail. Cause we,

104
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.690
cause we always eat Denny's before we record a podcast and we had like, Oh,

105
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.520
one of the guests over and we're like, Oh.

106
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.400
That's a lot of people we might have to book a table at Denny's.

107
00:05:26.401 --> 00:05:29.160
So we were like, which to, to give context,

108
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.840
it's like trying to book a table at McDonald's.

109
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.990
So Marlene called up Denny's and was like, ah, can we book a table for six?

110
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.890
And the guy came back and was like, this is a Denny's.

111
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.100
Why are you trying to book a table? Just come to the restaurant.

112
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.340
This is Denny's. Who was it? It wasn't like,

113
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.280
like he caught it. He caught like the manager or something. It was like, wait.

114
00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.533
Yeah,

115
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.110
we went to, they do reservations. Yeah. Danny Danny's so exclusive.

116
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:04.250
You have to turn up on the day.

117
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.670
It's it's it's the most polite way you can just say it's a Denny's.

118
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:09.440
Why are you calling what the wrong with.

119
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.600
<v 1>Going back to like normal reviews of products? Like all the products.</v>

120
00:06:13.601 --> 00:06:14.860
I like that as well. And like,

121
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.280
if you see something with fully five stars on Amazon with over like 20 reviews,

122
00:06:18.281 --> 00:06:20.590
you're like, this must be like the. Yeah.

123
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.940
Because they're paying for those reviews. Cause I remember when I was buying,

124
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.770
like going back last week, buying a bed,

125
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.550
I could not find a bed over like three stars on Amazon.

126
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.240
I remember that like there was no bed that was about three stars. And I'm like,

127
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.720
who, how many problems we will have them with beds. And I would go to the, uh,

128
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.400
the reviews to read what they were saying.

129
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.820
And they were all saying that the build was too long. And that was the problem.

130
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.590
<v 0>I've had. I've had some of the most pedantic reviews of Japanese hammers.</v>

131
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.460
I've I've had like, someone wants our product because the packaging was bad.

132
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.590
It's completely fine. The packaging was a bit off. So they were like,

133
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.880
once that's what drives me.

134
00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.730
<v 1>Insane is that they,</v>

135
00:06:58.731 --> 00:07:02.710
they almost always review this around what you're actually reviewing. Yeah.

136
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:04.750
<v 0>All the delivery man had a bad attitude.</v>

137
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.360
<v 1>It's. Like I, if the package is a little beat up, but the thing's totally fine.</v>

138
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.660
Yeah.

139
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.400
<v 0>Fantastic. Are going to throw out the packaging anyway.</v>

140
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.870
<v 1>Like as long as I can use the thing I need. So what, like, I,</v>

141
00:07:16.871 --> 00:07:20.980
this shouldn't be a blight on the company that sent me it. Like, this is absurd.
