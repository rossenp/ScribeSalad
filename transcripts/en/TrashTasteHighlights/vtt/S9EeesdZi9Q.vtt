00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.390
<v 0>I don't know. I feel like it's really hard to have a bad taxi journey. Oh,</v>

2
00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:06.150
there's someone give you a one-star ones as a customer on Uber.

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.030
And I was confused because I don't think I've, haven't done anything in a call,

4
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:12.720
but maybe I did something that like ruined this man's day and he gave me a

5
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:13.350
one-stop.

6
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.460
<v 1>Oh, wow. Yeah. I didn't even know. I had one really.</v>

7
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.340
<v 2>Memorable, uh, Uber ride in LA. Uh,</v>

8
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.220
and it was again from where we were staying to the convention center,

9
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.580
it was like, yeah, again, another like five, 10 minute ride. And, uh,

10
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.140
and this massive Jeep rocks off, and there's only two of us. I'm like, okay,

11
00:00:30.141 --> 00:00:32.870
that's a bit overkill, but whatever. Okay. Jump in. And it's just this,

12
00:00:32.871 --> 00:00:36.590
like the biggest black dude I've ever seen. Like he's got like, not,

13
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.480
not like fat, like built like pretty. Right. And he's just like,

14
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.230
are you Joey? Right? I'm like, yup. And it's like LA convention center.

15
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.720
All right. I got you like, you know, like super chill.

16
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.400
And so the car drives off like two minutes later and he's like a, oh,

17
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.960
you mind if I put on some music, I'm like, yeah, man, whatever you want.

18
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.440
Yeah. Was like, yeah man, whatever you want. It's all good. And he's like,

19
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.500
all right, cool. He turns on something. Right. And you know,

20
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.820
there's a million different artists.

21
00:01:04.821 --> 00:01:09.140
You can envision a person like that might listen to. Right. It was like,

22
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.870
oh yeah, this is like, you know, it could be any like hardcore hip hop,

23
00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:15.200
whatever. Right. Whatever the dude thinks. So in your comes off

24
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.703
like

25
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.610
a Terry crews moment. You're like white chicks. And I'm just like,

26
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.390
I just started laughing. Like I couldn't help. I'm like, if I laugh,

27
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.780
this man might kill me, but this is just too funny. And I'm like,

28
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.530
you like in your home. And he's like, yeah, it helps me to relax, dude.

29
00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:41.420
That's amazing. That was great. It was so cool. And that's the thing though.

30
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.270
I didn't know if he was like trying to make me laugh or he was actually being

31
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:47.900
serious, but either way I was like, you know what? I can get into this. Oh,

32
00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:52.670
this is a really cool man. Maybe break. Listen to the menu.

33
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.510
<v 0>Uber driver. And just troll people with music. Oh yeah. I would as well.</v>

34
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.610
And if I put my favorite music on just lays light.

35
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.850
<v 2>Watching star opening. No, if I get a new vagina,</v>

36
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.300
if I become a diva driver anime, Oprah use only animate.

37
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.910
<v 0>I was upset. I said, I was hearing your story. I was like,</v>

38
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.520
have I ever given an Uber driver? A one star? I don't think so.

39
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.980
Because that was my only one. So to me, it's like,

40
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.330
five-star is like encompasses everything from the best experience to my life.

41
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.480
To you got me there in one piece. Yeah. All-star is like,

42
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.950
you literally broke down. You yourself. The cost stinks.

43
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.310
You've killed someone. You, you hit a dog as well. All right.

44
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.270
Four styles that I've just never used a one-star might didn't even know it was

45
00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:33.310
an option. You know, I thought there was.

46
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.480
<v 2>This is zero stars as well. Right. Then you can give,</v>

47
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.250
what does someone have to do to get zero stars? I mean like the one,

48
00:02:43.251 --> 00:02:47.150
the worst Uber ride that me and AKI went on was in France, in Paris,

49
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.700
Uber and France. Yeah. And this man almost actually got us into a car accident.

50
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.810
The French drivers are not stupid.

51
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.410
I remember he was shouting at everybody in like the,

52
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.670
like the kind of like start, stop kind of driving where I'm just like, bro,

53
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:02.470
I'm going to be sick all over this color. Yeah.

54
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.960
And he got us there and he was like, okay.

55
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.410
<v 1>Okay. We're here for, you know, whatever. I was just like, all right, man,</v>

56
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.693
zero stars.

57
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.800
<v 0>You got scammed in like Italy, right? Uh, yeah, almost.</v>

58
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.923
<v 1>Like in like.</v>

59
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.850
<v 0>A lot of, uh, a lot of European countries, uh, except for like, I don't know,</v>

60
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.860
Germany is pretty good for it. I mean a lot of the,

61
00:03:22.861 --> 00:03:25.370
like I think like Prague pretty bad for it and places like that. Yeah.

62
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.430
I like the taxi drivers, mad scam. You and you gotta be like, it sucks.

63
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.120
Cause it's the most and Japanese thing out of it.

64
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.830
You just gotta be like no final pain. That actual.

65
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.930
<v 3>Fact, like this is ridiculous. Yeah. So.</v>

66
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.350
<v 2>We landed in, uh, in Rome airport. Um,</v>

67
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.580
and there was just a dude outside of the gate just to be like taxi, taxi.

68
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.920
I know you're tourists. Yeah. Because they know it's for us. Right.

69
00:03:46.921 --> 00:03:50.050
And we were with Archies parents as well. So hockey's dad was like, yeah, yeah,

70
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.300
sure. You know, cause he's an Uber driver and he's like how much to this hotel.

71
00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.800
And he looks, and he goes, oh, 50, 50 Euro. And we're like, all right, whatever.

72
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.840
So then he takes us to like the back of the airport where like, it's like right.

73
00:04:03.841 --> 00:04:05.550
Opposite where the hanger is. Right.

74
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.620
And there's just this van and we get into this van and he's like, okay,

75
00:04:10.621 --> 00:04:14.040
hold on. I call my driver and the guy off and we'd left in this van.

76
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.140
And the longer we look around this van, we were like,

77
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.830
we gotta get the out of this van. They're like, this is, this is not a taxi.

78
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.080
Because then I looked up like, you know, standard Italian, like taxi Fest.

79
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.030
<v 3>To the airport from the hotel.</v>

80
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.200
<v 2>And we're like a normal, like taxi ride is like 20 years. Yeah.</v>

81
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.090
And just is charging 50. And we're like.

82
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.030
<v 0>Don't, don't listen to those in Europe, man.</v>

83
00:04:36.031 --> 00:04:37.980
Like that they'll they'll try and get you away.

84
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.050
Cause it's always going to be like an official taxi stand.

85
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.530
<v 2>So we, so we immediately, like, we didn't even wait for them.</v>

86
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.000
We just like grabbed that. Got out,

87
00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:47.820
went to the regular taxi stand and we're like, all right, thank God.

88
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.530
<v 3>I mean,</v>

89
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.960
I'm pretty sure for like any country you want to go to the official taxi staff.

90
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.440
<v 0>Or some countries have way stricter rules on taxis than others. And like,</v>

91
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.960
even if you get one, somebody ran up, you're pretty. Yes.

92
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.970
A lot of countries you'll still get like I'm in Japan. You get,

93
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.990
you get to anyway, you're going to get the standard fare. Right, right. Same in,

94
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.770
uh, Germany and UK as well. I'm pretty sure it was well something, but yeah.

95
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.170
<v 2>Yeah. We learned our lesson that we were about to get,</v>

96
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.240
I don't know where the this guy was going to take it.

97
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.160
Literally what they warn against as you're a kid.

98
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.640
[inaudible]
