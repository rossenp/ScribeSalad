00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.560
<v 0>Speaking of like little seasonal and regional stuff that you can only get in</v>

2
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:05.394
Japan.

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.970
Has there been anything you've like any little products or anything you've

4
00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:12.900
missed from home or from any other country at all that you have to like actively

5
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:16.830
get a craving for? I know you have Kona. My parents.

6
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.900
<v 1>Shipped out pot noodles to me because I do like that rom and cutting.</v>

7
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.350
<v 0>I die. I die a little inside whenever I hear Conor say that.</v>

8
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.780
<v 1>Because right. It's no, I don't. I'm not saying that the pot noodles in the UK,</v>

9
00:00:29.781 --> 00:00:32.570
which would be on screen are better than the ones in Japan.

10
00:00:32.571 --> 00:00:35.780
I don't think that the Japanese ones are superior in every way,

11
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.480
but there's something familiar and comforting about. Yes.

12
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.430
And also it's very spicy,

13
00:00:40.431 --> 00:00:45.030
which unfortunately the non-normal yeah, yeah.

14
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.460
Three spicy. It's good. I love it.

15
00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:49.580
And so my parents are Christmas because you know, I, you know, I have,

16
00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:51.710
since you start making your own money, it's like, right. Well, I,

17
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.430
I buy everything I want for myself. Right. So they're like, what can we get you?

18
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:56.930
And I'm like, well, you can get me something.

19
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.840
I can't get myself and not love none of that.

20
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.580
The pot noodles from the UK. And they're like pot noodles, like, yes,

21
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.350
please send me pot noodles. Okay.

22
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.520
<v 0>So they did. Yeah. I always, I always asked my parents to see me like, uh,</v>

23
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.530
like Australian sweets and stuff. You can get 10 times here. They suck. Anyway.

24
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.510
Now what you don't like 10 times they're overrated. I tell every Australian,

25
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.010
every Australian, Australian swears by them,

26
00:01:25.011 --> 00:01:27.550
like it's like national pride or something. It is national pride.

27
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.530
And I'm just like awesome. Just the biscuit. Oh my goodness.

28
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.520
<v 1>I just, I think biscuit is like the most underwhelming sweet, like it's,</v>

29
00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:38.480
it's hard. It's never satisfying.

30
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.870
It is like soft cookies are way better than hard cookies as well. Like I.

31
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.950
<v 0>No, I get, I get that. I get that. But like, we also have like, wait,</v>

32
00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:49.340
so do you guys consider Tim Tams to be hard cookies? No biscuits.

33
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.300
Biscuits are hard biscuits or what's the difference?

34
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.710
Cause that's a soft biscuit to us.

35
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.140
Cause we have these things you want even rocks for harvest.

36
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.650
We have these things called Anzac cookies, which are literally rocks.

37
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.530
Like I don't want to have to worry, break teeth, trying to eat.

38
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.980
That's not a cookie. If I have to worry about bracing,

39
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.130
if I have to worry about breaking my teeth, it's not a cookie.

40
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.700
And it's like biscuits a like Australians watching this window as a biscuit.

41
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.880
It's a awesome. Just almost like a health hazard without hazard.

42
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.400
It's like chewing. It's like, dude,

43
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.940
you can work out your jawline eating this sparking cookie. Like it's so tough.

44
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.910
<v 1>Growing up. I still have, these are the UK obviously,</v>

45
00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:28.070
but they're called the gestures. Did you like those.

46
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160
<v 0>Suggested digestive biscuits, tiny chip.</v>

47
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.560
That is not appealing at all. I realize that's not very fitting. Yeah.

48
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.530
They were Wharf. I'd never liked that.

49
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.620
It's just like the most plain biscuit you can get.

50
00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:45.250
And it's got like a soft layer of chocolate covered on top.

51
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.220
<v 1>The chocolate is chocolate. The biscuit is like dry,</v>

52
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.760
like a milk biscuit or no, no, no, no, no. It's like a wheat biscuit. Yeah.

53
00:02:52.761 --> 00:02:54.250
That's what it looks like. Yeah.

54
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:55.281
<v 0>Oh God,</v>

55
00:02:55.281 --> 00:03:00.190
that doesn't look good because you're supposed to like dip with tea and

56
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.590
coffee and stuff like that.

57
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.010
<v 1>Dip it in your hot tea and it falls apart and your T's ruined.</v>

58
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.070
But you can do that with a Tim Tam as well. I don't want to put any.

59
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.770
<v 0>There's too much chocolates put in the TBS.</v>

60
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.370
There needs to be like a perfect chocolate ratio. Chocolate. The biscuit ratio,

61
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.320
because Tim Sam's like covered in chocolate.

62
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.500
Chocolate starts melting on your fingers as you dip it in and see that's that's

63
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.820
like, you never done a Tim Tam stroll before

64
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.600
you haven't done a flipper. So kangaroo Australian culture for you. All right.

65
00:03:30.601 --> 00:03:31.860
So you get a team. So it's like,

66
00:03:31.861 --> 00:03:34.620
usually you do it with a cup of tea or a cup of coffee, whatever you prefer,

67
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.560
you get a team time. You bite both ends off. Right.

68
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.730
And then you use it as a straw to suck up your tea and coffee. And it's awesome.

69
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.950
Is this some down on the joke?

70
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.340
[inaudible].

71
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.610
<v 1>What is something a culture? When is it just like stupid? Like.</v>

72
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.780
<v 0>It's what we do. That's what some people do. I did it once and I was like, yeah,</v>

73
00:03:57.781 --> 00:04:01.470
that's cool. I don't do it every time, but it's just a little thing you can do.

74
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.240
Yeah. I don't know. I got to find their own fun in Australia right there.

75
00:04:06.241 --> 00:04:10.980
Isn't a lot to do, but I've like, I don't like biscuits at all.

76
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.700
<v 1>It's definitely like the worst. I'm not really fond of cookies either.</v>

77
00:04:14.701 --> 00:04:18.410
I think cookies server, because UK cookies are just. No, no, no, no.

78
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:21.930
<v 0>Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, come on. The</v>

79
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.420
store brand cookies are always fresh cookies out the oven when they're like,

80
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.460
they need to be soft chewy. I don't know. Okay. My favorite cookies I can get.

81
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.190
I actually, um, subway cookies,

82
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.010
cookies are great. You like the ones where you can pull it easily.

83
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.980
If it's not fresh out the oven.

84
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.780
What I hate is if I bite in a cookie and it conscious goes everywhere. And

85
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.670
if I have crumbs that I'm like this, this is a cookie.

86
00:04:53.671 --> 00:04:56.610
This is just a biscuit with extra steps. You know what I mean?

87
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.950
Fiscal with attitude. I like my cookies to be goofy. I like it to be soft,

88
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.360
not going to lie. I've never thought that deeply about.

89
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.790
<v 1>You know, you grew up in the UK, you're watching American cartoons.</v>

90
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.570
If for some reason in American cartoons, cookies alike, like I don't know.

91
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.260
W the, the, the, the, the thing that fueled the world for kids,

92
00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:18.390
generation cookies were what? The,

93
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.930
like the Mayans used to barter and negotiate.

94
00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.220
These kids shows me cookies to be like the godsend of like everything.

95
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.950
So when I, you know, you grow up and you can stop buying your own things.

96
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.530
You're like, well, yeah. I mean, cookies are the best treat.

97
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.480
Then you start having them. You're like, wait, these are kind of.

98
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.320
<v 0>Oh. It was, it was always like, you know, that mythical cookie jar, right.</v>

99
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.100
Have it in my house. So I assume everybody else has one.

100
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.190
<v 1>It was just like, cookies were like, insanely like valuable, you know,</v>

101
00:05:44.191 --> 00:05:48.450
kids are dying, fighting Wars on the playground currency. Literally it's,

102
00:05:48.451 --> 00:05:48.990
you know.

103
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.321
<v 0>Cause like, for me,</v>

104
00:05:49.321 --> 00:05:51.990
whenever I get like bakes cookies or someone who cooks fresh cookies,

105
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.570
there's like, as soon as it comes out, the oven,

106
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.490
the timer starts because yeah, exactly. Cause you,

107
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.310
cause you got to be like 100% cookie speed. Right. I gotta,

108
00:06:01.311 --> 00:06:04.430
I gotta like enjoy this before it starts hardening. And it's like,

109
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.510
as soon as thoughts, harden,

110
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.280
it's one of the few objects in the world where moist is a positive adjective.

111
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.780
You know what I mean? I get that.

112
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:16.121
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

113
00:06:16.121 --> 00:06:19.000
I feel bad when people like make cookies like the day before and they bring them

114
00:06:19.001 --> 00:06:21.430
to like, you want to try one of my home bake cookies. I'm like, I could,

115
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.400
I could try one of your home baked cookies, but I will be solely disappointed.

116
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.390
<v 0>And brownies. Like if I have like a dry brownie, it's like a,</v>

117
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.373
it's like a limp Dick.

118
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.690
<v 1>Okay. So brownie brownie does need to be a little like.</v>

119
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.040
<v 0>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</v>

120
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.950
<v 1>If at all that just crumbles apart. When I touch it, I'm like,</v>

121
00:06:38.951 --> 00:06:40.440
well the structural integrity.

122
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.850
<v 0>Sprout is a pole. If it's flaky, then it's not making like a sound as</v>

123
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.690
if it's not making that sound. That it's a bad Brown.

124
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.870
I can't be the only one who thinks that it needs to be like ASM,

125
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.720
all levels of light smacking in your ears.

126
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.800
<v 1>The deal supermarkets in Australia, like have bakery sections.</v>

127
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.100
Are they with big things like in the UK to be fair,

128
00:07:06.101 --> 00:07:08.740
they used to make pretty good cookies and brownies. Do you want,

129
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.320
I'm trying to think, sir, wait. Sainsbury's like,

130
00:07:11.321 --> 00:07:12.760
Sainsbury's just have their own bakery.

131
00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.691
<v 0>Okay. See, okay.</v>

132
00:07:13.691 --> 00:07:16.600
I've I've actually got I've actually like I know the best ones it goes

133
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.710
Sainsbury's then Tesco's then co-op cause those, those,

134
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.540
these all satellite just made up names.

135
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.040
<v 1>The supermarket chains in the UK, all of them have their own bakery.</v>

136
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.320
And like you get like full fat cookies.

137
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.850
They were always like freshly baked on the day and soft and they were good.

138
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.880
They were good. You could buy the packaged ones, but like,

139
00:07:36.881 --> 00:07:39.970
why would you do that when you could go and get like a full box of brownies,

140
00:07:39.971 --> 00:07:42.820
like 16 little chunks for like a quid. Right.

141
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.810
<v 0>Pretty good. Yeah. That sounds way better.</v>
