00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.630
<v 0>No. Chris just told us how he ate a bag last week.</v>

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.030
Almost like walking through the forest. I went, Oh,

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.600
I'll get my knife and fork out and eat it in,

4
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:12.990
in our Maury North Japan bears. Cause there's too many. Actually.

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.390
There's too many guys I've been there before. How was it?

6
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.960
What does it taste like? Not good. A part of me feels sad, but then why,

7
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:20.820
why would I feel sad about a bad, not other animals. I don't,

8
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.380
I don't know about you, but you did you have it as like a proper dish? I cooked,

9
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.370
yeah. I cooked on a grill. Ah, cause I had it in. I can sounds,

10
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.740
sounds terrible. Terrible. How is it?

11
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.890
Is it just very gaming? It's very, it's very fatty.

12
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.100
It's it's um, it's like beef.

13
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.990
It's so disgusting. Beef. That's very hard.

14
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.400
It's like chewing on level essentially. Like when did you get this from?

15
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.620
You can give them the supermarket. Yeah.

16
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.040
I mean you underestimate like how many different types of choice it was.

17
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.690
He was also like I was in,

18
00:00:56.691 --> 00:01:00.920
how could I say they were just selling whale camp and that's very controversial.

19
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.970
You can, you can get like dolphin sat there. I mean,

20
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.360
cause it's one half it's like, you don't want to be like, Hey Tran,

21
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.730
stop doing that because it's, you know, it's your culture.

22
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.740
But on the other half, please stop killing whales. The subject of bears.

23
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.060
There's a lot of bloody bears that run wild and go into towns,

24
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.660
especially at the moment because a lot of the rural population is going down and

25
00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:26.360
towns are actually becoming quite empty, especially in places like hockey.

26
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.100
And there's a light there's going to be there. I'm going to get in.

27
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.590
I'm going to get a piece of the, I think it's sort of,

28
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.060
it's not this cover sheet then they're like,

29
00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:35.540
well the can just leave it for dead or we could eat. And then they sell it.

30
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.310
Whereas like I think this year there was like the most amount of bear attacks in

31
00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:42.380
like the last like 10, 15 years or something.

32
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.320
But in Hokkaido they have Brown bears on the mainland.

33
00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:47.030
We've just only got black bears, which are kind of small.

34
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.660
Not they only eat like for

35
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.183
[inaudible] vegetable

36
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.900
[inaudible] but the Brown bears in Hokkaido. When I was driving,

37
00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:05.330
I showed a bunch of signs. You didn't see anybody? I didn't see any,

38
00:02:05.331 --> 00:02:06.290
but there was signs everywhere.

39
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.050
They're like 20 people camping on Hokkaido to bed.

40
00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:12.380
Just turn up and ate everyone, everyone, everyone, they all die.

41
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.480
The feast lucky bag. How do you defend yourself from a bear attack in Japan?

42
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.780
Cause Lisa's like America. You people can carry guns, bear spray.

43
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.220
[inaudible] does it work? Does anyone like pepper spray for bears?

44
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.650
I think by the time the bag gets so close, you're already kind of.

45
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.170
It's gotta be like, Oh, I've got my spray. If it hits you, you're dead.

46
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.250
Chris brought, I read it. I read an article that a,

47
00:02:43.251 --> 00:02:47.930
there was a bear turned up on, uh, uh, Oh, an orchard in Elmore.

48
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.210
It was lots of apples. And they were like, just doing the orchard. You know,

49
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.600
you want your D like a farmer and the bear just turned up. I was like, ah,

50
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.720
and this old man just went and just punched it in the face of the bed was like,

51
00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.023
just ran away.

52
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.860
So you defended yourself against the bed. Just punch it.

53
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.010
Where's Chris broad punching a bad video.

54
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.840
That's I want to raise the level this year. I did say

55
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.120
I like that would be a low change from a bear. I liked that. Uh,

56
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.530
you know that they're nice.

57
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.020
It's hard because I think a lot of audiences would see that and would be a bit

58
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.880
part off. And it's kind of hard to,

59
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.340
I guess there are a lot of things like that where it's like,

60
00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:28.380
you do want to kind of be like, well, this is what they do.

61
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.830
And this is how they've always done it. I guess it's almost like,

62
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.840
who are you to say? They can't do it, but at times again,

63
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.750
it's like the whale stuff, right? It's like, yeah, it's pretty iffy.

64
00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:41.100
It's difficult subjects I had whale wants to know to never have oil. Again.

65
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.360
It doesn't even, it doesn't even taste good. No cruel. Isn't it. I felt so.

66
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.520
I was like, well, you know, I was served at an eight. What was that as well?

67
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.910
It's like, Oh, that's very sad. Now. I hated knowing what it was.

68
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.451
And I was just like,

69
00:03:54.451 --> 00:03:56.790
I don't even like the post because I can't even get behind it. Anyway,

70
00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.130
most countries have agreed to stop it. And Japan just like

71
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.320
[inaudible], it's not that popular in Japan. The reason it

72
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.320
 still does well is the, uh,

73
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.320
the politicians in power, their areas rush for whale and they kind of have

74
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.320
 to get voted. It's all political. It's not because people actually normally 

75
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.320
have the taste away. A lot of the older generation do like still

76
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.320
 a lot of them like grow up, eating it after world war two, there

77
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.320
 was a lot of whales. So the same thing with dolphins, I would assess dolphins. 

78
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.153
[inaudible]

79
00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.480
in that little neighborhood. Tight happy Creek. Yeah.

80
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.700
Japan. It's a lot of weird food. Yeah. I feel like they just, you know,

81
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.390
they just go through like the little mermaid and just like, I'll have that.

82
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.210
These people, I don't, I don't think I've met anyone.

83
00:04:42.211 --> 00:04:45.300
Who's eaten dolphin before. I've never eaten dolphin,

84
00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:46.710
but I'm pretty sure they're being sold,

85
00:04:46.711 --> 00:04:50.220
which is why when that documentary came out, um, what was it called? Uh,

86
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.690
the code, the code Japan got loads of hate. Yeah.

87
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.690
Japanese people are like, Oh, we don't even know we don't dolphin. What?

88
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.370
And they're not surprised as well when it

89
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.190
[inaudible] fishing community. I've seen it being sold before, but I've never,

90
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.090
I've never known anyone. Who's actually eaten and enjoyed it to lump a

91
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.990
country together. Really. Unfortunately. I mean,

92
00:05:12.991 --> 00:05:15.210
Japan is quite huge and all the,

93
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.830
all the different prefectures do feel really different. Each other like special.

94
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.130
Oh, you go to every different prefecture and you're like,

95
00:05:23.131 --> 00:05:26.070
what's the specialty here? And I like living in Japan.

96
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.240
I kind of like understand the gift culture a bit more here because like every

97
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.890
way you travel to there's something unique for its wine. Yeah, exactly.

98
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:36.870
There's something unique about every place you go to.

99
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.940
And I didn't know if they've just like five headed,

100
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.990
like the tourists kind of gift. Pretty sure they have. Yeah.

101
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.090
It feels good to like,

102
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.230
come back from a place and actually have a souvenir that's unique in that

103
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.310
we've all been to like this kind of country or this place where you, like,

104
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.940
you feel like you have to get a souvenir just to get a,

105
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.800
and you get like the most tacky, little key chain or something like that.

106
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.470
Would you like a fridge magnet? Exactly. I do feel like the UK. I don't know.

107
00:06:05.471 --> 00:06:08.530
Did you have a do souvenirs? I didn't have a pool of souvenirs back,

108
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.270
but I feel obliged to hear

109
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.450
[inaudible] whales Wells, a little rock camp. So same thing in Brighton,

110
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.520
Brighton, Brighton, near beaches.

111
00:06:21.521 --> 00:06:25.450
They have chocolates that look like you want to with your teeth.

112
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.370
It's like just this sugar. Like it has the, like,

113
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.930
I guess the structure of rock, but it's just sugar and you just, just,

114
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.680
it just sounds like a lump of sugar, but British people don't have teeth.
