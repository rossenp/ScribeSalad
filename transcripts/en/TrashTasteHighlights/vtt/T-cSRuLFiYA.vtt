1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.200
<v 0>Well, so some reason, man, some action scenes, like neon,</v>

2
00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:07.480
impossible to figure out what the is going on in Monga. Like I'm, I'm,

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.810
I'm looking at these panels and the going on. And I'm like,

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.180
I would need to like, get my,

5
00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:15.990
my pen and draw along to like try and figure out what the actual cardiography

6
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.903
is.

7
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.350
<v 1>[Inaudible] I would have more time.</v>

8
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.960
<v 0>It's having like a battlefield view and you showing me like,</v>

9
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.860
like little statues move. Right.

10
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.690
<v 1>So fans trying to figure out King Crimson for the animator.</v>

11
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.010
That was literally me. I was like, what's going on.

12
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.090
<v 0>At manga? I'm like, I will sit there for a good,</v>

13
00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:38.600
like 30 seconds staring at this light. Yeah. I have no idea.

14
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.960
<v 1>That's the problem I have with like judge early on. Cause I was I'm reading it.</v>

15
00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:43.160
I'm like these stand pals,

16
00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:46.910
like getting so weird that I'm looking at something and I'm like,

17
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.290
I guess the stand is doing its power, but I don't know what the was you doing?

18
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.410
<v 0>Which is odd because then an action in Mongo, I started like,</v>

19
00:00:54.411 --> 00:00:57.320
not really care about cause half the time you can barely tell what's actually

20
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.690
happened. And you're just like putting the dots. I don't know.

21
00:00:59.691 --> 00:01:04.040
There's something about watching the fight unfold and like the way it was meant

22
00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:07.040
to in like a timed way with music and noise was so much more sad.

23
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.450
<v 1>I, I dunno.</v>

24
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.650
Cause I feel like that is the problem with a lot of anime fights period, right?

25
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.720
Is that they don't actually feel like fights. They feel like just,

26
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.730
they feel like impacts intermittently, uh, with,

27
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.680
with dialogue, with the twist, you know what I mean?

28
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.010
Cause like no one knows you see someone on my flights and you think no one

29
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.940
actually fights like this. You know what I mean? No one stories,

30
00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:35.330
a punch says a sentence, then throws a punch back. You know what I mean?

31
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.350
Not that that's not how fights work. Literally every Bucky fight. Exactly.

32
00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:42.260
Right. What's a fight without a dialogue. Come on gone.

33
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.420
Cause like that's why for example,

34
00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:48.200
the fights in God of high school really stood out to me because they actually

35
00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:51.230
felt like a Marshall last fight. You know what I mean?

36
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.810
Let's say what you want about the story or the whatever,

37
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.730
but the way the fights were directed and frames and just Cory choreographed,

38
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.790
they felt like actual fights. It felt like it felt like a Jackie Chan fight.

39
00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:04.340
Right? Exactly. And I'm cause that's what,

40
00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:07.010
that's what immediately stood out to me about that direction.

41
00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:08.510
And that animation was that, you know,

42
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:11.450
sometimes you get like the NAR narrative episode where you have like,

43
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.640
you have like the basic normal narrative fights.

44
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.910
And then you have like this one episode that is just like this,

45
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.140
the studio puts in all their budget and they're a team on one fight.

46
00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:23.960
And then that you, that, that is the fight that people remember.

47
00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:28.100
You know what I mean? But most anime flights are just there. I mean,

48
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.160
they are literally just animated Monga panels and you can't tell what's going on

49
00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:33.170
in a manga panel with action most of the time.

50
00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:36.270
So that's really what sets the good flights from the.

51
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.650
<v 0>Sometime I need that dialogue right. To help build it up. It's like a,</v>

52
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.100
it's like a good poem, right? Sometimes you need the story to make the word.

53
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.700
<v 1>Well, of course by, you know, I think there's like a limit to how much dialogue,</v>

54
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.771
like, you know,

55
00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:51.680
that's one thing I didn't like about like a lot of our tow fights is the fact

56
00:02:51.681 --> 00:02:55.370
that it's like, I don't need a flashback in the middle of a pie. I like,

57
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.380
I need that. I like it when.

58
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.800
<v 0>They're like internalizing their thoughts on the battle.</v>

59
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.760
That's more interesting to me than me. Like, ah, you're strong. And it's like,

60
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.090
well obviously that's why you're fight with each other. Not going to lie. My.

61
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.650
<v 1>Least favorite, like enemy fight trope is like the,</v>

62
00:03:10.651 --> 00:03:14.010
the guy in the sidelines explaining everything while it's happening.

63
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.200
To be fair that that's either hit or miss.

64
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.780
Cause the only like one yeah like, like it's,

65
00:03:20.781 --> 00:03:25.620
it's either Speedwagon or it's basically. It's like, it's like,

66
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.850
I dunno how this person yeah.

67
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.980
Is able to like explain every like physics movement as this guy's doing

68
00:03:31.981 --> 00:03:35.880
a one-inch punch. Right? It's like, it's like, what is the timeframe?

69
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.620
How was that happening? Then? There's like Bucky, which is just like, you,

70
00:03:39.621 --> 00:03:41.250
you have an e-sports commentator,

71
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:45.630
just like explaining every detail and technique and the bags.

72
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.740
I love that, man. I love it. That's the thing. Right? It's like,

73
00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:51.390
if it's like Joe, Joe, Bucky, where it's,

74
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.270
it's it's gone to the point where it's so unrealistic that it just becomes

75
00:03:54.271 --> 00:03:57.450
ridiculous. Exactly. I like that. I hate it when they,

76
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.990
Brian make it as if it's happening in real time. And it's like,

77
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.700
don't kid yourself guys. Like, isn't it.

78
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.960
Like you'd have to be like rap God in order to like commentate over it.

79
00:04:06.961 --> 00:04:09.330
That quickly as it's happening. Yes.

80
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.140
Sometimes you just hear a piece of dialogue in the time it takes us for like one

81
00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:16.740
punch to get thrown. A punch is just like a millisecond. Right.

82
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.010
And they have this five minute dialogue in the middle of their head in between

83
00:04:20.011 --> 00:04:23.580
this punch getting thrown multi page, like right.

84
00:04:23.581 --> 00:04:28.320
It's like where's the punch cards.

85
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.720
No, I'm just like, is time dilation?

86
00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:32.860
Just a thing when the anime characters get punished.

87
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.420
So something like Einstein's rolling in his grave right now. When, when,

88
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.340
whenever a punch gets thrown, man.

89
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.820
<v 0>The Monga is that where like someone gets stabbed and then like the light,</v>

90
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.070
but you fell in my trap and it's like, how many,

91
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.660
how many times have you practiced this?

92
00:04:48.661 --> 00:04:51.510
Where you just been like stabbed a punch? And this was like potty old plan.

93
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.630
Like, this is just like too, it happened so often.

94
00:04:54.631 --> 00:04:57.990
Or like sometimes they'll get like a fatal wound and they'll immediately like

95
00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.820
heal it. And it's like, what? Yeah. But then again.

96
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.070
<v 1>Right. It's like that,</v>

97
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.710
that kind of goes back into the whole thing of like how ridiculous it is as

98
00:05:04.711 --> 00:05:07.800
well. Right? Like Bucky does that. So often where it's like,

99
00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.260
you should be dead after one punch,

100
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.070
but you've somehow managed to survive like 10 punches of stab wound and like

101
00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:17.250
three gunshots. And you're still able to like form a dialogue. Well,

102
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.900
I feel like Baki is just like one side of the extreme where it's so extreme that

103
00:05:21.901 --> 00:05:23.880
you can't take it seriously anymore. But I mean,

104
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.810
I mean a lot of anime flights on that, I like anime trips, like animate.

105
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.570
It's just normalized getting punched and coughing up blood.

106
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.420
Whereas in real life you're internally hemorrhaging and

107
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.320
you're probably going to die. If you internally hemorrhage,

108
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.480
let's be honest if you cough of blood, bro,

109
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.360
not going to be good. If you smash your head through a concrete wall,

110
00:05:45.361 --> 00:05:49.440
which is apparently normal than anime, then you've got a concussion, you know,

111
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.360
or just a splattered head, no head. Exactly.

112
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.160
I want to realistic like toe stubbing seen.

113
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.470
<v 0>And that what I want. That's what I want to experience.</v>

114
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.710
I mean niche-y joke.

115
00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.520
<v 1>Yeah. Probably toast.</v>

116
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.190
Dubbing is like the closest I get to a real life animation. Right?

117
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.520
<v 0>I want someone to just animate someone's stubbing their toe.</v>

118
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.400
And that it's just like immediate, like a joke slightly like cough up blood.

119
00:06:15.401 --> 00:06:16.234
And they're like.

120
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.760
<v 1>Like Bubba, Bubba, Bubba, boy probably did some cause like in real life,</v>

121
00:06:21.761 --> 00:06:24.580
I don't know what it is about stubbing your toe. Like you stop your toe.

122
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.300
And it's one of the few injuries you get where you do it and you know,

123
00:06:28.301 --> 00:06:29.320
the pain is coming.

124
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.800
But for some reason there is a pain delay between you'd stubbing,

125
00:06:32.801 --> 00:06:34.600
your toe and the immense pain.

126
00:06:34.601 --> 00:06:37.900
You're about to feel like if there was a time for a real life,

127
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.040
anime flashback it's in that delayed pain delay, man.

128
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.240
<v 0>Now, if you were an animated character,</v>

129
00:06:43.241 --> 00:06:46.600
you would realize that you can synchronize your energy to counter the below

130
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.463
incoming.

131
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.600
<v 1>Come on. You can stop the nervous system from delivering it to your brain.</v>

132
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.000
Yeah. That's that's the closest you get to a enemy injury or whatever.
