1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.910
<v 0>Okay. Have we talked about a co-taught SUSE boss before? I don't remember.</v>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.460
I don't think we have, we have explained them to the audience.

3
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:08.400
So if they watch anime, you are chatting me. Right. You know what,

4
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.380
if you don't know what I could,

5
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:14.820
Tatsu is basically like a heated coffee table where it's like a,

6
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:18.900
it's like a little coffee table where that has blankets around it and you put

7
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.190
your legs in it and you put them under and it's all nice and cozy and warm.

8
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.800
And it is amazing.

9
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.760
<v 1>I don't know about amazing. I think it's amazing.</v>

10
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.140
There's a few logistical issues that crop up with us such as well.

11
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:34.790
How many legs can fit under that.

12
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.730
<v 0>Once a month? How big the table is now? Big. Depends on.</v>

13
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.450
<v 1>All of a sudden it's normally not that big it's normally you can comfortably</v>

14
00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:42.940
probably fit two people's legs.

15
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.630
<v 0>I mean, are you, are you, are you wearing this to Micah? Totsy which is tiny.</v>

16
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.150
<v 1>No, no, no. Like a normal potassium. Cause like I want to put,</v>

17
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.820
I want to stretch my legs fully out of that thing. Yeah.

18
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.220
You can only really fit like two before you start. Like, you know,

19
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.410
you start touching people's legs. I don't want to touch Jerry's legs.

20
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.403
Discuss all my homies.

21
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.690
<v 0>I don't want to play.</v>

22
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.190
<v 1>Footsie with Joey under the table.</v>

23
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.980
<v 0>Oh, I'm so stop. I want to twiddle toes. I call Luna.</v>

24
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.520
<v 1>What if you don't know them? Super. Are you pretty dude at the welfare?</v>

25
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.450
<v 0>If you, if you're sharing it to curtains,</v>

26
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.130
I'm not sharing your photos with the street.

27
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.230
<v 1>Yeah. Why not? That should be, that should be in a restaurant. It's nice.</v>

28
00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:24.770
But then also I find that it's like, I think you could turn it up and down,

29
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.370
but it's like, it's either like I would rather the room be hot,

30
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.520
then my legs be hot. Does that make sense? No.

31
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.140
<v 0>Oh, okay. I've I've I've I literally had this problem recently, which is like,</v>

32
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.520
why I, I re I, I get reminded why I really don't like winter. Right?

33
00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:44.180
So unlike the, unlike these boys, I hate the cold and I hate winter.

34
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.270
I love the cleanse. Like the reason I hate it is because you know,

35
00:01:47.271 --> 00:01:49.100
you're in a cold room and you want to get comfortable.

36
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.720
So what'd you do you put on the heater,

37
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.190
but I hate the feeling of a stuffy room or like the deck,

38
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.610
like this room is getting a bit from a stuffy country though.

39
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.190
Have you considered wearing another item.

40
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.023
<v 1>Of clothing?</v>

41
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.280
<v 0>Because there's a problem because if you wear like a jumper or something and the</v>

42
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.880
rooms code, then your hands are cold. And like, I'm just trying to work.

43
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.220
<v 1>Not that I can get.</v>

44
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.120
<v 0>That coat, the blood circulate to your fingers and off,</v>

45
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.440
or my feet. Like before we turned on the seats of my fever, ice cold,

46
00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:23.030
man, I am not joking

47
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.960
[inaudible] with your body. Like what the? I just, I,

48
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.710
my body was just not built for the cold and there's nothing more uncomfortable

49
00:02:33.711 --> 00:02:36.950
for me then just the opposite then just a stuffy room. Cause like,

50
00:02:36.951 --> 00:02:38.960
sometimes I'm like, maybe I'm getting ill.

51
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.910
And then I realized I go outside and it's because the room's so stuffy that I

52
00:02:43.911 --> 00:02:46.550
haven't realized how uncomfortable I'm feeling. That's why,

53
00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:50.420
that's why I very rarely turn on the heater unless it's like a seriously cold.

54
00:02:50.421 --> 00:02:52.640
Because for me it's like, if I'm cold,

55
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.360
I'll just wear another layer of clothing and then Hey, the room isn't stuffy.

56
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.590
<v 1>I'm old. But also it's really easy to make a room stuff.</v>

57
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.380
You just open a window for like one minute after you've heated the room up.

58
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.363
It won't be.

59
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.810
<v 0>Yeah. But then, but then after you opened the window, then it gets cold again.</v>

60
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.710
And then the cycle continues on in one in it. There, there is,

61
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:11.640
there is like never,

62
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.960
there is never like a perfect temperature that I'm like happy with when it's

63
00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:19.290
winter. Because if, if I need to like artificially warm it up,

64
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.620
then either it's going to be too stuffy or I'm going to be too cold.

65
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.520
There is no between.

66
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.260
<v 1>So nice about being in a warm room, knowing it's freezing out.</v>

67
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.880
<v 0>Magical about it. It's like going to bed in a thunderstorm, right? Like there's,</v>

68
00:03:32.881 --> 00:03:35.370
there's something comforting about it. Yeah. I dunno if you

69
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.840
[inaudible]

70
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.673
, I just gave you like a thousand yard stare. Like you were like, I know what you mean. Yeah.

71
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.120
<v 1>It's like the it's just like white noise outside.</v>

72
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.890
<v 0>It's there's something comforting about like outside is right now, but I'm safe.</v>

73
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.690
<v 1>Drywall. Some of the best sleeps I've had, I've been like camping on the floor,</v>

74
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.710
but because it's so freezing outside and you need a little like warm cocoon.

75
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.670
<v 0>Oh nice. Yeah. I agree. I agree. I agree. I just like,</v>

76
00:04:05.671 --> 00:04:08.850
I just like being comfortable existing, I guess.

77
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.070
Like I don't want to do anything to make my existence more comfortable.

78
00:04:14.071 --> 00:04:17.220
I just like being in a room and being like, okay, I can do whatever I want.

79
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.120
I think you just spoke on behalf of all humanity. I just want to,

80
00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.610
I just want a comfortable exams. I just want to be,

81
00:04:23.611 --> 00:04:27.780
he just wants to wear a turtle neck in his room and, and be a happy boy.

82
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.140
Honestly. What's wrong with that? I don't want to put on a heater. Okay.

83
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.240
To be honest, the only reason why I, okay.

84
00:04:33.241 --> 00:04:36.330
Two reasons why I don't wear turtlenecks. Hey, you're looking.

85
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.560
I looked like a Dick and B. I might leave Handjobs here though.

86
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.960
You can make a wound. I can't make it work.

87
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.960
I looked like I looked like a weirdo with a turtleneck,

88
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.410
but be like my neck for some reason. I don't know what it is.

89
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.150
It exerts so much heat. That's like legit.

90
00:04:54.151 --> 00:04:57.270
Like that's the reason why like I, like,

91
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.070
I can't wear a scarf either because when I wear a scarf, my Nick gets so.

92
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.990
<v 1>Swayed. I love wearing scarf.</v>

93
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.090
<v 0>I love, I love wearing scarves too,</v>

94
00:05:06.091 --> 00:05:10.170
but only if it's like really like I'm talking like minus 10 minus 20 degrees.

95
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.731
Literally the,

96
00:05:10.731 --> 00:05:14.160
the reason I thought I'd wait until the next had nothing to do with like me

97
00:05:14.161 --> 00:05:15.720
thinking toe. Next looks looks nice.

98
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.570
I just remember the first time I put on a turtleneck, I'm like, Oh,

99
00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:21.300
this is like permanently wearing a scarf that I'd never have to take off.

100
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.060
Perfect. For me. I love the feeling of waste.

101
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.730
It doesn't matter like how cold it is for me. I don't know why I get so sweaty.

102
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.830
<v 1>Who needs renewable energy. When we can just use Joey's phone.</v>

103
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.010
<v 0>All hovered around my neck, like this and just warm your hands up on my neck.</v>

104
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.110
Like, I don't know why. I don't know what it is.

105
00:05:40.111 --> 00:05:44.340
Like my neck is so hot and which sucks because people have always told me,

106
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.470
Oh yeah, you look really good in the scarf. And I'm like, yeah,

107
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.030
I'll look when wearing scuffs. Don't like the feeling of it,

108
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.120
but I can only wear for me. You say that you're fine,

109
00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:54.240
but you're not really fine. Exactly. It's like, it's like,

110
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.150
I like wearing a scarf and I think I look good in a scarf,

111
00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.600
but the point is I can't wear a scarf for more than two minutes.

112
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.140
Cause then I'm just.

113
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.520
<v 1>Like, this. It's so hot.</v>

114
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.360
<v 0>Overheating overload. I.</v>

115
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:07.603
<v 1>Kind of on of, but.</v>

116
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.170
<v 0>Yeah. Going back to why I like the tattoos is that co-taught SUSE is like,</v>

117
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.910
I can feel warmer cutout suit and not feel stuffy. So it's like one of,

118
00:06:15.911 --> 00:06:18.500
one of the few spaces where I'm just like, if I'm getting hot,

119
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.660
I can just roll on the Tatsu.

120
00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.470
But that's the problem I have with co-taught is this exact same problem I have

121
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:28.850
with beds in winter? It's that the moment I enter the cold tattoo,

122
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.960
the GS Jack up like 10 GS and I can't leave it. I felt.

123
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.120
<v 1>Also, I don't really like sitting on the floor, like sitting on the floor.</v>

124
00:06:37.121 --> 00:06:38.620
Isn't that comfortable for me. Right.

125
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.710
And cause that's what you normally have to sit on the floor. Cause some like,

126
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.450
I need some like back support man, but those chairs. Yeah.

127
00:06:46.451 --> 00:06:48.100
There's a pretty good bit like most of the time. Yeah.

128
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.230
<v 0>They've already have those two days. Just kind of like you just sit,</v>

129
00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:51.940
put your light and you just put your hands back.

130
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.490
If you want to lean back a little bit, let me, you can lean back on the couch.

131
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.900
I mean, if there's a couch that people don't have that. Right. But whatever.

132
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.690
I mean I'm being niche. Usually just bring your own folder.

133
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.220
<v 1>I'm like that guy with the camping chair, like flips it out with that hand.</v>

134
00:07:06.221 --> 00:07:09.850
I'm like, I'm ready for the coach. I'm ready to be comfortable. Yeah.

135
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.320
<v 0>Honestly like cutoff season. I remember,</v>

136
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.300
I remember the first time I tried out a guitar.

137
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.450
So you were here in Japan and it was like instant life-changing moment.

138
00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.290
<v 1>Wait, what do you mean? It's the warm table? What are you doing? Come on,</v>

139
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:21.910
come on.

140
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.950
<v 0>You have some of those moments where you just like,</v>

141
00:07:23.951 --> 00:07:27.370
how did I go my entire life without this? It is pretty wild.
