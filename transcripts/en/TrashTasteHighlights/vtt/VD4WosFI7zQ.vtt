1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.910
<v 0>Yeah, I guess, uh, going off of that, I want to ask, like, you know,</v>

2
00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:06.510
obviously you draw, God knows how many hours per day, right? Like,

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.870
I'm sure you've run into like, you know, injuries and like risk problems. Like,

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.850
is there like certain stuff that you do to like,

5
00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:13.110
make sure you don't hurt yourself?

6
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.710
<v 1>Where are you happy? They have to do some stretch.</v>

7
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.240
I have a message board or to my, for my hands to stretch like that or.

8
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.790
<v 0>Yeah, like those like risk odds that I see some animators wearing. No, not me.</v>

9
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.250
<v 1>Uh, but uh, yeah, if we, um, one, two hours, I have to do some stretch or</v>

10
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.070
sitting and you have also have a good seat. Good.

11
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.960
<v 0>Do you have a good gamer chair at home?</v>

12
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.780
<v 1>I remember Joe Brown. Betty. Yeah. But in fact, if I'm working on tablet so,</v>

13
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.510
and furniture, unfortunately I cannot be like that.

14
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.373
[inaudible].

15
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.740
<v 0>Don't forget the microphone by the way. Sorry. Um, I guess it's the same,</v>

16
00:00:57.741 --> 00:00:59.990
same kind of precautions. A lot of let's say like,

17
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.830
like professional gamers and e-sports athletes have to go through because you

18
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.350
doing a lot of movements on your wrist, carpal tunnel, right?

19
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.980
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. So sometimes I have been here, so,</v>

20
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.520
uh, so yeah, so, uh, uh, in fact animators have to do sport or so because yeah,

21
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.560
so I did something, I, um,

22
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.600
went to Gore gym with my friend Maggie and to do some exercise

23
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.100
because a yes, you lose, you lose muscles. Yeah. Yeah.

24
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.130
<v 0>I do feel doing YouTube as well. Cause I'm sat at my desk all day. I got,</v>

25
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.073
gotta do something.

26
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.180
<v 1>Which is a coroner. So now you, yeah, you don't, you don't leave much.</v>

27
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.010
You don't move much. Yes.

28
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.620
<v 0>To, to the desk, to the fridge. Right.</v>

29
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.730
[inaudible] like a teenager was sitting at your desk,

30
00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:50.780
playing video games all day and all night or whatever you never think about. Oh,

31
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.570
what are the ergonomics right now? You know? You never,

32
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.020
you never think about that part of my body, my injuries. Exactly.

33
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.360
I did feel bad. Cause when I, I used to play games,

34
00:01:59.361 --> 00:02:03.410
like she's gonna pretty much from after school till I went to bed and I never

35
00:02:03.411 --> 00:02:06.500
had any problems and my other friend would play like two hours a night.

36
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:10.400
If he was lucky and he got carpal tunnel. Oh Jesus. And I was like, you're weak,

37
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.920
real gamers. You ain't a pro gamer.

38
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.460
We're going to look at those weak wrists. Get out of here.

39
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.220
Those on gamer risks, get some real thumbs. I was just like, boy, I'm like,

40
00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:27.860
why am I risk not giving it this? Man's uh,

41
00:02:27.861 --> 00:02:32.150
giving it like Chad risks. Maybe I came up with a wound

42
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.270
[inaudible] natural selection, like shows you in the wrong way. You know,

43
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.170
my kid is going to have like jacked risks, like natural selection,

44
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.030
like, Oh my God.

45
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.820
<v 1>So most of when you are young, you can stay more longer just at your heart.</v>

46
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.740
But when you get older,

47
00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.640
you have no family kids and you can't afford to just stay out day, go back to,

48
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.673
to home. Yeah.

49
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.740
<v 0>No, no. One of your simplest controls so fast, they need to.</v>

50
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.760
<v 1>It was that. And he was trained to so right.</v>

51
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.090
And there was this pressure and these, uh,

52
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.330
those deadlines make them more, uh, faster and faster,

53
00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:21.000
but in good, you have the quality. Yeah.

54
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.080
But sometimes when you have a much experience,

55
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.830
you have to get faster in some time you have to sacrifice the quality. Yeah.

56
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.570
And I.

57
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.810
<v 0>And I suppose, are those, the scenes that kind of always get MeMed on,</v>

58
00:03:33.811 --> 00:03:35.880
on Twitter and social media and stuff. Yeah.

59
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.590
<v 1>And there's also, you have just seen, Oh wow.</v>

60
00:03:40.591 --> 00:03:45.210
A day was, uh, a bit a mess. Uh, some because of the communication,

61
00:03:45.211 --> 00:03:48.010
wasn't good. Or with the production, uh,

62
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.040
the animator didn't have time to do it or it was Jenny

63
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.180
Metta. Couldn't do it. Okay. We've have nobody. Okay. We'll give it to China,

64
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.020
Korea to deviate and, and China CRA, Oh, we don't have time.

65
00:04:01.021 --> 00:04:04.110
We have to speed it, right? Yes.

66
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.170
Seven deadly sins depends also,

67
00:04:07.171 --> 00:04:11.490
which is will to eat because sometimes you have a gloss name.

68
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.820
So for example, you have stirred, you have a, we do

69
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.790
[inaudible] bet. Oh, we don't have much time. We have to do, uh, we have,

70
00:04:20.791 --> 00:04:25.530
we do just a 10 episode and the two will be done by defense to do so.

71
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.340
We asked to study a, B and C to do, uh, each one episode.

72
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.410
And if a BNC don't have the good stuff, it looks bad.

73
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.230
You have some accident. And also more than the studio,

74
00:04:39.231 --> 00:04:44.190
you should more look at this tough to start that the studio is like a share

75
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.540
and just give them a good,

76
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.070
a good environment to,

77
00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:54.150
for a good working place for the animators and a good assistant productions,

78
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.730
but, or the skills and all the,

79
00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.500
the staff will be art or in freelance. So it's a study of who,

80
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.023
uh, okay.

81
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.320
If you can do this project and we can give you a good working walking.

82
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.873
Yeah.

83
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.910
<v 0>Always wondered. Cause you know, there's,</v>

84
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.160
there's always like the meme in our community where if,

85
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.150
if an episode is animated well, versus an episode that's animated bad.

86
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.730
We always talk about like, Oh, it's the budget. You know, they're not,

87
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:25.560
they're not given enough budget, but like how, like how, how true is that?

88
00:05:25.561 --> 00:05:28.920
How is that actually reflected or like, is it, do they have,

89
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.850
is it all about the staff that they can hire? And the staff, that's all.

90
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.230
<v 1>It's tough. A lot of things. In fact, you have also the budget,</v>

91
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.100
but for example, you have an MPS that you have a lot of action,

92
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.330
lots of movements. Uh, actually one episode is two,

93
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.910
350 cuts. But for some,

94
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.850
a lot of heavy episode, a lot of action,

95
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.930
Epic episode can have a 500 cuts. Right?

96
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.100
So for this episode it will be or expensive,

97
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:02.810
more expensive pocket cut. But so for the next episode,

98
00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.060
you have to adjust to this, right.

99
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.450
<v 2>So if.</v>

100
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.700
<v 1>You had to claim X on X episode seven,</v>

101
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.330
so maybe episode eight will be more cool. Right.

102
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.280
<v 0>And you talked about some animators being more experienced and more skilled and</v>

103
00:06:18.281 --> 00:06:22.000
like have, have making a name for themselves. Can they, um,

104
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.850
can they negotiate a higher price per cuts? Yeah.

105
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.610
<v 1>Yeah. Uh, actuary. So, uh,</v>

106
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.050
so their rate of the Duquette is, uh, when you,

107
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.710
when you have the offer and so you said you, the rate of the cut is this.

108
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.300
So most of the series is a 4,500 yen.

109
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.010
So I don't know, $5, roughly five pounds for one cup, one cut,

110
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.350
one cut can take you like a one hour, one day,

111
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:51.213
two days.

112
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.970
<v 2>Oh gosh. $5 for two days.</v>

113
00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.350
<v 1>Someday. Amy, it can take you a one weekend. Okay.</v>

114
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.870
<v 0>I know a great website called Fiverr.</v>

115
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.850
<v 1>Um, so like that's a huge meal you can ask, excuse me. Um, you, you, you, you.</v>

116
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.903
<v 2>[Inaudible] smile.</v>

117
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.650
<v 1>You have to negotiate for this guy. Is it a heavy cat?</v>

118
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.510
Can you put it twice,

119
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.600
twice a price or three times the price, please. You have to negotiate.

120
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.510
And sometimes if you are very, very famous, like, uh,

121
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:36.340
we call this a super animator, like a one man army,

122
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.850
right? You say, my rate is this okay.

123
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.790
<v 2>They want to, they want to, because you just go.</v>

124
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.870
<v 1>Well, if you have very famous mate,</v>

125
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:51.070
I Coreen like a veteran and sure they have the name value or because

126
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:54.100
in the show, people want to look it. Right.

127
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.220
<v 0>So that's kind of how like a voice was like, YouTube is too right.</v>

128
00:07:57.221 --> 00:07:58.054
It's just like,

129
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.840
if you're a famous YouTuber that has so much years of experience,

130
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.240
then you can just be like, yeah. You know, honestly,

131
00:08:04.241 --> 00:08:06.640
if you've made a name for yourself, you deserve a higher.

132
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:11.840
<v 1>We can set that. It's a bit like a soccer teams, uh, when you're, Oh,</v>

133
00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:14.740
I want to want to run. Ardo messy.

134
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.850
<v 0>Right? Yeah. Is that why, whenever you see like the climax of a big scene,</v>

135
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.290
especially in like some shown anatomy or like some big,

136
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.570
you always see the same names animating.

137
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:29.800
<v 1>Oh, same name as a yes. All the line or some new ones,</v>

138
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:34.550
because some, you cannot relate or only have some few names.

139
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.090
So you have to find new talent, right? Yeah.
