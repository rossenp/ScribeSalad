WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.870
<v 0>I hope you would sucky. Yeah. And you gave it a seven.</v>

2
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.300
<v 1>[Inaudible] to you. That's the one with, uh, things on as he, yeah. That's the,</v>

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.273
yeah.

4
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.280
<v 0>The, the module one. That's the body pillow we have outside. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.850
I've watched that. You've you've, you've actually watched [inaudible].

6
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.570
<v 1>[Inaudible] and I, I, at the end, I was like, I'm going to understand Ms. Young.</v>

7
00:00:20.571 --> 00:00:21.404
And at the end, I was like,

8
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.370
I don't understand what I'm like with this golden wind and going on and stuff

9
00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:27.710
like that. And I'm like, I dunno. So again,

10
00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:29.150
it just doesn't seem like a show you would watch.

11
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.100
I watched all of persona for the animation.

12
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.940
<v 0>I noticed that I noticed that as well, never played persona for persona.</v>

13
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.050
<v 1>Do that. I did not, I I'll be a hundred pounds with you at the time.</v>

14
00:00:39.051 --> 00:00:40.430
I legitimately didn't know it was a game.

15
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.540
<v 0>That's like, that's like, wait, did you watch Dungan romper as well? Yeah,</v>

16
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:49.460
he did. He played Duncan. Give it a four. I happily, but that's fine.

17
00:00:49.461 --> 00:00:50.240
That's fine.

18
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.720
<v 1>Um, for the shows that I haven't rated, you can ask me and ask me what I'd.</v>

19
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.940
<v 0>Give it. Like, what would you give a no game, no wife, or that.</v>

20
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.900
<v 1>If I was, if I was.</v>

21
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.990
<v 0>Yeah, a hard 10 now, like a seven on a seven.</v>

22
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.710
Okay. It's about that. What'd you give Excel world.

23
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.360
<v 1>Uh, you know, like a, like a four,</v>

24
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.050
what would you give another look at one

25
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.800
another was. Be got to HK as well, you know? Okay. Actually I did. I love,

26
00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:23.930
we got a hit, like a Gracie.

27
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.840
I can tell you exactly why I watched another as well,

28
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.750
because I was talking to a girl at the time and she was like,

29
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.620
of course my favorite show is another it's the best show. And I was like,

30
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.810
all right, fine. I'll watch this show.

31
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.640
Cause I'm trying to like SIM I'm trying to.

32
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.070
<v 0>So I'll try another was kind of like the,</v>

33
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.810
kind of like the true crimes documentary.

34
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.551
<v 1>You know what I mean?</v>

35
00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:47.450
Everyone knows white girls love true crime and before they get into true crime,

36
00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:51.020
you know, they're a little younger than like another erased. Yes. You know,

37
00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:52.090
all these shows that I love.

38
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.390
<v 0>This is like, yes, I too,</v>

39
00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:56.060
like final destination and watching trashy horror movies.

40
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.680
I can do that all day long.

41
00:01:57.681 --> 00:02:01.790
That's literally what Sydney gets me to do whenever I like I'll give you,

42
00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:05.570
I'll give you props though that you a watched claim all and gave it a night.

43
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.710
<v 1>Honestly. I love claiming. It's awesome, man. I,</v>

44
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.290
that is one of the enemies that got done most.

45
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.130
<v 0>Yeah. That's why I'm surprised you gave it a nine because Claymore, Monga,</v>

46
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.180
Monga nine or 10 clay, clay Maga, masterpiece, anime.

47
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.120
<v 1>Feel things that I hadn't felt before. I was like,</v>

48
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.110
like a level of uncomfortableness that I haven't experienced before. Like,

49
00:02:30.111 --> 00:02:33.020
I don't know why there's something so unnerving and uncomfortable about

50
00:02:33.021 --> 00:02:33.800
watching.

51
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.900
<v 0>Yeah. I felt that when I worked at Bazaar.</v>

52
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.300
<v 1>I would like it like you up a little bit. And then I can tell, like, I honestly,</v>

53
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:43.970
I wish I I'm, I'm going to try my best to try and read the Maga.

54
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.350
But I said I was going to read something. Yeah.

55
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.050
<v 0>Recently where bought all the Monga. Just cause I want to read it again. Cause.</v>

56
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.630
<v 1>What was the other show? I said I was going to read the mangrove.</v>

57
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.350
<v 0>Oh wait, I have no fight. Oh, you finished April 21, right?</v>

58
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.500
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. I did. I want to do that. Well, uh, I actually, I downloaded, uh,</v>

59
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.140
Lex first. No, no, no, no. I was going to read that,

60
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:05.020
but I actually downloaded the first 30 chapters of one piece thing like that.

61
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.780
<v 0>Oh, he's getting [inaudible] but I haven't, I haven't stopped.</v>

62
00:03:09.781 --> 00:03:11.520
I haven't had pocket marketing.

63
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.910
[inaudible].

64
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.030
<v 1>I'll tell you when I start, like I'll get,</v>

65
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.600
but I haven't marketing your calendar.

66
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.020
<v 0>And come back to us in 10 years time. We'll see where he is.</v>

67
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.350
Honestly like Claymore is a amazing Mongo. One of the best Mongols out there

68
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.770
[inaudible].

69
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.350
<v 1>Finished. Like totally. Okay, good, good. Yeah.</v>

70
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.170
<v 0>22, 23 volumes. Um,</v>

71
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.720
cause like the play more anime had a anime original ending if I remember. Yeah.

72
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.980
And it was complete from what I remember. Yeah.

73
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.150
<v 1>I remember having a good time. I remember I watched a dub. The voice actor was,</v>

74
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.420
uh, Greg was like playing the whiny characters he always does.

75
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.980
And I think he was a little too windy for like, I mean, that's just Greg Harris.

76
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.100
He's too good at his job.

77
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.870
<v 0>No, no, because like, I, I remember that, that was like,</v>

78
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.480
I swear he was typecast in that role for like the longest.

79
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.630
<v 1>How many of those characters and no one else could do a voice like him.</v>

80
00:04:03.631 --> 00:04:07.410
It's like sounding whining. It was always him during the whiny character.

81
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:08.783
I'm going to say.

82
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.780
<v 0>Seven out of 10. Honestly, I went no one.</v>

83
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.310
<v 1>That everyone was talking about the show like Jesus had came down himself and</v>

84
00:04:17.311 --> 00:04:20.910
brought a show and I watched it and I thought, honestly, this is kind of.

85
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.030
Like it's, it's good. But like it's kinda boring. Like,

86
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.880
is that how you feel about it? Obviously now I would give it a six.

87
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.700
<v 0>Is that how you feel about Aurora proxy as well? You gave that a seven as well.</v>

88
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.550
<v 1>Oh, go proxy. I remember. I was just like, what the?</v>

89
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.000
<v 0>It's happening again? This doesn't seem like an anime that you would watch. No.</v>

90
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.120
Like the ergo box is the last animal on it.

91
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.470
<v 1>Watching. Like you don't when you go to a modern art museum and you look at the,</v>

92
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.420
you're like, yeah, I get it.

93
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.870
<v 0>That's what I felt. That's what I felt like</v>

94
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.480
you've watched or proxy is like the same amount of like what the I would get if

95
00:04:54.481 --> 00:04:57.780
you came up to me tomorrow and said, so I watched a serial experiments lane.

96
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.950
<v 1>I've been wanting to watch that for a while. I just, I just haven't had the,</v>

97
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.990
the opportunity to be like, yeah, I want to waste a day. Yeah. Not.

98
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.980
<v 0>Not really enjoyable. Have a, an avid brain that.</v>

99
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.570
<v 1>I feel like you watch,</v>

100
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.660
you watch shows like that to come out with like just your brain being like wet.

101
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.480
But like that's not fun half the time. So I don't remember.

102
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:19.170
<v 0>I mean, it is fun depending on your mood, because I remember like, I,</v>

103
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.450
I took me ages to watch serial experiments lane.

104
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.020
And then I was just in this weird mood where I'm just like, yeah, I,

105
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.380
I want my mind to be up. That, that sounds like exactly right now.

106
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.220
And then I did have a challenge. Yeah. It's like, it's like me with,

107
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.570
you asked me putting, put in like a wait,

108
00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:36.150
I'm waiting to wake up for the day where I'm just like, yeah, I want,

109
00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:37.290
I want depression right now.

110
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.400
<v 1>Why the did I give, uh, this anime?</v>

111
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.730
<v 0>Yeah. I've noticed that. Why would you,</v>

112
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.620
I was about to say you gave that a nine and I'm like,

113
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.200
wasn't the milk TVs. Is that what it is?

114
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.320
That's all I remember from that, that.

115
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.740
<v 1>They get to the little two bonus points. But again,</v>

116
00:05:57.741 --> 00:06:01.430
that was in the same weekend that I watched the other show on the country will

117
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:02.264
48 hours.

118
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.280
<v 0>Cause I remember mama, you HSA was like studio arms. And if you didn't know,</v>

119
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.070
if you don't do the arms, they were like on their studio.

120
00:06:08.071 --> 00:06:12.430
They were like famous for being a studio, like transitioned into animal.

121
00:06:12.431 --> 00:06:16.240
That's probably why I've connected a little. And um, yeah, I mean,

122
00:06:16.241 --> 00:06:19.420
that was like one of the first shows they produced.

123
00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:22.480
That was an anime that was seen as just not complete trash,

124
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.310
but I wouldn't call it a nightmare.

125
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.710
<v 1>Well sexual things going on or something like that. Some vibes of little set.</v>

126
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.390
[inaudible].

127
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.860
<v 0>I mean, I I'd say as an impressionable teenager,</v>

128
00:06:32.861 --> 00:06:36.040
I can see why you are connected with that on a personal level.

129
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.820
Yeah. I think that's pretty much everything. Cause uh,

130
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.380
you haven't rated a lot of them.

131
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.230
<v 1>I would bump kill the kill up one for getting me in the hand tie.</v>

132
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.333
That same thing I would.

133
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.310
<v 0>To really killer killer killer is what made me be like, you know what?</v>

134
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.530
I don't make girls a hot I'm like, you don't want.

135
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.800
<v 1>I have this. And there was, and that's how I was like, Oh.</v>

136
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.970
<v 0>This is good. That's what you need to get into the gym shoes, man. Come on.</v>

137
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.320
We know we're going to get him into that event. You can run away eventually.

138
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.510
Wait, wait. Okay. Then if you'd like to them, all you shot,

139
00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:08.380
did you like long horizon?

140
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.380
<v 1>I loved LA [inaudible] is one of my favorite shows. That makes sense.</v>

141
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.260
It's written by the same people. I'm actually hype.

142
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.690
Even though I think I need to rewatch a little bit longer, long and season two.

143
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.600
I remember I loved the world. Yeah. Like in lockers. Yeah.

144
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.950
<v 0>Boulder's, one of my money is a amazing, like, I don't know how.</v>

145
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.550
<v 1>They like write stories. I'm glad as well, stuff like that.</v>

146
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.120
I'm also glad that the show didn't like blow its load,

147
00:07:31.121 --> 00:07:34.210
like immediately and stop telling us everything about it. Like, yeah. I love it.

148
00:07:34.211 --> 00:07:34.961
When the show is tease,

149
00:07:34.961 --> 00:07:37.600
that's what the world like here's a little crumb crumbling knowledge.

150
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.910
And then you just don't mention it for a few episodes. You like, Oh. Yeah.

151
00:07:39.911 --> 00:07:41.380
We already know we were in a video.

152
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.410
<v 0>I forget because I remember log horizon.</v>

153
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.960
I remember watching the first two or three episodes of it.

154
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.570
Dropped it immediately because I'm just like really? What,

155
00:07:49.571 --> 00:07:52.720
what is this beat a sword art online, man, what the is this?

156
00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.830
Because like the worst thing about locker horizon was that one,

157
00:07:56.831 --> 00:08:00.010
like the animation is like, is like, great.

158
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.460
It's like the most typical five-hour 10 animation.

159
00:08:03.461 --> 00:08:05.050
This is just a away seasonal show.

160
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:10.090
And the first three or so episodes will like the most generic kind of

161
00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:11.710
introduction you can get to a world.

162
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.040
And it didn't start getting interesting until they probably started explaining

163
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:19.750
like the game mechanics and seeing, seeing the game mechanics being broken,

164
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.860
like within this world was just so interesting.

165
00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:27.100
<v 1>And that whole arc where like there was a guy who would kill him, the villages.</v>

166
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.193
Yeah. Yeah.

167
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.570
<v 0>What really you, you sold me immediately was like when they,</v>

168
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.930
when they first discovered that they can make things taste good.

169
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.140
And then they like invented the burger. I was like, yo,

170
00:08:38.141 --> 00:08:40.960
this is really interesting. This, this isn't even an ISA guy.

171
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.840
This is just like a, like an entrepreneur business.

172
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.820
[inaudible] was that's what? It was basically just like a business textbook.

173
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.110
<v 1>Do you guys remember what happens in these like seven out of 10 shares bro?</v>

174
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.010
The moment something isn't like exceptional. I'm like that's going in the.

175
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.270
<v 0>Fellows look arrives is not a</v>

176
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:02.040
[inaudible] whatever the.

177
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.350
<v 1>It's called that went straight into it. Let's forget everything.</v>

178
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:06.240
<v 0>[Inaudible] was cool because again,</v>

179
00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:08.040
it was like against done by telling them my money.

180
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:12.510
Who's like somehow can like make you learn while reading these stories.

181
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.330
I don't know how he does it. I think I have a slight spice and Wolf. Right?

182
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.240
It's like spice and Wolf. Exactly. Like the reason why I love spice was because,

183
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:22.570
because like I actually learned like a proper like useful business skills for

184
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.250
read a minute. I'm just getting horny over this. If this Wolf wife,

185
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.690
I'm marketing genius, things about economics,

186
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.440
that's not law and that's not legal. That's not allowed. What are you,

187
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:38.340
what are you doing? I can't be horny and smart at the same time. How that works.

188
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.880
<v 1>I feel like I have like amazing brain compression. Like I, my, my, my brain.</v>

189
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.190
<v 0>Zips, like, you.</v>

190
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.070
<v 1>Know how, like when you compress a file to like load the memory, it takes up.</v>

191
00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.830
That's what I do with animate immediately when I'm done. I'm like zip that up.

192
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.890
Put it in storage, forget about that thing. And then when we watched it,

193
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.310
it's like unzipping the farm, like, Oh yeah, this did happen. Has this man,

194
00:09:58.311 --> 00:10:02.060
like min-max these brine? I don't actually think I've I've, you know,

195
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:04.400
I've sorted the storage on my brain appropriately.

196
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:09.290
You've got a sorting algorithm. Literally just veranda me my goal.
