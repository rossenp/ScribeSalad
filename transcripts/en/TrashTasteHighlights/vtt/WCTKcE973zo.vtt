1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>And we can, we just all agree. That's back in 2020,</v>

2
00:00:02.491 --> 00:00:03.930
which is still when we're filming this,

3
00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:07.470
by the way that my little POG champ was the worst meeting.

4
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.090
Can we just, can we just agree? I don't know what meme of the year was,

5
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.050
but that was, it was definitely not that it was definitely not that meme.

6
00:00:15.051 --> 00:00:15.884
I should say that.

7
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.510
I don't know that meme kind of came out of nowhere and two,

8
00:00:20.511 --> 00:00:22.370
it died so fast.

9
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.800
And I'm so glad that it was animated so that the poor person who voiced it

10
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.100
didn't get a full literary steroid, as you imagined,

11
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.850
that was like a person on Tik TOK. It'd be like, Oh my God, am I guaranteed?

12
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:39.020
There's like a number of like girls who went on to take talk.

13
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.860
It did like the whole voice. Of course. I'm not gonna look. Have you had,

14
00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.610
have you had like take talks of people voicing over your videos? Yeah, yeah.

15
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.850
Yeah. So she went and did a lot of like anime character stuff. Oh yeah, yeah.

16
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.610
Loads. And they fully dress up in costume.

17
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.710
I've heard people doing that of just like me talking like normally,

18
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.460
like they would take a segment of me from like an, so you just get a fandom.

19
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.440
Yeah. That's just a fandom extra step.

20
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.030
Which where it's like someone took like really old audio of me and like an

21
00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:08.060
answer me, same part where I'm just answering a question normally.

22
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.350
And then just like voicing over and acting over. I was like, I mean, come on.

23
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.990
There's lots of other like audio clips you could have taken.

24
00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:17.720
That's a little more interesting. Right, right. Do you have a,

25
00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:21.560
do you have any people like, uh, impersonating your voice? I get that a lot.

26
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.810
I mean, yeah, but that's cause you have a distinct voice,

27
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.650
I guess I don't exactly have a distinct voice. There's a few videos out there.

28
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.270
If people like, like, I think I mentioned this before the podcast, right?

29
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.250
They like go around on discord. [inaudible] the reaction.

30
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.300
I don't have crazy fans like you and what they do.

31
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.850
They just do like the most broken English accent.

32
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.980
[inaudible] hello, governor like a terrible, a British accent.

33
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.720
Doesn't sound always a deep voice.

34
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.630
Just doesn't even sound remotely like a British accent.

35
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.820
[inaudible] so your dog via video, this is [inaudible]

36
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.030
there's there's like they'll they'll like do yeah, exactly.

37
00:02:14.031 --> 00:02:15.770
So they'll people in post next, Sebastian,

38
00:02:15.771 --> 00:02:19.070
but not the actual Sebastian that I'm posting it. Like my Sebastian,

39
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.100
Sebastian there'll be like in the American accent.

40
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.320
I how to fight I do this because I'm so ingrained to do some British.

41
00:02:24.321 --> 00:02:24.891
It'd be like, cause you know,

42
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:27.800
like Sebastian's catch phrase is simply one hell of a Butler, right.

43
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.690
There'd be like, I'm simply one hell of a Butler. And it was like, awful.

44
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.990
She was sound like, like half English, half American attempt. And it's like,

45
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:39.980
what? And um, that was a diff that was like layered. Like, yeah.

46
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.820
I was like, how do I break a British person,

47
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.910
person eating an American person, impersonating a British person.

48
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.920
Like I would hear these, I'd hear these voices that they would do. And I'm like,

49
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.440
there's no way they're going to believe that. And then the moment they do it,

50
00:02:57.441 --> 00:03:01.840
they're like, Oh God. And I'm like, what? This is me.

51
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.740
And then there was someone who, well, he went on like voice acting websites,

52
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.860
trying to be me called it's Connor or something. It's Connor.

53
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.590
And they would go around making references to my videos.

54
00:03:10.591 --> 00:03:13.920
Like I referenced myself. Like I go around and be like, Oh yes.

55
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.930
Remember that time I was Sebastian, good times. Like, references themselves.

56
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.170
That's that's some like, tell me why. You know what I mean?

57
00:03:22.171 --> 00:03:26.370
Like who actually does, like, it's the only thing you had. Right? It's like,

58
00:03:26.371 --> 00:03:28.620
I've made it now. I'm done making new stuff.

59
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.320
I'm just going to reference myself until I'm in time.

60
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.790
I like what people like shoot, see dog. Yeah. He said the thing.

61
00:03:35.791 --> 00:03:38.970
So it must be him. It infuriates me to death because I'm like,

62
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.390
if this is all it takes to get you to believe this is me.

63
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.790
I hope your credit card gets stolen. Just serve it.

64
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.840
Like you had a comment if you think that's bad. Yeah, no, no. Seriously.

65
00:03:48.841 --> 00:03:52.500
Like I haven't had people posting any of my voice, but I've had people like,

66
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.330
you know, kind of trying to do it by just speaking in a Australian accent.

67
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.270
Yeah. And sometimes the voice is totally not me.

68
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.680
It's a completely different voice.

69
00:04:01.681 --> 00:04:05.910
But because they're speaking in like a semi light oil Australia,

70
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.770
it's pretty fun. How light, how much room people would be. Yeah.

71
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.440
I've not seen any tech talks,

72
00:04:13.441 --> 00:04:18.060
but I've had exactly the same like comments of like some random YouTube who like

73
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.720
is reviewing anime clips or something in a slight British accent.

74
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.250
And they're like, Oh my God, it's gig. I'm not just that.

75
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.440
The thing that annoys me no more actually is not on YouTube or ticked off.

76
00:04:28.441 --> 00:04:32.790
But it's on Twitter where anyone apparently anyone Southeast Asian who posts

77
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.780
like a selfie now who's also into anime. It's just like, Oh my God,

78
00:04:36.781 --> 00:04:41.310
you look like, Gignac you do? Oh my God. I have so many photos of people.

79
00:04:41.311 --> 00:04:45.240
Like just like random Indian celebrities. And people are just like,

80
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.320
yo Joey, like I have a go.

81
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.010
My sister even sent me one. It was like, she found like on TV,

82
00:04:53.011 --> 00:04:57.690
there was this like a Bollywood like movie or I guess like would show that they

83
00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.310
were like promoting on an ad or something.

84
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.370
And apparently like one of the dudes just straight up,

85
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.770
like apparently looked like me. And I'm like,

86
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.920
it's just the Brown man with like a BA like that doesn't make

87
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.220
apparently every Brown man with a is me. Yeah. I get that with white dudes.

88
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.500
Like every white dude with a, I don't take talk. It's like,

89
00:05:16.501 --> 00:05:21.180
for some reason they say, I looked like Cedar. I'm like, what the is there?

90
00:05:21.181 --> 00:05:25.170
Like, is there like any that kind of like, uh, like,

91
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.020
Oh that you look like so-and-so person has been kind of flattering. Uh,

92
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.940
I've only had one example of that. And that's when people said that,

93
00:05:32.941 --> 00:05:35.850
I looked like, uh, what was it? A crackdown, Jason mama.

94
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.850
And like, Oh, you look like Jason Mamoa if he didn't work out.

95
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.570
And I was like, yeah, y'all take that. Jason Mamoa was good luck.

96
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.790
It's kind of like Benedict Cumberbatch ones, but right, right.

97
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.760
I used to have like really big, like a curly hat that looked similar to him,

98
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.960
joked that I was like him and uncle. Cause I was also like British. Yeah.

99
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.550
Parents are British to Joe.

100
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.970
[inaudible] he's a British man. Therefore he looks like better than it.

101
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.200
I was like, no, I don't. I don't look like that. there now. He's nice. He's fun.

102
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.190
We like it. We like it. We have fun. Yeah. One got I I, I dunno.

103
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.080
It's two distinct cause like no,

104
00:06:19.081 --> 00:06:21.460
nobody really knows anything about Southeast Asia.

105
00:06:21.461 --> 00:06:24.610
So now it's just like F it's like w with like the new,

106
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.340
just like Japanese or Chinese people right now.

107
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.610
Cause now they're like Chinese and like Japanese culture has been more like,

108
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.620
and Koreans have been like more globalized, like Southeast Asians.

109
00:06:35.621 --> 00:06:38.150
I just sit here in our own corner being like, Oh, you know,

110
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.990
there's more than like one country here as well, guys. You know,

111
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.100
it it's gone from like,

112
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.010
I can't tell the difference between Japanese Koreans and Chinese.

113
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.380
I can't tell the difference between Thai Phillip.

114
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.720
[inaudible] I can feel called out

115
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.020
like half the memes on like our subreddit.

116
00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.690
It's just like a different white person with a bed. And it's just like,

117
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.680
Oh my goodness, hold on. It's a monkey brain.

118
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.920
I got no beard now actually. Well, I mean, I just shaved it like two days ago.

119
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:13.570
Oh the amount of memes though, of like you with baby face is hilarious. Yeah.

120
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.230
I do look like a ten-year-old without a beard, someone posted on the subreddit,

121
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:22.090
this like old photo of me in a suit. Have you guys seen? I was like, what?

122
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.670
Why, how did they find that it's on Google. It's on my Instagram. I thought,

123
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.460
yeah. Like the second ever photo was like six years old or something.

124
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:35.110
There's a baby. I know. I was like, how old was I? Like 20?

125
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.490
Maybe you just looked at the kind of kid who was like, get me out of here. Yeah,

126
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.410
I did. Yeah. I, I regret it. Not a good funnel.
