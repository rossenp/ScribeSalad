1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.930
<v 0>I don't know. It just feels,</v>

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.610
I feel bad for the people who physically like can't control the gambling.

3
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.040
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I, I do, but they should not be playing games like this.</v>

4
00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:10.874
And I feel like,

5
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.910
I feel like these games should really come with a warning to take time.

6
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:16.880
Exactly. It should come.

7
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.200
<v 0>They should be like heavy warnings of games, I think to like, say, Hey, listen,</v>

8
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.800
you can spend a grand and come out with PNGs. Like, what was that?

9
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.580
What are you looking at? Sorry. Okay. Sorry.

10
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.170
Let's you'll be like a heavy warning saying, listen,

11
00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:32.960
you can progress vendor grant for like an animation,

12
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.360
the P and G that gets you a little bit of serotonin. Like,

13
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:39.020
that's it like no money involved, like gambling totally fair. That it's like,

14
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.370
well, I just, it angers me so much. How, like.

15
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.200
<v 1>I don't see the value in those. I mean, that's, that's,</v>

16
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.590
that's just the new generation. Right? What would you want to pay for it?

17
00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:50.360
You want to pay for more money now I'll pay for a little bit.

18
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.010
<v 0>I don't like often I never had people like defending gambling gods. Right?</v>

19
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.320
They're just like, yeah, dude. It's it's what it is. Gambling is what it is.

20
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.500
You go in there and it's and yeah, if you want to go and waste your money,

21
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.620
don't waste. You want it. But in Gacha everyone's like, Oh no,

22
00:01:03.621 --> 00:01:05.450
actually like it's, everyone's like, I guess,

23
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.550
cause the option there is free to play, but.

24
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.590
<v 1>Because there's no free to peak play gambling.</v>

25
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.730
[inaudible].

26
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.370
<v 0>Ashley, some good customer casinos will give you free drinks. You just turn up,</v>

27
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.730
get a free drink. Let's go. I guess that's the equivalent of free to play.

28
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.670
Right? I'll have an orange juice please. No gambling.

29
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.710
That's the equivalent of like free tentpole today. Yeah. And they are generous,

30
00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:30.710
but I guess people, if you don't have a gambling addiction,

31
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.980
you can't understand how it feels to have a gambling addiction. And I get it.

32
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:36.500
Why some people might just want to play a game.

33
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.650
Don't know that it has like gambling in it maybe, essentially.

34
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.900
And then they get like kind of tricked into it.

35
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.100
Cause they've been weaned on the game.

36
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.030
<v 1>And then that's, that's just modern apps in my opinion, because,</v>

37
00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:51.740
because we've just found a way to literally hack our brains, like human beings.

38
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.360
Like we, we, we like to think that we're not predictable. Right. But how,

39
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.790
how have like five, 10 years ago? Can you imagine like,

40
00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:03.170
just like having most of your life have most of my life now is scrolling down on

41
00:02:03.171 --> 00:02:06.380
something. You know what I mean? Most of my life, when I'm talking to you guys,

42
00:02:06.381 --> 00:02:08.630
I'm scrolling down on some kind of time.

43
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.960
<v 0>Yeah. I guess we'll get into some philosophical stuff here.</v>

44
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.390
But back to the point of catch-up right?

45
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.050
The other thing that we've done is that we've done the best thing that we could

46
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.630
ever want for these companies. We've Mimi spending money we've cause every,

47
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.810
nobody wants to feel bad, but wasting $200 and not getting what they want.

48
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.610
So what do you do? You go to Twitter,

49
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.720
you tweet out how you didn't get anything and you pick like the pain pill pack

50
00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:33.554
or whatever it's called.

51
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.220
<v 1>[Inaudible] that's like a dad trying to</v>

52
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.450
[inaudible]. Is that Peyton pecker. Oh, that is, that is our POG champ. 

53
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.283
[inaudible]

54
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.283
Oh God stop.

55
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.510
<v 0>Meaning about me being a boomer for one second. Listen,</v>

56
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.280
we have all like trick each other into making gambling,

57
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:03.910
like a community event and like enjoying it. Yeah.

58
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.060
Because no one wants to lose alone because we share the pain. Right.

59
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.490
And we share the same pain picker we've done.

60
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.130
What exactly what these companies wanted us to do,

61
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.180
which is make like the gambling into like a form of acceptance.

62
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.060
Like you're not truly, you haven't joined yet. You haven't joined the gotcha.

63
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.290
Unless you get a thousand bucks and haven't got the one with thick thighs.

64
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.610
You forget about three months later.

65
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.010
<v 1>No. Are you telling me that part of like the gambling experience?</v>

66
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.330
Like you go into a casino. I remember the last time I went to casino with you.

67
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.750
Great time, because you got to, you egged on Eugene, like loses money.

68
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.940
Hilarious. That was funny. Eugene's our friends. Um,

69
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.710
so you basically did the exact same thing.

70
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.020
<v 0>Well, what happened was is that I, you know,</v>

71
00:03:46.021 --> 00:03:49.440
at the time he didn't have a job and we were telling him, you know,

72
00:03:49.441 --> 00:03:52.140
you probably shouldn't be spending your money. But I was like, you know,

73
00:03:52.141 --> 00:03:54.150
I kept playing, I didn't lose much like a hundred bucks.

74
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.480
I was spending that much and he wanted to keep up with me. And I was like,

75
00:03:57.481 --> 00:03:58.650
if you want to, you can go ahead.

76
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.250
<v 1>I don't know, man. That sounds very suggestible to me. Anyway,</v>

77
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.750
I'm going to get the reverse psychology. Right? It's like, it's like,

78
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.210
I'm going to do a 10 pole. I mean, you don't have to do it. I just

79
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.680
[inaudible].

80
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.370
<v 0>Yeah. I'm not sitting. I'm not streaming me going to a casino. It'd be like,</v>

81
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.760
Hey guys, let's gamble. And blackjack, hog man got blackjack. You know.

82
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.310
<v 1>If the equivalent equivalent of that, I mean, it is. I mean, like I said,</v>

83
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.000
gotcha.

84
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.970
<v 0>A wife, you could see, you know, stream gambling. Is that poker?</v>

85
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.130
<v 1>I know Jack, can you.</v>

86
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.900
<v 0>Is that there's pretty heavy rules around it though, right?</v>

87
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.770
There's not heavy rules around Gacha no, I guess why not? Why not?

88
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.080
Should that be, should that be? I don't know. Honestly, should be.

89
00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:44.430
I think there should be some regulations.

90
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.360
I feel like the biggest thing about Gacha is that people should know what

91
00:04:48.361 --> 00:04:51.000
they're getting themselves into. Um, people should know a lot of things.

92
00:04:51.001 --> 00:04:55.410
That's why that's why people should also have the option to tell casinos, Hey,

93
00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:57.660
can you ban me? Because I have no self control.

94
00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.580
There's no way to do that with catch-up.

95
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.530
And unfortunately I like to see is that,

96
00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:05.250
is that an option with casinos in every country? You can do that. You can,

97
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.353
you can basically.

98
00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.730
So what you're saying is we need to come up with like the Gacha police.

99
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.260
<v 1>You visually need something,</v>

100
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.050
you need something spending too much money. I am dead serious.

101
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.650
<v 0>Be something on the light play store, something that you can be like, listen,</v>

102
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.000
I gambled too much.

103
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.110
Can you please not allow me to spend more than like a hundred bucks,

104
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.010
like a year or something like set it hard limit that there's no way to turn off.

105
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:32.160
I agree with you with that. Because if you go to the casinos,

106
00:05:32.161 --> 00:05:34.620
you fill out the form says, please ban me from this casino.

107
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.810
They will never let you in ever like,

108
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.350
because they have like a database and a lot of the time, if you, uh,

109
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.260
I think sometimes some courts require you to do it for certain occasions,

110
00:05:43.261 --> 00:05:47.070
but it's very popular and common that people who gamble too much to what they

111
00:05:47.071 --> 00:05:49.490
want to get that life on track. You know, because it's,

112
00:05:49.491 --> 00:05:54.030
it's easy to have a lapse in like willpower and you go to the casino. Yeah.

113
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.070
So if 95% of the time, you're like, I'm never gambling chastity belt themselves.

114
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.560
Right. Basically you can say like, this is not good for me.

115
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.450
I'm going to fill out a form. I didn't know.

116
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:06.290
You can do that in the UK a hundred percent because it's gambling is a huge

117
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:09.500
problem in the UK for like betting shops and stuff. So they'll, they'll do it.

118
00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:11.480
And you can basically, if it's a chain as well,

119
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.610
they'll ban you from every chain. I'm not sure.

120
00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.590
<v 1>Well, but like I, I do, I do think you're talking about a, like a vast minority,</v>

121
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.500
cause like most of the people who I've met, who have,

122
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.170
who are playing gotcha games. They've they're not like, no, no,

123
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.920
they're not like us. Right. But for us, it's kinda like, like for me, at least,

124
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.380
you know, it's, it's kind of like, it kind of revolves around my job.

125
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.540
You know what I mean? You stream.

126
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.430
<v 0>You stream. It gets views. Right?</v>

127
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.650
<v 1>Exactly. But like for most people that I know that play. Gotcha.</v>

128
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.350
They haven't spent like an inordinate amount of money on it.

129
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.831
<v 0>But like,</v>

130
00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:43.170
I don't think there should be an ability to ruin your life for falling animate

131
00:06:43.171 --> 00:06:47.890
girls though. Because like we know Taxstone, who's a popular, uh,

132
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.090
Gacha game streamer. And at one point he used to play, what was it? Um,

133
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.150
Summoners war. He nearly like, I think he went homeless.

134
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.640
He legit went like finance. He like,

135
00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:59.500
I think he might've filed a bankruptcy or something.

136
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.780
He went fully broke from Gacha games.

137
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.350
This should never be a thing that should never be him telling me.

138
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.580
<v 1>Like, it was like a,</v>

139
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.870
like one story that should never be a thing for casinos either. Right? Yeah. No,

140
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.440
but I mean, there's more, I agree. There should be more regulations about it.

141
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.480
There needs to be a gotcha police. That's all we need.
