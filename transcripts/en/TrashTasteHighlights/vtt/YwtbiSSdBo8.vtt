00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.530
<v 0>What is your perfect gaming experience corner? What is your perfect game? No,</v>

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.770
off. Play whatever. Say that.

3
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.210
<v 1>Why do you play so well? That's a good question. Jerry addiction.</v>

4
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.230
There should be a systems.

5
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.070
<v 0>What the hell you mean?</v>

6
00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:17.810
But league addiction is a thing.

7
00:00:17.811 --> 00:00:20.090
Don't try to show me that you don't try to tell me.

8
00:00:20.091 --> 00:00:22.310
League addiction is not a thing. It is a thing.

9
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.741
<v 1>I mean, it's,</v>

10
00:00:24.741 --> 00:00:27.800
you have to try very hard to ruin your life with a league addiction.

11
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.930
You have to really be on that path. Um, but I don't know. Perfect game for me.

12
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.150
I don't know. Maybe like something like one of the halo games,

13
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.790
it was a very good game. Perfect game experience. You get a good game.

14
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.360
Maybe some of the ways some of them had like DLC, but was like,

15
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.130
Oh gee halo. Yeah. Oh, gee here. Hello. One, two, hello,

16
00:00:49.131 --> 00:00:50.180
one or two really good games.

17
00:00:50.181 --> 00:00:52.430
Just a game that has an experience that is when it's over.

18
00:00:52.431 --> 00:00:53.690
It's like a current game.

19
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.170
A current game was Haiti's is probably the best game I've played recently.

20
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.520
Right? That's a fantastic example of a game. No DLC, no. You just play the game.

21
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.990
You know, you get the story. If you want that. I'm not into that. That ain't me.

22
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.420
So the game played amazing to me.

23
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.280
<v 0>To me, like I, 90% of the games I ever play, I don't finish.</v>

24
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.110
I don't know why such I can weak mindset. Like I get to a point.

25
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.740
<v 1>During sex and you just walk out halfway through.</v>

26
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.290
<v 0>[Inaudible] 40 to 50 hours. I don't play.</v>

27
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.300
<v 1>Fantasy. I don't, I don't play your coups, Atlanta, those long games.</v>

28
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.850
So that's the longest get my players like blue dragon or some. And I was like,

29
00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:38.684
I have to be like.

30
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.320
<v 0>We invested in this stuff. And I'm the type of guy who, you know,</v>

31
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.880
I get really into a game. And then I hit a route like the 20 hour Mark.

32
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.510
And then I still have a quarter of the story left or a quarter of the gameplay

33
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:54.110
left. And I feel like I've gotten everything out of that game that I need to do.

34
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.210
And then I just stopped playing. Know what I mean?

35
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.330
Like part of a big reason why I, you know,

36
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.020
even with Gacha games is that if there's not that's reason for me to keep

37
00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:05.720
playing or if there's not that if I'm not getting something new out of it,

38
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.410
then I.

39
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.900
<v 1>Drop it. What do you mean? It's just a daily question every day.</v>

40
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.100
<v 0>Sometimes I like the story. Sometimes I, you know, sometimes it is, you know,</v>

41
00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:17.480
sometimes I'm sometimes you want to get that grind for that character. The,

42
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.190
you said story, he just checked out.

43
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.360
I could see his brain just power down.

44
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.730
<v 1>I don't fathom why people want to grind. Like why,</v>

45
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.210
why aren't people put themselves through that? It's it's torture. I mean, it's,

46
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.070
it's kinda like just that mindless task, right?

47
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.700
<v 0>Do you feel like you're accomplishing something?</v>

48
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.690
I know you're telling me that league, isn't a grind after a point it's a grind.

49
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.110
It's just, it's just a grind with more complicated controls.

50
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.243
You know what I mean?

51
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.220
<v 1>Like a win or a loss have different outcomes, grind. There's only one outcome.</v>

52
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.380
You just win. You just, you do the thing that you meant to do.

53
00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:53.840
And then you've already planned how you grind you. But it's like, all right,

54
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:54.920
I've got my spreadsheet out.

55
00:02:54.921 --> 00:02:57.470
It's going to take eight years of grinding of killing these balls.

56
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.050
<v 0>What is, what, what is that? We have a sprint.</v>

57
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.660
<v 1>No, but in your mind, it's like,</v>

58
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.300
I'm going to do this mindless task five times to get this.

59
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.120
What is the end goal of league? There is no end goal.

60
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.920
It's like self-improvement in mechanics.

61
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.570
<v 0>That's exactly right. Because that's my problem with competitive games. I,</v>

62
00:03:15.571 --> 00:03:18.420
you know, you, every time we get to do a competitive game,

63
00:03:18.421 --> 00:03:21.090
whether it be league Overwatch, um,

64
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.990
Valor and whatever is like the golden period is the first time when you're

65
00:03:24.991 --> 00:03:27.210
learning the game. Right? And they start getting good at the game.

66
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.910
And then you start learning the systems and then you start the ranks.

67
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.540
You start the ranks playing, you start climbing. That's when the game is fun.

68
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.770
When you feel like what you've learned has had a tangible effect, right?

69
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.350
But everyone, everyone will hit that ball.

70
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.290
Everyone will hit that wall where you climb as hard as you can,

71
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.180
unless you're fake or something you've won.

72
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.580
And then you've won like the ball tournament. That's cause that's,

73
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.890
that is basically the only end goal.

74
00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:52.890
There can be in any competitive game to be the best in the world. Right.

75
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.670
And so everyone will reach a point where it becomes a grind because there's,

76
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.870
there's no way that you can overcome that wall without grinding your weight,

77
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.650
overcome that war. And then that's a self-improvement and then you reach.

78
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.100
And then after you do that, you reach another wall and another wall after.

79
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.790
<v 1>But it's constantly like improving a skill, but in like GLP GS, and you know,</v>

80
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.760
Gacha games often it requires no skill to do the grinding. In fact,

81
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:15.780
they requires the opposite.

82
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:20.070
<v 0>What I'm saying is you feel like you're because the whole you're working towards</v>

83
00:04:20.071 --> 00:04:20.471
a goal.

84
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:23.370
You're you're you're like you talked about self-improvement while you're working

85
00:04:23.371 --> 00:04:27.330
towards a goal, you're you're gaining something to us. Gacha games is just that.

86
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.820
I mean, like we've, we've not just gadget games, but like,

87
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.580
I'm pretty sure I'd like any MMO, right. When you're grinding,

88
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.280
you just feel like you're making progress towards something. You just,

89
00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.150
you're just.

90
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.730
<v 1>That's like fun to people. Just having the thing,</v>

91
00:04:38.731 --> 00:04:40.470
like the super easy thing to just play out.

92
00:04:40.471 --> 00:04:43.230
And you're like not engaged at all just because you're going towards.

93
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.050
<v 0>Yeah. You know,</v>

94
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.990
sometimes I don't want to feel when I've played five league games and lost five

95
00:04:48.991 --> 00:04:53.220
in a row. And I've just like play games to have fun. It's it's, it's just like,

96
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.700
you're just activating, like the neurons. You don't need to worry about it.

97
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.430
<v 1>Like being lost. I just liked being challenged constantly.</v>

98
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.380
Like I want something that like is challenging.

99
00:05:01.381 --> 00:05:05.520
You always like at the moment you grind died, what do you mean?

100
00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:07.140
I don't know why I like being challenged.

101
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.980
<v 0>Do you not feel like competitive games gets, get to grind, get,</v>

102
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.890
get to a grind after a point? Do you not feel like.

103
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.560
<v 1>You gets to a point where I feel like, okay, I genuinely think,</v>

104
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.200
unless I put X amount of effort, I'm not gonna improve at this game.

105
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.200
I normally just quit at that point because I'm like, all right.

106
00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:25.320
I feel like I've gotten all the challenge I can out of this game in a reasonable

107
00:05:25.321 --> 00:05:27.240
amount of time. I'm going to find something else.

108
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.760
<v 0>Yeah. And that's exactly the same for me when I,</v>

109
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.980
when it reached the point where I reached that grind.

110
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.630
<v 1>Gotcha. Games have auto-play so what are you doing? Sorry? What are you doing?</v>

111
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.670
Are you, do you find that [inaudible].

112
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.430
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, that's, that's why, that's why, you know,</v>

113
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.360
the only times I'm okay with autoplay is when it's on a mobile,

114
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.630
because that's staring at my phone while it's auto playing the entire time I'm

115
00:05:48.631 --> 00:05:49.410
doing other.

116
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.161
<v 1>Yeah. But I haven't,</v>

117
00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:52.620
because I've been out with you and your auto playing on the thing and you gotta

118
00:05:52.621 --> 00:05:54.780
like keep track of it a little bit, make sure it's all going well, you're like,

119
00:05:54.781 --> 00:05:55.560
okay.

120
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.130
<v 0>For like two seconds, you also can't use.</v>

121
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.110
<v 1>Your phone in that time because you're doing the mission.</v>

122
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:02.540
So you can't apply to any other things to do. Then look at my phone.

123
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.570
I have emails to reply to Joey. I have, you know, messages.

124
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.580
I've got to reply to you, man. You know, it's busy life. But.

125
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.713
<v 0>You know.</v>

126
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.720
<v 1>I also would like not my battery,</v>

127
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:14.800
which is like really annoying on the Gacha games is that when I was playing arc

128
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.160
nights, my I had to carry a spare charger with me everywhere, dying.

129
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.400
<v 0>When Gacha games stopped,</v>

130
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.540
getting fun is the moment I start thinking about optimization because when I

131
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.870
start thinking about optimization, I'm just like, okay, now, now I'm just,

132
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.770
now I'm just like.

133
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.570
<v 1>Right. The challenge for me in,</v>

134
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.490
because once I figured out how I can optimize this game,

135
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.650
maximize that it's not funny,

136
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.030
but I figured that out immediately because of all the online and everyone tells

137
00:06:43.031 --> 00:06:45.130
you how to do it. So I want you to, you've seen the spreadsheet.

138
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.290
<v 0>You basically like just willingly as like,</v>

139
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.580
I just figured out a way to make this game not fun when you're stuck,

140
00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.570
when you're, when you're opening up a spreadsheets and you know,

141
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.750
actually you're thinking about how to optimize this and optimize that.

142
00:06:58.751 --> 00:06:59.770
That's when it stops getting fun.

143
00:06:59.771 --> 00:07:02.830
I just like the experience of just doing like a very,

144
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.130
like a very simple activity. I don't need to worry about it.

145
00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:08.770
And I just feel like I'm gaining something and it's not,

146
00:07:08.771 --> 00:07:12.430
I'm not going to say that, Hey, this is the peak of all entertainment.

147
00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:15.070
This is why I play video. I guess. I know what I mean.

148
00:07:15.071 --> 00:07:16.600
It's just a nice little thing in the bathroom.

149
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.480
<v 1>I don't understand, like my brain can not wrap around the thought of just,</v>

150
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:20.710
I'm just progressing.

151
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:21.790
<v 0>Beyond the monkey brain. And.</v>

152
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.200
<v 1>To me, the idea of progressing to a goal without actually doing anything,</v>

153
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.930
it seems like the dumbest thing ever. Like why,

154
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:30.850
how is it a goal if you're not progress.

155
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.790
<v 0>Because life is stressful enough, bro. Like</v>

156
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.800
really a challenge. We don't want another challenge on the side.

157
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.030
<v 1>Distress by getting like challenged to do stuff outside of like,</v>

158
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.020
because there's no pressure. If I lose in a ranked game, I don't give a.

159
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.190
It's my I'm not going to get my mortgage taken away from me. Like I said,

160
00:07:51.191 --> 00:07:52.150
nothing like that. Right.

161
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:56.720
<v 0>With a mindset like that. I'm surprised you're not a speed runner. No, no, no,</v>

162
00:07:56.721 --> 00:07:59.260
no, because that's the exact same mentality I feel.

163
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.180
<v 1>No, no, no, no. That's psychosis. Cause that's like,</v>

164
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.510
I want the same experience again with a minute difference. That,

165
00:08:04.511 --> 00:08:06.220
that to me like blows my mind.

166
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.480
<v 2>Like that's exactly what I'm hearing right now. No.</v>

167
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.290
<v 1>Because when I get done with the challenge I'm done, I'm done with another game,</v>

168
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.950
right? Like these speed runners will spend like two months to get a one second

169
00:08:14.951 --> 00:08:18.610
optimization. Right. And I'm like all of that optimization. Yeah.

170
00:08:18.611 --> 00:08:21.250
And other things, but not my, not my like complete my fun.

171
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.560
Like my fun is learning something and getting better at it. Like I.

172
00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:25.580
<v 0>I mean,</v>

173
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.780
wouldn't you say that that is speed runners because they're learning a game.

174
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:31.570
<v 1>An obsessive amount though.</v>

175
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.200
I think like I get it this cause I've I got into like speed running,

176
00:08:35.201 --> 00:08:37.810
like cop had at one point that was quite fun because I was seeing good

177
00:08:37.811 --> 00:08:38.644
improvements.

178
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.510
But the moment it became not fun is when I would do a 40 minute run and I was

179
00:08:43.511 --> 00:08:45.340
just like, whatever, you know what to do now,

180
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:46.690
I didn't really see much in to improve.

181
00:08:46.691 --> 00:08:48.700
And then I would look on the line and I'll be like, okay, I guess I can,

182
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:50.320
I can do this. But then yeah.

183
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.020
Show the mechanical aspect of trying to get better at like a certain thing was

184
00:08:53.021 --> 00:08:57.090
better, but it was a challenge, but it was, it was, it was not.

185
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.530
When you play against other players,

186
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:01.050
there is always in constant direct challenge facing you.

187
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:05.070
And every second there is constant decisions you have to make to outplay.

188
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.740
And every new game is a new experience. Right?

189
00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:09.720
There's a lot of things that are the same. But with the speed run,

190
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:12.420
I think the problem I have with it is that it's always like we follow the

191
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:15.450
formula and then we try and improve on the formula a little by little,

192
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.610
which is not kind of fun because if you're doing, like,

193
00:09:17.611 --> 00:09:19.560
when people do like three hour games, that speed runs,

194
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:23.640
it's like they might do like a two second optimization here and then redo

195
00:09:23.641 --> 00:09:26.130
everything the same way. Right. That sounds like insanity to me.

196
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.740
You're not changing anything. There's no variation.

197
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.590
You're just changing one detail, constantly trying to improve it. And sure.

198
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.650
I can understand why that's fun to someone, but for me, I can't do that.

199
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.470
And I just, I just can't get invested in that. That's just not what I do.

200
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.080
<v 0>Well, do you get invested in then,</v>

201
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:43.550
like self-improvement what is your definition of fun?

202
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:44.953
What is fun?

203
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:46.700
<v 1>It's a skill. Right?</v>

204
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.570
And then seeing how well I can apply the skill on the fly to things like how

205
00:09:50.571 --> 00:09:53.270
well I can learn it and adapt to situations is what's fun to me.

206
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.130
I like losing because that means I can get back.

207
00:09:56.060 --> 00:10:00.860
<v 0>For me. I play video games. Cause I just like escapism, escapism. Yeah.</v>

208
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.910
To me video games. I like, I do this, I do that enough in my real life.

209
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:05.530
You know what I mean? If,

210
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.600
if probably that's probably why I watch so many Eastern Carolina,

211
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:14.120
I'm just realizing this now man. But no, like I gave to another world, but yeah,

212
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.150
it's, it's just like, I want to do something where it's, you know,

213
00:10:17.151 --> 00:10:18.380
sometimes with Gacha games, you know,

214
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.200
there's no way you could lose that a gotcha game unless you were spending money.

215
00:10:21.201 --> 00:10:24.260
But like, like in terms of like the grindy and the progress,

216
00:10:24.261 --> 00:10:25.850
there's no way to lose against it. Yeah.

217
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.480
<v 1>So you just don't like losing. Hm. You don't like losing, like losing,</v>

218
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.760
losing experience. No,

219
00:10:31.761 --> 00:10:35.060
it's not every fighting game players obsessed with losing. I swear.

220
00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:39.440
<v 0>Was psychotic. That's like some martial arts mantra dog. Yes.</v>
