00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.730
<v 0>I already liked the way Disney does things with properties.</v>

2
00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.680
And it's worrying that they're acquiring so much that they have so much control

3
00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:10.590
of the things because yeah, Disney movie is streamlined and it's nice,

4
00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:14.450
but you don't, you don't get the weird from Disney. That's what I'm saying.

5
00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:17.180
Like, when I, when I heard about that supposedly room moral,

6
00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.810
whatever it was like, I wasn't like immediately, Oh, that's.

7
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.260
That's never going to happen because there is a very likely chance.

8
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.680
It very much might happen. Yeah. And if it does happen,

9
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.140
then it's going to be really bad for animate.

10
00:00:30.141 --> 00:00:33.770
Like anime is going to get boring when that happens. I mean,

11
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.270
what I was saying now is that,

12
00:00:35.271 --> 00:00:39.470
so like we can basically break down like the main plays to be Crunchyroll.

13
00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:43.970
Funimation Netflix of like punchline Funimation and Netflix and you know,

14
00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:46.610
there's, you know, central, I feel most soon doing their own thing. Yeah.

15
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.090
But I will say that the, putting those two together,

16
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.090
like they do have very different brands like this, you know,

17
00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:55.520
sometimes you watch an anime and you're like, yeah, this seems,

18
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.140
this feels like a Netflix show.

19
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.130
I mean like B stars felt like it belonged on Netflix dev Mac fly,

20
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.960
maybe felt like it belonged on Netflix.

21
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.740
What I would say when it was like crunchy roll versus Funimation is that they

22
00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:09.440
have like exact same branding. So I'm just like, Oh,

23
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.680
Cargill has Cargill summer's on French road then on Funimation like what?

24
00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:15.050
Like season two's on fundamentals. Like I, you know,

25
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.410
cause like they were both trying to acquire the same show. It's it's,

26
00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:20.390
it's the same type of consumers.

27
00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:23.240
I feel that use both Funimation and crunch roll. And you know,

28
00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:26.540
not to say that crunch all users don't use Netflix and vice versa,

29
00:01:26.541 --> 00:01:29.780
but I feel that like, yeah, as you said, there's like a certain,

30
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.750
I don't know what the right word for it is. Edginess.

31
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.600
When it comes to shows on Netflix, I don't,

32
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.630
I don't know what the right word for it is. Is that,

33
00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:41.630
that cooler older brother who comes in and is like, Hey,

34
00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:45.920
you ever played a game boy like that? You know what I mean?

35
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.640
Like that vibe we've all seen. We've obviously done work with Netflix.

36
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.470
So this is totally like separated from, from that. But I mean,

37
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.590
that service is the best man. Like, I mean, you, you, I mean,

38
00:01:57.591 --> 00:02:01.510
obviously the Netflix jail stuff sucks sometimes at least in Japan,

39
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.330
the subtitle differences. Again, those, we obviously know that sucks,

40
00:02:05.331 --> 00:02:09.380
but I mean, you use that player and it's like, you can't beat that shot. No,

41
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.180
you can download it. And now you can do audio only on, uh, on the mobile,

42
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.390
which I love. Cause you used to have to keep,

43
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.900
when I used to listen to stuff on Netflix,

44
00:02:17.901 --> 00:02:20.810
I used to have to keep my phone open in my pocket, like the screen going,

45
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.510
but now you can just do audio only. And it's like, Oh my God. It's like,

46
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.430
they know what I want. The question is then what would you watch?

47
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.490
What kind of content would work for audio? Only stuff like documentaries.

48
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.560
It's just like sometimes right? I'm like,

49
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.300
I'm in a situation where I couldn't do that for anime.

50
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.380
I'm in a situation where I can't look at my screen for like just two minutes.

51
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.510
Yeah. But cause I'm like, maybe I'm getting off the train.

52
00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:42.890
Maybe I'm walking around real quick. I just want to,

53
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.540
I just want to lock my phone, but I want to keep listening.

54
00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:45.590
It's got my headphones on.

55
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.350
So just quick little moments where you just want to turn it off,

56
00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:52.010
but you don't want like content to just stop. Right? Right. Honestly,

57
00:02:52.011 --> 00:02:55.820
the big thing for me for Netflix is, uh, the skip opening button.

58
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.700
Skip openings also just added the two times. Speed. One five. So now you can,

59
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.800
if you want to be a bastard more channel. Yeah. I know.

60
00:03:04.801 --> 00:03:08.760
It's so Cardinal sin to say you could skip opening anime openings,

61
00:03:08.761 --> 00:03:09.900
but that's,

62
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.380
that's made it so much more easier to watch some of the anime because let's be

63
00:03:13.381 --> 00:03:17.070
honest. Let's be honest what you do automatically for endings. Yeah.

64
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.910
Yeah. Cause every time the great pretend to end it. I'm like, no, no, no. Yeah.

65
00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.270
Sometimes you do watch the ending and sometimes you do listen to the opening,

66
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.050
but let's be honest. Most of the time you skip the,

67
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.050
you want to skip the opening.

68
00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:33.890
You watch the opening once and it's another generic Jason

69
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.840
[inaudible] and I love bingeing anime. I don't watch anime weekly. So for me,

70
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.120
like, unless it's a banger of an opening,

71
00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:44.400
which is there's always one or two shows every season,

72
00:03:44.401 --> 00:03:46.590
but it's like every be stars was one.

73
00:03:46.591 --> 00:03:50.940
Like I always with amazing opening mob, psycho as well.

74
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.780
Don't skip it. Just leave it. Just leave it Netflix. Come on. Just let it flow.

75
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.340
I want to watch this. Yeah, that's great. Yeah. Like, like you said, like, uh,

76
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.180
the great pretender ending, which is like you've,

77
00:04:02.181 --> 00:04:04.950
you've always got time for Freddie mercury. Come on. You've always got done.

78
00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:07.620
Never skip for anymore time. Is it? I've got time regardless.

79
00:04:07.621 --> 00:04:10.470
You know what I mean? And you can download episodes.

80
00:04:10.471 --> 00:04:14.550
I know you can do that crunchy roll. Now you can do,

81
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.280
you can pay extra to download a crunch roll. I have never tried it.

82
00:04:17.281 --> 00:04:20.160
So I don't know how good the services, um,

83
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.450
cause I know you can do on Funimation but it didn't work that good.

84
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.430
That was like always the biggest complaint foundation.

85
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.620
I just said that the website was garbage. Yeah. As far as I know, I mean,

86
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:32.370
I would a knock on, you said don't live in the U S what do you, what do you,

87
00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:34.380
what do you think the plan is with Sony?

88
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.780
Like why do you think they decided that's a good question.

89
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.740
That's what I've always wanted to know again. Right? It's like what,

90
00:04:40.741 --> 00:04:43.620
what is it about Crunchyroll? And Funimation that's Sonny was like,

91
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.430
Sony drove a billion bucks on this study. He has a movie division. That's right.

92
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.920
I make a big branch, a big part of that business.

93
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.090
So do you think we'll start to see like maybe like funding, Sony,

94
00:04:54.091 --> 00:04:58.530
original anime on control inflammation? Maybe. I dunno. Like,

95
00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.140
cause they have to compete with Netflix originals, right? Yeah.

96
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.340
I mean right now,

97
00:05:02.341 --> 00:05:07.230
I mean Sony kind of Sonya already on like the production committee to a

98
00:05:07.231 --> 00:05:09.480
lot of anime cleaning, like big enemies.

99
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.960
Like I th I think isn't it like the demon Slayer. Oh yeah.

100
00:05:12.961 --> 00:05:16.530
They think they're funny demon slab. Cause that's yeah. I actually,

101
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.540
I might be talking to my office. The, which company does Sony own.

102
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:24.480
Is it anyplace? [inaudible]

103
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.210
I'm pretty sure it's very shiny. The place was with Damon Slayer. Yeah.

104
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.780
They usually with like the majority of the big shown in,

105
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.410
or then it only make sense that they'd want to get a big grip on the Western

106
00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:36.060
market. I mean, if you're, if you're funding this,

107
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.880
you already have a lot of say. Hmm. I mean, I,

108
00:05:37.881 --> 00:05:39.960
I think right now I don't know what their plans are,

109
00:05:39.961 --> 00:05:44.250
but I think the amount of money they throw at it just shows how much potential

110
00:05:44.251 --> 00:05:46.830
they see for the anime market. Right? Yeah. For real,

111
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.360
it's a gold rush right now.

112
00:05:48.361 --> 00:05:51.270
I think really like I think all of the companies have vibe like fighting to get

113
00:05:51.271 --> 00:05:54.090
control over the Western market. Cause they realized like this big,

114
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.160
it's like an IP race. Right. [inaudible] essentially,

115
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.070
while it's still young and it still isn't fully settled. Right.

116
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:01.881
Which is now like,

117
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:04.730
why wouldn't you just throw money at the and try and get y'all, you know,

118
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.330
don't get all the IPS get older. I mean,

119
00:06:07.331 --> 00:06:12.250
D do you see like animate becoming as big as say like gaming or like other

120
00:06:12.251 --> 00:06:17.170
things? Yeah. Maybe. Maybe not like and Thai, but yeah.

121
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.820
Maybe, maybe not, man. Hey man. You just wait, you just wait boy, you just wait,

122
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:22.451
you just wait,

123
00:06:22.451 --> 00:06:25.900
you just wait until I drop my original hand tie and then we'll see how big it

124
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.280
is. But listen, listen. Right. Everyone watches porn, right? Yeah.

125
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.140
But there isn't no like Avengers of porn.

126
00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.620
No one's discussing like there's no podcasts about porn. I don't think actually,

127
00:06:35.621 --> 00:06:37.060
maybe there's, you know, there's no,

128
00:06:37.061 --> 00:06:40.790
there's a big discussions about porn and like, Oh my God. What's what's who,

129
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.420
whose ex who's Johnny, scene's gonna next. Johnny.

130
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.700
Johnny seems the captain America or porn.

131
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.030
It's not going to be that God get your hopes down now. Right?

132
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.560
I mean there's no man. Isn't like porn hub. One of what? Like in like the top 20

133
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.820
[inaudible] 60% of their libraries.
