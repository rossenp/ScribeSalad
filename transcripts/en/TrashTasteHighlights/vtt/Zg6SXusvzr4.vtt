00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.300
<v 0>Because I, I love watching artists. Twitter is my favorite. How they.</v>

2
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.850
<v 1>Artists Twitter is like watching trash TV to me. It's.</v>

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.440
<v 0>Like, you can just go out if you can just grab the.</v>

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.260
<v 1>Popcorn. And it's like watching 90 day fiance or something, you know,</v>

5
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.150
it's like the amount,

6
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.110
the amount of tea that is spilt on like artists, Twitter,

7
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.530
like it's, it's,

8
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.230
it's more T than the Americans threw into the water when they gained

9
00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:26.240
independence, man, my God, I don't know why,

10
00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:30.440
but it's why is it almost always written in lowercase? It's like, it's never,

11
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.170
it's never proper punctuation. They're just like,

12
00:00:33.171 --> 00:00:37.970
let's just make it as low a case as possible, seven, seven tweet thread.

13
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.690
And it's just like, it's,

14
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:42.350
it's just that you could have summed up into just one time.

15
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.490
<v 0>Yeah. There's a lot of funny ones. I love it as well when it's like people,</v>

16
00:00:46.491 --> 00:00:50.180
just artists to like, um, giving advice to each other and they're just like,

17
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.070
they all like repeat the same stuff.

18
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.740
And it's always interesting sometimes because they'll be like, yeah,

19
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.130
you should charge people for your art. And I'm like, is this like not known?

20
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.480
Like I should charge people for work. Well,

21
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.910
apparently it's pretty hot. Like, it's pretty common that, I mean,

22
00:01:04.911 --> 00:01:09.020
you see the messages I'm like for exposure, right? For exposures,

23
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:12.260
a Twitter account. People like ask people that do things for exposure. Yeah.

24
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.430
Which is very funny. And it's true. But an unpopular, you just keep doing work.

25
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.240
That artist should get paid. I wouldn't do an unpopular take. Right.

26
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.120
Don't don't count me for this. But uh, honest, you get paid for that,

27
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.280
to be fair though, Joe called that. But a lot of voice actors,

28
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.020
like where they start out, they'll get like, they'll,

29
00:01:33.021 --> 00:01:36.500
they'll spend all their money on like the new stuff and then they'll be like,

30
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.660
yeah, yeah. I'll, I'll do a commercial for free cause.

31
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.880
<v 1>Cause people, cause it's, it's different with.</v>

32
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.130
<v 0>Artists and I think voice actors, cause voice actors,</v>

33
00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:45.680
like you get credits [inaudible] credits.

34
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.740
So it's like a race everyone's just like de-valuing themselves. Cause I like,

35
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.150
yeah, I'll do your, your Kellogg's commercial for $2 and a Kit-Kat ball.

36
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.310
Like let's that's fair that she was good at my name's on the credits side,

37
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.540
right? Yeah. Yeah.

38
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.280
<v 1>Well I think that there is a balance that should be taken because there is value</v>

39
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.390
in cloud basically. I mean, that's, that's, that's how we make our money. Right.

40
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.540
It's literally, it's literally, we are monetizing clouds. That is,

41
00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:11.630
that is the modern day. We are, we are cloud chasers as an.

42
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.250
<v 0>Occupant, but like yeah.</v>

43
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.010
<v 1>No, no, but like I, I get, you know,</v>

44
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.470
artists should definitely be paid and you definitely have a skill set,

45
00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:21.530
but there's, there's also building up your personal branding as well,

46
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.350
which you have to worry about and you know, is it a problem, right?

47
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.820
Is that so many artists starting out?

48
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.810
They don't see themselves as a brand because of that artist mentality. Right?

49
00:02:29.811 --> 00:02:32.780
They're not like, Oh no, I'm just doing it because I like drawing.

50
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.210
I don't want to make this a profession. But then they make,

51
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.510
they make one piece where it's really popular and getting shared everywhere.

52
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:43.310
And then suddenly they're like, actually I'm a brand. Um, you're stealing.

53
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.570
Yeah. Yeah. Cause I've seen,

54
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.190
I've seen the exact opposite of like talented artists who just don't know how to

55
00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:49.761
charge here,

56
00:02:49.761 --> 00:02:53.420
where you have like an artist who has like two drawings on their portfolio or

57
00:02:53.421 --> 00:02:57.770
something and are charging like ridiculous amounts of money. And it's just like,

58
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.340
come on. There's there, there is balance that that needs to be taken.

59
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.680
<v 0>Here. Right? Oh yeah. My favorite is when they, like,</v>

60
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.030
I've worked with some artists before and like great. You know, it's all good.

61
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.240
Um, you know, and it's, it's all reasonable. The prices seem fair.

62
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.970
And then I'm like, Oh yeah. It's like for like commercial use or whatever.

63
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:15.940
And they're like, Oh, Oh, you're like selling it. And then they might like,

64
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.870
they might try and figure, okay, you make this much money.

65
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.310
It's now worth 10,000 for this piece. That's like that. Like what, what do you,

66
00:03:23.311 --> 00:03:27.720
what do you mean? Okay. I'm pretty sure on your website. It said 20 old

67
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.780
looks of industry standard rates. Right. Okay. Well I know Pepsi,

68
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.830
which is basically the Fiverr environment. Right? How,

69
00:03:37.831 --> 00:03:39.990
how was it like working with people and how would you like,

70
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.750
how do you know how much you're worth and it's how to sell it. Right.

71
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.940
Because I think I'm five herds, inherently people like de-value themselves,

72
00:03:47.941 --> 00:03:52.140
but they're all people on Fiverr who are charging like $500 for like $5.

73
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.560
Like honestly, what is like really bad quality. Yeah.

74
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.630
But then the thing is right on fiber, at least I can only speak voice actor.

75
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.080
So I've had a lot of voice actors on Fiverr and like voice actors on Fiverr.

76
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.600
It's like $5 is like, you get a very wide variety of like skill. Yeah.

77
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.810
We, you go all the way from headset. Mine because fiber doesn't,

78
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.660
there's no checks. There's no one on five and being like, yeah,

79
00:04:12.661 --> 00:04:15.630
you seem like a voice actor. You're good to go champ. It's like, Oh,

80
00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:20.100
you have something that, that your PC recognizes as an audio recording device.

81
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.820
You're good to go because it's high, no one heads,

82
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.590
all the white people with worse quality microphone, the Tyler ones screaming,

83
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.880
charging like $20 with commercial rights as an option. And I'm like,

84
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.190
what you want commercial? How do you not know what like a good microphone is,

85
00:04:38.191 --> 00:04:40.630
but you know that you should be charging for commercial. Right?

86
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.460
It's like these two things are like, come on. Like, but then five,

87
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.630
it is like gummy things as well.

88
00:04:45.631 --> 00:04:49.020
Like five a takes cuts from like the tips and five. Uh,

89
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.940
also like I don't like personally that Fiverr makes charges extra for

90
00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:57.120
like higher quality audio files. I just think you should just send a file.

91
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.511
Right?

92
00:04:57.511 --> 00:05:02.460
Like are high quality MPS people just sending MP3s kilobytes can be

93
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.980
putting the wave behind jail or something.

94
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.120
They put like wave files behind paywalls. Sometimes I'm like, why don't do that?

95
00:05:09.121 --> 00:05:11.340
Just give me the world. Why would you not do that?

96
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.370
That's like different between high quality and low quality. It doesn't matter.

97
00:05:14.371 --> 00:05:18.060
But yeah. I didn't know. the, uh,

98
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.650
voice acting industry at DLC now Jesus Christ. That's literally DLC

99
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:29.100
the Ray tracing voice acting paddle. I'm like, you gotta pay $5 extra.

100
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.680
But this was like, there's people in five are charged, like, you know,

101
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.510
who charge the street rates.

102
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.950
And I don't think Fiverr given the like fiber shouldn't be charging industry

103
00:05:37.951 --> 00:05:38.784
rates in my opinion,

104
00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.270
because it's like not really where you should be hiring industry,

105
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.350
shouldn't be hiring on five.

106
00:05:43.351 --> 00:05:45.210
And the ones that do I think should be kind of like, you know,

107
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.520
we won't get into that. Yeah. I never had that experience myself. Um, but yeah,

108
00:05:50.521 --> 00:05:54.210
no, I mean, it's, it's, it's difficult and five voice actors. Uh,

109
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.010
you just listen to that audio. You'll you'll know if works out. It's not.

110
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.690
<v 1>Just five audios. It's five, it's five, everything, everything, every creative,</v>

111
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.220
uh, job you can think of. Cause it's, I, I, the way I feel,

112
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.870
I feel about Fiverr is that it should be,

113
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:11.690
it's a good testing ground because you get to such a wide range.

114
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.830
And I feel like it would be a good place to build up your portfolio because from

115
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:18.350
what I, what I see, like,

116
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.220
it doesn't really matter where you had your education or whatever,

117
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.830
what we've really killed out care about.

118
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.080
Cause w most of the time we are the clients now we're buying the service. Yeah.

119
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.890
We just care about your portfolio. That's the thing that's most.

120
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.020
<v 0>Yeah, exactly. I'm like show me your work.</v>

121
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.500
<v 1>Portfolios and also get paid.</v>

122
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.040
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. Cause I mean, I used to recommend to voice actors. You know, if you,</v>

123
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.590
if no one's hiring you, you don't know where to start. You know,

124
00:06:41.591 --> 00:06:45.640
don't go to one of these websites that costs like $400 a year to sign up to.

125
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.630
Cause you know, you're not gonna make your money back.

126
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.840
<v 1>Yeah. Like for example, if we're hiring video, video editors,</v>

127
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.640
like we can get emails about people who are qualified for X, Y, and Z.

128
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.020
But at the end of the day,

129
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.860
we're most likely going to pick people who have worked on anime, anime videos.

130
00:06:59.861 --> 00:07:03.130
Right. Cause we know they have experience working in that field,

131
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.570
like actually know us and like videos and stuff. Exactly.

132
00:07:07.571 --> 00:07:09.530
So it that's, that's the thing it's,

133
00:07:09.531 --> 00:07:14.470
it's more about knowing your target audience and knowing what your

134
00:07:14.471 --> 00:07:15.310
personal branding is.

135
00:07:15.311 --> 00:07:19.010
And it's less important about what you put on your CV because we don't,

136
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.040
we don't really care about CVS that much. Right.

137
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.820
<v 0>For sure school you went to, is the good or not like it's all there is to it.</v>

138
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.280
<v 1>There's lots of video editors out there. Right. It's just,</v>

139
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.330
it's just a matter of.

140
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.430
<v 0>I normally go to like five or somewhere for like,</v>

141
00:07:30.431 --> 00:07:34.060
if I need something like one-off and like fast. Like I just like,

142
00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.130
because other times it's a bit of a pain to search. Right.

143
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.100
<v 1>Have you used Fiverr other than in with like in your files?</v>

144
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:44.740
<v 0>Yeah. I've used it, uh, used it for, uh, why do they use it? Uh,</v>

145
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.290
if I need something composed, because I don't know any composers. Right?

146
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.470
Like I'm making music. I go from.

147
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:55.240
<v 1>Knowing zero composers to Kevin [inaudible].</v>

148
00:07:55.510 --> 00:08:00.190
<v 0>Kevin, may I quit? I got this video idea. She's composed me a trip. Like,</v>

149
00:08:00.191 --> 00:08:01.270
so I'll go to someone I'm like,

150
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.980
I'm only like make it like a middy track of this make like a version of that.

151
00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:10.360
But it's normally very basic like thing where I'm like, copy this thing. Yeah.

152
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:11.590
Um, yeah. I mean,

153
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.710
I think I've had like some emotes on my Twitch stroll in there.

154
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.440
There's a lot of Twitter. There's a lot of Twitch stuff on.

155
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.660
<v 1>There. There's a lot of artists on Fiverr.</v>

156
00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.910
<v 0>Right? Yeah. But just. Oh my God. There's so many.</v>

157
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.520
<v 1>Oh, well quote unquote artists. Is that,</v>

158
00:08:24.521 --> 00:08:25.690
is that where you get your Twitch stuff?

159
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.550
Cause I've actually been looking to try and like upgrade my Twitch presentation

160
00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:34.540
because my Twitch presentation is because I've never given the ship about

161
00:08:34.541 --> 00:08:35.374
streaming before.

162
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.950
<v 0>On Fiverr. It's tailored towards like,</v>

163
00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:42.700
I think what the like general audience of people who are looking to get into

164
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.480
live streaming would once. Right. So it's all like very gamer looking.

165
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.590
You know what I mean? When I say that, right? Like,

166
00:08:49.591 --> 00:08:53.470
like 90% of the Fiverr stuff for like talking to that, like Twitch,

167
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:57.210
I like Twitch overlays all like something that is an application to the phase

168
00:08:57.211 --> 00:08:59.640
clan. Like it doesn't look like,

169
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.340
I would say the default ones that you get on like stream labs,

170
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:06.990
which is why I think I ended up hiring someone who I know that did a lot of this

171
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:08.700
stuff and who watched some of my stuff.

172
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:10.680
So they were kind of familiar with my mind.

173
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.470
<v 1>They mine as well.</v>

174
00:09:12.471 --> 00:09:16.790
And I met an artist recently who probably going to get high because yeah.

175
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:17.780
At the same thing, it was like, Oh,

176
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.200
cause right now I'm using like a default one. Hmm. I'm just like, she probably,

177
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.340
probably personalized it a little more. Make it stand out a little bit.

178
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.610
How'd you how'd you guys find artists, you just DM people on Twitter.

179
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.120
<v 0>Tweet out or like ask on live streams. I'm like, Hey guys, I need something.</v>

180
00:09:32.121 --> 00:09:33.950
Can someone tell me like where I go?

181
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.900
<v 1>Because I find through like them doing fan out of me. Okay. Yeah. So like the,</v>

182
00:09:38.901 --> 00:09:42.020
the, uh, the post I'm probably going to be hiring soon as rocket cut,

183
00:09:42.021 --> 00:09:45.620
who did like a bunch of like drawings with me and Chris,

184
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.920
the Jenny cross your pants off. Right. And it's really cute. So I also,

185
00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:52.040
I was like, yo, can you do some Twitch stuff? And she's like, okay. Yeah.

186
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.630
So just asking around, yeah.

187
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.240
<v 0>I have no idea what artist's worth. So whatever they give me,</v>

188
00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.780
if it's not ridiculous, I'm like, it. I'll pay that. Whatever, man,

189
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.060
I'm more comfortable being like, what do you want.

190
00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.810
<v 1>Versus like, I'll give you $15.</v>

191
00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.480
<v 0>It's always a debate. Right. Is it,</v>

192
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:13.610
is it you as the buyer should ask or should the person like the client say,

193
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.610
Hey, this is what I'm worth because I frustrates me when I hear like,

194
00:10:16.611 --> 00:10:17.560
what's your budget? And I'm like.

195
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.490
<v 1>I don't have a budget. I just wanna know what the worth, what do you want?</v>

196
00:10:21.491 --> 00:10:22.260
What's your hourly rate?

197
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.390
<v 0>Are you telling me, like, I don't know.</v>

198
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.380
I understand that that's in place where people who can't maybe afford the other

199
00:10:27.381 --> 00:10:28.214
things, but I'm like, I don't know.

200
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.260
<v 1>Whatever you think is, well, tell me I'll pay it. It's like,</v>

201
00:10:30.261 --> 00:10:32.690
it's like a standoff. Right? It's like,

202
00:10:32.691 --> 00:10:35.510
you're waiting for the first one to like, say a number. It's just like,

203
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.710
how much, how much is this worth? Like, what's your budget. I hate that debate.

204
00:10:39.711 --> 00:10:44.060
Right. I, I get it there from the artist perspective, because like,

205
00:10:44.061 --> 00:10:46.460
they're probably like, Oh, if I say it's something that's a little too high,

206
00:10:46.461 --> 00:10:48.380
then I'm afraid I might lose the client.

207
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:51.320
<v 0>Right. But that's when you can negotiate. Right. You can be like, ah,</v>

208
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.750
I think that's a little, little too high. Or was it maybe something like that?

209
00:10:53.751 --> 00:10:55.250
A lot of them starting off don't know any better.

210
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.600
<v 1>Afraid at first as well. Like when, you know, I'd get sponsorship opportunities,</v>

211
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.820
that'd be like, what do you want for it? I'm like, ah.

212
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.710
I don't know how much do you have.
