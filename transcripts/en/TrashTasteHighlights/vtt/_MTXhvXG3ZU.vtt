00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.990
<v 0>Well, I guess, I guess the thought,</v>

2
00:00:00.991 --> 00:00:05.760
I guess the thought I had was I've watched the least amount of anime this

3
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:09.570
year and I feel like a lot of people have lost you. Oh, sorry.

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.510
Last year, Hey,

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.110
I've watched the least amount of anime last year.

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.050
And I feel like a lot of people in the anime fandom have. Right.

7
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.300
And I feel like the community now is evolving from just being like,

8
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.790
there's a difference between now being an anime fan and the weave.

9
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:28.050
And we touched on this earlier,

10
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.060
but I realized this when hanging out with Connor,

11
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.370
how much of a normie Connor is compared to both?

12
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.160
<v 1>Like, how's it feel?</v>

13
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.170
<v 0>How does it say you're a normie?</v>

14
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.830
How does it feel for you hanging out with like people like us, I guess, or.

15
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.740
<v 1>What do you mean? People like, we're a different breed, apparently. What's your,</v>

16
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.290
why? Why do you think I'm a normie? First of all,

17
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.700
because you don't care about animals. My sweeter, I care about animals.

18
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.530
<v 0>You, you care about dynamo, but there's only,</v>

19
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.780
you only go so deep into the culture right.

20
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.700
Where you don't really get why food culture, you don't really get a lot of like,

21
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.340
Vici. Yeah. No, come on.

22
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.580
<v 1>Well, tubing part of the culture, I think it is. Yeah. I mean, it, it grew up,</v>

23
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.170
he grew out of the anime culture, right?

24
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.020
<v 0>I mean, you know, you gotta kind of have a,</v>

25
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:18.320
like an appreciation for anime in order to watch anime girls streaming.

26
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.360
<v 1>Uh, I, I mean, I guess, I don't know. I mean, how deep,</v>

27
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.220
how deep do you say your anime fandom goes?

28
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.870
That's a weird question to frame me maybe a scale or something that you can

29
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.260
judge me by a five, 10.

30
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.170
One is like.

31
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.500
<v 0>One is like, you know, I watch a tackle on time to my hero academia.</v>

32
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.860
Like just like just getting started all. And 10 is like,

33
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.880
I look at an anime and I know exactly who the Ganga artists for this is.

34
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.200
<v 1>That. What are you on that scale? Where would you put yourself? Actually,</v>

35
00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:55.310
then this one might help me. I would put myself as a seven or nine,

36
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.870
probably. Like, I probably would've been like a five,

37
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.570
but now it's pretty like a full free, honestly,

38
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.380
but it's pretty cut and put it gone down to a three. And a recently has,

39
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.760
has like yours has.

40
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.460
<v 0>Do you, do you feel like you've become less of an anime fan,</v>

41
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.610
like more recently and have you like fallen out with the culture ever since you

42
00:02:13.611 --> 00:02:14.444
moved here?

43
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.340
<v 1>I guess, I guess because.</v>

44
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.390
<v 0>I mean, it's not like you don't watch anime, right? Like you still keep up.</v>

45
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.523
Like.

46
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.840
<v 1>I love our attacker cult show. I love like the community in general, but, um,</v>

47
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.100
I think just when you get so deep into it, if we start like in the community,

48
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.881
I just started like,

49
00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:34.820
not enjoy the community when it got into a point where I was getting really

50
00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.550
deep. And everyone's like your name, your favorite Kiana Meda. And I was like,

51
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.150
what? I like the show and the story. I'm going to care about that.

52
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.660
<v 0>Like, you know, we can argue that God and I probably at that point too,</v>

53
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.030
but if someone came up to me and said, name your favorite Kiana mate,

54
00:02:47.031 --> 00:02:47.864
I'll be like.

55
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.750
<v 1>No, I think there was just a lot of like, at least when I was,</v>

56
00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:52.640
I don't know if it's still going on. I mean, you guys can tell me,

57
00:02:52.641 --> 00:02:53.600
but then when I was getting,

58
00:02:53.601 --> 00:02:56.180
trying to get really deep into it and I really wanted to learn more about it,

59
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.490
it got very like gatekeeping at a point. Yeah.

60
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.070
It definitely it's being like that. It's been like.

61
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.903
<v 0>That for awhile.</v>

62
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.230
<v 1>I just started to like, not really enjoy it. And then I realized,</v>

63
00:03:04.231 --> 00:03:07.380
I think I just enjoy, I enjoy these shows way more when I'm just casual.

64
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.790
<v 0>I mean, I just kinda to,</v>

65
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.060
I just kinda learned to appreciate it more and kind of get deeper into it

66
00:03:12.061 --> 00:03:15.720
without really interacting with the community around it. I'd say. Yeah. Well,

67
00:03:15.721 --> 00:03:16.554
I guess.

68
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.230
<v 1>I think me included when I get into something,</v>

69
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.500
the one thing that I will always do is just like, look at the community for it.

70
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.070
All right. What's the norms. What,

71
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:26.040
what should I get into what's everyone saying like the best thing,

72
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.320
because that's a way of like guiding your, like,

73
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.290
it's like a tailored experience of like what everyone thinks of the best way of

74
00:03:31.291 --> 00:03:32.124
enjoying something.

75
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.340
<v 0>Cause, cause I feel like you don't really follow seasonal anime anymore. Right?</v>

76
00:03:35.341 --> 00:03:38.250
You just kind of wait to see what everyone's talking about and what's worth

77
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.350
watching. Like how would you decide what animated, what?

78
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.420
<v 1>But I think that's because like the seasonal experience of viewing animates kind</v>

79
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.450
of like died almost like, I don't think so.

80
00:03:48.451 --> 00:03:52.500
I don't think people nearly talk about seasonal anime in a week by week way.

81
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.393
Like they used to.

82
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:54.691
<v 0>I disagree.</v>

83
00:03:54.691 --> 00:03:59.400
I just think it's because last year was like so dry for seasonal anime, um,

84
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.470
that there was just nothing for people to talk.

85
00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:03.180
It was just a lot of mid shows last year.

86
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.321
<v 1>I just feel like now,</v>

87
00:04:04.321 --> 00:04:06.810
especially with like Netflix coming and releasing the episodes in,

88
00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:09.840
like everyone is like, it's not, you know,

89
00:04:09.841 --> 00:04:12.090
did you watch the latest episode of be stars? Did you watch the stars?

90
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.960
<v 0>Like, you know, that's like one out of every hundred animals.</v>

91
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.840
<v 1>I feel like everyone asks that now. It's not.</v>

92
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.670
Did you watch the newest episode itself? It's D.

93
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.450
<v 0>Well, I would say like, Oh, you watch, like, people are still asking.</v>

94
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.580
Are you watching the newest episode of attack on Titan?

95
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.250
<v 1>Are you watching attack on Titan? Are you watching the newest episode?</v>

96
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.200
<v 0>Literally every stream I do. There's always</v>

97
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.123
[inaudible]. It's like, have you watched this item app?

98
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.860
<v 1>And it's different than talking, talking. There's not a ton of time.</v>

99
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.210
Like any seasonal enemy? No,

100
00:04:39.211 --> 00:04:41.100
normally I never get seasonal and I have to ask him, you know,

101
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.030
I get that all the time. No one gives a. If I was watching, like, or I'm on,

102
00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:48.180
what is that? Was it all right? What's it called? What's it

103
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.370
[inaudible] generic feels good. Anyway, that's an eight season, you know? Like,

104
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.410
are you watching that? No one asks me, it. I'm gonna ask him that.

105
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.770
If I'm watching that, no one asks me for watch decadence. You know what I mean?

106
00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:07.920
Like no one gives a because there's so many enemies that are so mid now

107
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.880
somebody's.

108
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.130
<v 0>Coming out. I tried watching there's so.</v>

109
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.670
<v 1>Many animals that are coming out. That the only ones people I seem to have that,</v>

110
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.080
cause it used to be again,

111
00:05:16.081 --> 00:05:18.840
when there's a lot less animate as well that everyone could kind of ask,

112
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.640
are you watching these shows? Are you watching it weekly?

113
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.210
And now it's just so many. And we have so many like good shows,

114
00:05:24.211 --> 00:05:26.970
but like we only really, I find in my experience at general,

115
00:05:26.971 --> 00:05:30.450
Twitter only really asked if you're watching a show weekly now or keeps up with

116
00:05:30.451 --> 00:05:32.130
the hype if it's a big event like that.

117
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.100
<v 0>Right, right. Right. Because I feel it was missing last year.</v>

118
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:38.370
Was that big event. Cause last year we had something like the demon Slayer,

119
00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:40.230
that demon slate episode that really like.

120
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.850
<v 1>And then I never saw like week by week place by demon slammed people by week.</v>

121
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.150
I was like, yo demon epididymus lamps are 17.

122
00:05:48.151 --> 00:05:49.860
Boys will be all saying what we we'll say on Twitter. You know?

123
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.460
Don't like any of that, it was just an episode. 19 was amazing. It gave the,

124
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.820
both of my children, Jesus Christ, his re reborn, like that's what happened.

125
00:05:56.821 --> 00:05:57.980
Right. And that was it. Like,

126
00:05:57.981 --> 00:06:01.190
there wasn't anything else other than like demon Slayer. Good. Right.

127
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.610
That was there. I feel like, do you not think that's kind of like gut check?

128
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.610
It's shifted a little. I I'm. I am I seeing, I think.

129
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.280
<v 0>Maybe it's just shifted just because you've kind of shifted away from it.</v>

130
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.930
Cause I've also shifted away from it too.

131
00:06:13.931 --> 00:06:15.710
And I've definitely noticed like the lack of,

132
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.090
I do feel like that's so many people, cause I know so many people now who,

133
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.110
like they say, they're anime fans a hundred percent. And the, the,

134
00:06:26.111 --> 00:06:30.820
the, all they do is read manga what? Vici tubers and play Gacha games. Wow.

135
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.050
<v 1>I mean this photo</v>

136
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:40.360
[inaudible] I never seen him talking about episode three of this.

137
00:06:40.361 --> 00:06:42.070
It's always chapter this of this Munger.

138
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.110
Cause everyone knows that they're released at this point.

139
00:06:44.111 --> 00:06:47.170
And then everyone keeps up with it on Twitter. But I never see it for,

140
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.930
for anime. No one does anime episode reviews anymore.

141
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.290
Except for like big shows or [inaudible] everyone does Monga chapters,

142
00:06:53.291 --> 00:06:57.250
things still that's so popular. I mean, I genuinely think it shifted.

143
00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.000
I don't think I'm the weird one here. I can't see the truth. What's happening.

144
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.090
<v 0>I disagree with like, no one does episode reviews anymore.</v>

145
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.050
Cause there's still like,

146
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.630
there's still like a big group of YouTubers who still do it.

147
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.240
<v 1>Oh really? You watch episode reviewers name. Every episode of your writing</v>

148
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.050
[inaudible] will be taken down and chippy will still be making reviews.

149
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.660
I don't know who like, come on. That doesn't count, man.

150
00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.020
<v 0>Well, no, that's literally, that's the only one that matters in my opinion,</v>

151
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.480
I guess. I mean, I,

152
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.470
I feel like that kind of mirrors the culture now because

153
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:34.270
I feel like definitely at being an animated YouTuber last year was hard.

154
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.910
Um, anime contents last year was like for, from my perspective,

155
00:07:39.911 --> 00:07:41.890
animate content on YouTube just didn't do as well.

156
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.640
There's no one was watching any anime videos around anime culture.

157
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.310
Like what you guys were doing. You guys, you fight,

158
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.380
you guys killed it last year, in my opinion.

159
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.450
And I feel like that's because nobody,

160
00:07:52.451 --> 00:07:55.420
nobody like people care less about individual shows now.

161
00:07:55.421 --> 00:07:57.190
And people just more care about culture.

162
00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.930
I think the last time I did a show or a video on a show that was like seasonal

163
00:08:01.931 --> 00:08:06.460
and ongoing was promise Neverland. And that was like, what? Two years ago?

164
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:07.370
Three years ago. It.

165
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:09.610
<v 1>Banana fish amazing.</v>

166
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.580
<v 0>It was like two, three years ago. Right. And it's like, since then,</v>

167
00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:15.610
it's just like every season comes around and I do, what will I be watching?

168
00:08:15.611 --> 00:08:16.960
And then I look at the list and I was like.

169
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.880
<v 1>Like Joey used to change the tile that I lied to you for 20 minutes</v>

170
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.820
while I'm looking at the comments of finally called you out of their

171
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:29.380
lighters.

172
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.920
<v 0>Yeah, of course. No, th that, that series now is just a quick,</v>

173
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.500
easy way of being like, Oh, let's see what Joey thinks about this.

174
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.850
We know he's not going to watch it,

175
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.700
but at least we'll know what he feels about it. But for me,

176
00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:43.420
seasonal anime has just become this glorified Mongo recommendation system.

177
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.090
<v 1>Where if, if, if, if I find.</v>

178
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.100
<v 0>A series like this, it's so good.</v>

179
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.500
<v 1>This is what like shopping is to Amazon.</v>

180
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.540
I go to the store to go and buy it on Amazon.
