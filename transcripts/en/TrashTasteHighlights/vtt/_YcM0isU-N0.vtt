00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.110
<v 0>But, uh, moving on, uh, let's go over to Connor's list, which is rather.</v>

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.060
<v 1>Would be a first please. So do you want to cry when I think I need to</v>

3
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.530
now take bullying from you guys every week.

4
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.770
I need alcohol from the,

5
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.880
the show to kind of fence off two boys a week. What do you mean?

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.710
We've both gone so much from you because every weekend Kotter has to

7
00:00:24.711 --> 00:00:28.880
defend his take. Well, I mean, it's kind of hard because.

8
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.160
<v 0>I'm looking at this list right now and so far,</v>

9
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.290
there's a lot of shows that you haven't even given us.

10
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.930
<v 1>Cool. Yeah. I think there's a lot of them. I'm just like, this is so.</v>

11
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.670
I don't even want to give it a like, hold up.

12
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.830
Don't tell me anything until I've had my beer.

13
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.860
<v 0>Okay. No, no, no. We're starting now. We're starting now.</v>

14
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.780
You better prepare your anus here. Like. No, an eight.

15
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.700
<v 1>Hey, the bucket. No Stan gave bucket in the States.</v>

16
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.350
Joey you'll taste the at the top is so much better. Yeah.

17
00:00:56.351 --> 00:00:59.480
I don't know why I did that. I mean, you know, clearly I was a fool.

18
00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:00.440
I don't know who that person is.

19
00:01:00.441 --> 00:01:04.160
Who signed into my account and changed my school. I love the. They gave buck.

20
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.290
<v 0>Him on a Guthrie, a highest score than pocket knife.</v>

21
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.190
<v 1>Clean it off. The story of 10 is on.</v>

22
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.320
<v 0>Me for liking climate. Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.040
<v 1>The first season is. What do I give that? Give it a score.</v>

24
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.520
It's so forgettable. I didn't even want to write that.

25
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.510
Show bits. If I could write that I did that like a seven or an eight.

26
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.030
That was a fun show. Yeah, that was great. That's a fun show. Okay.

27
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.840
Why the did I give see the money of the soul? Impossible control and eight

28
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.910
[inaudible].

29
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.530
<v 0>Never even finished that. Okay. Kochia sees them one and two. The same score.</v>

30
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.720
Wait, did I really? Yeah. You did. Second thing.

31
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.240
I immediately noticed after our discussion,

32
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.850
like we just had Pokemon for.

33
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.110
<v 1>[Inaudible] probably explain why that is the case. Right?</v>

34
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.860
Because this was made in 2014. It was probably the age of like,

35
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.590
I'm a big boy now pick one, pick one.

36
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.270
That's old con that's child caught of me. Adult Connor. I don't like Pokemon.

37
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.220
I'm a man. I thought you were my boy. No, I am.

38
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.730
I wish I would actively change that to a 10 if I could.

39
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.360
<v 0>Really 10. Okay. One, one thing. I, one thing I find hilarious.</v>

40
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.260
<v 1>Right. But come on because I can't be,</v>

41
00:02:24.261 --> 00:02:25.670
I have to talk about scores.

42
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.050
<v 0>No, my own Connor has given steins Gates and sought out online.</v>

43
00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:32.360
The same score of eight.

44
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.123
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.780
[inaudible].

46
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.340
<v 0>Well, not in line season one. And.</v>

47
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.190
<v 1>Joe is just having an aneurysm. Right? Listen, I can explain you.</v>

48
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.320
Keep it the same. Please explain it.

49
00:02:54.321 --> 00:02:55.154
Okay.

50
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.530
<v 0>Question you giving stains. Get an eight. Okay. That's fine. I meant to 10.</v>

51
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.970
<v 1>[Inaudible]. I almost think, you know, what, if I had genuine, I</v>

52
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.970
, I enjoyed soda online, but if I went back and watched it, I'm sure. You know, I would be like, what the is this? But I enjoyed it for 

53
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.970
like what it was. I liked the idea. Cause it's

54
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.970
 my first ever like video game anime. Right

55
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.970
, right. So it was fun. And then, you know, you think about it more and then you

56
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.970
 think about Carytown and you're like, wow. Really Gabi. But at the

57
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:07.803
 time, yeah. I mean, at the time everyone everyone's.

58
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.720
<v 0>We've all gone through the stage where we thought saw us in line was a cool</v>

59
00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:40.380
concept. Whack. Back when it was a cool concept, admittedly,

60
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.470
as much as I'm known as the guy who publicly hates, sold online,

61
00:03:43.471 --> 00:03:46.290
like I I've said that like first couple of episodes,

62
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.450
really great buildup of the premise.

63
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.350
And then it kind of just fell apart after a while when they were like,

64
00:03:52.351 --> 00:03:54.990
let's make Kirito the edgiest protagonist alive.

65
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.970
And then that's when I was like, okay.

66
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.583
<v 1>I mean.</v>

67
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.160
<v 0>You had a great premise and you just kind of ruined it with the worst,</v>

68
00:04:02.161 --> 00:04:02.880
main character.

69
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.460
<v 1>I have no idea why I gave back. And when I got three at nine, I would never,</v>

70
00:04:05.461 --> 00:04:09.840
ever do that. Why would you give it like a five? Why boring shirt?

71
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.560
That's boring, man. That's so boring. Yeah. But you have to understand,

72
00:04:13.561 --> 00:04:18.480
this is a man who skipped story. What I want to know is how the do you watch?

73
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.260
Why did you even watch it? You watched an animated light, novel.

74
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.260
Gotcha. And then I watched like the next three seasons or so.

75
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.440
And how did you manage that? How did you manage that?

76
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.760
I'm just confused a lot of the time,

77
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.640
but I also just like thought a lot of it was weird. Like, cause this is the,

78
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:36.331
you have to bear in mind.

79
00:04:36.331 --> 00:04:38.610
This is the first time I'd ever seen any anime where like there was a

80
00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:41.820
protagonist or whatever. He was just like touching a kid, like the ghost skills.

81
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.860
And I was like, I was like, Whoa, what the? What the is this? I'm like, well,

82
00:04:46.861 --> 00:04:49.650
why is he want like in this child porn bro. It's all right, man.

83
00:04:49.651 --> 00:04:51.220
It's a deconstruction of heroin.

84
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.330
What I want to know is how you got the patients to do it because even me, well,

85
00:04:57.331 --> 00:04:59.760
you bet again, back in the age of like when you're an anime fan,

86
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.330
you can kind of like put up with anything because you've just gotten into it.

87
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:04.620
Yeah. And that was when I watched it.

88
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.550
Cause it always high up on the list and that,

89
00:05:06.551 --> 00:05:08.850
that might've been the thing that made me be like, you know what, no,

90
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.953
I'm not watching it. Now.

91
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.911
<v 0>He uses me. Right.</v>

92
00:05:11.911 --> 00:05:16.500
Is that like you gave [inaudible] and I would assume the majority of them will

93
00:05:16.501 --> 00:05:20.490
have Atari series, like a mid school. Yeah. But you love cuts on a Godfrey.

94
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.770
<v 1>Catatonic Godfrey. He's like awesome. But it's.</v>

95
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.280
<v 0>The same style. It's the same style.</v>

96
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.470
<v 1>It's done like a million times better. It's so much more entertaining.</v>

97
00:05:31.471 --> 00:05:32.820
The back of what I got, she ever was.

98
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.840
<v 0>I'm not saying cuts on the gutter is bad or anything. Yeah. They're both.</v>

99
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.490
<v 1>Great. Because like, I guess in my mind, when I think of like on, I got that,</v>

100
00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.370
it just feels like a Quentin Tarantino film. Like when I like,

101
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.700
like the dialogue is really important. It's like the one that like,

102
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.470
I don't really like it when seeing,

103
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.050
how did you not find that with the Mormon Atari series?

104
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.450
Because I didn't find the dialogue interesting in like Catan,

105
00:05:54.451 --> 00:05:58.070
I got through like the one selling point. Find it.

106
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.903
<v 0>Interesting.</v>

107
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.240
<v 1>I was just waiting. I, you know,</v>

108
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.850
I was sold and rice circulation came on and I'm like, yo, this is.

109
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.840
<v 0>I went to see her man and give, give us the water. Yeah.</v>

110
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.390
I needed after I needed, after the aneurysm, I'm happy.

111
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.320
<v 1>And I got three, right. Was like legit. Oh. Okay. I made my three by three.</v>

112
00:06:14.321 --> 00:06:16.400
I'll see, I didn't put the catatonic. I thought again,

113
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:17.620
because I just didn't forgot it existed,

114
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.980
but that would go with my three by three. So ketonic Guthrie is like,

115
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.320
it gave me everything that like I love about like kill bill and pulp fiction in

116
00:06:26.321 --> 00:06:30.910
anime foam kind of store with a setting that I love, which is like samurai.

117
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:31.810
I love samurai.

118
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.101
<v 0>I mean, again,</v>

119
00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:35.900
I'm not disagreeing with you on that a hundred percent agree with all of them.

120
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.730
Yeah. I'm just saying like, it's, it's both a lot of words. It's both,

121
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.010
it's both weird. Yeah. It's both characters. That's very serious shaft, no cuts.

122
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.300
And I got to his North studio shaft.

123
00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.060
<v 1>And I got three. I just really enjoyed so much more than I ever did.</v>

124
00:06:52.061 --> 00:06:53.020
The monograph series.

125
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.290
<v 0>That's the closest you've come to enjoying just reading words then. Yeah.</v>

126
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.490
<v 1>There's a lot of the action was really good.</v>

127
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.830
Three and it made sense on the story.

128
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.810
<v 0>Action in the morning. I'm sorry. I'm going to Guthrie.</v>

129
00:07:04.811 --> 00:07:09.310
Serious action was insane. Come on man. It's I don't know why,

130
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.940
but yet the action was far better than I had any rights. Yeah, exactly.

131
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.060
Sharp was like, all right, I'm gonna flex real quick. Like that,

132
00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:19.300
that fight where it was like [inaudible] versus like,

133
00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:20.980
I think it was Karen in the second season.

134
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.290
It was like the big brother versus I can't even remember. No,

135
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:28.180
the fight was a combo. Yeah. You remember the monkeys?

136
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.740
That was brutal, man. I don't even find, remember this.

137
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.380
I'll show you afterwards and you'll, you'll learn to appreciate it.

138
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:35.921
<v 1>Let's say though,</v>

139
00:07:35.921 --> 00:07:38.680
the toothbrushing is part of the thing that made me like curious about hen Thai.

140
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.270
I was like, Oh, this is actually.

141
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.770
<v 0>Kind of honestly like the toothbrush scene. I'm gonna say it's hot.</v>

142
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:49.180
I feel like it birthed so many degenerates because that us culture was born.

143
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.410
Dust culture was born. Thanks to the toothbrushing. That is a classic scene.

144
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.970
And that scene as being like the classic scene, um,

145
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.440
I noticed you gave Nora gummy a 10. Did I remaster people?

146
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.560
Who are you and how much time did you spend on Tumblr?

147
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:11.020
<v 1>Honestly, I don't know what mindset I was in. There was,</v>

148
00:08:11.021 --> 00:08:13.490
I don't think there's any point in my life where I genuinely liked.

149
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.960
<v 0>In my opinion, the only 10 out of 10 aspect about an origami is the opening.</v>

150
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.040
Yeah, that was good.
