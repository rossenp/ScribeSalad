00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.250
<v 0>I think if you asked me, would I rather be, you know,</v>

2
00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.820
interrogated in Guantanamo Bay or have a girlfriend who's obsessed with Disney

3
00:00:05.821 --> 00:00:07.470
or kingdom hearts? I think I'd take one time.

4
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.870
I think I'd have more chance of staying sane.

5
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.610
I cannot stand girls who always just want to watch Disney movies. It drives me.

6
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.180
<v 1>That's like 90%. Nah, honestly. I'm sorry for you, Joey.</v>

7
00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:23.570
That's my class. My nightmare as well. I guess I thought I was going to hate it,

8
00:00:23.571 --> 00:00:25.880
but then again, I've seen so few Disney movies.

9
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.540
<v 0>Because understandably I'm so I'm so glad that girls are moving away from that</v>

10
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:32.580
and getting into true crime. I can get behind girls wanting to watch.

11
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.390
<v 1>No, if anything, I would rather watch Disney movies than true crime. No, no,</v>

12
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.280
no. I would have to go with the true crime,

13
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.590
but I don't understand hockey every morning.

14
00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:44.780
I wake up to some kind of police interrogation.

15
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.050
[inaudible] it's a rapist today, honey, every time he's just like,

16
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.370
so why don't you do it? Why I don't want to,

17
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.460
I don't want to wake up to this it's that criminal psychology channel, right?

18
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.920
That I swear every gun is watching now.

19
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.530
<v 0>Jim can't swim psychology. Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.470
Many of them there's so many channels like that. And I'm just like, I,

21
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.830
cause I watched the, the,

22
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.460
the gym concert psychology and then my recommended was just,

23
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.520
it's like the new reaction to YouTube is the overreacting to interrogation.

24
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.220
<v 1>And I'm like, what is happening? Why are we reacting to interrogation? Like,</v>

25
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.620
like I get it because you watch it and you feel,

26
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.020
you almost feel physically suffocated. Right?

27
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.500
Because I remember watching some of these videos and you feel what?

28
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:29.870
You feel like a kid again, where you, you like,

29
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.530
you'd like stole a cookie and your mom's like, did you steal a cookie?

30
00:01:33.531 --> 00:01:36.660
And you're just like, Oh, what do I say? What do I say? And it's it's,

31
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.250
it's like that simulator without being back in that

32
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.380
have like.

33
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.360
<v 0>They have the thing, they'll pause the interrogation and be like,</v>

34
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.310
this is the backward. Suplex a mental gymnastic move. And I'm like, I love it.

35
00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:50.540
When my mother used to do that one to me.

36
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.480
<v 1>Were like, this is the ultra Rigo sufficing.</v>

37
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.420
<v 0>Technique. And I'm like, loved it when my dad did that to me, that's a classic.</v>

38
00:01:56.421 --> 00:01:57.290
I love that one. Yeah.

39
00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.900
<v 1>Yeah. It's like, it's like being back in school, you know,</v>

40
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.550
getting told off for detention.

41
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.810
<v 0>It'd be like, we have proof and they wouldn't say the proof. And I'm like,</v>

42
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.420
this is like the big mind game of school. Like we know you did it. I'm like.

43
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.390
<v 1>Yeah. And then they would go, we don't need to show it.</v>

44
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.500
Just know that we have

45
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.650
their pants and just seeing like good cop,

46
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.800
bad cop in action and seeing it actually work. And it's just, yeah.

47
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.360
It's it's it's I can see how you can fall down that rabbit hole and become

48
00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:32.270
addictive. It's interesting. Don't get me wrong.

49
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.750
But every day I honestly,

50
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:37.550
I could put a watch every morning.

51
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.100
I couldn't do it because I was not something I want to watch.

52
00:02:40.101 --> 00:02:40.910
First thing in the morning.

53
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.570
<v 0>I would rather watch a mediocre documentary over a good movie.</v>

54
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.890
<v 1>That's that's you, you have programmed your brain wrong.</v>

55
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.520
I like you literally have programmed your brain. What that does.

56
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.060
<v 0>It does make sense. I just like real life stuff. Way more than like,</v>

57
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.120
I don't know why I've somehow gotten into it where I just really enjoy like,

58
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.090
but.

59
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.780
<v 1>Like here's the thing, because I've, I've,</v>

60
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.980
I've thought about this recently where I feel like a lot of people now are more

61
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.640
like,

62
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.390
will be more willing to watch something that they don't have to pay a hundred

63
00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:11.320
percent attention to.

64
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.710
So if you have like a really high quality movie or something that you,

65
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.470
that you need to like pay attention to,

66
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.310
you're less likely to watch that then say trash tastes, you know,

67
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.550
just three people Chang for two hours or like a real life documentary where

68
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.860
not every detail is important. You just get like the basic story. Right?

69
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.390
<v 0>That's fine. No, I don't know. I don't know why I'm like that. I just enjoy it.</v>

70
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.670
I'm sure there's people out there who have the same, like, cause on Netflix.

71
00:03:35.671 --> 00:03:37.380
I think all I watch is like document.

72
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.200
<v 1>You've watched. Every time I meet you, you watch a new documentary.</v>

73
00:03:40.201 --> 00:03:42.060
I have no idea where you find the time to do that.

74
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.760
I play a lot of them in the background. Yeah, that's right.

75
00:03:44.761 --> 00:03:46.650
But does that count as watching it?

76
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.900
<v 0>Some of them are, like I said, like some of them are mid,</v>

77
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.330
so it's like just put it on the background and let it do its thing.

78
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.760
<v 1>That's the one thing I've never understood is like people who say like, yeah,</v>

79
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.480
I've seen like I've watched like 500 movies. I'm like, Oh, how did you watch it?

80
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.790
I just let her play in the background while I was like cleaning the dishes.

81
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:01.561
<v 0>John is watching the movie.</v>

82
00:04:01.561 --> 00:04:04.830
I'm like typing out while I'm it's in my peripheral and I'm listening to it.

83
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:05.220
Yeah.

84
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.490
<v 1>I dunno. I don't really count that as watching it off. That's watching.</v>

85
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:09.930
I can't concentrate on it,

86
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.350
but you couldn't do that to something like pulp fiction.

87
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.650
<v 0>No, that's why I would never treat it like that. Yeah, exactly.</v>

88
00:04:16.651 --> 00:04:17.484
I'm there with anime.

89
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.890
<v 1>And, and I feel like doing that,</v>

90
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.650
I've realized that because I've been doing that more often with YouTube videos

91
00:04:22.651 --> 00:04:23.010
as well,

92
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.450
and I've found it harder and harder just to sit down and watch something

93
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.930
like it's do, do you find that like watching watch,

94
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.090
unless it's like a super engaging show,

95
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.790
like watching any standard show now it's just,

96
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.800
it's just 10 times harder because you just want to,

97
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.920
you kind of just want to skip to where the important plot points are.

98
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.900
<v 0>Sometimes. I mean,</v>

99
00:04:42.901 --> 00:04:44.970
I've been watching some pretty good shows recently that I haven't really had

100
00:04:44.971 --> 00:04:46.920
trouble with, but yeah. Sometimes I have that problem.

101
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.960
<v 1>I'm glad I've never subjected myself to that.</v>

102
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.000
Cause otherwise I'd probably be feeling the same pain,

103
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.650
but I don't put something on unless I have the full intent of putting a hundred

104
00:04:55.651 --> 00:04:58.350
percent of my concentration into it. Oh man. Cause I, I don't know,

105
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.310
like I don't see the point of like working on something while something else is

106
00:05:02.311 --> 00:05:03.150
playing in the background.

107
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.340
Cause then I'm just going to get distracted by whatever is playing.

108
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.630
So either way I can't concentrate on watching the thing and doing whatever.

109
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.770
<v 0>I can't focus without some noise, but I need a nice musical. Yeah.</v>

110
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:15.990
I mean music old puts something on his wives.

111
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.140
<v 1>Yeah. But like, I can't have anything that's like visual on,</v>

112
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.831
you know what I mean?

113
00:05:19.831 --> 00:05:23.160
Like the last thing you put down that you properly concentrated on them.

114
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.510
Like I said, was it the boys? The boys was a good TV show. That was refunded.

115
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.200
That was, that was really good.

116
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.990
<v 0>Was about that. Yeah. Yeah. I was like,</v>

117
00:05:30.991 --> 00:05:32.850
I didn't like didn't reach out my phone or anything.

118
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.100
I was just watching it the whole time. It was really good.

119
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.601
<v 1>That's that's what,</v>

120
00:05:36.601 --> 00:05:40.960
that's the kind of experience I want whenever I watch something I I'm kinda

121
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:41.430
like,

122
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.700
cause I've been noticing I've been getting so distracted recently when watching

123
00:05:44.701 --> 00:05:45.534
stuff that I just,

124
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.430
I enjoy it less and I missed the enjoyment I had when I guess I was a kid and

125
00:05:50.431 --> 00:05:53.490
one of those people who like can't be watching something unless they have like

126
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.100
their phone in their hand. I didn't used to be like that.

127
00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.460
I've slowly become that person and doing that on an amaze

128
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:02.870
hard mode man, because,

129
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.210
I couldn't read the subtitles and my goddess,

130
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:11.450
like trying to watch Mani when you're eating, when you're eating something.

131
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:15.140
Right. Like it's, it's, it's so difficult. I wait, I missed the one second.

132
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.200
The dialogue that was important because that the crunching sounds in my ears.
