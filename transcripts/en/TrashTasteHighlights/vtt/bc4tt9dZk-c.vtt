00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.420
<v 0>Well, I went through a period in life where, you know,</v>

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.690
I was the stereotypical Wiebe that didn't go out and I have zero social skills.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.410
And how I learned was I think everyone goes through that stage,

4
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:12.360
especially if you go through your university where you kind of want to,

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.500
you kind of want to reinvent yourself, right.

6
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.220
You move it to someone new and you want to be a new person.

7
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:22.050
So what I did was I basically just had like a full year where I just

8
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.280
went out as much as possible and talk to as many people as possible,

9
00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:27.840
just like try to go out of my comfort zone.

10
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.470
And that was hell for me as like this introvert, it was kind of like,

11
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.470
it's kind of like a trial by fire period of my life that I would never want to

12
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:34.910
do. Guess.

13
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.450
<v 1>300 Spot trainings.</v>

14
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.540
<v 2>Basically was cause I, I literally, I literally just did not.</v>

15
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.610
<v 0>Not socialized. I didn't know how to read a room.</v>

16
00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:44.600
I didn't know what the social norms.

17
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.950
<v 3>That's like such a common,</v>

18
00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:49.250
like cultural thing in Japan that we actually have like our own like phrase for

19
00:00:49.251 --> 00:00:52.970
it, which is university debut. No, really? It's like a,

20
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.730
it's like a cultural thing in Japan where like, because there are so many,

21
00:00:55.731 --> 00:01:00.110
like anti-social kids in middle school and high school and that when they go

22
00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:01.280
into university, they're like, Oh.

23
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.510
I'm like one step closer to where I have to socialize in order to

24
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.930
live in society. So universities,

25
00:01:08.931 --> 00:01:11.840
literally my last chance before I'm thrown into that world.

26
00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:16.010
So I'm going to like make a one 80 during university and just do anything and

27
00:01:16.011 --> 00:01:18.920
everything possible to just completely change myself around, I think.

28
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.500
<v 1>Oh, P mindset when you, when you, you know,</v>

29
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.360
cause I wasn't cool at all in school,

30
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.660
I was average like very much an in-betweener, you know, I wasn't. Yeah,

31
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.690
but I wasn't like, I wasn't like on the bottom of the social ladder,

32
00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:33.110
if you will like bullied to. Right? I mean that's cause I started fighting back.

33
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.730
I just thought my way out, you know, I was just kinda like whatever,

34
00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:40.400
like no one really paid attention to me. Never had any luck with like, you know,

35
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:44.330
dating or anything. I never had any of that. But then I thought like, Oh wait,

36
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.490
like no one knows who I am in university. So like, I don't know.

37
00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:51.830
No one knows I'm a mid tier social. I'm a,

38
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.480
I'm a CTO on the social ladder. I can, I can reinvent myself.

39
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.150
And I think I didn't, you know, I didn't reinvent myself. It's just like,

40
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.100
you don't do the mistakes and you don't fall back on crutches that you had like,

41
00:02:03.101 --> 00:02:05.780
like don't, like you said, right. You go out more, you don't, you know,

42
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.300
I could play video games, which I probably would prefer doing.

43
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.940
But if people invite me out, I'll say yes, because you want to be seen.

44
00:02:10.941 --> 00:02:13.330
It was fun. It was fun. Everything goes easier and you learn more,

45
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.850
you get more confident. If for me it was a comfort zone for me, it was like.

46
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.260
<v 3>The complete opposite.</v>

47
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.110
I was like the really social in middle school and high school.

48
00:02:21.111 --> 00:02:23.600
And then when I entered university, because I started doing YouTube. Yeah.

49
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.680
<v 1>I like kind of regressed, which socially also lived at home. Right. Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:30.140
I lifted, I can imagine that's like Wade, you must feel,

51
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.720
did you feel like different from like the other people who were living on campus.

52
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.430
<v 2>A little bit. I mean.</v>

53
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.570
<v 3>Al campus was weird because I think the majority of people in my class did live</v>

54
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:39.770
at home. Oh wow. Yeah.

55
00:02:39.771 --> 00:02:43.760
We only had maybe like a handful of people who actually lived on campus.

56
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.180
<v 0>Which, uh, which, which university did you go to again? Uh, Sydney university.</v>

57
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.490
So I guess it's because it's a city university. Yeah.

58
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.520
<v 3>Have I run campus and like dormitories and stuff like that,</v>

59
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.850
that uni students live in. But I think the majority of people,

60
00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:58.940
because it's such a, uh, an accessible university,

61
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.110
it's like smack bang in the middle of like Sydney, like city.

62
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.080
So people can just like get on trains and buses and just go home.

63
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.970
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.680
Because I feel like no one in my class who lived locally to the area really well

65
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:11.663
that's because.

66
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.910
<v 0>Swanzey right. And what is there to do in Swanzey? Wow. That's.</v>

67
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.340
<v 1>A good question. I'm still wondering that myself.</v>

68
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.883
<v 0>[Inaudible] to be fair.</v>

69
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.360
<v 3>I didn't live locally. I though I live like an hour and a half by bus,</v>

70
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.900
so I didn't live close at all. I could have, like, I was at a distance way.

71
00:03:27.901 --> 00:03:29.400
I could have easily lived on the dorm,

72
00:03:29.401 --> 00:03:33.270
but then I heard from people who were living in dorms, Edison university,

73
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.830
they were like, don't do it. That's a good experience.

74
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.540
Then being thrown into hell.

75
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.401
<v 0>Honestly, I,</v>

76
00:03:37.401 --> 00:03:42.120
I feel like I learned more valuable social skills and just life

77
00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:46.740
skills going to university than I did actual career skills that I was

78
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.990
using. That, that I learned from my course.

79
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.470
<v 1>And I realized it until I left. And then I actually started like functioning.</v>

80
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:53.990
Yeah. On my own. Yeah.

81
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.870
<v 0>I don't know what I would have done without that period in my life. Jesus,</v>

82
00:03:57.871 --> 00:03:58.350
that like,

83
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.270
it basically taught me how to survive in the world and how people really

84
00:04:03.271 --> 00:04:07.350
are and all the expectations I had growing up and like, cause,

85
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.310
cause I was a kid. Right.

86
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.300
You kind of expect that as you grow up and the more mature you get,

87
00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:16.560
you assume that everyone's just going to realize what they're doing, get mature.

88
00:04:16.561 --> 00:04:19.200
And then you kind of realize, um, going through university,

89
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.500
especially that that was a lie. And then you go out of university,

90
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.170
start like the working world and you realize, Oh,

91
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.230
everyone here is just like growing up university students and everyone,

92
00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.120
nobody actually knows what they're doing.

93
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.890
And everyone is still secretly as immature adults. Aren't as adult,

94
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.590
as I thought they were right now. I don't know.

95
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.380
I feel like I don't it's either like people would just have their together.

96
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.540
<v 1>Or they don't like it. There's no in between like, I don't know.</v>

97
00:04:42.541 --> 00:04:43.374
I've never met anyone. Yeah.

98
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.650
<v 3>Most adults that I've met are just like kids in suits essentially.</v>

99
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.740
<v 0>That's basically the best way I can describe it.</v>
