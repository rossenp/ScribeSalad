1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.210
<v 0>Come on. Wait, it's in the same glass as well.</v>

2
00:00:02.211 --> 00:00:06.330
It's contaminated with the that you bought wine. And Chris made me do.

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.080
<v 1>This disgusting abomination.</v>

4
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.140
<v 0>This is the Carlsberg of shocking, like I bet this is.</v>

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.280
<v 1>If you don't know, Carlsberg is a godawful beer. Um, they're awful. Have you,</v>

6
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.370
have you noticed that in Japan sometimes they'll have Carlsburg are calling and

7
00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:23.570
they'll be like foreign beer.

8
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.270
<v 0>And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no. I know that's not water. Basically.</v>

9
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.130
They'll be like, it's called Miller light. It's an exquisite foreign beer,

10
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.970
you know? And you're like, no, no, no, I don't what this is.

11
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.490
It's just the good stuff. Let's talk offish this the good stuff again,

12
00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:45.200
right? Like again, like, as we were saying,

13
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.380
Connor's not a soccer drinker in the same way that he's,

14
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.040
I'm not a whiskey drinker. Right. You've got wine now.

15
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.380
So I use white wine from Yamanashi when I first came.

16
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.620
<v 1>Japan, I desperately wanted to be that guy who was like, I love everything.</v>

17
00:00:57.621 --> 00:00:59.690
Japan. I'm called a sewer of Japan.

18
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.200
<v 0>You've assessed with soccer, press X to doubt. He was never like that, man.</v>

19
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.420
That was like, I can't believe you just looked at my life

20
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.180
when I wasn't with you.

21
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.600
<v 1>Yes. What drink do you want to be? Like suck it. Of course.</v>

22
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.870
<v 0>Where were you? Every time he wasn't with us. Yeah, of course.</v>

23
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.970
Because I knew that you would call me out on that.

24
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.480
If I go to a bar and I'm like, he's just like middle of light, please.

25
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.910
Don't actually like with you guys, I'm like be a policeman, but like,

26
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.880
cause I don't want to be called out. Like, cause if I'm with him.

27
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.780
<v 1>Everyone, right.</v>

28
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.500
And everyone orders beer and one person who's on their first vacation to Japan

29
00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:35.990
goes of a soccer. Actually I'd be like.

30
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.640
<v 0>Off, off. You're you're just getting too into the Japan atmosphere,</v>

31
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.440
but it tastes like.

32
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.160
There's a reason why a bottle of psyche never costs more than $20.

33
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.180
The thing I've noticed very quickly about soccer that I noticed about just

34
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.470
regular wine is that I hate soccer normally.

35
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.480
But if I have it with a good meal and like a meal that fits the Sockeye,

36
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.410
I disagree, then I love it. We've got no meal though. Yeah.

37
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.790
It took me a little longer than usual.

38
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.330
What got me to like wine was having my first red wine with a nice, to be honest.

39
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.530
<v 1>Wine goes fantastically with meals. I agree. It's not.</v>

40
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.380
<v 0>Nope. It's Nope. It's not wine. Isn't it.</v>

41
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.890
<v 1>Too strong. Well like it's overpowering. Saki is like, when you,</v>

42
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.590
when you have your steak, whatever, and you have a soccer, it's like, great.

43
00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:30.530
Now I'm just drink soccer with this steak.

44
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.540
<v 0>What do you eat it with? It's usually fish.</v>

45
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.520
<v 1>You have fish, right? Yeah. Whatever the. I don't give a.</v>

46
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.350
<v 0>There's a reason why they serve a lot of soccer. Like sushi, rice. Yeah.</v>

47
00:02:39.351 --> 00:02:44.120
But when you have it, you have this fishing debate. You have the debate.

48
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.350
Chris, help me out here.

49
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.350
Cause this is what happens when we've talked about food on the podcast,

50
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.040
that guy, we always have those heated debates about food. Like whenever,

51
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.250
whenever food's brought us up, we turned into a bunch of apes. I swear to God.

52
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.600
I like when people drink.

53
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.740
<v 1>Like hard liquor with a meal or something, I'm like, you have,</v>

54
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.400
you are immediately just like absolutely bombing your mouth.

55
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.580
<v 0>It's a wine. It's like 20%, 20% is wine.</v>

56
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.460
<v 1>What are your opinions? As the adjudicator of this argument help me.</v>

57
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.350
<v 0>Red wine is 15 to 20%. Saki is 15, 20% Lima, 20% wine Gerry.</v>

58
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.380
You think I'm a wine Somalia. There is no wine.

59
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.630
<v 1>That is 20%. That is. I've never seen that.</v>

60
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.760
<v 0>I have seen that. That's probably a wine that again. Wow,</v>

61
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.960
come on. But no, I like, I much prefer wine over Saki.

62
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.510
Um, I feel like.

63
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.790
<v 1>12 To 15% is the perfect zone.</v>

64
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.750
And anything above that starts to get like tastes like vodka, right. And

65
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.300
18%. But that still tastes like a hard alcohol, right?

66
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.760
<v 0>This is you lie. It doesn't lie. Why did that burn for you? Yes.</v>

67
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.350
18%. 18% Christian. That's not Vocus 37.5. But the thing.

68
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.600
<v 1>Is I can't distinguish the difference between that. Yeah.</v>

69
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.480
<v 0>And vodka. That is why you fail. What do you want? No, no, no, no, no.</v>

70
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.463
What's wrong here.

71
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.470
I'm not partly on your side until you have the audacity to save that for

72
00:04:10.471 --> 00:04:12.600
someone who loves food so much,

73
00:04:12.601 --> 00:04:15.420
you can tell the difference between vodka and wine.

74
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.830
<v 1>What I think is it that is strong enough where it's in the same category as a</v>

75
00:04:19.831 --> 00:04:20.664
vodka tasting.

76
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.420
<v 0>No God makes you want to die more a hundred percent.</v>

77
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.730
But Sakhi does still have the same kind of.

78
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.240
<v 1>I only have like, I drink it and I'm like, ah, immediately, um,</v>

79
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.820
where's the wine. I'm like, I drink it. And I'm like.

80
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.960
<v 0>Ooh, I can't believe what I'm hearing. You're Japanese.</v>

81
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.500
Don't eat some whale.

82
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.540
Oh, that chicken and broccoli is.

83
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.720
You're taken seriously sucky on the same level as Bucky.

84
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.660
Disgusting. Listen, they both taste like mine. I mean,

85
00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:56.820
I'm not going to down wrong.

86
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.860
<v 1>I love how we've gotten two hours into this. And we actually,</v>

87
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.850
we just drank a ton of Saki unwillingly. And now it's a mess or a podcast.

88
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.840
<v 0>Thank you, Chris. I think if you watch this episode with a bit of, bit of sock,</v>

89
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.480
it's chicken broccoli. Oh,

90
00:05:09.481 --> 00:05:14.310
D experience here. Now, now that we're on the topic of alcohol.

91
00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:18.510
Fine. Okay. Your least favorite alcohol. Is it all on the same level?

92
00:05:18.511 --> 00:05:22.800
Because anything above 20% is the same to you then? Honestly.

93
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.610
<v 1>Like in like vodka, tequila, whiskey. Okay.</v>

94
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.940
<v 0>[Inaudible] this man contradicts himself. I want, I want to be like Phoenix.</v>

95
00:05:32.941 --> 00:05:34.320
Right? Right now. Bring like

96
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.100
a contradiction in your statement.

97
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.010
<v 1>Gin. Gin actually tastes nice.</v>

98
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.090
<v 0>I'm not saying that. No,</v>

99
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.750
I'm not saying that because I'm British and that that's that's our cultural

100
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.430
expo. Are we talking like just gin on its own or like a gin and tonic? Tonic.

101
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.860
Okay. Gin and tonic is on a different level. Gin and tonic.

102
00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.160
<v 1>Person who drinks, drinks. Gin. gin straight. No, no one. Exactly.</v>

103
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.020
<v 0>Because you don't hear it. Like when you.</v>

104
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:03.190
<v 1>Vodka and Coke, what do you think? I think depressing university days.</v>

105
00:06:03.191 --> 00:06:05.830
Like I'm desperate to get drunk. Yeah. Right Chris. Yeah, exactly.

106
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.920
What is the last time you had a vodka and Coke? Chris?

107
00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.860
<v 0>I vote ketonic every week.</v>

108
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.930
Whiskey.

109
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.760
<v 1>You have straight. Right? And never like, okay. Whiskey and Coke.</v>

110
00:06:21.761 --> 00:06:22.594
Sounds like it.

111
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.210
<v 0>Great whiskey and Cokes. All right. But I mean like I, I rarely drink whiskey.</v>

112
00:06:28.211 --> 00:06:32.170
Whiskey is more of a mood setter. Whiskey is there for like you don't,

113
00:06:32.171 --> 00:06:35.410
you don't want to get drunk on whiskey. No, no. I like, I,

114
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.400
if people would get drunk on whiskey are drinking whiskey way too fast for me.

115
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.610
It's like, you can't have a drink that you just kind of like it,

116
00:06:41.611 --> 00:06:44.240
it warms you up. But either way I don't care for it. Right.

117
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.820
It's like a nightcap. Basically.

118
00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.700
<v 1>We all know the superior drink is an espresso martini.</v>

119
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.810
<v 0>Right? No,</v>

120
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.700
that's true because your body is just addicted to caffeine drinks like

121
00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.040
Chris, my coffee, eight cups of coffee every day. Wind down here.

122
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:01.863
Go on.

123
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.520
<v 1>It's tainted with second cup.</v>

124
00:07:03.521 --> 00:07:06.310
Now put it in the same disgusting cup for the people.

125
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.600
It'd be a terrible Somalia.

126
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.353
<v 0>No,</v>

127
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.720
a terrible Somalian. Somalia. You'll be a terrible Somalia.

128
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.770
Somalia, Somalia. Isn't it? Is it? Isn't it Somalia? I dunno.

129
00:07:26.771 --> 00:07:28.330
I can't smell. I don't know someone.

130
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.690
Someone French canal would not be a terrible Somalian,

131
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.290
but I get that there right now. Jordan, how is it pronounced?

132
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.760
[inaudible] that's closer to my pronunciation. Malian, Somalia,

133
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.270
Somalians watching this a fraud thing right now. Oh my God. Come on. They,

134
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.113
they notice those.

135
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.350
<v 1>Resident Frenchman who sounded closer to my pronunciation than yours.</v>

136
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.370
<v 0>What do you want? I will fight this battle to the death.</v>

137
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.590
I am known for being stubborn and I won't quit.
