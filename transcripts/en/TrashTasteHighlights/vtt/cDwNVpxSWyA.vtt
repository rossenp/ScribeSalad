12
00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:45.500
but you know, this, these are the, probably I'd say the most notable ones.

13
00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:47.180
I mean, there's obviously more like, uh, you know,

14
00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:50.600

22
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.270
knowledgeable guests or sometimes not knowledgeable guests.

23
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.380
I think when we don't have a guest, it's like, don't listen to what we say.

24
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.580
We don't know. We're talking about literally like firsthand,

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.550
like source right now.

26
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.170
Now we can get the answers at the same time as our audience.

27
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.690
I am curious if there was perhaps one scene or one show that you would recommend

28
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.600
for someone to watch to maybe experience your work the best. What would you.

29
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.140

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.980
<v 1>Now? Uh, so we, we don't count my internship.</v>

39
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.750
It will be now five years. And so I start as an in-betweener and so to

40
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.620
clean up the in-betweens and I have done just for one in

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.280

42
00:02:34.281 --> 00:02:39.080
I went to [inaudible] and the previous teacher was a graphic guy and,

46
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.863
<v 0>Let's see if we'll see.</v>

47
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.340
Cause like it's it's because your background is that your half Japanese,

48
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.700
half French. Right? So it was like,

49
00:02:55.701 --> 00:03:00.100
what made you want to start working in the anime industry? Actuary in.

50
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.900
<v 1>France, we have the, uh, the first-run first-generation in the nineties and, um,</v>

51
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.760
uh, show Crow, quarter cup Doughty. And I actually adore it.

52
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:14.320
It was a woman who bought a lot of anime and dragon board since

53
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:19.150
CR Ms when we cocoon run ma. And so when I was little,

54
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:23.530
I watched those shows and also I want often to

55
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:26.020
Japan with my mother and yeah,

56
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.580
I was used to watch a lot of animals when I was kid and I grew with

57
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.103
mangelwurzel and so, yeah,

58
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.370
I used to draw those characters when I was a liter.

59
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.540
And so I w at first I wanted to be a manga.

60
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.000
<v 0>As does everyone. I think every, every, I think every weep has had that dream.</v>

61
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.080
Once I'm in their lives, it's like, who's like,

62
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.360
who draws their first name to make characters? Like, yeah,

63
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.570
I'm on my way to be on. Let's go.

64
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.210
Why are you telling me that you've never had like a,

65
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.320
like a story or something that you've just like, fantasized about? No, never.

66
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.940
You never fantasized as a kid at all. Probably. But I finally, it was like,

67
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.190
that was like my thing. Right. I'm sharing it with other people sharing.

68
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.890
When you never had a phase where you were like, I guess,

69
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.920
like you started watching animated, like a little bit of like,

70
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.530
that's true in 16. I started watching it pretty late.

71
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.420
I think I probably didn't get that whimsical phase of, yeah, because I mean,

72
00:04:24.421 --> 00:04:26.280
how old were you when you like first? Like really,

73
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:28.380
I guess like while knowing that this is.

74
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.070
<v 1>Anime. Oh, wait, I don't remember. I sing, I sing as a shock. I had,</v>

75
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.130
it was in 98 when I watch a princess monarchy.

76
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.350
Uh, and for the same, uh, we didn't know what I'm watching,

77
00:04:43.351 --> 00:04:44.810
but it was beautiful.

78
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.210
And I was just a nine, nine, nine, nine.

79
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.830
And also when I, uh, watch Evangelian, I was just 10 or 11.

80
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.870
<v 0>How good did you understand anything? Oh, Hey, St. Mere actually saved me.</v>

81
00:05:00.871 --> 00:05:01.800
I'm glad somebody.

82
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.870
<v 1>I was understanding everything, but all is make out just early and okay.</v>

83
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.070
<v 0>That's, that's all you like understand about Ava when you're like, yeah. Right.</v>

84
00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:16.290
It's like good guys, bad guys.

85
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.190
I watched it last year and that's pretty much my understand.

86
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.920
<v 1>Yeah. I, um, the characters' was 14 and the story and I was 11.</v>

87
00:05:25.921 --> 00:05:26.850
So close enough.

88
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.780
<v 0>Yeah. True. True. It's going to be me.</v>

89
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.170
I actually have a similar story about like Ava.

90
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.000
Cause Ava is the second proper anime that I watch after discovering it was

91
00:05:39.001 --> 00:05:40.110
anime. So the first,

92
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.980
the first anime I've ever watched knowing it was an anime was narrative.

93
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.630
And how I found that was I was on a random gaming forum. And you know,

94
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.190
it was back when having animate avatars was actually cool.

95
00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.490
And I was like, Oh, well, what are these that people have?

96
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.510
They look really cool. And I found that one and one guy had this avatar.

97
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:04.960
That was the show from the show called narrow toe. And I'm like, Oh,

98
00:06:04.961 --> 00:06:08.920
this kind of looks like dragon ball, Z watch narrative. I loved it.

99
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.920
Introduced me to anime properly. Um,

100
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.220
and then I went on the same game for him and I made it like an anime thread.

101
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.980
I was like, guys, this narrative is awesome.

102
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.430
Can you guys recommend me something else to watch like narrative?

103
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.950
And some guy deadass goes,

104
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.430
you should watch evangelical totally like narrative.

105
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.090
So I went to Yvonne galleon. I was like an 11,

106
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.100
12 year old thinking he was a shown anatomy.

107
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.130
And so for like the first, I'd say half of it,

108
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.090
it could like maybe have like past as I've shown him because you

109
00:06:43.091 --> 00:06:46.150
know, Shinji, you could have still, you know, Shinji was still doing stuff.

110
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.010
And then the halfway point here, and then everyone just got sad. I'm depressed.

111
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.210
And I, my 11 year old mind was just like, why, why are people like this?

112
00:06:55.211 --> 00:06:58.390
This is, this is so stupid. This is so unrealistic.

113
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.430
I remember thinking as an 11 year old,

114
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.140
this is the sh the writing of the show is so bad because the adults don't have

115
00:07:05.141 --> 00:07:09.400
their together. Why is that? So why don't the adults have their together?

116
00:07:09.401 --> 00:07:10.540
This is so unrealistic.

117
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.600
I'm like 11 year old guy coming up to his mom being like mother,

118
00:07:13.601 --> 00:07:18.400
what is depression in this show called Eve and Gilliam.

119
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.610
And now I'm just like, Oh yeah. So adults just,

120
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.220
no adults just have their together. That's just life.
