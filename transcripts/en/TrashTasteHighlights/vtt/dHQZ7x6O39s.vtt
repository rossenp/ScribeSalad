1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.670
<v 0>So, what did you have to do at your internship? What.</v>

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.380
<v 1>Was that like? So at first they, I have a, some, uh, one,</v>

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.210
not two weeks of, uh, uh, experience of how to do a walk,

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.640
how a character's do a rotation of the head. Uh, so exercise,

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.350
it would be exercise on paper. Okay. And, uh, so I plus,

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.280
Oh, I know that, um, that I, like I said,

7
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.810
I know the Western, the business, I didn't know,

8
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.770
Japanese way, we to, uh, um, less frame, uh,

9
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.390
we did just as some key and after you do the in-betweens, but, uh,

10
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.770
I had to keep hoses and I have to clean up these key poses and do the,

11
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:44.610
in between strangers.

12
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.100
<v 0>So the, the in-between frames. So I assume as they say, right, like alienated,</v>

13
00:00:49.101 --> 00:00:50.450
right. Do you want, do you wanna explain it,

14
00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:52.310
explain key frames and you've been in between.

15
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.060
<v 1>This is one, yeah. Two, right. Four. I pinch one,</v>

16
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.360
two, but for, uh,

17
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.530
do I need some in-betweens to read maybe this DKI pose,

18
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.240
uh, in betweens, right. In betweens keyboards.

19
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.070
<v 0>And those are the in-betweens are normally not as polished as the.</v>

20
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.650
<v 1>Uh, the soldier in between. It's a,</v>

21
00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:23.570
you have to take it the two key keepers and to layer them.

22
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.570
And do you do the in-betweens then? Like that? Oh, okay.

23
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.430
<v 0>Yeah, basically like the plugin in,</v>

24
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.670
after effects that people put over the animate to make it 60 FPS,

25
00:01:31.671 --> 00:01:33.920
but someone's actually doing that themselves. Right.

26
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.550
That's why I can describe it.

27
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.350
<v 1>In Japan. We are, uh, 24 FPS, right?</v>

28
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.500
<v 0>Yeah. And then that's the in-between frames and only given to like, interns.</v>

29
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.710
<v 1>Yeah. So at first I, you know, when you start or you start has a dual Garmin,</v>

30
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.660
you said, so the guy is moving it's mean moving pictures,

31
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.360
but, uh, it's been, uh, in between in Japan.

32
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.980
And so I had done this for two weeks and after just two weeks,

33
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.940
so they put me on a productions. Oh, wow. And it was

34
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.600
wow. Uh, two weeks of exercise and the last, uh, uh,

35
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.620
two months and half, it was, uh, on the production of Lupin, the song.

36
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.990
<v 0>I thought he'd be getting coffee or something for two weeks and working on</v>

37
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.333
lupine.

38
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.931
<v 1>So I was,</v>

39
00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:28.880
it was a two to two weeks of exertion after two months and half on Lupin. Uh,

40
00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:33.590
it was, uh, uh, TV special. So a TV show and, uh,

41
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.780
yes, it was my first experience.

42
00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:39.830
And so I met a lot of famous animators,

43
00:02:39.831 --> 00:02:43.460
a lot of veterans and the staff was very nice to me.

44
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.820
It was [inaudible] uh, I just

45
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.160
[inaudible] and yeah, the stuff was very nice. There were, there was wondering,

46
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.850
Oh, why, why do you know?

47
00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.630
No in yea I to go, boy, I want to,

48
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.610
I want to walk in Japan.

49
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.240
<v 0>Yeah. Do you want, do you want to be an animator for animate, man?</v>

50
00:03:06.241 --> 00:03:10.140
I feel bad for our intern now. Like I'm, I'm sorry, Ashley,

51
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.730
like hearing the story, you know.

52
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.540
<v 1>So, and I had a Metta senpai, a French senpai who,</v>

53
00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.200
my name, uh, Krista [inaudible] and a French.

54
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:25.190
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

55
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.890
<v 1>That, uh, take a time and a walk very late.</v>

56
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.460
And peep when you walk very right. Less than two meters,

57
00:03:32.461 --> 00:03:37.080
but the bus is not here. And so anyway says are more, um,

58
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.690
uh, they are more free to speak to you.

59
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.680
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

60
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.150
<v 1>Oh, you work harder than very nice, uh, late. Uh, what are you doing?</v>

61
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.120
<v 0>I feel like that must be your bonding experience. Right?</v>

62
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.350
Cause you're staying up late.

63
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.920
<v 1>Yeah, exactly. Uh, when most of my good</v>

64
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.340
friends was because, uh, uh, yes, we walk through reacted,

65
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.470
uh, uh, eight o'clock of the morning because we work hard. We didn't slept.

66
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.600
And your brother.

67
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.240
<v 0>[Inaudible]</v>

68
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.240
, so you literally just sent an email to a company and then you flew to Japan 

69
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.240
and wow. loop literally within a month. So what timeframe

70
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.073
 was it from you sending that email to the company, to you being in Japan?

71
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.490
<v 1>Yeah. Uh, so, uh, I sent a mail in January,</v>

72
00:04:35.491 --> 00:04:38.310
they said, okay. And so I went in June.

73
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.700
<v 0>Six, six.</v>

74
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.670
<v 1>But, uh, yes, but</v>

75
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.880
I was pretty Rocky because the director said yes,

76
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.620
and now the director is not no more walking at telecom animation.

77
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.050
He's now in Thai. Uh, and yeah, so it was cool.

78
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.820
And so this was my first experience in the Japanese animation industry.

79
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.320
What was it? 10 years ago? And so I went to another,

80
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.300
an emission school and to descend emissions, Coro. I had to, uh,

81
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.970
have a dedication to do a summer school at a gobbler.

82
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.420
Uh [inaudible] it's a French famous, cool animation. And I have met, um,

83
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:23.310
uh, [inaudible], uh,

84
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.310
 he's very famous. So because he's maybe the, the pop of the French and the

85
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.310
meters in Japan. And also because he's very famous, uh,  he redrew his kids, uh,

86
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.143
 drawings. Oh, wow.

87
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.070
<v 0>Oh, that sounds familiar. Sounds very familiar.</v>

88
00:05:41.071 --> 00:05:44.100
That sounds like you blew up on the radio or something, right?

89
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.540
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.470
So he kids drew and he picked a picture of [inaudible]

91
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.333
has a professor.

92
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.550
<v 0>Yeah, that sounds, that sounds very familiar. Yeah.</v>

93
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.300
<v 1>I met him at, um, at this a summer and, uh, I,</v>

94
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.070
he gave me a, a Beto with him and he gave me uh he's um,

95
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.170
uh, he's cards, business cards, and connection is very important.

96
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.870
Like I said, uh, this summer. Cool. I could do it because I'm infected,

97
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.220
you're jerked off to recommend mission school was doing a summer school. I,

98
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.030
the gallbladder, but he needed as translator. Oh,

99
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.900
call me okay. In France as you can help me. Right. Right.

100
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.950
And that's why the first, the first way to find a contact is very difficult.

101
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.800
When you have one he can introduce to.

102
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.970
<v 0>To someone else door opens, but that's what it is with live with.</v>

103
00:06:36.971 --> 00:06:40.900
Like the enemy industry. Is that like, it's only so big. Yeah. So once you know,

104
00:06:40.901 --> 00:06:44.680
one person, yeah. It's just the hard part is getting in,

105
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.380
but everyone I've met who is working in the anime industry,

106
00:06:47.381 --> 00:06:48.610
especially if they're a foreigner,

107
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.650
they've just had like that one lucky pool of light. Yeah. Just,

108
00:06:52.651 --> 00:06:54.850
just like the one lucky in, and once they brought that here.

109
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.780
<v 1>As you animators, it's the first time it's a difficult to entry,</v>

110
00:06:58.781 --> 00:07:03.280
but after is to stay here. So let me explain, uh, later, but, uh,

111
00:07:03.281 --> 00:07:04.114
so yeah,

112
00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:09.010
so I sent a mailer to Tamara Roma and tomorrow man was walking at this time at a

113
00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:12.280
satellite. Okay. Swords are very famous, uh,

114
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.070
for the series Macross and.

115
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.870
<v 0>Innovation studio, I assume. Yeah. They,</v>

116
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.720
the log Corizon as well as season one of the seasons SU.

117
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:24.763
Yeah.

118
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.250
<v 1>And so, uh,</v>

119
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:33.130
I could manage to a four months internship, et cetera. Right. Wow. And,

120
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:38.170
but it was very different con uh,

121
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.660
it was a bit more quarter, a bit more rush.

122
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.560
Oh, hurry up, hurry up. Uh, and, uh, take them,

123
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:52.180
the animators were coming at 10 and leaving at night, or like at 10 or so,

124
00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.460
but are at satellite.

125
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.590
Everybody was coming in the afternoon to a four and was walking

126
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.570
at a 6:00 AM.

127
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.890
<v 0>Oh God, Jesus. A lot more like hardcore.</v>
