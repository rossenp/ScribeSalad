1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.150
<v 0>I legit would worry if my kid got like addicted to porn,</v>

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.850
because like you hear about the adults who get addicted to porn,

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.690
like Tommy Cruz's addicted to porn. Right. Was he? Yeah,

4
00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:11.510
he was addicted to porn, I think. Um, and there was generally like,

5
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.540
I sent you a link. So I, I was on YouTube and there's just a video,

6
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.030
something called, like coming clean or something. Remember it.

7
00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:19.490
And it was just this guy who was just like, no one,

8
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.950
no one had exposed him on YouTube. No one had said anything.

9
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.340
He just came out with it. He was just like, I'm addicted to porn guys.

10
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.710
I'm going broke because he's like, Oh, you had a few million.

11
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.660
And he was just like, Oh yeah. Oh, I do remember that.

12
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.640
He was that guy who was in like a happy relationship.

13
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.430
She wasn't married was me happily married. He wasn't, he wasn't like a,

14
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.810
it was like a buff. Really good looking dude. Yeah.

15
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.560
And he was just like, yes. So like, I'm just like horribly addicted to porn.

16
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.440
<v 1>He just, he just spent his money on chatter.</v>

17
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.490
<v 0>Bay so bad for the dude. And it's like, you know,</v>

18
00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.190
had this like come out any other way. People probably would've mocked him,

19
00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:55.971
but he, you know,

20
00:00:55.971 --> 00:00:58.570
he spoke about it himself and he kind of felt like really bad for the dude.

21
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.070
You're like, I can't, I,

22
00:01:00.071 --> 00:01:03.260
I can't sympathize per se because I would not sympathize. I, I can't, you know,

23
00:01:03.261 --> 00:01:05.240
experience that myself. But like, I was like, dude,

24
00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:07.910
I would never want that on like my kid or something to be like,

25
00:01:07.911 --> 00:01:12.800
cripplingly addicted to like virtual video porn. Right.

26
00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:14.630
Whatever. I don't, I feel so bad about it.

27
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.060
<v 1>I think it especially hurts considering the fact that like,</v>

28
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.100
he's going broke because of it as well.

29
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.450
<v 0>And luckily the guy like, the video is really good. I break my watch again,</v>

30
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.750
like just to like, I dunno. And, and his wife was like understanding of it.

31
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:28.790
And then she helped like walk him through it. I just,

32
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.030
it was really sweet and I hope the guy's doing better now. I've, I've no idea.

33
00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:33.800
I didn't watch any of the videos, but like,

34
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.400
how'd you even get to a point when you ride Gary? Like what, what, what is,

35
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.130
what is the line where you were addiction?

36
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.480
<v 1>What is a porn addiction? You know? It's, is it how snap.</v>

37
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.940
<v 0>It's going to kill me for that job?</v>

38
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.520
<v 1>Yeah. It's like, is it to the point where it's like,</v>

39
00:01:49.521 --> 00:01:52.970
you're spending so much money that it's like putting a dent on your car to spend

40
00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:56.210
money on porn? I mean, aside from.

41
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.500
<v 0>You, off. Yeah.</v>

42
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.570
I can handle the hot say I've never spent any money on Poland.

43
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.190
I feel like that is like a big line to cross where you're comfortable getting

44
00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:10.490
your credit card out to put in. Right. That's like just a lie.

45
00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:15.170
I don't want to cross. And I'd be really sad in my son or my daughter. If I,

46
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.780
they were like, you have got a premium Brasa subscription. Like why.

47
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.430
<v 1>Y yeah. I don't know what it like to me spending money on like Kensai games or</v>

48
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:24.890
something. I completely understandable.

49
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.420
As soon as you spend money on like, I guess real life porn,

50
00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:33.530
for some reason that just flips a switch me to be like, how, why?

51
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.230
I think it's because they're like, unlike irrigators,

52
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.090
like hand-eye and stuff like that.

53
00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:42.140
There are so many options to get the same experience for free. That's it? Right.

54
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.850
Because I've, I'm guessing none of us have ever actually bought a hint. I DVD.

55
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.100
<v 0>Well, I did. I did. Oh, okay. Okay.</v>

56
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.270
I bought the classic. I bought mother knows breasts. Did you actually,

57
00:02:56.271 --> 00:02:58.040
I actually bought it. Yeah. I bought a physical cough.

58
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.460
Cause obviously the podcast. Yeah. I, it hasn't arrived yet because I was like,

59
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.580
I noticed that the licensor who's selling it. Uh,

60
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:08.860
they eventually delist the older ones and I thought, well,

61
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.550
I've got to get a copy of mother's breast just in case it goes into that.

62
00:03:11.551 --> 00:03:13.990
That doesn't count because you've already seen, I'm not gonna Jack off to it.

63
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.790
It's going to be pristine condition. I bought it to preserve.

64
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.940
<v 1>This is the you're going to frame.</v>

65
00:03:20.941 --> 00:03:23.850
And you're going to begin to show your kids and be like, kids cost me.

66
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.980
<v 0>$50. Yeah. Well.</v>

67
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.720
<v 1>That's understandable. Right? Like, no,</v>

68
00:03:27.721 --> 00:03:32.010
one's going to frame their Brazos subscription on a wall. Right. So it's like,

69
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.260
there are people out there, but.

70
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.840
<v 0>Because it's like, uh, you know, you hear about those, you know,</v>

71
00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:38.790
that'd be like politician scandals, and they'd be like,

72
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.630
he spent $40,000 on porn. I'm like, I don't even know how you would do that. Or.

73
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.940
<v 1>You stop to spend that much money on porn. I don't.</v>

74
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.710
<v 0>Even know how you go about how would you.</v>

75
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.950
<v 1>What I want to know is how would you not have enough sources of porn that you</v>

76
00:03:49.951 --> 00:03:50.784
need to spend money?

77
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.400
<v 0>Well, I think a lot of people want like specific porn, right?</v>

78
00:03:53.401 --> 00:03:56.820
Like I think again, like this is where a lot of like independent, craziest.

79
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.260
<v 1>No, no, that's, that's totally the reasonable. I only fans this thing because I.</v>

80
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.350
<v 0>Well, I would never pay $20 for something on a Jack off dude. Right, right.</v>

81
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.650
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, like for me, like I can't,</v>

82
00:04:07.651 --> 00:04:10.680
I can understand why people would want to support independent creators.

83
00:04:10.681 --> 00:04:13.500
Like for example, only fans or something, because you know, there,

84
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.660
there is that parasocial relationship in there.

85
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.230
And I can totally understand why people would want to spend money on that. Um,

86
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.240
I don't understand like browser subscriptions or just like when there is no,

87
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.820
parasocial where there is no social relationship.

88
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.020
<v 0>I would almost argue that only fans and all those parasocial relationships are</v>

89
00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:32.910
way worse off than getting a brand subscription.

90
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.080
I agree with Judy I've it is a dangerous line.

91
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.340
I don't even like dislike anything about it. I just feel sad.

92
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.550
But I look at it all. Like, I just feel sorry for everyone. Like, I mean,

93
00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:46.860
other than the creators are making bank right. Good for them.

94
00:04:46.861 --> 00:04:50.220
Like totally understandable. The grind you do what you gotta do. But like,

95
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.920
when you look at some of these guys and you see what some of them say online,

96
00:04:52.921 --> 00:04:54.970
like, you just feel sad for them. Like.

97
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.380
<v 1>This isn't to demerit any like, Oh, I don't.</v>

98
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.190
<v 0>Work or anything like that. This is a lot of the stuff they make is awesome.</v>

99
00:05:02.191 --> 00:05:05.850
And a lot of you put a lot of work into it. I just feel [inaudible].

100
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.420
<v 1>It's a dangerous line that I don't want to cross.</v>

101
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.850
<v 0>I want to go into that. Cause if you, if you pay for one,</v>

102
00:05:11.851 --> 00:05:14.970
I feel like you'll do it again. I'll probably buy another one.

103
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.290
<v 1>And it's dangerous for the creator as well, because then you get, you know,</v>

104
00:05:19.291 --> 00:05:22.740
some of these supporters who get a little too comfortable with it and try and

105
00:05:22.741 --> 00:05:24.690
start crossing. Like, I can't imagine,

106
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.650
I can't imagine what they have to deal with on the day or may get huge respect

107
00:05:28.651 --> 00:05:31.140
to them. Every type of like creepy dude, you know,

108
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.500
thinking that just because they paid like a grandiose amount of money to this

109
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.960
creator that suddenly they're like best friends, you know,

110
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.460
when that's just not how it works.

111
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.510
<v 0>Few of them on Twitter, this is pretty good to see like, Oh God,</v>

112
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.030
what do you see? But like, just seeing what they get up to is like it, I mean,

113
00:05:45.031 --> 00:05:47.550
it's sad. Some of the they got to deal with just to like,

114
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.720
you got to like fight just to take, to have people take you seriously.

115
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:52.350
Oh my God. Yeah.

116
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.250
<v 1>Yeah. Cause the thing is,</v>

117
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.590
I would like to think that everyone's end goal for watching porn is like, uh,

118
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.100
you know,

119
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.000
an offset for being able to go into like a happy relationship where you just

120
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:06.770
feel satisfied and um, and like happy with banjo life. So, you know,

121
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.030
you stop wanting to be horny.

122
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.430
<v 0>You just be happy. Yeah. I'm saying Bandon, horny, happy.</v>

123
00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.810
<v 1>I feel like if you go out and pay for porn,</v>

124
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.690
you're crossing a dangerous line where I've no return, right?

125
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.200
Not that you can't return from it, but you're, you're getting comfortable.

126
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.880
<v 0>And not be dangerous. I'm just perceive it to myself. Yeah. I mean,</v>

127
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.130
that sounds dangerous. Everyone has, everyone has different.

128
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.490
<v 1>Line. This is my line as well. Where if I go out and cross this line,</v>

129
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.780
it's the line that I'm not comfortable with myself being about. And you know,

130
00:06:37.781 --> 00:06:40.660
some people are comfortable and I'm sure there's healthy people out there who,

131
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:41.620
you know, have.

132
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.700
<v 0>I'm sure that's the thing with the addiction thing, right? Like it's like 95,</v>

133
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.380
95% of people are totally capable of self-regulating and not

134
00:06:50.381 --> 00:06:51.430
over-consuming things,

135
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.910
but there's a good amount of people out there where they find that one thing

136
00:06:54.911 --> 00:06:58.560
that just breaks them, they just can't stop. Like, it's just what it is.

137
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.810
<v 1>Yeah. And it's just, we go back to the point of how would you recognize what,</v>

138
00:07:01.811 --> 00:07:03.100
what point is too far?

139
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:08.200
Is it when your life is being actively ruined or when you just can't find a

140
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.213
happy relationship?

141
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.860
<v 0>Yeah. Which is like, again, why like going back to that video,</v>

142
00:07:11.861 --> 00:07:15.220
like massive props to the dude for being able to like stop himself and be like,

143
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.950
you know what? This is getting out of hand, realizing that it's appalling,

144
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:21.370
you know, honestly, like I, to me,

145
00:07:21.371 --> 00:07:25.000
I was just amazed that he was willing to talk about that publicly. And you know,

146
00:07:25.001 --> 00:07:26.440
to me, I was like, that's like,

147
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.800
that's like pretty big bowls to come out and be like, listen guys,

148
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.070
I'm addicted to porn knowing that people are gonna meme you. Yeah. But in,

149
00:07:33.071 --> 00:07:34.000
in reality, you know,

150
00:07:34.001 --> 00:07:36.040
there's probably a lot of people going through that and I have massive respect.

151
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.200
<v 1>The guy coming out. And I think I remember as well,</v>

152
00:07:38.201 --> 00:07:41.470
like from what I saw hardly any meaning at all,

153
00:07:41.471 --> 00:07:42.430
the comments were really positive.

154
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:46.420
<v 0>It's again, like w when the stuff is sensitive,</v>

155
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.070
people don't want to talk about it. Cause they mean it.

156
00:07:48.071 --> 00:07:50.770
But it's really important to have people come out and be like, listen,

157
00:07:50.771 --> 00:07:52.600
this is a real thing. I'm like, it's me over.

158
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.890
<v 1>Yeah. It's slowly, it's the exact same thing with, for example, Gacha addiction,</v>

159
00:07:56.891 --> 00:08:00.490
you know, we, we can meme the out of it. But if someone has an issue,

160
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.310
you should take it seriously.

161
00:08:03.311 --> 00:08:07.150
And you shouldn't just think that people are gonna mock you and meme the out of

162
00:08:07.151 --> 00:08:10.750
you. Some people will listen to anything is never good. Some people will,

163
00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:14.140
but the good people out there will actually understand that. You know,

164
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.050
you can have an embarrassing problem sometimes. Uh,

165
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.570
sometimes it's hard to tell when you've gone too far.

166
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:22.600
<v 0>Yo Joey plays our games. You know, like, I feel sorry for him, you know,</v>

167
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.500
you play leagues clean, clean, by the way,

168
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:35.470
you it's like duality of man. Right. Played a ranked game on my account.

169
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.240
And like for four or five months,
