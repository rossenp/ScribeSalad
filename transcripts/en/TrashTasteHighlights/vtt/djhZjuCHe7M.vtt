00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.680
<v 0>Would you say that attack on Titan is carrying your 20, 21 so far? Yeah, dude,</v>

2
00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:07.880
every episode I'm getting hyped for, she just, you know,

3
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.180
be appreciative of the fact that we're even getting a tack on time, right?

4
00:00:11.181 --> 00:00:13.580
Like in the midst of a pandemic. Huh? I mean,

5
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.900
the fact is that attack on Titan it's it could be carrying any here because I

6
00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:21.650
don't think that anything can live up to what attack and tightened season four

7
00:00:21.651 --> 00:00:22.520
is giving us right now.

8
00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:27.050
And I say this in the midst of what I would want the strongest seasons we've

9
00:00:27.051 --> 00:00:29.660
ever had. I would argue that this is the front,

10
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.520
this is a contender for one of the strongest seasons in the history of

11
00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:37.460
anime. That is a big statement,

12
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.410
but like it's so stacked in every

13
00:00:42.411 --> 00:00:47.300
single genre and every single kind of every single category you

14
00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:48.230
can think of that.

15
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.950
I can't think of a single person who can't find at least two or three shows that

16
00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.990
there'll be watching the season. And then on top of that,

17
00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:57.250
you have the classic being made. That is attack one time. Why would you, I,

18
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.530
you know, if I was an anime studio and I found out when talking type was airing,

19
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.920
I'd be like, you know what? Just hold on. Don't don't let's wait,

20
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.040
like on YouTube, you know, if you upload a video,

21
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.160
we had like Shane Dawson dropped a documentary. It was like, just, don't just,

22
00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:14.180
don't like movie companies being like, wait, Avengers in cinemas right now,

23
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.960
at least at the same time as Avengers, because they're like, no,

24
00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:21.380
one's going to watch it. Like almost I would have been like,

25
00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:24.290
just hold off because the attack on Titans going to carry,

26
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.720
like even if I only get to watch it once a week,

27
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.400
it's going to be in my mind the whole week.

28
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.790
So let's just hold off and give me a bang of next season. But now they, all,

29
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.100
everyone was like, let's all come out right now.

30
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.820
Let's let's all have all our bangers right now with this one season.

31
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.230
Cause like the amount of like,

32
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.650
we we've had a few seasons previously with some season twos here and there,

33
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.230
but it seems like every season too,

34
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.350
or like sequel the season is a banger. Yeah.

35
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.280
Because like his beast is airing right now. Right. Okay. So do not know any,

36
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.750
no one is talking about it. Yeah,

37
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.990
because that attack on Titan is the only thing. Okay. Okay.

38
00:01:56.991 --> 00:02:00.220
So we got B stars too. We got, gotta be amazing. We've got promise.

39
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.480
We've got promise. Never lapsed. No one promise Netherland came out.

40
00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:09.170
It was massive. He was the only one spoke about. Yeah. Um,

41
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.970
we got lock horizon three. Quintz two quintessential quintuplets too.

42
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.800
We got um, Dr. Stone. Uh huh. I sleep,

43
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.510
I sleep attack on Titan season two. I work basically.

44
00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:25.640
I mean like it's how can you not man?

45
00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:28.640
Like every episode is just like a like rollercoaster.

46
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.000
And like for a lot of people we can on this for like five plus years

47
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.110
journey. Right. It's it's and it's,

48
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.740
and it's one of the few ones where it feels like it's run its natural course and

49
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.470
it's actually, it's actually coming to an end. You know what I mean?

50
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.700
And you know, I,

51
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.050
I said in a tweet that I feel like this is like watching a classic being made

52
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.130
and I have no doubts that if like,

53
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.740
even if he doesn't like completely slam dunk the ending,

54
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.740
even if it's just an okay satisfying ending,

55
00:02:57.741 --> 00:03:00.790
it's going to go down as long as it's not like the crummiest ending.

56
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.900
Imagine wait for it. Multi-verse predicted multinationals,

57
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.320
which I would like to think is not going to happen.

58
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.570
[inaudible] is there in the season? You just can't compete. No,

59
00:03:12.571 --> 00:03:14.280
one's talking about anything and I'm just like,

60
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.780
there's so many bang is the season and like attack on Titan.

61
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.490
He's just taking over. Sure.

62
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.920
Cause I remember I was watching the last season of breaking bad as it was airing

63
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.460
week by week. I'm sure I watched other TV shows during that time.

64
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.060
I cannot tell you what I watched other than, than breaking bad.

65
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.840
Like it was like the highlight, right? Like it's what it takes up your,

66
00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:36.540
your space and your hype for like, or for what's going to,

67
00:03:36.541 --> 00:03:41.010
it's going to be 26 episodes, right? No, it's going to be 14. It's 14. Yeah.

68
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.710
So right now, now from what I've heard like this, this is,

69
00:03:43.711 --> 00:03:48.030
this is me going off of whatever, a speculation, warning margarita.

70
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.270
So it's going to be 14 episodes, I think 14 or 15,

71
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.670
which doesn't take it up to the end of the Mongo.

72
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.030
Cause the end of the manga ends in April sample. Yeah.

73
00:03:57.031 --> 00:03:58.680
I heard that April or may. I can't remember,

74
00:03:58.681 --> 00:04:02.760
but it's confirmed that the Monga is going to be ending this late spring,

75
00:04:02.761 --> 00:04:03.600
summer kind of time.

76
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.420
I thought they were trying to do like a Juul ending where it was going to be.

77
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.430
They both were like ending at the same time. I thought,

78
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.150
Oh we can animate originally. No, no like it was gonna, he was probably gonna,

79
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.030
I thought he meant maybe he was going to like tell them the studio, the ending.

80
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.790
So what's so with the confirmed amount of episodes, that's out so far,

81
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.970
what people are thinking is going to happen is either we're going to get a

82
00:04:23.971 --> 00:04:27.750
season four part to or we are going to get a movie.

83
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.820
Oh I will. I'm speculating. It's going to be a mood thing.

84
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.020
I think a movie Cal successful demons. I know,

85
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.410
I know they get to see that Nick probably saw them, was like,

86
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.380
we can do that with the last attack on Titans thing.

87
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.400
Just saying honestly like if I'm up to speed, run the Hong go real quick.

88
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.020
[inaudible] Joey was saying, there's a type it out.

89
00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.690
Please live translate for me. Come on. Yeah. I'll hire a professional light.

90
00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.910
You know the ones that the governments, when they go to the meetings,

91
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.250
I'll hire them to get in the seat behind me in the theater.

92
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.490
All I get to say is like personal reasons.

93
00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:11.790
I wish I hope it's going to be a movie just so I can be the first one to make a

94
00:05:11.791 --> 00:05:12.624
video on it.

95
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.750
[inaudible] I'm going to go to the midnight screening and I'm going to make a

96
00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:19.950
video and be like, yeah guys.

97
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.600
It was Epic that time where I would not do that. I'm kidding. I'm joking.

98
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.463
I wouldn't,

99
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.240
I would not ruin possibly one of the greatest animates to go down in history

100
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.860
just for YouTube click. But I'd be like, Hey guys, I think I know what happened.

101
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.570
I watched it all three times.

102
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.390
I think I got the gist of what's going on with maiden the best.

103
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.470
What the is the movie legit? We watched the meat and the best movie. We'd like,

104
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.490
obviously there's no subtitles. I'm pretty sure I understood what happened.

105
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.130
I'm pretty happy. I'm pretty sure I got it. I got the GS was like plot, plot,

106
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.840
questionable child pop plot. And then

107
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.840
I was just like, Oh Kevin, you didn't, you did a, you did a good joke.

108
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.130
Cause Kevin was sitting right next to him. This song is good, man.

109
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.890
It's like go into hall, questionable child hall music. Good.

110
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.470
Basically. But yeah, like I,

111
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.200
everyone said the meaning of this movie was amazing and I'm just like,

112
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.360
I had a good time. I still haven't seen it. Honestly. It's fine.

113
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.660
I mean, I'm not going to take the one

114
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.950
who understood half of what was being said. It was fine.
