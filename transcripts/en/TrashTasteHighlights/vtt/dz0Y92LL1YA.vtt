1
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:06.240
<v 0>Right. I'm bored talking about anime. We're not even anatomy podcast anymore.</v>

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.580
Imagine talking about anime on trash guys.

3
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.970
<v 1>I feel like I'm, I'm attempting to be the Winnie, the Pooh meme, like the, the,</v>

4
00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:15.560
the like high class, or when I talk about adamant, I'm trying to full opinions.

5
00:00:15.561 --> 00:00:17.480
I don't have opinions. I don't have, well,

6
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.970
I don't have well formed opinions about things. I just say what I feel. Okay.

7
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:23.660
I mean, you don't.

8
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.600
<v 0>I have well formed opinions,</v>

9
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.250
like Rick anime gaming, like let's,

10
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.030
let's be honest here.

11
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.210
<v 1>All my streaming of the day being like, God is actually like,</v>

12
00:00:35.211 --> 00:00:39.830
your parents didn't beat you enough because like, because right,

13
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.610
listen, he was allowed to get away with not eating crust. Right.

14
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:44.810
If I didn't need my crop.

15
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.910
<v 0>If I.</v>

16
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.160
<v 1>Didn't eat my cross. Right. You know what my parents would do. They'd be like,</v>

17
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.640
that's fine. It, you have dinner ready for tomorrow. Now I'd be like, mom,

18
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.850
I don't, I don't want them. She's like, no, Connie, you crust.

19
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.750
<v 0>Wasting food. Who says that? I didn't get my beat for not eating my cross.</v>

20
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.250
I will not bow cross because I had gone my entire

21
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.520
childhood having to like being forced to eat my cross.

22
00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:15.230
So as soon as I was a fully grown adult who can make my own decisions,

23
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.140
I'm going to be, I was, I was, I was like, mother,

24
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.590
I did not care what you think anymore. I'm going to not eat my cross.

25
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.420
I pay my own rent. I pay my own bills. I buy my own food. you, mother.

26
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.580
<v 1>All I'm saying is you should got a backhand a little bit more.</v>

27
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.670
<v 0>Yeah. There is a bad joke.</v>

28
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.280
There, there is. There is something that like,

29
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.310
I didn't fully appreciate as a kid or like,

30
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.780
I didn't fully cross like cross good food, not cross, but like,

31
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.150
I gotta to get a food by the way, whenever we're not getting into food again.

32
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.170
But like I was yesterday,

33
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.100
I was cleaning the house and I hate cleaning the house.

34
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.420
I don't think anyone in their entire life lies cleaning the house.

35
00:01:56.421 --> 00:02:01.250
And I didn't realize why my parents basically just every parent

36
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.770
manipulates their kids to be like their personal slaves,

37
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.080
my jobs when it comes to like cleaning the house.

38
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.050
<v 1>Oh, that's, that's the reason why they used to have so many kids. Right.</v>

39
00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:11.300
And it was like, they got to plow the fields. Right.

40
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.630
I intend to keep that British philosophy alive. When I have a kid,

41
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.100
he needs to plow the fields and clean the house and prepare them.

42
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.550
<v 0>Yeah. Connor's going to like min backs. That. My house has a six rooms.</v>

43
00:02:24.551 --> 00:02:28.850
So that's six children. I need to have at least one per room.

44
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.030
<v 1>I'm not, I'm not going to beat my kids by the way. That was a distasteful joke.</v>

45
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.923
Just say that now.

46
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.490
<v 0>Cause like, why is the, why is the like activity of cleaning?</v>

47
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:39.890
Just so awful. Like,

48
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.270
like does anyone who, who actually enjoys cleaning the house when you do it?

49
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.410
Right.

50
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.700
<v 1>When you have it, like, you get rid of a lot of dirt. Right?</v>

51
00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:51.710
That's why I let it, I let it build up. I let it get like gross.

52
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.130
Because when you clean that, it's like peeling off a good scab.

53
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.820
<v 0>Oh, it's so clean. Yeah. But I need to see like a physical layer of dust.</v>

54
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.350
<v 1>For me. It'd be like,</v>

55
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.030
when you swipe a whole layer of dust off with like a wet wipe or something,

56
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.510
that feels good. That takes, that caught a child at least.

57
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.480
But I don't like cleaning. It's not.

58
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.150
<v 0>Because like, yeah, that, that is a satisfying feeling.</v>

59
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.260
But my problem with is that cleaning just. Like I never knew as a kid,

60
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.640
how much time and effort it takes to clean. Like, because okay,

61
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.470
when you're a kid, you just clean your own room.

62
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.900
[inaudible] I didn't even do that or whatever. Oh, you, you lucky. You like,

63
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.080
I would, but then five minutes later, I'd be back to where it was.

64
00:03:34.081 --> 00:03:35.250
So my parents were just like, whatever.

65
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.370
Like I still have Vietnam flashbacks of my mom calling me. Like,

66
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.530
I know she's about to ask you to Hoover the living room. I,

67
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.980
I don't want to come down right now. It's timeout having. But yeah.

68
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.250
Like, like I realized as an adult, the act of cleaning,

69
00:03:50.251 --> 00:03:52.980
just like it takes you all day. And like,

70
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.000
the reason I hate it is because it feels like, you know,

71
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.020
when you do something productive, like you do,

72
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.530
you do like a hard day of work or something, or like even playing a video game.

73
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.630
<v 1>You feel like you're making progress with your life. I don't know.</v>

74
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.290
<v 0>About the video game thing, but I like, like, you know, when, when, like for me,</v>

75
00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:08.130
whenever I'm playing like a.

76
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.410
<v 1>First person game, like a single player game.</v>

77
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.683
<v 0>Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah.</v>

78
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:20.850
[inaudible] cleaning like the whole,

79
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.440
the entire concept of cleaning is that you're working towards making things

80
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.530
zero. Again, you're working towards zero. You're walking,

81
00:04:28.531 --> 00:04:30.390
you're working towards making things.

82
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.420
<v 1>Oh, it switched off. Sorry. Uh, Joey, Joey a laptop is.</v>

83
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.190
<v 0>Yeah. You're working towards, towards making the default site, state zero again.</v>

84
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.070
And I'm just like, this doesn't feel good yet.

85
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.370
It takes so much time and energy to do it. And no one prepared,

86
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.900
no one prepared this for me as a kid, it's like shoveling snow in a blizzard.

87
00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:55.200
Right. It's gonna, it's gonna form back up again. So I was like,

88
00:04:55.201 --> 00:04:56.034
what's the point?

89
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.860
<v 1>I only used to clean. I'm like, like, this is how I would,</v>

90
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.690
I would decide if I'm going to clean this day.

91
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.570
There's somebody coming to my house. No, I'm not cleaning.

92
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.080
If somebody comes to that is still, my staff is somebody coming to my house.

93
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.973
Fine. I'll clean.

94
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.730
You know what the best adult purchase I ever made was in the UK.

95
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.980
It was a good vacuum. I was like, you know what?

96
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.040
What's all this hype around those Dyson things. What is all that happened?

97
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.390
Cause I, I lived with a friend.

98
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.770
I lived with a guy and his dad worked for the Henry Henry Hoovers. Yeah.

99
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:23.663
It was like the.

100
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.120
<v 0>Smile smiley face. Yeah.</v>

101
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.160
<v 1>We're in America. But everywhere in the UK, these things they're like tanks.</v>

102
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.580
They don't die. But they also kind of suck. They don't suck good.

103
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.360
They should be sucking good. And I'm like, this guy in my house. I was like,

104
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.910
I wanted to get a Dyson. And he was like, no, no, no, no, no.

105
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.270
All you need is this thing. And he's like slaps it. He's like, it's a unit.

106
00:05:45.271 --> 00:05:49.440
This thing is. And I, I, I broke it within like two weeks. Yeah.

107
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.230
<v 0>What the we lock up? Well,</v>

108
00:05:55.231 --> 00:05:59.630
that'll do it. I was, Oh no. I have to get a new home quick.

109
00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:02.930
Grab the Hoover. Oh no. I have to get a new, a new vacuum.

110
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.440
<v 1>So I bought a Dyson dude. That cleaned up. Like it could have, Oh my God,</v>

111
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.270
a copy. It was a different color. I was like,

112
00:06:10.271 --> 00:06:14.050
what have I been doing my whole life. I never believed in that. Dies as the too.

113
00:06:14.051 --> 00:06:15.850
Until I bought one lady a couple of years ago.

114
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.570
<v 0>Changes the game. How good these are. And I do. I was like, all right.</v>

115
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.790
Not buying anything else anymore.

116
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.150
<v 1>Up to like max sock and like, Oh my God.</v>

117
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.040
<v 0>Good sock the. The max socket. Here's how I could. Okay.</v>

118
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:31.383
This Dyson has all this.

119
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.990
<v 1>About rotating things like 10 cylinder. It's a load of.</v>

120
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.820
Let me say why it's good, right? Yeah.

121
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.030
You don't have one piece that always sticks. The carpet that doesn't come off.

122
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.060
Dyson never has an issue. Getting that one crumb out of the car.

123
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.050
That always comes out because the normal vacuums, they don't get that out.

124
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.140
Like there's always that one thing that for some reason won't come out,

125
00:06:50.141 --> 00:06:50.974
you gotta it.

126
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.130
<v 0>Yeah. And then you're like, how many, how many.</v>

127
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.490
<v 1>Rollovers am I going to do this thing until I just admit defeat, bend over,</v>

128
00:06:57.491 --> 00:07:00.340
pull out of the carpet, like an animal and feed it into the vacuum.

129
00:07:00.341 --> 00:07:01.600
Like at some budget dog in my head.

130
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.143
<v 0>I don't like doing that.</v>

131
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.900
<v 1>I'm not a peasant. I shouldn't have to touch my coffee with my hands.</v>

132
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.920
That's disgusting. So yeah. That's how I can sell it to you.

133
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.330
You will never have to bend over.

134
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.570
<v 0>You'll never have to bend to the knee.</v>

135
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.830
<v 1>Amazing dude. And that was like my gift to my parents that I went to Japan.</v>

136
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.350
Cause I was, I couldn't bring it with me. So I was like, parents,

137
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.850
you can have my price per se.

138
00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.620
<v 0>Here's the vacuum. I'm like, I'm like bending.</v>

139
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.630
<v 1>You're over like giving them like the sort of Camelot, like, here you go.</v>

140
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.890
<v 0>Take it. Take my Dyson. V12. Max suck edition</v>

141
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:38.363
should be fair. But she.

142
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.570
<v 1>Well, it was all nonsense, but she tried it. She was like, all right, corner.</v>

143
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:44.590
This is a pretty good kid. [inaudible].
