WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.280
<v 0>Is, I do know your blood type [inaudible] Oh,</v>

2
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:09.750
I think. Is that good? Well, I mean, I know there's three different times,

3
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.470
right? There's O a, B and AB. Yeah. Yeah. The Brown one, right.

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.490
AB is the right one.

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.690
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, I should know because I have like a blood disease,</v>

6
00:00:17.691 --> 00:00:21.260
so I used to have a medical bracelet. You probably should know too.

7
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.470
Then you have a medical bracelet. Uh, that would be like, you know, if I,

8
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.110
if I am bleeding, please give me this thing specifically.

9
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.200
And then I know what your parents are. Uh, no, but then I lost that.

10
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.720
I lost the medical bracelet, so I don't know where it is. So, uh,

11
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.960
you probably shouldn't learn science. I haven't got a replacement.

12
00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:37.280
It's been like a few years now. Sorry.

13
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.620
<v 0>Mental, like have where that always.</v>

14
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.350
<v 1>Meant to, it's just like a suggestion from the docs.</v>

15
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.860
<v 0>What blows my mind? What blows my mind though, is that in Japan?</v>

16
00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:49.430
At least like in Japanese schools, like you can get bullied for your blood type.

17
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.270
man. That's next level bullying. It's like, it's like, Oh, you're an,

18
00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:55.480
a type racism with extra steps.

19
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.600
<v 1>Yeah. That does sound like a, an excuse. It's like, I think he's a filthy odor.</v>

20
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.350
<v 0>Yeah. You kind of hang out with us Oh times, because you're an, a type. Right.</v>

21
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.240
And like, because why does everyone know each other's blood type? Yeah.

22
00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:10.820
I think, I think it's because like, when you do like a health checks,

23
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.480
we did that. Yeah. I haven't done mine yet.

24
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.500
It shouldn't be written on your show. So to explain,

25
00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:19.850
since we're signed with geeks,

26
00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:24.080
plus we are technically under their health insurance and their company policy is

27
00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:26.810
that we have to get a health checkup once a year.

28
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.690
<v 1>Which everyone in Japan has to do is watch everyone in Japan.</v>

29
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.650
<v 0>Twice a year. Okay. We've been here for one year already mailing,</v>

30
00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:37.880
but we've already had one checkup. How does that work? Okay.

31
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:41.240
So we're supposed to go twice, just been once. Um,

32
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.960
and it was weird because I,

33
00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:48.680
it was weird seeing how efficient a health system can be.

34
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.660
Cause I haven't, I haven't gone yet. It took about 20 minutes. He was like,

35
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.850
okay, well still that's it.

36
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.930
<v 1>In 30 minutes, I, you do an x-ray, uh, your blood pressure,</v>

37
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.190
you get weighed or you get blood taken. Uh, you do a hearing and, uh,

38
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.070
psych tests, you talk to a doctor, he'll talk to you.

39
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.820
<v 0>And then you do a cardiogram and a cardiogram. Wow. 20 minutes.</v>

40
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.900
All in 30 minutes, it was like, it was like speed running. We, we,

41
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.400
we were speed running health checks. And they even had like Smiths as well.

42
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.070
[inaudible] x-ray split, done blood taking split. Let's go.

43
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.200
It literally felt like that. Cause it was like, cause I was about like, uh,

44
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.360
because I had some problems with my forms. I had to fill out my form again.

45
00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:35.180
So I was only about like five to 10 minutes behind Connor.

46
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.590
And by the time I had just like, just started my like I'm to call it,

47
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.260
I'm going to call it a conveyor belt. Cause that's what it felt like.

48
00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:45.860
It felt like I was in chicken run, being processed. Um, so I was,

49
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.530
I had just started the process and kinda was almost done.

50
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.930
It was the most efficient because I saw the list of all the things that get

51
00:02:53.931 --> 00:02:55.880
checked off. And I was like, Oh, this is going to be like an older.

52
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.160
<v 1>Yeah. You also have to pee the night before and bring it with you,</v>

53
00:02:58.161 --> 00:02:58.994
which I just always feel

54
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.973
[inaudible] what about my.

55
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.860
<v 0>Derives? So you go into this room.</v>

56
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.410
<v 1>It's like this really busy place in like Shinju,</v>

57
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:11.380
which I imagine a lot of people will go to Japan and then there's like,

58
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.290
you go to this reception area. There's like 12 desks, like, all right,

59
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:17.290
come here. You hand the form though. Right? Go upstairs. You go upstairs. Yeah.

60
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.130
Everyone's in like medical downs or whatever, really fancy office looking thing.

61
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.790
It's really odd. And it's basically just a small room.

62
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:26.800
Not even that big with like couches in the middle.

63
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.220
And then you can see the like section, like it's a food court of like,

64
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:32.830
what's going to do what? You can see everyone getting blood taken.

65
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:33.790
You can see everyone, you.

66
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.680
<v 0>See everyone doing everything. And then.</v>

67
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.480
<v 1>They're like, all right, go in this room, get changed.</v>

68
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:39.670
So you put the medical counter, you come back in and then right.

69
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.300
You have a number. So you have literally like a, a chicken and a font.

70
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.110
<v 0>It's like actually chicken diet is literally like.</v>

71
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.280
<v 1>Piece of meat being passed around the different things. You gotta get sanitized.</v>

72
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.310
<v 0>And so you just, they basically just come in,</v>

73
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.630
they're like number 124 and then you go in.

74
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.100
<v 1>And then you just have to like,</v>

75
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.000
hopefully understand what they're saying in Japanese. They tell you, Oh yeah,

76
00:04:00.001 --> 00:04:03.150
it was just fast. It was like, boom, boom, boom. Wow. But I was like, dude.

77
00:04:03.151 --> 00:04:05.850
I hate blood tests. I hate getting my blood test. Yeah. God,

78
00:04:05.851 --> 00:04:08.010
I haven't done that in a while. And then I was like, I was just.

79
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.220
<v 2>Yeah, yeah. I got to do my next week. Yeah.</v>

80
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.810
<v 1>That's fun. It's fun. Isn't it?</v>

81
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.770
<v 0>It's not it's as fun as a health check can be because I,</v>

82
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.670
it was something that was so alien for me, especially coming from the UK,

83
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.610
which you know, big RPNs NHS for giving, giving everyone,

84
00:04:23.611 --> 00:04:26.810
everyone free healthcare. But the price you pay for that is that you have to.

85
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.760
<v 2>Wait for every yeah, yeah. Yeah.</v>

86
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.960
<v 0>When I say everything, even just going to the GP it's sometimes,</v>

87
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.500
sometimes you're like, you got a fever or something. I've phoned up my GP.

88
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.660
And they're like, Oh we can't six days. Yeah. We can't,

89
00:04:39.661 --> 00:04:42.330
we can't book you in until next week. And I'm just like, great.

90
00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:44.250
I guess I'll just try to sleep off this

91
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.440
week then I'm by the time you can see the GP you've already most of the time

92
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.850
you've you've already recovered. Yeah.

93
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.010
<v 1>Yeah. I think I never see the doctor in London,</v>

94
00:04:53.011 --> 00:04:55.290
but I booked three times to see it when I was like dying.

95
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.850
And every time before the appointment,

96
00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.000
I got better and I had to cancel it because it was like, I'm already better.

97
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.270
Right. It literally takes a week. At least in London it's even, it's worse.

98
00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:05.250
But I remember like, I would like, I think I fall,

99
00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:07.980
I broke my arm one time when I was a kid and I was,

100
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.980
I was in the emergency room and I'm like, dude, I'm gonna have to get an x-ray.

101
00:05:10.981 --> 00:05:12.150
And they're like, yeah. So, uh,

102
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.420
come back in a week and a half and we'll give you an x-ray. And I'm like, what?

103
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.870
Like, what am I supposed to do in a week? What about my arm?

104
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.640
<v 0>Let's come back in a week and a half. And I'm like,</v>

105
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.760
but what I do tell them like, Oh, just don't do anything to it. I'm like,

106
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:27.610
don't do anything to it. I want to do for a week and a half. Not move my arm.

107
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.220
But he was so stupid, man.

108
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.640
And it was so weird going to the Japanese health checkup. And they like,

109
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.730
they started off with the x-ray. Cause like, when I think x-ray,

110
00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:37.680
I'm just like in my head, I'm just like,

111
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.530
I'm not getting an x-ray and unless it's something serious.

112
00:05:40.531 --> 00:05:43.680
So this is obviously like the big checkup. This is the x-ray but no,

113
00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:46.200
they looped us up. Looped us up with a x-ray man.

114
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.870
Like we went in there and then we just like, they they'd go,

115
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.190
please go to the x-ray machine.

116
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.220
<v 1>Uh, uh, rectangle on a wall and you just put your chest against it. Yeah.</v>

117
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.500
Really.

118
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.490
<v 0>Odd. Because when I x-ray, I imagined like the.</v>

119
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:01.603
<v 1>[Inaudible] it was bizarre.</v>

120
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.520
<v 0>I've never, I've never had an x-ray done before.</v>

121
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.750
So it was weird actually was the cardiogram, which a way where you, like,

122
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.370
I've never had that before. I've never had that before,

123
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.400
where it's like lie down on the bed and you kind of feel like a mental patient

124
00:06:12.401 --> 00:06:15.160
about to get lobotomized. Cause they put these suckers on you.

125
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.600
They put these socks on you and then they put these appendages on your, uh,

126
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.420
on your heart and your arms and legs. And yeah,

127
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.130
it just kind of feels like you're about to get on the bottom.

128
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.970
<v 1>I was waiting for like the electric shock to go hit me.</v>

129
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.090
But there nothing happened to me that they like they to loop me up as well.

130
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.770
They just put like lube on you. Cause I think I had chest hat.

131
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.530
It doesn't go with what me? What do you mean? It's it's a natural.

132
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.820
<v 0>Mail is a mailing is a,</v>

133
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.360
I'm not talking about my in-depth colonoscopy may or may of mailings off screen.

134
00:06:46.361 --> 00:06:47.194
Just like blushing.

135
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.610
<v 1>Which by the way, the smallest detail I was told, if you're over 35 every year,</v>

136
00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:55.460
you have to have a colonoscopy. Really? Yeah. Every year you have to call off.

137
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.780
<v 0>It's because of it's because uh, Japan in Japan,</v>

138
00:06:58.781 --> 00:07:02.890
hemorrhoids is a really common problem. I'm I'm legit. I'm legit serious.

139
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.440
Like I think it's, I think I saw something like crazy.

140
00:07:05.441 --> 00:07:09.400
Like one in four men in Japan have hemorrhoids. Yeah.

141
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.270
Connor was telling me afterwards that he doesn't want to call it an OCP because

142
00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:15.100
he's afraid that it'll awaken.

143
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:22.630
<v 1>[Inaudible] if I dig it, man, what are you going to like crack a fat on the</v>

144
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:29.380
[inaudible]. Cause I was, I was momentarily confused as a cold be on my weight

145
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.213
. I'm like, which end is that? Cause.

146
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.290
<v 0>What about it? Would you rather something go up your or down your throat? My.</v>

147
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.530
I thought he thought he was going down your throat.

148
00:07:44.531 --> 00:07:47.350
So they check your throat or down like, what's that called?

149
00:07:47.351 --> 00:07:48.184
That's a different thing. Right.

150
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.890
<v 1>And I was like, I was like, totally down. I'm like, all right, fine.</v>

151
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.753
Put it in my.

152
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.500
<v 0>Down my throat, whatever up my.</v>

153
00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.103
<v 1>No, no, no. It's the opposite.</v>

154
00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.300
<v 0>Something on my man down my throat.</v>

155
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.650
<v 1>[Inaudible] what would you then also,</v>

156
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.990
when we would do this health checkup as well, they would like,

157
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.740
we had like the blood pressure thing and like the thing in it,

158
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.520
which also always feels squeezes your arm. And then the doctor was like, yeah,

159
00:08:15.521 --> 00:08:17.260
you did. You did good on that. And I'm like, what does that mean?

160
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.390
What does that mean? What is doing bad?

161
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.170
I'm like explain what did good means that your numbers are good? I'm like, yeah,

162
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:27.040
explain the numbers to me. What is this supposed to mean? I got, there was like,

163
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:27.160
I.

164
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.530
<v 0>Put all my attention into my arm to change my blood pressure.</v>

165
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.380
<v 1>I wasn't, I was doing something like hunt to hunt and then on that thing.</v>

166
00:08:32.381 --> 00:08:34.120
I'm like heart rate, zero.

167
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:36.760
<v 0>Avatar, blood bending. It's just like.</v>

168
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.300
<v 1>I will now make my heart rate zero. So my enemies cannot find me.</v>

169
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:46.030
<v 0>And we got our blood taken and I remember we would talk before we got a blood</v>

170
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.390
test. We were talking about, you know,

171
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.280
we were talking about how the Japanese health system that we've had.

172
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.480
We've all had pretty good experiences with the Japanese health system because we

173
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.390
will have like, I don't know why we will have like that inherent fear that,

174
00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:58.320
you know, everyone's had a,

175
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.540
experience Winnie have taken the blood and they've just missed the vein. Right.

176
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.360
That happened to me.

177
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:08.833
<v 1>That's really, yeah.</v>

178
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.970
<v 0>For shadowing, that happened to me.</v>

179
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.240
Cause I knew it as soon as he stuck the needle in. Cause you know, you,

180
00:09:14.241 --> 00:09:17.450
you can feel it when, when like it goes straight to your vein. Yeah.

181
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:20.510
It feels exactly like the doctor describes it's just like a prick. Right.

182
00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:21.680
And it just comes out.

183
00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:26.420
So he sticks this needle in and I could feel immediately that something was

184
00:09:26.421 --> 00:09:27.590
wrong. Cause he was like,

185
00:09:27.591 --> 00:09:29.960
that's not a vein that's muscle and you start feeling pain.

186
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.740
And I felt sorry for anyone who has like a needle phobia. Cause I'm gonna,

187
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.300
I'm not like, so I can feel him like kind of twitching the needle around.

188
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.450
I'm just like, how do I tell him it's not there?

189
00:09:41.451 --> 00:09:42.410
How do I tell them this or that?

190
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.710
And he does it for like a full like minute before he realizes,

191
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.160
Oh there's no blood coming out. And I look and I look pulling up fat.

192
00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:53.330
I look over and there's like, you know, you know, like the vial of blood,

193
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.140
there's like the volume, the volume was filled up that much. Like the man,

194
00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:02.000
he was poking my arm and I'm like, like scar tissue, done, man. I knew it.

195
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.863
So.

196
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.500
<v 1>Oh gosh, embarrassed. I was like, I want to be cool. And not like, like myself.</v>

197
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.410
Yeah. But then I was like, Oh God. And I was like, Oh no, the nurse is cute.

198
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:10.520
Oh no, I can't. I'm going to.

199
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:11.750
<v 0>Needles.</v>

200
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.290
I feel needles are the only time where you can bring out your inner and just be

201
00:10:15.291 --> 00:10:19.340
like, I don't, I don't, I can't look at the needle going in. I like,

202
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:24.140
Oh I have to look at the needle. Yeah. I like, it's on the contrary for me.

203
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.420
If I, if he's like, all right, we're going to go in.

204
00:10:26.421 --> 00:10:29.990
And if I don't see it and I feel a prick that scares me, he's just like,

205
00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.100
he's like, it's going in. Yeah.

206
00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.713
<v 1>[Inaudible]. What about, what about staring at you being like pierced helps you?</v>

207
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.860
<v 0>Because I know when the pain is coming.</v>

208
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:44.893
<v 1>You know what I mean?</v>

209
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:48.860
<v 0>Then you're expecting the pain.</v>

210
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.890
That's worse for me is unexpected pain where I'm just like.

211
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.530
<v 1>Feel it if you don't look there. No, no, no. I feel it more if I don't.</v>

212
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:01.490
<v 0>Yeah, because that's, that's like, have you, have you ever like cut yourself?</v>

213
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.560
I'll have like an injury. You don't feel it all day.

214
00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.320
And then suddenly you look at it and you're like, wow, there's a cut.

215
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.250
And then suddenly you start feeling it that's me. That's me and needles. Really?

216
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.650
Because every time I get cut, it's just like, I can't be a pain.

217
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.640
Like I can't imagine seeing blood literally gush out of my veins and thinking,

218
00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:21.050
yeah, that's a, that looks like dirt. Like during the summer, for instance,

219
00:11:21.051 --> 00:11:23.480
like, cause like during the summer, your blood pressure is a lot higher.

220
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.840
So when the blood comes out, it kind of just like gushes out and I'm just like,

221
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:31.460
Oh, that looks sick. I like looking at that. It's kind of cool. I missed.

222
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.730
<v 1>Coming out of my body. It was a kid.</v>

223
00:11:34.731 --> 00:11:36.950
They would just give me this like contraption that was just like filled with

224
00:11:36.951 --> 00:11:38.480
like paint oil. And it were just like,

225
00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.000
all of it would like you would flip it over and it stopped playing like crazy.

226
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:44.960
We should do that to distract because I was like, wow, look at that thing guys.

227
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.980
The Bible I'm like, Whoa, that's cool. That's weird. I can't do that. Really.

228
00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:51.680
I was just like, I put my hand on the table. I'm like, go ahead.

229
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.010
You smacked it all. I.

230
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.950
<v 0>Was like, I was like, cool. I was like, Kaline there, go ahead.</v>

231
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.550
Why'd you have to like smack it. I'm like, come on,

232
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.750
get ready boy belt in the mouth. I'm not using mine.

233
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:07.630
We're using mine was with me because,

234
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:11.170
because normally when I get my blood taken, I'm used to it being like a,

235
00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:12.760
like a private place. You know what I mean?

236
00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.830
So we get our blood takens, like a conveyor belt. And I was just like,

237
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:19.960
I hang up the next guy. I think the guy next to me,

238
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:24.160
he's taken three of us right here getting our blood take. It was very odd.

239
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:25.240
And neither of us could look at the,

240
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.690
look at the blood getting taken and we just like met eyes and just like,

241
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.350
it's like me to guys in a urinal. It's like, this is awkward.

242
00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.390
How's your day going? Oh, that's that's uh,

243
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.220
that's you look like an old type there. I forgot

244
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.630
what I was trying to strike up. Any conversation.

245
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.430
<v 1>It is odd that we kind of made it into a private thing in the West. Right?</v>

246
00:12:47.431 --> 00:12:49.860
Like does it breathing to be private getting your blood taken?

247
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.580
<v 0>I mean, it doesn't, but I would, I feel,</v>

248
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.690
I think it's that people would prefer it. Right.

249
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.780
<v 1>But if, if, if that means that, you know,</v>

250
00:12:57.781 --> 00:13:00.120
I get medical tests way quicker in the UK,

251
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:04.230
by all means do my colonoscopy in front of the other patients. I do not mind.

252
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:05.183
Like, let's get this.

253
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:06.660
<v 0>It's like, Oh, you crack the fat too.</v>

254
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:11.070
<v 1>Does that means I can get it done 20% faster?</v>

255
00:13:11.071 --> 00:13:14.580
And I can get on with my day gladly. I'll I'll I'll get it. I'll get my blood.

256
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:16.710
If I fail in front of a group of 20 people who cast.

257
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.470
<v 0>In my head, I was like, Oh, this is going to be an all day thing.</v>

258
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.800
I got a health chicken anywhere else. All day.

259
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:24.360
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. Well,</v>

260
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:28.170
I think the worst part was that you couldn't eat or drink anything the night

261
00:13:28.171 --> 00:13:31.230
before, after 8:00 PM, you have to stop eating and drinking.

262
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.910
And normally that wouldn't be a problem.

263
00:13:32.911 --> 00:13:36.870
But when you tell me I can't eat and drink, I'm like, well. Now I want to.

264
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.290
<v 0>Well, now I want to just drink water or you can drink the NICU.</v>

265
00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.140
I was going to say, I drink, but water is the only thing.

266
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.280
<v 1>Drink alcohol. I was like British people like shaking.</v>

267
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:52.230
<v 0>Yeah. Basically no substance, like in your bloodstream,</v>

268
00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:57.090
the nicest substance. What are you? What are you taking? God. God's like,

269
00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:58.770
you got to put the belt and spoon away.

270
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.210
They're going to see my heroin veins and everything, man.

271
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:09.270
So hit the heroin vain. Don't don't worry. I got this. I've done this before.

272
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:16.260
I'm kidding. This is a joke. How does Karen again, you take a pint of heroin.

273
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.600
It's a pain. It's a pain.

274
00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.030
<v 1>Can't believe the trash tastes. Boys might like it,</v>

275
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.460
but in the light of drug addicts, hounded. Wow.

276
00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:26.940
<v 0>In case you don't get sarcasm, none of us have done heroin</v>

277
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:31.170
yet. I'm less.

278
00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.420
<v 1>That's the dark arc of the trash.</v>

279
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.260
<v 0>Trailer. Trash taste. Oh my God.</v>
