WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.690
<v 0>Definitely a lot of Americans can't tell the difference between a lot of British</v>

2
00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:06.120
accents. Well, I can get that. Yeah.

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.710
<v 1>American folks, like where are you from in Australia? I'm like, uh, I'm not,</v>

4
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.100
I don't know why British Australia seems to care.

5
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.250
<v 0>Do you get mixed up quite well? Even though I think to us, it's like,</v>

6
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.150
it's complete opposite. Yeah.

7
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.380
<v 1>But I think to me, Australia acts is a really different.</v>

8
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.700
<v 0>He doesn't sound bad Australian. I don't sound as no,</v>

9
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.870
no, he doesn't sound, I don't sound as Australian as I used to

10
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.640
dust that to a man. If you go back,

11
00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:39.020
if you go back like the early in my channel, I sound Australian as YouTube.

12
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.240
Very Northern. Yeah. I mean,

13
00:00:44.241 --> 00:00:46.520
do you not sound less British as you've gone.

14
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.940
<v 1>In Japan? Week one,</v>

15
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.210
I landed in Yamagata and my three teachers who I was going to work with and meet

16
00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:54.860
me at the airport. And I was like, it.

17
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.480
It's such a long flight raves hide in the closet. And they're like, I,

18
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.620
for one hour we ate like a dentist and they just kept talking and talking.

19
00:01:03.621 --> 00:01:07.430
They kept going after this. They were like, we don't,

20
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.200
we didn't know what you were saying.

21
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.350
<v 0>I never do the Japanese. Hello.</v>

22
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.740
<v 1>They're like, we don't know what you were saying. Oh yeah. And from then on,</v>

23
00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:19.220
I was like, hello, my name is Chris. I'm from London.

24
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.620
They're reign the UK. You know,

25
00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:26.330
I might have to change my voice really like Royal pronunciation. Oh eight.

26
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.130
Then it'd be a little tight. Can I used to say.

27
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.700
<v 0>Do you find sometimes that you speak almost like broken English sometimes to.</v>

28
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:32.930
<v 1>I've tried to stop doing that.</v>

29
00:01:32.931 --> 00:01:35.570
A lot of English teachers in Japan do the stupid voice.

30
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.920
Like I went shopping with my friends yesterday and they're like, do like really?

31
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.890
I don't see it. Right. Yeah. You got it.

32
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.300
<v 0>I'll talk to people and I'll just deconstruct my English live just because I'm</v>

33
00:01:47.301 --> 00:01:50.320
like, I think they'll understand if I say it this way, but then,

34
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.020
but then I'll go on to speak to God and I'll be like, hi, gaunt.

35
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.450
How are you today? You know.

36
00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.390
<v 1>Environment where for weeks at a time,</v>

37
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.940
I was the only foreigner around speaking English.

38
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.650
My English level actually went down,

39
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.370
not being able to speak English for like a month. It's really weird.

40
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.620
I've had issues as a result, but like, yeah, my vocabulary level went down.

41
00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:16.130
I couldn't say words like in consequential or that wouldn't come up.

42
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.020
<v 0>[Inaudible] that just came to your mind. I was like, what,</v>

43
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:22.580
what is going to be a word.

44
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.990
<v 1>To get it? I'll be like, Oh, it's like, just wouldn't come out. I had that too.</v>

45
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.710
That like, when I first worked in a Japanese here, I worked in Niseko.

46
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.980
It's like a big ski resort in Hokkaido. Yes.

47
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.870
And I worked there for a month and it was like a kind of show, snow shovel,

48
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.950
general stuff around the lobbies and stuff.

49
00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:43.490
But all of the people who I worked with were just hundred percent from Hokkaido,

50
00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:44.720
like old Japanese people.

51
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.020
So I was forced to basically speak Japanese for a month straight.

52
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.890
And I remember I came back to Australia and I was like, Oh,

53
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:54.380
it's only been a month. Right. I'm like, of course this English,

54
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.120
my first language, of course, I'm not going to forget it.

55
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.260
But then I Australia was like, what was that word again?

56
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.530
<v 0>I would actually forget. So consequential concert something or all a.</v>

57
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.990
I don't, I don't know how to say it hard. You know,

58
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.400
it was just really difficult.

59
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.050
<v 1>In, in terms of like dumbing down your language. When speaking to like,</v>

60
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.130
you know, Japanese speakers,

61
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.960
I feel like anyone who has come from like a bilingual parents or like is

62
00:03:18.961 --> 00:03:23.400
bilingual and has had like Asian or parents who don't speak your native language

63
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.820
as well. It's something I've just grown up with. Cause whenever I,

64
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.450
whenever I speak to my parents, like mostly like for example,

65
00:03:30.451 --> 00:03:32.130
when I speak to my mom, I'm mostly speaking Thai,

66
00:03:32.131 --> 00:03:33.960
but when I have to express something in English,

67
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.840
I like very much have to dumb down my language.

68
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.240
Very careful about how I word things.

69
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.220
Because especially like learning a language, you know,

70
00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:43.560
how their grammar structure is. So, you know,

71
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.010
like sometimes you hear a Japanese people, like Japanese person speak,

72
00:03:47.011 --> 00:03:48.030
try to speak English. And he's like,

73
00:03:48.031 --> 00:03:52.320
you understand what their like mentality is or what their like train of thought

74
00:03:52.321 --> 00:03:55.890
is when I try and just like construct a sentence, kind of like, well,

75
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.880
you kind of learned to do is kind of mirror the way that they would construct a

76
00:03:59.881 --> 00:04:02.100
sentence so that they would eat more easily on the understand. Yeah.

77
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.300
<v 0>Especially what I find myself doing. Yeah. But also I forget like, um,</v>

78
00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.450
so I'll think of the word in Welsh. I'll be,

79
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.670
and I'll remember the Japanese word for it. And I'm like, what the is it?

80
00:04:11.671 --> 00:04:13.650
Which one is it? And then vice versa, I'll be speaking Japanese.

81
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.310
And I'll be like, Oh, why is the Welsh word? Keep popping up in my head?

82
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.260
And I'm trying to think of the right word. It's a mess.

83
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.540
Cause I obviously don't use those languages as much as I use English.

84
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.350
So my head they're slowly like amalgamating together. And it's, it's awful.

85
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.990
<v 1>I guess you're kind of getting to the point and, and you as all gone,</v>

86
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.470
you kind of,

87
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.470
you guys can until the point where you'll learning a third language. Right?

88
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.380
I mean, yeah. I mean, I, I tried to image this for you as a,

89
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.110
technically like a third language you're trying to learn or I trying to get.

90
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.070
<v 0>I try and use it as much as possible. I mean, I'm, I'm doing like, uh, on the,</v>

91
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.550
my new second channel.

92
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.270
<v 1>Whoa, wow.</v>

93
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.820
<v 0>Uh, doing a series where, um, uh,</v>

94
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.960
I guess playing games with Japanese people and using what broken Japanese I

95
00:04:51.961 --> 00:04:54.960
have. And sometimes I'm like about to say a word I'm like, Nope, that's,

96
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.600
that's the Welsh word. But if you haven't watched that, who's going to watch it.

97
00:04:57.601 --> 00:05:00.660
If you want to see my terrible, my terrible Japanese and action.

98
00:05:00.661 --> 00:05:03.060
But I do find that that has been the best practice I've had,

99
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.120
which is just talking because yeah,

100
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.820
unfortunately I'm at a very privileged situation where I don't need to talk to

101
00:05:08.821 --> 00:05:11.100
Japanese people, which are, you know.

102
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.370
<v 1>If you could get a Japanese girlfriend every day is a language lesson.</v>

103
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.060
What if they speak fluent English? Well, I screen.

104
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.260
<v 0>He's just going to be speaking English. Right?</v>

105
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.680
Would you not find the communication would be an issue if you could?

106
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.510
<v 1>Well, I dated the Japanese go East of arguments. I just didn't know what were,</v>

107
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.550
what was going on English angry. She didn't speak English very well.

108
00:05:32.551 --> 00:05:33.930
I didn't speak Japanese very well at the time.

109
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.590
Didn't know what we were arguing about because we just had your phones out with

110
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:37.443
Google translate. Yeah.

111
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.460
<v 0>Cause when you, when you think about it, when you think about it English,</v>

112
00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:45.900
we have so many ways to convey levels of upset that are so precise.

113
00:05:45.901 --> 00:05:50.640
I feel that it's almost like impossible to translate that to a non native

114
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:51.270
speaker.

115
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.750
<v 1>I mean, it's, you know, it's the whole idea of like the word, right?</v>

116
00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.110
Like that can be used in literally any emotion, but trying to, I had to,

117
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.390
I had to explain that to one of my Japanese friends,

118
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.300
because he had heard of that word before, but he was like,

119
00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:06.350
what does that actually mean?

120
00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.820
<v 0>Well, it's kind of use your imagination.</v>

121
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.300
<v 1>I said it, it can mean anything. He was like, what, what does that mean?</v>

122
00:06:13.301 --> 00:06:15.670
My experience teaching my Japanese friends word. It's dangerous.

123
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:16.683
Cause they'll just use it.

124
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.280
<v 0>Yeah. [inaudible]</v>

125
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.280
Amanda Love hotel when he referred to it as a scary point. Um,

126
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.770
but the thing is he would be completely corrected.

127
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:36.550
He was trying to say was, this is a scary place. Scary, scary.

128
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.520
There's some reason why I've been meeting Japanese people online or video games.

129
00:06:42.521 --> 00:06:45.790
They seem to only know the worst words. Like for one,

130
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.490
this one guy kept telling me he had a Magnum chin, chin.

131
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.370
And I was like, how do you know what the word Magnum?

132
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.770
How would you know who taught you this? Ooh, how do you find this out?

133
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.780
I love how he knows the one Magnum.

134
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.800
It was just the, yeah. The daikon Magnum chin chin. It was so strange.

135
00:07:11.801 --> 00:07:12.970
It sounds like a rockstar

136
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.310
rock Magnum mochi, Jim. It was great.

137
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.720
It asks me about my Dick size live on stream and I'm like,

138
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.100
are you sure you want to? Okay.

139
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.520
Because sports good sports. It's so good. I learned that there's also, uh,

140
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:35.230
they have, uh, a term and gaming in Japan where they have real tamale.

141
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.710
Yeah. So when you, when you game online with people,

142
00:07:38.711 --> 00:07:42.070
they're not the real friends. Right? When sometimes if you're busy, you're like,

143
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.330
Oh, I'm playing with real tamale.

144
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.480
[inaudible] is like the equivalent of like IRR. Yeah. Which is like funny.

145
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:53.560
Cause it's like, you're not real, real interesting. My gaming friends.

146
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:55.620
I've I've I've been learning a lot. Yeah.

147
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.450
<v 1>During that. Yeah. There's a, there's a lot of like Japanese,</v>

148
00:07:58.451 --> 00:08:00.860
I guess like internet slang. You'll learn from playing with.

149
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.760
<v 0>Japanese. Yeah. Luckily I've been playing with one guy and he's been,</v>

150
00:08:03.761 --> 00:08:06.250
he's been figuring out how to like dumb things down for me,

151
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.680
which is good because sometimes he talks too fast.

152
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:13.720
Like throwing out like two channel lingo. They never use like, like any, uh,

153
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.970
they always use like plain form and stuff like that.

154
00:08:15.971 --> 00:08:20.110
And for a lot me to like this isn't all of my classes. What's all this nonsense.

155
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.760
Where is the [inaudible] what's up?

156
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:25.990
What's going on here?

157
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:33.520
I feel like what Tashi? Why's the biggest lie you learn once you Illingworth.

158
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:36.320
Nobody says that. Um, Duolingo, it,

159
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:38.950
it constantly throws what Tashi nonstop at you.

160
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.630
And then the first thing you learn, right?

161
00:08:40.631 --> 00:08:43.150
Every Japanese textbook in every classroom.

162
00:08:43.151 --> 00:08:45.430
And then you talk to them and you're like, so that was a lie.

163
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.960
<v 1>And he messaged me every everyday saying they've learned Japanese from Duolingo.</v>

164
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.850
It doesn't prepare you for Japanese. Do you really know?

165
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:56.170
<v 0>It's quite fun. But like, it way prepare you on the mini game. It is,</v>

166
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:00.570
it helps with vocab, but that's also as far as it goes.

167
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:05.130
But even then I cause sometimes Duolingo will try and teach you Kanji before

168
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:08.370
it's even taught you all the Huracan and Casco, which blows my mind.

169
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:10.501
Same did do that.

170
00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:13.680
I think we've talked about like teaching you like algebra before you've learned

171
00:09:13.681 --> 00:09:15.300
multiplication, right? It's like why?

172
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.290
<v 1>Yeah. Julie goes, all right, but like human, Japanese really good app.</v>

173
00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:20.090
I recommend it is paid for,

174
00:09:20.091 --> 00:09:23.690
but it's like a free light version paying for an app. If it actually is good.

175
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.690
It is really, I used it that first year, human, Japanese, human, Japanese,

176
00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:29.030
intermediate, everyone I've recommended to loves it.

177
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.330
So if you're learning Japanese, you're like really starting tomorrow afternoon,

178
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.380
human Japanese,

179
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.550
amazing to recommend the Yankee textbooks they get after like you've done

180
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:42.290
Japanese studying for like six Japanese. You've started studying tomorrow.

181
00:09:42.291 --> 00:09:43.040
You're coming to Japan.

182
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.890
That is the app you get kind of really helped me in my first year,

183
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.730
coming here as a teacher, I recommend it. Not sponsored, not sponsored.
