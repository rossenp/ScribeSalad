1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.590
<v 0>You do think that what's your opinion about like older animate, uh,</v>

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.080
older animate versus like newer digitized anime?

3
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.450
<v 1>Oh yeah. Um, well, digital mission, uh,</v>

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.830
is, uh,

5
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.960
you can get quicker because we can walk at your place and the send by mail or

6
00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:22.640
the, the, the datas, it's not paper. You don't have to scan it. Uh,

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.410
but, uh, uh, the program of a Steeler and an emission industry,

8
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.150
they must have, like I said, [inaudible], uh,

9
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.150
animation director. Most of them are on paper. So, because

10
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.150
 they've been in the industry for so long, so long and you date, they would like to learn some digital 

11
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.983
and mentioned budget. Don't have the time of, yeah, we'll say Don [inaudible]

12
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.030
10 years and dies. Or.

13
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.310
<v 0>I learned animation on paper. I won't die.</v>

14
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.050
<v 1>Some of my senpai have tried to learn a digital emission,</v>

15
00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:07.850
but he was too much stress is that you have a pain and stomach to go to.

16
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.880
<v 0>Must be God,</v>

17
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.140
it's horrible basis. I have to love that. So.

18
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.640
<v 1>Uh, also, yeah, more so me, I'm doing digital. Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.690
And so I'm doing my layout in digital, so, but if the second have to check it,

20
00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:31.050
put correction, they have to print it and write. So yeah.

21
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.250
<v 0>But I'm doing it, then fax it back to you. Right.</v>

22
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.060
So that was a joke. That's a joke.

23
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.570
I was joking because yeah. They have a paper,

24
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.850
none of that, sorry. [inaudible].

25
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.980
<v 1>Uh, by your data and to, for me to doing it digitally. So yeah.</v>

26
00:01:57.981 --> 00:02:02.630
So most amazing man. Now, most of the enriching, uh, uh, digital,

27
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.230
but, uh, it depends. Uh, so digital and paper are a bit, uh,

28
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.910
I think more, in fact, a veterans, a good animators,

29
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.650
that's still on paper and right nowadays some young are more on digital, but,

30
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.930
uh, the program is software. You have to pay it. And, um,

31
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.510
most of the such software expensive commercial licenses are very expensive

32
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.070
and also, you know,

33
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:33.050
how much animators have paid so they can say, yeah,

34
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.180
he's good. Softer, like TV pain too, but too expensive. So,

35
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.703
uh, yeah, so.

36
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.460
<v 0>I can't,</v>

37
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.360
I can't believe the software's like too expensive for the people who are going

38
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.750
to use it for the people who are going to use the software,

39
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.550
what he was designed to do. Sorry, man, we want to pay you more,

40
00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:55.880
but Photoshop is like 600 bucks a month.

41
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.700
So it's kind of expensive fun. Now, young animators.

42
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.710
<v 1>Are walking on blender because Brenda is free, free,</v>

43
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.790
and you can do 3d and 2d animation at the same time. And I see.

44
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.170
<v 0>So I thought that was just a meme. So, so people in the army industry,</v>

45
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.333
Archer using blender.

46
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.090
<v 1>Uh, some of them not to everybody, but uh, uh.</v>

47
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.090
<v 0>Cause it's like a meme now whenever we see something bad, that is like, Oh,</v>

48
00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:27.300
this looks like it was animated in blender. Think wasn't any,

49
00:03:27.301 --> 00:03:28.410
any reality to that

50
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.570
slowly, closest blender.

51
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.770
<v 1>Yeah. I, in fact it was just stuff doesn't um, it doesn't the big point. Uh,</v>

52
00:03:40.771 --> 00:03:45.000
if you put it, uh, has a still on like a paper. Yeah.

53
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.570
Because what's the question would be on paper, on digital,

54
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.110
but because each you, if it's on G Pega,

55
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.170
every soft can open a G big. Yeah. Yeah.

56
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.560
<v 0>I am curious being an animator because like we do,</v>

57
00:03:58.561 --> 00:04:00.630
we do anime videos on YouTube and talk about anime.

58
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.550
And as someone who watches anime as a job, I cannot like,

59
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.870
I still enjoy anime, but I can't enjoy anime the same way I used to as a kid,

60
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.910
as someone who actually works on anime,

61
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.110
has it changed your view of anime at all and how you watch it and everything

62
00:04:16.111 --> 00:04:16.740
like that.

63
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.880
<v 1>Actuary I'm from some of my friends nowadays watch less and less</v>

64
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.350
animation and going into are more critics. Right.

65
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.870
<v 0>Right, right. But those tend to happen. Yeah.</v>

66
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.780
I can't imagine an animator casually sitting down to watch it.

67
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.900
I can't wait for my favorite season of seven deadly sins.

68
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.880
What did you think about that?

69
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.820
<v 1>Sorry. I just watched the first season, so.</v>

70
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.970
<v 0>Okay. Okay. Oh, have you seen pictures of season.</v>

71
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:45.803
<v 1>Three?</v>

72
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.080
<v 0>Do I need to ask your opinion or is it obvious? Yeah.</v>

73
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.250
I understand your feelings.
