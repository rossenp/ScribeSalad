1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.050
<v 0>Compared to other places, tourism in the UK, like within the shifts.</v>

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.160
<v 1>Just like non-existent, Butlins,</v>

3
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.660
that's all like you go to one city and it's like, okay, here's, here's a C.

4
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.780
And then you go to another city. It's exactly the opposite.

5
00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:17.720
Every Wetherspoons in the UK, like what are you going to do? The C Oh,

6
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.880
let's go to the pub. What were you going to do in Newcastle? Oh,

7
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.650
let's go to the pub. Where are you going to do in Liverpool? Oh,

8
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.290
let's go to the pub. You know, it's, it's, it's our, to be fair.

9
00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:25.124
That's me in Japan.

10
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.750
<v 0>But I mean,</v>

11
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.540
Japan has a really strong tourism ministry cause people don't want to travel

12
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:32.360
overseas a lot of the time. Yeah. There's quite a lot of population.

13
00:00:32.361 --> 00:00:35.690
Japan don't actually have passports and they don't have much time for holiday.

14
00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:38.660
Holiday leaves, really bad culture should have much choice.

15
00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:40.910
They do want to stay, just stay here and they travel the country.

16
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:43.970
So domestic tourism in Japan is really big business.

17
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.710
Each place has their own unique thing.

18
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.050
So you can sort of cross the border and be like, wow,

19
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.820
it's pretty different in the next kind of project.

20
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.810
<v 2>Yeah. I did notice when I stayed in the real con, but I parked, uh,</v>

21
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.750
and there was tons of cars. Um, I re I stayed two nights. Right.

22
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.930
But when I went that every single car in this car pocket left,

23
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.130
so clearly everyone was only staying one night, which was odd. You stay one day.

24
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.070
I've noticed that they stay one night and then they're like, but I was like, no,

25
00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:08.590
I want multiple days of this. You're kidding me.

26
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.400
And that's probably because like a lot of them, you know,

27
00:01:10.401 --> 00:01:14.600
with the whole world work culture thing, they just, one day more than two days.

28
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.240
<v 0>His off is like a luxury. Right. I read a statistic.</v>

29
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:20.240
The most people in Japan only take half their holiday leave at 20 days.

30
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.730
They only take 10 crazy. Why is that?

31
00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:25.160
Do you reckon that's a shame because your boss, your boss will be like,

32
00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:28.850
you've abandoned the team. How dare you? You know, it's pretty,

33
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.120
what then was a teacher? Like, it was, it was pretty, can be quite stressful.

34
00:01:32.121 --> 00:01:34.610
Taking holiday leave even more ridiculous.

35
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.000
One time I took like three days off and they're like, okay,

36
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.100
I have to get it signed by a supervisor. And then the headmaster,

37
00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:43.790
the headmaster's mum they'll have to sign it. And then I decided, actually,

38
00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:46.790
I don't need that holiday. I'll just stay. And they got really angry. He's like,

39
00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:50.870
what do you want to stay? Now? Don't do this again. You don't have to do that.

40
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.130
And like, they really angry.

41
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.500
<v 1>I didn't really know why you come back.</v>

42
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.390
<v 0>And you have work work. Like it was like, your job is like, I don't know why.</v>

43
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.110
Maybe it's because they had to get teachers to look at like do my job for me.

44
00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:05.090
And they had to do sort of things, but I dunno,

45
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.310
but like taking holiday in Japan is not fun.

46
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.890
And you're lucky you worked for trash tastes as a result.

47
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.790
<v 1>Well, we don't want to, for trash tastes trash, trash,</v>

48
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.843
the system.

49
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.550
<v 0>Make a t-shirt. We are trash trash. I'm wearing the trash T's t-shirt.</v>

50
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.370
<v 1>I can remember working in the UK. I mean,</v>

51
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.790
you've you feel pressured to take all your holiday. They like, kind of like,

52
00:02:28.791 --> 00:02:33.110
if you have any holiday leave days left over, then that's like, well,

53
00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:34.940
you can take that out. It's just free time off.

54
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.940
Why are you not taking it right here? It's like the complete opposite.

55
00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:40.400
And I'm not sure if it's the same in other Asian countries.

56
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.630
I feel like it would be less of a pressure that is in Japan because

57
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.820
work culture in Japan is.

58
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.710
<v 0>It's just seen as let, letting down your team.</v>

59
00:02:48.711 --> 00:02:51.110
And if you do take a holiday leave, you're less likely to, you know,

60
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.810
get that promotion. If you need to work for my company,

61
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.320
you decided to take all your holiday, leave what you can legally be entitled to.

62
00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.660
But you don't, I'll be like, come on.

63
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.300
<v 1>Let's promote gum.</v>

64
00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.060
<v 0>Because Cola off the hook Hydo and ate some cramps. Didn't somebody.</v>

65
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.980
<v 2>Like a famous, uh, politician got like,</v>

66
00:03:07.981 --> 00:03:11.250
it was like newsworthy that he took maternity leave a man. Yeah.

67
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.130
Like it was new. It was newsworthy that the man took a week off.

68
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.433
He took his meds.

69
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.540
<v 1>Yeah. The man is entitled.</v>

70
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.570
<v 2>One week off. And it was, it was literally country news.</v>

71
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.600
<v 0>And he was allowed to, but again, most people don't in Japan.</v>

72
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.180
<v 2>Especially for maternity. I think they think that that's the mother's job.</v>

73
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.180
Right? Yeah. That's the thing. I feel Japan in a lot of senses,

74
00:03:30.181 --> 00:03:34.620
like the societal law, like almost exceeds the actual law, you know,

75
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.040
it's like five steps forward in technology. And then their cultures.

76
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.280
<v 0>It was like 50 steps back. Right? Hold up. Here's a fax machine.</v>

77
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.290
That's why we say to people coming to Japan to work, be careful where you work.

78
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.110
Um, foreign companies operating in Japan,

79
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.850
don't usually have those sort of rules and parameters. So that's always a bonus,

80
00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:55.590
but like be careful where you work.

81
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.440
Cause I know a lot of people that work in jobs, they don't get any free time.

82
00:03:58.441 --> 00:04:00.420
They're expected to go out and drink a lot after work.

83
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.930
There's no border between free time and work hard drinking all the time.

84
00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:04.764
Isn't it crazy.

85
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.710
<v 1>$12. Chris is just like, Oh, another, another night out. Really? Oh,</v>

86
00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:14.030
I guess in Japan. Do you have to like drink to show?

87
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.540
<v 0>No,</v>

88
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.300
it's kind of it's your boss will like open up and talk to you about things that

89
00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:23.370
they wouldn't normally do when they're sober in the office. Right. Even as a,

90
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.190
you know, working in a school, my teachers that I worked with,

91
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.280
but open up massively after one drink, they won't even be drunk.

92
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.730
It was almost like having alcohol would initiate, being able to be open.

93
00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:35.370
It's like being in that environment, opens them up.

94
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.370
And I had teaching colleagues. Who'd just be like, I hate that colleague.

95
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.270
I hate X, Y, Z. I hate them. And I'd be like, Oh, okay.

96
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.000
<v 1>Two beers. Maybe we shouldn't have had a drink.</v>

97
00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.260
<v 0>The flood Gates open. It's what a fascinating thing to experience.</v>

98
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.380
I love that two hours in we're finally starting to sound like an actual podcast.

99
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.220
<v 1>I still sleep blabbering and he still keep laughing intermittently because</v>

100
00:04:56.221 --> 00:04:59.790
seeing Connor die every time you take a sip of soccer, hilarious.

101
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.970
<v 0>Let's do it together. Come on, drink the whole thing. I've got a lot more.</v>

102
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.850
This is my second Glasscock off. Look at that. This is my second shot.

103
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.850
<v 1>You been having baby bird sips or that? Yeah.</v>

104
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.980
<v 0>All right. Cheers. Crushes.</v>

105
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.270
<v 2>Beautiful drink and beverage. I'm hope I don't throw up to see WEA.</v>

106
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.190
[inaudible] strange.

107
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.480
<v 1>Oh, he's actually Downing. Okay.</v>

108
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.970
I love the fact that this is going to be more and it's [inaudible] right.

109
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.720
<v 0>Never shot socket. It's not designed for that sash sash sash.</v>
