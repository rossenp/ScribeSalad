1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
<v 0>I do, I do want to know that as an animator,</v>

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.870
are there any like scenes or any animation cuts that you really look up to

3
00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:10.530
and you like idolize is legendary and have inspired you.

4
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.770
<v 1>Uh, like, uh, uh,</v>

5
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.680
you have a lot of animation of a wobble,

6
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.630
how he make this movement. Right. And so, yeah,

7
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.620
when you doing a frame pal frame on your animator, right?

8
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.500
Watch the movement. Okay. Oh, I just spent, Oh,

9
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.740
this just for me just expose at one, two. Oh,

10
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.440
this frame is of course a tree and all at this moment,

11
00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:41.090
you have the fire come here and there is a movement like that

12
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.310
frame by frame, every animators doing like that. And so, Oh,

13
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.140
so this is the key animation.

14
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.033
<v 0>Really slow.</v>

15
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.050
<v 1>She's a journeyman like everybody. Well, what was this moment?</v>

16
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.850
So I put a stop and Felbam from performance.

17
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.260
<v 0>I guess,</v>

18
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.740
I guess like an animator or I guess like director that comes to mind when it

19
00:01:03.741 --> 00:01:08.180
comes to like amazing animation will be like Satoshi call-in. Right. Like he,

20
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.130
you know, she, she, like, he managed to like animate in a way,

21
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.550
because I think I saw it in some kind of interview with him, like way before,

22
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.991
um, that, like,

23
00:01:17.991 --> 00:01:22.790
the reason why he went into animation was because his way of directing is too

24
00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:25.520
fast for live action. Yeah. So, whereas like,

25
00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:28.490
because there's so many cuts in con movies where it's just,

26
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:30.740
it's like a blink it's so fast,

27
00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:34.160
it's almost subliminal that you just can't replicate in live action.

28
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.030
And he's just, I don't know, like even I'm not an animator at all or anything,

29
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:40.850
but like you can watch a Satoshi con movie and be like,

30
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.790
how do you even like think to animate something like that?

31
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.920
<v 1>I have one of my senpai who had walked on a constitution movie. Uh, it was a,</v>

32
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.970
her the co-director of, uh, Tokyo. Good poser. His name is,

33
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.440
uh [inaudible] and, uh, yeah, you,

34
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.950
the con movies are very realistic, uh, realistic,

35
00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:07.580
but under war funds of character, the expression that

36
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.980
[inaudible]. So we mix up as a picture and [inaudible]

37
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.980
, You can watch it every time and

38
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.980
 you have a depression. Oh, Oh, you didn't just get teased

39
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.980
 with connect with. And, uh,

40
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.980
 and also like a Tokyo godfather, because I don't know

41
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:11.813
, it's a movie you want to watch it at Christmas? Yeah.

42
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.340
<v 0>It's one of the few Christmas anime movies.</v>

43
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.780
Not that it was meant to be a Christmas movie. It was just,

44
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.820
it just happens to be Christmas. Right.

45
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.990
<v 1>And, uh, yeah,</v>

46
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.720
but when my senpai said concert or she was one of the best

47
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.460
maybe best enemy. Oh yeah. It's free.

48
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.420
Or you Erie faster addiction in here have a perfect drawing.

49
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.660
<v 0>Yeah, because I think, I,</v>

50
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.640
I think I saw that like Satoshi Khan used to like draw some of his own

51
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:02.650
animations as well, because the key animator.

52
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.570
<v 1>He's, uh, he had done mangaka he? Yes, he was manga.</v>

53
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.370
He had to walk on a lot of [inaudible]. Yeah. And so, yeah. I don't know. He can

54
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.370
walk on Akira or not. I don't remember. But, uh,

55
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.370
 yes, he was very cross with automo, with a dozer generation of artists who was 

56
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.203
a lot of movie makers in Japan.

57
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.420
<v 0>Animator. What do you think of like a Kira for instance, like the animation.</v>

58
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.910
<v 1>Cura is amazing because I.</v>

59
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.270
<v 0>Feel that like, when, when people say Akira, they're just like, yeah,</v>

60
00:03:36.271 --> 00:03:39.600
this animation has an age. Like so well even, yeah.

61
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.310
<v 1>If you want to, if you want a better, uh, for animators,</v>

62
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.010
a good, uh, an emission you have, so, uh, general general,

63
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.680
I've heard, that's pretty lucky for my son back. He said that, uh,

64
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.820
general is to admission, realistic, most push extreme,

65
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.400
too much extreme that most of the animators is just a for musterbation of

66
00:04:02.401 --> 00:04:06.750
animation. It's too much,

67
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.900
but it's a good entertainment one.

68
00:04:09.901 --> 00:04:14.700
And with good animation or so very pushed was, uh, uh,

69
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.270
memories are the ultimate Katsura and you have the

70
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.110
[inaudible] of animation is a master cross because it's a,

71
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.640
most of the frames are, um, explosion or three,

72
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.710
three frame in less frame, but just good drawings, good timings.

73
00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:38.544
And.

74
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.510
<v 0>I'll stop. You may need a grocery if you don't know is like a space opera arc.</v>

75
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.710
Yeah. That's the only way to describe how old is it?

76
00:04:46.711 --> 00:04:51.120
It's like from the nineties, like late nineties, it was like,

77
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.950
it was quite a while after,

78
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.790
but it's like a magnetic Rose is like a short film that authorize your a

79
00:04:56.791 --> 00:05:01.080
directed 14 minutes. It's like a 40 minute like short film, but it's like, yeah,

80
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.130
it's basically just space. Opera. Opera is the only way to describe it,

81
00:05:05.131 --> 00:05:06.270
but it's amazing.

82
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.400
<v 1>Is this the same team that managed to cross? You have a [inaudible] run mirrors.</v>

83
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.150
Yeah. I didn't watch it, but I had watched some

84
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.920
[inaudible] very impressive. So, yeah. So.

85
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.850
<v 0>So I guess if you want to like, stop being animated, just study those, right.</v>

86
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:29.190
<v 1>This is the realest ones, the golden age of animators. Will you say that.</v>

87
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.730
<v 0>It's interesting hearing an actual opinion from an actual animator.</v>

88
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.120
Cause you know, it's, it's because, you know, when, whenever we think of like,

89
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.870
Oh, what do we think is the best animated, whatever of anime of all time.

90
00:05:39.871 --> 00:05:44.790
Like most people would say like red line probably is the one that comes to my

91
00:05:44.791 --> 00:05:45.210
mind.
