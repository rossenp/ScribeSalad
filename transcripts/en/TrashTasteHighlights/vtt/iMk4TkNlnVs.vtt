1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.940
<v 0>I do wanna mention while Joey's pulling out the first name that, uh, yeah, I, I,</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.250
this is my hidden animate list.

3
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.560
So I actually have one from when I was a teenager that I never made public and

4
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:08.910
people would always ask me for my animate list.

5
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:13.170
So I actually made a Miami list on the Seadog VA and just put like Bocchino.

6
00:00:13.171 --> 00:00:16.650
Pico is like a 10 and then every now and then I got a comment on it being like,

7
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.543
I hate you. Can't.

8
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.560
<v 1>Hi. Yeah, my, my username as well. I mean, I've done a video on it already,</v>

9
00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:24.440
so people know, but it's like, my username is not even the anime man.

10
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.040
It was a blast for me. It was the username I used before. I was the anime man.

11
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.960
Zinger. What are you a big boy? Where did that go? Oh,

12
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.350
because my son is busy. And is it like big bang theory now?

13
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.600
Bazinga bet. He's never heard that one.

14
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.240
Never heard of that one Bible Christ.

15
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.920
You just mean the like fingering of that for the first one is, Oh, it's me.

16
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.930
All right. Fantastic. Right. Let's check out the zingers. Okay.

17
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.960
So first thing I got to ask is how,

18
00:00:56.961 --> 00:01:01.160
when was the last time you remember updating this? Cause like, like,

19
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.040
I'm going to say this now. We're all picking up our mouse.

20
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.450
I haven't updated my mouse in years. Okay. I'll give you, I'll give you an idea.

21
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.060
All right. I'm looking at my watching list right now.

22
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.020
And a book in a hero academia. Second season is on you. You've got,

23
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:15.854
you've got a.

24
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.530
<v 0>31 Days here and that was like, well, 34 years ago.</v>

25
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.120
Now I've already finished that one though. That's like, well,

26
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:23.960
how long ago was that kind of 91 days? No.

27
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.070
<v 1>When did season two of my hero come out? Like two years ago? Two years ago.</v>

28
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.800
It was two years ago. No, it wasn't two minutes.

29
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.880
It was like three guys realized that boomers

30
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.960
four years ago, four years ago. So it's been that long since I've updated it.

31
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.850
Right. Okay. So wait, wait. You're telling me,

32
00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:45.680
you've watched my hero academia season one. I think she's won. Yeah. However,

33
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.660
you've like, never talked about this before.

34
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.100
Cause it was like the most successful,

35
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.090
but you you'd normally milk that for all it's worth. You're like,

36
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:57.680
yo it's mid bro. I'm triggering all the little weaves on there. Good.

37
00:01:57.681 --> 00:02:01.670
But also it's like, I don't know. To me like calling Mike,

38
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.810
your academia med is just as much of a popular opinion as saying that it's a 10

39
00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:09.300
out of 10, the first thing that pops out, somebody on base,

40
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.010
but you gave it a seven out of 10. It's all right.

41
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.200
It was good.

42
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.950
It wasn't like the second coming of Jesus that people got the wrong guy.

43
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.830
The first thing that pops out to me here, right?

44
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.020
The first thing that pops out to me here as, as like,

45
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.760
this is how I know Joey's is my brethren here. Right. Because as we all know,

46
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:29.690
my,

47
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.550
I started as the animal's own and my very first anime zone

48
00:02:34.551 --> 00:02:37.400
review was bleach. Yeah.

49
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.070
Which I gave a seven.

50
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.080
I can see that Mr. Joey, the anime man, or let's say

51
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.480
a seven out of 10. I mean,

52
00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:55.370
despite the fact how much we've on fleet and unlike the professional career

53
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.650
look, look, look, when I, when I on bleach, right? I mean, granted,

54
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.530
I've never really like publicly on bleach all that much. Right?

55
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.180
Like I didn't make like a enemies on a review on blue tray, but look,

56
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:12.130
the only thing it's three points off for the Eisenach and then everything else

57
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:16.150
was perfect. You know what I mean? Like that's, I mean, I w I mean,

58
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:19.900
I would argue everything off is so sole society. I mean, you can, like,

59
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:20.763
you can like the.

60
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.820
<v 0>The Aaron car or whatever. Of course.</v>

61
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.970
<v 1>The wake up window walk was fine as well. It was fine.</v>

62
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.230
<v 0>I watched all red bleed. Really. You don't, you don't need to.</v>

63
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.150
<v 1>And if you do just read or watch up to Saul society, which is the first doc,</v>

64
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.750
which is whatever.

65
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.940
<v 0>But you can't just stop if you're like, really?</v>

66
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.330
You can't just though you want to start to see it go down.

67
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.540
<v 1>I mean, I mean, it's, it depends like, because bleach.</v>

68
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.860
<v 0>Well, didn't go out with a bang. It just, it just like kind of fizzle towel,</v>

69
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.020
all like reviews of bleach.

70
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.170
For some reason I've watched like every eyepatch Wolfe video on it and I'm like,

71
00:03:55.171 --> 00:03:57.540
yeah, cool. This sounds good. Sounds good.

72
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.870
<v 1>Don't get me wrong. It was back in the day when it was serializing,</v>

73
00:04:00.871 --> 00:04:04.740
it was a super solid show in, in Mongo. And like, you know,

74
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.080
as much as I like to think that I'm like, Oh, you know,

75
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.640
I like all the underground, like weird non-mainstream. Yeah. I love my show.

76
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.520
And then, and bleach was one of them, like all society Oak was on, honestly,

77
00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:15.151
to this day.

78
00:04:15.151 --> 00:04:19.830
I think bleach is one of just the coolest animation to come out.

79
00:04:19.831 --> 00:04:21.210
Like it Def definitely. I like.

80
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.680
<v 0>Out of the big three, which is like one piece narrative and bleach.</v>

81
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.930
<v 1>Bleach was just like that cool kid.</v>

82
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.300
<v 0>You know what I mean? It always seemed like the edgiest one.</v>

83
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.680
It was definitely the edgiest. Yeah.

84
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.400
<v 1>Have you seen what Cooper tighter? It looks like, it looks like.</v>

85
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:37.980
<v 0>AMVs, there's always Lincoln park.</v>

86
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.440
<v 1>I mean, that was pretty much.</v>

87
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.640
<v 0>Bleach. Yeah. But it wasn't like, it went better with like bleach.</v>

88
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.593
Cause they had like half.

89
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.390
<v 1>Bowls and. I don't know what's going on with this dude.</v>

90
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.810
Like the powers was sick. It was just, it was just the solar pals of steak.

91
00:04:51.811 --> 00:04:56.130
Then like, I want to see some mobile guys got damaged by Kubo,

92
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.830
but like he, he has a good fashion sense. Oh yeah.

93
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.710
The way he dressed the characters, they would, they just always looked cool.

94
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.280
The group was clean. He wasn't perfect way to decide characters.

95
00:05:08.281 --> 00:05:12.000
The drip was clean, like say what you want about bleach. They had those carrots.

96
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.440
I wouldn't go as far as to say that bleach might be maybe not the first,

97
00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:20.970
but definitely one of the biggest shows that kind of gave like, I dunno,

98
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.450
I don't know. Maybe it's streetwear and animals like collaborations.

99
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.140
I would argue, maybe came from bleach because a lot of the characters,

100
00:05:28.141 --> 00:05:31.800
especially in like the title, um, channels that he wrote during the manga,

101
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.500
like he gave them such cool, looking straight,

102
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.040
but honestly you can see people wearing like this is to see.

103
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.260
<v 0>Why go drip. Goku exists.</v>

104
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.923
<v 1>Bleeds is the reason like,</v>

105
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:53.220
[inaudible], I'll show you, but like it's

106
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.053
, it's this meme of like Goku, like in the b-boy stance wearing this drip.

107
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.710
<v 0>A big beam right down. I don't know why this is a meme.</v>

108
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.770
I try to explain it to some people. And they're like, but why is it to me?

109
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.693
And I'm like, I don't know.

110
00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:12.280
<v 1>But the droop is clean. What is going back to drag them?</v>

111
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.810
Fans? What is dragon ball memes, man, this darn Twitter. I don't know.

112
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.360
It's just like drip, drip coat.

113
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.310
And then Virgina wearing like the Supreme light sweater.

114
00:06:24.311 --> 00:06:27.050
As always as being like it's clean.

115
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.680
<v 0>Go cook on drift. Apparently that's trooper. Um,</v>

116
00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:32.050
there would be no drip Gokey without drip bleach.

117
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.440
<v 1>If it wasn't for bleach, that'd be nice. I feel like every kind.</v>

118
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.750
<v 0>Of draggable meme under the sun has just been like.</v>

119
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.040
<v 1>Every cancerous meme and like literally cancerous.</v>

120
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.590
<v 0>In terms of the dragon bowl. Um, communities get lost for words.</v>

121
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.370
<v 1>I'm surprised. You've never seen it. It's all over Twitter.</v>
