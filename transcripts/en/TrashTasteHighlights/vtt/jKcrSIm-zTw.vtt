00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.380
<v 0>Welcome to this episode of trash taste. I am the boy, the big boy. And with me,</v>

2
00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:08.580
I have big boy youngest and small boy Chagas. Wow.

3
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.070
<v 1>Why am I suddenly the fattest one here? [inaudible].</v>

4
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.500
<v 0>I haven't seen either of you at the gym lately.</v>

5
00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:17.030
I don't know what's been going on with that, but you know,

6
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.103
I'm very disappointed.

7
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.050
<v 1>One, they got a C in cholesterol are so late.</v>

8
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.170
[inaudible] on that. I want it to open up that cause you know what I was, I was,

9
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.070
I was seeing my usual trash tastes, um,

10
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.490
schedule and a on the toilet literally before recording got to get a,

11
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.910
get a phone call from Sydney and she said, Oh, I finally get my health,

12
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.700
health results back in. I'm like, congratulations. What'd you get Sydney.

13
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.590
And she got all A's and I'm like, cough, Sydney,

14
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.180
off. You got all A's.

15
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.230
So how was it that she gets all A's and yet I got a C on my liver.

16
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.060
I'm probably the one out of the foremost who drinks the least. Okay. Okay. So,

17
00:00:56.061 --> 00:00:58.940
so to give context of this conversation. So a few weeks ago,

18
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.530
if you have regular trash tastes viewer,

19
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.490
you would know that we had our biannual annual health check annual

20
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.830
health check. Yeah. And.

21
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.560
<v 0>Just something that a Japanese company forces every employee to do,</v>

22
00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:12.350
they have to go for a checkup and the company also gets the results. Yeah.

23
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.510
<v 1>Yes. And so we did, we did our health checkup a few weeks ago.</v>

24
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.950
We talked about it on trash taste and we just got our results back.

25
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.000
And this is the first time I've ever gotten results back from like, uh,

26
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.810
you know, getting my health checkup in a foreign company, a country. Sorry.

27
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.280
And I did not know that you get graded. I'm used to seeing numbers.

28
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.410
<v 0>And them saying like, Oh, this is bad. I'm like, Oh, wow.</v>

29
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.010
<v 1>I mean, it's just a funny number, isn't it? Yeah, no, no, it literally,</v>

30
00:01:37.011 --> 00:01:39.290
I got my health checkup and I'm just like, wait,

31
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.920
they are literally grading you ABC. Like it's like an end of year score report.

32
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.360
I felt like I was doing my GCSE is again, or Hey levels, Mike, my God.

33
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.100
And normally I don't really care too much about my health checkup because I've

34
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.370
done it. This is bad. Right. You see numbers, you see, you know,

35
00:01:55.371 --> 00:01:57.650
you see the doctor's suggestions and they're,

36
00:01:57.651 --> 00:02:00.740
they're just that they're doctors just suggestions. But I don't know why.

37
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.630
I think it's seeing,

38
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.870
seeing my health being graded like a school test.

39
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.850
It just brought the Asian blood out.

40
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.880
<v 0>Yeah. I definitely felt more competitive.</v>

41
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.920
<v 1>Yeah. My body.</v>

42
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.310
Cause I was going through my health checkup and overall I got a B,

43
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.940
so I was like, okay, I am a straight a student. What is,

44
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.080
what the did I do wrong? I'll be an Asian. There is no, no dead

45
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.650
B means bad dead.

46
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.600
The first thing I did when I got my results was I phoned up my mom and

47
00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:36.020
told her that and told her how well I scored in this exam.

48
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.940
<v 0>I called up the doctor and I was like, just to check this wasn't ranked, was it?</v>

49
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.790
This was, this is casual. This is free play. Right. Please say,

50
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.230
please say this society let's say no, but I, yeah. So I mean, my results,

51
00:02:48.231 --> 00:02:49.790
I got like all A's, which is great.

52
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.250
I should expect from someone who is under the age of 30,

53
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.360
you're generally supposed to be quite healthy, but I got it. I got to be on BMI.

54
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.920
Which, I mean, obviously I'm built a little different. Yeah.

55
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.230
And this is Japanese BMI, which I believe is slightly different.

56
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:05.140
I don't know if I'm, if I'm led to believe. That's correct, but yes, but I mean,

57
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.200
BMI is anyway, all of the, this is a hundred percent muscle,

58
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:11.740
not fat don't have me. And they got a C on my cholesterol,

59
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.870
but I got, I got like a, well, I'm not sure how cholesterol work exactly.

60
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.800
Because I don't know I'm dumb. Um, but one of, so there was like,

61
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.380
they'll have like three different collaterals and all of them were like a

62
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:27.700
little, you know, all the mechanics out of touch. Right. Um,

63
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.320
but I was like, in my head, I'm like, well,

64
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:31.390
they gave me three CS now for my cholesterol. I'm like,

65
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.600
but what are the odds of one of these cholesterol being good and the others not

66
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:37.720
being good? You know what I mean? If I got amazing cholesterol, the other two,

67
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.260
I'm going to be like, well. I mean, well, we're going to pick it up. I mean,

68
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:42.220
I don't know to me it was odd.

69
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.490
<v 1>That was worse because I got to see my liver and I think a B on my heart rate</v>

70
00:03:47.491 --> 00:03:51.150
monitoring or something and everything else was an a, does that mean

71
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.880
it's a, usually on your thing,

72
00:03:53.881 --> 00:03:57.210
like I think YouTube got like a doctor's like note, right? Or like a doc.

73
00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.130
Did you guys get a doc? So you can ask.

74
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.440
<v 0>When you get the thing. I don't know if you said yes or no,</v>

75
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.380
you can ask if you want advice. And I said, no, I don't want.

76
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.650
<v 1>I said no, but I still got like, I've got,</v>

77
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.690
I don't know if it's the same Dr. Snyder we're talking about,

78
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.690
but it was just like a summation of the test results.

79
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.170
We should just explain anything. No, it didn't. It just said, um,

80
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.440
some of the values are a bit, you know, abnormal, which is, you know,

81
00:04:19.441 --> 00:04:20.940
a higher or lower than we expect,

82
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.970
but there shouldn't be anything to worry about. I didn't even get a summation.

83
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.690
Did you know?

84
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.670
My literally like overall I got a C and the summation box was just blank.

85
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.500
I was like, Oh, you're just going to tell me that my liver is bad.

86
00:04:34.501 --> 00:04:38.160
And that's it. I feel like content context would help.

87
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.410
Did you have to get,

88
00:04:40.411 --> 00:04:42.620
did you get a note that said you had to come in three months later?

89
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.290
<v 0>Well, like I got that. They told me back in three months, but I don't, I don't,</v>

90
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.183
but it's optional.

91
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.220
<v 1>On the thing. It says, like, if you get a seed,</v>

92
00:04:49.221 --> 00:04:51.090
they recommend you come back three months later,

93
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.510
but I didn't get like a note saying that I should come back to mindset.

94
00:04:54.511 --> 00:04:55.510
You should come back and do that.

95
00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.010
<v 0>I have to pay for it. And also, you know,</v>

96
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.550
for cholesterol that he's obviously going to turn up and they're going to be

97
00:05:02.551 --> 00:05:04.890
like, Hey, you should, uh, exercise and eat healthy. I'm like.

98
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.320
<v 1>Thanks dog. I was going to ask. Cause I heard,</v>

99
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.170
I heard your back when the chicken and broccoli diets. No, I haven't.

100
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.303
<v 0>Back to the chicken and broccoli.</v>

101
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.640
I have started eating a little more health conscious because of the test

102
00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:17.970
results. I think it helped, helped me be a bit more conscious. It made me,

103
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.850
you know, when you would,

104
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.870
you would maybe just go for the game or you would go for the chips and maybe be

105
00:05:21.871 --> 00:05:23.370
a little like second thing. Like.

106
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.480
<v 1>I mean, I, I definitely have like stopped drinking. So I think,</v>

107
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.510
I think I've only drank like once or twice a.

108
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.350
<v 0>Is, is, is the liver a hundred percent, all problems come from alcoholics?</v>

109
00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:35.160
I feel like it's not just.

110
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.460
<v 1>Probably going to be a whole host of,</v>

111
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.320
cause the problem with the test results is that they, they gave,

112
00:05:40.321 --> 00:05:42.990
they gave you the grade, but they didn't tell you how to improve it.

113
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.250
And I guess, I guess that was all bad.

114
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.880
Cause we literally tick the box that said we don't want doctor's advice because

115
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.870
I had assumed like any other health checkup that it would just be like,

116
00:05:51.871 --> 00:05:55.020
you know, you're gonna be good. Right. It was just like the generic, you know,

117
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:56.020
are you doing well?

118
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.760
Do I need to go to the hospital to really have a whole lifestyle change? No,

119
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.600
but as soon as I saw the bee, cause I got a,

120
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.770
I got a B in my blood and I'm just like, how the do I improve my blood?

121
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.940
What am I doing wrong? Why is my blood a B just improve your Nan?

122
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.660
Just like control. Like, cause they, they were like, they were like, go on like,

123
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.830
you know, the white blood was T-cell I don't, I'm not a nut.

124
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.850
<v 0>I, I still don't know because I was like, I'm going to be yes.</v>

125
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.330
<v 1>Yeah. I saw the beat and I'm just like, as, as, as an agency don't, you know,</v>

126
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.520
cause whenever I saw it being a test, I'm like, okay,

127
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.340
I can improve this test score. I can study a bit more.

128
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.900
I can optimize this a bit more.

129
00:06:31.901 --> 00:06:36.550
Somehow what I found interesting was that like I always thought to myself that I

130
00:06:36.551 --> 00:06:39.310
was very deaf for my age because you know,

131
00:06:39.311 --> 00:06:41.290
I went to like a lot of concerts growing up and just,

132
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.320
basically destroyed my Easter, like headphones and like that.

133
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.490
But so I was expecting like on the hearing part that maybe get like a B or

134
00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:50.140
something. Right. I wouldn't even have complained about it.

135
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:54.520
But then I saw I got an a yeah. So I was like, Oh, it's not that I'm deaf.

136
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:55.600
It's just that I don't listen.

137
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.000
[inaudible] realize. I was like, okay, I'm glad to know.

138
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.240
I don't have a hearing problem. I just have like an attention problem.

139
00:07:07.241 --> 00:07:09.850
I just don't give a. That's my fault.

140
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.070
<v 0>I was telling, I was telling the company, I was like, listen, if,</v>

141
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.460
if my eyesight or my ears come back. I know exactly why that is.

142
00:07:15.461 --> 00:07:17.680
And that's because I didn't know what the was happening when they were talking

143
00:07:17.681 --> 00:07:22.030
to put the headphones on me. I'm like, wait, what? Wait, Whoa. They were like,

144
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.550
can you, then she asked me, luckily I just called her asking,

145
00:07:24.551 --> 00:07:26.710
can you hear in Japanese? Like, can you hear it? And I'm like.

146
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.740
<v 1>He'll walk. What am I listening for? And then I realized.</v>

147
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.670
<v 0>Because I had done the human benchmark tests recently that it was the frequency</v>

148
00:07:33.671 --> 00:07:37.180
thing to hear it. But I was like, what do you, what do you mean? Like,

149
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.770
what am I hearing for like a book? Like what?

150
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.780
<v 1>I didn't know where it was happening. I say thing. Right?</v>

151
00:07:43.781 --> 00:07:47.240
You have to do like the it's like a circle cut out, right? Yeah.

152
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:51.070
I did you guys say that in English? No. I said it in Japanese just point.

153
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:54.330
Oh really? I cause I,

154
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:58.510
I really up in the eyesight thing because I didn't know what they were looking

155
00:07:58.511 --> 00:07:59.020
for.

156
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.690
So I thought it was like a normal eyesight test thing where now when I was just

157
00:08:01.691 --> 00:08:06.580
like, Oh, E because, because, okay, so to explain the eyesight thing,

158
00:08:06.581 --> 00:08:09.460
they have this circle and have like one of like either up,

159
00:08:09.461 --> 00:08:13.780
down left or right that's cartel and the diagonals as well. Water cut out.

160
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.700
<v 0>I didn't see diagonals. I didn't see.</v>

161
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:22.390
<v 1>No, no, no. I only saw up down there for all of them, right? Yeah, I did too.</v>

162
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.230
But there was diagonal. There was no, there was no, I, they gave me,

163
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.230
they usually have diagonals. Right. I've never seen.

164
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.600
<v 0>I knew about this task just because when I exchanged my driving license from</v>

165
00:08:34.601 --> 00:08:37.900
British to Japanese, I have to do the exact same thing. Right. And I was just,

166
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.320
it was this exact same thing again. And there was no diagonals.

167
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.650
<v 1>I mean, I definitely got a ride cause I came back with like a 1.2 eyes.</v>

168
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:52.330
No, because right next to the circle thing, you had like the letters as well.

169
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.640
So I was just reading out letters when they were asking what direction I would

170
00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:58.200
have said what's missing from this

171
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.290
because I was wondering why she was looking at me really weird. I'm just like,

172
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.500
and she kept asking me, can you see? Can you see? And I'm just like, yeah, yeah,

173
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:12.370
yeah. Let me just read out the letters. [inaudible].

174
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.490
<v 0>Yeah. Luckily I had done the simulation before,</v>

175
00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.100
so that's why I was not panicking as much, but yeah man,

176
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.820
I mean I clicked no to the health advice cause I just figured that it was going

177
00:09:22.821 --> 00:09:27.110
to be the same old, you know, eat healthy because let's be honest. Right.

178
00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.560
If it's, if it's, unless it's something, you know, bad, like really bad,

179
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.710
that actually requires treatment. Right. They're just going to tell me, Hey,

180
00:09:33.711 --> 00:09:37.580
you should exercise more and eat healthy. You. I do most of that anyway. Yeah.

181
00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.670
<v 1>Because I mean like I think for cholesterol, it's pretty simple.</v>

182
00:09:40.671 --> 00:09:45.260
It's pretty simple. But for some of them, like for example, liver or blood,

183
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.060
you look at that with a little yikes.

184
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.220
<v 0>It's like a number of factors, right?</v>

185
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.660
<v 1>It's like, what do you want to start with? How do I,</v>

186
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.440
how do I improve my white blood cell count? I don't know. Do I,

187
00:09:53.441 --> 00:09:56.840
do I just take an injection of white blood cells? Well,

188
00:09:56.841 --> 00:09:57.950
what'd you what'd you want me to do.

189
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:00.860
<v 0>I have a theory, right? This, this is, this could be a very, uh,</v>

190
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.620
pleasant theory. I don't know. I, I,

191
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:05.930
my theory was cause we got the health checkup done right after like Christmas.

192
00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:06.890
And my theory was, well,

193
00:10:06.891 --> 00:10:09.560
I just been drinking and eating straight for like three weeks.

194
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.990
This is just clean. We've got to write this off. This is,

195
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.090
of course my collateral is going to be higher.

196
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.690
I had like 8,000 calories three days ago. Of course it's going to be higher.

197
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:23.480
Maybe. I don't know. I have to drink a lot in Christmas. So yeah.

198
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.050
So much. Yeah. Yeah.

199
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.320
<v 1>I think I definitely skewed the results.</v>

200
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.480
That's that's what I'm going to chalk it down to.

201
00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:36.410
<v 0>[Inaudible] please validate me in the comments. I don't want,</v>

202
00:10:36.411 --> 00:10:38.480
I don't want to hear it. If you have an alternative theory, just say.

203
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.130
<v 1>Yeah, I just found, I just found it funny how, like, I think it's, I think it's,</v>

204
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:43.821
this is different.

205
00:10:43.821 --> 00:10:47.780
Definitely the difference between like Asian culture and like Western culture

206
00:10:47.781 --> 00:10:49.400
where I feel like in Asia, living in Asia,

207
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:53.360
they try to make everything a test and everything kind of competitive.

208
00:10:53.361 --> 00:10:58.280
And that's just, I that's how I was raised as well. So whenever I see a grade,

209
00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:03.170
I like something in my blood drives me to try and improve that grades. Yeah.

210
00:11:03.171 --> 00:11:07.070
That's true. Yeah. And I don't know if I'm just like over competitive or I just,

211
00:11:07.071 --> 00:11:07.904
maybe.

212
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.250
<v 0>I think it's good, right? Because if you're the kind of person who you are.</v>

213
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.140
Yeah. Those, those things worked really well,

214
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:15.710
but there's obviously some personalities out there that when they hear, Oh,

215
00:11:15.711 --> 00:11:18.560
by the way, like you'll be a mice battery live is bad where they just like,

216
00:11:18.561 --> 00:11:20.930
instead of like wanting to be like, well you, I'm going to improve it.

217
00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:24.410
It's like, Oh. I guess it's just like, there's no hope. Like why,

218
00:11:24.411 --> 00:11:26.600
why is it like working? And then he should make it worse. Right?

219
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:31.010
<v 1>Yeah. But I dunno. I feel like as, as you know, as someone who grew up in,</v>

220
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.690
you know, kind of, kind of both cultures,

221
00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:37.640
I think a lot of toxicity can come and putting so much value into a

222
00:11:37.641 --> 00:11:40.340
grade or a test. And I feel like definitely living in Asia,

223
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:44.600
they put way too much value into test results and score results.

224
00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:45.030
<v 0>Steve,</v>

225
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:48.200
do you think there are like some schools and like companies where like they get

226
00:11:48.201 --> 00:11:50.210
bullied if you got like a bad rating?

227
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:52.340
<v 1>I think it's totally,</v>

228
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:57.210
I it's a thing in Asia because I heard because got a Dean is because,

229
00:11:57.211 --> 00:12:00.430
because in, in, in Asia, I don't know if I'm talking out my,

230
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.330
but you see in like anime definitely where you get the test results. Right.

231
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.700
And it's like publicly posted. So you,

232
00:12:06.701 --> 00:12:09.640
you publicly know what your fellow classmates got.

233
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.210
And that to me seems like a lot of pressure.

234
00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:16.000
And I feel like university like entrance exams as well.

235
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:19.330
They like create a huge billboard in front of the school.

236
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.910
And it has like your number on it. And if your number doesn't show up,

237
00:12:21.911 --> 00:12:22.750
you basically failed.

238
00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:27.430
It's like a public execution eventually make a public tournament arc for your

239
00:12:27.431 --> 00:12:31.390
test results. No one know that they put so much value on tests.

240
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:32.800
And I think that can,

241
00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:37.810
I can definitely see that to me from my experience can definitely skew with your

242
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:42.340
mentality when you go out of schooling and you realize that not everything in

243
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:47.050
life is graded and not everything in life has a percentage or a grade.

244
00:12:47.051 --> 00:12:50.590
That's a judges, your results and how well you do. Yeah.

245
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.390
<v 0>Of the given the industry that we've gone into, which is entertainment,</v>

246
00:12:54.391 --> 00:12:57.230
if you will. Uh, but if you called trash tastes entertainment,

247
00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.280
but we're trying our best here. Um,

248
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:04.230
I feel like the skill set is nearly one 80 in compares of what you

249
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.110
learn in school. Right. It's purely based on, like,

250
00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.710
I feel like social skills are 90% of our job. Yeah. Right.

251
00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:14.040
Being able to read a room, being able to like talk, you know? And it, I mean,

252
00:13:14.041 --> 00:13:15.480
obviously there is a lot of technical aspects,

253
00:13:15.481 --> 00:13:17.160
obviously like learning how to set up all this equipment,

254
00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.970
but the majority of it can't be taught in a classroom and it's kind of,

255
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.180
and you can't grade it. How can you grade someone social skills?

256
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.290
And that's when we started doing that.

257
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.273
<v 1>Oh.</v>

258
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:30.810
<v 0>You know, you were an,</v>

259
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.720
but ever since the event happened to you that you've come kind of a bummer.

260
00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.310
You're kind of a D now, you know what I mean?

261
00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.060
<v 1>Yeah. It's like, it's like getting graded for every tweet you make. Right.</v>

262
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:40.493
Honestly.

263
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.340
<v 0>Well, yeah, that's true. He's just going to fight away.</v>
