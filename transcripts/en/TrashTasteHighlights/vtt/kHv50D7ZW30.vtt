1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.960
<v 0>Yes. I think this is a good time to move on to our three by threes.</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.500
Now there's a reason why I have my laptop is because we're going to create a

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.260
three. We're going to share each other's three by three of anime.

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.140
We've explained at the beginning of the way, we're three by three songs,

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.290
but like to expand further on that, I like,

6
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.790
I love seeing people's three by three, right? Cause I,

7
00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:22.620
I feel like a three by three is the closest thing you get to a Rorschach test

8
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.310
for like automate fans. You know what I mean? Cause you, you get,

9
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.820
you got to see cause like, like asking,

10
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.890
asking what someone's favorite anime is, is like a stupid question because like,

11
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:37.590
if you've seen enough changes all the time, it changes all the time.

12
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:42.230
But like we've, we've like, we've like, uh, kind of with nine animated,

13
00:00:42.231 --> 00:00:46.860
choose from that's a good sample size to really get a grasp on what this

14
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:51.000
person's taste is. Like. Not, not, not if all their tastes,

15
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.970
because I dunno how hard a time you guys had choosing nine anime.

16
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.490
<v 1>I was just shoved through to get nine to get that I liked.</v>

17
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.940
<v 0>But I had a pretty difficult time just choosing my anatomy.</v>

18
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.840
<v 1>You probably have like a seizure just thinking like,</v>

19
00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:05.690
what am I going to do for like breakfast? Like, Oh my God, like Jesus Christ.

20
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.110
Like, that's why you like take so long to contemplate decisions.

21
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.621
<v 0>I mean,</v>

22
00:01:09.621 --> 00:01:12.920
I can come up with mine pretty quickly just because like I literally thought of

23
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:14.720
the first night we're going to look at mine first,

24
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.620
but I literally just thought of the first nine that I think is like, yeah,

25
00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:21.710
I love this because I think that's the most important thing is like, I feel,

26
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:26.360
if you think too hard about it, then you're kind of reshaping your tastes.

27
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.220
It's just generally just a bad policy. So I was, I was like, all right,

28
00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:34.880
what are the nice shows that I love? Just a bad post

29
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.040
thinking is overrated. I just go with a gut that an unpopular opinion,

30
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.510
unpopular opinions. Thinking's overrated. All right.

31
00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:47.900
So let's look at mine first. All right. Let's see what you got here, Joe.

32
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.250
[inaudible]

33
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.780
do you want to introduce to the audience who cannot see or don't go to these

34
00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:01.280
shows? What? So from,

35
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.910
so top row from left to right is serial experiments lane clan add fully coli.

36
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.690
Middle row is princess Mononoke. Lucky stop on. Okay.

37
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.130
And then bottom row is [inaudible] one of the tire series. You Hawkshaw.

38
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.430
Why? Lucky star. I I've got her.

39
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.390
[inaudible] I it's quite it's right.

40
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.110
Bang there in the sense of staring at me again,

41
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.970
don't worry about placements too much. Don't worry about placements too much.

42
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.840
This could be an any random order. Yeah. Reason why. Okay.

43
00:02:32.841 --> 00:02:37.780
I completely get why someone would look at me and say for our lucky stars,

44
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.960
not good because truth be told if you watch lucky star today,

45
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.150
it'd probably be. Right?

46
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.640
Lucky star to me is so time sensitive because all of its jokes

47
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.690
are time sensitive.

48
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.610
Like lucky style was one of those shows that made fun of like otaku and

49
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.320
weed culture back in like the mid two thousands. Um,

50
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.110
I'm turning this into a like video. I'll tell you a lucky star.

51
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.480
<v 1>My friend, lucky star is a Reddit humor before.</v>

52
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.700
<v 0>That's it's it's it's like the it's like the late two thousands Reddit here and</v>

53
00:03:11.701 --> 00:03:14.250
the Reddit just didn't exist. So I don't know. I was just like, Oh, lucky size.

54
00:03:14.251 --> 00:03:15.084
Amazing. Huh?

55
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.970
<v 1>I couldn't sit through it. Really? No, I didn't finish it. I.</v>

56
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.100
<v 0>Say like, it's weird because random,</v>

57
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.790
a couple of days ago I was just scrolling through YouTube and on my recommended,

58
00:03:23.791 --> 00:03:26.910
there was just like a lucky star, like funny compilation. And I was just like,

59
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.370
I haven't heard of lucky. It was like six minutes long. I'm like, you know what?

60
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.880
it. I've got time. It sounds like an oxymoron to me. Lucky stuff.

61
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.710
Funny compilation. But I dunno.

62
00:03:40.711 --> 00:03:42.630
I think it's because like, especially around,

63
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.100
around the time when I watch lucky star,

64
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.330
I was like really heavily into obviously of course like anime obviously,

65
00:03:48.331 --> 00:03:51.570
but I was really heavily into like the otaku culture,

66
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.430
especially in Japan and lucky star kind of went over all of that and

67
00:03:56.431 --> 00:03:59.730
put it into perspective of like it's pretty ridiculous.

68
00:03:59.731 --> 00:04:01.290
Looking from an outsider's perspective.

69
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.600
<v 1>Yeah. I just cafes weird, huh?</v>

70
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.230
<v 0>Yeah, no, not even that. It was just like, like the we get seen.</v>

71
00:04:07.231 --> 00:04:10.350
It's still funny to this day just because it's so accurate. I mean, I just,

72
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.780
I look back at lucky star and I never liked it originally,

73
00:04:12.781 --> 00:04:16.320
but I looked back at some of the scenes. I'm just like, yeah, this doesn't age.

74
00:04:16.321 --> 00:04:18.240
Well to me at all. Right, exactly.

75
00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:22.140
And that's why I never recommend lucky star to people today because it has not

76
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.940
aged. Well, the jokes have not age. Well, I have a question.

77
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.310
<v 1>What the is this show in the bottom corner I've seen.</v>

78
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.060
<v 0>The bottom left. What does that show English name of that,</v>

79
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.730
uh, God, I haven't even, I think I've watched that show. It's basically,

80
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.200
it's basically like a comedy show that throws in a lot of itchy jokes and like

81
00:04:40.201 --> 00:04:42.630
sexual jokes. I've watched the show and I don't remember anything.

82
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.080
<v 1>I, a hundred percent I've watched the show. I'm one small,</v>

83
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.680
small girls angry that she doesn't have big. Right, right.

84
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:50.790
That's one of the jokes. Yeah.

85
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.710
<v 0>You funny? Yeah. Okay. Why, why is this in your three buckets?</v>

86
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.500
This is in my three by three because a, well, first of all,

87
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.180
I think it's hilarious.

88
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.920
It kind of my love for comedy and my love for ECI.

89
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.970
<v 1>Broad term of what comedy is. Um, lucky star.</v>

90
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.460
<v 0>Your love for comedy art. What about the show that comes to this?</v>

91
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.360
Your love for comedy? I think it's fun. I mean, I don't know what else,

92
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.613
what the,

93
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.740
because it's very intricate in the jokes that constructed a very, this,

94
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:26.700
this, okay.

95
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.180
The reason why I put this and it's because it encompasses my love for trashy

96
00:05:30.181 --> 00:05:33.510
shows. Oh, this show is not good. In any perspective.

97
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.870
I'm just saying it right now. All right. Here's how you know that my, you know,

98
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.430
my three by three is legit. Right? Give me some of the

99
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.680
[inaudible] is not a good show. It is trashy comedy. Okay. With ECI jokes,

100
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.530
they're actually bugging me. All right. Okay.

101
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.770
Here's the reason why I put it in important question then every show here. Yeah.

102
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.850
Would you rewatch it today? Yeah, you would. I would.

103
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.720
You've rewatched lucky stone. I've did I not to say that?

104
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.190
I was literally watching.

105
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.390
<v 1>Two days ago. I just thought it was a lie. Honestly. I just didn't believe it.</v>

106
00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.450
<v 0>Well, I would a hundred percent rewatch all these shows today. I got to say,</v>

107
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.830
I was like, I didn't put it on, but I was this close to putting you on the show.

108
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.880
I am glad that you put it in because it represents my love for sure.

109
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.440
<v 1>I gotta be honest. Right, boys.</v>

110
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.490
I legitimately try to watch you hack shirt no less than a week ago. Right?

111
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.780
I put it on first episode and I was like, I can't watch this.

112
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.960
Like I thought it was the DOB and I was like the dubs too awful.

113
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.890
I switched the Japanese. I'm like. It's woeful as well. I can't stand.

114
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:42.910
<v 0>What are you talking about?</v>

115
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.270
<v 1>The audio was driving me insane. Like I actually couldn't watch it.</v>

116
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.700
It was such bad quality. I know that it's old, but like,

117
00:06:48.701 --> 00:06:49.600
I actually couldn't sit there.

118
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.710
<v 0>So basically your review of you Huck show is where it's old there. Honestly.</v>

119
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.630
<v 1>That I'm like that. But like I was like, I actually, Oh my God.</v>

120
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:00.850
Really going to hit me with that.

121
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.150
<v 0>What was your, what was your problem with the audience?</v>

122
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.690
Cause like you Huck show from what I remember was like one of my favorite dubs,

123
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:09.520
I never watched it.

124
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.840
<v 1>I swear 10 seconds into the DOB light fire. Listen to the Japanese. I gotta,</v>

125
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.490
I gotta, I gotta turn this off.

126
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.060
<v 0>It's pretty bad. The paid use gay. Cause you scare, you like killed it.</v>

127
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.940
<v 1>This is probably just a case of, you know, uh, you know,</v>

128
00:07:24.941 --> 00:07:28.300
watching it years later and being spoiled for choice, et cetera, et cetera.

129
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.190
<v 0>Okay. Like I put you Hutcher there because obviously I love my shining,</v>

130
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.900
but I feel like, I don't know.

131
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:40.120
I've never felt the same level of excitement that I felt watching and Hawkshaw

132
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.040
that I have from any I'm envious. I want that you,

133
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.350
hockey show has some of my favorite arcs in all have shown in the dark

134
00:07:47.351 --> 00:07:51.070
tournament, Ark Tuesday, one of the best arcs in showing Shona,

135
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.050
the dark tournament arc is the best tournament arc hands-down of all time.

136
00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:01.300
And this is, this is a tournament arc that came out 20 years ago. Now. Like it,

137
00:08:01.301 --> 00:08:04.950
it, it birth the tournament Alejandra. The reason why,

138
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:09.220
the reason why tournament arcs have become a meme and are so hyped is because of

139
00:08:09.221 --> 00:08:13.390
you because of you, you like Dragonball. Might've like popularized it.

140
00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.770
Perfect. It hasn't been perfected since then.

141
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.830
But like also like we is one of the best villains in all

142
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:27.760
shown in as well. [inaudible] Oh my God. Such a good character.

143
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:32.140
Not going to lie growing up. I want it to be here so bad. I was like,

144
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.810
I looked at here and I'm just like everything about this guy

145
00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:42.460
[inaudible] is so cool.

146
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:44.470
<v 1>Experiments laying at.</v>

147
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:49.120
<v 0>The tall. Yeah. That's top left. Why? I think because like, well again,</v>

148
00:08:49.121 --> 00:08:52.600
I still think it's insanely ahead of its time.

149
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:57.570
Like this was made back in like the late and it talks about societal issues

150
00:08:57.571 --> 00:09:00.420
that are relevant today. Right. And that's, I don't know.

151
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:01.890
I think that's like a huge artist.

152
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.210
Like what type of stuff that they talk about in the show,

153
00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:09.860
what kind of societal basically grossly over-simplify Cyril experiments lane is

154
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:14.660
essentially this idea that your digital identity and your real life identity

155
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.830
sees no barrier.

156
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:20.840
And so basically it follows obviously lane who kind of goes through this like

157
00:09:20.841 --> 00:09:23.720
discovery of herself and the world in being like,

158
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:28.820
wait so we can create digital identities of ourselves on the quote unquote

159
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.820
internet. I mean, obviously back then it was very primal. Right.

160
00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.990
But came out in 1990, 98, eight. Yeah. And just,

161
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.560
just to give it didn't even have balloons tout offense for flash play,

162
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.100
but basically it's, it's this idea that like, wait,

163
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:47.690
so if things happen in the digital world then is there really no

164
00:09:47.691 --> 00:09:49.880
consequences of that in the real world environment?

165
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:54.830
And they did that in 12 episodes and it's it's, uh, I,

166
00:09:54.831 --> 00:09:57.370
I will test that, see what we're experiencing.

167
00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:01.640
It's amazing because I remember I watched it for the first time last year.

168
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.630
So I watched it pretty well cause he was on my to watch this forever.

169
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.870
And then I was just like, you know, I'm finally in the mood to watch this.

170
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.870
I'll give it a watch. And I remember thinking, man, this,

171
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.820
normally when you see a piece of media that focuses around technology and like

172
00:10:16.821 --> 00:10:20.360
stories around technology, it ages horribly.

173
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:24.650
I remember watching Sarah expense land. I'm thinking, how is this?

174
00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:29.840
How does this seem like it's more relevant now than it is when it first

175
00:10:29.841 --> 00:10:34.610
came out? Let show 20 years. Sure. Low key foretold.

176
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:38.010
The future of social media. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think,

177
00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.090
I think I gotta understand that if you are really in touch with the internet

178
00:10:41.091 --> 00:10:44.180
back then you could probably see where it was going. I think. And I think,

179
00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.640
and obviously I picked serial experiments like that, obviously,

180
00:10:46.641 --> 00:10:51.440
because I love it. But also I love, I mean the shows that make you think,

181
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:55.340
quote, unquote, that to dive more into that kind of stuff, like, you know,

182
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.820
make you thunk, right? Like vulgar proxy is in the same field as that.

183
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.930
I love that show and uh, you know, Raza, Fon as well was in there as well.

184
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:08.890
Climate. I mean, I just think it's good. Hey, made me cry.

185
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.080
Made me cry. My love for my to journey.

186
00:11:12.081 --> 00:11:14.480
Both my love for no fair enough

187
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:19.880
really is just a master seven episodes.

188
00:11:19.881 --> 00:11:24.770
And it feels like a five-hour long movie. It's it's a very dense show.

189
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:29.000
Very. I would say he does not. Why does dance always just sound like an insult?

190
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:35.030
It's a fiction. What'd you want to say? No, no. It's it's a, it's a compact

191
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.420
compact SUV. So did salt.

192
00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:42.290
The dense dense sounds like it's like sh like brick house, like

193
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.890
garbage. It's a compact show.

194
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:50.750
Cause there is like Callie has 24.

195
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.430
I would dare say 24 episodes worth of material packed into seven episodes.

196
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.990
I would agree with that. Yeah. And it's got the soundtrack.

197
00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:00.640
One of the best soundtracks of all time track is amazing. amazing.

198
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.370
I've no more questions. You're free to go. Yeah. Okay. Wait a minute. No, no,

199
00:12:04.371 --> 00:12:06.930
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

200
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:12.150
You had a choice of any anime movies and you pick a Ghibli movie. I mean,

201
00:12:12.151 --> 00:12:14.940
look man, you gave this a 10 out of 10 wasn't on your list

202
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.860
and you also didn't change that school. So it's a good movie.

203
00:12:19.861 --> 00:12:24.000
Would I put it as like any movie is the best anime movie going?

204
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.170
He's going to say your name. You're you're you're you're you're gonna find out.
