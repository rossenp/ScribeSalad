1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.610
<v 0>I there's been way too many cases. Obviously our people are going,</v>

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.110
we're going broke spending.

3
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.790
<v 1>How many cases do you know, how many do you know here at all time, from who,</v>

4
00:00:07.791 --> 00:00:08.624
from who.

5
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.600
<v 0>You asked, how many people had like spent a significant amount of their savings,</v>

6
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.370
or like, I spent too much money. Oops, sorry.

7
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.520
Spent an amount of money that ended up like they regretted.

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.740
I bet there would be like 50% minimum.

9
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.350
<v 1>No, we can do it right now. We can do it. I'm fine.</v>

10
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.480
I don't Twitter. Have you ever spent in a month.

11
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.080
<v 0>Amount of money on a Gacha game or video game that you ended up severely</v>

12
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.380
regressing, be honest, be honest, be totally honest with a proper scientist.

13
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.650
<v 1>The conduct we're doing right now. We actually want to know no me.</v>

14
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.450
I'm actually genuinely curious. I love gaming. So I am a gamer gamers,

15
00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:44.060
rise up, rise and grind.

16
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.100
<v 2>Hi, I am a casual gamer. I just like enjoying my time playing a video game.</v>

17
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.990
And if I, you know, if,

18
00:00:50.991 --> 00:00:55.580
if I wanted to enjoy my time pulling for some wild foods, then that I know,

19
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.060
I know that that's on me because I know that that's what I'm paying for.

20
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.193
You know what I mean?

21
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.710
<v 0>I also mean as well. I understand that I've self, I don't need to do that.</v>

22
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.660
<v 2>Grids. Any money that I've ever put into Gacha no, from, from the beginning you,</v>

23
00:01:08.661 --> 00:01:09.460
would you ever say.

24
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.070
<v 0>That you've fallen for something that is perhaps like, you know, maybe a little,</v>

25
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.830
not predatory, but close to it, right? Maybe like, uh,

26
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.380
they keep offering you stuff, you know, there's deals constantly.

27
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.850
<v 2>Look, I'm not going to lie and say that Gacha, isn't just gambling with WiFi's.</v>

28
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.230
Cause it is okay. It's but like I've never seen, I've never,

29
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.600
I've never seen the appeal of casinos for, because,

30
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.890
because of the reason that I said where, you know, to me, casinos are scary.

31
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.540
Cause you, you pay for the chance to win more money. And that's, that's like,

32
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.020
that's, that's like that's to me, that's like a risk right there.

33
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.280
Cause that's literally just gambling.

34
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.440
But to me like Gacha is I'm paying for an experience I'm paying because

35
00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:51.730
I actually want this thing that I'm putting money into. No one, I,

36
00:01:51.731 --> 00:01:53.860
I actually want it. And it's,

37
00:01:53.861 --> 00:01:56.840
it's different where people are going to meme this and say, Oh God,

38
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.870
God doesn't care about getting money. And that's not what I'm saying. Right.

39
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.940
I'm saying if I'm, if I'm going to get money,

40
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.600
there are plenty of other ways that I would want to get money. I,

41
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.400
as the last things,

42
00:02:07.401 --> 00:02:11.360
the last gambling's the last way I would use to actually get money, I would.

43
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.760
<v 1>Wanna work for that. But there's only one way to get wifi. I rarely give a.</v>

44
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.780
<v 0>About what meme do. Right. I'm not like that. But I guess, because we're,</v>

45
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.460
we're in the position where we all have our own job, we were all old,

46
00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:24.730
old people compared to the zoomers out there.

47
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.440
<v 1>Okay. And probably you're the youngest one, but you're the</v>

48
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.030
[inaudible] on Twitter sometimes. Right.

49
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.460
<v 0>Hella normalized, right. Spending, you know, a hundred bucks on a few pools.</v>

50
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.790
Right. Me and the boys going to pull a few WiFi's right, right.

51
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.790
<v 1>And then the w w we're joking about it on Twitter, you know,</v>

52
00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.790
we we're going to be stream it, but it's not like, you know, someone goes.

53
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.540
<v 0>A casino and his eye, or do a cheeky, like 10 pole on rubella hat. Right.</v>

54
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.430
And then like, you know, everyone's beaming it.

55
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.520
<v 1>The classic bet on red, meaning the ship, right.</v>

56
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.010
To like 15 year olds who are.

57
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.800
<v 0>Then wanting to do it. Right. I mean, like we have like a, like, I dunno,</v>

58
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:03.634
it feels weird. Okay.

59
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.850
<v 2>Well, what I would say is, okay,</v>

60
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.490
like part of the reason why I've been spending more on like, gotcha.

61
00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.160
Now is because 2020 has been boring as or 2020 was boring as. And I,

62
00:03:13.161 --> 00:03:15.330
and I think to myself, what are, what would I be at?

63
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.720
What would I have spent that money on anyway, probably going out and getting.

64
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.600
Like how much do you spend on a, not on a night out? Like.

65
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.850
<v 1>Yeah. It depends where [inaudible].</v>

66
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.870
<v 2>Let's say, let's say a standard sesh in London with the boys, right.</v>

67
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.040
You can spend upwards of like hundred, 200 pounds on drinks.

68
00:03:35.041 --> 00:03:36.700
What are you getting up to in London? Just pop a.

69
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.850
<v 1>Champagne drink when a.</v>

70
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.900
<v 2>When one single cocktail in London is like a tenor. Like you,</v>

71
00:03:42.901 --> 00:03:45.600
you start off that, you start off like a Weatherspoon or something, you know,

72
00:03:45.601 --> 00:03:46.620
that's, that's the cheap drinks,

73
00:03:46.621 --> 00:03:49.110
but like get further or further along in the night,

74
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.100
people easily spend a hundred to 200 pounds on one night.

75
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.881
<v 0>It's more out of that.</v>

76
00:03:53.881 --> 00:03:56.520
10 minutes of pulling that catcher then a whole night with your boys.

77
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.350
<v 2>I mean, I would say that.</v>

78
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.160
<v 1>No, no, no, no, no. You're a politician right now. God, what is this? Come on.</v>

79
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.320
I'm just, I'm just.

80
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.850
<v 2>Saying like, like you, you, you are like, yo, I'm being attacked.</v>

81
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.200
<v 1>I need, I need her. I need to defend myself. I need to,</v>

82
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.710
[inaudible].

83
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.610
<v 2>You say, you say we've normalized the staff, but like, you are fine.</v>

84
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.510
For example,

85
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.600
we're spending that much on a night out because that's what you choose.

86
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.330
You know, that's what you choose as the experience.

87
00:04:27.331 --> 00:04:30.390
And that's what you choose is okay for the price. You know what I mean?

88
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.710
<v 0>What you're saying is a night out with the boys is the equivalent to getting</v>

89
00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:37.530
your favorite life is there's tangible stuff. You're buying,

90
00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:40.650
you're buying drinks there. That is stuff that has to be made that you're going,

91
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.580
you're transporting. This is all stuff that, you know, has a cost for a reason.

92
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.120
We can't show it's conflated because they know they can get away with it. Right.

93
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.100
They know they can charge this much for a pole. I mean,

94
00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:54.570
it's the equivalent of like going out to a bar and buying a Tana drink and going

95
00:04:54.571 --> 00:04:57.750
home and pouring yourself that same drink. Right? No, it's different.

96
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.230
<v 2>Because like getting, uh, getting, uh, getting your favorite wine.</v>

97
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.610
<v 0>On a 40 Paul is, is the, is the pouring your drink at home? No, it's not.</v>

98
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.880
What's the going out then? What's that the temple you pay for?

99
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.510
<v 1>That's exactly what it is.</v>

100
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.920
<v 0>Oh my God. This is, this is so such low brain IQ. No dude. Okay. When you go to,</v>

101
00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.950
uh, uh, like let's say you go to a bar in London, right? You pay, I don't know,

102
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.970
nine pounds for a cocktail, you know, paying for the ingredients. Right.

103
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.710
You're paying for someone born to make it, you pay,

104
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.110
you're paying for the experience you're paying for the experience you're paying

105
00:05:28.111 --> 00:05:31.380
for like, you know, the, the glass, the expertly prepared. Right.

106
00:05:31.381 --> 00:05:35.700
You're paying for that. Yeah. Do you have nice cocktail glasses at home?

107
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.250
Oh no. I ain't going to buy them. They're like 30 Quip.

108
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.520
They have really nice ones. Right? Everything you get is tailored experience.

109
00:05:41.521 --> 00:05:44.370
That's why the price goes. Is it a bit of a rip off? Yeah. Of,

110
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.520
but it's not like to the point where I feel like I'm being taken advantage of

111
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.470
Gacha games. I kind of do.

112
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.240
<v 1>But that's just on, you.</v>

113
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.180
<v 0>Know, I feel like they, I,</v>

114
00:05:53.181 --> 00:05:57.950
I genuinely believe that like Gacha games to some extent are like, just take it,

115
00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:00.110
getting away with as much as they can and take advantage of it.

116
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.050
<v 2>Of course, they're getting close to this. I mean,</v>

117
00:06:02.051 --> 00:06:04.750
I'm not going to say that they're not getting away with it as much as I can.

118
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.290
I totally believe that there should be regulations around this stuff.

119
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.860
That's not the argument here. That's not the argument.

120
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.310
<v 0>The fact that it took like multiple governments to get involved,</v>

121
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.850
just to make them to show you the odds is like ridiculous.

122
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.550
Like how long were people getting over? Because they didn't know.

123
00:06:21.551 --> 00:06:23.230
The percentage was 0.001.

124
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.320
<v 2>Oh a long time. A long time.</v>

125
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.160
<v 0>I also didn't care. Yeah. But how is it ever acceptable? Like that,</v>

126
00:06:30.161 --> 00:06:31.560
that was okay. Like casino.

127
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.360
<v 2>Right? Right. Like even just seeing them.</v>

128
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.480
<v 0>That's scummy. They'll let you know, like, I like this,</v>

129
00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:40.210
this just blows my mind and how people constantly defend them.

130
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.760
And they're like is I would re I would be more okay with,

131
00:06:42.761 --> 00:06:44.920
if everyone just admitted, she's one big scam.

132
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.180
And we're all just in for it because.

133
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.410
<v 2>It's not a scam though. It's not a scam. It's like one step away from a scam.</v>

134
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.580
What's that one? What is a scam for you then? What is this genuinely?

135
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.070
Because to me a scam is like,

136
00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.570
it means that you are getting what's, what's the word I'm looking for?

137
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.710
Like the users in the dark. We know exactly what we're getting ourselves into.

138
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.100
And that's why, to me, it is not a scam. It's like saying like, Oh,

139
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.000
on this banner, the 10 is a guaranteed six staff. When it's not a guarantee.

140
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.630
<v 0>That's coming to stop any more like government regulation. Right.</v>

141
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:17.770
Because if they were trying to get away with that.

142
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:22.450
<v 2>That is a scam. If they're asleep, lying to the user base, then that's,</v>

143
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.890
to me is a scam, which.

144
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.690
<v 0>Sure many of them were at some point. Right. We didn't know. I mean,</v>

145
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.553
come on.

146
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.400
<v 2>And I think it's our Gacha games a little bit perjury. Yeah. They are.</v>

147
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:38.170
And I feel like the best, the best weapon against that is just education. Right?

148
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.940
It's it's like, no, no, don't do drugs.

149
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.590
Have a wrinkly brain. That's all it is like, I mean, I'm even the up,

150
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.710
but if you want to, if you want me to talk about the, like the realities of it,

151
00:07:50.711 --> 00:07:54.130
I will talk about the realities of it. And, and that's because I don't want,

152
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.310
I know exactly what I'm getting into with Gacha games.

153
00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.600
And I know what my limits are.

154
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.420
<v 0>I do think it's, it's gotten much better since they've won.</v>

155
00:08:01.421 --> 00:08:03.580
You get a guaranteed and you know, you get,

156
00:08:03.581 --> 00:08:06.730
you get to see the rates that's much better. Yeah. That's increased it a lot.

157
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.270
<v 2>Like I, I mean, I mean,</v>

158
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:13.210
I mean the up that I'm like spending money on like literally a North

159
00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:17.830
0.6%, but that's on me to make that decision.

160
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:22.930
But even, even if I wasn't, you know what I mean? I, I know it's on the person.

161
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.080
<v 0>Not always. I think,</v>

162
00:08:25.081 --> 00:08:28.180
I think sometimes depending on how we were going in circles, kind of like,

163
00:08:28.181 --> 00:08:30.130
depending on how the game is presented and made,

164
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.520
I think sometimes it can be on the game. Right.

165
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.850
And I hate how you can't even have this discussion of it being like, Oh,

166
00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:38.950
you're just whining, bro. It's free to play any way. And it's like,

167
00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:42.160
it's not that simple. I think it's never that simple. I mean, I,

168
00:08:42.161 --> 00:08:46.060
I feel like if not opening the door to that conversation is irresponsible.

169
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:46.810
I mean.

170
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.890
<v 2>For me, I feel like the conversation to me, it always ends up. If, if it,</v>

171
00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.920
if it doesn't feel like, you know, your type of game, like,

172
00:08:53.921 --> 00:08:57.910
I don't feel like you were for Gacha games. And I, I genuinely believe that.

173
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:02.070
Cause I feel like someone with your personality, like a true gamer.

174
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.080
<v 1>Just would never enjoy gotcha. Game.</v>

175
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.970
<v 0>No, I just, I hate that. I paying for part of a game. Yeah. I hate that.</v>

176
00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:08.780
And I'm.

177
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.610
<v 2>Completely fine without gotcha. Games.</v>

178
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.050
The reason I love Gacha games is because it suits my lifestyle perfectly.

179
00:09:15.051 --> 00:09:19.700
It suits my mentality when it comes to playing games perfectly gotcha. Game.

180
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.600
<v 0>I don't like, I'm not saying that Gacha shouldn't exist or anything like that.</v>

181
00:09:23.601 --> 00:09:26.180
I totally recognize that it has its place and it's got its value.

182
00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:30.590
I just want like everything to be more transparent and there'll be the systems

183
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.530
in place to stop people going broke from them.

184
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.980
I don't think anyone should go broke from, like, I don't know, off nights.

185
00:09:36.981 --> 00:09:40.910
So you kidding me? Like no, no one should be going broke from video games. Why,

186
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.710
why was that even an option?

187
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.100
<v 2>I mean, it's, it shouldn't be an option and that's, that's what we agree.</v>

188
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.920
<v 0>Right, right. Yeah. And like, I just it's like,</v>

189
00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:52.100
we've totally like been made it totally memorable and okay. To be like, ah,

190
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.420
he's gone broke what an.

191
00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.130
<v 1>We haven't MeMed up people going, bro. Let's do man.</v>

192
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.100
Who's meaning, don't go to the, I bet the sub bro,

193
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.070
every summer, if someone.

194
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:08.360
<v 2>It's like, if someone's like, Oh,</v>

195
00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.810
I just spent hundred hundred dollars on a Gacha and I put with nothing.

196
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.590
That's that's, that's.

197
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.450
<v 1>Basically like the same as what you did to.</v>

198
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.180
<v 2>Eugene being like you, you just spent,</v>

199
00:10:17.181 --> 00:10:19.850
you just spent a hundred pounds on a casino and you didn't.

200
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:21.860
<v 1>And also there's nothing. There's nothing on Twitter.</v>

201
00:10:21.861 --> 00:10:24.810
That's not getting mean dog. Like you'll you can scroll on Twitter,

202
00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:25.813
be like LOL his dad.

203
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.480
<v 2>If someone has a legitimate problem. And someone's like, dude,</v>

204
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:33.620
I've I've fully regrets, you know, spending this much on. Gotcha.

205
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:38.510
Then I'll be like, bro, I'm sorry. Just got to quit. You know what I mean?

206
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.880
That's this is, this is bad. This is bad. You shouldn't.

207
00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.103
<v 1>There's nothing.</v>

208
00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:46.820
[inaudible] there's nothing else we can say that we now position.

209
00:10:46.821 --> 00:10:47.654
There's nothing else you can say.

210
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:52.160
<v 0>Stop doing drugs, bro. Just stop. Why doing drugs, man? Like it's not that easy.</v>

211
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.170
That's again. And the point that's no more, no more.

212
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.090
There should be regulations.

213
00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.040
<v 1>Bottom line should be Holman. Needs to make the gotcha.</v>

214
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:59.720
<v 2>A reality. One of the line,</v>

215
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.860
there should be regulations with on how strictly are that's up for debate

216
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.350
between catch a players and a game.

217
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:11.030
<v 1>Apparently per game of goals and gotcha. Game and goals.</v>

218
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:12.830
Never-ending war.

219
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.680
<v 0>I think there should be like a cool-down period. A hundred percent.</v>

220
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.090
That's my that's my closing statements.
