00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.070
<v 0>Time. The camera shuts off.</v>

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.370
You just say this offhand comment and we're just like, Whoa, shut them out.

3
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:08.360
They like, can you like explain it next, next episode on trust,

4
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.060
trace Christian to be like this one time I accidentally stole the declaration of

5
00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:15.320
independence. Totally funny story. Can't talk about it then. We'll come on,

6
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.650
come on. Set the scene early, hijack the boat. Wow.

7
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.600
How do you nearly millionaire guy in the river? Thames had like a yacht.

8
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.510
Uh, they had a party on a, me and my Stony and Fred crashed it.

9
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.680
John could Ellie like cast off, nearly cast off.

10
00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:32.820
I was really drunk and I found my way into the engine room with this.

11
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.110
You don't just find your way into the engine room activity. It's just some 24.

12
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.090
He's on the Eastern espionage mission.

13
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.190
I'm in a steam GG where I cannot talk about I'm a nice person.

14
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.300
You had a shot of whiskey and found myself in a mic. That's kind of, what is,

15
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.120
it was one kilometer from Emily six on the river.

16
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.740
I could see my six from the boat. I love,

17
00:00:57.741 --> 00:00:59.870
how am I six? You know, this very secretive thing. It's like,

18
00:00:59.871 --> 00:01:03.530
that's the building [inaudible] building. It's like, Oh, there it is.

19
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.870
God. I feel,

20
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.440
I love how you made the most interesting story into the most throwaway tip

21
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.390
along the times where I used to rule Kazak Stan as well.

22
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.850
Classic stories for me, Chris,

23
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.550
I accidentally became the King of Catholics. There'll be a bit, one day.

24
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.290
They're very good perk to promote him. Chris, Chris King of Kansas,

25
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.690
Chris Paul, Chris King of Casper, because he's done too much.

26
00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:35.840
And now he's bought in. It's been scamming people under my name.

27
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.840
[inaudible] I'm a Brown in Japan.

28
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.633
You're kidding me.

29
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.220
It was a Facebook page of a screenshot and it had Chris's face on it with the

30
00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:57.830
logo as like the banner from the fall.

31
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.600
And it was like this one look, you were like, Oh, that's Chris's Facebook page.

32
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.130
But then when you look closely,

33
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.390
Chris Christopher bull rat of a bra,

34
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.470
a Brown in Japan.

35
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.090
And apparently if you get this message, one $5,000, $5,000,

36
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.013
you've just been scared,

37
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.383
Catholics done.

38
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.980
I wish I wish my view is for that creative to come up with with those kinds of

39
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:32.000
things. I had a Brown in Japan.

40
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.020
Do you know what the worst,

41
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.110
the most awkward thing I've ever had was in that kind of sense?

42
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.270
Is that a one time basis? Really?

43
00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:41.090
Back when I started it must have like maybe like 80 K sub. So, you know,

44
00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:44.990
still quite small. And uh, one time I got a Skype friend,

45
00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:48.710
dad from somewhat backwards, Skype was like, not a boomer. I know. It's like,

46
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.950
Oh gee, now I had it. And I was like, okay, sure.

47
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:53.540
What's this is it back when you would just be like, it. Yeah.

48
00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:55.520
I'll just add anyone. Yeah. And they were like,

49
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.030
why aren't you replying to my messages when I added them? And I'm like,

50
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.180
who are you? What are you, why did you I'm like, why did you,

51
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.730
and then you're like, why did you block me in your other account? I'm like,

52
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.630
well, what, w w what other accounts? So what happened was turns out, right?

53
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.320
There's someone had been pretending to be me on a YouTube channel. Right. Right.

54
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.610
And they have, and so I got on call with them because I was like, it. Why not?

55
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.440
Let's go. Let's just see what's going on. So I called them up and they're like,

56
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.590
they were like, absolutely panicking. So I'm like, all right, hold on.

57
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.260
What's going on? Tell him, tell him what's going on here. Like, um,

58
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.790
I was dating you and then we, you stopped messaging me.

59
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.830
And I'm like, you were dating me. And I'm like, this is, this is news to me. Uh,

60
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.810
and they were like, yeah, I met you through your YouTube channel.

61
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.540
And then they linked me my YouTube channel. Right.

62
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.780
And it was someone who had like, Pokemon, like Ruby plastered,

63
00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:51.040
all over their thing called like Seadog VA. Right. And they, they,

64
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.360
they were American doing a terrible British accent pretending to be me.

65
00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.700
So I was like, huh. So you think this is me? And they were like, yeah.

66
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.090
They said that this was your second channel. I'm like,

67
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.040
you have to be kidding. They thought they were dating because this guy,

68
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.180
because this guy apparently was talking to her often and I'm like, do,

69
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.090
did he sound like me? And she's like, yeah. Yeah, he did.

70
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.780
So I looked on the YouTube videos. He sounded American as. How did he sound?

71
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.370
Like, Hey, what's up guys? It's Seadog VA here,

72
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.560
back with another Pokemon. Ruby let's play. And it was like, totally.

73
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.780
I was like, I was dumbfounded at how,

74
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.140
because at one part I felt sorry for this woman, because she was hysterical.

75
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.180
But on the other I'm like, how do you fall?

76
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.510
I feel like you're going to lose your credit card at some point to some, like,

77
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.410
you know, I was like dumbfounded. I'm like, all right. I calmed her down.

78
00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:52.150
I was like, listen. Right. I did not.

79
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.320
That could have been the saga reach out to me

80
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.590
because they were clearly like, you know, dumb,

81
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.410
you know, I don't like to call my, my view is done, but, but I'll say,

82
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.680
but listen, Chris, if you fall for that, you're dumb this. Yeah.

83
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.560
If a guy has a ground on us, their profile picture,

84
00:05:13.561 --> 00:05:16.620
they should be bells in your head as to it not being me. Well,

85
00:05:16.621 --> 00:05:21.210
maybe you call it like the shoulders. You have to feel. Okay.

86
00:05:21.211 --> 00:05:23.400
I feel sorry for someone who would, if they fell for something,

87
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.540
if they were pretend to be me,

88
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.970
but there are certain levels of disbelief where I'm like,

89
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.480
this has gotta be on you. This, this is, you know,

90
00:05:30.481 --> 00:05:32.830
it wasn't even a British accent. That's where I draw the line.

91
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.850
Wasn't even British to even watch my car,

92
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.140
the amount of videos there are people like impersonating me for like funny

93
00:05:40.141 --> 00:05:42.840
videos. Some of them are quite good, but there's so many where it,

94
00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:46.470
doesn't not even remotely sound like me and people are falling. Yeah.

95
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.220
For videos. How so they'll go on discord servers with the name Seadog VA.

96
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.790
And they'll go in and they'll start talking and like a fake discord.

97
00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:56.370
And then sometimes my discord, other discourses too late,

98
00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.470
they go into voice and stuff. Right. And a random service,

99
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.400
random service is for like funny videos. Some are quite funny actually. Yeah.

100
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.660
And they'll, they'll just do a really bad British accent. And everyone be like,

101
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.340
Oh my God, it's sea dog VA. Oh my God. It's him. And I'm sitting here at home.

102
00:06:13.341 --> 00:06:14.174
Like.

103
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.480
<v 1>Seriously, that's all it takes. Oh,</v>

104
00:06:16.481 --> 00:06:19.600
apparently there's like a demographic of your fans who watch your videos have

105
00:06:19.601 --> 00:06:22.630
muted. Everyone. Everyone who is British sounds like condom.
