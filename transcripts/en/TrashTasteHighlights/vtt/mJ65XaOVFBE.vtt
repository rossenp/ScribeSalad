00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.840
<v 0>I dunno, like for me, I love the feeling, especially in summer when it's hot,</v>

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.380
just taking like a nice, a nice cold shower. It's a little different though.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.930
That's a, that's a bit different, but like eat, like even now,

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.260
now in the winter I take like three showers. Like I get a bit cold showers,

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.930
three showers sometimes. Why not? Not,

6
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.160
not like the one you don't upload videos in the shower. Not, not, not like,

7
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:24.300
not like properly long showers. Just like sometimes I get a bit cold. Like,

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.900
yeah. Like, like I said, my mind, like either I'm too stuffy or I'm too cold.

9
00:00:27.901 --> 00:00:31.920
So sometimes I can't be bothered to wait for the heater to go on just popping

10
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.620
the shower, like get a bit of warm water on me. All right.

11
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.960
I'm back up to walk. This man spends more time in the shower, thinking of ideas.

12
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:40.794
The next one could be this.

13
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.290
<v 1>It's not the clown. Here's the whole circus. You know, it's also up as well.</v>

14
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.260
About you gone hate to bully you this episode,

15
00:00:48.261 --> 00:00:51.290
but you don't use your bath at all. Do you took that?

16
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.160
<v 0>I sit down. I look nice. I mean, okay.</v>

17
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.410
I don't like taking a bath in, like,

18
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.140
it feels like I'm in like a prison cell bath. You know what I mean?

19
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:04.370
I feel like I'm taking like, okay, so Japanese boss are tiny.

20
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.490
They're not bad yours. Isn't that bad. You can, you can see. Okay.

21
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.090
If I can't stretch my legs out in the bath, then it's not even a bath to me.

22
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.960
It's a glorified sink in that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

23
00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:21.050
The point is you have to take a bath, like, like this, you do the

24
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.880
[inaudible] position. Like, okay.

25
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.370
<v 1>I take, like, I would say 90% baths, 10% showers,</v>

26
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.730
honestly, honestly, because in Japan, right?

27
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.740
The best thing is is that you can like reserve your bath. Yeah. Yeah.

28
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.550
As it says, which is like, if you know what time you're waking up,

29
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.820
you can set the bath to be full and hot by that time.

30
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.090
Which why the do we not have this biggest brain?

31
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.750
Like w they have like NASA in the U S but they haven't figured out how to

32
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.660
schedule a bath. Like, I know what time I'm going to wake up.

33
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.820
I know what someone needs to be in that bathtub.

34
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.850
Why can I not do this basic function? Right.

35
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.150
And then also you have one button you don't like, because in the UK, right.

36
00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:07.640
What you have to do is just turn the tap on and keep checking on it.

37
00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:09.740
Every five minutes, pain, the in Japan,

38
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.530
there's one button that fills it up to the perfect amount of the amount that you

39
00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:17.150
set at the exact temperature that you set. How is this is the future, man.

40
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.030
Like, why wouldn't I take a bath?

41
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.680
<v 0>I just feel like for me, baths are just not,</v>

42
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.650
I'm not ergo ergonomically designed for me. Cause like,

43
00:02:24.651 --> 00:02:27.410
I feel like I'm too tall to properly appreciate a good bath.

44
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.350
That much taller than call it that much taller than me.

45
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.270
Because like I love on sense. Right?

46
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.960
The reasons I love on-center is I'm submerged in water and I'm in a comfortable

47
00:02:35.961 --> 00:02:36.590
position.

48
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.850
I can never get in a comfortable position in any of any of the baths I've ever

49
00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:43.040
owned in my life because here's, here's the issue, right?

50
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.430
So I want to stress my legs out, but then my body is above the water.

51
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.930
So you go submerge yourself and then you submerge and then your body just gets

52
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.530
caught, right?

53
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.320
<v 1>Peak, peak bath position. Right? It's like the water's up to like,</v>

54
00:02:54.321 --> 00:02:58.460
here are your arms out of the tub. You'll be watching something there,

55
00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.653
but that's the best.

56
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.670
<v 0>As well. Cause then your upper body is like cold. I like.</v>

57
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.980
<v 1>Perfect temperature control because your head is, is like free.</v>

58
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.280
You've got this bit getting cold. And then you got the restaurant.

59
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.100
<v 0>Also because the bath water is so hot. It, the,</v>

60
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.610
the hop like the steam from the hot water makes the room warm as well.

61
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:18.091
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

62
00:03:18.091 --> 00:03:22.230
It's I feel like you just haven't given baths the true shot they deserve gone.

63
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.400
I pan again, you're wasting another potential of Japan,

64
00:03:26.401 --> 00:03:27.870
which is how good the bath saw.

65
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.270
<v 0>Way too small. I don't want to be city. If my, if my legs are cold,</v>

66
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.380
then that's not a bath to me. I w what we're doing, you're not daddy,

67
00:03:37.381 --> 00:03:41.100
long legs in this. Like, I'm going to your house.

68
00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.430
Bots are meant to be relaxing. And I need,

69
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.920
I need to be in a comfortable position to be in a relaxed.

70
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.200
That's why I love onsens and I just don't take boss showers, showers to me.

71
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.213
I just more or less.

72
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:54.810
<v 1>I don't believe next time I'll go in your house.</v>

73
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.750
I'm forcing you to get in the bath with your clothes on.

74
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.100
I want to judge this position. That's. I don't believe you.

75
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.570
<v 0>Yeah. We have one in the studio go in this one that one's tiny as well.</v>

76
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.433
That one's too.

77
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.040
<v 1>Yeah. But we'll get gone in there. What's going on? Yeah.</v>

78
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.210
<v 0>The other thing of like,</v>

79
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.130
I like the only times I've had barfs is in my home in England and I don't know,

80
00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:21.840
like the way okay. Like Jew. Okay. When you're in a bath,

81
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.460
do you put your legs towards the top or did you put like your back towards the

82
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.940
top legs, legs towards the towel animals fed back towards the top?

83
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.940
Because the top is always like, I don't know. I always have, like,

84
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.100
I don't know if it's just me, but sometimes,

85
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.540
sometimes I like accidentally hit the tap and it's either too hot or too cold.

86
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.020
And it just like ruins the entire vibe for me. You want the legs.

87
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.940
<v 1>There? Cause like you want to burn your back.</v>

88
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.820
<v 0>Yeah. I've actually done that before. And I think that's just,</v>

89
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.960
I don't think it matches [inaudible].

90
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.810
<v 1>So you're back at your parents' house. It wasn't that nice. Come on. Gone.</v>

91
00:04:54.811 --> 00:04:55.710
Come on. You can do better than that.

92
00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.600
<v 0>I mean, like, even if I'm in a nice hotel, I'm like, I don't take it away.</v>

93
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.930
<v 1>There's nothing better than an hotel. That is a big aspect. I agree.</v>

94
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.500
<v 0>That's like the only time where I'm exclusively, like showers.</v>

95
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.690
I'm going in that bar. Always, always, always.

96
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.430
I like the feeling of just having like water, like spraying on you. I dunno.

97
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.900
It's just like a nice go out into the rain. Honestly.

98
00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:22.950
I honestly like rain in Southeast Asia is

99
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.520
great. Okay. Cause I like, we, we, when we think of rain,

100
00:05:26.521 --> 00:05:29.640
we think of like cold depressing, British rain,

101
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.410
just it's like, God blew up raspberry and you, and I hate that for you.

102
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.510
Right. But in, in Thailand when it rains, it pause. Right.

103
00:05:39.511 --> 00:05:42.870
And it's probably like, and it's warm as well. It's like taking a warm shower.

104
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.760
It doesn't feel like you're just getting on.

105
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.113
<v 1>So humid.</v>

106
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.910
Cause it was doing that in Japan and the summit was raining and it was like

107
00:05:50.911 --> 00:05:53.160
deceiving because I'm like, finally I'll be cold. Yeah. But no,

108
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.400
it was just more heat directly applied to my skin. That's what I hated when,

109
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.273
when I went to.

110
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.130
<v 0>Uh, the Philippines, like for the first time and it was like, may,</v>

111
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:04.070
so it wasn't even like properly hot yet. But because it's,

112
00:06:04.071 --> 00:06:06.500
this is Southeast Asia, it's still hot in may.

113
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.060
And the moment I got outside my hair just turned into an Afro because of the

114
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:13.730
amount of humidity. And then there was a pool where we were staying.

115
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.020
So I was like, Oh, thank God.

116
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:17.660
I can finally jump in the pool and I'll call myself off. No,

117
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:21.020
because it was so humid outside. It was like walking into a puddle of.

118
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.280
Like it was, it was, it was horrible. I was, I like,

119
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.430
I like heated pools and not like regular poles,

120
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.700
but the temperature of this poll is like halfway in between of that.

121
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.740
And it was just like, lukewarm.

122
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.670
<v 1>What else makes you feel like someone is in it? It doesn't,</v>

123
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.600
it doesn't make the water feel clean. It's like perfect bacteria, temperature,

124
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.140
please feel real gross. Exactly.

125
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.980
That's why cold showers are like amazing. They are amazing.

126
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.090
That's why like when I used to swim in public pools,

127
00:06:49.091 --> 00:06:50.950
the best ones are like the ones that are initially cold.

128
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.280
But you get warm as you sweating. Cause that's like nice.

129
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.230
Cause it also forces you to keep swimming and you don't get too comfortable.

130
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.990
<v 0>The ones where you're just like, you feel the water and you're like, Oh,</v>

131
00:06:58.991 --> 00:06:59.590
that's called,

132
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.280
but I'm just going to commit and just fully jump in and submerge my body all at

133
00:07:03.281 --> 00:07:05.290
once. And then you'll find after that. Yeah.

134
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.410
<v 1>I'm like this. I can't believe you're an animal con.</v>

135
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.160
You can take them out of Thailand where you can't take the peasant. Sorry.

136
00:07:15.161 --> 00:07:18.670
Sorry. The Thailand though. I messed that up.

137
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:22.600
I have the superior taste. I'm just don't eat cross.

138
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.280
<v 0>I just want to exist happily. You know what I mean? That's that's.</v>

139
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.030
<v 1>I want you to exist correctly. God, I want you to use the day when you can.</v>

140
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:34.560
And I want you to take a bath every night, treat yourself, treat yourself.

141
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.730
Don't want better than that. I don't want a wet.

142
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.960
<v 0>You don't have to be wipe. That's what toilet paper was invented.</v>

143
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.320
I don't want wet fingers after a while. That's just.

144
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.980
<v 1>Pouring your out with your hands. What are you doing? Bailey in your hands.</v>

145
00:07:50.981 --> 00:07:55.300
Don't get wet. We use a day. Do they see? That is disgusting.

146
00:07:55.301 --> 00:07:56.140
That's why I hate it.

147
00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.100
<v 0>Yeah, I am using, he's just using his hands.</v>

148
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:05.020
<v 1>He's using the heat of friction to warm his back up to</v>

149
00:08:05.021 --> 00:08:09.310
evaporate the water, his cheeks. What are you doing? God, you know what?

150
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.040
I want to watch your after this. I want to see what you're doing.

151
00:08:12.041 --> 00:08:15.460
I need to judge your technique. You're doing it all wrong. do it. I'm ready.

152
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.103
reveal. Let's go.

153
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.110
We're going to go pro inside of the toilet bowl and see what's going now.
