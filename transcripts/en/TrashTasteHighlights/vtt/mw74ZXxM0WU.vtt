WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.590
<v 0>Well, yeah, so yeah, we,</v>

2
00:00:01.591 --> 00:00:05.670
so we have this thing called own cloves day.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:07.980
Well,

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.760
where we have like one day in like the term or something where we could just

5
00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.890
come in in our own clothes and

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.680
I was speaking to Sydney and apparently like she was in her high school.

7
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.100
They didn't have school uniform. No. Yeah. They,

8
00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:24.060
they just American high schools don't wear uniforms.

9
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.580
<v 1>Big brain because you always wear the same every day. Yeah. Right. It's great.</v>

10
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.210
<v 0>You have to worry about like, Oh,</v>

11
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:33.500
I want the same t-shirt for three days in a row because yeah. Yeah. That's,

12
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.910
that's, that's a big reason why.

13
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.340
<v 1>I didn't give a about fashion until like later in life.</v>

14
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.300
<v 0>Was just because most, most days of the year I was wearing a school uniform.</v>

15
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.710
You know what I mean? Although I say that the, the fashion,

16
00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:48.200
like whoever designed my school uniform,

17
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.950
like deserves a slap because like,

18
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.160
I guess so in our high school, like you have to wear,

19
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.300
there's a set piece that you have to wear from when your seventh grade to 10th

20
00:00:59.301 --> 00:01:02.840
grade. And then when you enter at 11th and 12th grade, you'll like senior.

21
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.830
So you get to wear like a, a senior blazer and like cans and like that.

22
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.930
The senior uniform is fine. It looks dope as.

23
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.110
It's basically just a suit essentially.

24
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.950
But the junior uniform is a, is a little,

25
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.820
because for one, uh, everyone has to wear shorts

26
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.560
because you know, it's hot, it's hot most of the year in Australia.

27
00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:28.460
So you wear shorts, but then on top of that, you have to wear long socks.

28
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.250
Like, yeah. I'm talking like up to like the, like me long socks,

29
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.420
like anime, like anime, like these like gray, like knitted,

30
00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:41.570
like long someone had a fetish. Someone had a face. So like,

31
00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:45.800
basically there's just these like seventh to 10th grade kids running around,

32
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.320
basically just only showing their knee was,

33
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.460
was your school run by like Herbert the pervert? I don't know. I mean,

34
00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.230
I'm not going to give it to that one, but yeah. So I hated that.

35
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.110
But, and of course, because you know, I went to a private school.

36
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.870
If you didn't weigh your thing properly, right. punished for it.

37
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.370
Look at this private school, see your shins.

38
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.850
You're going to get a slap for that. You pull your socks up. I was like, okay.

39
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.590
Yeah. So in, in British schools, it goes secondary school, no primary school,

40
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.930
then secondary school, then sixth form.

41
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.330
<v 1>Which is part of secondary school. You normally.</v>

42
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.130
<v 0>Kind of, kind of. So like our high school is secondary school when 64.</v>

43
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.910
<v 1>Like put together, that's like the set of the skip from two to six and then,</v>

44
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.800
okay. So, so it's called secondary school.

45
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.960
Cause it's the second school that you go to. So,

46
00:02:35.961 --> 00:02:39.890
and then you start at age 12 and then you can, Oh, it's mandatory now. Right.

47
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:43.910
You have to do six form now. Right. So used to be, you could leave at 16. Yeah.

48
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.020
And you could go and you know, you could go and work. Uh,

49
00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:50.450
and then it was always an optional, if you want to go to university,

50
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.360
you have to stay an extra two years. Yeah. Which normally has about,

51
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.100
at least in my school, like half the kids left.

52
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.180
<v 0>Yeah. 16. Yeah. So in Australia that would be junior high and senior.</v>

53
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.660
So it's like we have high school.

54
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.750
So we have primary school and high school as well in high schools from seventh

55
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:05.350
grade to 12th.

56
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.350
<v 1>Grade, seventh grade when you're like age 12.</v>

57
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.130
<v 0>13. And then you can leave at year 10, which is like,</v>

58
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:14.170
I guess the end of secondary for you guys.

59
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.320
And then the last two years is senior.

60
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.460
<v 1>And, and that's like 16 to 18 and that's 16 to 18. Yes.</v>

61
00:03:20.461 --> 00:03:24.570
That's what it's like in the UK. Um, and like when I was in sixth form,

62
00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:26.370
so I was in my last two years, uh,

63
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.700
they try to introduce to the school like blazes, cause we didn't have lasers.

64
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.490
We had blazes, we're a public school. So blazers were like, Oh,

65
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.403
we'll get a load of these people.

66
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.760
And there's like outrage because they were like, because right.

67
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.380
Here's the thing, the school uniform,

68
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.260
you can only buy from like a special place. Right. You can just get on Amazon.

69
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.490
Right. And they were charging like 70 pounds for the blazer.

70
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.790
And obviously this is a public school and 70 pounds, like a hundred bucks.

71
00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.030
And for some parents it's like way too box. So they were like, what the? No,

72
00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:57.090
we don't want to blaze up. There was a whole like outrage about it.

73
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.250
And then eventually they were like, fine, fine. Okay.

74
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.430
Because the older kids are leaving, they don't need to web blazes.

75
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.020
So I didn't have to web once. It was very fun.

76
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.890
<v 0>It wasn't mandatory. So mandatory is your school uniform. And uh,</v>

77
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.180
I was at a time. So we in, in England, we call it sixth form college as well,

78
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.560
which gets a bit confusing. When we say, when we say college,

79
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.540
we mean sixth form, but you can go to college. You can go to actual colleges.

80
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.230
Yeah.

81
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.950
<v 1>What college is in college college in the UK is a one or two years. Right.</v>

82
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.400
Of like a specialized thing that you can then use to.

83
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.160
<v 0>Well, we call that something different. No, we have,</v>

84
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.400
we have to college that's college, but we have six form college.

85
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.870
And then we have whatever preschool university is that is that called college as

86
00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:42.060
well. Leave those two, the same institutions, if I'm correct,

87
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.480
because in Australia we don't even call it college. Like we don't use that word.

88
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.210
<v 1>Well, colleges, that's why I'm an American say, are you going to college?</v>

89
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.660
You're like, yeah.

90
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.660
<v 0>No, no, no, no. We're going to universe. We're going to use,</v>

91
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.340
it's like the Winnie phooey college university,

92
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.300
because college is something entirely different separately. Yeah. Yeah. It is.

93
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.510
<v 1>Yeah. I mean, anyway. Yeah, they were outraged.</v>

94
00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:05.580
So half the half the school didn't have to web lasers and half the young kids

95
00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:08.160
did, you could just be like, you know, Hey,

96
00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:10.260
look at this little ten-year-old right. He's a little blazer.

97
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.760
<v 0>No, we loved the blades. Like the blaze was the best bit.</v>

98
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:16.920
<v 1>Cause we were because you weren't supposed to,</v>

99
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.040
but the teachers got so done with it that you could just wear hoodies over your

100
00:05:20.041 --> 00:05:20.874
school uniform.

101
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.100
<v 0>They must have like where the rules in this school, man, it's in the winter.</v>

102
00:05:26.101 --> 00:05:29.130
Right? Like if it was just a regular, just white t-shirt underneath,

103
00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:31.950
it'd be way too cold. Yeah. So sometimes you'd have like,

104
00:05:31.951 --> 00:05:33.900
you'd have to wear the blazer just to stay warm.

105
00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:36.090
Because the other option we had was this,

106
00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:39.930
like our school colors were black and red. So we had this,

107
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.180
like the evil school and like it was black and red. So like we had this, like,

108
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.900
if you didn't want to wear a blazer, you have to wear this bright red,

109
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.160
white light, like woolen, like sweat or something like that. It was green,

110
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.030
green. But yeah. Yeah. I know the exact color houses, like.

111
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.850
<v 2>Bright.</v>

112
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:01.160
<v 0>Red, like, like the reddest red you can think of.</v>

113
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:03.740
So you just stick out in a crowd. Right? I mean,

114
00:06:03.741 --> 00:06:07.940
at least you had like pretty colors. Ours was like drab purple. Yeah. But like,

115
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.580
yeah. But the problem was is that because it was like a Wolf thing.

116
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.330
It was so ichi. Like it doesn't matter how many times you wash that.

117
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.010
You're just like, I'm warm, but this.

118
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.390
So people were just like, it.

119
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:24.110
I'm just going to like spend the a hundred bucks on the blazer because I don't

120
00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:26.510
want to wear this. Her like grandma's sweat a.

121
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.050
Cause I remember in my sixth form, I knew,

122
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:32.210
I knew I was a grown up in my sixth form.

123
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.570
W we w we went to like the coolest thing for them because they let us wear our

124
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:40.330
own clothes. And this, this,

125
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.720
this was the big thing we were allowed to call our teachers by their first name.

126
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.170
Oh. That was like bringing up to the next level, man.

127
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.550
Like we could only do that, but like, it was, it was a kg gamble.

128
00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:56.270
Every time it was like, do I call you this? The Smith?

129
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:57.740
Or do I just call you James.

130
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.850
<v 1>One student did that in my class. And the immediate, like,</v>

131
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:01.803
what the do you call me?

132
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.290
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

133
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.710
<v 0>Especially towards the female teachers. It's like, it's like, uh, excuse me,</v>

134
00:07:08.711 --> 00:07:11.350
Margaret. And she's just like, what the? Yeah.

135
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:15.483
<v 2>Holy.</v>

136
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.040
<v 1>Bro. I remember I'm sorry. I just had this like flashback to something.</v>

137
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.430
I remember. I did like, uh, so we had to do a presentation during,

138
00:07:21.431 --> 00:07:24.700
what do you have registration in Australia for one where you basically,

139
00:07:24.701 --> 00:07:26.380
when you get to school, you do separate class,

140
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.680
like registration to say that you're here and you know, you've, you've arrived.

141
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.830
Like orientation, stuff like that. I guess. Yeah. Orientation, maybe Americans.

142
00:07:32.831 --> 00:07:35.350
It's like a quick 15 minute thing where everyone just goes and stuff.

143
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:40.310
<v 0>Oh yeah. I forgot what that was called. It was called like a home home,</v>

144
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.870
home, home class, home. We had a Welsh homeroom.

145
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.790
That's American. Now we call it a home.

146
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.550
<v 1>Well, we, my school would call it registration in English,</v>

147
00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.040
but I can get a wash word for it. That extra call. Right. there.

148
00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.850
But we just do like a short presentation, um, between like,

149
00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:00.700
it would always be one of the students presentation each day.

150
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.550
<v 0>Would you have to do a presentation on what you learned?</v>

151
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:04.720
There's some perfectly pretentious.

152
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.220
<v 1>Yeah. You can do a quick presentation about something you've learned that day.</v>

153
00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.360
Oh my God. That was awful. So I was like, I was like 14, right?

154
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.570
I w we all hated it. And this teacher was horrible. So my, my, my,

155
00:08:17.571 --> 00:08:20.260
my best mate in school had a really bad like, stuttering problem.

156
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.200
You got a lot better now, but everyone like loved this guy.

157
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:24.970
Cause everyone's wanted to see him do well.

158
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.990
And this one teacher was so rude to him about his stutter. And I was so,

159
00:08:28.991 --> 00:08:31.480
and everyone was like, yo, all my homies hate that teacher.

160
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.120
So we were all just like, we all took it in turns,

161
00:08:34.121 --> 00:08:37.180
like trying to see how much we control in these presentations.

162
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.210
I did a pro game of move. I was like, you know what?

163
00:08:40.211 --> 00:08:42.850
I'm gonna present nine 11 conspiracy theory.

164
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.570
<v 2>I, you know, I, you dog.</v>

165
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.410
<v 1>And I did ask, I think I got the teacher to believe me, but I'm not like,</v>

166
00:08:50.411 --> 00:08:55.410
so I came in, I was like moon lending fake. But what,

167
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:58.170
what is the biggest conspiracy theory like this? Like,

168
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.760
like Steve jobs in a tattoo. I was like, listen, look at this.

169
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.320
I did the wing dings thing with, uh, with the flight. And I was like, look,

170
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.970
it's two towers. And the star of Israel, I rest my case. I never,

171
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:15.750
almost like, everyone's like no way, because I was like 14,

172
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.770
that shisha wasn't there. It wasn't that they were like, what the?

173
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.370
This is insane. Wow. It was just so funny.

174
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:26.800
Cause I never got told off for that. Really? No, I think,

175
00:09:26.801 --> 00:09:29.970
I think for some reason I think they thought I was super genuine about my belief

176
00:09:29.971 --> 00:09:30.804
of this, but

177
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.280
he just said it with enough conviction that they were still like,

178
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.900
he must be right. It must be walking. Right.

179
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.020
It wasn't just like the Winn-Dixie I think said a bunch of other stuff,

180
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:40.890
but that was like the,

181
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:46.110
the big piece of evidence where I was like the wind Microsoft planned nine

182
00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:46.944
11

183
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.690
to the, I do not know how I got away with doing that because that is bad

184
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.610
hell. We didn't do anything during late home. Right.

185
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.190
<v 0>I, I feel like they,</v>

186
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.790
the school just implemented that to give the teachers their 15 minute smoke

187
00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:06.230
break before the beginning. Right? Like.

188
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:08.960
<v 1>It was one of those teachers, the one who did it.</v>

189
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:10.790
Cause we didn't have any lessons with that, but she was always that one.

190
00:10:10.791 --> 00:10:15.560
He goes like, you should be constantly learning and advancing yourself though.

191
00:10:15.561 --> 00:10:18.410
I want to play modern warfare too at home. prepare.

192
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:23.570
<v 0>Homeroom was just coming together and just getting on our iPhone stories and</v>

193
00:10:23.571 --> 00:10:26.420
playing doodle jump together like that. That was the only thing we did.

194
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:30.320
Wondering if we, I don't think I even had like a homeroom segment or session.

195
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.120
<v 1>Segment of segment of the school day or whatever you can think of life and</v>

196
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:40.100
episodes. Season one, season two.

197
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.400
Oh my God. I didn't have anything like that.
