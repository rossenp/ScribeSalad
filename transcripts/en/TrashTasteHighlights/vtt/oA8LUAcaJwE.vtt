1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>Again, with casino, it is extremely heavily regulated. Right?</v>

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.670
And you can win money.

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.140
Certain makes sense that you can't have the risk of winning money without losing

4
00:00:10.141 --> 00:00:12.360
money. Right. But with Dutcher games.

5
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.230
<v 1>Well, for some people though, manly that P and G is worth more than money. It.</v>

6
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.310
<v 0>Blew my mind, but it took like.</v>

7
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.870
<v 1>Serious. How many what's wrong with you?</v>

8
00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:26.960
Because that's Sarah put in your childhood does serotonin.

9
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.750
Cause like I've never cared about

10
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.340
those PMs. I've never cared about winning money. Cause like, you know,

11
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.880
to me, money, money has value. Like, Oh obviously like

12
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.210
you can't buy some WiFi's like that, that serotonin here,

13
00:00:47.211 --> 00:00:50.960
when you win like a character that you're actually emotionally attached to you,

14
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.270
you know what I mean? Cause people who win money casinos,

15
00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:55.220
they're not emotionally attached to this money.

16
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.110
I've I've had friends who have had actual, you know,

17
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.900
proper gambling problems as well. And I remember this, my,

18
00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.050
I knew a friend in a university who one day,

19
00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:10.970
one like 10,000 pounds in a casino could have paid off.

20
00:01:10.971 --> 00:01:14.750
His student loans could have, could have been like completely debt-free.

21
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.130
And within,

22
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.990
within three weeks he had spent the 10 K 10,

23
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.820
10,000 pounds on, on gambling, Muslim gambling. And he asked him,

24
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.840
dude, you could have invest this money. You could have used it like more wisely.

25
00:01:29.841 --> 00:01:33.170
You could have used it to better your life. Why did you spend it on gambling?

26
00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:35.180
Or why did you spend it so easily? And he said,

27
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.270
because I didn't care about it because he didn't earn it. Right. Cause,

28
00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:38.870
cause he,

29
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.540
cause he had no emotional attachment to the money cause he was just given it.

30
00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:45.090
So to him it just felt like it is the equivalent of just someone coming up to me

31
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.003
and be like, he's 10 K.

32
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.920
<v 0>Yeah. A lot of these, you know, the serotonin that you get from these wife,</v>

33
00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:50.030
who's three months say you don't give a.

34
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.960
<v 1>Well that's, that's, that's your prerogative.</v>

35
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.470
<v 0>I don't give a about some of the games that you pulled for and got that lovely</v>

36
00:01:57.471 --> 00:01:58.340
serotonin Hitler.

37
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.640
<v 1>No one. I mean I have Ivy goes to his like wall, like ah, yes.</v>

38
00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:07.760
I remember I had a good experience playing like,

39
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.870
Oh the gadget games I've played.

40
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.300
Otherwise I wouldn't have played them in the first place. It's like, you know,

41
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.980
small, basically the same as like going to a arcade or something. Right.

42
00:02:15.981 --> 00:02:20.690
And like putting money into that. Yeah. That's different now. It's different.

43
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.180
You're only paying, you know, maybe a hundred yen at, at a time,

44
00:02:23.181 --> 00:02:24.020
but it's still the same.

45
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.620
<v 0>The problem is that it's you could do a hundred yen at a time.</v>

46
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.570
If I wanted to spend 500 bucks,

47
00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:33.440
which I tried to do like five hours at a time.

48
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.070
If you want to spend 10 grand on Gacha give yourself 20 minutes.

49
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.130
<v 1>10 Grand in 20 minutes. Probably.</v>

50
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.520
<v 0>Good. If you were just buying this the highest option multiple times.</v>

51
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.980
<v 1>Bankruptcy, let's go baby.</v>

52
00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.950
<v 0>I'm sure. You know like,</v>

53
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.240
like you see the streamers who spent like 10 grand and without that make the

54
00:02:53.241 --> 00:02:55.130
money back. Yeah. Because I bought all the people who are doing that,

55
00:02:55.131 --> 00:02:57.110
who aren't making the money. Right. Um, yeah.

56
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.710
Some people were probably in the financial position to be able to do that. Yeah.

57
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.640
But why even give yourself the chance of like making that happen to other people

58
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:05.830
who aren't right. Like you here and again,

59
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:09.310
you hear the horror stories of kids spending their mother's money and like that.

60
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:11.380
Like why is this even able to happen? This shouldn't,

61
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.390
this should always be a hard limit built in that.

62
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:14.830
Shouldn't be able to like got beat up.

63
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.700
<v 1>Okay. Let, let me, let me ask you this on the person though.</v>

64
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.820
Let me ask you this. What regulations would you want to see then?

65
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.230
What regulations w how, how would you fix this problem that you've, uh, that,

66
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.100
that you've presented.

67
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.030
<v 0>When you download the game? Right? And there is Gachet in it.</v>

68
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.390
That should be an immediate question of what is the maximum you're willing to

69
00:03:33.391 --> 00:03:35.610
spend in like one year and you physically,

70
00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:37.230
no matter what you do cannot go over that.

71
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.840
<v 1>Like it will. What if you said zero and then you change your mind?</v>

72
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.340
<v 0>Well, that's on you. You've already said zero.</v>

73
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.390
<v 1>It's not the same as just putting in the credit card numbers by yourself.</v>

74
00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.253
Anyway.

75
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.340
<v 0>You've decided zero.</v>

76
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.440
You then can't hurt yourself more and you're stuck with the thing.

77
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.600
Cause you agreed to zero. I think that should be a thing.

78
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.600
<v 1>No, because like on, on the, on the other side,</v>

79
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.960
then that means spending money in, in essence is also on you. Right? That,

80
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.710
that, you know, that that's,

81
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.240
that shifts responsibility from just one place to another.

82
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.670
<v 0>Like the problem with the people have with,</v>

83
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.460
I think when they're talking about like gambling addicts is that we don't think

84
00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:09.780
of it. Cause we're not gambling addicts.

85
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.970
We don't think of it as why don't you just not spend money broke? That's not,

86
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.010
that's not how it works.

87
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.280
That's not how it like this is the problem is that I think people alienate these

88
00:04:17.281 --> 00:04:20.220
people and don't even remotely think how it is to be in that position.

89
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.340
<v 1>I totally understand. But at the same time,</v>

90
00:04:23.341 --> 00:04:26.250
it's what I'm trying to say is obviously they are,

91
00:04:26.251 --> 00:04:29.850
there are people that are proper gambling addicts that have a problem that they,

92
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.990
you know, physically, you know,

93
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.640
like cannot control all the time to control back. How would you,

94
00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:38.850
how would you introduce a system where, you know, how do you,

95
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.440
how do you introduce a system that's can regulate that, you know, as opposed to,

96
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.410
you know, other people who have, you know, no problem, you know,

97
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.770
having willpower and being able to control their spending and financial

98
00:04:49.771 --> 00:04:50.604
decisions.

99
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.240
<v 0>I do think that there should be a hard limit on monthly amount of money you can</v>

100
00:04:54.241 --> 00:04:56.880
spend on any game. I legitimately believe that.

101
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.140
I believe that I do not think that like anyone should have any excuse to spend

102
00:05:01.141 --> 00:05:04.170
over like $10,000 on a video game a month. Like that should be just,

103
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.250
that should be like a hard limit baked into the game or app store,

104
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.870
something like that because no one, realistically,

105
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.510
no one needs to spend over a grand. And if they do,

106
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.080
if everyone's playing by the same thing of no one can spend over the, a grand,

107
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.670
the dabs won't make games that are able to get benefit of spending over a grant.

108
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.690
You know what I mean? Like,

109
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.690
I don't understand why there hasn't been some kind of like hard limit on video

110
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.920
game spending like that.

111
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.820
<v 1>Because why would the devs [inaudible] I know.</v>

112
00:05:30.821 --> 00:05:31.950
I like, I, I that's,

113
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.880
that's probably the best solution I can like agree on because I do feel like

114
00:05:35.881 --> 00:05:37.380
there should be a hard limit on how much you can.

115
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.380
<v 0>I think there also should be something again with like how you can say,</v>

116
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.810
I want to quit like casinos because you know,

117
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.930
gambling addicts probably aren't gambling addicts, 24 seven.

118
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.180
It's probably like a lapse of like willpower where they're like,

119
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.130
I need to gamble some yeah, I'm depressed or something.

120
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:51.683
I don't know how it works,

121
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.590
but there should be something in the system that's like, okay, I want a gamble.

122
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.250
All right. And then you can say that, or at one point,

123
00:05:58.251 --> 00:05:59.720
when you download the game, say, I don't want to gamble.

124
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.840
You can only change this in say seven days of like, Oh, you sure?

125
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.020
So you say yes, I want to gamble. All right, come back in seven days.

126
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:09.020
If you're sure you want to gamble, we'll let you gamble. Right? Why not?

127
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:11.300
Something like that. Developers,

128
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.070
because most of the money I bet is spent is of air.

129
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.460
Everyone's a moment of weakness with that. Like, you know, it.

130
00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:21.070
I'll spend a hundred bucks on, you know what I mean?

131
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.750
Most often you spend a hundred dollars on the Gacha. If I had to ask you Joey,

132
00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:28.240
come back in seven days, tell me you still want to spend that a hundred bucks.

133
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.390
<v 1>One bothered with playing the game at that point, or you'd play it free to play.</v>

134
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.620
Yeah. Or not play it at all. I mean, I say more, more than anything.

135
00:06:35.621 --> 00:06:37.570
I'd probably not play it at all. Yeah. Well,

136
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.600
if you can't spend money in the game, well, no, if I'm, like,

137
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.820
if I'm persistently being asked, like, are you sure?

138
00:06:42.821 --> 00:06:44.110
Are you sure you want to do it? I'm just like,

139
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.340
I'm not even gonna bother with it then.

140
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.460
<v 0>Is that intrusive? What do you mean?</v>

141
00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:51.340
You won't let me spend my money on their furious. It's like, leave me alone.

142
00:06:51.341 --> 00:06:51.791
I'll spend it.

143
00:06:51.791 --> 00:06:55.120
If I want to spend it like the opposite now where they're like my money spend

144
00:06:55.121 --> 00:06:57.010
money, yogurt. Yeah. This packet, this packet deal.

145
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.120
<v 1>I'm like, I'll get the pack if I feel like getting the pack,</v>

146
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.730
but I'm not going to be like, what do you mean?

147
00:07:03.731 --> 00:07:05.980
You can just say no to the money thing. Yeah.

148
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:10.360
<v 0>You literally just said the same thing. You're just being an. Now.</v>

149
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.070
I literally, what gave you the opposite situation where I was like, spend money,

150
00:07:15.071 --> 00:07:17.350
spend money. And you're like, I'm fine. I don't want that. Yeah.

151
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.590
So what's the difference of saying, know what

152
00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.380
I'm going to be like? You're just playing devil's advocate just to me off. I.

153
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.510
<v 1>Love you off. It's my favorite hobby.</v>
