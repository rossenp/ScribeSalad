00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.720
<v 0>Going back to the topic of beds and everything opinions on pajamas.</v>

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.670
Do any of you guys wear pajamas? Like specifically, like pajamas? Yeah.

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.350
Just pajamas. No, for me, it's just like underwear and some random are good.

4
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:16.490
I don't understand pajamas at all. Um, yeah.

5
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.740
Some people do wear a t-shirt to bed. I don't want to wear it.

6
00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:22.970
Why would you wear it today? I mean, it's like stinking hot, like in the summer,

7
00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:24.170
like I'll, I'll wear no shirt,

8
00:00:24.171 --> 00:00:28.040
but most of the time max comfort is the least amount of clothes you could wear

9
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.670
basically. And like, you know, you basically only wear boxes, so you're,

10
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.980
you're dangly bits. Don't go everywhere. Yeah.

11
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.770
That's pretty much the only way freedom though, you know, let them loose.

12
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.880
I'm sleeping. I want to be comfy. No, I'm like, I dunno.

13
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.680
I like wearing a t-shirt because sometimes in the morning the weather can like

14
00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:49.400
completely change. So I don't, especially nowadays in the winter,

15
00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:53.120
like I'm a little bit too cold if I don't wear at least a t-shirt even with the,

16
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.240
even with the heater on. Yeah. But yeah. I don't know.

17
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.900
When you say you're like a friend's house, right? What do you do?

18
00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:02.510
Do you wear a t-shirt when you sleep? Cause I'm just like immediately. I'm like,

19
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.420
right. I'm stripping all day. It depends how close I am to that friend. Right?

20
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.850
I mean, it doesn't matter who it, who they are. I'm like right.

21
00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:09.620
If I'm staying in your house, I'm sorry. I'm asleep. Like,

22
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.760
I'll see with boxes on I'll humor. You, I won't get my junk everywhere.

23
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.460
I'll super boxes on my bike. You can just not wear a shirt.

24
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.900
I can't sleep with the t-shirt. Why? Why did I feel like I'm outside still?

25
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.950
You know what? I take the tissue off in my head at signifies, like, okay,

26
00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:26.600
we're going to bed or I'm going in the bath.

27
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.380
Are you the type of person who like, when doing like a serious, like heavy,

28
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.810
like you have to like take your shirt off. No, but wait, wait. No,

29
00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:39.260
I know. Yeah. Go, go, go, go, go. No,

30
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.460
if like, I, I had a few friends where like,

31
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.780
like if the pain was like really, like, it was such a powerful.

32
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.680
It'd be like to like fully get out like a hundred percent of that.

33
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.580
[inaudible] [inaudible] man.

34
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.290
I need to take my shirt off to get serious.

35
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.880
[inaudible] in camera. No way is serious Goku with

36
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.510
[inaudible] or something. It's like, hold on.

37
00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:17.660
Let me use a hundred percent of my power to push this because you're like

38
00:02:17.661 --> 00:02:21.470
sweating so hard. You're just like, I need to take my shirt off. Okay. Also,

39
00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:23.180
when, when you're, when you're like hungry,

40
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.700
when you're hung over the shifts, the shifts are terrible though.

41
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.060
So you're like. I mean, I just woke up I'm naked. So it. I'll do it.

42
00:02:32.061 --> 00:02:33.080
When I'm naked, I'm going to lie.

43
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.580
I've had moments where been so like powerful and stressful. I'm just like,

44
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.750
I have to take my shirt off.

45
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.650
I don't do that, but I know people live here. Not enough. It's like placebo,

46
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.020
but like it works. He's

47
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.010
Tyler on us. On the show. Yeah.

48
00:02:55.011 --> 00:02:59.380
The only time I, when I'm like, if I'm ever like vomiting,

49
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.120
I want to be naked because I want to get that anywhere or smell my clothes.

50
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:07.930
So I'm like, I'll just do it. And I'll hug this toilet bowl until I'm done.

51
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.370
You're hugging it. Then there's no way you're going to like onto your.

52
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.650
That in my clothes, my clothes at all, man. I'm like, I don't know. I just,

53
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.650
I also feels better. I dunno. Why feel it? Like I need to get,

54
00:03:18.651 --> 00:03:21.240
I didn't get like, it's too strict. I'm getting stuffing in these.

55
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.290
I just want to vomit. Like, I don't know, like when I was to have like,

56
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.273
did you follow me with that?

57
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.810
Because every time I've seen you bumping you have closed. Oh yeah, sure.

58
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.160
And I'm like, you know, if you have like, if you're really sick,

59
00:03:35.161 --> 00:03:38.070
you're like when I had food poisoning back at like, whenever I, you know,

60
00:03:38.071 --> 00:03:41.060
when they thought I had the Brona, like I was like vomiting. And like,

61
00:03:41.061 --> 00:03:42.630
I had to be like naked because I was like,

62
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.180
otherwise I feel like get on my clothes. And I'm like, that's gross.

63
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.730
It's so fun. Little. Did you know that during the chess tournament,

64
00:03:47.731 --> 00:03:51.630
every time you went to jail, he just rip off his suit. That was awful.

65
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.290
That with the suit on I'm like, please don't get it on the suit.

66
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.190
That's the worst timing to take a. It's winter enough slurry.

67
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.130
[inaudible] it was gross. No.

68
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.670
Cause like for me wearing a t-shirt in bed is just like sometimes,

69
00:04:08.671 --> 00:04:11.760
especially in the winter. Yeah. You wake up and it's like a cold morning.

70
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.590
I love that. And like, how do you escape your DV at that point? Yeah.

71
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.410
You just it's it's like, I don't know, being branded. You'd like just do it.

72
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.710
Do it for me. It's just like, gravity has increased tenfold.

73
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.270
I'm like experiencing 10 GS in this bed right now. It's like,

74
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.360
I actually can't get on. Literally takes me like an hour to get out of bed.

75
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.650
I have like the call of duty, like text, pop it up on my screen mission,

76
00:04:34.651 --> 00:04:38.760
get to the shallow. Like that's what it's like for me, one limb at a time to be,

77
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.690
let me, let me just get my right arm out. And once that's like room temperature,

78
00:04:42.691 --> 00:04:44.710
then I'll get my right leg out. It's like, all right now.

79
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.680
But I used to have like a heated thing that you could put into your bed. Right.

80
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.460
But that just made me lazy. So I got rid of it. What do you mean?

81
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.310
I never wanted to lie bad, like a heated thing under the mattress.

82
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.770
He was like just always warm. But then I was like, this is also a fire hazard.

83
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.910
Uh, and uh, yeah, I just don't. I can not get out of bed with this thing. Yeah,

84
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:06.480
that's true.
