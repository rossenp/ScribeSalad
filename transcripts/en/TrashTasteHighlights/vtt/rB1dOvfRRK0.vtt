00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.230
<v 0>Can we, can we talk about the real masterpiece airing the season though?</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.800
Oh, I'm Joey. Joey knows what I'm talking about.

3
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.430
I was just about to bring it up. I so, so forget it.

4
00:00:13.431 --> 00:00:15.920
Forget this attack on Titans Lando,

5
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.810
or like whatever we're going to call the classic.

6
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.550
The real classic that's coming out the season is an anime called X arm.

7
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.250
So I'm a, I'm a complete newb. Now I have seen clips of it,

8
00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:28.670
but can you please explain to me what arm is and it's totally,

9
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.590
it is hilarious. It is, um, experience.

10
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.360
I will say that. So I think we have literally got the mass effect,

11
00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:42.920
Andromeda releases of anime. You know what I mean? Cyber punk finish.

12
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.350
So this is, I didn't know, anime could have bugs and glitches.

13
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.340
That's all I'm going to say.

14
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.570
So is a crunchy roll original, right? And you know,

15
00:00:56.571 --> 00:01:01.160
that crunchy roll up proud of this because I have not seen a single piece of

16
00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.930
promotional work about this.

17
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.060
I saw the trailer on YouTube and I thought it was Joe and

18
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.530
the show looks worse than that. It looks,

19
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:15.590
it looks worse than I hate to say to you about the trailers.

20
00:01:15.591 --> 00:01:18.680
Probably the best part about the show, the trailer isn't the trailer.

21
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.390
The trailer is the animal that makes it good. Doesn't it? But it's so bad.

22
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.070
I was crying and laughter the first episodes is like,

23
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:31.070
I think the third lowest anime. Well,

24
00:01:31.071 --> 00:01:34.310
right now it is one episode of the one episode you're laughing.

25
00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:36.890
So it's a that's that's what,

26
00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:40.850
it's a masterpiece of trash basically. It's it's masterpiece.

27
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.990
It is a Mark. It's like, it's like the first time I watch like Gazi swing,

28
00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:46.760
right? Yeah. All like, you know, helped us give.

29
00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:48.770
And I was like a scale to heaven. I was like, this is,

30
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.190
I'm watching a masterpiece, but on the opposite. End of the so, so to,

31
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.520
to explain ex-army there's a control original anime, um,

32
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.570
that is made by a completely new studio by a team who's never worked in anime

33
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.170
before American, no Japanese Japanese team,

34
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.520
but they've never worked an animate before and it shows, okay. It shows,

35
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.760
it shows that they've never worked anatomy before. Um,

36
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.470
it is a 3d anime that looks like it was made by a

37
00:02:15.471 --> 00:02:20.120
five-year-old who just learned blender like yesterday. Um, it,

38
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.690
it makes Ruby look like it makes Ruby season one looked like an app's like

39
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.890
master. I was going to watch it,

40
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:28.040
but I just wanted to get like drunk enough just to like fully enjoy it.

41
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.280
[inaudible] 2016 looked like a Kira. You know what I mean? Yeah.

42
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:32.810
It's pretty bad.

43
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.290
And what's worse is that like I posted the clip of it on Twitter,

44
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.460
but like there's a scene right near the beginning where the main character is

45
00:02:40.461 --> 00:02:44.150
3d, but his brother is in 2d white.

46
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.060
So you have this truly awful CG,

47
00:02:50.061 --> 00:02:54.680
like blocky, Minecraft character starting next to this 2d anime character.

48
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.400
He literally in the same scene in the same shot. And he literally looks,

49
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.570
he looks green screened on, you know what I mean?

50
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:02.830
It looks like someone just learned,

51
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.880
it looked like someone just had learned this, the chromic he's like, yo,

52
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:08.770
you heard of this thing called a chroma key X.

53
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.630
You can see it on screen right now. God that's awful.

54
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.330
You know what that is? That's like, that looks like if you told me that was, uh,

55
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.110
what's that, uh,

56
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.450
what's that game where everyone can have their own avatars in the game.

57
00:03:27.451 --> 00:03:31.950
It looks like the like second life, whatever it's called, it looks like if like,

58
00:03:31.951 --> 00:03:32.350
you know how,

59
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.920
like someone other people have their own servers and they have like 2d things

60
00:03:34.921 --> 00:03:37.470
and they have like the 3d models. That's what it looks.

61
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.161
You know what that looks like.

62
00:03:38.161 --> 00:03:41.640
That looks like someone took like a regular animate and made like an MMD edit of

63
00:03:41.641 --> 00:03:45.000
it. I can see it. Cause it is like that quality

64
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.870
[inaudible] on my MMD. And then like, if, if that wasn't already bad,

65
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.070
there was just like some of the fight choreography is just hilarious.

66
00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:00.480
Like this is one fight scene.

67
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.540
I think like it's like the last fight scene of the first episode where there was

68
00:04:03.541 --> 00:04:07.620
just no music. It's like, they forgot to put in the music. It's just like,

69
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.210
like that, but there's no music whatsoever. So it's just,

70
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.770
I was watching it and I was just like,

71
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.910
there's something wrong with my headphones? Like why is there no music playing?

72
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.980
I remember like in the last fight they, they run out or something.

73
00:04:22.981 --> 00:04:25.970
And it's literally a guy who looks like it looks like it. Literally,

74
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.650
it looks like the characters are like being animated with a stick or something

75
00:04:28.651 --> 00:04:30.330
like that. There's literally no,

76
00:04:30.331 --> 00:04:32.040
like they're not moving their limbs or something.

77
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.570
They're just like rocking from side to side. So are we talking that like that,

78
00:04:36.571 --> 00:04:38.490
like queen bee would put them to shame. Oh,

79
00:04:38.491 --> 00:04:42.570
I wish this was out of Macy by queen. It makes queen bee look like studio weird.

80
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.120
It's horrible. Yeah. But it's also just a really fun time.

81
00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:51.450
Like I had a lot of fun watching the first episode. I mean,

82
00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:54.150
I want to get some drinks and just enjoy it, you know? Oh, we need to,

83
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.980
this would be like even better if it had like kind of like a ghost stories,

84
00:04:58.981 --> 00:05:03.450
dub it's like someone needs to dub Exxon, like crunchy roll, please.

85
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.530
Don't be ashamed of XRM. You are sitting on a golden duck here just,

86
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.670
just marketed correctly. And people will mean the out of us.

87
00:05:11.671 --> 00:05:15.810
The rights to Dobbin, Waldoboro, dove. It all make an amazing double bed.

88
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.300
You know what I mean? Can't wait to direct those sessions

89
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.180
and like the opening song as well. Just what is that?

90
00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:28.350
The one that sounds like some, some 41. It sounds like, it sounds like a,

91
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.550
some 41 cover band. I heard that was the one that used for the trailer, right?

92
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.390
Yeah. That is just the animation tied to sent me it. And he's like, what the is

93
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.730
[inaudible] yeah. What the? What is this? God. It's like,

94
00:05:41.731 --> 00:05:44.250
it's like a high school band that listened to too much green day.

95
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.173
You know what I mean?

96
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.830
It does sound like a cover band. Oh my God. That is perfect.

97
00:05:52.831 --> 00:05:54.510
But so why is no one talking about that?

98
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.100
You have a tackling type of season four, but who gives a about how,

99
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.460
who greenlit that? Like, I know, sorry. Like who,

100
00:06:00.461 --> 00:06:02.840
who let that through like quality assurance?

101
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:05.390
Like who led that through what qualities of what I'm saying?

102
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:08.330
Like there's normally people who are like, yeah, this is good to go. Who,

103
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.400
who dead watched that first episode was like, yeah, it's good. I wonder though,

104
00:06:12.401 --> 00:06:14.710
if someone at like the production team was like,

105
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.780
I feel like we're forgetting something QA. Oh. Sometimes when like,

106
00:06:19.781 --> 00:06:23.140
people like make shows, but it's just one big like tax fraud, scheme.

107
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.200
What a fruit slide. I shouldn't say that I could get in trouble.

108
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.780
It's definitely a joke. It's a joke, you know, just saying,

109
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.210
Oh my God. But like, I wonder what the people working on it think of this,

110
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.740
you know what I mean? Cause you know, sometimes,

111
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.850
sometimes you work on a project that you're proud about.

112
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.620
You know what I mean? Because

113
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.920
people want to get paid God at the end of the day. They're like, I mean,

114
00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.290
I got to just keep turning up and doing what they ask. Right.

115
00:06:53.291 --> 00:06:54.820
That's what I imagined happening. I don't know.

116
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.880
I just like to imagine that like the animators came back to the,

117
00:06:57.881 --> 00:07:01.720
like the produce and was like, yeah. Th th the models look great. Um,

118
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.550
so like put some shading on there,

119
00:07:03.551 --> 00:07:05.530
put a little more animation on the producer's light.

120
00:07:05.531 --> 00:07:08.350
So it's coming out tomorrow. I just want, I just want to know, because you know,

121
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.830
and like in any like anime production or any big project production, you know,

122
00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:15.730
you have this, you have this screening nights, right? Where you as a group,

123
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:19.420
as the team, you get to watch the final product before it airs.

124
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:24.430
I just want to hear the silence in that room when the credits roll and

125
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.500
you just, you just want, what can you say, psych in Japan,

126
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:30.640
it's always silent.

127
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.290
That's what I see in America and the West. We have clapping.

128
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.980
I just liked the thing that the entire like screening room is just like silently

129
00:07:38.981 --> 00:07:43.380
nodding their head. They're like, hell yeah, everyone knows every Japanese man,

130
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:44.530
just waiting for the [inaudible]. Anyway, come on. I want to be a man, the

131
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:44.530
 screening and free drinks. So it doesn't matter like that, that turning

132
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:44.530
 up to the screen. I turn up to the screening. If I get free meal at the end of it, listen, man, like as someone who's like, you know, 

133
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:44.530
done a documentary in anatomy studio, I completely [inaudible]

134
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:44.530
. I get it. It's hard, but also come on. It's hard. But come on, man. It's hard. You know, we're not, we're not blaming the 

135
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:44.530
problem at all

136
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:44.530
. I'm not blaming anyone for it. If anything, I'd like to thank them for giving us 

137
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:44.530
something like quality entertainment. Honestly, it is

138
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:44.530
 honestly quality. I didn't say I, I watched episode two and it is also a banger. Just coming out with 

139
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:44.530
an episode, man. XR episode two is one I'm looking forward to.
