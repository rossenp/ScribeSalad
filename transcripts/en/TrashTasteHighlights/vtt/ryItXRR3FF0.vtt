1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.600
<v 0>I got to ask, because you grew up in France and moving,</v>

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.820
you know about, you know, how much,

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.640
well you were telling us earlier about how much more we can get paid,

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.030
doing the same job being in France and all of us also having,

5
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.280
let's say less work hours as well.

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.200
What made you decide to give that up and moved to Japan?

7
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.630
<v 1>Um, have like a, when I turn my, you,</v>

8
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.470
my story of my internship, uh, uh, to my friends,

9
00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:29.030
I can,

10
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.250
do you really want to go to Japan or maybe shoe because me, I don't want,

11
00:00:34.251 --> 00:00:38.500
I want to, I want to have a life. I, I could completely understand, you know,

12
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.940
there is no, this is the right way and not, so you have,

13
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.660
uh, everybody had, uh, his way of doing it.

14
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.580
And in my case,

15
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.480
I wanted to work in Japanese animation industry because

16
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.490
I like animation. I like manga. Uh, and, uh,

17
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.530
yes, there is some Singh, cocaine and D a bit, sorry. Muds are cheesed

18
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.380
that's. Yeah, but, uh, yeah, it's, uh,

19
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.310
the way to learn also, this is kind of.

20
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.790
<v 0>It's just purely passion driven.</v>

21
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.850
It just sounds like you are doing it purely for the past.

22
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.620
I was going to say for that pay, you better be passionate.

23
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.640
<v 1>But, uh, yes, but I mean, any mission, the two or three years are hard.</v>

24
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.150
So if you want to do a career in Japan,

25
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.110
so you have to speak Japanese, you, you can, uh,

26
00:01:36.111 --> 00:01:39.650
manage to work in Japan with English, but, uh,

27
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.340
just as some few study, we open the doors because they have a translator or not.

28
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.130
And, but if you can speak Japanese more open doors we offer.

29
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.370
<v 0>Right. And as we've established, like, you know, from your stories is that,</v>

30
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.090
you know, getting to know the people as well, it just takes you so far.

31
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.000
It really does seem that like, if you do speak Japanese,

32
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:01.520
it's like way easier to get into the anime industry than I hate people,

33
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.990
make it out to be, it's definitely an easy mode. Isn't it? I mean, it's,

34
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.110
it's the same moving to any country and turning their industry. Right.

35
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.270
I think you almost find it.

36
00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:14.030
People put like the anime industry on like a pedestal, right? It's like,

37
00:02:14.031 --> 00:02:15.950
it's the anime industry. It's mythical, it's Japanese.

38
00:02:15.951 --> 00:02:18.500
We don't know what happens. Right. But then when you talk to people, it's like,

39
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.540
oh yeah, I got paid like two years of frame. It's.

40
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.980
<v 2>Like going back to the.</v>

41
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.680
<v 0>The, the story of the guy who, you know,</v>

42
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.990
came up and said like that he wanted to work at trigger.

43
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.190
<v 2>Guarantee. He has no idea what it's like to actually work in.</v>

44
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.680
<v 0>True. It's like, it's like six o'clock. He's like ready to go home.</v>

45
00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:35.740
And everyone's like, no, no, there's four more hours.

46
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.830
<v 1>Yes. In Japan you have a Dango and uh, you saw,</v>

47
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.600
you can just say, oh, you can leave the study at eight, but no,

48
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.323
exactly, exactly.

49
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.170
<v 0>You can leave at eight and then you'd see nobody leaves leaving at the clock-out</v>

50
00:02:54.171 --> 00:02:57.620
times in Japanese companies. This is not an official clock-out time.

51
00:02:57.621 --> 00:03:00.070
It's like a suggested yeah. All the time. But.

52
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.210
<v 1>Yeah. So, so when I was, uh, walking in graffiti camp,</v>

53
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.730
and first I, in my mind, I say,

54
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.770
one year we see how one year will be too hard or

55
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.480
we'd go back to France and yeah. Faster one year.

56
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.380
And okay. My sink, I couldn't do a one plus one like that. When you,

57
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.870
when you have on the yard and no, it's, I'm,

58
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:27.850
I'm at my five years and yes, I, he, his tutor. I,

59
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.290
yeah, I know. I have found a good study or foresee. Um, I learn a lot of,

60
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.860
from my same pies and yeah, I, uh, I can do more, more.

61
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.350
<v 2>How much longer do you think though? Because you, you.</v>

62
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.320
<v 0>Said you were 31, right? Yeah. Still doing all night.</v>

63
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.140
<v 1>Uh, yeah. It's lunchtime, but you can not do that. Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.390
<v 2>I was going to say, cause like, I've just hit my thirties as well. And man,</v>

65
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.170
all nighters, they are deaf. They definitely hit different your body.

66
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.620
[inaudible] because when you're 20, you a few cans of red bull,

67
00:04:01.621 --> 00:04:03.840
it's easy, 48 hours.

68
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.110
<v 1>It was younger getting your drink at night and you go to work does a day. Yeah,</v>

69
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.003
it was okay. No.

70
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:13.950
<v 2>No. It was like 11:00 PM.</v>

71
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.600
<v 0>Definitely do find that my willpower is over exerting my body. I'm like, no,</v>

72
00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:20.260
I can do this diet.

73
00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.270
<v 1>Yeah. So you have to push yourself. And like I said, um,</v>

74
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.040
so it's a lot of hours you are sitting. And sometime I was,

75
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.290
I don't think there were,

76
00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:36.210
because I had a lot of pain in my feet because of her was because

77
00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:41.010
I was always sitting, sitting. And so the amount of, uh,

78
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.780
water, water, blood on my ankle was swollen.

79
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.170
<v 2>God. So that's what happens.</v>

80
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.000
<v 0>You know, when you're like sitting in a plane for a long time. Oh,</v>

81
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:52.834
I guess it is.

82
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.420
<v 1>And so I had to get up and walk because it's about painful.</v>
