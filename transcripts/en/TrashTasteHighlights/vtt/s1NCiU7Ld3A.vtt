1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.580
<v 0>I wonder, do you guys want to talk about attack on Titan?</v>

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.640
Because Twitter's funny right now, Twitter is funny.

3
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.070
<v 1>I mean, what is there to talk about? Like, I didn't realize.</v>

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.600
<v 0>How much for the clown Fiesta Twitter is about attack on Titan. How,</v>

5
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.740
how is, how have people turned this into a thing to like dislike?

6
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.730
I don't understand.

7
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.631
<v 1>I don't,</v>

8
00:00:20.631 --> 00:00:24.200
like I knew there was something wrong when I woke up in the morning and went on

9
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.980
to Twitter. Hashtag thank you. Mapa was training. I was like,

10
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.660
what the are these clowns doing now? It's like, every time,

11
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.250
every time I'm talking to Tyson air,

12
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.100
or you go on Twitter and something about attack on Titan is trending. Yeah.

13
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.030
<v 0>So the time of recording is episode six schema.</v>

14
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.700
<v 1>Yeah. Yeah. And basically the most recent thing that happened was, uh,</v>

15
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.690
what was it? People, people on Twitter were just attacking the staff members.

16
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.940
They were what's wrong. Like I think,

17
00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:57.410
I think what I've read was some people were just harassing the director for one

18
00:00:57.411 --> 00:01:01.490
of the music choices that was, that was made, um, in one of the big scenes.

19
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.170
And it got so bad that he had to deactivate his Twitter. He did. Yeah.

20
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.640
And a bunch of animators as well.

21
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.820
<v 0>I'm literally watching this thing. Like, this is amazing.</v>

22
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.510
Why are people getting angry? Like, is there like, what was wrong with the song?

23
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.830
<v 1>Like who the knows? It's like,</v>

24
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.470
I'm losing words because it's so so and dumb that you do

25
00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:27.530
that you don't deserve anime. I'm just saying right now, like you just,

26
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.590
you just don't deserve it. Ain't a real animal, not a real anime fan.

27
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.460
If you turn off.

28
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.060
<v 0>My mind, is that like, at the end of the day, a lot of these people, right?</v>

29
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.630
We're just, we're just anime fans. Why on earth?

30
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.170
Do you think you have the right to that? Just go to like the director level.

31
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.643
I hate.

32
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.750
<v 1>I will Udacity it a bit. Like you try and make an enemy. I see how you,</v>

33
00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:50.930
if you can make a good light, you know, what I want to do is like,

34
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.400
I just want to like kind of,

35
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.390
cause I think one of the things I saw yesterday was people were complaining

36
00:01:56.391 --> 00:01:59.750
about, uh, one of the Titans being like really bad CGI.

37
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.920
<v 0>And watching this thing. Right. And the CGI is honestly like barely noticeable.</v>

38
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.290
It's really like, not even remotely.

39
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.710
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

40
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.170
I just want to like go off to all those people complaining about the CGI and

41
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:12.650
like link them to any scene from like bozo of 2016. Yeah. This one.

42
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.170
<v 0>Well, whoever will take the clip. Right. And then run it through Sony Vegas,</v>

43
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.800
call it 4k. And re-upload it. And be like, this is a 4k fight scene guys.

44
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.680
<v 1>Like it's.</v>

45
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.030
<v 0>It's absolutely absurd.</v>

46
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.690
<v 1>[Inaudible] the descriptions like I fixed this fight. Dumbest thing.</v>

47
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.043
Don't do that.

48
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.950
<v 0>I, I, yeah. I mean, I was,</v>

49
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.710
cause I tweeted out saying St like it nice and tight and be ready to be carrying

50
00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:46.220
20, 21. Obviously not being a hundred percent serious about that. I'm not,

51
00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:47.870
I'm not literally sitting there being like my 20,

52
00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:50.900
21 would be ruined if attack on Titan. Wasn't Eric.

53
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.850
Like my God, the arguments that arose in there.

54
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.980
<v 1>I, I made like, I made like an attack when Tyson tweet immediately muted it.</v>

55
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.890
I was just like, I I've,

56
00:03:01.891 --> 00:03:05.980
I've done this enough times before to know that saying anything about the attack

57
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:08.470
on Titan, whether positive or negative, you just set up,

58
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.850
you just set up a minefield.

59
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.070
<v 0>It's like, I, you know, I tweeted it. I came back four hours later. And then,</v>

60
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.680
you know, as I'm, you know, cause you refresh your Twitter,

61
00:03:16.681 --> 00:03:17.970
you see the most recent reply.

62
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.570
And it was something about like Japanese whaling laws that they were arguing

63
00:03:21.571 --> 00:03:22.950
about. And then I clicked on it.

64
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.340
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

65
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.300
<v 0>I click on this thing and it goes up like 50 replies back and forth.</v>

66
00:03:30.301 --> 00:03:31.680
These two people going at it,

67
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.190
because one of them said that like [inaudible] season two was going to be

68
00:03:35.191 --> 00:03:39.900
better. And they somehow devolved into like an attack on Japan. And I was like,

69
00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:43.350
what the is past people have like anything else? I just,

70
00:03:43.351 --> 00:03:48.000
I just don't understand how people can be angry about like a great

71
00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:51.990
thing. Like even if they're CGI in it, that is barely noticeable.

72
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.920
What's wrong. It's getting adapted and it looks good. We're getting bored.

73
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.350
I don't understand why people are being so pathetic.

74
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.340
<v 1>I feel like this is coming from the perspective of a lot of,</v>

75
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.720
let's say more like entitled margaritas, right?

76
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.990
Cause you can be disappointed in some ways of anatomy adaptation, because there,

77
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.221
there,

78
00:04:10.221 --> 00:04:14.460
there are some times when you read a manga and you have an imagination about how

79
00:04:14.461 --> 00:04:15.600
this Mongo is going to play out,

80
00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:19.590
if it was animated and with something like attack on Titan where the bar by

81
00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:23.940
studio wits was set so high, right.

82
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.950
That you go to mapper,

83
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.420
which I still think mapper is doing fantastic job. We've had bankers.

84
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.900
So we we've had fun making bangers. And what I will say is like,

85
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.270
it's like the tiniest of nitpicks, right.

86
00:04:36.271 --> 00:04:40.140
Where I would say that it's gone from like a 10 hour,

87
00:04:40.141 --> 00:04:44.510
10 adaptation to like a nine out of 10 adaptation. That,

88
00:04:44.511 --> 00:04:46.170
that that's that's, that's the thing. Right? It's it's,

89
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.070
it's a very slight step down from where it it's not bad by any step.

90
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.070
It's just a very slight step down. It's like, like, well,

91
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.850
people are taking that as if it went from like a 10 to a one. Exactly. Right.

92
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.080
And the thing is, it's a nine out of 10 adaptation for 10 out of 10 material.

93
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.080
You're still getting a banger. I don't get it.

94
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.530
<v 0>Seven deadly sins, season three. So I don't,</v>

95
00:05:06.531 --> 00:05:10.110
I really do not understand the problem here. And like, you know,

96
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.820
these are the people who were, uh,

97
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.540
getting this nitpicky on Twitter and those manga readers are the exact same kind

98
00:05:15.541 --> 00:05:18.540
of people who are just like when their kid's born. If that kid up anything,

99
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.000
they're like, well, it's ruined, it's fine. I, you know,

100
00:05:21.001 --> 00:05:22.950
my expectation should have. You know what I mean? It's real.

101
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.320
<v 1>Just like this is unlike what was in the hall, basing it off their own.</v>

102
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.320
<v 0>If it, if the child out that like, well, it. Didn't stick.</v>

103
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.810
<v 1>By looking at the ultrasound. They're seeing the baby born. It's like, well,</v>

104
00:05:33.811 --> 00:05:35.940
that's not, that's not, that's not a good adaptation.

105
00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.660
<v 0>You're telling me it's not going to be six foot. Honestly.</v>

106
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.460
<v 1>Just put it exactly the same.</v>
