1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.170
<v 0>He did toilet seats.</v>

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.410
The first time I went to Japan and try to heat the toilet seats. I'm just like,

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.150
how is the rest of the first world cut? Like other first world countries have.

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.320
<v 1>Yeah, I won't lie. I think I have actually ruined toilets to myself.</v>

5
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.600
Cause whenever I go to a toilet, now that doesn't have a bad day,

6
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.260
I legit feel like I'm having a panic attack. I legit feel like,

7
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.170
how am I supposed to wash my? Clean, wipe it. Are you kidding me?

8
00:00:21.171 --> 00:00:24.230
I'm not an animal. I don't touch that area. Do I,

9
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.650
if I haven't moved back to the UK, no joke. I'm a hundred percent.

10
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.840
The suitcase is empty, dude.

11
00:00:29.841 --> 00:00:34.760
I'm making room for the premium $1,000 a day because I'm using that daily.

12
00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:36.980
I want to like a King. And like,

13
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.310
I remember prosey D I was talking to him as well. One time he was like, dude,

14
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.470
when he went back from when he came back from Japan,

15
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.200
the one thing he brought was a bad day for real, because he was like,

16
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.010
I insist he has taste, man. He was arguing. He's like,

17
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.020
I insist that I like a King. And I'm like, honestly, I completely understand it.

18
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.350
Cause once you get used to a bad day and you get the heated seat, you know,

19
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.030
you get the, you get a little pressure washer. You can have it set to like,

20
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.560
boom, boom, boom, boom. They go back and forth on your cheeks. It's nice. Yeah.

21
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.990
I might ask for you to permanently clean.

22
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.840
Why wouldn't I want a shower for my every time I should. Like,

23
00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:11.360
are you kidding me? Sometimes I don't even, but I do it cause I'm like,

24
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.630
why don't you.

25
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.050
<v 0>Clean my? I know I got full time.</v>

26
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.080
<v 1>I want to make my feel refreshed because you know, sometimes right, man,</v>

27
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.640
you have those days where like it's a hot day. You get like swamp pass.

28
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.250
You know what I mean? We you're asked, just gets kind of sweaty.

29
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.880
It's not even bad, but just a little bit. You're like, why not just click it?

30
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.850
<v 0>[Inaudible] okay. I completely missed on this. It's just like,</v>

31
00:01:33.851 --> 00:01:34.760
you're not talking about it.

32
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.770
<v 1>Heated. The heated seat is also amazing,</v>

33
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.830
but you're talking about because the [inaudible] and the heated seats,

34
00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:42.350
part of the payday package, right? Even the cheapest one. Okay.

35
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.210
<v 0>I don't use the washing washing day at all.</v>

36
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.840
it just, it just doesn't feel clean. I don't know.

37
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.860
Cleanest thing in the toilet. It does not. I like, are you kidding me?

38
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.540
Okay. So you, so this going to space with me, like yeah. I never looked up

39
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.093
[inaudible] right.

40
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.370
But the water shooting up your and then you stop here and then you just got to.

41
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:11.870
You just go, you just got wet.

42
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.020
<v 1>She gets some of the toilet paper and you just dry it a little bit.</v>

43
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.883
You dry it off.

44
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.310
<v 0>Yeah. Because like you need the toilet paper,</v>

45
00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:21.740
but it doesn't feel clean without that wipe.

46
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.050
<v 1>Yeah. But okay. But some of them, that's what you have to watch.</v>

47
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.850
Some of them have dryers and those are pretty good.

48
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.350
<v 0>No, no, no. I have. You tried. Have you tried? I have tried. I have.</v>

49
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.240
<v 1>No, no, no. Okay. Yeah,</v>

50
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.790
because this is a difference between wiping to dry or why are we talking about

51
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.770
this? It's a different soup. Why pizza? Dry your and wiping to get the out.

52
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.110
Yeah. They're very different types of wipes.

53
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.330
<v 0>Right? One is, one is like a deep.</v>

54
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.280
<v 1>Excavation is a Pat down. Look.</v>

55
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.810
<v 0>Look, toilet papers were not designed to wipe wet arses. No,</v>

56
00:02:53.811 --> 00:02:54.680
because you're asking us.

57
00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.030
<v 1>This. Isn't the like Amazon river dude. It's a, it's a little moisture. What.</v>

58
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.210
<v 0>I hate is when, when you have a wet after day, you go to,</v>

59
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.220
you got to wipe it and the toilet paper just disintegrates on your house.

60
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.930
You like using how much,

61
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.370
how much water can your in blessable position contained. And second of all,

62
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.650
toilet paper. Why are you using God? Why are you using one ply sandpaper?

63
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:23.740
What are you using to absorb? You got to use the double, double minimum.

64
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:28.240
Come on. What I will supply.

65
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.940
How many sheets of paper is used in it? Easy. Like one square and be like.

66
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.620
It doesn't matter.

67
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.050
And anyone who lives in Asia knows that toilet paper here is weak as

68
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.220
is you sound broke right now gone. [inaudible] I thought like,

69
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:49.110
cause I thought he was just,

70
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.900
it was just a tie thing where toilet paper was just like flacid. No,

71
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.640
I moved to Japan and toilet paper here is like weakened. You can't buy the good.

72
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.140
Yeah. You get the Double-Play.

73
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.290
And then you do like maybe like one wrap around your hand.

74
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.830
That's more than enough to absorb any amount of liquid that's down to pile on

75
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:08.530
three little sheets. Right? That's a nice thickness to it. Right.

76
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:12.670
That to at least like that. And then just get onto that one rip. Good.

77
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.400
And your is clean and it's dry. I cannot believe you would come here. Like,

78
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:20.710
cause honestly, but days in the top three things about Japan,

79
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.470
I'm going to be honest with you. He didn't told us seats, but days the hook,

80
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:27.910
your whole experience, top three, the whole toilet experience,

81
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:31.150
like a top three Japanese thing for me, man. Like it's just great. Okay.

82
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.750
I'll look forward. Another thing about bodies as well.

83
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.630
Like it shoots up right up your. All right. That's exactly what I want.

84
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.720
And then you just feel like you have your you're out water.

85
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.270
And so like keep this

86
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.950
water stuck in your or

87
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.830
are you like giving yourself like a prostate massage on a bit daily?

88
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.820
It just like, which is not because they get bought a stuck in your Amos.

89
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.220
How do you do that? It's your,

90
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.540
you are you, are you putting your all over the body? Are you,

91
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:11.374
are you putting it?

92
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.510
Putting the hose in the stream of water is the strong enough?

93
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.110
You probably sent it to like pressure hose, public fountain.

94
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.280
Because if it's not strong, then it's just a trick on your.

95
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.380
And that's not cleaning up shoes called medium.

96
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.430
You need the pressure to clean that up.

97
00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.400
But if it has enough pressure to clean the off your,

98
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:40.960
then you're getting water stuck in your

99
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.610
[inaudible] is on the max pressure. And it's perfect because,

100
00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.590
because you can feel the coming off. And I mean, I don't know about you,

101
00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:57.570
but my is knocking ironclad right here, man. Clench,

102
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.410
clench that you know, cleaning it properly when you're,

103
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.090
what do you mean? You're not cleaning it properly when you clench

104
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.950
clench. When you clench, when you day that. I said like,

105
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.990
look her up a little bit. God is like,

106
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.880
God is like, relax. My owners allow the water to flow in.

107
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.750
Like you're giving yourself a like,

108
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.590
[inaudible] it feels like I'm getting it. I'll take a big day.

109
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.300
Enema every time it's totally wrong. Because like,

110
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.070
I don't clench when I. What do you mean? What are you just like?

111
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.580
I let gravity do its work fun. Slip. The slides

112
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.910
[inaudible] we might clench. You would just mean push. Yeah. Punch.

113
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:50.803
That's the same thing.

114
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.350
Normally that kid that doesn't help with the day still goes up the. Even,

115
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.550
even if you push that.

116
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.980
<v 1>Out, the anatomy of your, I.</v>

117
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.240
<v 0>Need it. We need an x-ray of your day cam just to see like what,</v>

118
00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:05.090
like how loose your all is when he gets to the date. Like,

119
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.370
I just don't like the feeling of like water on my. And I dunno.

120
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.420
What about in the shower? What are you cleaning your with? No. Okay. So you,

121
00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:16.910
you know, you know, when you clean your gone, I cleaned my.

122
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.010
You talked about the sweaty,

123
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.790
you talking about the sweaty fitting and your swamp pass. If I guess one pass,

124
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.870
I just take a shower.

125
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.620
So unnecessary. I can take, I can take three showers takes one.

126
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.290
<v 1>It goes home. He's like, got a shower now.</v>

127
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.010
<v 0>Honestly, honestly like sometimes if I want to feel clean after a,</v>

128
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.490
I just take a shower, man. Quick five quick, five minute.

129
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.330
What are you doing in these toilet? You're like you gone gone is that one too.

130
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.680
<v 1>Usually when you leave some public restrooms, it's like a war zone.</v>

131
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.930
<v 0>I must be gone. That that is not the everywhere. on the wall. It's like,</v>

132
00:07:52.931 --> 00:07:53.620
that is gone.

133
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.890
It's gone going in the place in places you didn't think would end on.

134
00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.900
It's the opposite, man. Why would I use it day when I can't reach my kids?

135
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.700
Like my are like the cleanest. You know? They, they are,

136
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.650
there's no such thing as a clean. Have you never had like the perfect?

137
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:16.690
You know, like the no wipes. Yeah. Like, like this is perfect. The perfect,

138
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.580
which was just like, you just shoot out a log and it's like one solid clean log.

139
00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.100
And then you look at it and it's like, no wipe, you look at it.

140
00:08:24.101 --> 00:08:27.760
And you're just like, man, I that's a piece of art right there in my family.

141
00:08:27.761 --> 00:08:30.070
We call that the swish because it doesn't touch the sides.

142
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:33.933
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

143
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.760
<v 0>Yeah. I just did a Swisher over there, man.</v>

144
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:40.090
You don't need a day after you did that swish, man. I mean,

145
00:08:40.091 --> 00:08:43.030
I still like it though. I still do it anyway because it feels good to me.

146
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.600
<v 1>The equivalent right. Of coming to Japan and just being like, yeah man,</v>

147
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.240
I just ate only KFC and burger King. It's like,

148
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:53.350
you've wasted the true potential of Japan. Like what have you done? Like you,

149
00:08:53.351 --> 00:08:57.000
you, it, it is, it is on Paul, honestly with food, something about Japan,

150
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.550
like food's amazing. And the experience is also goblin.

151
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:04.680
I actually look forward to taking a call white, to crack open the per day.

152
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:11.110
<v 0>Crack, crack, open a the day with the boys soccer from the blue day.</v>

153
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.250
<v 1>Just have a great time.</v>

154
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.620
<v 0>Yeah. for pleasure. Honestly.</v>

155
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.400
<v 1>I used to ship because there's a bodily function.</v>

156
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:23.600
Now I look forward to my cause it's Chapin and they've they figured out how to

157
00:09:23.601 --> 00:09:24.820
make and enjoyable.

158
00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:29.030
<v 0>I look forward to shooting for like other reasons. Like the day is just like</v>

159
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:30.950
[inaudible]. Yeah. W well, one I have Walmart

160
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:30.950
 and there's like two sacred places for me. And one is the shower. And the other one is when I'm taking 

161
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:30.950
a right now, probably probably like my channel wouldn't it

162
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:30.950
 wouldn't exist. If I couldn't share a shower

163
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:30.950
, where the am I going to get my ideas for it? You're having a

164
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:30.950
 existential crisis on the toilet. Yes I am. Who doesn't do you not know

165
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:30.950
? Because taking your for me is enjoyable. I have a great

166
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:30.950
 that's the reason like people think that I take such a long time to because I'm having like a mental breakdown 

167
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:30.950
time. No, I'm just having a great time. I'm just like, why would I leave early

168
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:30.950
 when I'm having this much fun right here. It's so fun. I love, but days are just, I 

169
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:30.950
don't know. In, in Thailand we have like an even worse

170
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:30.950
 thing, which is like, it's, it's, it's like, it's like a self pay

171
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:30.950
 day, right? So in like most Southeast Asian countries, we don't have like the auto on your 

172
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:30.950
per

173
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:30.950
 days. We have like a little like a shower head, like a mini shower head that you have to like put between your legs. Some European countries have that 

174
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:31.783
suit. Right?

175
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:27.770
<v 1>The whole bowl. The thing that like the little bowl next to it,</v>

176
00:10:27.771 --> 00:10:28.850
or you do it in the toilets.

177
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:33.920
<v 0>It's like the little bolting ball in the toilet. And at that point, like,</v>

178
00:10:33.921 --> 00:10:36.350
I dunno, I've always hated that feeling. Cause then you just get wet bulls.

179
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:40.400
<v 1>That's too much because the day is precise with where it's at. Right.</v>

180
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:42.310
And when you've used your own, V-Day long enough.

181
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.900
<v 0>But the days like sniping your eyes, you know,</v>

182
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:46.430
when you know where it's going to go. Yeah.

183
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.850
<v 1>The radius of which it'll spread. So you've got it down to not right.</v>

184
00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.170
<v 0>Like we talked about,</v>

185
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.750
how long have you been talking about showering are.

186
00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.980
<v 1>I've always wanted to talk about on the podcast because it's one of the no joke,</v>

187
00:11:00.981 --> 00:11:03.350
the most enjoyable parts of Japan. I know what to call it.

188
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:08.630
<v 0>So now the Japanese toilet experience, the Japanese experience.</v>

189
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.180
<v 1>I know where golden record experience comes from now.</v>

190
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.770
And it's it's when you're on the toilet.

191
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:17.930
<v 0>Did you get, like, what did, were you a bit like bored when you first saw how.</v>

192
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.570
<v 1>Operate the other day when you first came to Japan?</v>

193
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:23.360
I think a lot of British people are because it's like the thought of spraying

194
00:11:23.361 --> 00:11:25.070
your is so foreign to us. Yeah.

195
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:26.750
<v 0>What was the thing that you and Alan did again?</v>

196
00:11:26.751 --> 00:11:29.480
The first time you went to the hotel with him?

197
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:34.640
<v 1>How the day knew when you were sitting on it? The bathroom was like a wet room.</v>

198
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.250
So we were like, okay, well, does it matter if it's per day sprays everywhere?

199
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.260
And so we were, we had like a few drinks. We were like,

200
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:42.440
let's figure out how the day works. So we figured out the day won't spray,

201
00:11:42.441 --> 00:11:45.470
unless there's pressure on the seat is pretty cool. Yeah.

202
00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:47.660
And then it was like spraying on the wall. Cause no one was sitting there.

203
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.860
<v 0>Oh, this thing was going, Oh, it was spraying. Oh yeah. That's the pressure.</v>

204
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.313
<v 1>That's the pressure.</v>

205
00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:01.350
<v 0>The story of [inaudible] house in Australia, we always had a bad day.</v>

206
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.600
Cause my mom was like, I can't live without a bad day. So sorry.

207
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:06.780
<v 1>Because she's Japanese and she's like a King. She's like a peasant.</v>

208
00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.100
<v 0>Let me teach you Australians. How to like a King. So we had it in our,</v>

209
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:15.300
in our house. But of course when I was little, I didn't use the bad day. Right.

210
00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:17.760
Because I didn't know what the I was. I was just like, Oh, buttons.

211
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.380
But I didn't, I didn't press any of them.

212
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.920
I remember first time seeing him for a day and I'm just like, yo, do I need,

213
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:27.540
do I need a license to operate this? He's like,

214
00:12:27.541 --> 00:12:29.190
I feel like if I, if I personally want a button,

215
00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.550
like this toilet is gonna take off, like here,

216
00:12:31.551 --> 00:12:35.190
here is like the operating system of the day that you can see on screen right

217
00:12:35.191 --> 00:12:37.530
now. Especially like going to Japan the first time.

218
00:12:37.531 --> 00:12:40.260
And it's the wind in the day when I was little, like,

219
00:12:40.261 --> 00:12:42.210
I never knew how to use the day. Right. Cause I didn't,

220
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.320
I was just learned to like,

221
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.750
just make sure to wipe and wash your hands and then you'll be good.

222
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.170
But you know, when you get to like around like age six or seven,

223
00:12:49.171 --> 00:12:51.750
you start to get a little bit curious what these buttons I'll use this. Like,

224
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:56.440
I wonder what this is. So I did the fatal mistake though. So I pushed the,

225
00:12:56.441 --> 00:12:57.960
the day I started the day by,

226
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.800
but I made the fatal mistake getting up off of my seat and looking down at the

227
00:13:01.801 --> 00:13:05.490
toilet bowl spray. So sprayed me in the eye.

228
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.990
And this is water going everywhere. And I'm like, I don't know how to stop this,

229
00:13:09.991 --> 00:13:12.540
what the happening. I actually thought I broke my toilet.

230
00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:15.340
So I called my mom and I was just like, mom, come here.

231
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.930
So she came in Budae water going everywhere in this toilet.

232
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.320
And then the last thing she said, like, she finally stopped it. And she's like,

233
00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.230
you could have at least like flushed your, man.

234
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.660
<v 1>So the day water is also warm. So it is literally like a warm shower.</v>

235
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.520
Only double use only. And your thing is right, is that, you know,

236
00:13:38.521 --> 00:13:41.190
if you're an American or your just a westerner in general and you come and you

237
00:13:41.191 --> 00:13:43.590
see this toilet. Yeah. It can be daunting. Right. Because you know,

238
00:13:43.591 --> 00:13:46.890
normally things don't go near your. You're not used to that. Just embrace it.

239
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.890
It feels good. You know, it's scary. But once you,

240
00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:53.280
once you admit the things feel good when they spray your,

241
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.460
like discovering.

242
00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:58.380
<v 0>A new fetish, it's like, just give it.</v>

243
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.960
<v 1>A go. It's like, does it feel a little erotic?</v>

244
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:06.270
<v 0>Yeah, it does. But you know, if it feels good,</v>

245
00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.910
the wet afterwards just doesn't feel good.

246
00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:11.650
<v 1>It.</v>

247
00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:14.130
<v 0>Doesn't feel clean. I dunno, my doesn't feel properly.</v>

248
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.600
<v 1>Like I don't feel properly clean after a wipe.</v>

249
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.030
I feel like 90% clean after a while. Cause you know,

250
00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.520
there's always gonna be a little bit left. Right. Right. You know,

251
00:14:23.521 --> 00:14:24.780
that day is scraping that.

252
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.200
<v 0>Washing your hands without soap. It's like, you might feel clean,</v>

253
00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:30.750
but you don't really, until you use that soap,

254
00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:35.850
I know I need to physically feel my being clean and not like getting it washed.

255
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.680
I don't know. I need to feel that, man. I need to confirm with my own hands.

256
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.473
That's what you should do.

257
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.770
You should use the per day and then wipe it with your hand and see if it's still

258
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.610
good. Because like, it doesn't feel properly cleaned to me unless I shower.

259
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.780
Like my also never feels clean and that's my shower. And I probably soap in it.

260
00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.870
This man is like wasting buckets of water to clean his office.

261
00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.310
I only could just be using a bad day.
