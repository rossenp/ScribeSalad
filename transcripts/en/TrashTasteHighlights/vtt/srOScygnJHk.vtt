00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.010
<v 0>How do you guys feel about seasonal products here in Japan? Because you know,</v>

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.150
every country in the world has like seasonal products and stuff,

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.500
but I feel here it's just not as heavily advertised,

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.220
like Japan, take it to the next level. Whereas half the shelf,

5
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.090
sometimes I feel it's like seasonal products. Every, everything is seasonal.

6
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:22.950
Everything is freemium as well.

7
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.840
<v 1>I get it. Now I met, I remember they would talk about it in the enemies.</v>

8
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.520
They were like the enemies.

9
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.790
You don't know the pain until your favorite item has been removed from the

10
00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:34.520
Colombini. And I feel that because of that as well.

11
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.100
So many items that I just liked, uh, for some reason, the,

12
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.910
the wa the items that I specifically like would just randomly get removed from

13
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:44.270
the, yeah. I feel like I'll be like, Oh, it'll be back next week.

14
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.440
<v 0>I'm not going to lie.</v>

15
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.710
Every time I walk into a Colombini and I see something is like new,

16
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.260
I'm just like, Oh, I grab one of those. I don't know. Cause like.

17
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.510
<v 1>I don't want to try it. I want to get attached.</v>

18
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.910
<v 0>Yeah. That's exactly. That's exactly how I feel now.</v>

19
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.510
I feel like so many times living in Japan, I go to the company,

20
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.010
I try all this new, like, Oh,

21
00:01:04.011 --> 00:01:06.620
this like new product that's only available for spring.

22
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.650
Cause it's like the spring special winter special products. Try it.

23
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.810
Absolutely love it. And then a few months later, I'm like, man,

24
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.320
I want it. Now you've given me a craving and you've removed the craving.

25
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.950
And now I'm going to have to wait all year for it to maybe come back for it to

26
00:01:21.951 --> 00:01:23.570
maybe come back. Cause it might not even come back.

27
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.120
I hate that when they like bring out like a new, strong zero flavor.

28
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.540
And I'm just like, man, this is way better than the standard flavors too bad.

29
00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:33.230
It's only around for two weeks and I'll never see it again once it's gone,

30
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.560
because it's not just like items. Sometimes there's like menu items on, on,

31
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.890
in like restaurants as well that are only available during certain seasons.

32
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.880
I mean, I feel the biggest problem with that is that the one thing in Japanese,

33
00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:47.090
like especially supermarkets and restaurants that they love to do that whole

34
00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:49.550
like seasonal premium is with fruits.

35
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.310
<v 1>Oh God, we've gone out. We've ranted about food.</v>

36
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.900
<v 0>But like, I remember like I went to, uh, I don't remember. It was no,</v>

37
00:01:56.901 --> 00:01:57.734
it was a real host.

38
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.610
I went to Royal host and they were doing this like seasonal thing with grapes,

39
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.430
right? Like the green grapes, like the muskets.

40
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.850
And I tried a few of them because I like green grapes. And I was like, Oh,

41
00:02:07.851 --> 00:02:11.300
this is really nice. Went back the next week. And it was gone. I'm like, hell,

42
00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:13.340
this is really premium. Isn't it it's like, it was,

43
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.940
I swear it was only on the menu for like three days. And it's just gone. Yes.

44
00:02:16.941 --> 00:02:17.774
Where they,

45
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.710
they take like limited time sales to like another level here because it feels

46
00:02:21.711 --> 00:02:24.590
like a lot of things are just very limited.

47
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.190
It's a limited edition something it's limited edition products. Even, you know,

48
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.310
one can argue that that's like very good marketing. It is very good.

49
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.380
My people will look at something premium being like, well,

50
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:35.570
I guess if I can only get it now I should get it. Now.

51
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.901
<v 1>It is,</v>

52
00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:39.350
it is kind of cool going into a place and just having stuff be new constantly.

53
00:02:39.351 --> 00:02:40.790
But then there is also that fact of like, yeah,

54
00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:42.920
I did really like this one thing and you took it away from me.

55
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.600
So I'm very upset.

56
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.840
<v 0>Like the same thing, whenever you travel to a new like prefecture or something,</v>

57
00:02:47.841 --> 00:02:51.110
and there's every pre like we talked about before every prefecture has a

58
00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:53.630
specialty and an item, you can only get in that prefecture.

59
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.800
Every prefecture will tell you that this is the best rice in Japan.

60
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.510
Every prefecture will you, it's all. So it's like definitely living in Japan.

61
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:05.800
I've tried more like I've gone out of my comfort zone with trying new products

62
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:08.740
and new suites and everything. But at the same time,

63
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:13.510
I've just found more cravings that I can't get on a normal basis anymore because

64
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:15.400
it's only available in form of certain prefect.

65
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:20.230
What was the maple cakes that we bought from the Manju that we bought from

66
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:23.200
like Hiroshima? Oh, you, it was so good.

67
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.870
But the problem is you can only buy IMF, hung in Hiroshima.

68
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:26.830
So it's just like cool.

69
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.230
<v 1>Sweet person. But then I like, yeah, we bought those at one. And I was like,</v>

70
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.060
I want to eat all of them.

71
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.500
<v 0>And I stopped that. I thought the tiny, we bought a tiny bag</v>

72
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.390
could have gotten the pack of 24 weeks. Then I got the pack of Asia.

73
00:03:42.391 --> 00:03:45.090
You never know. Sometimes you go, you go, you try out this new thing. You like,

74
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.250
it's, it's all right. It's, it's made it's whatever. Right.

75
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.060
But sometimes you find that really amazing product and you're like, but then,

76
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.080
but then on the country,

77
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.410
isn't it amazing when you find that one regional thing that you think you're

78
00:03:55.411 --> 00:03:58.560
never going to see in Tokyo and then just one random shop sells it.

79
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.300
it. Like I remember like, uh, in Tuskegee, for example,

80
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.260
they have this thing called lemon milk. Yeah. Which I love. And it's like, uh,

81
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.770
it was a regional specific thing for the longest time. And I was like, well,

82
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.470
I gotta make a trip up to, to get every time I want this.

83
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.620
So I would always buy it in bulk when I would come back home naturally.

84
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.390
But of course it doesn't last. Right.

85
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.160
And then the craving comes back and I get regression. But then I remember,

86
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.490
uh,

87
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.180
I walked into like a random Colombini once and they were just selling it and it

88
00:04:27.181 --> 00:04:30.720
was like, it was like Eldorado. You know, it was just like,

89
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.590
[inaudible] bought all that and, and brought her back. I was like, all right,

90
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.930
put it on Google maps. This is the company that sells the, the lemon milk man.

91
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.880
<v 1>The, the Sapporo special, um, thing. You'd be a, what is it?</v>

92
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.510
What's it called again? Sapporo beer. No, no, no. It's uh,

93
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.870
what's the prefecture called Ocado. Yeah. Yeah. We forgot for a second.

94
00:04:54.871 --> 00:04:58.650
Then Hokkaido, the support will be, it is way better when they have like the,

95
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.760
the Sapporo. So actual support will be, uh, yeah, so, so good.

96
00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:04.980
I wanted to bring so much back, but it's heavy.

97
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.510
<v 0>This doesn't actually make a difference though.</v>

98
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.340
I genuinely think it tastes better. Yeah.

99
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.470
I think Sapporo in Japan tastes worse than I

100
00:05:13.471 --> 00:05:15.640
remember it tasting abroad. I dunno. It's,

101
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:17.820
it's weird if maybe it's cause I have it way more often now,

102
00:05:17.821 --> 00:05:21.660
but when I have support, like on tap somewhere else, I was like, Oh,

103
00:05:21.661 --> 00:05:25.650
this is so much better than the beer that we, that the other day that we had.

104
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.600
But I think it's because you're comparing it to other bees, right?

105
00:05:27.601 --> 00:05:31.620
Like I remember a Saki tasting infinitely better in Australia taste.

106
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.980
But now I'm more scared to go back to Australia and have the beer in Australia.

107
00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:42.420
I'm like, if I think a soggy is mid now, which used to be like gone to before,

108
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.370
I don't want to drink a VB. Right.

109
00:05:44.371 --> 00:05:45.930
Like I feel like I'm going to throw up drinking that.

110
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.320
I can't imagine going back and going like drinking a calling again.

111
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.733
Carling is like.

112
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.410
<v 1>Water in the UK. It's one of the worst beers.</v>

113
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.090
And there'll be sports bars in Japan that alike. We're partnered with.

114
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.200
<v 0>Michelle calling in Carlsbad. I've seen that before. Uh,</v>

115
00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.300
odd wiser Budweiser. Yeah.

116
00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.030
Cause I've seen like a special or special restaurants.

117
00:06:10.031 --> 00:06:14.650
They sell like this tie-back singer beer. And it's like in, in Thailand,

118
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.050
it's like the dirtiest cheapest beer you can get,

119
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.030
like they don't even put it on tap. They put it in.

120
00:06:19.031 --> 00:06:20.350
Like they put it in like a cat

121
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.000
[inaudible] in Japan. They're on a menu, like 500,

122
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.400
500 yen for little can of Singapore. You're wrestling.

123
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.640
Tyler who is going to go to Japan and be like, Oh,

124
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:38.530
we have exclusive Heineken in bottle 700 yen, please. It's like,

125
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.430
no, yo Heineken and Amsterdam is great.

126
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.140
And Amsterdam is good beer at wherever it's proved is the best. Like, you know,

127
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.600
uh, uh, Oh my God. I'm blanking here. The Irish one. Yeah.

128
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.400
Skin to skin in Ireland. Ireland is like, get us on and just hit different.

129
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.290
Yeah. But then I had a Guinness here on top because they were having it on tap.

130
00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:04.000
So I'm like, I was curious. I was like, all right, well,

131
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.960
get us in Ireland is so good. I do that every time as well. I was like, Oh,

132
00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:10.420
they have Guinness on tap here in Japan. Let me see you do it.

133
00:07:10.421 --> 00:07:13.720
Just to get hurt because you hold out the hope, right?

134
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.780
You hold out the hope of me. Maybe this is the one,

135
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.190
maybe this is the place it's like, this pub might be the SSR pool.

136
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.610
It's like, miss might be the one. I mean, this is the one.

137
00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.920
And every time I get disappointed, it's like.

138
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.150
<v 1>No, never going to be the one. I was like, every time I see like Irish.</v>

139
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:35.680
<v 0>Pub in Tokyo, I was like, yeah, the one is that the one place that I can go is,</v>

140
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.540
cause it's not even Turkey. It's worldwide for me.

141
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.660
Like every time I see a Guinness on tap, cause that's me on tap. Never, never,

142
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.320
that can't. But like it has to be on tap. Cause I'm like, it's on tap. Maybe,

143
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.450
maybe, maybe this is the one. Maybe, maybe they figured out the secret. And uh,

144
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.260
I remember waiting if,

145
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:53.710
if anyone in the world has ever tasted the Guinness outside of Ireland,

146
00:07:53.711 --> 00:07:57.520
that tastes as good as in Ireland. Delusional, please, please hit me.

147
00:07:57.521 --> 00:08:00.610
I need to know when we literally traveled to that place.

148
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:04.570
Why not just travel to islands gone? I'll just go to Ireland at that point.

149
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:09.100
I'm curious. I'm curious to see if there's any place outside of travel. Well,

150
00:08:09.101 --> 00:08:09.250
you.

151
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.750
<v 1>Know, this is the sad truth of it gone.</v>

152
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:15.100
<v 0>As well. Like that should does not travel. I'm okay. I'm okay with that.</v>

153
00:08:15.101 --> 00:08:16.030
Staying in Australia,

154
00:08:16.031 --> 00:08:19.640
actually I had a kangaroo steak here in Japan at an Outback steakhouse of all

155
00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.290
five places just cause I was curious and I was like, man, this does not travel.

156
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.150
I found that out on that day that.

157
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.770
<v 1>He does not travel. You know, it's also bizarre. Uh, when I was in, uh,</v>

158
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.860
Hokkaido, I was at a train station and there's like 11:00 AM.

159
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.710
There's so many people drinking beer in the station. Yeah.

160
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.270
Like just like everyone showing every kind of like,

161
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.980
you know a group you can imagine like young girls, old men, young men,

162
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.070
they were all just chilling in the station, just drinking a Sapporo beer. Yeah.

163
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.900
<v 0>And I'm like, I'm like, this is weird.</v>

164
00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:55.770
<v 1>It was just drinking beer at like 11:00 AM. What the? It's in the station.</v>

165
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.290
They're like public waiting area.

166
00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.770
<v 0>It's like that in Okinawa as well. But instead of beer, it's our money,</v>

167
00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.800
which is essentially just really strong.

168
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.140
It's basically AKI now in vodka.

169
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.440
That's the only way to describe it because I forget sometimes about the public

170
00:09:09.441 --> 00:09:13.010
drinking laws, which you can drink publicly, publicly here.

171
00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:17.510
Because I feel like I didn't expect to see so many people were drinking in the

172
00:09:17.511 --> 00:09:19.340
daytime in Japan. Like I,

173
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.700
I get surprised when I see an eye open because I'm like,

174
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.700
who the is going through? And he's like, yeah, like 12:00 AM. You'll see them.

175
00:09:25.701 --> 00:09:28.280
And they'll be drinking a beverage. Yeah. I never,

176
00:09:28.281 --> 00:09:32.480
I never thought that the concept of like lunchtime beer was a thing here until I

177
00:09:32.481 --> 00:09:35.240
saw it for myself. I was like, wow, they're actually having one.

178
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.820
It's like it's for people. You don't explain it.

179
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.610
Cause it's always like the old people, tired people were just like, Hey,

180
00:09:40.611 --> 00:09:42.440
let's just have a lunchtime crack, open a beer.

181
00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.070
<v 1>UK. It's all the old people too as well.</v>

182
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.620
If you have a good of Wetherspoons at like mid day,

183
00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:53.090
you'll always see the same old people Downing pints at like 12. And you're like,

184
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.590
it's okay. I'll be asleep by four anyways. Yeah.
