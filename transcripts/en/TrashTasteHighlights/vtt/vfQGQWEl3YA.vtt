00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.160
<v 0>Like I, I swear in Japan, like just normal marketing things.</v>

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.730
They just don't care about that. Like advertisements everywhere.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.370
Don't care about that. Oh, Oh,

4
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.830
there's a collaboration where I can get my favorite character poorly printed on

5
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:13.560
a latte. Oh, well, a hundred bucks. Hello.

6
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.200
<v 1>Insane. When you see it on paper, it just sounds like a great pretender episode.</v>

7
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.610
It's just like pull this off. This is like high five though.

8
00:00:22.611 --> 00:00:26.450
This is like the ova episode, man. When they sell Christmas to the Japanese.

9
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.820
<v 0>It's. It's like some ocean's 11 sheet with every marketing department. And like,</v>

10
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.950
they, they, they do collaborations with stuff.

11
00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:36.740
So this is a really common thing in Japan where they don't just market things

12
00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:39.980
normally catch up adverts. It's like, you have to collaborate with businesses.

13
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.980
Like I went to the supermarket and I saw like washing detergent.

14
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.800
It was like a bongo, stray dogs, collaboration. Oh yeah.

15
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.250
We got one with Levi on it. Yeah. And I was like, okay, Levi, that makes sense.

16
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.350
But like some shows it's like, why,

17
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.080
why does Bango stray dogs have a collaboration with washing detergent?

18
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.340
<v 1>It w it works. I'm a weep. It works. I see. I see.</v>

19
00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:02.540
Like I see Evangelu I see Oscar's face plus plus it on some coffee. I'm like.

20
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.990
<v 0>No, no, no, no. This is why I hate it because to me, right.</v>

21
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.380
You don't go to a fine dining restaurant, for example. Right.

22
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.340
I draw a smiley face on your hamburger. You'd be insulted.

23
00:01:13.341 --> 00:01:15.530
Wouldn't you you'd be like, no, no, no, no. Where's my steak.

24
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.740
Why is there a smiley on it? This is the way I see stuff. And like,

25
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.060
if you put like characters on it or you put like, it's smiley faces, I hate it.

26
00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:25.970
When Disney does that, by the way, when they put smiley faces on your food,

27
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.300
it's like, what is, what is my food? A joke to you? I want to eat it. Nevermind.

28
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.250
I'm going to go him. But like, to me,

29
00:01:31.251 --> 00:01:34.550
you're making the product seem more childish by putting stuff on it.

30
00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:37.880
So when I see these collaborations, like most of the time with like,

31
00:01:37.881 --> 00:01:40.880
especially with the animals at the cafes, I'm like, this is all disgusting.

32
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.820
You're selling me a $3 latte for 10 times the price.

33
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.390
<v 1>I mean, I feel like I'm offended. I mean, I feel like it's just, it's,</v>

34
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.450
it's very similar to what they do in the West with celebrities. But like.

35
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.540
<v 0>You know, you don't get like a Kim Kardashian latte.</v>

36
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.790
<v 1>Um, didn't Travis, Scott just do like a</v>

37
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.370
Donald's wasn't that insanely like successful as well.

38
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.250
<v 0>Hey, first of all, I've miss certain correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

39
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.050
they didn't plaster his face on it.

40
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.690
<v 1>I'm pretty sure they had like a specific menu. That was the.</v>

41
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.970
<v 0>Travis Travis Scott meal piece on it. Like I ordered a,</v>

42
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.000
I went to the promise Netherland, uh, collaboration thing,

43
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.780
and there was a cafe and you could get one of the characters of the promise,

44
00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:25.130
Neverland printed on your latter. And I thought, okay, fine. It's $10,

45
00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:28.100
by the way, you want to add that? Which is ridiculous for a second.

46
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.630
<v 1>With stuff like that, you have to understand that the fans will pay anything.</v>

47
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.920
<v 0>The amount of money for that one photo. Right? Right. So then I, you know, I go,</v>

48
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.400
I go to habit and I got to drink it. And then as I drink this latte,

49
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.880
like this film of like the plastic, they printed.

50
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.320
<v 1>It goes in my mouth and I'm.</v>

51
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.740
<v 0>Like, God, it's disgusting as viral.</v>

52
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.250
And I don't wanna have to peel off my coffee to eat it. So I'm here, I'm here,

53
00:02:52.251 --> 00:02:53.870
scooping it out, ruining this picture.

54
00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:56.300
They printed on it and I've sent ended the hating, all of it.

55
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.040
I don't care how much your fan I am of something.

56
00:02:58.041 --> 00:03:00.040
I don't want that printed my food. I mean, that's.

57
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.150
<v 1>Kind of on you then for going into that cafe, right?</v>

58
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.570
Like you could have easily just gone to a Starbucks, right?

59
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.590
<v 0>If you go to the exhibition or whatever you go to these things,</v>

60
00:03:07.591 --> 00:03:10.530
I don't mean not that like, there's like enough that if you're a fan, right.

61
00:03:10.531 --> 00:03:12.810
But then like you have to, you have to oblique Terry to go to the gift,

62
00:03:12.811 --> 00:03:16.710
shop on the cafe because you know yeah. Of course you have to. And you know,

63
00:03:16.711 --> 00:03:18.330
the gift shop sometimes has some good stuff,

64
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.680
but some stuff that I don't care about,

65
00:03:19.681 --> 00:03:23.640
like they're obsessed with making coasters of characters. [inaudible].

66
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.790
<v 1>The coast is I've noticed that as well, because it's, they're putting,</v>

67
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.910
got you into it blind box.

68
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.910
So if you want to collect the character, she like, you got it.

69
00:03:32.911 --> 00:03:34.170
You got to buy more. Right.

70
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.590
You got to buy an extra meal because that was exactly the same thing as when I

71
00:03:37.591 --> 00:03:38.880
went to the fate museum as well.

72
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.940
<v 0>It's like being a kid all over again with the happy meal toys. Yeah, man.</v>

73
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.390
I remember one time. I like, I really there burger King,

74
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.870
we're doing this collaboration with like SpongeBob toys. And I was like, mum,

75
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.160
listen, this is the third I need to go destroy Patrick star. I've had mum,

76
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.520
can you please go and do like a Karen thing and get me the other toy?

77
00:03:59.521 --> 00:04:01.260
And she was like, my parents used to do that all the time.

78
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.380
She would always go up and ask. But sometimes they'd be like, no, really?

79
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.340
<v 1>Yeah. I've never heard of someone saying no. Yeah. Yeah. They usually just like,</v>

80
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.860
whatever. I don't get paid enough to find it. Yeah, exactly. Right.

81
00:04:10.861 --> 00:04:13.500
And it's like out of control, we got dogs would see on a kid.

82
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:14.850
I get paid six holes in it.

83
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.830
<v 0>Oh, I'm just giving it to you. But yeah, I just,</v>

84
00:04:16.831 --> 00:04:18.690
I'm not a big fan of the collaboration cafes.

85
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.630
I just feel like you don't really get that good of an experience of the show.

86
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.190
<v 1>I feel like a collaboration cafes are a bit. A bit Taki,</v>

87
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.350
Taki, Taki.

88
00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:32.640
Like I feel like most animate cafes are like that. I've never been,

89
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.820
I've never been to like an anime cafe and been impressed by it.

90
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.650
<v 0>Because it's like, you go into this room, that's like a normal sized cafe.</v>

91
00:04:40.651 --> 00:04:41.610
And you're like, Oh,

92
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.850
they've just plastered paintings of the characters in the shows on the wall.

93
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.000
<v 1>Yeah. It's like, they don't even get creative with it.</v>

94
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.670
Like I would say I've been to quite a few because AKI likes to do videos on

95
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.350
there, but I'd say the only,

96
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.050
I've only ever been to two collaborative cafes where I was just like,

97
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.960
I would go back and that's the Pokemon cafe and the Kirby cafe.

98
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.000
But that's just because Nintendo has just so much bigger of a budget that they

99
00:05:03.001 --> 00:05:05.510
can afford to get a little more creative with it. Right? Yeah.

100
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:06.511
<v 0>So many of them,</v>

101
00:05:06.511 --> 00:05:09.690
you go and watch a YouTube video of someone like go into a cafe and it's like,

102
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:10.381
you could see,

103
00:05:10.381 --> 00:05:13.350
these are the cheapest desperately trying to get like seven minutes out of this

104
00:05:13.351 --> 00:05:15.000
cafe at the end of the day. It's just like,

105
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.310
it's literally just paintings on a wall.

106
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.910
<v 1>Yeah. I went to the, whether I'm with you cafe and that was so close.</v>

107
00:05:20.911 --> 00:05:25.050
It's the same formula every time. Like if you come to Japan,

108
00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:28.260
come to like one anime cafe and then realize that that's,

109
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.570
that's the experience with every cafe, you know, you,

110
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.700
the way I see it is that you come once as a tourist and you're like, Oh,

111
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:34.410
it was cool.

112
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.160
And then you just don't go to any others because they're all the same. No, no.

113
00:05:38.161 --> 00:05:40.950
I was gonna say like also how they get you with all these like animate cafes is

114
00:05:40.951 --> 00:05:43.770
that they they're only open for limited amounts of time. Right.

115
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.760
So there's a sense of make money. There's a sense of urgency where it's like,

116
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.060
Oh, the promise, Netherland and cafes only open for two weeks. Yeah. I mean,

117
00:05:51.061 --> 00:05:55.140
I would promise Neverland and then you go and you get disappointed.

118
00:05:55.141 --> 00:05:58.940
And before you can file a complaint, it's it's viral as well.

119
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.680
It's all microwave food or whatever. The Kirby cafe though,

120
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.960
had some really good food. I was like, I was like, I was actually like, wow,

121
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.310
okay.

122
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.280
<v 0>No, I want to have someone be like, you must try this souffle. You must,</v>

123
00:06:09.281 --> 00:06:12.670
you must go to the square in the collaboration cafe for the best.

124
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.870
<v 1>Cause it's not like going to the Jojo bar where there was obviously like a fan</v>

125
00:06:16.871 --> 00:06:21.460
of Jojo personalize, these cocktails in the streets, a bunch of corporate,

126
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.000
it's all sponsored. It's all corporate businessmen stamping like Hmm. Yes.

127
00:06:25.001 --> 00:06:27.700
Collaboration. We do coasters.

128
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.680
Let's print the character on a latte and put some anime posters up and then sell

129
00:06:32.681 --> 00:06:33.700
a bunch of clear falls.

130
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:38.890
<v 0>What do you like breaking 70 dreams right now? Like swimming. How listen,</v>

131
00:06:38.891 --> 00:06:41.770
if you come here on a, on like a visiting, you'll probably find it interesting.

132
00:06:41.771 --> 00:06:43.330
If there's a show you really liked. But in general.

133
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.270
<v 1>[Inaudible] like the cafe is always the lowest point to any like big anime</v>

134
00:06:49.271 --> 00:06:51.250
event. Cause I went, I went to the fake cafe,

135
00:06:51.251 --> 00:06:54.820
but that was the fake cafe in the fates museum.

136
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.440
And the museum exhibition actually was awesome. Oh yeah.

137
00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.810
Cause you got to see the entire history of this franchise.

138
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.820
Like of not just fake,

139
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.960
but like the entire like type and moon universe and everything. Cool.

140
00:07:07.961 --> 00:07:10.720
If it's like a co like, cause I went to the corner super cafe,

141
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.050
but that was in par with the corners of a movie.

142
00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.590
So you can only go to this cafe if you bought tickets to the movie.

143
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.500
So that was like, okay, you know, it's like a little bonus thing,

144
00:07:20.501 --> 00:07:23.650
but I wouldn't go all the way to central Tokyo. It's got a corner soup.

145
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:25.530
It's just not worth it. Like I,

146
00:07:25.531 --> 00:07:27.850
I definitely wouldn't recommend going to any pop-up cafes.

147
00:07:27.851 --> 00:07:30.790
If something's limited time, then they have not put effort into no, no.

148
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:31.610
<v 0>The, the,</v>

149
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.030
the best our interior is actually like the one I made a video and we just let

150
00:07:34.031 --> 00:07:36.790
the 3d latte, all that cafe. So good.

151
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.090
<v 1>Just suck your Dick there. She's like mama say that you're in a good cafe.</v>

152
00:07:40.091 --> 00:07:43.720
I've been to is the one that I made. I wouldn't make.

153
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.790
