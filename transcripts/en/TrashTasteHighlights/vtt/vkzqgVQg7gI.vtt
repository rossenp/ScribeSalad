WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
<v 0>I guess I don't want to talk about the thing that all three of us would be</v>

2
00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:05.820
wanting to ask. Yeah. I mean,

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.300
as an animator on Twitter and everything like that, I didn't matter. Yeah.

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.810
You're European European. You, your opinion matters. All opinion doesn't mean,

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.230
your opinion. On the other hand, it means a lot. Yeah.

6
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.600
Like how would you feel about, you know,

7
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.340
artists and animators getting backlash after an episode has

8
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.100
aired, for example, attack on Titan. Yeah. I would say it,

9
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.410
people are very, very angry and have been sending even I think death threats

10
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.100
and animators on Twitter and stuff like that.

11
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.620
And it's just that scare you or anything like that? Working on projects.

12
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.560
<v 1>If I had those kind of treads, I will be, Oh, I messed up that.</v>

13
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.360
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

14
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.810
<v 1>In my case, my it's just Twitter internet.</v>

15
00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:54.350
I don't have time to bother about that. I have to consider it in my car.

16
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.750
<v 0>Yeah, exactly.</v>

17
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.213
<v 1>So, yeah,</v>

18
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.600
but the four people who gave it or the girl didn't sleep managed to,

19
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.060
to deliver the wizard and receive all the threats, it's a bit, it's a bit.

20
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.040
<v 0>It's pulled off to deal with threats at work.</v>

21
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.020
<v 1>Yeah. And I think most of you need me to is known. So walking up,</v>

22
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.100
I couldn't get a good well,

23
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.080
but I managed to [inaudible] and they know their level and they want

24
00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:30.590
to progress to good. Everybody wants to do a good episode,

25
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:33.200
want to make a quality better.

26
00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:37.940
You have to manage it with the amount of scheduled amount of money. Uh,

27
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.670
and it's, uh, yes, it's very hard.

28
00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:44.300
And sometimes you and I mentioned a good

29
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.170
schedule, a good there's something good going well, doesn't things.

30
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.310
If you have a lot of preventative programs you have to adjust to.

31
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.270
<v 0>It's not just like the problem of like, you know, the single animator, right.</v>

32
00:01:56.271 --> 00:01:58.790
It's like, there's a lot of things that the animator probably has to juggle,

33
00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:01.190
but like, yeah. Like, you know, both say for example,

34
00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:05.540
like I would maybe understand a little more if even the animator looked at what

35
00:02:05.541 --> 00:02:07.850
they did and was like, yeah, that wasn't my best work,

36
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.790
but this is a toggle of time with you. And it's been pretty amazing so far.

37
00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:15.500
Have you been following the episodes of watches? The last one?

38
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.000
For some reason, I'm very vocal. They're like, Oh, it's terrible.

39
00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:21.710
Now the animation quality is terrible.

40
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.390
<v 1>Most of the people don't like the CGI. Yeah. And yeah,</v>

41
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.230
if you are used to, um, something that you wish that you have done

42
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.680
[inaudible] yeah. And now it's a, we CJ actually me too, when I see, Oh,

43
00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:40.970
this isn't your job or I'm beat. I prefer it. It was our more on taco go.

44
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.380
I don't understand.

45
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.410
<v 0>Yeah. But, but you could say that because you'll eat.</v>

46
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.830
<v 1>So some of the immune says, Oh, she's used,</v>

47
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.570
I would prefer [inaudible]. But there is not a reason to, to.

48
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.390
<v 0>People like the shows ruined the seats.</v>

49
00:02:56.391 --> 00:02:59.590
The CGI has ruined my show and it's like, why, why does your brain?

50
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.933
It's so bizarre.

51
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.690
People are also complaining about some of the soccer guys as well. Really? Yeah.

52
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.500
I've been seeing that, like, you know, some, some, uh,

53
00:03:06.501 --> 00:03:09.010
I've seen some people on Twitter. It's been awesome.

54
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.690
Some people on Twitter have, you know,

55
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:13.420
like done comparisons with like the Munga panels, for example,

56
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.140
and being like completely ruined. It's not exactly the same. Right?

57
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:20.320
Like how do you feel about stuff like that? They pushed him.

58
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.360
Cause, cause I've always wanted, cause you've worked on some pretty high praise.

59
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.270
Do you ever have this problem as well? Do you ever, like when working on it,

60
00:03:30.271 --> 00:03:34.440
do you ever like feel the pressure whenever you're working on a big IP need to

61
00:03:34.441 --> 00:03:35.310
and want to deliver?

62
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.540
<v 1>Very, um, I know that most of the,</v>

63
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.810
when I post something of my Ganga, uh,

64
00:03:42.811 --> 00:03:47.340
in Twitter is not my animation. They have likes it's more, the,

65
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.260
the IP has likes, right. People don't, I don't know.

66
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.480
Most of the people like puts it like, or the retreat. Oh. But because it's my,

67
00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.380
I like this IP.

68
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.990
<v 0>Yeah. No, because like Joe, Joe, Joe fans. Right.</v>

69
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:03.643
I did see on your screen.

70
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.460
<v 1>Sure. Yeah. I think it was my Georgia had the most, uh,</v>

71
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.953
retreats.

72
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.150
<v 0>Uh, she, uh, uh, I think I saw the animation that you did for that. Uh</v>

73
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.180
[inaudible] that's like literally like the best fight in port for like so good.

74
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.850
And it was amazing. Oh man, it was so hard to this day.

75
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.300
<v 1>Yeah. It was in 2018. Yeah. It was Christmas.</v>

76
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.100
And I spend, or my Christmas and new year at working at this table.

77
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.110
I spent three weeks at sleeping,

78
00:04:37.111 --> 00:04:41.790
under study to finish sleeping at the studio for the fight

79
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.830
because I had to finish the heroic layout. And after he broke, I had a mayor.

80
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.910
<v 0>The, a layout while you're working on the Jojo game though.</v>

81
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.320
<v 1>I finished her here.</v>

82
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.790
I came back and uh,

83
00:04:56.791 --> 00:05:00.990
and the deadline was like the 10th. So January.

84
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.240
And so most of my coworkers are went to what was a typical.

85
00:05:06.241 --> 00:05:10.410
So most of it was in France, French people. So they went back to France.

86
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.820
I spend the new year and I came back and this is when they

87
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.050
went to France. It was, I had no beer. And when they came back, I had to be.

88
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:26.303
<v 0>[Inaudible] became a home.</v>

89
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.220
<v 1>And uh, so I was going to, uh, uh,</v>

90
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.270
go gym to have my shower.

91
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.460
<v 0>So when you went, like the case where like, if you were that all the time,</v>

92
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.770
you're putting, like, were you just thinking about it in the shower as well?

93
00:05:43.771 --> 00:05:46.140
You're like thinking about what you were going to draw next as well.

94
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.850
<v 1>Yeah. Show it takes time, but sometimes you can quit.</v>

95
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.670
Each house may smell bad. I have to take a shower.

96
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.520
<v 0>So to optimize your showers, it's just like,</v>

97
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.680
do you ever get to the point when you're just like eating too much time?

98
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.590
<v 1>I was eating, watching an episode eating and okay.</v>

99
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.710
Zippy's had finished AFF it finished to eat. Okay. To go back to work.

100
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.470
<v 0>You're welcome, Joseph. Yeah.</v>

101
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.590
<v 1>So yes. Yeah. And I get sick also.</v>

102
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.980
I think I know him.

103
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.870
He's a bad one or I have a inference of how do we say in influenza you

104
00:06:25.871 --> 00:06:26.704
get infringed.

105
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.963
<v 0>You got flu,</v>

106
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.540
literally killing yourself with Joe friends. Uh,

107
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.123
you can say you were.

108
00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.140
<v 1>I was trying to do my best on this one.</v>

109
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.250
<v 0>I think Olivia would argue that's one of the best fight scenes in part five.</v>

110
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.540
Yeah. Think it looks amazing as well. Yeah. I think we'll all have part five.

111
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.440
Everyone could tell I just saying that. Yeah, no, it's definitely crowdfund.

112
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.880
<v 1>Uh, animations is a teamwork. So like I said,</v>

113
00:06:57.881 --> 00:07:01.960
I do the rough animation with the jerks to put some correction.

114
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.710
So something that was a two liter, how can I say, Oh,

115
00:07:05.711 --> 00:07:09.460
you can push more this arm. The director will put it in. After the,

116
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.620
the director of animation, we put the Mo more in model.

117
00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.480
Right.

118
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:20.200
And so these three tips are very important after I hae received this correction.

119
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.080
I original it. Everything was all the detailed,

120
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:27.670
all the shadows or the light or the perfect frames. So yes,

121
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.530
it's a teamwork. And after these drawings,

122
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.830
it will be the in-betweener who will cleanup.

123
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.630
And it's a very, a team walkie. It's not just one.

124
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:40.300
Animator's walk. You have the director,

125
00:07:40.301 --> 00:07:42.790
the director of animations in between are the color.

126
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.840
<v 0>Um, um, I'm, I'm curious. It's gonna be a dumb question. Uh,</v>

127
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.320
do you like here when you're drawing it, I assume,

128
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.500
is the voice acting records at that point? Or is it not recorded? No, it's,

129
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.610
it's tough to, Oh, wow. It's acting as post-production. Yeah. Oh, wow.

130
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.790
So you don't even get to like, hear the lines as you're drawing or anything.

131
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:05.860
<v 1>Sometimes you have, uh, some, um, a rough voice. Right. But it's not, uh,</v>

132
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:06.850
the finer of it.

133
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.010
<v 0>That's right. Yeah. It's mostly, it's mostly just like,</v>

134
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.730
I think it's written out in the layout section right. Of what the actual,

135
00:08:12.731 --> 00:08:14.350
what they're going to say in this particular class.

136
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.720
<v 1>Every board at the storyboard. And after you have the time sheet,</v>

137
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.850
when at this moment you have to have it.

138
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.270
<v 0>Oh. And then the voice actors match that. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

139
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:27.100
So all animators dubbed anime. Yeah. Yeah. It is done. Yeah. Wow.

140
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:31.810
[inaudible].
