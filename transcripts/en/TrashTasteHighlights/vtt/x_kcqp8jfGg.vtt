WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.670
<v 0>I mean, have you seen the, the new, uh, theme park.</v>

2
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:03.613
<v 1>That released</v>

3
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.280
[inaudible] I saw a picture of that and I thought, wow,

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.580
Lego lands really improved. I didn't think it was real at first.

5
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.090
I usually hate amusement parks, but first time I'm like, yeah, I'm gone.

6
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.100
<v 0>You want to go now before it's opens up to tourists? Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.</v>

7
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.143
<v 1>Gotta be hell.</v>

8
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.090
But knowing Japan is going to be another lottery to get those tickets.

9
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.570
And I hate that. I talked about that. I don't think we've talked about that.

10
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.690
So I watched the video of, uh, uh, what's the guy's name.

11
00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:31.850
I should get him a motto, like having a tour of it.

12
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.670
<v 0>And you get like a, a bracelet you can like hit with.</v>

13
00:00:34.671 --> 00:00:38.630
And like there's like keys and stopped really? Do he looks bad. Like,

14
00:00:38.631 --> 00:00:41.000
I felt like a ten-year-old watching him talk about it.

15
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.770
<v 1>Sorry. I started Japanese YouTuber who got like first access ever as [inaudible]</v>

16
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.770
, but he's also been the Jack, but he's been sponsored by USDA

17
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.603
 and Nintendo in the past.

18
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.180
<v 0>She's literally like, Japan's like YouTube. Oh, he cooking. Yeah. Yeah.</v>

19
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.870
Because one time the like either policemen that was asked to be like,

20
00:00:59.871 --> 00:01:03.480
what do you do? And I was like, YouTube. It he's like, Oh, like he in like, no,

21
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.530
no, like he got canned. I'm like, yeah. He khaki man. Like, yeah, dude. Yeah.

22
00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:08.960
Whatever, like he could kill on YouTube.

23
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.000
<v 1>Yeah. Pretty much strange. But uh, yeah. What the we've never talked about.</v>

24
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.320
Right? So this is how you get tickets in Japan basically. Yeah.

25
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.590
<v 0>I explain that it's better than scalping. The scalpel, scalping, scalping,</v>

26
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.710
scalping, scalping is people who buy a ton of things.

27
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.550
<v 1>Oh, no people do that too. I mean,</v>

28
00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:33.260
it's just in theory to stop that from happening. Right. But like,

29
00:01:33.261 --> 00:01:36.530
for example, the, when the Olympics, uh,

30
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.530
we don't know if that's going to be happening next year, but uh.

31
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.260
<v 0>We announced that it will be. Yeah, we'll see.</v>

32
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.970
I reckon it will happen no matter what,

33
00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:45.350
but it'd be interesting to see how bell does it.

34
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.200
<v 1>Yeah, exactly. But like with the Olympics, for example, they did a,</v>

35
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.100
it's so dumb.

36
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.990
So they do a lottery that you enter and it's like a lottery to get a

37
00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:56.990
certain amount of tickets. So this is how we do it. So like, uh,

38
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.340
when I went to the persona five, uh, concert, yeah, it was a lottery system,

39
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.140
but it was really weird because it was like,

40
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.270
you go into the lottery to get a certain number of tickets and

41
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.180
they're different lottery. So it's like, if you want to go just by yourself,

42
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:13.070
you enter the lottery to get one ticket,

43
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.030
but there's another lottery to get two tickets or three tickets or four tickets.

44
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.700
And just because you enter into one of them,

45
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.970
it's not guaranteed that you're going to get those tickets. Yeah.

46
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.510
But then what it is is that you might think, Oh, okay.

47
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:29.600
So if you win the lottery, then you just get the tickets, right. No,

48
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.270
you get the right to purchase the tickets.

49
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.340
Japan have figured out a way to get your fight. Every process possible, man.

50
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.150
<v 0>Yeah. I mean, it's also, I also saw that you could get some of the tickets,</v>

51
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.910
but you could only be entered into some of them if you bought like a Panasonic

52
00:02:43.911 --> 00:02:45.220
device. Yeah.

53
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.540
They were like giving away some of the tickets to cause I was like, what the?

54
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.760
<v 1>And also, and also the thing, as well as that,</v>

55
00:02:49.761 --> 00:02:52.070
like say you into the lottery to get four tickets. Right.

56
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.510
But you're not sure if you're going to get it.

57
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.370
So you want to enter multiple times,

58
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.740
but here's the kicker for say you win twice. Right.

59
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:03.490
In that FortiGate lottery. You're forced to pay for those eight tickets.

60
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.700
You can't back out of that. Like you're actually forced.

61
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.850
Like even if it's only four people that you're going with just did another

62
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:13.210
lottery for backup. You have to buy eight tickets. It's just,

63
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:15.510
it just doesn't make sense to me. It just doesn't make sense. I,

64
00:03:15.511 --> 00:03:20.200
I understand in theory why they do it, but I feel like this is this.

65
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.170
This is like trying to put out a fire with cooking oil. You know what I mean?

66
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:26.350
It's just the most roundabout. Time-consuming way to do it.

67
00:03:26.351 --> 00:03:28.360
And I guaranteed Nintendo. Lion's going to do the same thing.

68
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.620
<v 0>Yeah. Probably. I mean, Nintendo, I haven't got the best rep.</v>

69
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.570
They've been like everything up. I believe that bad.

70
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.630
<v 1>Nintendo and DMC like that right now.</v>

71
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.430
<v 0>With the stuff with the smash tournament. Did you see that as well?</v>

72
00:03:41.431 --> 00:03:44.790
That was a while back. Did you not see that? No, I didn't see that basically.

73
00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:49.200
They're like just a cease and desist in a big tournament that been going on for

74
00:03:49.201 --> 00:03:53.490
a while and everyone was like the cause they were using. Um,

75
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.960
so the, obviously the net code of the switch smash brothers is pretty garbage.

76
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.370
Yeah. So people fan model their own version of it. That's much better. Oh,

77
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.670
it's called like Slippy or something. And they didn't allow that.

78
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.760
And because they were going to use that called slipping because it like actually

79
00:04:08.761 --> 00:04:11.940
runs smoothly because Nintendo online sucks and always has sucked.

80
00:04:11.941 --> 00:04:13.710
And the fact that they pay for it is kind of a jerk. Yeah.

81
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.010
Cause you don't really get anything out of it. Like it's awful. It's so bad.

82
00:04:17.011 --> 00:04:21.630
Like I love Nintendo, but God is that online SOC um, so they,

83
00:04:21.631 --> 00:04:26.370
they cease and desist at them and then they were also sponsoring a Splatoon

84
00:04:26.371 --> 00:04:29.580
tournament. Right. And guess what? Guess what the prize was for the,

85
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.880
so they were giving the prize like sanctioned event.

86
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.950
They they're giving the top prize for a team of five versus five was a $25

87
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.023
Nintendo.

88
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.510
<v 2>Oh my God. Dead.</v>

89
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.330
<v 0>They, they D they canceled the event.</v>

90
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.080
Cause one of the teams had something like free smash or something was like,

91
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.970
like had something along the lines of like the tender cause solidarity with the

92
00:04:53.971 --> 00:04:54.804
smash bros.

93
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.920
<v 1>Prize. You can't even pay</v>

94
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.710
split that can't even pay for the game tournament. Is it.

95
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.600
<v 0>Because it's like, for some reason, intelligence wants their IPS to die. Okay.</v>

96
00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.420
<v 1>Right. Games are sweating, man. Those are just like, Oh,</v>

97
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.340
there's a new competitor in e-sports now.

98
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.540
<v 0>It's eyes wild to me. Cause you just see the,</v>

99
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.180
like the complete difference again, like you said, riot, right? Yeah.

100
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.650
And you have the, what is it?

101
00:05:19.651 --> 00:05:24.300
The Baron Pat red bull pass the red bull power Mercedes drive to victory

102
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.620
fully embracing, like becoming sports and their tenders. Like none of that.

103
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.660
<v 1>The state farm analyst desk.</v>

104
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.400
I remember watching worlds this year and it was so weird just seeing like

105
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.150
literally everything monitored, watching, drinking my G out of my

106
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.410
G feel for sponsoring trash tastes.

107
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:46.311
<v 0>Yeah. It is.</v>

108
00:05:46.311 --> 00:05:50.160
It is funny how it's become like American football where like every single part

109
00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:52.800
of the game is like sponsored. And then you, again,

110
00:05:52.801 --> 00:05:54.810
you have the complete opposite, right. Then 10 tenders. Like, yeah,

111
00:05:54.811 --> 00:05:57.830
we don't want to put any of this because there's a ton of could make money off

112
00:05:57.831 --> 00:06:00.170
it if they really wanted to, there'll be in charge of this.

113
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:02.090
But I just have no interest in it. No, I mean.

114
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.050
<v 1>I mean, they're probably already making enough as he is or.</v>

115
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.540
<v 0>But he's mindset, isn't it? You like,</v>

116
00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:11.110
we've made enough doing it the way we like, we don't want to make more money.

117
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.610
Yeah. Like I guess, which is so odd for a business to say,

118
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.300
because I think what was it like last year tender was the most cash rich company

119
00:06:19.301 --> 00:06:21.100
in Japan. Yeah. Which is insane.

120
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.680
<v 1>I, I think there's something is slightly wrong with that statement.</v>

121
00:06:23.681 --> 00:06:26.130
It's not that they don't want to make more money. Cause I've,

122
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.720
I've from like my experience working with Japanese money, uh,

123
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.850
Japanese companies, they want to make as much money as possible,

124
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.330
but they only want to make as much money as possible using the methods.

125
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.210
They like, they don't want to make money.

126
00:06:37.211 --> 00:06:39.100
It's that they don't know how to make money.

127
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.980
<v 0>Exactly. Exactly. Because they're like, he, he sports. I think</v>

128
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.660
someone like, you know, if you asked me Connor, you can make $10 guaranteed.

129
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.351
What kind of,

130
00:06:50.351 --> 00:06:53.500
you can make a hundred dollars by pushing yourself and being a little crazy.

131
00:06:53.501 --> 00:06:55.900
And it might, it might, might go horribly wrong. Of course,

132
00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.420
every time I'm going to be like a hundred bucks, let's do it. Yeah. Of course.

133
00:06:58.421 --> 00:07:00.060
By the Japanese companies, don't say it that way. Yeah.

134
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.220
<v 1>Nintendo Japanese companies like, yeah.</v>

135
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.140
There's one person in the company that wants to get creative,

136
00:07:05.141 --> 00:07:07.260
but he has to ask 60 other people for yes.

137
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.420
And that might take awhile time that you always say, yeah,

138
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.350
a new trends come out.

139
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.820
<v 0>I get it. Because almost, you know, if you're the, you're the, these companies,</v>

140
00:07:15.821 --> 00:07:18.970
you don't want to get, make a hundred out. People lose that job. Yeah.

141
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:22.990
The safe route. But sometimes the safe route can just lead to being stagnated.

142
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:27.580
<v 1>It's like, how detrimental could it be? If one thing doesn't work out, right?</v>

143
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.730
Like again, Nintendo is the most cash rich company in Japan. Right? It's like,

144
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.713
how much do they have.

145
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.040
<v 0>The lose? It sucks. Cause you just, everyone like wants Nintendo to just do my.</v>

146
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.600
Cause everyone loves. Everyone wants to like scene into everything.

147
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.900
<v 1>Hearing from Nintendo just to do the right thing. You know what I mean?</v>

148
00:07:43.901 --> 00:07:44.800
It's literally.

149
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:49.810
<v 0>The opposite of like EA where everyone just wants to keep up and keep up to the</v>

150
00:07:49.811 --> 00:07:52.030
point where laws have to be made. But with Nintendo,

151
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.510
everyone just wants to see then it's, it's like in the sh you know,

152
00:07:55.511 --> 00:07:57.550
you have those typical shows where, you know,

153
00:07:57.551 --> 00:08:00.670
the brother is addicted to drugs and the whole family is super nice.

154
00:08:00.671 --> 00:08:03.450
And it's like, come on, just please stop. Just come on and get,

155
00:08:03.451 --> 00:08:06.190
get back on your feet, man. Okay. Especially in attendance,

156
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.960
how many chances do we have to give you?

157
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.290
How many rehabs do we need to put you through to see you get back on track.

158
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:15.130
<v 1>After all the W's that they will take in these last couple of.</v>

159
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.560
<v 0>Days, it was just like, kill it. Every.</v>

160
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.140
<v 1>[Inaudible] everyone was like, yep. Nintendo King. Yeah, exactly.</v>

161
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.600
everybody else. And now they're just like, we haven't done the nail.

162
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.750
<v 0>Let's give it a couple of people, lost their.</v>

163
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.880
When they brought out literal cardboard, like,

164
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.540
like this is a company that can release cardboard and we'll eat it up. Like,

165
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:36.430
this is how much we want. I completely forgot about that. Yeah.

166
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.740
Like the day they do like the coolest,

167
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.460
like they don't the contender or just doing their own thing, man.

168
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.260
Like I played ring fit and I was like,

169
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.330
what kind of crackhead came up with this idea to like just exercise with a ring

170
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.890
and like it, and it works and it's good. This is insane.

171
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.460
I would never see this from any other company. It seems like creatively.

172
00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.570
They will take anything.

173
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:02.640
<v 1>Risk possible, but like on a business sense, they're like, no, no,</v>

174
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.250
we do not do business here. We only, we only make things.

175
00:09:06.251 --> 00:09:07.360
Business is not allowed.
