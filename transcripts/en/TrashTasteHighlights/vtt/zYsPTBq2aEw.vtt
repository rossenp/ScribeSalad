00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.880
<v 0>Yeah, because there is there's, there's something there's,</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.930
there's something special about hotel Vegas. I'm just, I'm just like getting,

3
00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:11.010
getting in like a hotel bed and just feeling like you're in a straight jacket.

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.690
I don't know, man. I love that. I don't like it when hotels do that,

5
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:18.600
when they you get in the bed and you're like, what is this?

6
00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:22.430
The world's strongest, man for weight pulls up the like shimmy yourself into it.

7
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.560
I love that feeling. You feel like safe. You feel covered.

8
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.160
This is my safe zone right now. And no one can touch me. I feel like a moth.

9
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.370
I feel like a Caterpillar who was like about to,

10
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.920
what about it?

11
00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:42.690
When they took like half the they under the front of them and it's like,

12
00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:44.970
you're trying to tow a car when you're pulling the out.

13
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.510
You're like this on the bed. Like I just,

14
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:50.970
I just like shimmy myself in and I'm just like, ah,

15
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.970
I feel like I'm back in my mom's room by myself.

16
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.380
I can't even shoot me myself in. It's like,

17
00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:58.980
I'm trying to get into pants five times, five sizes too small. It's like up.

18
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.240
<v 1>I feel bad as well. When they put a lot of light,</v>

19
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.940
they put like a cloth on the bed, like a little like, uh, I don't know,

20
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.980
like that's. They put on the front of the bed and I'm like,

21
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.480
get rid of that out of it.

22
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.570
<v 0>Look the thing that like at the end linen thing or something,</v>

23
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.430
I don't know what it is. You know what that's for? What does that for?

24
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.880
It's for apparently it's an American thing. Apparently it's so that you can.

25
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.820
<v 1>With shoes on the bed. Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.870
<v 0>Oh, I'm about to leave right now. You probably seen it before,</v>

27
00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:27.740
like in hotels where it's just like this one, we'd like table cloths.

28
00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:30.710
I hate that thing at the end of the bed. Right? That's the shoes.

29
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.573
That's the shoes.

30
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.310
But they do that in Japanese hotels where you have to take your shoes off at the

31
00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:35.900
front. Yeah. That's what I'd done.

32
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.720
I had to stay in American hotels as, as the only white as the only white person.

33
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.550
No, no, no. Don't play this on me. I need, I need you correctly.

34
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.320
Shoes on sofas and beds. No, it does. Does that trigger you as it should?

35
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.950
Yes, of course. My parents would hit me if I did that. You kidding me?

36
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.720
I've never understood. I always thought, you know,

37
00:01:56.721 --> 00:02:00.170
when you'd watch like the Simpsons or like American, like TV shows or whatever,

38
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.960
how they would take their shoes off before going to bed,

39
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.770
like they would like keep their shoes on the side of the bed.

40
00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:08.870
And then when they wake up, the first thing they would do is put shoes on.

41
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.730
I just thought that was like parody. I didn't,

42
00:02:10.731 --> 00:02:13.460
I didn't actually think Americans did that. I, I mean,

43
00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:16.460
as much as America is most of the worst. And I'm like, as an Asian,

44
00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:20.750
I'm just like, why did the West just normalize? Why y'all like dirty leg,

45
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.890
gross all shoes on the carpet. That's just gross.

46
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.140
<v 1>That's what blows my mind. I'm like,</v>

47
00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:31.610
you are literally dragging like daily into your carpet. Yeah, bye.

48
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.600
<v 0>And then, and then people complain being like, Oh man,</v>

49
00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:40.550
I hate carpet because it's so dirty. I'm like green shoes. Like whenever I,

50
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.090
whenever I would go to a friend's house and they would be like,

51
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.930
and I go to his house and he would be like, it's okay.

52
00:02:47.931 --> 00:02:51.230
You can keep your shoes on. I'm like. Tell me to take my shoes off.

53
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.220
I want to take my shoes off. I would actually run. Like, I'm not a animal.

54
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.880
I'm not, I'm not going to bring dirt into the house. I don't know what it is.

55
00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.830
But like when I'm.

56
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.050
<v 1>With shoes on, in somebody's house.</v>

57
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.060
<v 0>You're so brilliant. I feel like I'm in a public restroom. Like I don't want to,</v>

58
00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:09.690
I don't want my shoes on. I want to be comfortable, man.

59
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.350
It drives me insane. Like, and there's people.

60
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.020
<v 1>There'll be people coming to me. Like I wear my shoes in bed. Stop.</v>

61
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.500
<v 0>Stop, stop, stop, please. If, if,</v>

62
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.220
if you want to go against the Geneva conventions, just do it, do it in your own

63
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.753
[inaudible] bed.

64
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.310
<v 1>Of all our fans, except for the ones that wear shoes to that.</v>

65
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.620
<v 0>Oh my homie's in bed.</v>

66
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.350
<v 1>Oh my God. Yeah. Like, cause I went to, um, Jesus, my, uh, my editor, uh, Evan.</v>

67
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.280
I went to his house and that was disgusting. He had like, he had like a,

68
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.940
a five inch thick carpet. Right. I don't even know what kinda,

69
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.590
I don't know what call this carpet was supposed to be,

70
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.980
but it definitely wasn't the color that came as this was viral. Dude,

71
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.470
Evan clean fix that carpet man.

72
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.470
And then they all wore like the dirtiest shoes inside. And I was like,

73
00:03:58.471 --> 00:03:59.304
Evan icon.

74
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.560
<v 0>Right? I'm like, have you not heard of house slippers?</v>

75
00:04:01.561 --> 00:04:06.550
Like if you have to wear something what's wrong with bare feet, man socks.

76
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.470
But even, even if it's like it's dude slippers, it's fine. It's clean.
