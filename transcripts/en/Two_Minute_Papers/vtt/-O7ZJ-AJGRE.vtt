00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>Dear fellow scholars. This is two minute papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér.</v>

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.320
Have you heard the saying that whenever we look into the mirror,

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.440
strictly speaking, we don't really see ourselves,

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.300
but we see ourselves from the past from a few nanoseconds ago.

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.100
Is that true? If so, why? And this is indeed true.

6
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.240
And the reason for this is that the speed of light is finite and it has to

7
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:26.490
travel back from the mirror to our eyes.

8
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.080
If you feel that this is really hard to imagine you are in luck because a

9
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:33.270
legendary paper from 2013,

10
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.600
by the name femto photography captured this effect,

11
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.980
I would say it is safe to start holding onto your papers from this point,

12
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.130
basically until the end of this video here,

13
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.720
you can see the super high speed camera capturing how a wave or flight

14
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.780
propagates through a bottle most makes it through,

15
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.750
and some gets absorbed by the bottle cap.

16
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.520
But this means that this mirror example we talked about shall not only be a

17
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:03.900
thought experiment, but we can even witness it ourselves. Yup.

18
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.150
Toy first mirror image second, approximately a nanosecond apart.

19
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.860
So if someone says that you look old, you have an excellent excuse.

20
00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:17.070
Now the first author of this work was Andrew [inaudible]

21
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.070
, who worked on this at MIT. And he is now a professor leading an incredible research group at the university of Wisconsin 

22
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.070
medicine. But wait

23
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.070
, since it is possible to create light transport simulations, in which we simulate the path of many, many millions of light rays to create a beautiful photo, realistic image, Adrianne horrible thought that he would create a simulator that wouldn't just give us the final image, but he would show us the propagation of light in a digital simulated environment. As you see here with this, we can create even crazier experiments because we are not limited to the real 

24
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.903
world light conditions and limitations of the camera.

25
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.980
The beauty of this technique is just unparalleled.

26
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.710
He calls this method transient rendering,

27
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.540
and this particular work is tailored to Excel at rendering caustic patterns.

28
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.090
Acrostic is a beautiful phenomenon in nature where curved surfaces reflect or

29
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:19.620
refract light, thereby concentrating it to a relatively small area.

30
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.640
I hope that you are not surprised when I say that this is the favorite

31
00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:26.100
phenomenon of most light transport researchers.

32
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.860
Now the word about these caustics,

33
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.360
we need a super efficient technique to be able to pull this off. For instance,

34
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.520
back in 2013, we showcased a fantastic scene made by flood Miller.

35
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.530
That was a nightmare to compute,

36
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.750
and it took a community effort and more than a month to accomplish it beyond

37
00:02:45.751 --> 00:02:46.110
that,

38
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.030
the transient render only uses very little memory built on the forearm BMS

39
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.511
technique.

40
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:56.220
We talked about a few videos ago and always arrives to a correct solution

41
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.680
given enough time Bravo.

42
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.740
And we can do all this through the power of science.

43
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.690
Isn't it incredible.

44
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.760
And if you feel a little stranded at home and are yearning to learn more about

45
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:10.594
light transport,

46
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.040
I had a master level course on light transport simulations at the technical

47
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:16.360
university of Vienna.

48
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.530
Since I was always teaching it to a handful of motivated students,

49
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.000
I thought that the teachings shouldn't only be available for the privileged few

50
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.040
who can afford a college education,

51
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.250
but the teachings should be available for everyone.

52
00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.420
So the course is now available free of charge for everyone,

53
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.770
no strings attached.

54
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.070
So make sure to click the link in the video description to get started.

55
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.570
We arrived a full light simulation program from scratch there and learn about

56
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:45.370
physics, the world around us.

57
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.440
And more this episode has been supported by weights and biases in this

58
00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:55.420
post. They show you how to build and track a simple neural network in carers to

59
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:57.850
recognize characters from the Samsung series.

60
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.450
You can even fork this piece of code and start right away.

61
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.070
Also weights and biases provides tools to track your experiments in your deep

62
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:10.600
learning project. Their system is designed to save you a ton of time and money,

63
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.840
and it is actively used in projects at prestigious labs,

64
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.920
such as open AI Toyota research GitHub and more.

65
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.570
And the best part is is that if you're an academic or have an open source

66
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:27.520
project, you can use their tools for free. It really is as good as it gets.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.620
I thanks to weights and biases for their longstanding support and for helping us

71
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.280
make better videos for you. Thanks for watching and for your generous support.
