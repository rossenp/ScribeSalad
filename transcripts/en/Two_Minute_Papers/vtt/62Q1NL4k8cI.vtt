00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.660
<v 0>Dear fellow scholars. This is two minute papers with carriage on I,</v>

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.520
if I hear finally, the full research paper has appeared on open AI five,

3
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.530
which is an AI that plays Dora to a multiplayer online battle arena game

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.920
with a huge cult following. And you may not expect this.

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.550
It is not only as good as some of the best players in the world,

6
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.680
but it also describes the surgery technique. That sounds quite unexpected.

7
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.010
And I promise to tell you what it is later during this video,

8
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.810
this game is a nightmare for any AI to play because of three main reasons.

9
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.260
One, it requires long-term strategy planning,

10
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.260
where it is possible that we make one bad decision.

11
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.640
Then a thousand good ones, and we still lose the game in the end,

12
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.380
finding out which decision led to this loss is immensely difficult. Often,

13
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.310
even for humans too, we have imperfect information,

14
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.440
meaning that we can only see what our units and buildings can see. And three,

15
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.130
even though these learning agents don't look at the pixels of the game,

16
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.340
but they see the world as a big bunch of numbers.

17
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.510
There's just too much information to look at and too many decisions to make

18
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.110
compared to chess or go, or almost anything else.

19
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.660
Despite these difficulties in 2017 open AI showed us an initial version

20
00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:23.190
of their agent that was able to play one versus one games with only one

21
00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:27.540
hero and was able to reliably be dandy a world champion player

22
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.990
that was quite an achievement. However, of course,

23
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.860
this was meant to be a stepping stone towards something much bigger.

24
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.480
That is playing the real Dota two. And just two years later,

25
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.840
the newer version named open AI five has appeared,

26
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.770
defeated the Dora to where our champions and beat

27
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.840
99.4% of human players during an online event that ran for

28
00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:55.530
multiple days. Many voices said that this would never happen.

29
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.860
So two years to pull this off after the first version,

30
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.220
I think was an absolute miracle. Bravo.

31
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.120
Now note that even this version has two key limitations,

32
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.100
one in a normal game,

33
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.990
we can choose from a pool of 117 heroes where the system supports

34
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.190
17 of them.

35
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.410
And two items that allow the player to control multiple characters at once

36
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.520
have been disabled.

37
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.320
If I remember correctly from a previous post of theirs in visibility effects are

38
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:28.860
also neglected because the algorithm is not looking at pixels.

39
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.660
It would either always have this information shown as a bunch of numbers or

40
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.050
never, neither of these would be good design decisions.

41
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.640
So thus invisibility is not part of this technique. Fortunately,

42
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.380
the paper is now available.

43
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.920
So I was really excited to look under the hood for some more details.

44
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.270
So first as I promised, what is this surgery think about?

45
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.850
You see the training of the neural network.

46
00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:57.990
Part of this algorithm took no less than 10 months. Now,

47
00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.070
just imagine for,

48
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.970
to feed an important piece of information into the system or finding a bug

49
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.910
where training is underway in cases like this,

50
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.210
normally we would have to aboard the training and start again.

51
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.290
If we have a new idea as to how to improve the system, again,

52
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.900
we have to abort the training and start again.

53
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.370
If an old version of Dora two comes out with some changes, you got stride.

54
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.473
We start again.

55
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.770
This would be okay if the training took from the order of minutes to hours,

56
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.480
but we are talking 10 months here. This is clearly not practical.

57
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.130
So what if there would be a technique that would be able to apply all of these

58
00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:40.390
changes to a training process that is already underway? Well,

59
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.530
this is what the surgery technique is about here with the blue curve.

60
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.180
You see the agents curating improving over time and the red lines with the black

61
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:52.150
triangles show us the dates for the surgeries.

62
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.720
The author is not that over the 10 month training process,

63
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.170
they have performed approximately one surgery per two weeks.

64
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.430
It seems that getting a doctorate in machine learning research is getting a

65
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:04.330
whole new meaning.

66
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.640
Some of them indeed made an immediate difference while others seemingly

67
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.710
not so much. So how do we assess how potent these surgeries were?

68
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.640
Did they give the agent superpowers? Well,

69
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.500
have a look at the rerun part here,

70
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.210
which is the final Frankenstein's monster agent containing the result of all the

71
00:04:25.211 --> 00:04:27.520
surgeries retrained from scratch,

72
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.720
and just look at how quickly it is trained. And not only that,

73
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.460
but it shoots even higher than the original agent. Absolute madness.

74
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.620
Apparently open AI is employing some proper surgeons over there at their lab.

75
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.560
I love it. Interestingly,

76
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.460
this is not the only time I've seen the word surgery used in the computer

77
00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:50.680
sciences outside of medicine,

78
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.390
a legendary mathematician named Gregory Pearlman who proved the point.

79
00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.310
Curry conjecture also performed a mathematical technique that he called surgery.

80
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.510
What's more,

81
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.400
we even talked about simulating weightlifting and how a simulated AI agent will

82
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:09.700
walk after getting hamstrung and you guys,

83
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:14.170
they tried undergoing surgery to fix it. What a time to be alive.

84
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.370
And again,

85
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.170
an important lesson is that in this project open AI is not spending so much

86
00:05:20.171 --> 00:05:23.170
money and resources just to play video games.

87
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.780
Dota two is a wonderful test bed to see how their AI compares to humans

88
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.550
as complex tasks that involve strategy and teamwork. However,

89
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.410
the ultimate goal is to reuse parts of the system for other complex problems

90
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.230
outside of video games. For instance,

91
00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.860
the algorithm that you've seen here today can also do this.

92
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.330
This episode has been supported by Linode Linode is the world's largest
