00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.230
<v 0>Dear fellow scholars.</v>

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.160
This is two minute papers with Dr. [inaudible] these days.

3
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.840
We see so many amazing uses for learning based algorithms from enhancing

4
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:12.870
computer animations, teaching virtual animals,

5
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:17.040
to walk to teaching self-driving cars, depth perception,

6
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.293
and more,

7
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.530
it truly feels like no field of science is left untouched by these new

8
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:27.510
techniques, including the medical sciences you see in medical imaging.

9
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.490
A common problem is that we have so many diagnostic images out there in the wild

10
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.720
that it makes it more and more infeasible for doctors to look at all of them.

11
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.940
What you see here is a work from scientists at DeepMind health that we covered a

12
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:43.200
few hundred episodes ago.

13
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.360
The training part takes about 14,000 optical coherence, tomography scans.

14
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.420
This is the OCT label that you see on the left.

15
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.870
These images are cross sections of the human retina.

16
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.200
We first start out with this OCD scan,

17
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.150
then a manual segmentation step follows where a Dr. Marks up this

18
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.640
image to show where the relevant parts,

19
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.020
lighter retinal fluids or the elevations of the retinal pigments are

20
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.000
after the learning process.

21
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.800
This method can reproduce the segmentations really well by itself

22
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.660
without the doctor's supervision.

23
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.850
And you see here that the two images are almost identical in these tests.

24
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.010
Now that we have the segmentation map, it is time to perform classification.

25
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.230
This means that we look at this map and assign a probability to each possible

26
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:38.190
condition that may be present. Finally, based on these,

27
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.230
a final verdict is made whether the patient needs to be urgently seen or

28
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.160
just a routine check, or perhaps no check is required.

29
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.510
This was an absolutely incredible piece of work. However,

30
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.130
it is of utmost importance to evaluate these tools together with experienced

31
00:01:56.131 --> 00:01:59.250
doctors and hopefully on international datasets,

32
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.350
since then in this new work,

33
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.600
deep mind has knocked the evaluation out of the park for a system they developed

34
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.720
to detect breast cancer as early as possible.

35
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.550
Let's briefly talk about the technique and then try to explain why it is

36
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.500
sinfully difficult to evaluate it properly. So onto the new problem,

37
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.360
these mammograms contain four images that show the breasts from two different

38
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:25.194
angles.

39
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.970
And the goal is to predict whether the biopsy taken later will be positive for

40
00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:31.260
cancer or not.

41
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.180
This is especially important because early detection is key for treating these

42
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:40.740
patients. And the key question is how does it compare to the expert?

43
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.053
Have a look here.

44
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.560
This is a case of cancer that was missed by all six experts in the study,

45
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.660
but was correctly identified by the AI. And what about this one?

46
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.130
This case didn't work so well. It was caught by all six experts,

47
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.140
but was missed by the AI.

48
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.430
So one reassuring sample and one failed sample. And with this,

49
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.990
we have arrived to the central thesis of the paper, which asks the question.

50
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.060
What does it really take to say that an AI system surpassed human

51
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:16.720
experts to even have a fighting chance in tackling this?

52
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.800
We have to measure false positives and false negatives.

53
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.870
The false positive means that the AI mistakenly predicts that a sample is

54
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:28.840
positive. When in reality it is negative.

55
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.640
The false negative means that the AI thinks that the sample is negative,

56
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.310
whereas it is positive. In reality.

57
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.340
The key is that in every decision domain,

58
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.360
the permissible rates for false negatives and positives is different.

59
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.740
Let me try to explain this through this example in cancer detection,

60
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.870
if we have a sick patient who gets classified as healthy is a grave mistake that

61
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:54.850
can lead to serious consequences.

62
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.260
But if we have a healthy patient who is misclassified as sick,

63
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.640
the positive cases,

64
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:04.870
get a second look from a doctor who can easily identify the mistake.

65
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.120
The consequences in this case are much less problematic and can be remedied by

66
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:14.830
spending a little time checking the samples that the AI was less confident about

67
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.360
the bottom line is that there are many different ways to interpret the data.

68
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.370
And it is by no means trivial to find out which one is the right way to do

69
00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:28.780
so. And now hold onto your papers because here comes the best part.

70
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.370
If we compare the predictions of the AI to the human experts,

71
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.570
we see that the false positive cases in the U S have been reduced by

72
00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:42.520
5.7% while the false negative cases

73
00:04:42.521 --> 00:04:45.370
have been reduced by 9.7%.

74
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.920
That is the Holy grail.

75
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.780
We don't need to consider the cost of false positives or negatives here because

76
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.100
it reduced false positives and false negatives at the same time.

77
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.600
Spectacular.

78
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.460
Another important details is that these numbers came out of an independent

79
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:04.294
evaluation.

80
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.200
It means that the results did not come from the scientists who wrote the

81
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:12.880
algorithm and have been thoroughly checked by independent experts who have no

82
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:14.590
vested interest in this project.

83
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.360
This is the reason why you see so many authors on this paper. Excellent.

84
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.910
Another interesting tidbit is that the AI was trained on subjects from the UK.

85
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.170
And the question was,

86
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.790
how well does this knowledge generalize for subjects from other places?

87
00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.960
For instance,

88
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.640
the United States is this UK knowledge reusable in the U S

89
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.710
I have been quite surprised by the answer because it never saw a sample from

90
00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:46.450
anyone in the us and still did better than the experts on us data.

91
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.330
This is a very assuring property,

92
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.920
and they hope to see some more studies that show how general the knowledge is

93
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.010
that these systems are able to obtain through training.

94
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.090
And perhaps the most important, if you remember one thing from this video,

95
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.440
let it be the following.

96
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.990
This work much like other AI infused medical solutions are not made

97
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.550
to replace human doctors.

98
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.650
The goal is instead to empower them and take off as much weight

99
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:17.450
from their shoulders as possible.

100
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.400
We have hard numbers for this as the results concluded that this work reduces

101
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.730
this workload of the doctors by 88%,

102
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.680
which is an incredible result among other far-reaching consequences.

103
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.150
I would like to mention that this would substantially help not only the work of

104
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:37.880
doctors in wealthier, more developed countries,

105
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.590
but it may single-handedly enable proper cancer detections in more developing

106
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:47.120
countries who cannot afford to check these scans and note that in this video,

107
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.370
we truly have just scratched the surface.

108
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.380
Whatever we talk about here in a few minutes cannot be a description as rigorous

109
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.510
and accurate as the paper itself.

110
00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.290
So make sure to check it out in the video description. And with that,

111
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.790
I hope you'll now have a good feel of the pace of progress in machine learning

112
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:09.020
research. The retinal fluid project was state of the art in 2018,

113
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.780
and now less than two years later,

114
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.730
we have a proper independently evaluated AI based detection for

115
00:07:16.731 --> 00:07:20.870
breast cancer and Bravo deep mind what a time to be alive.

116
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:25.460
