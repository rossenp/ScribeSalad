<v 0>Dear fellow scholars.</v>

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.550
This is terminate papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. In 2019,

3
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.440
the researchers at open AI came up with an amazing learning algorithm that they

4
00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:15.210
deployed on a robot hand that was able to dexterously manipulate a Rubik's

5
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:17.940
cube, even when it was severely hamstrung.

6
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.920
A good game plan to perform such a thing is to first solve the problem in a

7
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:24.090
computer simulation,

8
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.190
where we can learn and iterate quickly and then transfer everything.

9
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:33.810
The agent learned there to the real world and hope that it obtained general

10
00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:37.080
knowledge that indeed can be applied to real tasks,

11
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.290
papers like these are some of my favorites.

12
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.960
If you're one of our core fellow scholars,

13
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.820
you may remember that we talked about walking robots about 200 episodes ago

14
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.740
in this amazing paper. We witnessed a robot, not only learning to walk,

15
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.850
but it could also adjust its behavior and keep walking.

16
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.890
Even if one or multiple legs lose power or get damaged

17
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.300
in this previous work.

18
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.070
The key idea was to allow the robot to learn tasks such as walking,

19
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.470
not only in one optimal way,

20
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.030
but to explore and build a map of many alternative motions,

21
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.220
relying on different body parts.

22
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.560
Both of these papers teach us that working in the real world often shows us

23
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:25.050
new unexpected challenges to overcome.

24
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.240
And this no paper offers a technique to adapt a robot arm to these

25
00:01:30.241 --> 00:01:33.840
challenges. After it has been deployed into the real world,

26
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.570
it is supposed to be able to pick up objects,

27
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.180
which sounds somewhat simple these days,

28
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.430
until we realized that new previously unseen objects may appear in the bin

29
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.900
with different shapes or material models. For example,

30
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.430
reflective and refractive objects are particularly perilous because they often

31
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:56.940
show us more about their surroundings than about themselves.

32
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.660
Lighting conditions may also change after deployment.

33
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.560
The grippers length or shape may change, and many,

34
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.930
many other issues are likely to arise.

35
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.720
Let's have a look at the lighting conditions part.

36
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.740
Why would that be such an issue? The objects are the same.

37
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.090
The scene looks nearly the same. So why is this a challenge?

38
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.700
Well, if the lighting changes,

39
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.380
the reflections change significantly as is the robot arm sees his

40
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:28.530
reflection and thinks that it is a different object.

41
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.360
It just keeps trying to grasp it. After some fine tuning,

42
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.320
this method was able to increase the otherwise not too pleasant,

43
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.730
32% success rate to 63%, much,

44
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.590
much better also extending the raper used to be somewhat of a

45
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:51.120
problem. But as you see here with this technique, it is barely an issue anymore.

46
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.690
Also if we have a somewhat intelligent system and we move the position of the

47
00:02:57.691 --> 00:03:00.130
gripper around nothing really changes.

48
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.170
So we would expect it to perform well. Does it? Well,

49
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.750
let's have a look, unfortunately,

50
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.890
it just seems to be rotating around without too many meaningful actions.

51
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.780
And now hold onto your papers because after using this continual learning

52
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:18.190
scheme, yes,

53
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.380
it improved substantially and makes very few mistakes and can even pick

54
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:27.760
up these tiny objects that are very challenging to grasp with this clumsy hand,

55
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.250
this fine tuning step. Typically it takes an additional hour or at most,

56
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.170
a few hours of extra training and can be used to have these AIS learn

57
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.560
continuously after they are deployed in the real world,

58
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.710
thereby updating and improving themselves.

59
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.950
It is hard to define what exactly intelligence is,

60
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.080
but an important component of it is being able to reuse knowledge and adapt

61
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.090
to new unseen situations. This is exactly what this paper helps with.

62
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.600
Absolute witchcraft, what a time to be alive.

63
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.250
