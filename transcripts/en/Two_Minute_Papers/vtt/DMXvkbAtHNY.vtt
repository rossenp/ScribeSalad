00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.080
Dear fellow scholars,
this is two minute with Károly Zsolnai-Fehér.

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.820
I think this is one of the more important things that happened in AI research

3
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:10.950
lately.
In the last few years,

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.980
we have seen deep mind defeat the best go players in the world and after open

5
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:21.291
Ai's venture in the game of Dota two it's time for deep mind to shine again as

6
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:25.470
they take on starcraft.
Two a real time strategy game.

7
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.180
The depth and the amount of skill required to play this game is simply

8
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.043
astounding.

9
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.560
The search space of starcraft two is so vast that it exceeds both chess and even

10
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:40.620
go by a significant margin.
Also,

11
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.090
it is a game that requires a great deal of mechanical skill split second

12
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:46.020
decision making,

13
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.320
and we have imperfect information as we only see what our units can see.

14
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.750
A nightmare situation for any AI.

15
00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.260
Deepmind invited the beloved pro player PLO to play a few games against our new

16
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:04.530
stock f two AI that goes by the name Alpha Star.

17
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.340
Note that the yellow is a professional player who is easily in the top 1% of

18
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:13.370
players or even better meet grandmaster.

19
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.670
For those who play starcraft two this video is about what happened during this

20
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:22.671
event and later I will make another video that describes the algorithm that was

21
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:24.480
used to create this Ai.

22
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.040
The paper is still under review so it will take a little time until I can get my

23
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:31.110
hands on it.
At the end of this video,

24
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.520
you will also see the inner workings of this Ai.
Let's dive in.

25
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.120
This is an AI that looked at a few games played by human players and after that

26
00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:46.401
initial step it learned by playing itself for about 200 years.

27
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.670
In our next episode,
you will see how this is even possible,

28
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.740
so I hope you are subscribed to the series.

29
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.940
You'll see here that the AI controls the blue units and Tlo.

30
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.410
The human player plays red right at the start of the first game.

31
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.770
The Ai did something interesting.
In fact,

32
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:07.020
what is interesting is what it didn't do.

33
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.470
It started to create new buildings next to its nexus.

34
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.690
Instead of building a wall off that you can see here using a Wolof is considered

35
00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:20.670
standard practice in most games and the AI use these buildings to not wall off

36
00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:24.540
the entrance but shield away the workers from possible attacks.

37
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.000
Now note that this is not unheard of,

38
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.770
but this is also not a strategy that is widely played today and is considered

39
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.730
nonstandard.

40
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.590
It also built more worker units than what is universally accepted as standard.

41
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.510
We found out later that this was partly done in anticipation of losing a few of

42
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:44.670
them early on.
Very cool.

43
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.060
Then almost before we even knew what happened,

44
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.090
it won the first game a little more than seven minutes in which is very quick.

45
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.150
Noting that in game time is a little faster than real time.

46
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.510
The thought process of Tlo at this point is that that's interesting that okay,

47
00:03:12.771 --> 00:03:16.780
well the AI plays aggressively and managed to pull this one off.

48
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.460
No big deal.
We'll we'll fire up the second game and the in the meantime,

49
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.960
a few interesting details.

50
00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.610
The goal of setting up the details of the SAG rhythm was that the number of

51
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:32.611
actions performed by the AI roughly matches a human player and hopefully it

52
00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:35.430
still plays as well or better.

53
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.470
It has to make meaningful strategic decisions.

54
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.550
You see here that this checks out for the average actions every minute,

55
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:43.780
but if you look here,

56
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.150
you'll see around the tail end here that there are times when it performs more

57
00:03:48.151 --> 00:03:52.870
actions than humans and this may enable play styles that are not accessible for

58
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:54.970
human players.
However,

59
00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.110
note that many times it also does miraculous things with very few actions.

60
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.330
Now what about another important detail reaction time?

61
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.820
The reaction time of the AI is set to 350 milliseconds,

62
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.020
which is quite slow.

63
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.470
That's excellent news because this is usually a common angle of criticism for

64
00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:18.070
Game Ais.
The Ai also sees the whole map at once,

65
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.450
but it is not given more information than what its units can see.

66
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.250
This perhaps is the most commonly misunderstood detail,
so it is worth noting.

67
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:28.970
So in other words,

68
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
it sees exactly what a human would see if the human would move the camera around

69
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.610
very quickly,
but it doesn't have to move the camera,

70
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.420
which adds additional actions and cognitive load to the human.

71
00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.240
So one might say that the AI has an edge here.

72
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.140
The Ai plays these games independently.
What's more,

73
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.810
each game was played by a different AI,

74
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.170
which also means that they do not memorize what happened in the last game like a

75
00:04:55.171 --> 00:04:57.520
human would.
Early in the next game,

76
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.010
we can see the utility of the wall off in action,

77
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.130
which is able to completely prevent the ais early attack later that game,

78
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.810
the AI use disruptors,

79
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.960
the unit which if controlled with such level of expertise can decimate the army

80
00:05:12.091 --> 00:05:16.420
of the opponent with area of damage by killing multiple units at once.

81
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.790
It has done an outstanding job picking away at the army of Tlo.

82
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.170
Then after getting a significant advantage,

83
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.380
Alpha star loses it with a few sloppy place,

84
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.370
and by deciding to engage aggressively while standing in tight choke points,

85
00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.120
you can see that this is not such a great idea.

86
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.680
This was quite surprising as this is considered to be starcraft one o one

87
00:05:39.681 --> 00:05:42.950
knowledge right there during the remainder of the match.

88
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.980
The commentators mentioned that they play and watch games all the time and the

89
00:05:48.211 --> 00:05:52.470
AI came up with an army composition that they have never seen during a

90
00:05:52.471 --> 00:05:55.850
professional match and the AI won this one too.

91
00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.370
After game,
it became clear that these agents can play any style in the game,

92
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:02.860
which is terrifying.

93
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.590
Here you can see an alternative visualization that shows a little more of the

94
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.720
inner workings of the Neuron Network.

95
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.690
We can see what information it gets from the game,

96
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.530
the visualization of neurons that get activated within the network,

97
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.980
what locations and units are considered for the next actions and whether the AI

98
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.620
predict itself as the winner or the loser of the game.
If you look carefully,

99
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.760
you will also see the moment when the agent becomes certain that it will win

100
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:36.360
this game.
I could look at this all day long and if you feel the same way,

101
00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.490
make sure to visit the video description.

102
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.440
I have a link to the source video for you.

103
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.630
The final result against Tlo was five to zero.

104
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:46.363
<v 1>How strong the agent</v>

105
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.410
I actually lost every single over fire.

106
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.710
So that's something

107
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.730
<v 0>and he mentioned that Alpha Star played very much like a human does and almost</v>

108
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:04.350
always manage to outmaneuver him.
However,

109
00:07:04.351 --> 00:07:09.030
Tlo also mentioned that he is confident that open playing more training matches

110
00:07:09.031 --> 00:07:12.030
against these agents.
He would be able to defeat the AI.

111
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.380
I hope he will be given a chance to do that.

112
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.040
This AI seem strong but steel beatable.

113
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.120
I would also note that many of you would probably expect the later versions of

114
00:07:22.121 --> 00:07:24.670
Alpha Star.
It be way better than this one.

115
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.530
The good news is that the story continues and we'll see whether that's true.

116
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.310
So at this point the deep mind scientists said maybe we could try to be a bit

117
00:07:34.311 --> 00:07:38.150
more ambitious and asked,
can you bring us someone better?

118
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.110
And in the meantime pressed that training button on the AI again,

119
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.040
incomes manner,
a top tier pro player,

120
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.890
one of the best protest players in the world.

121
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.440
This was a nerve wracking moment for deep mind scientists as well because their

122
00:07:53.441 --> 00:07:55.450
agents played against each other.

123
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.470
So they only knew the ais wind rate against a different API,

124
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.520
but they didn't know how they would compete against a top pro player.

125
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.760
It may still have holes in its strategy.
Who knows what will happen.

126
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.600
Understandably,
they had very little confidence in winning this one.

127
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:17.200
What they didn't expect is that the new AI was not slightly improved or somewhat

128
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.610
improved?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

129
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.660
This new AI was next level.

130
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:28.020
This app of improved agents among many other skills had incredibly crisp

131
00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:32.070
micromanagement of each individual unit in the first game.

132
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.260
We've seen it pulling back injured units,

133
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.450
but still letting them attack from afar,

134
00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:41.510
masterfully leading to an early win for the AI against Manna in the first game.

135
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.940
He and the commentators were equally shocked by how well the agent plate,

136
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.310
and I will add that.

137
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:51.880
I remember from watching many games from a now inactive player by the name

138
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:56.970
marine king a few years ago and I vividly that he played some of his games so

139
00:08:57.771 --> 00:09:01.340
well.
The commentators said that there is no better way to put it.

140
00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.020
He played like a God.

141
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:08.210
I am almost afraid to say that this micromanagement was even more crisp than

142
00:09:08.211 --> 00:09:12.700
that.
This AI plays phenomenal games in later matches.

143
00:09:12.701 --> 00:09:17.590
The Ai did things that seemed like blunders like attacking on ramps and standing

144
00:09:17.591 --> 00:09:22.591
in choke points or using unfavorable unit compositions and refusing to change it

145
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:27.610
and get this.
It's still won all of those games,

146
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:32.600
five to zero against a top pro player.
Let that sink in.

147
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:42.370
<v 2>I would consider myself a good player,
right?
I lost every single one.</v>

148
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.170
I'm

149
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.880
just trying to digest it.

150
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.200
<v 0>The competition was closed by a match where the AI was asked to also do the</v>

151
00:09:58.201 --> 00:09:59.220
camera management.

152
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:04.510
The agent was still very competent but somewhat weaker and as a result lost this

153
00:10:04.511 --> 00:10:08.500
game,
hence the zero or one part in the title.

154
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.970
My impression is that it was asked to do something that it was not designed for

155
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.780
and expect a future version to be able to handle this use case as well.

156
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.640
I will also come and Manna for his solid game plan for this game and also huge

157
00:10:21.641 --> 00:10:23.710
respect for deep mind for their sportsmanship.

158
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.940
Interestingly in this match manner also started a worker oversaturation of

159
00:10:28.941 --> 00:10:30.620
strategy that I mentioned earlier.

160
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.760
This he learned from Alpha Star and used it in his winning game.

161
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.560
Isn't that amazing?

162
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:41.850
Deep Mind also offered a Reddit Ama where anyone could ask them questions to

163
00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:44.880
make sure to clear up any confusion.
For instance,

164
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:47.160
the actions per minute part has been addressed.

165
00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:51.450
I've included the link to that for you in the video description to go from a

166
00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:53.820
turn turn-based perfect information game.

167
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:58.930
Let go to a real time strategy game of imperfect information in about a year.

168
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.580
Sounds like science fiction to me and yet here it is.

169
00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.820
Also know that deep mines goal is not to create a god like starcraft two AI.

170
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.040
They want to solve intelligence,

171
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.660
not starcraft two and they use this game as a vehicle to demonstrate its

172
00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:18.930
longterm decision making capabilities against human players.

173
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.580
One more important thing to emphasize is that the building blocks of Alpha star

174
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.150
are meant to be reasonably general Ai Algorithms,

175
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:31.830
which means that parts of this AI can be reused for other things.

176
00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:36.910
For instance,
may Sasabe is mentioned weather prediction and climate modeling.

177
00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:41.800
As examples.
If you take only one thought from this video,
let it be this one,

178
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:46.300
I urge you to watch all the matches because what you are witnessing may very

179
00:11:46.301 --> 00:11:48.040
well be history in the making.

180
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.380
I put a link to the whole event in the video description plus plenty more

181
00:11:52.381 --> 00:11:56.290
materials including other people as analysis,
manners,

182
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.120
personal experience of the event,

183
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:02.320
his breakdown of his games and what was going through his head during the event.

184
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:07.030
I highly recommend checking out his fifth game,
but really go through them all.

185
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.170
It's a ton of fun.

186
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:12.790
I made sure to include a more skeptical analysis of the game as well to give you

187
00:12:12.791 --> 00:12:15.370
a balanced portfolio of insights.
Also,

188
00:12:15.371 --> 00:12:19.180
huge respect for deep mind and the players who practice their chops for many,

189
00:12:19.181 --> 00:12:22.840
many years and have played really well under immense pressure.

190
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.090
Thank you all for this delightful event.

191
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.860
It really made my day and the ultimate question is how long did it take to train

192
00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:32.800
these agents?
Two weeks.
Wow.

193
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.140
And what's more after the training step,

194
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:39.910
the Ai can be deployed on an inexpensive consumer desktop machine and this is

195
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.410
only the first version.

196
00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:46.120
This is just a taste and it would be hard to overstate how big of a milestone

197
00:12:46.121 --> 00:12:48.790
this is and now scientists are deep,

198
00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:52.810
might have sufficient data to calculate the amount of resources they need to

199
00:12:52.811 --> 00:12:55.840
spend to train the next even more improved agents.

200
00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:00.130
I am confident that they will also take into consideration the feedback from the

201
00:13:00.131 --> 00:13:04.630
starcraft community when creating this next version.
What a time to be alive.

202
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:09.850
What do you think about all this?
Any predictions?
Is this harder than Dota two?

203
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:14.650
Let me know in the comments section below and remember we humans build up new

204
00:13:14.651 --> 00:13:18.850
strategies by learning from each other.
And of course the AI,

205
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.000
as you have seen here,
doesn't care about any of that.

206
00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:26.410
It doesn't need intuition and can come up with unusual strategies.

207
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:31.120
The difference now is that these strategies work against some of the best human

208
00:13:31.121 --> 00:13:31.954
players.

209
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.610
Now it's time for us to finally start learning from an AI GG.

210
00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:40.840
Thanks for watching and for your generous support.
And I'll see you next time.
