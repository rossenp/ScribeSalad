00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.060
<v 0>Dear fellow scholars. This is two minute papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. It is</v>

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:04.060
 time for some fluids, as many of you know, in this series, we often talk about fluid simulations and sometimes the examples showcase a fluid splash, but not much else. However, in 

3
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:04.060
real

4
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:04.060
 production environments, these simulations often involve complex scenes with many objects that interact with each other and therein lies the problem computing. These interactions is called 

5
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:04.060
coupling

6
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:04.060
 and it is very difficult to get right, but is necessary for many of the beautiful scenes you will see throughout this video, getting this right is of utmost importance. If we wish to create a realistic simulation where fluids and solids interact. So the first question would be as many of these techniques 

7
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:04.060
built upon the material point method or MPM in

8
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:04.060
 short, why not just use that? Well, let's do exactly that and see how it does on the scene. 

9
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:04.060
Last

10
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:04.893
 job, the liquid ball on the bunny. And a lot of it has now stuck to the bunny. This is not supposed to happen. So what about the improved version of MPM?

11
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.510
Yep. Still too sticky.

12
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.810
And now let's have a look at how this new technique handles this situation.

13
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.290
I want to see dry and floppy bunny ears.

14
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.310
Yes. Now that's what I'm talking about now, then that's great.

15
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.240
But what else can this do a lot more? For instance,

16
00:01:38.241 --> 00:01:42.260
we can engage in the favorite pastimes of the computer graphics researcher,

17
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.160
which is of course destroying objects in a spectacular manner.

18
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.960
This is going to be a very challenging scene. Ouch.

19
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.930
And now let physics take care of the rest.

20
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.620
This was a harrowing but beautiful simulation.

21
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.150
And we can try to challenge the algorithm even more. Here.

22
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.090
We have three elastic spheres field with water,

23
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.100
and now watch how they deform as they hit the ground and how the water

24
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.320
gushes out exactly as it should.

25
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.120
And now hold onto your papers because there is a great deal to be seen in this

26
00:02:17.121 --> 00:02:21.800
animation, but the most important part remains invisible. God,

27
00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:26.510
this all three spheres use a different hyper LSD city model to

28
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:30.230
demonstrate that this new technique can be plugged into many existing

29
00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:31.064
techniques.

30
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.750
And it works so seamlessly that I don't think anyone would be able to tell the

31
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:39.950
difference and it can do even more. For instance,

32
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.780
it can also simulate wet sand. Wow. And I say, wow,

33
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.800
not only because of this beautiful result, but there is more behind it.

34
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.400
If you are one of our hardcore longtime fellow scholars,

35
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.410
you may remember the three years ago,

36
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.290
we needed an entire paper to pull this off.

37
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.530
This algorithm is more and can stimulate this kind of interaction between liquid

38
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.350
and granular media as an additional side effect.

39
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.250
We can also simulate dropping this creature into a piece of fluid.

40
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.270
And as we increase the density of the creature, it sinks in,

41
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.500
in a realistic manner.

42
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.200
While we are lifting frogs and help an elastic bear, take a bath.

43
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.020
Let's look at why this technique works so well.

44
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.640
The key to achieving these amazing results in a reasonable amount of time is

45
00:03:29.641 --> 00:03:33.510
that this new method is able to find these interfaces where the fluids and

46
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.190
solids meet and handles their interactions in a way that we can advanced a time

47
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.640
in our simulation in larger steps than previous methods.

48
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.350
This leads to not only these amazingly general and realistic simulations,

49
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.890
but they also run faster. Furthermore,

50
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.540
I am very happy about the fact that now we can not only simulate these difficult

51
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.350
phenomenon, but we don't even have to implement a technique for each of them.

52
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.420
We can take this one and simulate a wide variety of fluid, solid interactions.

53
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.280
What a time to be alive.

54
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.570
This episode has been supported by weights and biases in this post.

55
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.830
They show you how to use their system to train a deep reinforcement learner,

56
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.100
to become adapt at the carpool balancing problem.

57
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.900
This is the algorithm that was able to master Atari breakout that we often talk

58
00:04:21.901 --> 00:04:22.980
about in this series.

59
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.120
Weights and biases provides tools to track your experiments in your deep

60
00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:31.710
learning projects. Their system is designed to save you a ton of time and money,

61
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.010
and it is actively used in projects at prestigious labs,

62
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.300
such as open AI Toyota research GitHub and more.

63
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.950
And the best part is that if you have an open source academic or personal

64
00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:48.930
project, you can use their tools for free. It really is as good as it gets.
