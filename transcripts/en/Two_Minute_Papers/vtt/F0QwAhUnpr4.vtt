00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.260
<v 0>Dear fellow scholars.</v>

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.850
This is two minute papers with Dr. Carriage on IFA here today, with the power.

3
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.380
<v 1>Of computer graphics research,</v>

4
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.240
we can use our computers to run fluid simulations, simulate, immersing,

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.220
a selection of objects into jelly or tear meat in a way that much like

6
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:20.370
in reality, it tears along the muscle fibers.

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.620
If we look at the abstract of this amazing new paper, we see this quoting.

8
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.870
This allows us to trace high-speed motion of objects, colliding, aghast, curved,

9
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:31.680
geometry,

10
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.030
to reduce the number of constraints to increase the robustness of the simulation

11
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.150
and to simplify the formulation of the solver.

12
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.330
What this sounds impossible,

13
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.820
but at the very least outrageously good,

14
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.020
let's look at three examples of what it can do and see for ourselves.

15
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.660
If it can live up to its promise, one,

16
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.790
it can simulate a steering mechanism full of joins and contact. Yup.

17
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.070
An entire servo steering mechanism is simulated with a prescribed mass ratio,

18
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.323
loving it.

19
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.430
I hereby declare that it passes inspection and now we can take off for some

20
00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:12.150
off-roading. All of the movement is simulated really well.

21
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.660
And wait a minute, hold on to your papers.

22
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.080
Are you seeing what I am seeing? Look,

23
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.820
even the tire affirmations are part of the simulation. Beautiful.

24
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.920
And now let's do a stress test and race through a bunch of obstacles and see

25
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.520
how well those tires can take it. At the end of the video,

26
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.260
I will tell you how much time it takes to simulate all this and note that I had

27
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:41.850
to look three times because I could not believe my eyes to

28
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.730
harassed it ocean. Or in other words,

29
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.320
we can smash an independent marble into a bunch of others and their combined

30
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:51.450
velocity will be correctly computed.

31
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.950
We know for a fact that the computations are correct because when I stopped the

32
00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:59.670
video here, you can see that the marbles themselves are smiling.

33
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.320
The joys of curved, geometry and specular reflections. Of course,

34
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.640
this is not true because if we attempt to do the same with a classical earlier

35
00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:13.620
technique by the name, position based dynamics, this would happen. Yes,

36
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.960
the velocity is became erroneously large,

37
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.730
and the marbles jump off of the wire and they still appear to be very happy

38
00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:23.160
about it. Of course, with the new technique,

39
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.810
the simulation is much more stable and realistic talking about stability.

40
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.900
Is it stable only in a small scale simulation?

41
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.620
Or can it take a huge scene with lots of interactions?

42
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.270
Would it still work well, less run a stress test and find out,

43
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.570
haha, this animation can run all day long and not one thing appears to behave

44
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.540
incorrectly, loving this three.

45
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.770
It can also simulate these beautiful high-frequency roles that we often

46
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:55.290
experience. When we drop a coin on a table,

47
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.770
this kind of interaction is very challenging to simulate correctly because of

48
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:04.450
the high-frequency nature of the motion and the curve geometry that interacts

49
00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:05.284
with the table.

50
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.640
I would love to see a technique that algorithmically generates the sound for

51
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:13.780
this. I could almost hear it sound in my head, believe it or not,

52
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.770
they should be possible and is subject to some research attention in computer

53
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:20.380
graphics. The animation here was given,

54
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.480
but the sounds were algorithmically generated. Listen,

55
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.770
if you're one of our orgy fellow scholars who were here when this episode was

56
00:03:34.771 --> 00:03:36.660
published, hundreds of videos ago,

57
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.280
so how much do we have to wait to simulate all of these crazy physical

58
00:03:41.281 --> 00:03:42.114
interactions?

59
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.380
We mentioned that the tires are stiff and take a great deal of computation to

60
00:03:46.381 --> 00:03:50.550
simulate properly. So as always all-nighters right,

61
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.080
Nope. Look at that. Holy mother of papers,

62
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.580
the car example takes only 18 milliseconds to compute per frame,

63
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.330
which means 55 frames per second. Goodness,

64
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.670
not only do we not need an all-nighter,

65
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.340
we don't even need to leave for a coffee break.

66
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.750
And there are only marbles took even less. And whew,

67
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.460
the high-frequency coin example needs only one third of a millisecond,

68
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.230
which means that we can generate more than 3000 frames with it per second.

69
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.530
We not only don't need an all-nighter or a coffee break,

70
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.460
we don't even need to wait at all. Now at the start of the video,

71
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.270
I noted that the claim in the abstract sounds almost outrageous.

72
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.920
It is because it promises to be able to do more than previous techniques,

73
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.590
simplify the simulation algorithm itself,

74
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.840
make it more robust and do all this while being blazing fast.

75
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.370
If someone told me that there is a work that does all this at the same time,

76
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.170
I would say that give me that paper immediately because I do not believe a word

77
00:04:55.171 --> 00:04:58.320
of it. And yet it really lives up to its promise.

78
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.930
Typically as a research field matures,

79
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.290
we see new techniques that can do more than previous methods,

80
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.950
but the price to be paid for it is in the form of complexity.

81
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.910
The algorithms get more and more involved over time. And with that,

82
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.550
they often get slower and less robust.

83
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.960
The engineers in the industry have to decide how much complexity they are

84
00:05:18.961 --> 00:05:22.950
willing to shoulder to be able to simulate all of these beautiful interactions.

85
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.630
Don't forget these code bases have to be maintained and improved for many,

86
00:05:27.631 --> 00:05:28.464
many years.

87
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.670
So choosing a simple base algorithm is of utmost importance,

88
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.720
but here,

89
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.800
none of these factors need to be considered because there is nearly no trade off

90
00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:42.330
here. It is simpler, more robust and better at the same time.

91
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.900
It really feels like we are living in a science fiction world.

92
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.790
What a time to be alive,

93
00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.530
huge congratulations to scientists at Nvidia and the university of Copenhagen

94
00:05:52.531 --> 00:05:55.830
for this don't forget they could have kept the results for themselves,

95
00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.350
but they chose to share the details of this algorithm with everyone free of

96
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:02.870
charge. Thank you so much for doing this.

97
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.040
What you see here is a report for a previous paper that we covered in the

98
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.280
series, which was made by weights and biases, weights,

99
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:13.880
and biases provides tools to track your experiments in your deep learning

100
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.170
project. Their system is designed to save you a ton of time and money,

101
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:21.500
and it is actively used in projects at prestigious labs,

102
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.790
such as open AI Toyota research GitHub and more.

103
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.440
And the best part is that if you have an open source academic or personal

104
00:06:30.441 --> 00:06:35.420
project, you can use their tools for free. It really is as good as it gets.
