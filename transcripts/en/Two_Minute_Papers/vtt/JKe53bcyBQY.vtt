00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.200
<v 0>Dear fellow scholars.</v>

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.790
This is two minute papers with Dr. [inaudible] due to popular request.

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:06.510
Today,

4
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.950
we will talk about Neuralink Elon Musk's neural engineering company that he

5
00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:13.800
created to develop brain machine interfaces.

6
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.750
And your first question likely is why talk about Neurolink now there was a

7
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:23.250
recent event and another one last year as well. Why did I not cover that?

8
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.360
Well,

9
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.800
the launch event from last year in these promised a great deal in this series,

10
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.450
we often look at research works that are just one year apart and Marvel at the

11
00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:37.950
difference. Scientists have been able to make in that tiny, tiny timeframe.

12
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.140
So first let's talk about their paper from 2019, which will be incredible.

13
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.530
And then see how far they have come in a year,

14
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.770
which as you will see is even more incredible.

15
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.360
The promise is to be able to read and write information to,

16
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.260
and from the brain to accomplish this. As of 2019,

17
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.310
they used this robot to insert the electrodes into your brain tissue.

18
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.150
You can see the insertion process here from the closeup image.

19
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.480
You might think that this is a huge needle, but in fact,

20
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.440
this needle is extremely tiny. You can see a penny for scale here.

21
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.060
This is the story of how this rat got equipped with a USB port.

22
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.260
As this process is almost like inserting microphones into its brain.

23
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.650
Now we are able to read the neuro signals of this rat.

24
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.020
Normally these are analog signals,

25
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.020
which are red and digitized by neural links implant.

26
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.150
And now this brain data is represented as a digital signal. Well,

27
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.730
at first, this looks a bit like gibberish.

28
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.960
Do we really have to undergo a brain surgery to get a bunch of these quickly

29
00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:47.250
curves? What do these really do for us? We can have the neural link chip,

30
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.150
analyze the signals and look for action potentials in them.

31
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.600
These are also referred to as spikes because of their shape.

32
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.830
That sounds a bit better, but still what does this do for us?

33
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.970
Let's see here, we have a person with a mouse in their hand.

34
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.220
This is an outward movement with the mouse and then reaching back simple

35
00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:09.054
enough.

36
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.530
Now what you see here below is the activity of an example in neuron.

37
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.450
When nothing is happening, there is some firing, but not much activity.

38
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.460
And now look when reaching out this neuron fires a great deal.

39
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.540
And suddenly when reaching back again, nearly no activity.

40
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.620
And this means that this neuron is tuned for an outward motion.

41
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.480
And this other one is tuned for the returning motion and all this is now

42
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:40.680
information that we can read in real time. And the more neurons we can read,

43
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.820
the more complex motion we can read. Absolutely incredible.

44
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.940
However, this is still a little difficult to read.

45
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.160
So let's order them by what kind of motion makes them excited and dare

46
00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:57.840
we go suddenly this is a much more organized way to present all this neuro

47
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.740
activity. And now we can detect what kind of motion the brain is thinking about.

48
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.920
This was the reading part, and that's just a start.

49
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.820
What is even cooler is that we can just invert this process,

50
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.570
read the spiking activity. And just by looking at these,

51
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.370
we can reconstruct the motion.

52
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.410
The human wishes to perform with this brain machine interfaces can be created

53
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.020
for people with all kinds of disabilities,

54
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.720
where the brain can still think about the movement,

55
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.560
but the connection to the rest of the body is severed. Now,

56
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.190
these people only have to think about moving and then,

57
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.390
then yearling device will read it and performed the cursor movement for them.

58
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.490
It really feels like we live in a science fiction world and all the signal

59
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:46.570
processing is now possible automatically. And in real time,

60
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.970
and all we need for this is this tiny,

61
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:53.740
tiny chip that takes just a few square millimeters. And don't forget,

62
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.100
that is just version one from 2019.

63
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.410
Now onwards to the 2020 event where it gets even better

64
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.340
than your rolling device has been placed into Gertrude, the pig's brain.

65
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.270
And here you'll see it in action. We see the rest of you here.

66
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.850
And luckily we already know what it means.

67
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.530
This lays bare the neuro action potentials before our eyes or in

68
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.840
afterwards, which neuron is spiking. And exactly when below with blue,

69
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.610
you see these activities summed up for our convenience and this way you will not

70
00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:32.230
only see, but here too, as these neurons are tuned for snout boobs.

71
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.480
In other words, you will see and hear that the more does not is stimulated.

72
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.810
The more neural activity, it will show less listen,

73
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.920
And all this is possible today. And in real time,

74
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.000
that was one of the highlights of the 2020 progress update event.

75
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.930
But it went further much further. Look,

76
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.340
this is a pig on a treadmill, and here you'll see the rain signal readings.

77
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.650
This signal marked with a circle shows where a joint or limb is about to

78
00:05:10.651 --> 00:05:13.830
move where the utter dimmer colored signal is.

79
00:05:13.831 --> 00:05:16.620
The chips prediction as to what is about to happen.

80
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.530
It takes into consideration periodicity and predicts higher frequency movement.

81
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.630
Like the sharp turns really well.

82
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.260
The two are almost identical,

83
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.220
and that means exactly what you think it means today.

84
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.260
We can not only read and write,

85
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.950
but even predict what the pig's brain is about to do.

86
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.800
And that was the part where I fell off the chair.

87
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.360
When I watched this event live,

88
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.190
you can also see the real and predicted workspace positions for these body parts

89
00:05:47.191 --> 00:05:52.020
as well. Very close. Now,

90
00:05:52.021 --> 00:05:55.740
note that there's a vast body of research in brain machine interfaces.

91
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.740
And many of these were possible in lab conditions and neural links quest

92
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:04.730
here is to make them accessible for a wider audience within the next decade.

93
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.460
If this project further improves at this rate,

94
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:12.320
it could help many paralyzed people around the world live a longer and more

95
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:13.190
meaningful life.

96
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.150
And then your all enhancement aspect is also not out of question.

97
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.280
Just thinking about summoning.

98
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:23.240
Your Tesla might also summon it with sounds like science fiction.

99
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:24.740
And based on these results,

100
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.360
you see that it may even be one of the simplest tasks for a neural link chip in

101
00:06:29.361 --> 00:06:33.500
the future. And who knows one day, maybe with this device,

102
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.860
these videos could be beat into your brain much quicker.

103
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.420
And this series would have to be renamed from two minute papers to two second

104
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:45.320
papers, or maybe even two microsecond papers.

105
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.870
They might actually fit into two minutes.

106
00:06:47.871 --> 00:06:51.740
Like the title says now that would truly be a miracle. Huge,

107
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:55.280
thanks to scientists and neuro link for our discussions about the concepts

108
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:59.120
described in this video, and then ensuring that you get accurate information.

109
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.100
This is one of the reasons why our coverage of the 2020 event is way too late

110
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.850
compared to many mainstream media outlets, which leads to a great deal,

111
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:12.620
less views for us, but it doesn't matter. We are not maximizing views. Here.

112
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.670
We are maximizing learning note that they are also hiring.

113
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.610
If you wish to be a part of their vision and work with them,

114

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.160
such as open AI Toyota research GitHub and more.

122
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.810
And the best part is that if you have an open source academic or personal

123
00:07:56.811 --> 00:08:01.790
project, you can use their tools for free. It really is as good as it gets.
