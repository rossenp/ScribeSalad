00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.990
<v 0>Dear fellow scholars. This is two minute papers with casual NIFA here.</v>

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.060
If we study the laws of fluid motion from physics and write the computer program

3
00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:12.510
that contains these laws, we can create beautiful simulations.

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.830
Like the one you see here,

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.850
the amount of detail we can simulate with these programs is increasing every

6
00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:21.750
year. Not only due to the fact that hardware improves over time,

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.670
but also the pace of progress in computer graphics research is truly remarkable.

8
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.580
However, when talking about fluid simulations,

9
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.870
we often see a paper produce a piece of geometry that evolves over time.

10
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.460
And of course the more detailed this geometry is the better. However,

11
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.080
look at this, it is detailed, but something is really missing here.

12
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.510
Do you see it? Well,

13
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.160
let's look at the revised version of the simulation to find out what it is. Yes,

14
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.490
form spray and the bubble particles are now present.

15
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.680
And the quality of the simulation just got elevated to the next level. Also,

16
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.940
if you look at the source text, you see that this is a paper from 2012,

17
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.480
and it describes how to add these effects to a fluid simulation.

18
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.160
So why are we talking about a paper that's about eight years old,

19
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.563
not only that,

20
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.320
but this work was not published at one of the most prestigious journals,

21
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.420
not even close. So why? Well, you'll find out in a moment,

22
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.620
but I have to tell you that I just got to know about this paper a few days ago

23
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.940
and it is so good. It has single handedly changed the way.

24
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.950
I think about research note that a variant of this paper has been implemented in

25
00:01:34.951 --> 00:01:37.110
a blender plugin called flip fluids.

26
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.290
Blender is a free and open source modeler program,

27
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.990
which is a complete powerhouse. I love it.

28
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.360
And this plugin embeds this work into a modern framework and boy does it

29
00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:49.410
come to life in there?

30
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.210
I have rerun one of their simulations and rendered the high resolution animation

31
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.890
with lad transport. The fluid simulation took about eight hours. And as always,

32
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.450
I went a little overboard with the light transport that took about 40 hours.

33
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.550
Have a look. It is unreal how good it looks. My goodness.

34
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.110
It is one of the miracles of the world that we can put a piece of Silicon in our

35
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:15.360
machines and through the power of science,

36
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.250
explain fluid dynamics to it so well that such a simulation can come out of it.

37
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.770
I have been working on these for many years now,

38
00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.790
and I am still shocked by the level of progress in computer graphics research.

39
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.690
Let's talk about three important aspects of this work. First,

40
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.730
it proposes one unified technique to add form spray and bubbles in

41
00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:37.590
one, go to the fluid simulation.

42
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.280
One technique to model all three in the paper,

43
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.920
they are collectively called diffuse particles.

44
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.440
And if these particles are deeply underwater,

45
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.880
they will be classified as bubbles. If they are on the surface of the water,

46
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.960
they will be foreign particles. And if they are further above the surface,

47
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.410
we will call them spray particles. With one method,

48
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.930
we get all three of those lovely tool.

49
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.800
When I had shown you this footage wet and without the diffuse particles,

50
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.150
normally I would need to re simulate the whole fluid domain to add these

51
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:13.090
advanced effects. But this is not the case at all.

52
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.420
These particles can be added as a post-processing step,

53
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.520
which means that I was able to just run the simulation once and then decide

54
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:24.400
whether to use them or not just one click.

55
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.690
And here it is with the particles removed. Absolutely amazing.

56
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.970
And three, perhaps the most important part, this technique is so simple.

57
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.520
I could hardly believe the paper when I saw it.

58
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.620
You see normally to be able to simulate the formation of bubbles or form,

59
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.870
we will need to compute the Weyburn numbers,

60
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.080
which requires expansive surface tangent computations,

61
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.180
and more instead the paper four fits that and goes with the notion that

62
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:56.980
bubbles and form appear at regions where air gets trapped within the fluid.

63
00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.810
On the back of this knowledge,

64
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.640
they note that wave crests are an example of that and propose a method to find

65
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.900
these wave crests by looking for regions where the curvature of the fluid

66
00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:10.570
geometry is high and locally Combax,

67
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.190
both of these can be found through very simple expressions. Finally,

68
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.870
air is also trapped when fluid particles move rapidly towards each other,

69
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.960
which is also super simple to compute and evaluate.

70
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.570
The whole thing can be implemented in a day.

71
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.860
And it leads to absolutely killer fluid animations. You see,

72
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.360
I have a great deal of admiration for a 20 page long technique that models

73
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.820
something very difficult perfectly,

74
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.760
but I have at least as much admiration for an almost trivially simple

75
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.250
method that gets us to 80% of the perfect solution.

76
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.770
This paper is the letter. I love it. This really changed my thinking,

77
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.030
not only about fluid simulation papers, but this paper is so good.

78
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.150
It challenged how I think about research in general.

79
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.200
It is an honor to be able to talk about beautiful works like this to you.

80
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.230
So thank you so much for coming and listening to these videos.

81
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.770
Note that the paper does more than what we've talked about here.

82
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.990
It also proposes a method to compute the lifetime of these particles, Taz us,

83
00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:16.570
how they get attracted by water and more,

84
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.080
make sure to check out the paper in the description for more on that.

85
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.870
If you're interested, go and try blender,

86
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.810
that tool is completely free for everyone to use.

87
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.450
I have been using it for around a decade now,

88
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.260
and it is truly incredible that something like this exists as a community

89
00:05:32.261 --> 00:05:36.670
effort, the flip fluids plugin is a paid edition. If one pays for it,

90
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.720
it can be used immediately. Or if you spend a little time,

91
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.430
you can compile it yourself.

92
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.690
And this way you can get it for free respect for the plugin authors for making

93
00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:50.020
such a gentle business model. If you don't want to do any of those,

94
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.050
even blender has a usable built in fluid simulator.

95
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.740
You can do incredible things with it, but it can't produce the particles.

96
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.730
I am still stunned by how simple and powerful this technique is.

97
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.180
The lesson here is that you can really find gems anywhere,

98
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.180
not just around the most prestigious research venues.

99
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.340
I hope you got inspired by this,

100
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.840
and if you wish to understand how these fluids work some more or write your own

101
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:17.450
simulator, I put a link to my master's thesis,

102
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.170
where I try to explain the whole thing as intuitively as possible.

103
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.000
And it also comes with the full source code free of charge for a simulator that

104
00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:27.320
runs on your graphics card.

105
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.920
If you feel so voracious that even that's not enough,

106
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.330
I will also highly recommend [inaudible] Kim's book on fluid engine development.

107
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.760
That one also comes with free source code.

108
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.140
This episode has been supported by weights and biases here. You see it,
