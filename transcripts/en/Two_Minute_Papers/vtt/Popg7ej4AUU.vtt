00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.200
<v 0>Dear fellow scholars.</v>

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.100
This is two minute papers with Dr. [inaudible]. I have been yearning for while.

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.250
<v 1>Transport paper, and goodness was I ecstatic when reading this one?</v>

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.580
And by the end of the video, I hope you will be too.

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.680
And now we only have to go through just about 30 years of light transport

6
00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:23.480
research. As some of, you know, if we immerse ourselves into the art of flight,

7
00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:24.590
transport simulations,

8
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.060
we can use our computers to simulate millions and millions of light rays and

9
00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:33.680
calculate how they get absorbed or scattered off of our objects in a virtual

10
00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:35.180
scene. Initially,

11
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.960
we start out with a really noisy image and as we add more AEs,

12
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.870
the image gets clear and clear over time.

13
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.550
The time it takes for these images to clean up depends on the complexity of the

14
00:00:46.551 --> 00:00:51.140
geometry and our material models, but it typically takes awhile.

15
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.120
This micro planet scene mostly contains vegetation, which are math objects.

16
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.270
These we also refer to as diffuse materials.

17
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.960
These typically convert very quickly as you see,

18
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.710
we get meaningful progress on the entirety of the image within the first two

19
00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:11.000
minutes of the rendering process. And remember in light transport simulations,

20
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.640
noise is public enemy. Number one,

21
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.620
this used a technique called path tracing Les referred to it as the okay

22
00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:22.880
technique. And now let's try to use path tracing this, okay.

23
00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:25.880
Technique to render the stories in a glass enclosure.

24
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.030
This is the first two minutes of the rendering process,

25
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.970
and it does not look anything like the previous scene.

26
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.900
The previous one was looking pretty smooth after just two minutes.

27
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.740
Whereas here you see, this is indeed looking very grim.

28
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.110
We have lots of these fireflies,

29
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.680
which will take us up to a few days of computation time to clean up,

30
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.600
even if we have a modern, powerful machine. So why did this happen?

31
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.070
The reason for this is that there are tricky cases for specular light transport

32
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.230
that take many, many millions,

33
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.970
if not billions of light rays to compute properly specular here

34
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.150
means mirror like materials. Those can get tricky.

35
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.860
And the stories that has been enclosed in there is also not doing too well.

36
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.490
So this was past tracing the okay technique.

37
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.200
Now let's try a better technique called metropolis light transport.

38
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.330
This method is the result of a decade of research and is much better in dealing

39
00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:24.320
with difficult scenes.

40
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.020
This particular variant is a proud Hungarian algorithm by a scientist called

41
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.260
trouble Kellerman and his colleagues at the technical university of Budapest.

42
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.221
For instance,

43
00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:38.210
here's a snippet of our earlier paper on a similarly challenging scene.

44
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.310
This is how the okay path tracer did. And in the same amount of time,

45
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.660
this is what metropolis light transport the better technique could do.

46
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.430
This was a lot more efficient. So let's see how it does with the tourists.

47
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.570
Now that's unexpected.

48
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.160
This is indeed a notoriously scene to render,

49
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.410
even for metropolis light transport,

50
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.210
the better technique as you see the reflected light patterns that we also refer

51
00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:10.330
to as caustics on the floor are much cleaner,

52
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.090
but the Taurus is still not giving up.

53
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.670
Let's jump another 15 years of light transport research and use a technique that

54
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:23.560
goes by the name manifold exploration. Let's call this the best technique.

55
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.140
Wow. Look at how beautifully it improves the image.

56
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.190
It is not only much cleaner, but also converges,

57
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.450
much more gracefully.

58
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.650
It doesn't go from a noisy image to a slightly less noisy image,

59
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.900
but almost immediately gives us a solid baseline and new cleaned

60
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:46.180
up paths also appear over time.

61
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.670
This technique is from 2012 and it truly is mind boggling how good it

62
00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:52.360
is.

63
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.710
This technique is so difficult to understand and implement that to the best of

64
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:57.400
my knowledge,

65
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.380
the number of people who can and have implemented it properly is exactly

66
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.483
one.

67
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.320
And that one person is [inaudible] one of the best minds in the game and

68
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:09.160
believe it or not,

69
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.060
he wrote this method as a PhD student in light transport research.

70
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.570
And today as a professor at EPFs Switzerland,

71
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.730
he and his colleagues set out to create a technique that is as good as many fold

72
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.050
exploration, the best technique, but is much simpler.

73
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.980
Well, good luck with that. I thought when skimming through the paper,

74
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.710
let's see how it did. For instance,

75
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:37.480
we have some caustics at the bottom of a pool of water has expected lots of

76
00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:42.430
Firefly noise with the okay, pass tracer, and now hold onto your papers.

77
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.330
And here is the new technique. Just look at that.

78
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.200
It can do so much better in the same amount of time.

79
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.730
Let's also have a look at this scene with lots and lots of specular micro

80
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:57.610
geometry, or in other words, lens.

81
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.960
This is also a nightmare to render with the okay, pass tracer.

82
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.340
We have lots of flickering from one frame to the next and here you see the

83
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:08.950
result with a new technique. Perfect.

84
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.320
So it is indeed possible to take the best technique many for exploration,

85
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.450
and re-imagine it in a way that ordinary humans can also implement huge

86
00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:23.980
congratulations to the authors of this work that I think is a crown achievement

87
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.910
in large transport research. And that's why I was ecstatic.

88
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.550
When I first read through this incredible paper,

89
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.110
make sure to have a look at the paper and you will see how they borrowed a nice

90
00:05:35.111 --> 00:05:39.130
little trick from a recent work in nuclear physics to tackle this problem.

91
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.570
The presentation of the paper and the talk video with the details is also

92
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.960
brilliant. And I urge you to have a look at it in the video description.

93
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.540
This whole thing got me so excited.

94
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.780
I was barely able to fall asleep for several days now,

95
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.160
what a time to be alive now, who I will look through some more results,

96
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.153
the paper,

97
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.270
if you feel a little stranded at home and are thinking that this light transport

98
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:03.710
thing is pretty cool.

99
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:08.330
I held a master level course on this topic at the technical university of

100
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:12.350
Vienna. Since I was always teaching it to a handful of motivated students,

101
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.760
I thought that the teachings shouldn't only be available for a privileged few

102
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.710
who can afford a college education,

103
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.720
but the teachings should be available for everyone free education for

104
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:25.340
everyone. That's what I want.

105
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.170
So the course is available free of charge for everyone, no strings attached.

106
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.020
So make sure to click in the video description to get started.

107
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.640
We write a full light simulation program from scratch and learn about physics,

108
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.810
the world around us.

109
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:44.000
And more also note that my former PhD advisor Mika femur is looking

110
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:46.820
to hire a postdoctoral researcher in this area,

111
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.420
which is an amazing opportunity to push this field forward.

112
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.940
The link is available in the video description.

113
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.720
