00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.380
<v 0>Dear fellow scholars. This is two minute papers with Dr. [inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:04.380
. We hear many opinions every day on how tax policy should change, what we should do and how it would affect us. But of course, whenever we change something, we have to be mindful of 

3
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:04.380
its ramifications. Experimenting with tax policies. Willy-nilly

4
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:04.380
 is of course ill-advised in the real world, but we are researchers. So we can create our little virtual world, populate them with virtual character AIS, and we can experiment all we want here. Just imagine a future where a politician comes and says, I will lift up the 

5
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:04.380
middle-class by creating policy X. Well, let's simulate that policy X

6
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.213
 in a virtual world and see if it actually works as they promised that would be glorious. But of course, I know, I know wishful thinking, right? But maybe with this paper, not so much. Look, these workers are enforcement learning agents, which means that they observe their environment and choir what the tax rates and other parameters are and decide how to proceed.

7
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.580
They start working,

8
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.500
they pay their taxes and over time they learn to maximize their own

9
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.750
wellbeing. Given the tax system. And this is the inner loop of the simulation.

10
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.230
Now comes the even cooler part, the outer loop.

11
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.830
This means that we have not only simulated worker AIS,

12
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.280
but simulated policymaker AAS too.

13
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.470
And they look at inequality who wealth distribution and other market dynamics

14
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.780
and adjust the tax policy to maximize something that we find important.

15
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.230
And here in lies, the key of the experiment,

16
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.140
let's start with the goal of the simulation.

17
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.580
We seek a tax policy that maximizes equality and

18
00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.890
productivity at the same time.

19
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.860
This is of course immensely difficult.

20
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.620
Every decision comes with its own trade offs.

21
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.660
We'll talk about the results in a moment,

22
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.520
but first let's Marvel at the fact that it simulates agents with higher and

23
00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:11.280
lower scales. And not only that, but we,

24
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.270
these specialization starts appearing. For instance,

25
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.920
the lower skill agents started gathering and selling materials where the higher

26
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.180
skill agents started buying up the materials to build houses.

27
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.980
The goal of the policymaker AI is to maximize the equality and

28
00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:32.730
productivity of all of these agents. As a comparison,

29
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.570
it also simulated the 2018 U S federal tax rate,

30
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.760
an analytical tax formula where the marginal tax rate decreases with income,

31
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.410
a free market model, and also proposed its own tax policies.

32
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.850
So how well did it do let's have a look at the results together,

33
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.870
the free market model excels in maximizing productivity,

34
00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.010
which sounds great until we find out that it does this at the cost of

35
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.540
equality. Look, the top agent owns almost everything,

36
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.240
leaving nearly nothing for everyone else.

37
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.490
The U S federal tax and analytical models strike a better balance between the

38
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:14.440
two, but neither seems optimal.

39
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.150
So where is the AI economics model on this curve? Well,

40
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.300
hold onto your papers because it is here,

41
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.830
it improved and the trade off between equality and productivity by

42
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:30.640
16% by proposing a system that is harder to gain,

43
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.620
that gives a bigger piece of the pie for the middle-class and subsidizes lower

44
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.970
skill AI workers.

45
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.260
And do not forget that the key here is that it not only proposes things,

46
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.100
but it can prove that these policies serve everyone,

47
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.920
at least within the constraints of this simulation.

48
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.620
Now that's what I call a great paper.

49
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.860
And there is so much more useful knowledge in this paper.

50
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.900
I really urge you to have a look. It is a fantastic read and needless to say,

51
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.260
I'd love to see more research in this area. For instance,

52
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.060
I'd love to know what happens if we start optimizing for sustainability as well.

53
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.050
And these objectives can be specified in this little virtual world,

54
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.310
and we can experiment with what happens if we are guided by these requirements

55
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.240
and now onwards to more transparent tax policies.

56
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.100
What a time to be alive.

57
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.080
Perceptive labs is a visual API for TensorFlow carefully designed to make

58
00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:28.840
machine learning as intuitive as possible.

59
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.670
This gives you a faster way to build out models with more transparency into how

60
00:04:33.671 --> 00:04:38.050
your model is architected, how it performs and how to debug it.

61
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.610
Look, it lets you toggle between the visual modeler and the code editor.

62
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.230
It even generates visualizations for all the model variables and gives you

63
00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:51.520
recommendations both during modeling and training and does all this

64
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.600
automatically.

65
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.010
I only wish I had a tool like this when I was working on my neural networks

66
00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.330
