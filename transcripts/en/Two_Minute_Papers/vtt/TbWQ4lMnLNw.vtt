00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.180
<v 0>Dear fellow scholars. This is two minute papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér.</v>

2
00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.570
Whenever we look at these amazing research papers on physical simulations,

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.770
it is always a joy, seeing people discussing them in the comment section.

4
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.970
<v 1>However,</v>

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.290
one thing that caught my attention is that some people comment about how things

6
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:24.150
look and not on how things move in these papers, which is fair enough.

7
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.530
And to this end,

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.850
I will devote this episode to talk about a few amazing techniques in light

9
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:32.550
transport simulations. But first things first,

10
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.650
when talking about physics simulations,

11
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.430
we are talking about the technique that computes, how things move.

12
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.620
And then we typically run a light simulation program that computes how things

13
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:46.590
look. The two are completely independent,

14
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.730
which means that it is possible that the physical behavior of bread breaking

15
00:00:50.731 --> 00:00:55.650
here is correct, but the bread itself does not look perfectly realistic.

16
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.570
The second part depends on the quality of the light simulation and the

17
00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:01.650
materials used there.

18
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.620
<v 0>We can create such an image by simulating the path of millions and millions of</v>

19
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:07.500
light rays.

20
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.210
And initially this image will look noisy and as we add more and more res,

21
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.570
this image was slowly clean up over time.

22
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.390
<v 1>If we don't have a well optimized program,</v>

23
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.940
this can take from hours to days to compute,

24
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.560
we can speed up this process by carefully choosing where to shoot these rays.

25
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.890
And this is a technique that is called important sampling,

26
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.830
but then around 1993,

27
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.390
an amazing paper appeared by the name bi-directional pass tracing that

28
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:40.620
proposed that we don't just start building light paths from one direction,

29
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.990
but two instead one from the camera and one from the light source and

30
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:47.160
then connect them.

31
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.750
This significantly improved the efficiency of these light simulations. However,

32
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.820
it opened up a new can of worms.

33
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.820
There are many different ways of connecting these paths,

34
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.040
which leads to mathematical difficulties.

35
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.210
<v 0>For instance, we have to specify the probability of a light path forming,</v>

36
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.710
but what do we do if there are multiple ways of producing this light path,

37
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.350
there will be multiple probabilities.

38
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.100
What do we do with all this stuff to address this?

39
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.110
Eric Veatch described the magical algorithm in his thesis and thus multiple

40
00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:20.760
important sampling was born.

41
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.830
<v 1>I can say without exaggeration that this is one of the most powerful techniques</v>

42
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.050
in all for the realistic rendering research,

43
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.180
what multiple important sampling or from now on MIS in short

44
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.980
does is combined these multiple sampling techniques in a way that accentuates

45
00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:40.890
the strength of each of them. For instance,

46
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.040
you can see the image created by one sampling technique here,

47
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.680
and the image from a different one here,

48
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.530
both of them are quite noisy, but if we combine them with MIS,

49
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.510
we get this instead in the same amount of time and much smoother,

50
00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.740
less noisy image.

51
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.160
<v 0>In many cases,</v>

52
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.050
this can truly bring down the computation times from several hours to several

53
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:08.650
minutes, absolute witchcraft later,

54
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.430
even more advanced techniques appeared to accelerate the speed of these light

55
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.480
simulation programs.

56
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.650
<v 1>For instance,</v>

57
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.420
it is now not only possible to compute light transport between points in space,

58
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.720
but between a point and a beam. Instead,

59
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.740
you see the evolution of an image using this forearm beam based technique.

60
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.300
This way we can get rid of the point based noise and get a much,

61
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.250
much more appealing rendering process.

62
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.860
Delete author of these beam paper is [inaudible] who three years later

63
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.880
ended up being the head of the rendering group at the amazing Disney research

64
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:44.590
lab. Around that time.

65
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:48.940
He also hired me to work with him at Disney on a project I can talk about,

66
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.970
which was an incredible and life-changing experience.

67
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.840
And I will be forever grateful for his kindness, by the way,

68
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.580
he's now a professor at the Dartmouth university and just keeps pumping out one

69
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:02.320
killer paper after another.

70
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.330
<v 0>So as you might have guessed,</v>

71
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.870
if it is possible to compute light transport between two points,

72
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.210
the point and a beam later, it became possible to do this between two beams.

73
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.020
None of these are for the faint of the heart, but it works really well,

74
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.270
but there is a huge problem.

75
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.800
These techniques work with different dimensionalities or in other words,

76
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.600
they estimate the final result so differently that they cannot be combined with

77
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:29.890
multiple important sampling.

78
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.210
<v 1>That is indeed a problem because all of these have completely different</v>

79
00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:35.560
strengths and weaknesses.

80
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.900
And now hold onto your papers because we have finally arrived to the main paper

81
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.823
of this episode.

82
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.080
It bears the name UPB P which stands for unifying points, beams,

83
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.943
and paths,

84
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.120
and it formulates multiple important sampling between all of these different

85
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:54.130
kinds of flight, transport simulations.

86
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.990
Basically what we can do with this is through every advanced simulation program

87
00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:01.390
we can think of together and outcomes,

88
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.770
a super powerful version of them that combines all their strengths and

89
00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:08.290
nullifies, nearly all of their weaknesses.

90
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.650
<v 0>It is absolutely unreal here.</v>

91
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.610
You see four completely different algorithms running, and as you can see,

92
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.850
they are noisy and smooth at very different places.

93
00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.510
They are good at computing, different kinds of light transport.

94
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.730
And now hold onto your papers because this final result with the UPB P technique

95
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.950
is this wow light transport on steroids.

96
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.060
<v 1>While we look at some more results, I will note that in my opinion,</v>

97
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.720
this is one of the best papers ever written in light transport research.

98
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.860
The crazy thing is that I hardly ever hear anybody talk about it.

99
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.710
If any paper would deserve a bit more attention.

100
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.110
So I hope this video will help with that.

101
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.500
And I would like to dedicate this video to Jaroslav.

102
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.280
Chovanec the first author of this absolutely amazing paper who has tragically

103
00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:01.400
passed away a few months ago in my memories.

104
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.420
I think of him as the true King of multiple important sampling.

105
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.430
<v 0>And I hope that now you do,</v>

106
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:12.050
to note that MIS is not limited to light transport algorithms.

107
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.610
It is a general concept that can be used together with a mathematical technique

108
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.470
called Monte-Carlo integration,

109
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.240
which is used pretty much everywhere from finding out what an electromagnetic

110
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:27.110
field looks like to financial modeling and much, much more.

111
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.320
<v 1>If you have anything to do with Monte-Carlo integration,</v>

112
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.590
please read Eric breaches thesis and this paper.

113
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.960
And if you feel that it is a good fit,

114
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.680
try to incorporate multiple important sampling into your system.

115
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.960
You'll be glad you did. Also,

116
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.500
we have recorded my lectures of a master level course on light transport

117
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:49.370
simulations at the technical university of Vienna. In this course,

118
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.990
we're at such a light simulation program from scratch and it is available free

119
00:06:53.991 --> 00:06:56.390
of charge for everyone, no strings attached.

120
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.630
So make sure to click the link in the video description to get started.

121
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.033
Additionally,

122
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:05.660
I have implemented a small one dimensional example of MIS if you wish to pick it

123
00:07:05.661 --> 00:07:06.494
up and try it.

124
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.610
That's also available in the video description while talking about the technical

125
00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:15.080
university of Vienna, we are hiring for a PhD and a postdoc position.

126
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.880
The call here about lighting simulation for architectural design is advised by

127
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:24.860
my PhD advisor, Mika Vima, who I highly recommend apply. Now,

128
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.710
if you feel qualified, the link is in the video description.

129
00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:32.000
Thanks for watching and for your generous support. And I'll see you next time.
