00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.290
<v 0>Dear fellow scholars.</v>

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.990
This is two minute papers with Dr. Carriage on NIFA here series. We often.

3
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.180
<v 1>Talk about smoke and fluid simulations,</v>

4
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.350
and sometimes the examples showcase the beautiful smoke plume,

5
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.730
but not much else. However, in real production environments,

6
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.470
these simulations often involve complex scenes with many objects that interact

7
00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:25.280
with each other and therein lies the problem computing.

8
00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:29.330
These interactions is called coupling and it is very difficult to get, right,

9
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.290
but it's necessary for many of the scenes you will see throughout this video,

10
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.400
this new graphics paper builds on a technique called the lattice Boltzmann

11
00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:41.030
method and promises a better way to compute this two way.

12
00:00:41.031 --> 00:00:44.090
Coupling for instance, in this simulation two way,

13
00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:48.560
coupling is required to compute how this fire is smoke trail propels,

14
00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:49.700
the rocket upward.

15
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.110
So coupling means interaction between different kinds of objects.

16
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.490
But what about the two-way part? What does that mean? Exactly?

17
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.740
Well, first let's have a look at one way. Coupling as the box moves here,

18
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.110
it has an effect on the smoke plume around it.

19
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.500
This example also showcases one way coupling where the falling plate stirs up

20
00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:13.490
the smoke around it.

21
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.080
The parts with the higher Reynolds numbers showcase more turbulent flows.

22
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.080
Typically that's the real good stuff. If you ask me

23
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.260
and now onto to wake up link in this case, similarly to previous ones,

24
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.600
the boxes are allowed to move the smoke,

25
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.850
but the added two-way coupling part means that now the smoke is

26
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.130
also allowed to blow away the boxes.

27
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.980
What's more the vortices here on the right.

28
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.150
We're even able to suspend the red box in the air for a few seconds,

29
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.930
an excellent demonstration of a beautiful phenomenon.

30
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.030
Now let's look at the previous example with the dropping plate and see what

31
00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:57.420
happens. Yes, indeed. As the play drops,

32
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.370
it moves the smoke and as the smoke moves, it also blows away the boxes.

33
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.573
<v 2>Whew.</v>

34
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.890
<v 1>Due to improvements in the coupling computation,</v>

35
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.840
it also simulates these kinds of 40 sees much more realistically than previous

36
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:17.160
works. Just look at all this magnificent progress in just two years.

37
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.220
So what else can we do with all this?

38
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.170
What are the typical scenarios that require accurate to wake up link? Well,

39
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.030
for instance, it can perform an incredible tornado simulation and you see here,

40
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.430
and there's an alternative view where we only see the objects moving about.

41
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.100
So all this looks good,

42
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.640
but really how do we know how accurate this technique is?

43
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.040
And now comes my favorite part.

44
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.110
And this is when we let reality be our judge and compare the simulation results

45
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.150
with real real-world experiments,

46
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.830
hold onto your papers while you observe the real experiment here on the left.

47
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.430
And now the algorithmic reproduction of the same scene here.

48
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.380
How close are they? Goodness. Very, very close.

49
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.640
I will stop the footage at different times so we can both evaluate it better.

50
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.710
Love it. The technique can also undergo the wind tunnel test.

51
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.330
Here's the real footage and here's the simulation.

52
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.840
And it is truly remarkable how close this is able to match it.

53
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.730
And I was wondering that even though,

54
00:03:26.731 --> 00:03:29.460
as someone who has been doing fluids for a while now,

55
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.050
if someone cropped this part of the image and told me that it is real-world

56
00:03:34.051 --> 00:03:38.340
footage, I would have believed that in a second absolute insanity.

57
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.350
So how much do we have to wait to compute a simulation like this? Well,

58
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.870
great news. It uses your graphics card,

59
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.190
which is typically the case for the moral demand,

60
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.250
very fluid simulation algorithms out there,

61
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.790
but the more elaborate ones typically don't support it,

62
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.390
or at least not without a fair amount of additional effort.

63
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.030
The quickest example was this, as it was simulated in less than six seconds,

64
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.070
which I find to be mind blowing the smoke simulation with box movements in a few

65
00:04:08.071 --> 00:04:10.740
seconds, I am truly out of words.

66
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.170
The rocket launch scene took the longest with 16 hours while the falling

67
00:04:16.171 --> 00:04:20.310
plate example with a strong draft that threw the boxes around with about four

68
00:04:20.311 --> 00:04:22.320
and a half hours of computation time,

69
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.570
the results depend greatly on Delta T, which is the size of the timestamps,

70
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.740
or in other words,

71
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.390
in how small increments we can advanced time when creating these simulations to

72
00:04:33.391 --> 00:04:36.180
make sure we don't miss any important interactions.

73
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.910
You see here that in the rocket example,

74
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.710
we have to simulate roughly a hundred thousand steps for every second of

75
00:04:43.711 --> 00:04:46.410
video footage. No wonder it takes so long.

76
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.090
We have an easier time with this scene where these timestamps can be 50 times

77
00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:55.620
larger without losing any detail. And hence it goes much faster.

78
00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.680
The grid resolution also matters a great deal,

79
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.660
which specifies how many spatial points the simulation has to take place in the

80
00:05:03.661 --> 00:05:07.230
higher, the resolution of the grid, the larger the region we can cover.

81
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.460
And the more details we can simulate as most research works,

82
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.250
this technique doesn't come without limitations. However,

83
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.050
it is less accurate if we have simulations involving thin rods and shells,

84
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.760
and typically uses two to three times more memory than a typical simulator

85
00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:28.350
program. If these are the only trade-offs to create all this marvelous footage,

86
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.920
sign me up this very second. Overall,

87
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.360
this paper is extraordinarily well-written and of course it has been accepted to

88
00:05:36.361 --> 00:05:37.500
the SIGGRAPH conference.

89
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.610
