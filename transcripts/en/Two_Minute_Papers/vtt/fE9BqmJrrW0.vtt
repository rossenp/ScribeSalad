00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.200
<v 0>Dear fellow scholars. This is two minute papers with Dr. [inaudible] here.</v>

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.250
Perhaps the best part of being a computer graphics researcher is creating

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.190
virtual worlds on a daily basis and computing,

4
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:15.570
beautiful simulations in these worlds. And what you see here is not one,

5
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.430
but two kinds of simulations.

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.530
One is a physics simulation that computes how these objects move and

7
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.630
a transport simulation that compute how these objects look in this video.

8
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.500
We were strictly talking about the physics simulation part of what you see on

9
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:34.380
the screen to simulate these beautiful phenomenon.

10
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.730
Many recent methods build on top of a technique called the material point

11
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:39.540
method.

12
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.980
This is a hybrid simulation technique that uses both particles and grids to

13
00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:48.210
create these beautiful animations. However, when used by itself,

14
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.080
we can come up with a bunch of cases that it cannot simulate properly.

15
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.320
One such example is cracking and tiering phenomenon,

16
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.130
which has been addressed in this great paper that we discussed earlier this

17
00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:02.610
year. With this method, we could smash Orioles candy,

18
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:05.670
crabs pumpkin's and much, much more.

19
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.520
It even supported tearing this bread apart.

20
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.180
This already looks quite convincing. And this series,

21
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.940
I always say two more papers down the line,

22
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.270
and it will be improved significantly. Today.

23
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.150
We are going to have a two minute papers moment of truth,

24
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.180
because this is a follow-up work from Joshua Whopper,

25
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.760
the first author of the previous Bret paper.

26
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.380
And you can immediately start holding onto your papers because this work is one

27
00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:34.830
of the finest I have seen. As of late with this,

28
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.090
we can enrich our simulations with Anna zoetropic damage and

29
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.420
elasticity. So what does that mean? Exactly?

30
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.400
This means that it supports more extreme topological changes in these virtual

31
00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:51.900
objects. This leads to better material separation when the damage happens.

32
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.570
For instance, if you look here on the right,

33
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.710
this was done by a previous method for the first site, it looks good.

34
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.690
There is some bouncy behavior here,

35
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.870
but the separation line is a little too clean.

36
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.870
Now let's have a look at the new method.

37
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.520
Whew. Now that's what I'm talking about. Let's have another look.

38
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.540
I hope you now see what I meant by the previous separation line,

39
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.540
being a little too clean, remarkably,

40
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.340
it also supports changing a few intuitive parameters like ETA the crack

41
00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:27.420
propagation speed,

42
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.460
which we can use to further tailor the simulation to our liking artists are

43
00:02:32.461 --> 00:02:36.090
going to love this. We can also play with the young modulars,

44
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.320
which describes the materials resistance against fractures on the left.

45
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.390
It is quite low and makes the material tear apart easily much like a

46
00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:47.700
sponge. As we increase it a bit,

47
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.620
we get a stiffer material which gives us this glorious floppy behavior.

48
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.080
Let's increase it even more and see what happens. Yes,

49
00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.630
it is more resistant against damage. However, in return,

50
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.190
it gives us some more vibrations after the break. It is not only realistic,

51
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.420
but it also gives us the choice with these parameters to tailor our simulation

52
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:13.540
results to our liking. Absolutely incredible.

53
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.910
Now then if you have been holding onto your papers so far now squeeze that

54
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:23.590
paper because previous methods were only capable of tearing off a small

55
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:27.160
piece or only a strip of this virtual pork.

56
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.560
Let's see what this new work will do.

57
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.900
Yes. It can also simulate peeling off an entire layer glorious,

58
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.210
but it's not the only thing we can peel.

59
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.630
It can also deal with small pieces of this mozzarella cheese.

60
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.540
I must admit that I have never done this myself.

61
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.720
So this will be the official piece of homework for me.

62
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.170
And for the more curious minds out there after watching this video,

63
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.010
let me know in the comments, if it went the same way in your kitchen,

64
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.550
as it did in the simulation here, you get extra credit.

65
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.260
If you post the picture too. And finally, if we tear this piece of meat apart,

66
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.850
you see that it takes into consideration the location of the fibers and the

67
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:14.440
tiering takes place, not in an arbitrary way, but much like in reality,

68
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.390
it tears along the muscle fibers. So how fast is it?

69
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.440
We still have to wait a few seconds for each frame in these simulations.

70
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.300
None of them took too long.

71
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.350
There's a fish steering experiment in the paper that went very quickly.

72
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.990
Half a second for each frame is a great deal.

73
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.150
The pork experiment took nearly 40 seconds for each frame and the most demanding

74
00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:41.230
experiments involved, a Lance and bones, frankly,

75
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.520
they were a little too horrific to be included here, even for virtual bodies.

76
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.870
But if you wish to have a look,

77
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.830
make sure to click the paper in the video description, but wait,

78
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.990
are you seeing what I am seeing these examples talk more than

79
00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.940
a thousand times longer to compute? Goodness. How can that be?

80
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.150
Look, as you see here in these cases,

81
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.000
the Delta T step is extremely tiny,

82
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.500
which means that we have to advance the simulation with tiny, tiny timestamps.

83
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.060
That takes much longer to compute how tiny quiet

84
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.100
in this case, we have to advance the simulation 1000000th of a second at a time.

85
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.030
The reason for this is that bones have an extremely high stiffness,

86
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.230
which makes this method much less efficient. And of course, you know, the drill,

87
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.880
two more papers down the line,

88
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.840
and this may run interactively on a consumer machine at home.

89
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.530
So was the verdict algorithm design,

90
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.600
a plus exposition, a plus quality of presentation,

91
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.200
a double plus. And it's still Mr. Whoppers,

92
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.770
third paper in computer graphics and real.

93
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.540
And we researchers even get paid to create beautiful works like this.

94
00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.350
I also couldn't resist creating a slow motion version of some of these videos.

95
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.360
