<v 0>Dear fellow scholars. This is terminate papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér.</v>

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.040
What you see here is one of my favorite kind of paper, where we train a robot in a software simulation, and then we try to bring it into the real world and see if it can still navigate there. The simulation is the textbook and the real world is the exam. If you will. And it's a really hard one. So let's see if this one passes or fails. Now the real world is messy and full of obstacles. So to even have a fighting chance in training a robot to deal with that, the simulation better has those properties too. So let's add some 

3
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.040
heels

4
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.040
, steps and stairs, and let's see if it can overcome these well. Not at first, as 

5
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.040
you'll

6
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.040
 see, the agent is very clumsy and can barely walk through a simple terrain, but

7
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.873
 as time passes, it grows to be a little more confident.

8
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.453
And with that,

9
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.960
the terrain also progressively becomes more and more difficult in order to

10
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:04.890
maximize learning. That is a great life lesson right there.

11
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.890
Now, while we look at these terrain experiments,

12
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.300
you can start holding onto your papers because this robot knows absolutely

13
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.470
nothing about the outside world. It has no traditional cameras,

14
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.220
no radar, no LIDAR, no depth sensors.

15
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.320
No no-no none of that. Only proprioceptive sensors are allowed,

16
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.420
which means that the only thing that the robot senses is its own internal state.

17
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.780
And that's it. Whoa, for instance,

18
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.620
it knows about its orientation and twist of the base unit,

19
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.370
a little joint information like positions and velocities,

20
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.290
and really not that much more, all of which is proprioceptive information.

21
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.100
Yup. That's it. And [inaudible], it is doing quite well in a

22
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.933
 simulation. However reality is never quite the same as the simulations. So I wonder if what was learned here can be used there. Let's see.

23
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.153
Wow.

24
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.720
Look at how well it traverses through this Rocky mountain stream

25
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.280
and not even this nightmare is slowly descent gives it too much trouble.

26
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:23.630
It works.

27
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.010
Even if it cannot get a proper foothold and it is slipping all the time.

28
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.260
And it also learned to engage in this adorable jumpy behavior when stuck

29
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.220
in vegetation. And it learned all this by itself,

30
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.850
absolute witchcraft. When looking at this table,

31
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.680
we now understand that it still has reasonable speeds through Mars and

32
00:02:45.681 --> 00:02:50.330
why it is lower in vegetation then in mud, really cool.

33
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.610
If you have been holding onto your papers so far now squeeze that paper

34
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.890
because if all that wasn't hard enough,

35
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.040
let's add an 10 kilogram or 22 pound payload and see if it

36
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:06.550
can shoulder it. And let's be honest, NIS should not.

37
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.880
Wow. Look at that. It can not only shoulder it,

38
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.500
but it also adjust.

39
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.240
It's moving to the changes to its own internal physics to accomplish this.

40
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.100
It uses a concept that is called learning by cheating or the

41
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:27.743
teacher-student architecture.

42
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.650
When the agent that learned in the simulator will be the teacher.

43
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.300
Now, after we escaped the simulator into the real world,

44
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.440
we cannot lean on the simulator anymore to try to see what works.

45
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.310
So then what do we do? Well here,

46
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.950
the teacher takes the place of the simulator.

47
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.760
It distills its knowledge down to train the student further.

48
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.790
If both of them do their jobs really well,

49
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.980
and the student were successfully pass the exam with flying colors. As you see,

50
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.840
it is exactly the case here. This is an outrageously good paper.

51
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.730
What a time to be alive.

52
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.200
This episode has been supported by weights and biases in this post.

53
00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.400
They show you how to use their reports to explain how your model works,

54
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.100
show plots of how model versions improved,

55
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.730
discuss bugs and demonstrate progress towards milestones.

56
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.970
If you work with learning algorithms on a regular basis,

57
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.640
make sure to check out weights and biases.
