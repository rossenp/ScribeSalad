00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.920
Friendly greetings to everyone.

2
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.930
My name is Károly Zsolnai and I promise to you that the pronunciation of my name

3
00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:09.790
is going to be the most complicated thing is is

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.120
this piece of work is a collaboration between Activision blizzard,

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.820
the University of Santa Rosa and the Technical University of Vienna.

6
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.520
The quest here was to render images with Reni,

7
00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:27.570
high quality subsurface scattering in the mealtime on commodity hardware.

8
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.650
<v 0>Normally to render photorealistic images,
we populate a scene with objects,</v>

10
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.710
add the camera and the light source and start tracing race from the camera to

11
00:00:39.711 --> 00:00:41.350
determine the income ingredients.

12
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.550
Now even though there is a large volume of research going on on how to do this

13
00:00:46.551 --> 00:00:50.210
efficiently,
this is still a really time consuming process.

14
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.400
What's more this figure here shows light transport only between surfaces,

15
00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.910
meaning that we suppose that rays of light propagate only impact if we extend

16
00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:04.340
our program to support participating media,

17
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.340
we can render a volumetric effects like smoke,

18
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.670
haze and many others and also translucent materials such as skin,

19
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.630
plant,
leaves,
marble wax and so on.

20
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.010
However,

21
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.450
this extension bumps up the dimensionality of the immigrant we need to solve.

22
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.180
Making the process even more time consuming.

23
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.980
<v 1>Okay,</v>

24
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.950
<v 0>but the reward for this is immense.
You're on the left.</v>

25
00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:35.910
You can see how our skin would look like without subsurface scattering.

26
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.040
It is indeed a very important factor in the visual appearance of many

27
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:42.270
translucent materials.

28
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.560
It is not a surprise that the motion picture and the game industries are

29
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:49.080
yearning for a realtime solution for this.

30
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.400
There are fortunately simplified models to render subsurface light transport in

31
00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:56.960
optical take materials.

32
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.440
What we do here is take an infinite Hoff space of a chosen translucent material.

33
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.420
Lighten infinitesimally thin pencil beam from evolve in normal incidence.

34
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.730
This beam will penetrate the surface of the material and you start to attenuate

35
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.590
as it becomes more and more submerged into the media.
During this process,

36
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.750
these forums undergo many scattering events and eventually exit somewhere away

37
00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:24.584
from the origin.

38
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.850
Counting up these photos exiting at different distances.

39
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.300
We can build a histogram that we call diffusion profile and we'll denote as rd.

40
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.110
This is an actual simulated diffusion profile.
What it looks like.

41
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.130
If we look from above.

42
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.370
Another important bit of preliminary knowledge is that we can directly use these

43
00:02:49.371 --> 00:02:53.900
diffusion profiles by come rolling down with an input irradiance map to add

44
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.200
subsurface scattering to it as a prosperous assessing step.

45
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.980
This is how the result looks like after the convolution is applied.

46
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.520
Now this is remarkable as we don't have to run a fully ray trace simulation with

47
00:03:08.641 --> 00:03:11.490
participating in media.
However,

48
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.920
these signals are stored as images,

49
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.390
so normally this means that we compute a two D convolution between them.

50
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.510
Unfortunately,
this is very costly,

51
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.930
but there are techniques to reduce this problem to several much cheaper one.

52
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:30.920
The convolutions
one example is the old excellent technique.

53
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.390
He takes into consideration that in a homogeneous and isotropic medium,

54
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.900
the diffusion profiles are radially symmetric.
Therefore,

55
00:03:38.901 --> 00:03:43.250
it is possible to take a one these slice off this profile as shown below here

56
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.900
and trying to fit it with a some of costumes which are individually also

57
00:03:47.901 --> 00:03:48.860
radially symmetric.

58
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.230
This means that we can use a cheaper set of one de convolutions instead of using

59
00:03:54.231 --> 00:03:55.580
the two d profile directly.

60
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.230
This is an example input signal and the results were Dion's technique,

61
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.670
but different number of costs.
Ian's compared to the true diffusion kernel,

62
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.010
it is important to point out that even the mathematical properties of costumes,

63
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.140
this technique requires one horizontal and one vertical convolution for Garcia.

64
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.540
These are one the convolutions.

65
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.820
This also means that if we'd like to obtain high quality subsurface scattering,

66
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.450
we need at least four Gaussians and therefore eight convolutions.

67
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.490
This is not suitable for most real time applications.
However,

68
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.550
it is a really smart idea and it hasn't been really improved since 2007 and

69
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.940
honestly,
when we started this project,

70
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.960
we didn't think anyone could realistically come up with something that's better

71
00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:44.794
than this.

72
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.710
Our quest wasn't nonetheless to obtain high fidelity results with a separable

73
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.580
kernel using only two convulsions,
which is marked with green up there.

74
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.880
<v 1>Okay.</v>

75
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.670
<v 0>This utilizing the Svd of the diffusion profile,</v>

76
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.490
it is clear that the signal is not separable.

77
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.990
It is not possible to write this to the function as a mere product of one d

78
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.910
functions.
However,

79
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.100
the seminar plot tells us that the higher rank singular values decay came

80
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:16.400
rapidly.
Meaning that most of the information here is not random.

81
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.010
It has a lot of structure.
Therefore,

82
00:05:19.011 --> 00:05:21.890
a rank one approximation sounds like a good starting point.

83
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.510
The plan was to treat the diffusion profile here on the right as a matrix for

84
00:05:27.511 --> 00:05:28.880
which we compute DSPD.

85
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.450
Here you can see the one singular value that we're taking and the corresponding

86
00:05:33.451 --> 00:05:37.170
left and right singular vectors that we hear the note by a,

87
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.560
we don't compute one horizontal and one vertical convolution using these

88
00:05:42.561 --> 00:05:46.180
singular vectors to reconstruct the diffusion kernel and obtain the,

89
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.670
this is the input and the rank one SVD reconstruction.

90
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.090
This will be the ground truth and now we can see that the separable svd

91
00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:01.490
approximation is indeed looking very grim.

92
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.870
There is a world of a difference between the two,
so wow,

93
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.820
this is surprising,

94
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.680
especially considering the fact that the Eckhart Young CRM teaches us that the

95
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:17.300
SPD is the best reconstruction in terms of different venues,
norm,

96
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.760
which corresponds here to the RMS error.

97
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.300
This is the absolute best reconstruction we can obtain with respect to the RMS

98
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:29.930
error.
Very disappointing.
Yeah.

99
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.760
Algorithm.
The one with the one the slice and fitting with one golf seeum.

100
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:40.340
This means the same amount of convolutions and hence the same execution time as

101
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:43.580
the rank one svd and the ground truth.

102
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.420
This is how the SVD looks like on the real world seem compared to using the true

103
00:06:50.421 --> 00:06:51.254
kernel.

104
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.120
Looking at it again in our disappointment,

105
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.170
we noticed that the SVD overall darker image.

106
00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.260
Therefore the reconstruction is not energy conserving.

107
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:04.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

108
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.750
<v 0>A new idea came up.</v>

109
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.370
Maybe we would try this before putting the project on ice and calling it today.

110
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.380
What if we would solve a minimization problem where the reconstructed colonel

111
00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:18.770
would still be as close as possible to the diffuse and profile,

112
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.350
but would also be energy conservant.

113
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:27.010
This should definitely be a viable option and the results are dreadful.

114
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.350
Horrendous.
I just,
I just don't know what to say.

115
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.720
Look at the nose somehow as if the input,

116
00:07:34.721 --> 00:07:39.721
the radiance signal showed up as I'm really nasty ringing artifact and we had

117
00:07:39.811 --> 00:07:41.040
the same around the ear.

118
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.600
Visualize the actual kernel on a disk of light to see what went wrong here.

119
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:48.520
And yes,

120
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.870
we see that it is indeed traps for nothing like the simulated difference in

121
00:07:52.871 --> 00:07:57.600
kernel,
but we hadn't the slightest idea why this happened.

122
00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.170
Visualizing the kernel itself in a simple one,

123
00:08:01.171 --> 00:08:03.780
the plot and staring at it for a while.

124
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:09.260
It looks like the great separable approximation with respect to the RMS are most

125
00:08:09.961 --> 00:08:14.760
of the energy of the signal is close to the origin and the optimized and tries

126
00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:17.820
to reconstruct these details as closely as possible.

127
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.150
Please note that the colonel plots are deceiving.

128
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.390
These signals indeed have the same amount of energy,

129
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.110
but the tail of the fish is extending or really far away,

130
00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:31.470
and this makes up for the seemingly less energy of the signal.

131
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:36.510
This very delicate thing took a week of my life and I kind of want it back.

132
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.150
So what if we would minimize not only the RMS terror by itself,

133
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:46.560
which of course is the optimizer to concentrate the energy to the origin of the

134
00:08:46.561 --> 00:08:48.690
signal where the energy spike is,

135
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:53.790
but we would add a guide function which behaves like an envelope that tells the

136
00:08:53.791 --> 00:08:58.350
optimizer to possibly because struck the regions not close to the origin.

137
00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.470
Let's focus a bit more on foreign scattering.

138
00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:07.890
This is the originally had and this is a very simple distance weighted guide

139
00:09:08.441 --> 00:09:09.550
function.
I had in mind

140
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:16.150
imagined that we now have a more general model for which we used k equals zero.

141
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.180
That constant envelope to obtain these horrendous results.

142
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:26.240
I will now tell the optimizer to use k equals one which means that we would give

143
00:09:26.241 --> 00:09:29.210
higher waist to the regions first or away from the origin.

144
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.060
This is what we obtained,
very intuitive.

145
00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:39.040
We have a signal with the same amount of energy as if we pushed it from the top

146
00:09:39.041 --> 00:09:43.600
to neglect the origin and add this energy to the tail of the signal to focus on

147
00:09:43.601 --> 00:09:45.730
the reconstruction of firing,
scattering.

148
00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.910
And now we can even go take was too,

149
00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:53.680
which is essentially squishing the signal a bit more to emphasize foreign

150
00:09:53.681 --> 00:09:57.700
scattering at the price of neglecting sharp close range details.

151
00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:59.400
<v 1>Okay,</v>

152
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.630
<v 0>back to the original fit.</v>

153
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:05.970
Let's wait it by distance a bit by plugging cake was one in the optimizer

154
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.720
almost there.
Okay,
let's go.

155
00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:13.380
Cake was a bit more emphasis on foreign scattering.

156
00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.940
Now this looks remarkably close to the ground truth.

157
00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:23.200
This is the journey behind the guided optimization technique that is separable,

158
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:28.090
requires only two convolutions and is one of the techniques we propose for

159
00:10:28.091 --> 00:10:31.180
applications,
real time,
time constraints.

160
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:37.110
We also propose an other technique which we have mathematically derived and for

161
00:10:37.271 --> 00:10:40.300
which I admit not having an intuitive story.

162
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.450
So before I dare showing you the next slide,

163
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.450
take a big breath and let's go.

164
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.250
So sorry,
this is solid.

165
00:10:50.251 --> 00:10:55.251
It looks like and what is remarkable about it that this follows a completely

166
00:10:55.831 --> 00:10:56.820
different paradigm.

167
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:01.770
What they're aiming for here is not to make our kernel closer to the original

168
00:11:01.771 --> 00:11:02.790
diffusion kernel,

169
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.020
but trying to make the results of the commotion the same.

170
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.420
It is almost like minimizing the alto distance of the resulting convolved
images,

171
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:17.490
not the colonel stem cells staining for images,
not kernels.

172
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:23.100
This is impossible to solve for a general case,
so in order to accomplish this,

173
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:27.510
one needs to confine the solution to a class of empathy.
Radiance signals,

174
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:32.100
input images,
right,
would work well in our derivation.

175
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:34.440
We plugged in one day signals as inputs.

176
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.850
This means that the technique should behave analytically on signals like this

177
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.480
and the most remarkable thing that this is a mere rank,

178
00:11:43.481 --> 00:11:48.481
one separable approximation that is really analitics for this class of signals.

179
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.200
This means that it mimics the effects of the true kernel perfectly.

180
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.720
Let's take a look at this on a practical case.
Of course,
not all signals are one.

181
00:11:58.721 --> 00:11:59.554
The signals,

182
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.830
this is our result with the analytic preintegrated kernel and the ground truth

183
00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:12.290
very close to being indistinguishable.
Furthermore,

184
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:17.270
it is really simple to implement and it has a closed form solution that does not

185
00:12:17.271 --> 00:12:19.970
require any kind of optimization procedure.

186
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.020
One more interesting detail for the more curious minds.

187
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:29.360
This technique is for a greater class and only one these signals a class that we

188
00:12:29.361 --> 00:12:31.730
call additively separable signals.

189
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:33.030
<v 1>Okay,</v>

190
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:37.080
<v 0>so what about artistic editing?
The paint integrated technique is great,</v>

191
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:40.590
but it does not offer any kind of artistic control over the output.

192
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.250
The guided approximation requires optimization,

193
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:49.700
but in return it also offers some degree of artistic freedom on how the desired

194
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.150
output should look like.

195
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:52.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

196
00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.630
<v 0>We also have this technique which is simply using two separable Gaussians of</v>

197
00:12:56.631 --> 00:12:58.010
different variants values,

198
00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:02.540
one each to provide perfect artistic freedom in adjusting the magnitudes of

199
00:13:02.541 --> 00:13:04.250
clothes and foreign scattering.

200
00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:09.680
Note that these two godsons are not the same as Indians approach with a two

201
00:13:09.681 --> 00:13:14.150
Gaussians as we don't use the radially symmetric one,
the signal directly.

202
00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:15.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>

203
00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:16.670
<v 0>A real world example.</v>

204
00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:22.240
This is the input irradiance heavily saturated barring scattering.

205
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:23.383
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

206
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.680
<v 0>have an exaggerated close range scattering and the moral conservative.</v>

207
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:33.040
Really good looking mixture of the two.
Wrapping it up.

208
00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:38.440
DSPD is great for applications that can afford higher rank reconstructions.

209
00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:43.750
The colonel integration is a simple technique that is analitics for additively

210
00:13:43.751 --> 00:13:47.830
separable signals,
guided optimization,

211
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:52.140
or more general version of the paint degration that can be conveniently today

212
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.470
with one parameter.

213
00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:54.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

214
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.350
<v 0>Manual approximation,
many degrees of freedom for artists.</v>

215
00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:03.420
While it has a quite reasonable accuracy that is comparable to forgo osteons

216
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.770
with previous techniques,

217
00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.780
different techniques with different levels of scientific rigor and different

218
00:14:10.781 --> 00:14:11.860
target audiences.

219
00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:16.030
Arranging from scientists to artists working in the industry.

220
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.890
Now,
even though we used examples with skin to demonstrate our techniques,

221
00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:26.330
it is important to point out that they work for a variety of translucent media

222
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.840
such as plants,
marble,

223
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.553
<v 1>okay.</v>

224
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.320
<v 0>In his still life
and milk.</v>

225
00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.940
The most important take home message from this project,
at least for me,

226
00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.830
is that it's entirely possible to do academic research together with companies

227
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:50.240
and create results that can make it to multimillion dollars computer games,

228
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:54.710
but also having proven results that are useful for the scientific community.

229
00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.280
<v 1>Thank you.</v>
