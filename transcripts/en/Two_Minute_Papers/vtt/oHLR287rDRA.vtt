00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.110
<v 0>Dear fellow scholars. This is terminate papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér.</v>

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.210
I think this might be it.

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.220
This paper is called Monte-Carlo geometry processing. And in my opinion,

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.870
this may be one of the best,

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.990
if not the best computer graphics paper of the year,

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.630
there will be so many amazing results.

7
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.440
I first thought this one paper could be the topic of 10,

8
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.730
two minute papers videos,

9
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.270
but I will attempt to cram everything into this one video.

10
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.810
It is quite challenging to explain. So please bear with me.

11
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.760
I try my best to even have a fighting chance at understanding what is going on

12
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:36.810
here. First,

13
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.770
we start out with one of the most beautiful topics in computer graphics,

14
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.840
which is none other than light transport to create a beautiful light simulation.

15
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.280
We have to solve something that we call the rendering equation for practical

16
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:53.160
cases. It is currently impossible to solve it.

17
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.880
Like we usually solve any other equation. However,

18
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.740
what we can do is that we can choose a random re simulate its path as it

19
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:06.300
bounces around in the scene and compute how it interacts with the objects and

20
00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:09.960
materials within the scene. As we do it with more and mores,

21
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.040
we get more information about what we see in the scene. That's good,

22
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.070
but look, it is noisy.

23
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.500
As we add even more res this noise slowly evens out. And in the end,

24
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.510
we get a perfectly clean image.

25
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.500
This takes place with the help of the technique that we call Monte-Carlo

26
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:29.334
integration,

27
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.140
which involves her randomness at the risk of oversimplifying the situation.

28
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.950
In essence, this technique says that we cannot solve the problem,

29
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.900
but we can take samples from the problem. And if we do it in a smart way,

30
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.830
eventually we will be able to solve it in light transport.

31
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.400
The problem is the rendering equation, which we cannot solve,

32
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.080
but we can take samples. One sample is simulating one, Ray,

33
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.400
if we have enough phrase, we have a solution. However,

34
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.660
it hasn't always been like this before. Monte-Carlo integration,

35
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.230
light transport was done through a technique called radiopacity.

36
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.970
The key issue with radiopacity was that the geometry of the scene had to be

37
00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:14.250
sliced up into many small pieces.

38
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.960
And the light scattering events had to be evaluated between these small pieces.

39
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.310
It could not handle all light transport phenomenon and the geometry processing

40
00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:24.930
part was a major headache.

41
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.180
And Monte-Carlo integration was a revelation that breathe new life into

42
00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:31.770
this field. However,

43
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.970
there are still many geometry processing problems that include these headaches

44
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.710
and hold onto your papers because this paper shows us that we can apply.

45
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.360
Monte-Carlo integration to many of these problems to, for instance,

46
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.520
one, it can resolve the rich,

47
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.260
external and internal structure of this end with traditional techniques.

48
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.760
This will normally take more than 14 hours and 30 gigabytes of memory.

49
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.460
But if we apply Monte-Carlo integration to this problem,

50
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.170
we can get a somewhat noisy preview of the result in less than one minute.

51
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.740
Of course, over time, as we compute more samples,

52
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.540
the noise clears up and we get this beautiful final result

53
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.430
and the concept can be used for so much more. It truly makes my head spin.

54
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.320
Let's discuss six amazing applications while noting that there are so many more

55
00:03:23.321 --> 00:03:27.610
in the paper, which you can and should check out in the video description.

56
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.350
For instance, too,

57
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.390
it can also compute a CT scan of the infamous shovel nose frog that you

58
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:38.440
see here. And instead of creating the full 3d solution,

59
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.090
we only have to compute a 2d slice of it, which is much, much cheaper.

60
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:45.640
Three.

61
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.170
It can also edit these curves and note that the key part is that we can do that

62
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:53.890
without the major headache of creating an intermediate triangle,

63
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:58.780
mass geometry for it, for it also supports denoising techniques.

64
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.220
So we don't have to compute too many samples to get a clear image or piece of

65
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:07.030
geometry, five performing Kamholtz Hodge.

66
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.910
The composition with this method is also possible.

67
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.350
This is a technique that is used widely in many domains. For instance,

68
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.000
it is responsible to ensure the stability of many fluid simulation programs.

69
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.900
And this technique can also produce these decompositions.

70
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.550
And interestingly,

71
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.770
here it is used to represent 3d objects without the usual triangle mashes

72
00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:32.800
that we use in computer graphics sakes.

73
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.740
It supports multiple important sampling as well.

74
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.830
This means that if we have multiple sampling strategies,

75
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.060
multiple ways to solve a problem that have different advantages and

76
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:47.500
disadvantages, it combines them in a way that we get the best of all of them.

77
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.130
We had a mega episode on multiple important sampling.

78
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.880
It has lots of amazing users in light transport simulations.

79
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.830
So if you would like to hear more,

80
00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.190
make sure to check that out in the video description, but wait,

81
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.410
these are all difficult problems.

82
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.690
One surely needs a PhD and years of experience in computer graphics to implement

83
00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:12.040
this right, when seeing a work like this, we often ask, okay,

84
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.370
it does something great, but how complex is it?

85
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.930
How many days do I have to work to reimplement it? Please take a guess.

86
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.630
And let me know what the guest was in the comments section.

87
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.210
And now what you see here is none other than the source code for the core of the

88
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:31.090
method. And what's even more,

89
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.880
a bunch of implementations of it already exists.

90
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.860
And if you see that the paper has been re implemented around day one, you know,

91
00:05:38.861 --> 00:05:39.580
it's good.

92
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.320
So no wonder this paper has been accepted to SIGGRAPH perhaps the most

93
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:46.180
prestigious computer graphics conference.

94
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.480
It is immensely difficult to get a paper accepted there.

95
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.150
And I would say this one more than earned it.

96
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.410
Huge congratulations to the first author of the paper, RO Han Sawhney.

97
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.160
He is a PhD student and note that this was his second published

98
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:02.750
paper and a real,

99
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.410
such a great leap for the field in just one paper.

100
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.360
Also congratulations to professor Kean and crane who advised this project and

101
00:06:11.361 --> 00:06:13.790
many other wonderful works in the last few years,

102
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.910
I cannot wait to see what they will be up to next.

103
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.820
