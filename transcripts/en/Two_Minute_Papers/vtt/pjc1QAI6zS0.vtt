WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.290
We are going to start with the most difficult thing in the entire semester.

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.250
It's about how to pronounce my name.
Okay.

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.390
All right.

4
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.350
Okay.
Uh,
so,
uh,

5
00:00:22.351 --> 00:00:27.351
I am from Hungary and this is pronounced as Károly Zsolnai. Károly is essentially the

6
00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:31.410
equivalent of Karl in,

7
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.490
in Deutsche or Charles in English and Zsolnai [inaudible].

8
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.860
There's low to for that spoke,
so I'm sorry.
So it is pronounced as coward.

9
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.980
If you imagined this as like an English word that in,

10
00:00:43.981 --> 00:00:48.600
forget the l and you just pronounce it like that.
So it's Katori.
Okay.

11
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.390
So,
uh,
I'd like to hear some examples.
So Calorie.

12
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.580
Okay.
Yes,
yes.

13
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.330
Excellent.
That'd be louder.

14
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.630
[inaudible]
so he's kind of way,
so it's,
it's all,

15
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:11.340
it's like a y style.
One more time.
Louder.

16
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.090
Yes.
Excellent.
Okay.

17
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.800
Wow.
It's amazing.
Okay.

18
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.180
Now comes the hard parts.
So this is pronounced as Joel night.

19
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.530
Okay.

20
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.240
So all it's Hungarian is a weird language whereZ and s is actually one letter.

21
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.410
So if you take a look at the Hungarian alphabet,
there's a letter that is z.

22
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.300
There's a letter that is s and there's a third letter that is zen as together.

23
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.500
So [inaudible] so this is pronounced as you show them.

24
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.550
So the h is the difficult part.
Okay.
There's all night.

25
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.620
Wow.
Yes

26
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.920
I can.
Can you pronounce it

27
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.400
immediately?
Nailing.
Okay.
Yes.

28
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.360
Yes.
It showed val,
it was are,
are you,
are you Hungarian

29
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.760
as parents?
Maybe.
Secretly.

30
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.130
Wow.
That's great.
Sure.
It's not sure.

31
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.560
Jordan.
Jordan is June.
Okay.

32
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.580
Is there someone who I have forgotten or everyone,
everyone knows what's up.
Okay,

33
00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.950
so this is what we're going to be doing.

34
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.920
So the amazing thing is that when you see images on the internet like that,

35
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.520
sometimes it's difficult to find out if this is,

36
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.060
if it is computer graphics or is it a real photograph.

37
00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:54.950
And this is one of these examples.
This is an an uh,

38
00:02:54.951 --> 00:02:56.940
an example.
Uh,

39
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.750
and this is the work of amazing engineers and amazing artists.

40
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.410
And we are going to be talking about how to compute images like that.

41
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.130
And if you look at this,
well when you download the slides at home,

42
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:16.240
you will see that on the lens,
the dust is modeled here.

43
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:18.790
You can see just some small splotches,

44
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:23.350
but you can actually see pieces of dust on the lens of the camera.

45
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.380
And this is computed with the computer program and by the end of the semester

46
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.280
you are going to know everything about this.
How is this exactly computed?

47
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.590
Every single pixel,
uh,

48
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.040
just a few,
uh,
thanks of all the organization,
there's gonna be assignments,

49
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.850
they take up 40% of your grade and these assignments we'll have,

50
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.120
uh,

51
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.410
most of them will have the theoretical parts and on paper I'll do under how to

52
00:03:53.411 --> 00:03:57.900
understand what's going on,
uh,
in nature.
And there will be,

53
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.070
there will be also programming exercises,

54
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:04.420
but they are not really that programming exercises.
It's,

55
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.270
it's mostly using programs,

56
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.720
understanding what they are doing and maybe modifying them here and there.

57
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.060
But you are not going to write my huge rendering engines and things like that.

58
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:20.090
So,
uh,
don't worry about this.
Uh,

59
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.990
does 60% part is uh,

60
00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:26.920
an oral exam and this is going to take place after the semester,
uh,

61
00:04:26.921 --> 00:04:28.790
with me.
So this is,
uh,

62
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.010
some friendly discussion about what you have learned or a not so friendly

63
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:36.760
discussion if you haven't learned anything,
that's never been the case.

64
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:41.140
So I'm just getting a,
and this is going to take place within,

65
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.700
but you can choose.
So

66
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.040
if you would like to have the exam with Thomas,
that's also fine.

67
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:53.041
But I would like to note that I am an engineer and he's a brilliant physicist.

68
00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:58.210
So if you choose,
you know who to,
who to try to deal with.

69
00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.860
I choose the engineer.
I don't know about you,
but

70
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.653
it's just,

71
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.670
just a suggestion and there can be some kind of individual contribution.

72
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.850
So if you find some errors on the slides,

73
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.060
if you add some figures that hey,
I don't like this figure,

74
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:18.330
I've drawn something better than that.

75
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.160
There's going to be programs that we work with.

76
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.670
If you find some parts in there or if you can extend it in any way,

77
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.870
you can get plus points.

78
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.640
And this applies to basically any kind of contribution that you have.
A,

79
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.550
this is the book that we're gonna learn from.
So there is a,

80
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.520
I'm trying to cover everything and at some point I will say that,
yeah,

81
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.130
please open the book if you would like to know more about this.
But,
uh,

82
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.260
whatever I tell you here is going to be enough for a exam.

83
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.170
So it's not going to happen as,
hey,
why haven't you read,
I don't know,

84
00:05:52.171 --> 00:05:56.830
a patient,
he kind of a 59,
don't you remember that?
This is not going to happen.

85
00:05:56.831 --> 00:05:58.670
So this is to augment your knowledge.

86
00:05:58.671 --> 00:06:02.660
If you would like to move more and this is a great place to do and this has a

87
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:05.270
website,
this can be bought at different places.

88
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.150
There is some sample chapters and
uh,

89
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.370
before buying you can take a look whether you like it enough or not.

90
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.620
So it's pretty cool that it has sample chapters.
Uh,

91
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.300
let's start with what you shouldn't expect from this course.

92
00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:27.140
I'll just run through it and there's not going to be rigorous derivations of

93
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:29.300
every imaginable equation that you have.

94
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.540
So there are courses where there is this neverending infinite loop like in

95
00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:39.860
programming in an infinite loop off definition,

96
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.740
CRM corrolary definition,
theory and theory.
M lemme uh,

97
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.530
raise your hand if yes,
she was being taught a course like that.

98
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.580
I'm not gonna tell anyone.
Okay,
so I'm not going to,

99
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.670
so I've had a lot of these courses and I've,
I've had enough so,
so I'm,

100
00:06:56.671 --> 00:07:01.410
I'm trying to do it differently.
There's not going to be,
unless,
uh,

101
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:02.583
derivations,

102
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.030
there's not going to be an under stream of formula as well without explanation.

103
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.230
There's going to be formulaic,

104
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.250
but with explanations we are going to play with all of them and you are going to

105
00:07:12.251 --> 00:07:16.870
understand that the core meaning right,
these things.
And uh,

106
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.360
at the same time,

107
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:23.190
please don't expect to understand everything.
If you open,

108
00:07:23.191 --> 00:07:26.520
for instance,
the Lux render,
a source called,

109
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.800
this is like a half a million line of code,
a project,

110
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.700
one of the best vendors out there.
But there's many,
many really good renders.

111
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.670
You will not understand every single thing that is there.

112
00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:43.910
But you will understand how the light transport part works as early as possible.

113
00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.950
And the most important thing I've,

114
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.530
I've put it there with bolts because this is what students love.

115
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.710
You don't have to memorize any of the formula.
Okay?

116
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.190
So I will never tell you that.
Okay,

117
00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.290
give me this formula and he will have to remember it off the top of your head.

118
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.290
I don't care.
I mean if you're an engineer at a company,
you sit down,

119
00:08:07.291 --> 00:08:10.200
you need to solve a problem.
If you don't remember something,
what do you do?

120
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.440
Google and Youtube for it.
This is,

121
00:08:13.441 --> 00:08:17.400
it's not important to remember things.
It's important to understand this.

122
00:08:17.401 --> 00:08:22.040
So if you look at the formula,
you will have to understand what is going on.
Uh,

123
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.250
and that's intuition.

124
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:28.500
This is what I would like you to have as much as possible,

125
00:08:28.501 --> 00:08:30.480
but you don't need to memorize any of these.

126
00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:35.990
Now what you should expect from this course is how to simulate light in a simple

127
00:08:37.111 --> 00:08:38.400
and elegant way.

128
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.910
This is going to be a surprise at first because things are going to look

129
00:08:41.911 --> 00:08:45.690
complicated and by the end we are going to derive,

130
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:50.810
do really simple solutions for that that can be implemented in 200 lines of c

131
00:08:50.971 --> 00:08:51.804
plus plus.

132
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.100
So this 200 lance can compute something that's almost beautiful as what you have

133
00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:56.934
seen here.

134
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:02.150
And I have written this piece of code and every theory that we uh,

135
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.880
learn about you are going to see them in code in in fact there's going to be an

136
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:10.470
entire lecture on a code review.

137
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:16.070
Like let's go through this render and see there is slicks approximation,

138
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.310
there is not as low dose,

139
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.260
this and that and every single thing that you'll learn here you are going to see

140
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:27.220
unicode.
It's,
it's not just a flying out the window enough.

141
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:31.890
You will know why nature looks like as it does in real life.

142
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:36.570
And you won't be wondering that there's the so many beautiful things and why

143
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:39.540
have a pi seeing them the way they are.

144
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.580
Why are they looking at the way they are?

145
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:48.210
And you will know about also most of the state of the art in global
illumination.

146
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.920
This means that yes,

147
00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:53.400
we will start with algorithms from 1968

148
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.280
and we will end with algorithms from uh,

149
00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:03.570
this year right from two weeks ago or in the next few weeks because the siggraph

150
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:07.760
is coming like the cigarette papers,
the biggest conference with them,
that stuff.

151
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:11.820
The bunch is coming in the next few weeks and I'm going to read through it and

152
00:10:11.821 --> 00:10:15.540
the materials will be updated to the very latest works.

153
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:21.670
And another thing is that a really important,
uh,

154
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:26.780
is that you will be able to visualize and understand complicated formula in a

155
00:10:27.121 --> 00:10:28.410
really intuitive way.

156
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:32.970
So I would like you to learn something that's not only light transport specific,

157
00:10:32.971 --> 00:10:37.020
but you will be able to use this knowledge wherever you go,

158
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.800
whatever kind of a mathematical problems you have.

159
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:46.040
This knowledge will be useful and we will see from the very first lecture and

160
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.830
the most important thing is that you will see the world differently.
There is,

161
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:57.890
there is lots of beautiful things in nature and you won't be able to stop

162
00:10:58.621 --> 00:11:02.020
looking at it.
So you will,
you will perhaps like,
uh,

163
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.920
taking the train or public transport the big more than before because there's,

164
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:10.360
there's so many intricate,
delicate things to see,
uh,

165
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:14.640
that you haven't seen before.
You have looked,
but you haven't seen them before.
