<v 0>The fellow scholars,</v>

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.090
this is two minute papers with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér. This paper fixes

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.890
many common problems when it comes to two-way coupling in fluid simulations.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.060
And of course, the first question is what is two-way coupling?

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.460
It means that here the boxes are allowed to move the smoke and the added

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.680
two way coupling part means that now the smoke is also allowed to blow away

7
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.170
the boxes. What's more,

8
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.240
the vorticies here on the right are even able to suspend the red box in the air

9
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.130
for a few seconds, an excellent demonstration of a beautiful phenomenon.

10
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.533
However,

11
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.610
simulating this effect properly for water simulations and for GUI materials

12
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.960
is a huge challenge. So let's see how traditional methods deal with them.

13
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.590
Experiment. Number one, water bunnies.

14
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.750
And do you see what I am seeing here? Immediacy the magic trick.

15
00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.063
Let's look again.

16
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.350
Observe how much water we are starting with a full bunny worth of water.

17
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.390
And then by the end, we have maybe a quarter of a bunny left.

18
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.003
Oh yes.

19
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.960
We have a substantial amount of numerical dissipation in the simulator that

20
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:20.490
leads to volume loss. Can this be solved somehow? Well,

21
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.140
let's see how this no work deals with us starting with one bunny

22
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.960
and ending it with one bunny. Nice.

23
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.980
Just look at the difference of the volume of water left with the new method

24
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.790
compared to the previous one night and day difference.

25
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.210
And this was not even the worst volume loss I've seen.

26
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.470
Make sure to hold onto your papers and check out this one.

27
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.810
Experiment. Number two,

28
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.570
gooey dragons and balls when using a traditional technique, Whoa,

29
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.740
this guy is gone. And when we try a different method,

30
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.640
it does this my goodness.

31
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.420
So let's see if the new method can deal with this case.

32
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:13.650
Oh yes, yes it can. And now onwards to experiment.

33
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.573
Number three,

34
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.960
if you think that research is about throwing things at the wall and seeing what

35
00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:22.560
sticks in the case of the scene, you are not wrong.

36
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.120
So what should happen here, given these materials? Well,

37
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.960
the bunny should stick to the goal and not fall too quickly.

38
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.320
Hmm. None of which happens here.

39
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.770
The previous method does not seem late viscosity properly.

40
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.520
And hence this artificial mounting phenomenon emerges.

41
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.530
I wonder if the new method can do this too. And

42
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.073
yes,

43
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.610
they stick together and the Google correctly slows down the fall of the bunny.

44
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.410
So how does this magic work? Normally in these simulations,

45
00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:03.310
we have to compute pressure viscosity and frictional contact separately,

46
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.290
which are three different tasks.

47
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.790
The technique described in the paper is called monolith because it has a

48
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:13.720
monolithic pressure viscosity contact solver. Yes.

49
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.290
This means that he does all three of these tasks in one goal,

50
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.530
which is mathematically a tiny bit more involved,

51
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.750
but it gives us a proper simulator where water and Google can interact

52
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.980
with solids, no volume loss, no artificial melting,

53
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.510
no crazy jumpy behavior. And here comes the punchline.

54
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.490
I was thinking that, all right,

55
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.940
the more accurate simulator that is always welcome,

56
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.520
but what is the price of this accuracy?

57
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.770
How much longer do I have to wait if you have been holding onto your papers

58
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.970
now squeeze that paper because this technique is not slower,

59
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.200
but up to 10 times faster than previous methods.

60
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.550
And that's where I fell off the chair. When reading this paper and with this,

61
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.140
I hope that we will be able to Marvel at even more delightful, two way,

62
00:04:05.141 --> 00:04:09.070
couple of simulations in the near future. What a time to be alive.
