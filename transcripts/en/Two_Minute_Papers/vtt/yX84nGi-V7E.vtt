00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.170
<v 0>Dear fellow scholars.</v>

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.910
This is two minute papers with Dr. [inaudible] it's time for some fluid

3
00:00:05.911 --> 00:00:06.870
simulations. Again,

4
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.160
writing fluid simulations is one of the most fun things we can do within

5
00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:14.160
computer graphics, because we can create a virtual scene,

6
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.860
add the laws of physics for fluid motion and create photorealistic footage with

7
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:24.720
an absolutely incredible amount of detail and realism note that we can

8
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:27.960
do this ourselves so much. So that for this scene,

9
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.880
I ran the fluid and light simulation myself here at the two minute papers studio

10
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.740
and on consumer hardware. However, despite this amazing looking footage,

11
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.810
we are not nearly done yet. They still so much to explore. For instance,

12
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.800
a big challenge. These days is trying to simulate fluid, solid interactions.

13
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.460
This means that the sand is allowed to have an effect on the fluid,

14
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.700
but at the same time, as the fluid sloshes around,

15
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.280
it also moves the sand particles within.

16
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.130
This is what we refer to as two way coupling.

17
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.630
We also know that there are different kinds of two-way coupling and only the

18
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:08.100
more advanced ones can correctly simulate how real honey supports the deeper.

19
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.170
And there is barely any movement.

20
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.530
This may be about the only place on the internet,

21
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.850
where we are super happy that nothing at all is happening. However,

22
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.900
many of you as would fellow scholars immediately ask, okay,

23
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.250
but what kind of honey are we talking about? We can buy tens,

24
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.370
if not hundreds of different kinds of honey at the market.

25
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.610
If we don't know what kind of honey we are using,

26
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.020
how do we know if the simulation is too viscous or not? Viscous enough?

27
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.710
Great question. Just to make sure we don't get lost.

28
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.450
Viscosity means the amount of resistance against defamation. Therefore,

29
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.290
as we go up, you can witness this kind of resistance increasing,

30
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.600
and now hold onto your papers because this new technique comes from the same

31
00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:59.520
authors as the previous one with the honey dipper and enables us to import real

32
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:03.900
world honey into our simulation. That sounds like science fiction,

33
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.830
importing real world materials into a computer simulation.

34
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.270
How is that even possible? Well, with this solution,

35
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.370
all we need to do is point a consumer smartphone camera at the phenomenon and

36
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.623
record it.

37
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.830
The proposed technique does all the heavy lifting by first extracting the

38
00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:27.420
silhouette of the footage and then creating a simulation that tries to

39
00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:32.340
reproduce this behavior. The closer it is, the better. However,

40
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.840
at first of course,

41
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.980
we don't know the exact parameters that would result in this. However,

42
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.290
now we have an objective we can work towards the goal is to rerun the simulation

43
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.370
with different parameters sets in a way to minimize the difference between the

44
00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:49.500
simulation and reality.

45
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.590
This is not just working by trial and error,

46
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.970
but through a technique that we refer to as mathematical optimization,

47
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.070
as you see later,

48
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.640
the technique was able to successfully identify the appropriate viscosity

49
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:04.474
parameter.

50
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.190
And when evaluating these results note that this work does not deal with how

51
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:11.200
things look for instance,

52
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.030
whether the honey has the proper color or translucency is not the point here.

53
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.010
What we are trying to reproduce is not how it looks, but how it moves.

54
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.950
It works on a variety of different fluid types.

55
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.140
I have slowed down some of these videos to make sure we can appreciate together

56
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.840
how amazingly good these estimations are.

57
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.650
And we are not even done yet. If we wish to,

58
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.210
we can even set up a similar scene as the real world. One with our simulation,

59
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:44.740
as a proxy for the real honey or caramel flow. After that,

60
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.070
we can perform anything we want with this virtual piece of fluid,

61
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.420
even including putting it into novel scenarios like this scene,

62
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.860
which would otherwise be very difficult to control and quite wasteful,

63
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.880
or even creating the perfect honey deeper experiment.

64
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.280
Look at how perfect the symmetry is there down below yum.

65
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.400
Normally in a real-world environment,

66
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.470
we cannot pour the honey and apply forces this accurately, but in a simulation,

67
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.150
we can do anything we want.

68
00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.190
And now we can also import the exact kind of materials for my real world.

69
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.580
Repertoire. If you can buy it, you can simulate it.

70
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.440
What a time to be alive.

71
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.060
This episode has been supported by Linode Linode is the world's largest

72
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.470
independent cloud computing provider. Unlike entry level hosting services,

73
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.410
Linode gives you full backend access to your server,

74
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.450
which is a step up to powerful, fast, fully configurable cloud computing.

75
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.310
Linode also has one click apps that streamline your ability to deploy websites,

76

personal VPNs, game servers, and more,

77
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.780
if you need something as small as a personal online portfolio,

78
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.333
Linode has your back.

79
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.780
And if you need to manage tons of clients' websites and reliably serve them to

80
00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:05.500
millions of visitors, Linux can do that too. What's more,

81
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.300
they offer affordable GPU instances featuring the Quadro RTX

6,000,

83
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.090
which is tailor made for AI scientific computing and computer graphics projects.

84
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.320
