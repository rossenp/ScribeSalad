00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:04.910
<v 0>Tell me.</v>

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.690
<v 1>Who hasn't ever dreamed of a cruise around the Greek islands stopping by my</v>

3
00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:13.310
clonus Santa rainy roads or the more than 1000 islands that Greece has spread

4
00:00:13.311 --> 00:00:14.120
throughout the Aegean.

5
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.440
We are almost talking about a paradise about the Holy grail of the pre COVID

6
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.880
tourist who could resist such a journey. I can only think of one such person,

7
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.350
Recep, Tayyip, Erdogan.

8
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.800
I'm really sorry if I got that pronunciation completely wrong friends.

9
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.670
These hundreds of Greek islands in the GNC have become a nightmare for the

10
00:00:31.671 --> 00:00:35.660
Turkish president's plans. And in Athens, they are perfectly aware of this.

11
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.500
And of course,

12
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.220
after seeing what happened to Jamal Khashoggi and taken to with Liam Neeson,

13
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.520
you know, instant bull is no joking matter, precisely because of this.

14
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.383
In this video,

15
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.270
we are going to look at how Greece is preparing for what may happen.

16
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.700
Are you ready? Well, let's get into it.

17
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:02.660
<v 0>Not long ago.</v>

18
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.000
<v 1>Recent Turkey were in the news because of an earthquake,</v>

19
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.350
but difference visual politics.

20
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.700
The clashes between Ankara and Athens have been beyond seismic since way back.

21
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.420
For example,

22
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.930
the last significant clash has been on the account of what is happening in the

23
00:01:14.931 --> 00:01:18.080
Eastern Mediterranean, where under the sea in the subsoil,

24
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.370
natural gas has been found or raw material that Erdogan is not willing to give

25
00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:24.590
up even a single cubic meter off.

26
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.310
But of course the question is whether or not it is really up to Turkey to

27
00:01:28.311 --> 00:01:30.170
exploit the deposits that have been found.

28
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.830
And the truth is that with so many Greek islands in the way not to mention

29
00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:34.460
Cyprus,

30
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.870
let's see that in principle maritime law does not seem to favor the Ottomans

31
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.770
European union itself has made a subtle defense of the maritime borders of its

32
00:01:42.771 --> 00:01:46.820
members. Something which of course, Erdogan is not prepared to accept for today.

33
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.450
<v 2>2D kit, you do six, seven millimeter currently</v>

34
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.940
[inaudible] on kilometer currently. Other, you said in that

35
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.000
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

36
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.963
[inaudible] [inaudible] Ernie.

37
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.240
<v 1>The Island Ertegun refers to is Castile or it's it's the Eastern most inhabited</v>

38
00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:24.740
Greek islands Idea.

39
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.980
It is situated more than 500 kilometers from the Greek mainland,

40
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.620
but it's barely two kilometers from the Turkish coast.

41
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.930
And even though Ertegun mentions this Island,

42
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.680
the truth is that he could be referring to practically any other because in the

43
00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:41.480
GNC of the more than 100 islands that have been inhabited only to belong to

44
00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:41.960
Turkey,

45
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.950
we are talking about islands that if we read the international maritime law seem

46
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.220
to give Greece of the rights to exploit the resources of the subsoil while

47
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.920
simultaneously excluding their Turkish neighbors,

48
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.280
given this backdrop and knowing what we do know about the Turkish president,

49
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.220
it doesn't seem likely that Erdogan will take this lying down.

50
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.240
Does it well in Athens, they have exactly the same impression.

51
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.780
So they are already getting their act together and preparing for even the worst

52
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:06.700
case scenario, direct confrontation.

53
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.330
Because even though it may seem to us like fiction or a highly improbable

54
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.720
outcome of events, Greece is willing to defend what it considers its own,

55
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.050
but okay, we know that the Turkish army is one of the largest in the world.

56
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.210
So what do we know about the Greek army? Well,

57
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.240
basically that things haven't changed much since qinglian.

58
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.910
<v 0>You see.</v>

59
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.720
<v 1>Arrival of Donald Trump as president of the United States put the NATO demand</v>

60
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.490
that its members reach a military expenditure of 2% of their national GDP back

61
00:03:35.491 --> 00:03:36.120
on the table,

62
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.020
only 10 of the 30 countries in the Atlantic Alliance meet this objective.

63
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.980
And in this ranking,

64
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.670
Greece reaches a surprising second place just behind the United States.

65
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.150
The problem is that Greece is the only country that proportionally spends.

66
00:03:48.151 --> 00:03:50.040
Most of its military spending on paying him.

67
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.173
<v 0>There's an elk.</v>

68
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.800
<v 1>There may only be 300 of those fighters,</v>

69
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.230
but at least they seem to be well-paid these days. Anyway,

70
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.530
what's happening in Greece is very interesting. On the one hand,

71
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.230
it spends its money on its personnel. And on the other hand,

72
00:04:04.231 --> 00:04:08.100
any surplus that it could devote to military equipment is used to defend itself

73
00:04:08.101 --> 00:04:11.910
from Turkey, which happens to be another NATO country. What nonsense.

74
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.500
So why is there so much resentment between Greeks and Turks is Greece prepared

75
00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:19.680
to defend itself from Turkey and perhaps the most important question of all

76
00:04:19.681 --> 00:04:23.190
could the Greek economy cope with the pressure of a possible conflict today?

77
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.260
Visual politic, we will answer these questions,

78
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.360
but first let's take a little look at some history.

79
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.920
<v 0>The treaty of Lou song.</v>

80
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.070
<v 1>There are many things that separate Greece and Turkey, apart from the Aegean.</v>

81
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.860
This is not simply a border between two countries. No,

82
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.030
it's a border that separates two continents, two religions, two civilizations,

83
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.230
East and West,

84
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.730
a frontier afflicted by centuries and centuries of confrontation or border

85
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.810
friends that has been a hotspot since the Trojan war from Alexander.

86
00:04:57.811 --> 00:05:01.620
The great two by Santiam to the Ottoman Turks. In fact,

87
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.370
current problems between Athens and instant ball are due to issues that go back

88
00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:09.870
at least a century in time until just after the first world war or war,

89
00:05:09.871 --> 00:05:12.600
that was a complete disaster for the Ottoman empire.

90
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:13.583
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

91
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.790
<v 1>[Inaudible] in the war. The Salton was ready to accept the treaty of Sephora,</v>

92
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.170
a treaty with concessions,

93
00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:27.060
difficult to digest such as that's part of Anatolia will be occupied by Greece.

94
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.840
For this reason,

95
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.220
Turkish nationalists led by miss stuffer KML Ataturk took up arms and expelled

96
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.840
both the Greeks and the Sultan,

97
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.840
the new Turkish Republic then negotiated a new agreement.

98
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.040
The treaty of Lausanne,

99
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.030
a treaty that meant Greece would give up the Eastern phrase to a Jean islands

100
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.290
off the Dardanelles straits and its interests in Asia minor in return Turkey

101
00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:49.830
renounced his claim to Cyprus and other possible interests in the GNC,

102
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.320
for instance, the islands of the Dodecanese.

103
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.680
Well,

104
00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.140
the fact is that the treaty Lausanne is now almost a hundred years after it was

105
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:03.290
signed the cause of the main tensions between Greece and Turkey today.

106
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.780
And you will see that there are three things that have happened in the

107
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:07.610
intervening years that have upset the agreed.

108
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:13.030
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

109
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.650
<v 1>Again with the Dodecanese islands,</v>

110
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.320
which were Italy's when the treaty of Lausanne was signed,

111
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.890
were handed over to Greece after Italy's defeat in world war II. Secondly,

112
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.460
there are islets that were not expressly mentioned in the treaty of Lausanne,

113
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.090
but that geographically speaking belong to the Dodecanese archipelago,

114
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.120
it is therefore understood that they are Greek, but nevertheless,

115
00:06:31.121 --> 00:06:32.710
the Turks claimed them as their own.

116
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.910
And finally treaty sets the territorial waters for the Aegean islands at three

117
00:06:36.911 --> 00:06:40.840
miles, 4.8 kilometers later, Greece extended them to six miles.

118
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.930
That is 9.6 kilometers with no apparent objection from Turkey,

119
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.170
but what no one could have known then was that by the end of the 20th century,

120
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.010
commonly accepted international law would extend to the territorial waters to 12

121
00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:52.480
miles or 19.3.

122
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:55.840
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

123
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.350
<v 1>Because by then the troops of both countries had already fought in a direct</v>

124
00:06:59.351 --> 00:07:02.230
confrontation. The battleground was the Island of Cyprus,

125
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.530
an independent country where the Greek Cypriot majority rules,

126
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.150
but where there was a notable Turkish community. The fact is that in 1974,

127
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.990
Turkey invaded the Northern third of the Island and established the Turkish

128
00:07:13.991 --> 00:07:15.400
Republic of Northern Cyprus,

129
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.760
which as we have covered in other videos is not internationally recognized.

130
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.080
And if we returned to the Aegean,

131
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:25.000
the most serious clash between Greeks and Turks took place in 1996 on EMEA and

132
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.750
uninhabited Island near the Dota Kenny's archipelago and friends,

133
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.090
the trigger for this conflict is very complex.

134
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.500
<v 0>At Christmas.</v>

135
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.460
<v 1>1995,</v>

136
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:41.050
a Turkish ship ran aground in front of the islet of Emir and refused Greek help

137
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.570
claiming that it was Turkish territory. Weeks later,

138
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.680
a Greek politician came to the Island and planted a Greek flag on it in revenge.

139
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.650
Some Turkish journalists from Turkish newspaper hurry yet,

140
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.100
went to the Island and replaced the flag with a Turkish one. Finally,

141
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.200
Athens sent nine Greek soldiers.

142
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.510
They camped on the Island and replaced the Greek flag,

143
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:02.110
the Greek military presence per half of the Turkish Navy on the warpath and the

144
00:08:02.111 --> 00:08:04.630
Greek soon followed suit. What was about to be declared,

145
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:06.790
but the United States intervened to restore.

146
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:07.953
<v 0>Cool.</v>

147
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.250
<v 1>This point, you might be wondering what on earth,</v>

148
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.540
Greece and Turkey are fighting.

149
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.250
<v 0>About lately? Well,</v>

150
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:18.970
the point is that.

151
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.630
<v 1>Turkey is one of the 20 or so countries that have not signed to the law of the</v>

152
00:08:22.631 --> 00:08:26.410
sea convention. We are talking about the UN treaty signed in Montego Bay,

153
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.880
which has regulated the international law of the sea since 1994, basically.

154
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.900
And Carra does not accept the article in the treaty that States that islands,

155
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.270
as well as the mainland have a continental shelf.

156
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.390
This is very important for the exploitation of economic resources.

157
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.050
Since Anne Cora claims that the Greek islands off the Turkish coast do not have

158
00:08:44.051 --> 00:08:46.510
their own shelf fast. According to this viewpoint,

159
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.320
the zone of Greek influence in the Aegean would begin in continental Greece.

160
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.680
Under the zone of Turkish influence on the sea would not be limited by the Greek

161
00:08:53.681 --> 00:08:57.750
islands bottom line, but gas would belong to the Turks. And on the other hand,

162
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.350
although Turkey accepts the 12 mile limit of territorial waters for all

163
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:02.010
countries.

164
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.670
It makes an exception for Greece and take notes because the issue of these 12

165
00:09:05.671 --> 00:09:08.700
miles has made headlines again in 2020 among other things,

166
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:13.110
because in August Greece decided to extend its territorial waters in the Ionian

167
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:16.470
sea widget shares with Italy to 12 miles. And it didn't stop there.

168
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:20.280
Athens did not hesitate to assure that it would soon do the same in the Aegean.

169
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.860
Not surprisingly. The Turkish reaction was immediate.

170
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:28.670
<v 3>Turkey says Greece's decision to extend its territorial waters in a gene is a</v>

171
00:09:28.671 --> 00:09:31.760
cause of war. Hurry yet daily news.

172
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.410
<v 1>So far, it has not come to that,</v>

173
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.380
but the situation is more complicated than it seems. At first glance,

174
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.620
You see the central right new democracy party regained power in Greece in mid

175
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.520
2019. But to a large extent,

176
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:50.270
it did stop at the cost of feeding a nationalist agenda in order to compete with

177
00:09:50.271 --> 00:09:52.940
the extreme right views of the golden Dawn party,

178
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.740
the strategy has been successful,

179
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:59.450
but Kiriakos Mitsotakis the prime minister is now being held hostage by a

180
00:09:59.451 --> 00:10:01.550
nationalist faction with a new democracy,

181
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.380
with enough MPS to overthrow his government.

182
00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:06.560
<v 0>On the other hand.</v>

183
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.440
<v 1>We all know the Turkish president Erdogan has been emphatic.</v>

184
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:12.560
He assures that he will not allow the Aegean to become a Greek Lake.

185
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:16.490
And Kyra believes that if Greece were to extend its jurisdictional waters to 12

186
00:10:16.491 --> 00:10:20.030
miles, Turkey would be limited in its freedom of navigation. In this map,

187
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:25.010
you can see how the political map of the Aegean would change. The question is,

188
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.600
how on earth can all this be solved?

189
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:31.963
<v 0>Well.</v>

190
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.930
<v 1>Is complicated because Adam sees no need to negotiate anything.</v>

191
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.200
The current situation suits them and they feel that sitting down to talk to

192
00:10:39.201 --> 00:10:42.020
Turkey would mean making concessions with nothing to gain.

193
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:46.040
So the challenge now for the Mitsotakis government is not to get carried away by

194
00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.280
nationalists in responding to Turkish provocations, wait a minute.

195
00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:52.460
Provocations what provocations? Well, for example,

196
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.160
it is common for Turkish planes to invade Greek airspace.

197
00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.540
And not only that recently Turkey sent to the ORIC res an exploration vessel to

198
00:10:59.541 --> 00:11:02.900
do oil and gas prospecting in the vicinity of Casta rates.

199
00:11:02.901 --> 00:11:06.920
So we are talking about an area that Greece considers as its exclusive economic

200
00:11:06.921 --> 00:11:10.670
zone. In fact, a few months ago, the collision of a Greek for gate,

201
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.220
with a Turkish for gate escorting the ORIC race,

202
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.090
reignited the tensions in the air and take notes because it cannot be ruled out

203
00:11:17.091 --> 00:11:20.780
that Turkey, which has taken the initiative unilaterally in scenarios,

204
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:25.520
such as Iraq and Syria could organize an amphibious military operation on

205
00:11:25.521 --> 00:11:29.450
some Island in the Aegean and in the face of such a scenario. The question is,

206
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.690
how exactly is the Greek army placed? Could it deter the Turks?

207
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.790
How could it react to a possible attack?

208
00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.073
<v 0>Listen up.</v>

209
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:48.350
<v 3>There's is spa. Ah, if you were in charge.</v>

210
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.020
<v 1>Which of Greece, your first question would probably be,</v>

211
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:55.750
how could Turkey hit us after Raul Erdogan has adopted a doctrine known as the

212
00:11:55.751 --> 00:11:57.160
blue fatherland doctrine,

213
00:11:57.161 --> 00:12:00.670
by which Turkey claims control of the waters of the Eastern Jian and the

214
00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:04.540
Northern Mediterranean ignoring the rights generated by all Greek islands.

215
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.570
As you can imagine, this map has no international validity.

216
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:11.140
It is only valid if you are in Turkey or perhaps in a callback shop,

217
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.240
but friends, even with a good Turkish wrap,

218
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:16.090
the TURPs have not managed to convince anyone else. Of course,

219
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.150
that doesn't mean that anchor doesn't have a legal ACE up its sleeve.

220
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.670
Let me explain all those Greek islands in the East energy and were demilitarized

221
00:12:26.671 --> 00:12:31.230
by the Montreux convention and international agreement signed in 1936.

222
00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:31.710
However,

223
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:35.790
Greece claims it now has reason to mistrust Turkey since it invaded Cyprus,

224
00:12:35.791 --> 00:12:37.350
more than 40 years ago, come on,

225
00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:41.490
no amount of ouzo would persuade them to leave any of their islands defenseless.

226
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:43.830
So in the absence of tourists this year,

227
00:12:43.831 --> 00:12:46.680
many Greek soldiers were seen or one of these Ajai in islands.

228
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.680
And of course the Turkish protest was not long in coming.

229
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.390
Turkey says Greece unlawfully put more troops on Casta, Louisa,

230
00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.520
the national Herald. Given this scenario,

231
00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.420
it seems evident where the Turkish threat could materialize any Island in the

232
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.190
Eastern Ajai and bathed in waters,

233
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.520
which Ann Kartra claims are a part of that blue fatherland.

234
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.200
And my friends at present,

235
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:11.220
everything points to a confrontation between Greece and Turkey being marked by a

236
00:13:11.221 --> 00:13:15.270
clear Turkish superiority, both numerically and technologically. In fact,

237
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:19.260
they have their fourth army stationed in Izmir equipped with air and landing

238
00:13:19.261 --> 00:13:20.094
capabilities.

239
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.730
What's more Turkey is about to have its first helicopter carrier developed by

240
00:13:23.731 --> 00:13:26.850
the Turkish industry in a joint venture with stay with this,

241
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.560
the design of the Spanish company.

242
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.760
[inaudible] not only that the Turkish army is also equipped with more modern

243
00:13:32.761 --> 00:13:35.580
weaponry and has its own arms industry at its disposal.

244
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:36.630
Something that Greeks lack.

245
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:41.970
<v 0>Even. So.</v>

246
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:44.730
<v 1>The mid-scale confrontation would be more balanced than it seems.</v>

247
00:13:44.731 --> 00:13:48.060
Greece has been waiting for a Turkish move for decades and has the advantage

248
00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:50.100
that the territory to be defended is very small.

249
00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:53.190
So the Turkish numerical superiority would not be so important.

250
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.550
Of course the worst thing for Greece could be for Erdogan to bet on a fait

251
00:13:56.551 --> 00:13:58.980
accompli scenario, a Putin style strategy,

252
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.380
if the annexation of the Crimea or test anything,

253
00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:05.130
it is that the West response to the conquest of a territory is no longer as

254
00:14:05.131 --> 00:14:06.780
energetic as one might expect.

255
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.110
I lightening operation by Turkey to take over an Island like catch that'll

256
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:10.321
reach.

257
00:14:10.321 --> 00:14:14.040
So located a couple of kilometers off the Turkish coast and with a population of

258
00:14:14.041 --> 00:14:18.330
barely 500 people would give Erdogan a bargaining chip with winch to force a

259
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.600
negotiation on his maritime rights in the Aegean and the Mediterranean

260
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:28.500
To avoid this situation. Greece is organizing a spot in defense of its islands.

261
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:32.160
That is in fact what explains the trip movements denounced by Turkey.

262
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:34.770
They have also set their sights on modernizing their army.

263
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.490
The Greek government is taking advantage of all the opportunities that it has at

264
00:14:38.491 --> 00:14:39.300
its disposal.

265
00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.360
The most obvious one can be seen with what has been happening with the most

266
00:14:42.361 --> 00:14:44.580
modern fighters in the world. The F 35.

267
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:49.380
<v 0>Let me.</v>

268
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:53.060
<v 1>Explain Turkey has been a close of the United States since the cold war.</v>

269
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.400
So neither NATO nor the white house liked it.

270
00:14:55.401 --> 00:14:59.990
One bit that Erdogan decided is to buy the S 400 triumph air defense system

271
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:00.853
from Russia.

272
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:04.670
Obviously it doesn't seem like a good idea to hand over one of your best fighter

273
00:15:04.671 --> 00:15:05.001
planes,

274
00:15:05.001 --> 00:15:08.240
to someone who works with the technicians who designed the missiles that are

275
00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:11.390
supposed to take them down. So I'm in Athens and in Washington,

276
00:15:11.391 --> 00:15:13.130
they quickly saw the business opportunity.

277
00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:18.460
<v 4>Greece will get six U S F 35 fighter jets slated for Turkey.</v>

278
00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:19.450
The national Herald.

279
00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:23.590
<v 1>Not only that Greece has also deployed its best diplomatic artistry to form a</v>

280
00:15:23.591 --> 00:15:24.610
block against Turkey.

281
00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:28.420
That includes countries like Egypt with which it has concluded a maritime

282
00:15:28.421 --> 00:15:31.600
demarcation agreement and the United Arab Emirates,

283
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.720
which is wary of Turkey's ties with its rival Qatar.

284
00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:37.030
They also carry out military maneuvers with countries,

285
00:15:37.031 --> 00:15:38.530
such as Cyprus and Israel,

286
00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.590
which also class with Turkey over gas from the Mediterranean.

287
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.400
And they have taken very seriously. The idea of dazzling France and Italy,

288
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:49.390
two very influential countries that could eventually drag the European union

289
00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.970
into confronting Ertegun Macron, for example,

290
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.760
has already shown stronger position to the Turkish president,

291
00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.360
either out of conviction or the cause of what French politicians like best

292
00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.433
business.

293
00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:03.640
<v 4>Greece is purchase of French made fighter jets worth 2 billion Euro,</v>

294
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:04.870
Greek city times.

295
00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.140
<v 1>Right? A bill of 2 billion euros for Greece.</v>

296
00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:12.940
1.7 billion euros for 18 Rafale planes and another 300 million

297
00:16:12.941 --> 00:16:16.240
euros in weaponry. That's more than $2.4 billion.

298
00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.710
And this is not the end of the matter.

299
00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.950
Almost 4 million people of Turkish origin live in Germany.

300
00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.520
And is it for this reason? Berlin is very soft on Ertegun. Well,

301
00:16:24.521 --> 00:16:27.910
it seems that the next Greek order will be for four for Gates from Berlin.

302
00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:31.120
Now wait a minute. There is something that's grabbing your attention.

303
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.600
Have things changed so much in Greece that they can afford so much expenditure

304
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:35.523
on military.

305
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:45.850
<v 0>From the drama to drama seems great.</v>

306
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.030
<v 1>Became a founding member of the Eurozone at the economic level.</v>

307
00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.710
It has created nothing but trouble.

308
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.220
They spent every last draft summer organizing the Olympic games.

309
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:58.090
And since then they have lived almost constantly on the brink of crisis for

310
00:16:58.091 --> 00:17:02.380
years. The words tracker and rescue became more associated with this country,

311
00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.240
then Greek yogurt itself. However,

312
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:08.080
since then the situation has improved considerably Greek ten-year government

313
00:17:08.081 --> 00:17:11.590
bonds offer a yield of 0.68%. When in 2012,

314
00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:15.730
they were close to 40%. Athens can now get into debt without too much trouble.

315
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.970
So what is the problem then? Well, the Corona virus has once again,

316
00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:22.840
triggered Greece's appetite for debt and therefore the distrust of investors.

317
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.360
<v 4>Greece sees public debt at 208.9% of GDP in</v>

318
00:17:28.361 --> 00:17:30.070
2020, Yahoo finance.

319
00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:33.580
<v 1>In November, Greece faced its second nationwide confinement.</v>

320
00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:37.660
The Greek economy will fall this year by more than 10%, as you can imagine,

321
00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.170
it doesn't seem the best time for a war adventure in which Athens has nothing to

322
00:17:41.171 --> 00:17:42.004
gain.

323
00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:50.430
The military spending has grown by 10% since 2013, of course,

324
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.320
Turkish spending is three times higher.

325
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.260
Therefore even if they do want to modernize their armed forces,

326
00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:58.500
I'm sure that nobody in Athens wants to see one of those fighter planes that

327
00:17:58.501 --> 00:18:01.170
cost about 100 million euros get shot down in the Aegean.

328
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.550
So to avoid this scenario,

329
00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:06.330
NATO has been the arena where Greece and Turkey have settled their differences

330
00:18:06.331 --> 00:18:07.164
for the time being.

331
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.320
And what better way for an Alliance that emerged from the cold war then to

332
00:18:10.321 --> 00:18:13.620
provide a solution in the form of bingo, a phone line.

333
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:19.070
<v 4>Greece Turkey set up hotline to avoid clashes in Eastern Mediterranean NATO</v>

334
00:18:19.071 --> 00:18:20.570
says writers. Well.

335
00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:22.040
<v 1>As you can see at the moment,</v>

336
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:24.440
it seems that the waters have calmed down in the Aegean.

337
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:28.190
It is not in the interest of either party to continue to stir up tension and a

338
00:18:28.191 --> 00:18:31.970
confrontation would probably not outweigh any potential benefits to be gained.

339
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.600
But of course, when one of the players is Ertegun, anything can happen. Anyway,

340
00:18:35.601 --> 00:18:38.270
that's an outline of what could unfold at visual politics.

341
00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.240
We will be keeping an eye on what happens, but now it's your turn.

342
00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:45.170
Do you think Greece is taking the right steps at a diplomatic and military level

343
00:18:45.171 --> 00:18:49.880
to resist a Turkish offensive? Are you more of a fan of gyros or kebabs?

344
00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.630
