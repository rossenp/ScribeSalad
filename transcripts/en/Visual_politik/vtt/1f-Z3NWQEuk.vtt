<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.050
<v 1>A loan from the United States government to the Eastman Kodak company,</v>

3
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.590
the famous company that led the photography industry for decades to start

4
00:00:15.591 --> 00:00:18.380
manufacturing, pharmaceutical ingredients to fight COVID-19.

5
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.370
This news alone was enough to cause the iconic American company to skyrocket on

6
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.170
the stock exchange in just two sessions between 27th and 29th of July,

7
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.120
2020 Kodak shares Rose by 2190%. Yep. That's what I said.

8
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.640
2190%.

9
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.810
The share price increased 23 fold in just two days on the stock market.

10
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.760
The price went from $2 and 62 cents at the close of trading on 27th of July to

11
00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:53.750
$60 on the 29th. Of course, as you can see in this graph,

12
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.100
after reaching the $60 level, the action quickly corrected to the $8 level,

13
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.380
which was current at the time of preparing this video.

14
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.810
<v 0>Even. So.</v>

15
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.620
<v 1>That means multiplying the average price of the last few months by almost four.</v>

16
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.460
And that's kind of movement made us wonder what exactly has happened so that the

17
00:01:10.461 --> 00:01:14.780
shares of this company went from $2 to $60 and finally $8.

18
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.600
It's just a few days. And from there spring more quick,

19
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.840
And it's because of this, the price of Kodak shares has increased four fold,

20
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.070
but despite this,

21
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.780
the current market value of this company is that about $600 million a far cry

22
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.340
from the more than $20 billion that Kodak reached in 1994. At that time,

23
00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:39.290
the American photography giant represented 0.5% of the entire value of the SNP

24
00:01:39.291 --> 00:01:43.940
500, which in today's terms would be equivalent to a bounce of $150 billion.

25
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.160
<v 0>So.</v>

26
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.260
<v 1>What's happens to make Kodak collapse.</v>

27
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.990
How did the company that led the global photography market for more than a

28
00:01:50.991 --> 00:01:55.100
hundred years, lose more than 98% of its value and go bankrupt intimately.

29
00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.880
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

30
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.430
<v 1>Did you know that since then this company has tried at Slack with</v>

31
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.050
cryptocurrencies or that even built its own nuclear reactor in secret? Well,

32
00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:06.884
it's not. So.

33
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.880
<v 0>This.</v>

34
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.000
<v 1>Video of the series that we're making in conjunction with value score,</v>

35
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.510
we are going to tell you all the details about the fall of Kodak over the last

36
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:20.540
few decades. And it's surprising takeoff in the middle of the Corona.

37
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.200
<v 0>Why was crisis by the way.</v>

38
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.820
<v 1>Is that linked to value schools website?</v>

39
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.350
If you want to know more about this project.

40
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.980
<v 0>Make it easy. George Eastman.</v>

41
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.530
<v 1>Kind of the Steve jobs of his time. And no,</v>

42
00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:40.580
I'm really not exaggerating in 1874 at the age of 24,

43
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.410
good old George bought his first camera,

44
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.320
which at that time was not exactly common. And in fact,

45
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.590
what happened is that when he used it for the first time during a vacation,

46
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.320
he didn't manage to take a single picture. In those days,

47
00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:54.080
cameras were very different from the ones that we know they were much more

48
00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:56.840
difficult to use. It. Wasn't just a matter of pushing a button.

49
00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.580
You actually had to use individual glass plates for every single picture,

50
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.880
but you know what? This is precisely how the Kodak story begins.

51
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.990
Eastman didn't give up and hired a photographer to give him some private

52
00:03:07.991 --> 00:03:08.470
lessons.

53
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.670
You could say that's when his love affair with the world of photography began 14

54
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:14.410
years later in 1888,

55
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.520
Eastman registered the Kodak trademark and obtained a patent for a new camera

56
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.090
that used film instead of blast plates, the era of film had the gun,

57
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.990
which was obviously much easier and faster to take pictures with. And in fact,

58
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:27.580
the same technology could be applied to me.

59
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.540
<v 0>Movies. In fact.</v>

60
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.150
<v 1>From that moment on Kodak began to market its cameras,</v>

61
00:03:33.151 --> 00:03:35.340
using a slogan that reflected very well.

62
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.040
What would become the brand's philosophy? You press the button.

63
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.180
<v 0>We do the rest.</v>

64
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.060
<v 1>Wasn't the only indicator,</v>

65
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.420
the only distinguishing feature of the company Kodak's other major innovation

66
00:03:45.421 --> 00:03:49.140
also had a lot to do with trade policy, but it was something very different.

67
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.450
You see when selling their cameras Kodak soon,

68
00:03:51.451 --> 00:03:54.990
applied a bait and switch strategy equivalent to that of the razor companies

69
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.560
that is selling the camera at the lowest possible price and making money from

70
00:03:58.561 --> 00:04:01.980
the sale of reels rolls of film, photographic paper, and other.

71
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.383
<v 0>Applies.</v>

72
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.590
<v 1>They made the cameras accessible to the general public.</v>

73
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.100
What was feeding a market with constant income. And that's not all after all,

74
00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:14.130
this was a kind of business that was not so easy to get into making the film

75
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.010
roles was quite complex. It required a deep knowledge of chemistry,

76
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.040
especially when color photos became popular from the 1960s.

77
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.963
<v 0>Onwards.</v>

78
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.750
<v 1>And so it was that by the mid 1970s,</v>

79
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.770
Kodak had become by far the largest photo company in the world to give you an

80
00:04:28.771 --> 00:04:33.030
idea in the United States, it controlled 90% of the market for roll film,

81
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.800
85% of the market for cameras.

82
00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:38.100
And it was also a very important player in the medical imaging sector.

83
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.020
And not only that in the 1980s,

84
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.650
Kodak began to make a lot of corporate purchases to expand its business lines.

85
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.513
For example,

86
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.840
it took over IBM's medical diagnostics business and also acquired mass memory,

87
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.430
a company that manufactured the popular floppy disks in

88
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.480
1988,

89
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.550
it even launched a $5.1 billion cash takeover bid that's just over 11 billion

90
00:04:59.551 --> 00:05:02.790
in today's money on the pharmaceutical company Sterling drug.

91
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.430
The idea was to take advantage of the photo companies.

92
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.700
Chemical know how to break into the promising world of pharmacy.

93
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.550
<v 2>For Kodak shareholders.</v>

94
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.470
The merger will accelerate our entry into the more than $110 billion global

95
00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:17.610
pharmaceutical industry.

96
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.900
It will provide us with attractive long-term sales and profit potential Colby,

97
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.860
H Chandler, president and CEO of Kodak in 1988.

98
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.980
<v 1>Of course, a few years later,</v>

99
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.190
they had to sell this business for far less than they had acquired it for.

100
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.200
The fact is that in the early 1990s,

101
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.920
this company Kodak was a global Colossus employing more than

102
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.570
120,000 people. However, that was to be their last decade of success,

103
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.600
the fall over Colossus.

104
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.990
How is it possible that one of the largest multinationals in the United States,

105
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.350
a giant that had dominated the world market for more than a hundred years,

106
00:05:55.351 --> 00:06:00.230
went from achieving its all time sales record in 2001 to going bankrupt just

107
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:02.930
10 years later and practically disappearing. Okay.

108
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:06.080
So many of you may be thinking, Josh, this is an easy question.

109
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.770
We all know the answer, technological change and the advent of digital.

110
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.850
<v 0>Hammers. Well, yes.</v>

111
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.380
<v 1>And in a way, no,</v>

112
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.100
I'll explain one of the biggest risks that an investor faces is a technological

113
00:06:18.101 --> 00:06:21.730
disruption and a paradigm shift will soon overtake the business model of the

114
00:06:21.731 --> 00:06:23.830
company in which they have invested their money.

115
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.950
And it's true that in a way that's exactly what happened with Kodak,

116
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.070
but looked at it from a different angle. It's not that simple.

117
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.610
What would you say if I told you that the first digital camera was born in their

118
00:06:33.611 --> 00:06:36.070
laboratories as early as 1975,

119
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.490
that Kodak itself began marketing these cameras in the 1990s,

120
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.230
including the first professional digital camera in 1991, that's by 1993,

121
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.700
this company had already invested more than $5 billion in research on digital

122
00:06:48.701 --> 00:06:52.390
technology that in 97, you could find headlines like this.

123
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.120
<v 2>January 13th, 1997, how an outsider's version saved Kodak.</v>

124
00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.510
The remarkable turnaround that he has produced at Eastman Kodak,

125
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.520
George Fisher shows why the board chose him an outsider and late 1993 to run

126
00:07:06.521 --> 00:07:09.100
this company, Forbes friends.

127
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.970
<v 1>This is a much more interesting case than it might seem at first glance because</v>

128
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.540
codex vol was not so much related to technological change as it was to the

129
00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:20.200
company's management of its adaptation process and poor business strategy.

130
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.520
And you know what, in hindsight,

131
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.190
everything that happened up until the fall of this giant makes a lot.

132
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.440
<v 0>Of sense. But to.</v>

133
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.280
<v 1>Understand this story,</v>

134
00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:31.360
we have to go back to 1993 that's year Kodak chose George Fisher,

135
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:32.980
the first outsider in the company,

136
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.520
the 117 year history to lead this multinational,

137
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.830
you were chosen to carry out an internal revolution.

138
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:42.580
Although we may find the timeframe surprising way back in 1993 Fisher,

139
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.640
who came from Motorola was chosen to focus on one thing.

140
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.530
The business of digital photography.

141
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:49.690
<v 0>You.</v>

142
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.500
<v 1>See faced with the prospect that new digital technologies could wipe out Kodak's</v>

143
00:07:53.501 --> 00:07:54.130
business model.

144
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:58.330
The company devoted enormous resources to diversifying X activity four years.

145
00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.540
As we have already mentioned, they bought up pharmaceutical companies,

146
00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:03.880
clinical diagnosis companies and battery managers.

147
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:07.660
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

148
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.380
<v 1>They even developed their very own nuclear reactor to carry out their research.</v>

149
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.600
Yeah, yeah. A private nuclear reactor.

150
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.493
<v 0>Check it out.</v>

151
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.200
<v 2>Black reveals had secrets nuclear reactor for 30 years and dependent.</v>

152
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.510
<v 1>Oh, this was something that Fisher considered a serious,</v>

153
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.690
very serious mistake because it basically meant neglecting their main.

154
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:29.523
<v 0>Business.</v>

155
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.520
<v 2>Arrived. We were not investing in the core business.</v>

156
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:36.010
Think of the signal we sent to the core business teams.

157
00:08:36.011 --> 00:08:39.730
When most of the strategies and decisions have been diverting resources to other

158
00:08:39.731 --> 00:08:42.760
areas such as healthcare or consumer goods, George Fisher.

159
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.460
<v 1>No sooner said than done in his first year at the helm of the company Fisher and</v>

160
00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:51.700
his new team sold virtually every non-photo business.

161
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.190
He used the resources he raised to do two things,

162
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.960
reduce the group's debts to almost zero and invest heavily in the core business

163
00:08:57.961 --> 00:08:58.794
of photography.

164
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.660
<v 2>I think there was a fear of the digital while I was coming here,</v>

165
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:06.080
because I believe that the digital image and the core business of photography

166
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.430
have a symbiotic relationship, which is in fact exciting. George Fisher.

167
00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:15.350
<v 1>The idea behind this new equipment is that Kodak would be able to reproduce this</v>

168
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.770
ecosystem in a digital environment. In other words, in the longterm,

169
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.810
although much later than the market fought,

170
00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.430
the real ones would indeed disappear.

171
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.060
But Kodak understood that both the storage of the photographs and the printing

172
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.820
would more than compensate for this. And not only that,

173
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.360
they were also convinced that emerging countries like China would yield a lot.

174
00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:35.810
And I mean a lot of money. And in fact, that's the path they took.

175
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:39.800
They invested hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars into the Asian giant

176
00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.050
to create not only digital camera factories,

177
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.920
but also to encourage the opening of nearly 7,000 development shops,

178
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:48.220
however things, well, they didn't go.

179
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.410
<v 0>On the one hand.</v>

180
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.800
<v 1>Kodak had to face increasing competition in the field of film and photo</v>

181
00:09:54.801 --> 00:09:55.400
printing,

182
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.820
which affected the margins of the business that would sooner or later begin to

183
00:09:58.821 --> 00:09:59.960
see it. Sales decline.

184
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.440
This meant a reduction in economies of scale and the need to cut production

185
00:10:03.441 --> 00:10:07.280
capacity with all that. This entails layoffs, depreciation of assets,

186
00:10:07.281 --> 00:10:11.150
damage to image reduction of retail outlets and therefore of opportunities for

187
00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.670
cross-selling, et cetera, et cetera. Then on the other hand,

188
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.120
the company had to double down on its investment items in the new digital image

189
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.690
industry,

190
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.260
a world in which it's more than 100 years of experience with practically

191
00:10:21.261 --> 00:10:21.890
useless.

192
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:26.850
So between 1993 and 2000 Kodak spent almost $9 billion on R

193
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.793
and D.

194
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:29.750
<v 0>And finally.</v>

195
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:33.680
<v 1>The most important problem of all the digital ecosystem simply did not pack</v>

196
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:34.341
what's worse.

197
00:10:34.341 --> 00:10:37.460
The technological changes continued advancing until they reached the world.

198
00:10:37.461 --> 00:10:38.510
We all know today,

199
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.690
a world in which digital cameras have practically disappeared because they're

200
00:10:41.691 --> 00:10:43.880
now integrated into devices like mobile

201
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:50.840
To say that the changes came about at a much faster rate and Kodak's management

202
00:10:50.841 --> 00:10:54.320
had anticipated. And of course, after divesting itself of radically,

203
00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:55.820
all of the assets outside the world,

204
00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:59.840
photography Kodak had concentrated all its efforts on this business and the

205
00:10:59.841 --> 00:11:01.460
business model no longer worked.

206
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:03.410
<v 0>In.</v>

207
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:07.700
<v 1>This way from 2001, everything started to fall apart. And finally in 2012,</v>

208
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.620
the company went bankrupt. As you can see,

209
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.650
codex big problem was not so much the arrival of the digital camera,

210
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:15.800
but more that they put all of their eggs in one basket thinking they could

211
00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:19.460
dominate technological change whilst Kodak's management thought about making

212
00:11:19.461 --> 00:11:23.060
money from photo CDs or keeping their film real business going for quite some

213
00:11:23.061 --> 00:11:23.421
time,

214
00:11:23.421 --> 00:11:26.960
people started to share their photos digitally on networks like Facebook photo

215
00:11:26.961 --> 00:11:27.800
log or to NT.

216
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:30.410
<v 0>What would they pay Kodak.</v>

217
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:30.740
<v 1>For?</v>

218
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:34.130
And that's how the success story came to an end until now when it's made the

219
00:11:34.131 --> 00:11:34.964
headlines again.

220
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:37.490
<v 2>The Corona virus.</v>

221
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.120
<v 1>I told you at the beginning of this video during the month of August, 2020,</v>

222
00:11:44.121 --> 00:11:48.140
Kodak has grabbed many headlines thanks to its spectacular rise in market prices

223
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:48.980
in late July.

224
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.580
Kodak is now a much smaller company and continues to do basically what it is

225
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:54.880
always. However, over the last few years,

226
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:57.670
it has tried to regain its shimmer with many different projects,

227
00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.240
including a bit to launch its own crypto currency, Kodak coin,

228
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:03.970
something that also had an effect on the stock market, by the way.

229
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.680
<v 2>9Th of January, 2018,</v>

230
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.680
Kodak announces its own Kodak coin cryptocurrency.

231
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.580
And it shares soar by 125%. Shataka.

232
00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:18.570
<v 1>Well now in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic,</v>

233
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:22.320
Kodak wants to rescue it's bet on the pharmaceutical business and it wants to do

234
00:12:22.321 --> 00:12:26.490
so. Thanks to a loan of almost $800 million from the United States government to

235
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:30.900
manufacture pharmaceutical compounds with which to fight COVID 19. And that,

236
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.890
that was exactly what produced these spectacular reevaluation that the company

237
00:12:34.891 --> 00:12:38.550
came to experience in just two days of stock market activity.

238
00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.970
As we outlined at the beginning, however, at the time of preparing this video,

239
00:12:41.971 --> 00:12:45.630
the loan is not yet secure and not all the details are yet known.

240
00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.990
What we do know is that it has been a surprise that it is Kodak,

241
00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.800
a company outside of the drug business that has taken on such a contract.

242
00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:54.900
<v 2>Kodak,</v>

243
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.610
sheers plunge after $765 million us government loon hits hurdled

244
00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:04.230
federal agency to pause funding deal after recent allegations of wrongdoing,

245
00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.370
the financial times.

246
00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:10.440
<v 1>The question is will Kodak rise from the ashes. We cannot know,</v>

247
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:13.800
but what we do know for sure is that these sudden market movements have caused

248
00:13:13.801 --> 00:13:14.730
winners. Yes,

249
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.420
but also many people have also lost a lot of money in just a few days.

250
00:13:18.421 --> 00:13:22.200
The volatility created many millionaires and destroyed fortunes.

251
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:26.040
It was a wild speculative move in which the market suddenly became very much

252
00:13:26.041 --> 00:13:27.990
like a casino. And what do you want me to say?

253
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.970
We've prepared this video with value school.

254
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.960
So watch out for those jumps that can pulverize your savings going from $2 to

255
00:13:33.961 --> 00:13:38.190
$60. Sounds great. But going from $60 to $8 is very painful.

256
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.900
So what do you think about the rise and fall of Kodak?

257
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:47.550
How do you think you could have avoided it?
