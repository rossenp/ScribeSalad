00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:47.713
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

13
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.071
<v 2>So my friends,</v>

14
00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:59.510
China has become an expert at building cities from scratch cities and many cases

15
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.720
it's true end up empty, or with occupancy rates. Faba loads.

16
00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:05.000
Those initially estimated and the rest of the world,

17
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.360
they are known as China's ghost towns, but Nope,

18
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.210
we are not going to go there in this video because we've already told you about

19
00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:13.430
them several times before. And this video,

20
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.300
we will talk about the rise of one of G Jinping's own personal projects or

21
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.930
project. The Chinese president hopes will become a shining example of the future

22
00:01:20.931 --> 00:01:22.760
development model for the whole country.

23
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.250
A change of paradigm where the government, the state,

24
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.850
and G himself want to play a more leading role in development of the territory

25
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.880
and the local networks that make up the economic and social fabric,

26
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.920
contrary to what has been done so far.

27
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.160
But my friends far from the market criteria that define the evolution of the

28
00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:39.980
so-called special economic zones. As for example,

29
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.610
the well-known cases of Shang gin or the Pudong district in Shanghai,

30
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.630
this new development that we are going to look at today is completely different.

31
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.560
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

32
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.400
<v 2>I am referring to the new area of [inaudible] a project that is already underway</v>

33
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.700
and the aims to become the mega setting of the 21st century,

34
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.760
a new setting that will occupy three rural counties, rung,

35
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.150
Shang [inaudible] and [inaudible] and Hubei province.

36
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.260
But that's just the beginning.

37
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.390
Although the project estimates and his first phase,

38
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.970
this city will occupy 100 square kilometers.

39
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.860
The intention is that in the medium time,

40
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.390
its size will extend to 2000 kilometers squared to give you an idea that is

41
00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:22.220
almost three times more than the entire area of New York city located near

42
00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:24.140
Beijing, but in a much less developed area.

43
00:02:24.141 --> 00:02:25.880
And one with serious pollution problems,

44
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.390
Jong an aims to become the most technological best connected and most

45
00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:34.070
environmentally sustainable city in China by 2035 with a master plan that takes

46
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:37.520
into account several phases of development reaching until 2050.

47
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.850
The investment that the Chinese government has committed to this new urban space

48
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.240
is stratospheric. According to Morgan Stanley's estimates,

49
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.070
we are talking about a budget of between 170 and $300 billion of which

50
00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:52.760
approximately half will be used to revive this new metropolis with ultra modern

51
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:53.653
infrastructure.

52
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.190
The idea is that young and we'll complete the strategic from an economic point

53
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:00.550
of view.

54
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.880
The city will be located about a hundred kilometers from both Beijing and

55
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:07.000
champion and important ports and industrial setting. In addition,

56
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.360
it would be connected to the new Beijing airport getting there in just 20

57
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:12.940
minutes. That'd be only half an hour from Beijing city center.

58
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.990
Thanks to a high speed.

59
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.323
<v 1>Agree.</v>

60
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.200
<v 2>These strategic ambitions because of the enormous challenge of represents many</v>

61
00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:25.650
analysts and experts have compared this project to the cases of Shang Gen-X,

62
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.280
which is promoted by president Daniel Jiping in the 1980s and the Pudong

63
00:03:29.281 --> 00:03:32.850
district and Shanghai, which was promoted by Zhang Zimmerman and the 1990s.

64
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.590
<v 1>I'm sorry to say that Maxine will go.</v>

65
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.690
<v 2>In fact,</v>

66
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.410
it was precisely the establishment of these two special economic areas that laid

67
00:03:43.411 --> 00:03:45.120
the foundation of modern China,

68
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.600
a China that is open to the market and to the world. However,

69
00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:52.530
my friends GJ Pang's pet project doesn't really resemble either of his

70
00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:53.250
predecessors.

71
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.570
What Zhang is trying to do here is just the opposite to show that a new

72
00:03:57.571 --> 00:04:02.460
socialist China is possible firmly led by the Chinese communist party assessing

73
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.030
where the most important thing is not market oriented economic growth,

74
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.560
but the state itself hold on can a project that does not pooped private

75
00:04:10.561 --> 00:04:14.220
initiative first be successful. What can be learned from past experiences?

76
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.360
I young and be a success or a failure before answering these questions.

77
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.870
We will take a closer look at Shanghai in the late that illuminated the Dawn of

78
00:04:21.871 --> 00:04:22.890
the Asian giant,

79
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.790
the first successful large scale experiment that changed the Chinese model

80
00:04:26.791 --> 00:04:28.500
forever. But before we get started,

81
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.190
you should probably check out our other channel, newly launched visual Academy.

82
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.520
It covers all the most interesting people, places and periods in history.

83
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.960
It's got fantastic animation. It's voiced by a very hands-on sounding guy.

84
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.130
You should check it out by now.

85
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:42.743
<v 1>Cracking</v>

86
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.400
the symbol of the dung scalping revolution.

87
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.700
<v 2>When we are talking about the phenomenal transformation of China and most cases,</v>

88
00:04:56.701 --> 00:04:59.730
we are not really aware of the dizzying speed with which it occurred,

89
00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.380
nor what the starting point.

90
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.370
<v 1>You see.</v>

91
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.740
<v 2>In the late 1970s, then Chinese leader,</v>

92
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.340
Danielle pink was warned that food production and industry levels were rapidly

93
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.200
declining. It was a risk that scenario,

94
00:05:13.201 --> 00:05:17.430
similar to the great Chinese famine that killed millions of people between 1959

95
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.450
and 1961 would be repeated for this reason, den gel pen,

96
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.450
a leader who had already belonged to the reformist wing of the government in the

97
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.050
Mt era,

98
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.310
decided to try his luck with a new economic system that started at a small and

99
00:05:29.311 --> 00:05:33.240
poor fishing village of barely 30,000 inhabitants. There was a touch.

100
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.320
<v 1>Oh, you're talking.</v>

101
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.330
<v 2>Of course about xingjian</v>

102
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.000
There in Guangdong province.

103
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.240
The Chinese government established the first special economic zones in their

104
00:05:48.241 --> 00:05:51.930
history and the first space in mainland China where private investment and

105
00:05:51.931 --> 00:05:54.240
business were allowed in the modern era. In fact,

106
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:55.470
looking at it from the present,

107
00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.990
we can say that this special economic was the first student in the foundation of

108
00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:04.190
the new China to give you an idea that small fishing village of barely three

109
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:08.750
kilometers squared grew and grew and grew to become a giant with

110
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.370
12 million inhabitants,

111
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.930
2000 square kilometers of surface area on a GDP equivalent to that of all of

112
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.810
Israel or a quarter of that, of all of Spain,

113
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.400
but the historical average annual growth of more than 20% and more than $30,000

114
00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:24.920
of GDP per capita from an economic point of view,

115
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.580
Shenzhen is already at the level of some of the most developed countries in the

116
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:31.040
world so much so that in the four decades,

117
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:33.110
since this special economic area was established,

118
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.100
James ends wealth has increased 10,000 fold. Yeah,

119
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.300
you heard that correctly by 10,000 teams in just 40 years.

120
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:45.880
Amazing, therefore,

121
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.940
but this has been precisely the engine of the new China that we know today and

122
00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:52.570
the place that I've seen the birth of companies as well known as Huawei 10 cent

123
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.300
or ZTE, or that it was out of interest.

124
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.900
The first destination that Zhang Pang visited when he started his job as general

125
00:06:58.901 --> 00:07:01.060
secretary of the party in 2012.

126
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.520
<v 3>Echoes of dung scalping as CGMP heads to Shen Jen on first inspection</v>

127
00:07:06.521 --> 00:07:07.390
trip, SC.

128
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:12.040
<v 2>P in fact, this metropolis is home to some 70,000 technology companies,</v>

129
00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.150
which means that roughly 5% of Shankdon's GDP goes to research and development,

130
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.100
however, blind, these crazy figures,

131
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.200
there is more than just a special economic zone.

132
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:23.830
You see we're location chosen for what was one of the first capitalist zones in

133
00:07:23.831 --> 00:07:27.850
China, right beside Hong Kong and Macau was by no means a coincidence

134
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.820
1979, Hong Kong and Macau were too much richer and more developed territories.

135
00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:40.180
And the rest of mainland China and the differences between Schengen and

136
00:07:40.181 --> 00:07:43.750
neighboring Gonzo were radical precisely because of this,

137
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.620
the choice of the small cities of Shanghai and Shanto and Zhuhai and Guangdong

138
00:07:47.621 --> 00:07:50.920
province of the city of Zaman and Fijian province and the Island province of

139
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.610
high nun for the Chinese government's first capitalist experiment was not a

140
00:07:54.611 --> 00:07:55.930
matter of chance.

141
00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.830
One of the keys was to generate symbiosis with Hong Kong and Macau to take

142
00:07:59.831 --> 00:08:03.700
advantage of the experience activity and enormous human and financial capital of

143
00:08:03.701 --> 00:08:07.210
those two enclaves in order to promote the development of the Chinese mainland.

144
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.430
At the same time, if the experiment worked,

145
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.550
it would create an integrated area that would basically facilitate the future

146
00:08:12.551 --> 00:08:14.560
absorption of Macau and Hong Kong,

147
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.530
which at that time were not yet under Chinese sovereignty.

148
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:22.470
And as we all know today, the plan worked wonders both economically. And

149
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:27.340
It does my friends,

150
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:31.540
the shingles development model began to be replicated all over China during the

151
00:08:31.541 --> 00:08:34.720
1980s and 1990s, until we reached the present day,

152
00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:38.680
the G Zhang Pang era G who is considered the most powerful Chinese president

153
00:08:38.681 --> 00:08:40.420
since Moussa dome. And at the same time,

154
00:08:40.421 --> 00:08:43.180
the leader of the economically strongest China in history,

155
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:46.570
and tends to try his luck with a new model of a special economic area,

156
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:50.140
a model that has little to do with the one that brought success and development

157
00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.780
to China. Do you want to see it? Of course you do.

158
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.040
So now let's take a look at [inaudible] new Chinese.

159
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.873
<v 1>Dream.</v>

160
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:05.030
[inaudible].

161
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:07.640
<v 4>The own gun seize model for China.</v>

162
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.740
<v 2>They've already told you the new John and area aims of Rick with the model of</v>

163
00:09:12.741 --> 00:09:17.000
the traditional special economic areas that power the current Chainer GJ ping

164
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:21.290
wants to spend obscene amounts on his gamble of a new model for the future.

165
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:26.150
That according to him will guide the next 1000 years of socialism with

166
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.320
Chinese characteristics.

167
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:33.080
<v 4>C has a more convinced view of the necessity of a very large direct state</v>

168
00:09:33.081 --> 00:09:37.490
role in the economy than dung ever did. Arthur Kerber, China researcher,

169
00:09:37.491 --> 00:09:40.610
and managing director of Gavi called Dragonomics.

170
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.550
<v 2>And it's technically a special economic area.</v>

171
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.430
The truth is the market criteria will not be the priority,

172
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:50.030
nor will the market agents, the companies have the leadership, no,

173
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.133
nothing like that.

174
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:57.110
There's a special zone piloted and financed entirely by the central government,

175
00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:59.420
a setting by and for.

176
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:00.703
<v 1>The state.</v>

177
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.240
<v 2>In fact, as you can see in this graph,</v>

178
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.540
the Chinese government intends Jong and to be the largest public investment

179
00:10:08.541 --> 00:10:09.980
project and the entire.

180
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:11.810
<v 1>History of change,</v>

181
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.620
but it doesn't end there.

182
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.580
<v 2>This project will not be led by private companies as the state that intends to</v>

183
00:10:31.581 --> 00:10:34.700
pilot the process through a huge investment of public resources,

184
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:39.410
none of them being orientated to international investment and take note

185
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.070
because not even the real estate activity will fall to private initiative each

186
00:10:43.071 --> 00:10:46.850
and every residential complex to be built in Japan will be promoted by the state

187
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.940
and the property will remain public, which by the way,

188
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.350
has very significant costs.

189
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:57.620
<v 1>For example.</v>

190
00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:01.070
<v 2>Well, the public monopoly on real estate activity will mean that Joan will not</v>

191
00:11:01.071 --> 00:11:03.710
generate the huge revenues from real estate transactions,

192
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.280
like the many billions and foreign investment injected into the development

193
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:12.230
process of the [inaudible] area and many other economic areas dotted

194
00:11:12.231 --> 00:11:14.330
around the country. And by the way,

195
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.640
as there is no private ownership of land in China,

196
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.380
the farmers currently working in the zone,

197
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:22.160
an area will be immediately dispossessed with compensation that the state will

198
00:11:22.161 --> 00:11:26.930
decide arbitrarily seasons of farmers will face serious difficulties. No,

199
00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:27.650
exactly. Okay.

200
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:28.483
<v 1>Great. Start</v>

201
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:34.370
by the way.

202
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:38.120
<v 2>One of the ironies is the living in Joan and will be closely linked to work.</v>

203
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.340
This may not sound like a bad idea at all,

204
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.100
but there is a problem since the housing is state owned,

205
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.820
it's tied to the job and many believe that losing your job or moving to another

206
00:11:46.821 --> 00:11:50.600
one outside of Yangon will mean losing the right to live and the city as well,

207
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.880
even more control for the one party.

208
00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:01.350
But the big question is if this macro plan has been designed without putting

209
00:12:01.351 --> 00:12:04.560
private initiative first, what are the intend to fund it with?

210
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:08.340
What does yang Pang intend to be the driving force of what is being hailed as

211
00:12:08.341 --> 00:12:12.780
China's greatest city, perhaps even the future capital of the whole country?

212
00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.940
Well, although it may seem strange to you,

213
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.420
the gamble is the Jong-un will be set up to absorb the non administrative

214
00:12:18.421 --> 00:12:21.300
functions of Beijing and its first stage.

215
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:24.210
And this way the Chinese government wants to move universities,

216
00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.820
public companies, hospitals, research centers,

217
00:12:26.821 --> 00:12:29.550
and organizations of all canes there,

218
00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:34.530
everything of course that is state owned or closely controlled by the state.

219
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.440
It is even intended. The private participation could take place,

220
00:12:37.441 --> 00:12:40.470
but only through consortium's that allow private companies to operate,

221
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:44.070
but where the Chinese government always takes the lead. In other words,

222
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.300
what Zhang Peng proposes is nothing less than to create a Fort a new city that

223
00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:51.810
is not based on trade or competition, but on the public sector.

224
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.500
And he also wants it to be the emblem of the new China.

225
00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.050
<v 5>Along these.</v>

226
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.630
<v 2>[Inaudible] the development plans and visions of the population of this new</v>

227
00:13:03.631 --> 00:13:07.320
metropolis will grow to more than 7 million inhabitants over the next few

228
00:13:07.321 --> 00:13:07.920
decades,

229
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.120
while at the same time becoming a model of sustainability because the Chinese

230
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.570
president's idea is that, and will also be a green setting.

231
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:19.140
I trained the Guinea pig on how to build urban models and a new era of low

232
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.220
emission companies, industries, and transports, all of which may sound strange.

233
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.650
And the world's most polluting country in any case,

234
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.920
the first step has to be to close all factories and companies and the area that

235
00:13:28.921 --> 00:13:31.470
doesn't meet the new standards since 2017,

236
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.890
the Chinese government has ordered the closure of more than 5,000 companies and

237
00:13:34.891 --> 00:13:38.120
factories and the region. And the process will continue until the area is.

238
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:39.090
<v 5>Is cleaned up.</v>

239
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.800
<v 2>Let's take one moment here.</v>

240
00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:47.100
Many experts who have thoroughly analyzed the project believed that not only

241
00:13:47.101 --> 00:13:49.110
will it not replicate Schengen success,

242
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.020
but there is a high risk that the city will become a complete.

243
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:53.543
<v 5>Feeling.</v>

244
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.920
<v 2>Can may explain this idea of building a set date based almost exclusively on</v>

245
00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:02.220
several severance and public money on which is far removed from the dynamic of

246
00:14:02.221 --> 00:14:04.830
competition and market innovation. Well, what can I say?

247
00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:08.070
And if we take into account whose hands are controlling the Chinese public

248
00:14:08.071 --> 00:14:10.950
sector, well then the picture is even more bleak.

249
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.340
Having said that the question we should be asking at this point is can a new

250
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:18.120
city that is oblivious to the demands of the market succeed in 21st century,

251
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.510
China, does it really have something unique, something groundbreaking to offer?

252
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.670
Well, let's take a look.

253
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.040
<v 5>Story of a predicted failure.</v>

254
00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.210
<v 2>When we speak of failure and Chinese terms,</v>

255
00:14:36.211 --> 00:14:38.940
we did not mean that the city will not be built or that it will not be a step

256
00:14:38.941 --> 00:14:40.050
forward for the region.

257
00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.350
Remember that this is an undeveloped rural area and any investment in

258
00:14:43.351 --> 00:14:46.200
infrastructure companies, hospitals, universities,

259
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.560
and other facilities will undoubtedly be an improvement on the original

260
00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.160
saturation. However, realistically, it is very,

261
00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:55.790
very likely that the model that Zhang Pang wants to test for China's future here

262
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.800
will simply not work.

263
00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:04.540
The first problem is its location. Unlike Shang Gen-X,

264
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.610
which is next to the financial hub of Hong Kong,

265
00:15:06.611 --> 00:15:10.960
and also has direct access to the sea [inaudible] is inland and an area that is

266
00:15:10.961 --> 00:15:12.940
very cold and winter warm in summer.

267
00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.880
And we're living conditions are basically unpleasant.

268
00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.910
And although the infrastructure that is already being built is impressive and

269
00:15:18.911 --> 00:15:21.490
promises to connect the new Ceci to Beijing in half an hour.

270
00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.340
It is not entirely clear that this will convince people to move there.

271
00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.670
At least not in the numbers that Beijing expense. In addition,

272
00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:29.350
let's consider the regulations,

273
00:15:29.351 --> 00:15:32.290
there'll be in place for private activities and the plans for the public sector

274
00:15:32.291 --> 00:15:34.060
to be the one that plays the leading role.

275
00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.720
John May well end up becoming a boring set of public workers,

276
00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.350
forcibly transferred from Beijing, hardly a massive salient.

277
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:45.873
<v 5>[Inaudible].</v>

278
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:48.640
<v 2>Jonathan has tough competition and China itself.</v>

279
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.970
What would lead you to establish a business and Jong on if you were also able to

280
00:15:51.971 --> 00:15:54.040
do it, for example, and the young Z Delta.

281
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.800
<v 5>No.</v>

282
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.950
<v 2>Apart from the doubts about the success of this setting or the rejection of a</v>

283
00:16:02.951 --> 00:16:06.610
project that seems and practice nothing more than a return to old Soviet

284
00:16:06.611 --> 00:16:09.670
projects of the mid 20th century ones that were designed to consolidate the

285
00:16:09.671 --> 00:16:11.350
power of the communist party elites.

286
00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.800
The truth is that the ambition of Zhang Peng and the enormous amounts of money

287
00:16:14.801 --> 00:16:19.420
involved could give rise to a very odd Cain of SETI museum and ultra modern

288
00:16:19.421 --> 00:16:19.900
setting.

289
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.720
It was built overnight and a place where there was little more than rice fields

290
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.280
and very humble peasant houses.

291
00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:28.600
<v 4>I wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't work half as successfully as China</v>

292
00:16:28.601 --> 00:16:29.410
expects,

293
00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:33.130
but it will be more impressive than anything we've seen in the West for 50

294
00:16:33.131 --> 00:16:34.840
years, shall rune Ling,

295
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:38.170
urban development expert at the national development and reform.

296
00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:42.130
<v 5>[Inaudible].</v>

297
00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:42.880
<v 2>You know, as it may,</v>

298
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.160
we'll have to wait until at least 2035 to see what happens with John,

299
00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.410
but my friends for the moment,

300
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.260
the bill dozers and grains have already entered the three counties and the

301
00:16:50.261 --> 00:16:53.860
construction of the main infrastructure is already well underway. For example,

302
00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:55.450
the zone on mega train station,

303
00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.990
which was it's 475 square meters on a cost of more than

304
00:16:58.991 --> 00:17:02.410
$1.1 billion will be the central communications hub of Joan.

305
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.340
And this station is expected to open its doors between the end of 2020 and the

306
00:17:06.341 --> 00:17:07.600
beginning of 2021.

307
00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:14.410
<v 5>[Inaudible].</v>

308
00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:15.130
<v 2>In any case,</v>

309
00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:18.700
what is clear is that we are no facing a new experiment with a single objective

310
00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:22.090
to consolidate the power of Zhang ping and the political aristocrats of the

311
00:17:22.091 --> 00:17:25.330
Chinese communist party notes that while John was being launched,

312
00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:29.200
Zhang Pang has also announced the creation of new special economic zones. So,

313
00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.620
and itself Joan and does not represent a departure from China's economic

314
00:17:32.621 --> 00:17:36.190
development policy, but the experiment is well underway.

315
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:37.660
I know it's over to you.

316
00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:41.020
Do you think the first great city of the 21st century designed to turn his back

317
00:17:41.021 --> 00:17:43.870
on the private sector can succeed as an isolated project?

318
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.690
Or do you think it will become a point of reference for future projects and

319
00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:50.640
China, and how badly did I pronounce all the Chinese names in this video?
