00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.590
<v 0>The first laser beam attack and history occurred on August the fourth, 2019.</v>

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.540
And I'm being serious. I have not lost it.

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.240
Laser beams really do exist and have already been used in.

4
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:14.060
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

5
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.850
<v 0>Well, we are talking about the demolition of a combat room in the ceremony.</v>

6
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.133
<v 1>War.</v>

7
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.750
<v 0>Rune belongs to the Syrian rebels. And who do you think fired the laser beam?</v>

8
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.560
Which country could be advanced enough to have laser weapons ready to fire?

9
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.030
Many of you will guess the United States or maybe China or Russia. Well,

10
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.960
believe it or not,

11
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.820
the first country to use laser beams in human history was older run. No kidding.

12
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.683
It was Turkey.

13
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.553
<v 1>It's Turkey.</v>

14
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.980
<v 0>No, I guess your head has already exploded.</v>

15
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.170
How is it possible that laser beams exist?

16
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.680
And how is it possible that Turkey has them before any other country?

17
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.700
Since when is Turkey a tech leader and how exactly delays or beams work,

18
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.720
don't worry. And this video, we're going to explain everything let's get.

19
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.553
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

20
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.770
<v 0>The question many of us are asking ourselves right now is who needs Netflix in</v>

21
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:15.590
the year 2020. If everything we hear in the news is real.

22
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.830
It's almost as if Alex Jones has possessed us all this year.

23
00:01:18.831 --> 00:01:21.290
We have seen the SARS coronavirus two pandemic,

24
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.100
the seizing of Hong Kong by China and even Bruce Willis dressed up as Mon.

25
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.263
<v 1>Hi.</v>

26
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.450
<v 0>Things couldn't possibly get any weirder, right? Well,</v>

27
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.990
in case all of this wasn't enough. We're now bringing you laser beams.

28
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.990
We've seen them in hundreds of movies, and now they're a reality.

29
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.270
And many of you will be thinking, but apart from cutting,

30
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.410
what advantage to laser beams have over, let's say ordinary missiles. Well,

31
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.100
lots, basically a laser beam travels at the speed of light,

32
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.320
which means it is practically impossible to Dodge

33
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.810
Clear definition of perfect shot. In fact, thanks to laser beams.

34
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.170
Turkey was able to take down a moving drone with complete precision,

35
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.720
and you'll say, but how do laser beams work? Well,

36
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.480
that is why we're going to have to talk about quantum physics.

37
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.470
And please don't leave.

38
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.020
Jay's not going to be as boring as your physics classes in high school.

39
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.710
For that reason, Javier son, Viola has advised us in the making of this video.

40
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.530
And I'd like to apologize to Javier for how I just pronounced his name.

41
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.530
He is one of the most famous physics YouTubers in Spanish.

42
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.940
Have you want to take a look at his channel?

43
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.550
It's in Spanish and the link is here, but that's not all.

44
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.270
He's also one of the scientists who discovered the Higgs boson. In other words,

45
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.390
we're talking about the real deal in the world of physics.

46
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.920
But before we talk about science,

47
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.390
we need to talk about politics because my visual polar Migos Turkey is kingdom

48
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.390
NATO's.

49
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.223
<v 1>Boy.</v>

50
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.250
<v 0>That is if ethnical was the classic school in a 1980s, film,</v>

51
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.100
Turkey would be the class thug. The one who's always looking to pick a fight.

52
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.530
<v 1>Everyone, for example.</v>

53
00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.920
<v 0>Turkey gets along really badly with Greece,</v>

54
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.530
which is also a natal member and the United States,

55
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.630
which would be the captain of the American football team.

56
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:08.140
In the school scenario we were talking about does not sell weapons to Turkey.

57
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.110
And since the Turks can't buy guns from the United States,

58
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.530
what do you think they're doing? Well, here is a clue.

59
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.623
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

60
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.460
<v 2>Turkey's is it bought Russia's S 400 air defense system to use it not to put it</v>

61
00:03:23.461 --> 00:03:24.294
aside.

62
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.750
<v 0>It seem insignificant, but this news is actually very important.</v>

63
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.230
At the end of the day. Russia is NATO is antagonist and Turkey,

64
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.960
which is a member of NATO is buying weapons from them.

65
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.350
That is something that we asked NATO, secretary general yen, Salton Berg,

66
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.760
when we interviewed him last year.

67
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.090
<v 3>And of course these new, uh, um, uh,</v>

68
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.350
S 400, uh, air defense systems, uh,

69
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.160
which are Russian will not be integrated into Nate.

70
00:03:50.161 --> 00:03:52.170
Those integrated air missile defense.

71
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.850
There will be a standalone thing outside the natals, uh, elephant system.

72
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.870
<v 0>But not only that Turkey is one of the countries that spends the most money on</v>

73
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.890
its military. And in fact,

74
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.700
they have the second largest army of all the NATO countries after United States.

75
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.400
At least as far as the number of soldiers is consent. Of course,

76
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.170
when we talk about defense soldiers,

77
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.500
aren't everything technology and weaponry are becoming increasingly more

78
00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:17.460
important. And in that aspect, Turkey has never been a leading player.

79
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.790
Think of it this way. Although, as a country that has 80 million inhabitants,

80
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.730
it only has the same level of GDP as the Netherlands.

81
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.420
And that's why it's so amazing, but they pioneered laser beams.

82
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.500
How is that possible? Why does Turkey have laser beams? How do they work today?

83
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.890
We're going to answer this question, but first let's look at some history.

84
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.970
<v 1>NATO's bad boy, before.</v>

85
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.280
<v 0>We go any further, I want you to take a look at this.</v>

86
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.930
This is the Bosphorus straits and belongs to Turkey. However,

87
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.470
this street is the only direct access to the Mediterranean that Russia could

88
00:04:55.471 --> 00:04:59.400
have for centuries. Russia has wanted to control it, and Turkey will let them,

89
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.190
both countries do not know the meaning of the word diplomacy.

90
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.820
And this explains why Russia and Turkey have been sworn enemies for centuries.

91
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:06.773
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

92
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.530
<v 0>What does all this mean then? Well, during the cold war, it meant a lot.</v>

93
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.740
Basically Turkey was the most anti-Soviet country in the world,

94
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.890
and that's why in 1952, they joined NATO.

95
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.880
Ultimately NATO was a military Alliance to defend itself against the Soviet

96
00:05:23.881 --> 00:05:24.300
union.

97
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.960
And Turkey had a very large army and plenty of anticommunist credentials to be

98
00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:29.820
received by needle with open arms.

99
00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.090
No problem. Well, as we said before,

100
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.750
Turkey is the bad guy in class and they don't get on with anybody.

101
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.860
Think about it. Turkey has a long and rich Imperial past for centuries.

102
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.790
Turkey was known as the Ottoman empire and dominated a huge territory.

103
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.160
This Imperial past left many dead along the way,

104
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.850
including a genocide against the Armenians clashes with the Kurdish minority and

105
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.500
an ongoing conflict with Greece over the Island of Cyprus. And you'll say,

106
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.370
is this really a problem today? Well, the truth has yet in 1974,

107
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:03.020
Turkey invaded the Island of Cyprus.

108
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.930
Since then the Island has been divided into two halves on one,

109
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.520
they speak Turkish and on the other.

110
00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:08.523
<v 1>Do you speak Greek.</v>

111
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.020
<v 0>And imagine Greece,</v>

112
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.080
which is also a member of NATO does not get along with Turkey.

113
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.920
This all helps explain why. And the 1970s, the United States said to Turkey,

114
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.960
okay, there Turkey. We're going to protect you.

115
00:06:22.961 --> 00:06:25.930
But since we don't trust you at all, because of your inherent bad Boyness,

116
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.900
we're not going to sell you any guns. Goodness knows what you do with them.

117
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.470
And I'd like to apologize to all the Americans for the accent, but anyway,

118
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.870
Turkey is officially an ally of the United States,

119
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.670
but can hardly buy any weapons from them.

120
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.400
And what do you think Turkey's answer was well, Rachel, then,

121
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.570
since you want to sell me your guns,

122
00:06:40.571 --> 00:06:44.080
I guess I'll just go ahead and create my own arms industry and the problem apart

123
00:06:44.081 --> 00:06:46.030
from the fact that I can't do a Turkish accent, well,

124
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.510
Turkey doesn't have any silicone Valley or anything that looks remotely like it.

125
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.370
So what happened for decades?

126
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.610
The most remarkable thing in Turkey had for the Jew Baria missile launchers,

127
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:55.473
the biggest ones,

128
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.330
Apart from that, no one has ever said, Oh, Turkish, military technology,

129
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.090
give me 10 of them. In fact, in the two thousands,

130
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.140
the anchor government began to shelve all these military programs after all.

131
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.500
Why did they want so many weapons if they were already protected by NATO?

132
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.920
Interestingly, these were the years when Turkey began to grow economically.

133
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.500
It was even discussed whether they could join NATO irate,

134
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:25.300
but all this changed in 2016. So what happened in 2016? Well.

135
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:28.780
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

136
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.090
<v 2>They will pay a heavy price for their treason,</v>

137
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.790
Turkish soldiers surrender on Bosphorus bridge.

138
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:38.620
After overnight military coup fails ending with 250 dead as

139
00:07:38.621 --> 00:07:40.810
president air to one bows. Revenge.

140
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.590
<v 0>Exactly. We are talking about the coup against Turkey's president Erdogan,</v>

141
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.940
a coup that many believe was set up by Erewhon himself and event that gave him

142
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:53.560
the perfect excuse to change the country's constitution and secure even more

143
00:07:53.561 --> 00:07:54.610
power since then.

144
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:58.930
Everyone's new goal seems to be the restoration of the Ottoman empire to control

145
00:07:58.931 --> 00:08:02.470
North Africa again. So the whole world will be afraid of the Turkish army.

146
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.920
And at the same time, the Turkish army would also be afraid of Erewhon.

147
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.540
And that's why he took measures.

148
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:12.220
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

149
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.980
<v 2>And purges army and judiciary after failed.</v>

150
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.800
<v 0>To give you some idea. After this military purge,</v>

151
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:22.000
there was only 20 fighter pilots left. That is Turkey has 200 fighter planes,

152
00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:24.490
but only 20 people. You can actually fly them.

153
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.890
And something similar happened in the other divisions of the army,

154
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.800
basically by removing all the factions that might be against him.

155
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.830
Everyone has been left with a skeleton army, and you're probably wondering,

156
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.120
so how is he going to expand the new Ottoman empire without any soldiers? Well,

157
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.480
everyone has tried to buy weapons from the United States.

158
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.030
<v 2>Turkey seeks us Patriot missiles to deter Russia and Syria.</v>

159
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:53.080
<v 0>As you can imagine, America's answer was, let's see here to when kiddo,</v>

160
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.290
what do you want those Patriot missiles for? Huh?

161
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.180
You're not going to use them to kill Kurds again, are you?

162
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.180
I've got my eye on you, you know, far from falling in with air Dwan.

163
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.220
Trump has put new sanctions on Turkey.

164
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.430
Why punishment for mistreatment of the Kurdish minority? I,

165
00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:07.850
my Northy as an ally of the United.

166
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.313
<v 1>Stinks.</v>

167
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.550
<v 0>The idea the Kurds have been instrumental in the fight against ISIS.</v>

168
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.390
So Trump is not going to sell weapons to Turkey, to attack his own allies.

169
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:24.440
As I told you earlier, Turkey is still NATO's bad, boy. Yes, we have his back,

170
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:28.130
but we're interested in keeping track of him as well. So once again,

171
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:31.790
NATO is protecting Turkey, but doesn't want Turkey to have its a weaponry,

172
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.290
which explains news.

173
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.460
<v 1>Spain extends air defense system deployment in Turkey.</v>

174
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.200
<v 0>This all mean, well,</v>

175
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.980
Spain is an ally of the United States and has Patriot missiles.

176
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.910
NATO has told them to set up a few to protect Turkey's border with a run,

177
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.780
but that's all. And as you can imagine, that doesn't make Erawan very happy.

178
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.870
He wants to have his own weaponry and his own military doctrine. In fact,

179
00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:01.190
Turkey is a player and the Libyan war and they have their own alliances and

180
00:10:01.191 --> 00:10:05.090
their own strategy separate from NATO. That's what they need weaponry for.

181
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.810
So as the United States continues its policy of not selling them. Weapons.

182
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:12.560
Turkey has reopened as military industrial development programs and those

183
00:10:12.561 --> 00:10:15.320
programs include technology like this.

184
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.640
<v 1>[Inaudible] laser weapons system to strengthen military. So.</v>

185
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.040
<v 0>Laser beams have many advantages.</v>

186
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:29.120
They are a very promising technology to defend against anti aircraft attacks and

187
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.300
to operate them. You need a new military personnel. I mean,

188
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.020
everyone has the perfect excuse to hire new soldiers who are loyal to him.

189
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.650
But the question is, what are laser beams? Why are they used for well.

190
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:46.850
<v 1>[Inaudible] laser beams, the new gunpowder.</v>

191
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.990
<v 0>So we are talking about one of the most important inventions of the century so</v>

192
00:10:50.991 --> 00:10:54.170
much so that there are up to five Nobel laureates who have been awarded for the

193
00:10:54.171 --> 00:10:57.530
development and applications of lasers since 1964.

194
00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:01.430
And the applications are many and varied from barcode readers and metallurgy and

195
00:11:01.431 --> 00:11:05.480
medicine and optics or for aiming at the goalkeeper of the rival team.

196
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.160
And of course, yes.

197
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:11.150
Also to use in war haze because of its special features that you're going to

198
00:11:11.151 --> 00:11:13.550
freak out and behind it is not an ordinary man,

199
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:17.720
but possibly the best physicist of all tank Albert Einstein and his development

200
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.100
of quantum mechanics.

201
00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:28.340
But first let's talk about the laser. The laser is late normal,

202
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.490
ordinary light. Yes. Like the sun or the bathroom light and your hypes.

203
00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:35.150
But of course you're not going to use a flashlight to shoot down drones. No,

204
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.960
because that would be just silly. The laser is light. Yes,

205
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.000
but it's a very special light and physical,

206
00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:42.560
which is the language that physicists speak.

207
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.170
We see that is monochromatic coherent. And.

208
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:50.810
<v 1>Hold on a minute.</v>

209
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:54.220
<v 0>What does all this mean? Monochromatic means of a single frequency,</v>

210
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.150
a single color focused is that it does not despair us and coherent is the way

211
00:11:58.151 --> 00:11:59.620
that the waves marched to the beat.

212
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.860
That is the laser is composed of very neat light particles.

213
00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:06.660
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

214
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.510
<v 0>Perhaps the best way to understand the difference between a flashlight and the</v>

215
00:12:09.511 --> 00:12:11.490
laser beam is to compare it to an army.

216
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.700
The light of the torch would be like the army of the barbarians and gladiator

217
00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:16.860
everyone's on the room and the laser army.

218
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:19.410
We would have to imagine perfectly formed soldiers, marching,

219
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:23.310
an order synchronized running like clockwork to continue with the metaphor.

220
00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.880
It would be like the Roman army perfectly organized with everyone marching.

221
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:30.660
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

222
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:34.470
<v 0>This is thanks to the quantum properties of matter. And in particular,</v>

223
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.090
the layered structure of atoms,

224
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.870
something that could only be understood with the advent of quantum mechanics,

225
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.300
Einstein. So, and this new conception of atoms,

226
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.960
this interesting application that could only be realized over the decades after

227
00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.640
he had died in the 1960s,

228
00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.590
Unique properties,

229
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:57.180
the laser is able to concentrate a lot of energy and very little space and also

230
00:12:57.181 --> 00:13:00.210
impulses of short duration, which muscly multiplies its power.

231
00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:03.570
We're talking in the order of 10 rays to 23 Watts per centimeter,

232
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.470
Thanks to a revolutionary invention,

233
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:14.250
applied to the laser for which Mulrooney and Strickland won the Nobel prize in

234
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.073
2018.

235
00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:17.220
<v 1>With.</v>

236
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.970
<v 0>A high powered laser like this, you can easily shoot down a drill, deflect,</v>

237
00:13:20.971 --> 00:13:24.480
a missile, or even send a ship to alphas and Torah among other things.

238
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:29.490
And so we enter a new year. The age of the laser, the Sith had better watch out,

239
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.810
but as you can imagine,

240
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.510
Turkey is not the only country to have laser beam weaponry.

241
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:35.790
They're the first to have tried them in a real combat scenario.

242
00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.390
But the United States has its own weapons where they've digging too deep and

243
00:13:39.391 --> 00:13:41.700
May, 2020, while we were all confined at home.

244
00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.520
The U S Navy carried its first laser beam test. The border.

245
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.510
China is also doing its own research in this field.

246
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:53.700
So now we're going to hand the question over it to you.

247
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.950
Do you think we're looking at a new way of making war?

248
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.250
To what extent will laser beams end up replacing muscles and rifles,

249
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:02.580
and more importantly, will Turkey end up building his new Ottoman empire,
