00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.630
<v 0>Hi, I'm grant back for another video here on visual politic this week.</v>

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.040
Can the U S a B Y, and the 5g race in the bottle for 5g?

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.750
Is there even an alternative to why? Why will the USA install Japanese five G?

4
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.580
Why is there no 5g made in America?

5
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:15.523
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

6
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.220
<v 0>It's a country divided into two souls. On the one hand,</v>

7
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.840
we have the American dream, the country,

8
00:00:23.841 --> 00:00:27.890
which Thomas Jefferson dreamed of the land of freedom and opportunity.

9
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.850
No matter where you come from your life will always be better in America.

10
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:32.773
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.150
<v 0>Business terms. This has come to mean that for decades,</v>

12
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.560
Americans have been free to buy a Mercedes Toyota or Nissan just as easily as

13
00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:46.850
they bought a Chevrolet or a Ford. Now, there is another United States.

14
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.610
The United States of buy American.

15
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.160
We've seen the America in movies like grant arena.

16
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.040
Many Americans look at the label of everything. They buy,

17
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.060
hoping to find a meat and America tag before going to pay at the checkout.

18
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.220
And if there's a president who embodies this spirit, as none other than.

19
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.213
<v 1>Donald Trump.</v>

20
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.540
<v 2>Trump signs measure aimed at bolstering his by American initiative.</v>

21
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.920
<v 0>In this case,</v>

22
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.550
we are talking about an initiative to make the administration prioritize us

23
00:01:16.551 --> 00:01:18.590
products over any other.

24
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.180
But if there is one issue where by American is becoming very visible at his end,

25
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.100
the development of mobile networks, particularly with the arrival of five G.

26
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.840
So let's see how reasonable Trump's stance and his buy American position is,

27
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.550
or whether in the end,

28
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.150
the U S president will have to surrender to the necessity of trading with other

29
00:01:38.151 --> 00:01:39.350
countries. Let's take a look.

30
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.513
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

31
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.830
<v 0>Once we could say that the internet is a world without borders,</v>

32
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.310
no matter where you come from, we can all compete on an equal footing.

33
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.980
That's why I'm Scottish and presenting this. However,

34
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.130
all the internet giants come from the same place. The United.

35
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.630
<v 1>Companies.</v>

36
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.780
<v 0>Amazon, Google, and Facebook are the real Kings of the internet.</v>

37
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.140
And it seemed like the United States was going to remain the undisputed

38
00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:15.470
technological leader until the race for five G came along.

39
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.790
In case you don't know 5g as the next generation of mobile internet,

40
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.260
high speed internet,

41
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.350
which made it pretty ironic that you weren't in that quick on the uptake there,

42
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.250
the move to 5g will allow things like self-driving cars, the internet of things,

43
00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:30.140
and many other digital applications,

44
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.650
and which is the leading company and building 5g networks. It's not Google,

45
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.200
it's not Facebook. It's not even Apple.

46
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.800
The leading company in 5g technology is Huawei a Chinese company,

47
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.140
and that doesn't impress Donald Trump and the.

48
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.490
<v 2>Donald Trump declared national emergency clearing away to ban Huawei from us</v>

49
00:02:52.491 --> 00:02:53.600
5g networks.

50
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.370
<v 0>To give you all an idea while we, as a 30% worldwide market share. In fact,</v>

51
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.560
the company has deploying its 5g equipment around Europe. As you can imagine,

52
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.020
Trump does not like this one bit.

53
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.950
We will always remember his presidency for two leitmotifs America first,

54
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.020
and for his obsession with.

55
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.710
<v 3>China, China, China, China, China. I have to have my China, China, China,</v>

56
00:03:16.711 --> 00:03:21.570
because China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, that's it.

57
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.210
<v 0>5G is pretty much his worst nightmare.</v>

58
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.480
It's not just a technology where the us is far from the leader. The kicker is,

59
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:32.400
is that Shayna is winning by a country mile. However,

60
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.030
the United States cannot afford to not have 5g networks.

61
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.600
And right now doing it without Weiwei is almost impossible.

62
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.840
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

63
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.070
<v 0>While way offers the best technology and is up to 20% cheaper than any other</v>

64
00:03:47.071 --> 00:03:48.750
alternative. So the question is,

65
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.440
is it possible for the United States to turn its back on China without losing

66
00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:53.280
competitiveness,

67
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.760
will the United States be able to generate a competitive alternative to go up

68
00:03:56.761 --> 00:04:01.170
against Huawei? Can America really win the race for 5g today on visual politic?

69
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.350
We will answer those questions, but first let's look at some history.

70
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.540
<v 1>America first, not always.</v>

71
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.220
<v 0>You see, believe it or not.</v>

72
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.120
There are economic sectors in which the United States is not at the forefront.

73
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.750
The German group Volkswagen is the world's biggest selling car company from

74
00:04:18.751 --> 00:04:21.720
Mattoon. A company from friends formerly called Arriva leads.

75
00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:23.670
The field of nuclear power globally.

76
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.640
Sweden's Ikea is the leading company and the furniture sector.

77
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.210
And Spain's ACS is the world leader for international turnover in the

78
00:04:30.211 --> 00:04:34.680
construction and engineering businesses. ACS may not sound familiar to you,

79
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.550
but its president is flooding Tino Perez who I'm sure you'll be more familiar

80
00:04:38.551 --> 00:04:40.350
with as the president of Rio,

81
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.990
It goes for a mobile phone networks. Uh, note,

82
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.360
I want to make clear what we're talking about. We,

83
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.390
the consumers contract rates with telephone operators,

84
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.970
there are many operators and quite a few in each country,

85
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.510
but for our devices to work, they have to connect to mobile networks.

86
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.350
That is our devices are connected by radio waves to antennas that cover a

87
00:05:04.351 --> 00:05:05.220
certain area.

88
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.310
These facilities have base stations that have the hardware that supports

89
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.203
communications,

90
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.550
What telecommunications providers, that install 5g networks on a large scale.

91
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.500
Aren't so numerous they're Sweden's Erickson and Finland's Nakia remember them,

92
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.760
but the undisputed leader worldwide is WowWee while we has already seen more

93
00:05:26.761 --> 00:05:30.600
than 50 contracts to develop 5g and more than 30 countries,

94
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.100
the Chinese company has more 5g patents than any other company in the world.

95
00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.380
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

96
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.700
<v 0>Among its main advances.</v>

97
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.450
While we managed to complete the world's first find G call launched the first

98
00:05:45.451 --> 00:05:50.370
integral 5g base station ship and created a terminal capable of supporting

99
00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:54.000
it all. This may sound double Dutch, but as far as technology is concerned,

100
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.860
it is very important. So how did China do it? Well,

101
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.500
we've talked about it recently in this video, you know,

102
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:03.830
that China's economy is to put it mildly, quite centralized,

103
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.890
whether it's five-year plans and the communist regime has decided that

104
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:09.290
developing 5g as a top priority.

105
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.800
So they've laid out the red carpet for Huawei to investigate five G.

106
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.640
Everything has been made very easy in China for one of its telecom companies to

107
00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:20.270
become the global reference for the new generation of mobile technologies.

108
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.610
This was recently explained and the wall street journal.

109
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.610
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

110
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.390
<v 4>Holly freaked out at the wall street journal over a report that it's secured.</v>

111
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.530
It's global tech dominance on the back of 75 billion in state support from

112
00:06:35.531 --> 00:06:36.190
China.

113
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.270
<v 0>Huawei is currently the second largest mobile phone company and the world after</v>

114
00:06:40.271 --> 00:06:44.890
South Korea, Samsung more than 200 million units are sold each year. However,

115
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.860
selling smartphones is only half of their business.

116
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.400
The other half of its gigantic business is to provide the telecommunications

117
00:06:51.401 --> 00:06:54.040
equipment, the supports mobile networks,

118
00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.910
not exactly small change and all of this leads us to notice something else,

119
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.610
Erickson, Nakia, Huawei, Samsung,

120
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.000
but there is no us company that is a world leader in this business. Really.

121
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.410
It seems like in the United States,

122
00:07:05.411 --> 00:07:09.550
there is no company that has been a true telecommunications giant since Francis

123
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.580
Alcatel bought the U S brand loosened. By the way,

124
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.970
Alcatel was later acquired by Nokia. As you can see the same names,

125
00:07:15.971 --> 00:07:17.620
keep coming up over and over again.

126
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.850
So without a us company to fall back on what options does Donald Trump have left

127
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.000
for months? There has been speculation about alternatives. Volcanes.

128
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.460
There are many alternatives available to the Trump administration,

129
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.980
but two methods in particular have gained the most.

130
00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.520
Everyone was to encourage one of the us tech giants to buy out one of these

131
00:07:39.521 --> 00:07:43.930
global benchmark telecommunications companies and then jump into the 5g race.

132
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:44.740
The other,

133
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.460
and even more interventionist option would be to provide financial support to

134
00:07:48.461 --> 00:07:51.670
those bastions of the Western world that Ericsson Nakia have become.

135
00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:57.880
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

136
00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.691
<v 0>But there's no denying.</v>

137
00:07:58.691 --> 00:08:02.530
It is unthinkable that at the end of all this tune and Fruin between the

138
00:08:02.531 --> 00:08:03.820
capitalist and communist model,

139
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.880
the white house will adopt the same tactics as China.

140
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.240
Perhaps it is simply that Western economies are not in a position to replicate

141
00:08:10.241 --> 00:08:12.730
the successful model. Beijing has built with Huawei.

142
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.000
So the Trump administration has focused more on putting spokes and Weiwei's

143
00:08:16.001 --> 00:08:20.020
wheels rather than trying to win the 5g race. We all know how he did it.

144
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.140
He is banned us companies from working with Huawei. For example,

145
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:27.010
new Huawei smartphones cannot use Google apps as also trying to get other

146
00:08:27.011 --> 00:08:30.730
countries to ban Chinese technology and the deployment of 5g mobile networks

147
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.930
like in my country, Britain. But the truth is the apart from removing Australia,

148
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.530
New Zealand and Japan, few countries are heating Trump's warnings.

149
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.600
Look at what the Qatari of redo. As a note.

150
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:43.780
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

151
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.410
<v 4>Do chooses Huawei to build 5g networks in five countries.</v>

152
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.270
<v 0>My countries are Kuwait, Oman, Indonesia, Tunisia,</v>

153
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.890
and the mole deeps. Do they sound a little exotic to maybe,

154
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.880
but don't think that on the European continent it's any different Huawei knows

155
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:01.830
how to convince Western governments to it.

156
00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.470
<v 1>France authorizes the use of Huawei equipment in its 5g network while plans for</v>

157
00:09:09.471 --> 00:09:11.330
a new factory are underway.

158
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.990
<v 0>All indications are that Trump's plan a is not working,</v>

159
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:19.070
but as there a plan B that is avoiding using the same weapons as China,

160
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.440
this interventionism, that has propelled Huawei.

161
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:24.860
Is there a possibility of generating a competitive alternative to Chinese

162
00:09:24.861 --> 00:09:28.340
technology? It seems so a note, we're going to take a look at it.

163
00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:35.360
<v 1>The Rakuten revolution.</v>

164
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:36.350
<v 0>In the end,</v>

165
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.490
it seems there's a reason Trump can remain optimistic optimism and Japanese

166
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.200
translates as Rakuten.

167
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.320
I'd like to just take a moment to apologize to all of our Japanese funds there

168
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.660
I'm Scottish. I could barely speak English. As you know,

169
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.720
there's a pretty big company called Rakuten to give you an idea.

170
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.490
It's kind of like the Japanese, Amazon,

171
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:53.870
but you're probably more familiar with it.

172
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:58.490
As the main sponsor of Barcelona football club Rakuten was founded in 1997 and

173
00:09:58.491 --> 00:10:02.120
in 2004 was already the most popular company in the country.

174
00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:05.300
It has become Japan's largest e-commerce site. Again,

175
00:10:05.301 --> 00:10:09.020
making machine yen by the mountains, Fuji Yan mountains.

176
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:13.550
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

177
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.430
<v 0>Following a success at home Rakuten drag to expand internationally.</v>

178
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:20.030
And the result is nothing out of the ordinary and Spain made a million dollar

179
00:10:20.031 --> 00:10:23.210
investment, but was unable to compete with Amazon and has already closed.

180
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.280
It looked like they were coming to take over the market.

181
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.910
And in the end they didn't even manage to make some loose change. But viewers,

182
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.470
there is a Japanese proverb that says ship my one sequel, no Moto. Once again,

183
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.240
I really do apologize to Japan,

184
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.940
which means mistakes are the foundations of success.

185
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.400
So recruiting sometimes fails, but they're still trying.

186
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:42.050
And now they're diversifying.

187
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.000
They have investments in Cabify and global and in Pinterest affiliate is

188
00:10:50.001 --> 00:10:52.490
dedicated to digital banking and payment platforms,

189
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.980
records and travel for holidays, recruiting TV,

190
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.440
which has a Netflix style video on demand platform.

191
00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.770
And now I was going to tell you what they're up to, but even better.

192
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:05.210
Here's Hiroshi, Mikitani Rakuten CEO, and he is going to tell you.

193
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:11.090
<v 5>Ha going to deploy, uh, what we call mobile edge computing. And, uh,</v>

194
00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.380
in Japan, uh,

195
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:16.970
we are going to have over 4,000 it's servers all over Japan. Uh,

196
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.700
and therefore, uh, we do not,

197
00:11:19.701 --> 00:11:23.720
we have to create a new network for 5g.

198
00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:28.160
What we need to do is we modify our a server a little bit.

199
00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.730
Our core network throughput is VV fast.

200
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.810
So what we have to do is just add 5g antenna,

201
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:37.670
which we already have developed.

202
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.030
<v 0>So there you have it. Rakuten has gone into the mobile networking business,</v>

203
00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.690
but wait a minute, because we're talking about a new way to build 5g networks.

204
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:45.830
This is a virtual system.

205
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.860
The functions of mobile networks have been replicated into the cloud.

206
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:52.670
So with open hardware and 40% cheaper than traditional telecom companies,

207
00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:56.620
Rakuten says it's able to over find G with the quality and speed requirements

208
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.280
necessary.

209
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.570
And some of you will be thinking and the cloud grant leave the red pills alone.

210
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.260
This is not the matrix. Despite the fact that I'm as handsome as Morpheus,

211
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.180
you don't believe me, take a look.

212
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:16.680
<v 2>Rakuten and NEC deliver first cloud 5g unit ahead of June launch.</v>

213
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:20.070
<v 0>Because these Japanese companies are about to launch are completely</v>

214
00:12:20.071 --> 00:12:22.530
revolutionary, but above all in Trump's size,

215
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.910
it would give him a fantastic advantage. They don't come from China. Otherwise,

216
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:30.870
if he has to choose between China or Japan, Trump will choose Japan.

217
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.560
And you'll say, but what does this have to do with mate and America? Well,

218
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.450
we're going to see this right now.

219
00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:39.900
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

220
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.050
<v 2>Made in America. Well kind of.</v>

221
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.790
<v 0>This point, I think we can sell it.</v>

222
00:12:44.791 --> 00:12:49.410
The race for 5g as a clash between two systems WowWee versus record in and

223
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.680
SFA, very similar to Apple's Basel against windows.

224
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.490
I mean a struggle between what we might call an open system and a closed one,

225
00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:00.240
basically all Huawei 5g technology is owned by Huawei.

226
00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:01.890
There are hardly any other providers.

227
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.550
We are talking about a system based on very good hardware. However,

228
00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.580
Rakuten has a completely different philosophy. And this case,

229
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.830
the hardware is not that important. What's more,

230
00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.260
they can use simpler and cheaper equipment than Huawei.

231
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:18.180
And this case almost all operations are carried out by software software that

232
00:13:18.181 --> 00:13:20.910
is in the cloud. And who makes that software? Well,

233
00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:22.290
pretty much any company that.

234
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:29.380
<v 1>[Inaudible], again.</v>

235
00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:33.270
<v 0>It is something very similar to Apple versus windows. Apple is a closed system.</v>

236
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.130
You buy an Apple computer and the most,

237
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.190
the screen and all the components are manufactured by Apple.

238
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.120
In the case of windows,

239
00:13:39.121 --> 00:13:42.870
the most screen or hard drive can be from completely different manufacturers.

240
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:46.020
Well, the singles for Rakuten is five G for example,

241
00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:50.520
radio equipment is being manufactured by another Japanese company called N E C

242
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.350
N. Wait a minute. I know what you're going to say.

243
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:57.240
So how are all these Japanese companies connected to being made in America?

244
00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.340
Well, I think you can guess the answer,

245
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:03.330
many of the companies that are partnering with Rakuten are from the United

246
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.330
States. We're talking about well-known companies such as Cisco, red hat,

247
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.450
or even entail, but also some other, not so well companies,

248
00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:11.040
companies like this one.

249
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:23.100
<v 2>Altiostar raises 114 million funding round Rakuten joint says investor</v>

250
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:23.990
running.

251
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.090
<v 0>And work with components from different companies is a complicated task.</v>

252
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.000
Anyone who's tried to set up a home cinema system will tell you that, well,

253
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.870
that's the hard part because then installing it on the ground is super simple.

254
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:37.440
The activation of a rockets in base station takes only eight and a half minutes

255
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.980
compared to up to three days for a traditional base station. And you'll say, so,

256
00:14:40.981 --> 00:14:43.500
is this better or worse than Huawei? And the answer is,

257
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.490
we don't know at the moment, we can only say that in June of this year, 2020,

258
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:48.600
they're going to launch it. Okay.

259
00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:52.763
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

260
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.560
<v 0>And their rates are half of what the competition charges.</v>

261
00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:00.550
And it seems there are many more us companies willing to work with Rakuten.

262
00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.290
As you can imagine for Trump's rhetoric,

263
00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.800
this is enough to claim victory on the one hand as managed to avoid more

264
00:15:05.801 --> 00:15:07.900
business with China on the other Rakuten,

265
00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:12.340
as American enough to sell as mate an America. What's more, as you can imagine,

266
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:15.250
an attempt has already been made to claim the winner's trophy.

267
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.460
<v 6>Okay? The race to 5g is a race.</v>

268
00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.940
America must win and it's a United States.

269
00:15:21.941 --> 00:15:26.470
Our approach is private sector driven and private sector led the

270
00:15:26.471 --> 00:15:28.630
government. Doesn't have to spend lots of money.

271
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.390
<v 0>There's one thing we have to give to Trump at his tiny hands.</v>

272
00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.630
This is all good news. I mean, monopolies are bonded in any industry.

273
00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.560
The fact that viable alternatives to far ways domain are emerging as good news

274
00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:39.250
for everyone.

275
00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:43.180
The bad news is that both the United States and Japan are opting for Rakuten

276
00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:44.830
simply on a political basis.

277
00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:48.220
It would be more great if politicians used more XL and less PowerPoint,

278
00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:49.720
but this is visual politics. Here.

279
00:15:49.721 --> 00:15:52.270
We talk about what's going on and not what we'd like to happen.

280
00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.740
So now the question is over to you,

281
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.650
to what extent will the Rakuten formula be extended internationally?

282
00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.230
Do you think China will continue to win the 5g race,
