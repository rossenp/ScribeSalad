<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.860
<v 1>For years, he was the investor most feared by wall street executives,</v>

3
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.490
a tough guy with a strong inflexible character and a good head for business.

4
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.080
Over time. Carl Icahn has become one of the most important investors in history.

5
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.540
Someone who grew up in Queens in a middle-class family,

6
00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:27.380
who went to a public school yet has managed to achieve one of the 80 greatest

7
00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:29.540
fortunes in the world. To give you an idea,

8
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.560
according to Forbes his net worth his wealth exceeded the incredible figure of

9
00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:36.290
$14 billion. At the time of making this video,

10
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.620
you don't have to look any further than his own Twitter accounts to see how he

11
00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:40.550
describes himself.

12
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.960
<v 2>Some people get rich studying artificial intelligence. Me,</v>

13
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.180
I make money studying natural stupidity.

14
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.530
<v 1>Don't tell me that it's not a really clear statement of intent,</v>

15
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.650
but you know what? It's not just a matter of money with an icon,

16
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.470
but above all a matter of philosophy and style,

17
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.890
his tough Gliffy may have waned a bit these days, but for a long time,

18
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.070
icon was known for his aggressive way of operating in the markets.

19
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.970
We're talking about an activist investor who has never had any qualms,

20
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.090
even dismantling entire companies. If for him,

21
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.120
that was the best way to manage capital and make a profit.

22
00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.970
This was a strategy or way of working that as you can imagine,

23
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.470
there's never made him a lot of friends,

24
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.710
but one that has made him a source of inspiration for the media and Hollywood

25
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.450
directors. For example,

26
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.590
time magazine defined him as the real Hoff of wall street and Michael Douglas

27
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:37.100
and Richard Gere have acknowledged that the roles of Gordon gecko in the film

28
00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:40.790
wall street and Edward Lewis in pretty woman were heavily influenced by this

29
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:44.210
real life investor. And look,

30
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.970
perhaps the best example of how good icon was,

31
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.510
is by looking at his handling of trans world airlines for decades.

32
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:54.920
One of the most important airlines in the United States in 1985 icon took

33
00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:58.340
control of this airline taking on a huge debt in the project.

34
00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.390
Over the next few years,

35
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.230
he methodically sold assets of this company to get the funds he needed to return

36
00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:05.090
the money that he had borrowed an operation.

37
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.830
Very similar to the one that Gordon gecko orchestrated in the 1987 film wall

38
00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:14.540
street Friends. He may not be so well-known,

39
00:02:14.541 --> 00:02:15.860
but for the last 20 years,

40
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.070
Carl Icahn has not only managed to beat the market repeatedly,

41
00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:23.390
but his profitability has been far superior than even Warren Buffett himself.

42
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.250
But who is Carl Icahn? Really? How did he get into the world of markets?

43
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.870
How did he make his fortune?

44
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.040
What investment style did this already legendary investor use with this new

45
00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:37.230
video in the series that we are producing in conjunction with value score will

46
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:41.240
tell you, listen up the road to start them.

47
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.300
<v 0>Despite.</v>

48
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.020
<v 1>Being born into a family without any great luxuries icon was able to attend and</v>

49
00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:50.510
graduate from the prestigious Princeton university.

50
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.970
<v 2>I had no food or place to sleep,</v>

51
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.180
but in the summer I worked as a maintenance guy at some beach huts on long

52
00:02:56.181 --> 00:02:59.770
Island. I bought large amounts of AEs to sell to the customers hot days.

53
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.800
And at night I played poker with the owners. I bought three books,

54
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.410
studied the games and cleaned them out. Carl Icahn.

55
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.400
<v 1>Well, it doesn't seem like a bad start. Does it?</v>

56
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.660
Well yet it wasn't until after graduating from Princeton spending two years in

57
00:03:12.661 --> 00:03:17.040
medical school and enlisting in the military icon finally began his career on

58
00:03:17.041 --> 00:03:19.410
wall street, but let's move on because the story,

59
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.470
the real story begins in 1975

60
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.770
that's year icon was already self-employed with his right-hand man,

61
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.330
Alfred Kingsley at the time,

62
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.500
both focused on their efforts on conducting arbitration operations are ye

63
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.940
simultaneously buying and selling an asset that is traded in two or more markets

64
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.210
at different prices. Well, that's the theory, at least as you can imagine,

65
00:03:42.211 --> 00:03:44.670
the practice is usually a little more complex.

66
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.060
<v 3>Icon and his partner specialized in what is known as convertible arbitration,</v>

67
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.860
IE opening short or long positions in shares and convertible securities of the

68
00:03:55.861 --> 00:03:57.780
same companies. Simultaneously.

69
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.860
The idea was to take advantage of the small differences that for different

70
00:04:01.861 --> 00:04:04.590
reasons could be recorded in the market. However,

71
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.970
they soon expanded their range to closed investment funds. In these cases,

72
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.170
Eikon and his partner invested in the funds by buying their States at a discount

73
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.040
whilst financing those transactions by short-selling a stock portfolio

74
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.990
equivalent to the funds themselves.

75
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.170
The goal was to take advantage of the discount, the funds hat.

76
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.300
<v 1>And right here is when the two partners ask themselves a question,</v>

77
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.930
how could they make the funds close their value gap relative to the stocks they

78
00:04:30.931 --> 00:04:32.490
had in their portfolios? Well,

79
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.930
it's at this very moment that Eikon and Kingsley started behaving like activist

80
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.970
investors. Once they establish their position,

81
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.430
they began to pressure the fund managers to liquidate them.

82
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.510
I E sell all the shares and distribute the money to the funds participants this

83
00:04:45.511 --> 00:04:49.380
way, Eikon and his partner could get remarkable profits in a very short time.

84
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.570
This strategy worked, but the number of funds with which they could carry out,

85
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.870
these operations were limited. And that led them to a new thought.

86
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.120
<v 2>If we can be activists in a closed and undervalued investment fund,</v>

87
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.510
why can't we be activists in a corporation with undervalued assets,

88
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:07.403
Alfred Kingsley.

89
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.050
<v 1>That's the new strategy they put into place in 1975.</v>

90
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.250
And their timing was also ideal. You see, after a decade of stagflation,

91
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.980
a crisis in the oil market and a languishing economy,

92
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:24.660
1974 was the worst year in North American markets. Since the great depression,

93
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.580
since the peak of 1973,

94
00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.760
the us stock exchange has lost 45% of its value.

95
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.940
This caused many shares to be clearly undervalued with trading levels.

96
00:05:32.941 --> 00:05:34.620
Well below the asset value itself.

97
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.900
<v 2>In our view,</v>

98
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.440
the elements of today's economic environment have been uniquely combined to

99
00:05:40.441 --> 00:05:43.500
create great benefit opportunities with relatively little risk,

100
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.430
the real or liquidation value of many us companies has increased markedly in

101
00:05:47.431 --> 00:05:49.890
recent years. However, and this is what is interesting.

102
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.100
It has not been fully reflected in the market value of the shares,

103
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.080
Carl Icahn and an investor's memo.

104
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.180
<v 1>Now how I con choose his investments,</v>

105
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.780
what was the method that pushed him to the top of the investment world? Well.

106
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.100
<v 0>The corporate assault.</v>

107
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.860
<v 1>Our protagonist in this video made his fortune as something like a corporate</v>

108
00:06:11.861 --> 00:06:12.250
Raider.

109
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.730
He would buy a major stake in a company and then try to force management to make

110
00:06:15.731 --> 00:06:18.100
certain decisions that will cause the share price to increase.

111
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.220
This used all kinds of strategies, media pressure,

112
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.300
active searches for potential buyers, disinvestment plans, power struggles,

113
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:29.590
et cetera. Take a look at this.

114
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.810
<v 0>From our.</v>

115
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:32.410
<v 1>Perspective,</v>

116
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.070
we believe the great profits can be made by taking a long positions in

117
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.520
undervalued actions and then trying to control the fates of companies,

118
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.170
but the following actions, Hey,

119
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.220
trying to convince management to liquidate or sell the company to a white

120
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.680
Knight, be provoking a power struggle,

121
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.600
see making a purchase offer D reselling our position to the company.

122
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.400
<v 0>This.</v>

123
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.820
<v 1>Is what writer Mark Stevens called the icon manifesto.</v>

124
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.280
As you can see in the eyes of this investor,

125
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.880
what are the biggest difficulties facing shareholders is the one known as the

126
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.430
agency problem, a well-known problem in financial theory,

127
00:07:06.431 --> 00:07:07.840
for those of you who don't know what it means,

128
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.530
it's that the managers of the companies usually have different objectives than

129
00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:15.100
the shareholders in that the managers do not know much about maximizing the

130
00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:15.934
value for the land.

131
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:18.940
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

132
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.650
<v 1>Leading activism campaigns.</v>

133
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.460
If you're strong enough was something that could generate significant returns.

134
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.610
Of course, before we get carried away in this excitement of board room,

135
00:07:27.611 --> 00:07:31.180
powerplays keep in mind that these kinds of campaigns also had a much more

136
00:07:31.181 --> 00:07:32.230
controversial site.

137
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.050
<v 3>Many of these activism operations ended with a practice that is now banned.</v>

138
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.560
It was known as green male or business black male, uh,

139
00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:45.820
financial practice consisting of the following after unleashing a power struggle

140
00:07:45.821 --> 00:07:48.370
and a media campaign for control of the company,

141
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.840
e-comm negotiated the sale of its shares to the company itself in exchange for a

142
00:07:52.841 --> 00:07:53.920
generous premium.

143
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.500
<v 1>In this way,</v>

144
00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.340
the executives managed to save their heads and got to the annoying icon out of

145
00:08:00.341 --> 00:08:02.530
their way. Of course, those who paid the price,

146
00:08:02.531 --> 00:08:03.970
where the rest of the shareholders.

147
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.340
<v 0>We.</v>

148
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.760
<v 1>Are talking about the practice that Warren Buffett himself came to describe as</v>

149
00:08:09.761 --> 00:08:12.190
hateful and disgusting of course, to be fair.

150
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.130
The fact that like Tom was able to close numerous such agreements,

151
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.920
says very little of the integrity of the managers themselves.

152
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.340
Of course not all operations ended this way. One of the best known examples.

153
00:08:21.341 --> 00:08:22.630
And at the same time,

154
00:08:22.631 --> 00:08:26.440
one of the first operations that made a name for this investor was his handling

155
00:08:26.441 --> 00:08:28.120
of the Tappan stove company,

156
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.020
a manufacturer of ovens and stoves that was going for a rough patch by Collin

157
00:08:32.021 --> 00:08:35.560
gradually bought a larger and larger stake. And when he had enough weight,

158
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:37.360
you got to seat on the board of directors.

159
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.470
And from there he promoted the sale of non-strategic assets and tried by all

160
00:08:41.471 --> 00:08:43.720
means possible to find a buyer for the company.

161
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.320
So can you guess how it all ended? Well, look,

162
00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:51.730
I can't began investing in 1977 when the shares were traded at around

163
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.770
$8 just two years later. And thanks in large parts to icons, maneuvers,

164
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.910
Belgian manufacturer,

165
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.470
and lecturer Luxe ended up paying $18 for each share that is he more than

166
00:09:01.471 --> 00:09:03.750
doubled his investment in just over two years?

167
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.600
I don't think that this was an isolated case in the table below.

168
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.610
You can see some of his most lucrative options,

169
00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.830
The height of his career in the 1980s,

170
00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.370
I can control billions in capital and caused real dread.

171
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.770
Even among executives of the large corporations in the American stocks,

172
00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.560
Campaigns have continued up to this day. For example, in 2019,

173
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:33.980
he launched a public campaign against the board of directors of Occidental

174
00:09:33.981 --> 00:09:37.520
petroleum for an agreement that they had reached with Warren buffet.

175
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:41.030
Another well-known recent example was his role in pressuring Apple to launch

176
00:09:41.031 --> 00:09:44.480
what may have been the largest share, buy back program in history.

177
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.200
It made no sense to this investor that the Cupertino based company should

178
00:09:48.201 --> 00:09:50.630
accumulate tens and tens of billions of dollars a year.

179
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:51.493
<v 0>Cash.</v>

180
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.970
<v 1>One question that comes up is,</v>

181
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:59.000
but how does he decide in which companies to invest well,

182
00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.150
although he's not exactly known for being a value investor.

183
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.450
The truth is that if we study everything on a case by case basis,

184
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.600
icon has almost always followed Benjamin Graham's thesis.

185
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.470
The majority of his operations have centered on companies that for various

186
00:10:15.471 --> 00:10:19.550
reasons seems to be trading at a huge discount with respect to their intrinsic

187
00:10:19.551 --> 00:10:20.030
value.

188
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.120
His role was then to drive enough corporate changes for that hidden value to

189
00:10:23.121 --> 00:10:26.240
emerge, even if it meant liquidating the company itself.

190
00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:27.470
And the idea that Graham,

191
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:31.280
the father of value investing himself defended on numerous occasions.

192
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:33.650
<v 0>Anyway, this story.</v>

193
00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.490
<v 1>Of call icon, one of the great investors of all time, an atypical investor,</v>

194
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.190
who of course has also made huge mistakes.

195
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.940
Some as well-known as blockbuster Yahoo or more recently,

196
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:47.060
herps a company that we covered not long ago in this video.

197
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.600
And that has cost this investor more than 1.5 billion.
