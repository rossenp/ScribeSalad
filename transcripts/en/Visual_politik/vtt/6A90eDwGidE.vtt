00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.690
<v 1>The digital world is in complete turmoil, right? As we speak,</v>

3
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.750
there are great business and even political battles going on.

4
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.920
Great battles whose outcome will redefine the world of digital services in the

5
00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:21.290
years to come the most well-known of these Wars.

6
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.040
The one that is the most talks about is undoubtedly, the streaming.

7
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.640
It is by no means the only one. And this video,

8
00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:35.060
we will take a look at a new war that has been declared in 2020,

9
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.440
that of the application stores, a new battlefield that as you will see,

10
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.430
also impacts the movement of astronomical figures and may have a considerable

11
00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:45.290
impact on the way we relate to tech.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.963
<v 0>A wall.</v>

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.730
the most valuable company in the world with a market value of over $2 trillion

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.600

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.300

<v 1>This is in 2020,</v>

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.870
the us house of representatives judiciary subcommittee on anti-trust commercial

22
00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:25.190
and administrative law has put Apple dead in his sights in its last report

23
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.110
published in early October, 2020.

24
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.620
It denounced the Apple company for monopolistic practices in relation to its

25
00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:31.910
applications business.

26
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.370
<v 0>No.</v>

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.520
<v 1>That's not all during the month of August Epic games,</v>

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.840

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.090
not just popular from the social phenomenon that the game Fortnite has become

31
00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:49.640
decided to launch the battle against Apple. First,

32
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.600
as we will see by ignoring Apple's rules and then directly in the court.

33
00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.280
<v 0>They end up alone.</v>

34
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.040
<v 1>Epic games has partnered with 12 other digital companies,</v>

35
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.960
including Spotify and match group,

36
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.950
the parent company of the popular app Tinder to create the coalition for app

37
00:02:06.951 --> 00:02:10.880
fairness, a platform whose goal is to expose the alleged abusers.

38
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.440
Apple is committing with its app store and to call for public regulation to end

39
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:19.160
these hypothetical monopolistic practices. In addition, technological giants,

40
00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:21.110
such as Microsoft, Facebook and Google,

41
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.740
although not part of this coalition have shown their support for it in one way

42
00:02:24.741 --> 00:02:25.340
or another.

43
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.850
And all of them are also under scrutiny from the very same subcommittee

44
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.710
That's taking all of this into account.

45
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.050
What implications could all these attacks have?

46
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.720
Why has such a battle broken out in the technology industry,

47
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.590
our app store so important? What could all this mean for Apple?

48
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.610
What risks does it face in this new video that we've made in collaboration with

49
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:49.460
value score? We will try to answer all of these questions.

50
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.090
And the first thing that we need to do is understand exactly what we're talking

51
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:55.880
about and just how huge it is. So that's good.

<v 1>During the first nine months of the year alone,</v>

Apple shares have increased in value by 56%.

59
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.660
This led the company to surpassed the 2 trillion stock market valuation.

62
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:28.620
investment in Apple amounts to,

63
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.130
you might want to hold onto your chair more than $80 billion.

64
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.820
Berkshire Hathaway has more than tripled its investment in Apple and less than

65
00:03:35.821 --> 00:03:37.170
five years. And do you know what?

66
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.280
To a large extent this impressive evolution has been due to the good performance

67
00:03:41.281 --> 00:03:42.420
of its services division.

68
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.880
<v 0>You.</v>

69
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.630
<v 1>See Apple services division made up of businesses, such as the app store,</v>

70
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.390
iCloud, Apple music, Apple care, Apple pay,

71
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.050
Apple arcade and Apple TV plus is becoming the company's spearhead.

72
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.130
The driving force with which Cupertino aspires to maintain its growth rates.

73
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.720
We are talking about a division with a turnover at 12 months at already exceeds

74
00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:08.040
$50 billion, almost 20% of all Apple's revenue. However,

75
00:04:08.041 --> 00:04:10.650
the services have two major advantages. Firstly,

76
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.650
they are recurring income without strong quarterly fluctuations,

77
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.280
which makes them more predictable and not vulnerable to the better or worse

78
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.460
performance of the launch of some new stock product. Secondly,

79
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.260
the margins are much higher.

80
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.490
It's gross margin is over 60% compared to just over 30% in the hardware

81
00:04:26.491 --> 00:04:27.750
business. In other words,

82
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.110
although services still only account for around 20% of all revenue,

83
00:04:31.111 --> 00:04:35.100
their contribution to profits is much higher, far exceeding 30%.

84
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.170
No because the service division,

85
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.010
unlike products such as the iPhone or iPad maintains considerably high growth

86
00:04:44.011 --> 00:04:45.960
rates since 2014, for example,

87
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.320
it has recorded an average annual growth of over 18%.

88
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.560
We are talking about more than 550 million paid subscriptions to Apple services.

89
00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.780
And the forecasts are optimistic.

90
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.890
This services division is expected to achieve a turnover of just over $80

91
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.890
billion by 2025, which means that in terms of profits,

92
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.100
this division could bring Apple about half of audit's corporate profits.

93
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.270
<v 0>Fact.</v>

94
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.430
<v 1>It's the confidence in these forecasts that largely explains the good</v>

95
00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:23.670
performance that Apple has had in the stock market over the last two years,

96
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.470
that it's P E R or the price earnings ratio at which it shares a quoted has

97
00:05:28.471 --> 00:05:32.520
increased almost threefold and that some analysis firms such as Wedbush

98
00:05:32.521 --> 00:05:36.630
securities value the services division alone at over $700 billion.

99
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.770
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

100
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:42.630
<v 1>Store is the core business of this entire division.</v>

101
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.360
According to existing estimates during the last fiscal year,

102
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.920
one out of every $3 Apple build in services was done through the app store.

103
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.240
We are talking about an annual turnover of just over $15 billion with very high

104
00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:57.120
margins, perhaps even above 70%,

105
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.610
You can imagine the implications, the consequences that Apple could suffer.

106
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.730
If the regulator were to cutoff or restrict this source of profit.

107
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.570
Now having said that at the market level, just how big is the app store?

108
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.820
Why have complaints about it grown so much? Listen up.

109
00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.580
<v 0>Dean changing model.</v>

110
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.240
<v 1>The appearance of the iPhone was a huge change,</v>

111
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.150
a revolution in the world of telecommunications,

112
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.010
but unlike what is commonly thought,

113
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.040
the biggest paradigm shift did not come from the touch screen,

114
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.490
but mostly from the way the software worked and specifically from the

115
00:06:33.491 --> 00:06:34.600
development of the app.

116
00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:39.070
<v 0>The system [inaudible].</v>

117
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.600
<v 1>Apple had a very ingenious idea to make it software available to thousands and</v>

118
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.380
thousands of developers so that they could create apps of all kinds of apps that

119
00:06:47.381 --> 00:06:50.500
would have to strictly comply with the requirements set by Apple.

120
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.370
And that would work in a sandbox environment that is in an isolated system,

121
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.630
which would guarantee that they are.

122
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.463
<v 0>Safe apps.</v>

123
00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.290
<v 1>In the iOS environment.</v>

124
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.890
Applications cannot ask the user for permission to execute dangerous actions.

125
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.100
They cannot install malware viruses or any other harmful elements,

126
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.370
and they cannot execute structural or security changes in the phone's

127
00:07:09.371 --> 00:07:10.840
configuration. And that's not all,

128
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.380
all these apps are distributed exclusively from the app store itself.

129
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.750
This means that if they offer services with a cost,

130
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.220
these are paid for through Apple.

131
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.980
That means an application cannot persuade you for example,

132
00:07:20.981 --> 00:07:22.840
to share your credit card with it. In addition,

133
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.130
installation and updates are very simple operations where users practically do.

134
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.170
<v 0>Nothing by the way.</v>

135
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.510
<v 1>When Google developed its own store,</v>

136
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.350
it opted for a freer model and that has given them a lot of headaches due to the

137
00:07:38.351 --> 00:07:41.380
security flaws. These days, all this violence seem a bit normal to us,

138
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.630
but think of the change it represented at the time,

139
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.380
suddenly thousands and thousands of companies and developers began to create

140
00:07:47.381 --> 00:07:50.860
applications and set up businesses based on this new form of interaction with

141
00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:51.694
customers.

142
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.113
<v 0>[Inaudible] at the same time.</v>

143
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.270
<v 1>Hi customers could not only do a thousand new things with their phones,</v>

144
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.570
but also do them safely. This favored the small creators in particular.

145
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.360
Now they no longer had to gain the trust of customers to think that they were

146
00:08:04.361 --> 00:08:05.110
safe apps.

147
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.800
They only had to worry about providing good service and competing head-to-head

148
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:09.820
with the biggest players in.

149
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.200
<v 0>The industry. However.</v>

150
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.510
<v 1>In exchange for this entire distribution chain,</v>

151
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.200
Apple keeps a percentage of the sales made through the app store commission that

152
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:21.910
in the case of digital services,

153
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.710
because physical products and services do not count ranges from 15 to 30%,

154
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.280
what needs to be highlighted here is that these charges are in line with what

155
00:08:30.281 --> 00:08:32.500
the rest of the platforms of this type charge.

156
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.370
But it's not just about the commission.

157
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.330
Apple also sets the rules and decides who is in and who is not.

158
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.450
And if you're not in the app store, you're simply out of the iOS world.

159
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.840
The fact is that this model caused a whole software explosion today.

160
00:08:46.841 --> 00:08:49.240
The app store has almost 2 million applications,

161
00:08:49.241 --> 00:08:53.470
500 million weekly users and sales of more than 50 billion each year, of which,

162
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.290
as we have seen some $15 go to Apple as a sales guy,

163
00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.110
Friends, the app store may not seem that significant,

164
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.670
but you can see that it is no joke. It's a gigantic distribution business.

165
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.520
And it's the biggest app store in the world every year.

166
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.820
It makes almost twice as much as Google play the Google store.

167
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:20.360
An idea of the industry that has been created according to Apple data,

168
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:21.470
since 2008,

169
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:26.300
it has paid developers more than $155 billion. On the other hand,

170
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.000
according to a study by the consulting firm analysis group,

171
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:34.100
app store applications were responsible for a total turnover of 519 billion in

172
00:09:34.101 --> 00:09:37.520
2019. If we take into account all the physical products, services,

173
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.700
and digital goods that were sold through these applications from travel

174
00:09:40.701 --> 00:09:44.600
reservations, to the purchase of mobile games, to video platform, subscriptions,

175
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:48.890
food sales, or Uber trips. If you have an iPhone, you may never have noticed it,

176
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.830
but the app store is a fierce business powerhouse.

177
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:56.150
I'll repeat that figure $519 billion in

178
00:09:56.151 --> 00:10:00.170
2019 alone. If you're a developer and you're not in this store, well,

179
00:10:00.171 --> 00:10:04.700
your business might have a problem. So in a nutshell,

180
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:08.510
you can see it as one of the driving forces of Apple's takeoff. However,

181
00:10:08.511 --> 00:10:12.380
it seems this huge business could now be at risk, at least in part. Well,

182
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.030
why let's take a look?

183
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.080
<v 2>Anti trust alert.</v>

184
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:20.803
<v 0>Friends.</v>

185
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:21.650
<v 1>Still was a revolution,</v>

186
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:25.370
but now it faces the scrutiny of both the United States Congress and the

187
00:10:25.371 --> 00:10:28.130
European commission. Well, let's start with the United States.

188
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:30.530
<v 0>In this.</v>

189
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:31.010
<v 1>Country,</v>

190
00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:34.760
the judicial sub-committee of the United States house of representatives on

191
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.600
anti-trust commercial and administrative law has been investigating the large

192
00:10:38.601 --> 00:10:41.900
tech companies for some time for alleged monopolistic practices.

193
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:43.820
And after 16 months of investigations,

194
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.630
this subcommittee presented its latest report. In early October, 2020,

195
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:55.400
Apple has monopolistic power over the distribution of software on iPhones that

196
00:10:55.401 --> 00:10:56.570
is with the app store.

197
00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:00.650
This would apparently allow Cupertino's company to gain extraordinary benefits.

198
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.160
Use the information gathered to carry out unfair competition actions and to

199
00:11:04.161 --> 00:11:07.760
prioritize its own software solutions against the competition.

200
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.143
<v 0>According to this.</v>

201
00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:14.690
<v 1>Although it is true that there is competition in the smartphone industry,</v>

202
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.100
given that iOS dominates the U S market and platform jumps on not frequent in

203
00:11:19.101 --> 00:11:23.570
its opinion, the IMS universe must be considered as a market in itself.

204
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.760
<v 2>Apple's market power is enduring due to high switching costs,</v>

205
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:29.930
ecosystem blockage,

206
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.650
and brand loyalty report of the judicial sub-committee of the us house of

207
00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:37.010
representatives of antitrust commercial and administrative law.

208
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:44.030
<v 1>There. Of course, the app store has a monopoly because unlike Google,</v>

209
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:48.340
Apple does not allow other application stores to be installed on its devices.

210
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.980
<v 0>But that's not all the legislators have.</v>

211
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.550
<v 1>Also presented some recommendations that will now have to be reviewed by the</v>

212
00:11:57.551 --> 00:12:01.300
members of Congress recommendations that range from forcing Apple to accept

213
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:02.081
other app stores,

214
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:06.040
to establishing the rules of the game by law or prohibiting the owner of the

215
00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:08.380
platform from giving priority to its apps.

216
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:12.130
There is even the possibility of prohibiting platform owners from operating in

217
00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:15.160
certain lines of business in which they can benefit from the information

218
00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:17.830
generated from transactions made in the app store itself.

219
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:25.020
It may all come to little or nothing, but the risk is there.

220
00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:28.560
Keep in mind that the investigations of this committee have already been used in

221
00:12:28.561 --> 00:12:31.960
the condemnation that Microsoft received at the beginning of the century for

222
00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:32.963
minute.

223
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.460
<v 0>Conviction.</v>

224
00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:40.830
<v 1>That forced the company to break the links between the windows business and its</v>

225
00:12:40.831 --> 00:12:43.650
software business. And it's not just the United States.

226
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.130
The European commission has started its own crusade against apples,

227
00:12:47.131 --> 00:12:49.440
alleged monopolistic practices. In this case,

228
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.080
it has two different services in its sites. On the one hand,

229
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.140
the app store and on the other, the Apple pay service and friends,

230
00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.670
when it comes to the European commission,

231
00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.460
it would not be unusual if all this leads to heavy fines.

232
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.510
And as if all of this weren't enough.

233
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:10.410
Now these two fronts have been joined by the coalition for app fairness led by

234
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.550
Epic games at Spotify who are asking to be able to compete with other app stores

235
00:13:14.551 --> 00:13:19.350
directly that is not having to pay the 30% commission and not being subject to

236
00:13:19.351 --> 00:13:20.184
Apple's rules.

237
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:21.043
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

238
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.560
<v 1>The battle began in August, 2020 when Epic games introduced its popular game,</v>

239
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:29.250
Fortnite,

240
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:33.000
the option to buy without going through Apple and therefore without paying the

241
00:13:33.001 --> 00:13:36.390
30% commission that made Apple with Royal fortnight from its platform and

242
00:13:36.391 --> 00:13:38.070
started an intense legal battle.

243
00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:43.500
<v 0>So there you have it.</v>

244
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.560
<v 1>Free battle lines drawn on one of Apple's most lucrative businesses,</v>

245
00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.050
and it's not just the Cupertino company that's at risk.

246
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.750
If the authorities were to interfere with this business model,

247
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.240
other platforms could also run into tribal. For example,

248
00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:58.500
the Xbox Nintendo or PlayStation video game platforms that work in a very

249
00:13:58.501 --> 00:13:59.334
similar way.

250
00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:03.630
<v 0>In short.</v>

251
00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.990
<v 1>This is another of the great Wars that have begun to be fought in the world of</v>

252
00:14:06.991 --> 00:14:10.830
digital services. In this case, the impact on Apple could be considerable,

253
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.100
not so gigantic or decisive one, but a significant one.

254
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.860
You've already seen how lucrative this type of business can be.

255
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.530
But now it's your turn. What do you think about all of this?

256
00:14:19.531 --> 00:14:22.440
Do you think that we should put limits on big technology companies or should we

257
00:14:22.441 --> 00:14:24.300
just let each company set the standards?

258
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.910
It believes are best within its own services.
