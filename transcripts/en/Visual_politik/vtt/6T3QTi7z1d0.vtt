1
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.800
<v 1>So my visual politic and Migos, Tanzania is in the news for two reasons. Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.070
that's right. You have this Tanzania and there's one good reason.

3
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.780
And then there's one bad one.

4
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.020
The good news is this East African country is holding presidential and

5
00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:29.900
parliamentary elections when October 28th and election,

6
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.560
that could end the ring of John [inaudible] president of the country since he

7
00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:35.810
won elections in 2015.

8
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.650
But the bad news is that his presidency has been a steamroller over the rights

9
00:00:39.651 --> 00:00:42.230
and freedoms that previously existed in Tanzania.

10
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.350
We are talking about extreme violence against opponents,

11
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.790
strong political oppression,

12
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.150
and limited freedom of expression for anything other than praise and

13
00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:54.110
commendations for the current president. So as you might be able to imagine,

14
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.070
this is something that makes us doubt that we are going to see fair and true

15
00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.820
elections.

16
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.600
It seems likely that there'll be rigged in some way while mega fooly is in

17
00:01:02.601 --> 00:01:06.710
power. I'm sorry to say, but the truth is that in this case we are pessimistic.

18
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.080
And although we don't know what will happen in the near future,

19
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.610
we can pretty much imagine it.

20
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.080
The case.

21
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.710
What we do know is that the political instability caused by mega foully has also

22
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:26.420
had economic consequences and take note, because this is important. Yes, yes.

23
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.620
Some of you may be thinking Tanzania, but what you seem to run. I mean, come on.

24
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.970
What did you expect? But here you may be skeptical, but we visual politic.

25
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.840
We actually like to be optimistic and I'm aware that it's 20,

26
00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:42.050
20 and optimism has been canceled, but we do try.

27
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.770
And the truth is that in this case, there are many reasons to be optimistic.

28
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.110
The 21st century started well for Tanzania.

29
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.360
With many years of strong economic growth,

30
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.960
the country was situated in the band of countries that make up the so-called new

31
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.070
African awakening.

32
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.090
We've already talked about in other videos about Ethiopia of Rwanda. However,

33
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.590
since Micah fully came to power,

34
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.310
it seems not Tanzania is not doing so well anymore.

35
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.340
It's all gone downhill so badly, but the IMF questions,

36
00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:10.190
the economic growth figures provided by the government.

37
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.760
So the question today is why has the political situation in Tanzania

38
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.510
deteriorated so much are the suspicions about the figures provided by the

39
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:19.880
government justified today on visual politic,

40
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.380
we are going to answer these questions,

41
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.240
but first let's take a look at some history.

42
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.530
<v 0>African socialism.</v>

43
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.940
<v 1>They have heard of places like Dar ES Salaam, Tonga, Tanganyika, or Zanzibar.</v>

44
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.080
So I suggest you take note because the historical nuances are very interesting.

45
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.950
Again with Tanzania is the union of two States that had once been independent to

46
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.020
tango Yuca and Zanzibar Tanga.

47
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.660
Yoga is the name of one of the most important leaks in the world,

48
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.250
lik Tanganyika. But when we referred the Republic of [inaudible],

49
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.500
we mean the current continental Tanzania,

50
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.160
Tanzania is located on the African continent between Lake Tanganyika and the

51
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:10.780
Indian ocean Zanzibar is an archipelago on the same ocean formed by several

52
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:11.830
islands and islands.

53
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.710
You can't talk about Tanzania without talking about the great European explorers

54
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.490
of Africa,

55
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.300
the famous meeting between Henry Stanley and Dr. Livingston took place in the

56
00:03:24.301 --> 00:03:26.130
interior of this very company,

57
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.300
But it was not the first time that European had visited these lands.

58
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.050
The Europeans had already been going to Zanzibar centuries before until the

59
00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:39.840
Sultan of Oman threw them out. At that time,

60
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.950
the Omanis dominated the entire Indian ocean coast from a man to Madagascar.

61
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.590
This was so much of their territory, but in the 18th century,

62
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.320
the Sultan moved his capital from a man to Zanzibar.

63
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.280
The problem was that his children got along worse than Scottish people did with

64
00:03:53.281 --> 00:03:57.210
English ones or Scottish people with American ones or squash people with French

65
00:03:57.211 --> 00:03:57.600
ones.

66
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.510
Basically I'm saying Scottish people are grumpy and saw where the salt tans

67
00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:00.930
kids.

68
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.560
So one branch of the family inherited the salt in it of Zanzibar and probably

69
00:04:04.561 --> 00:04:07.890
cut off ties with our relatives and this way, the Sultan,

70
00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:12.150
it was fully independent for more than three decades until surprise surprise.

71
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.880
The British empire took over by the way,

72
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.990
this CELTA Nate also owned the entire East coast of the African continent.

73
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.010
So you can see why the most important city in Tanzania is called Dar ES Salaam.

74
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.620
It was an exemplary country until a few years ago,

75
00:04:25.621 --> 00:04:28.020
in terms of religious coexistence. Nevertheless,

76
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.510
Christianity still has a strong presence. There sometimes even an exaggerated.

77
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.590
<v 2>His leader urges people to worship and throngs against Corona virus.</v>

78
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.510
President John Mughal, fooly scorned,

79
00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:44.100
social distancing sees Jesus Christ is antidote to say Titanic virus,

80
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.420
wall street journal. Meanwhile.

81
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:46.620
<v 1>Mainland Tanzania,</v>

82
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.040
it was colonized by the Germans and then became a British protectorate.

83
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.450
This was the case until 1961, the year Tanganyika gained independence.

84
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.100
And then two years later in 1963 came the independence of Zanzibar.

85
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.880
But my friends, the situations were very, very different.

86
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.480
Well, Tanganyika was a multi-party Republic during the first year,

87
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.620
Zanzibar returned to the hands of the Sultan and a powerful ruling Arab elite.

88
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.970
However, the independence CELTA nature of Zanzibar lasted only one month.

89
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.900
Our revolution broke out almost immediately deposing the Sultan and founding the

90
00:05:21.901 --> 00:05:24.990
people's Republic of Zanzibar. And as you can imagine,

91
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.560
that people's doesn't exactly always mean freedom.

92
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.730
The country was about to become yet another experiment with communism. However,

93
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.420
it's president Abby pyramid. Although I left when type was more moderate,

94
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.840
he didn't want a communist dictatorship and find the formula to avoid it.

95
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.310
Uniting Zanzibar with Tonga Zika, to form a new country, Tanzania, to do this.

96
00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:47.370
He had to get along with the man considered to be the father of the Tanzania

97
00:05:47.371 --> 00:05:51.480
nation, Julius NARI, a professor, and the architect of African socialism.

98
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.900
Someone who had a very unusual concept of democracy.

99
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.920
<v 2>Democracy is not a bottle Coca-Cola,</v>

100
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.260
which you can import democracy should develop.

101
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.960
According to that particular country, I never went to a country,

102
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.280
saw a lot of parties and assumed that it is democratic Julius. [inaudible].

103
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.410
<v 1>Starting point,</v>

104
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.380
as you can perhaps imagine Newbury and to remiss shear to the power,

105
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.360
they reached a clear and simple agreement.

106
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.990
Newberry would be president of Tanzania and Karimi is vice-president.

107
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.750
And addition Karimi would also be the president of Zanzibar,

108
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.730
which was becoming a semi-autonomous region.

109
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.830
That was the pact by my friend's nefarious plans for the new Tanzania didn't end

110
00:06:26.831 --> 00:06:28.360
there. And it must be said,

111
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.600
but the result was not very different from what had been planned for Zanzibar,

112
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.270
but that had come a boat as he promised,

113
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.790
without aligning himself with the Soviet union.

114
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.860
Well, the fact is the African socialism marks Tanzania's first two decades.

115
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.490
Numerai declared a one-party state nationalized companies and factories and

116
00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:52.240
forced 11 million peasants to work on collective farms by force burning their

117
00:06:52.241 --> 00:06:55.060
homes to keep them from returning as is often the case.

118
00:06:55.061 --> 00:06:57.760
When you force people who have no idea what they're doing to work in the fields,

119
00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.620
these farms were a complete failure.

120
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.950
The result was a massive famine and despite Tanzania's enormous potential,

121
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.600
there was real economic chaos.

122
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.493
And at that time,

123
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.740
loons from the international monetary fund helped that country get out of the

124
00:07:11.741 --> 00:07:15.460
situation, but as always with a bunk, the fund set conditions,

125
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.040
and for once they didn't ask for anything particularly controversial,

126
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.980
the country basically had to open up to the free market.

127
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.760
This was a change that [inaudible] did not want to accept. So in 1985,

128
00:07:24.761 --> 00:07:28.270
he understood that his team has precedent with over at the age of 63,

129
00:07:28.271 --> 00:07:30.490
he retired and went home. Undoubtedly,

130
00:07:30.491 --> 00:07:33.010
one of the best decisions of his entire political career

131
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.760
It's voluntary departure allowed to changes to come to the country in 1994,

132
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.310
multi-party democracy was restored in Tanzania.

133
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.180
And my friends Tanzania has since become one of Africa's favorite countries for

134
00:07:46.181 --> 00:07:48.190
investors as state control over the economy,

135
00:07:48.191 --> 00:07:52.210
relaxed investment began to rule and Tanzania attracted direct foreign

136
00:07:52.211 --> 00:07:54.910
investment that accounted for 4% of its GDP annually,

137
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.280
not an inconsiderable figure for decades.

138
00:07:57.281 --> 00:08:00.670
The United Kingdom in the United States were the main investors until recently,

139
00:08:00.671 --> 00:08:03.100
of course, when everything changed.

140
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.420
<v 2>China emerges Tanzania's major investor ventures. Africa.</v>

141
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.000
<v 1>The point is that regardless of where the money comes from,</v>

142
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:11.890
all this investment has had consequences.

143
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.090
Tanzania's economic situation has improved and is per capita income has doubled

144
00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.300
so far the century, moreover, as you can see in this graph,

145
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.060
Tanzania's annual GDP growth has not stopped increasing.

146
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.180
And over the last 20 years has been about 4% per year,

147
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.800
indeed Tanzania's economy.

148
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:29.320
It was performing better than that of Sub-Saharan Africa.

149
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.680
And so it seemed that things were slowly getting better and a country that was

150
00:08:32.681 --> 00:08:37.060
perhaps destined to become one of Africa's great hopes and you know what

151
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.740
everything was looking great until Magufuli the current president came to power

152
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.240
because my friends with his arrival, everything changed. Check this out.

153
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.740
<v 0>The Tanzanian bulldozer.</v>

154
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.250
<v 1>Mega fooly is known as the bill dozer,</v>

155
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.610
a nickname errands during his time as minister of public works.

156
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.480
But the truth is that this name is also a fitting description of his team as

157
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:09.840
president. Although in this case for different reasons,

158
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.980
some better and some worse, for example,

159
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.770
he inaugurated his presidency by cracking down on corruption.

160
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.830
He removed 10,000 ghost workers from the public payroll,

161
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:24.000
Phantom workers who caused the country $2 million every month.

162
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.870
Then another value celebrated move was to integrate an Al Bino into his cabinet.

163
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:28.710
Since in Africa,

164
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:32.400
there are many prejudices against albinos and they are persecuted by local

165
00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:36.600
witchdoctors, but friends of visual politics don't get too excited.

166
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.900
That is pretty much the extent of [inaudible] successes.

167
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.370
And his entire five years.

168
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:42.463
<v 0>We do.</v>

169
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.920
<v 1>The president of Tanzania has ruled impulsively without thinking about the</v>

170
00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:51.410
consequences of each of his measures. For example,

171
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.320
first he proposed that secondary education be free,

172
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.200
which may sound at first to be very good. However,

173
00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:00.590
the immediate consequence was problematic as the schools filled up and the

174
00:10:00.591 --> 00:10:02.240
situation got out of control.

175
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:06.230
It's easy to promise something if you don't have the resources watch out because

176
00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:08.540
the cure can be worse than the disease.

177
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:12.890
And that is not all the situation of the Tanzania educational system was

178
00:10:12.891 --> 00:10:17.030
definitely affected when Micah fully decreed to the expulsion of all foreign

179
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.360
workers without proper permits at the national level,

180
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:25.190
this measure expelled thousands of Kenyans who'd been working as teachers.

181
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.730
Therefore the final outcome was doubly terrible, more students,

182
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.390
fewer private and subsidized schools and fewer teachers. In other words,

183
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.880
overcoded classes and poor quality teachers.

184
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.880
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

185
00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.760
<v 1>And then there were his economic measures. For example,</v>

186
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:44.450
the port of Dar ES Salaam was a gateway to East Africa goods floated through

187
00:10:44.451 --> 00:10:47.570
there, to, and from neighboring countries and the interior of the continent,

188
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.430
such as Malawi or Zambia. Well,

189
00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.910
Margaret fooly wanted to take economic advantage of this situation by increasing

190
00:10:52.911 --> 00:10:55.100
the tax burden on all of this trait.

191
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.840
What do you think he achieved in doing so though,

192
00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.890
the shipping companies simply changed their trade routes and now use Kenyan

193
00:11:00.891 --> 00:11:04.370
ports more frequently. Unfortunately, this was not the worst measure.

194
00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:07.940
Other economic sectors have not had the opportunity to escape so easily from the

195
00:11:07.941 --> 00:11:08.774
sudden changes.

196
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.180
During the last few years,

197
00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:17.660
any rule of law that provides certain guarantees to investors has completely

198
00:11:17.661 --> 00:11:21.080
disappeared in this country. Let's just say that the abuses of the MegaFood,

199
00:11:21.081 --> 00:11:24.680
the government against foreign companies have been relentless up to the point of

200
00:11:24.681 --> 00:11:26.540
greeting situations like this.

201
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:31.790
<v 0>Tanzania has hit a British mining company with a fine worth two centuries of</v>

202
00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:32.624
revenue.

203
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.590
<v 1>We all know that the exploitation of Africa's natural resources is always a</v>

204
00:11:36.591 --> 00:11:37.520
sensitive issue.

205
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:41.810
It's delicate because the benefit of all that wealth is hardly ever noticed

206
00:11:41.811 --> 00:11:42.290
locally.

207
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:45.800
But this time we are talking about a fame to the British company of Acadia,

208
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.380
meaning of no less than hold onto your hats.

209
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.600
$190 billion. That is roughly four, the current GDP of Tanzania. And of course,

210
00:11:55.601 --> 00:11:56.650
some of you may be wondering,

211
00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.060
so how on earth did the microfilm government justify cruising on all of those

212
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.460
zeros? Well, according to their calculations,

213
00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:07.990
$40 billion was in arrears and the other 150 billion was an interest.

214
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:12.220
And the tax penalty itself Acadia was accused of declaring less than 10% of its

215
00:12:12.221 --> 00:12:14.350
gold exports from Tanzania. Of course,

216
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.170
it must be said that the company's response was fantastic.

217
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.670
They told microphilia, let's see,

218
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.740
we would love your accusation to be real since,

219
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.890
and that case we would be exploiting the largest gold mines in the world,

220
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.800
but it is simply not SU. So in the end,

221
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.970
Acadia and Tanzania have agreed to settle this matter for $300 million.

222
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.360
Meanwhile, of course, international investors have already taken notes.

223
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.273
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

224
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.190
<v 1>Take, for example, the case of the British company, Petra diamonds,</v>

225
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.080
but it's put as diamond mine in Tanzania,

226
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:46.170
up for sale due to similar accusations of tax evasion,

227
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:49.890
the new obstacles to foreign investment have even affected interest in projects,

228
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.600
such as the port of Baga Memorial,

229
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.990
a mega project in which the Chinese companies involved and the Omani sovereign

230
00:12:54.991 --> 00:12:58.200
wealth funds have just not been able to reach an agreement with the Tanzania.

231
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:02.430
<v 0>Wow.</v>

232
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.580
<v 1>They must have plenty of capital to put up so many obstacles to foreigners,</v>

233
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:09.600
right? Basically this is a good example of how dangerous populism can be.

234
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:12.930
The fact is that the slowdown in investment flows should have had a significant

235
00:13:12.931 --> 00:13:15.060
impact on the Tanzanian economy. However,

236
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.600
the official figures provided by the mega foolish government keep GDP growth

237
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.270
above 5% per year. Of course,

238
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:25.350
those numbers do not convince international organizations such as the world bank

239
00:13:25.351 --> 00:13:29.370
and the IMF that things have not been going well in this country for a long

240
00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.840
time. There is simply no explanation as to how the economy can be growing or tax

241
00:13:33.841 --> 00:13:37.380
revenues and loans to the private sector are falling less technical,

242
00:13:37.381 --> 00:13:40.920
but still very significant figures have also taken a fall such as the sales of

243
00:13:40.921 --> 00:13:44.730
the country's largest brewery. I mean, come on, right? This reeks of it.

244
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:45.743
<v 0>Racist.</v>

245
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:53.280
<v 1>And then there is the apparently non-existent effects of COVID-19 on the</v>

246
00:13:53.281 --> 00:13:54.210
country's economy.

247
00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:58.290
Microphilia declared months ago that Tanzania was free of Corona virus.

248
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.990
Of course, news. Like this makes us suspect that this is not.

249
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:08.010
<v 0>It is no longer a crime to publish statistics in Tanzania, the citizen, Oh.</v>

250
00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.490
<v 1>The international pressure exerted by the world bank has made the mega freely</v>

251
00:14:11.491 --> 00:14:14.880
government reversely approved legislation that made it a crane to publish

252
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:17.940
unofficial testings. But hold on just one moment,

253
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:19.890
because even though it is now decriminalized,

254
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.100
the approval of the national statistics office is still needed in order to

255
00:14:23.101 --> 00:14:26.430
publish any unofficial data. So as you can imagine,

256
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:30.810
freedom of expression is not a strong point in Tanzania, far from it.

257
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.720
And all this repression has also reached the political opposition.

258
00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.350
And what way though? Well, let's take a look at that right now.

259
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:47.100
<v 0>The future of Tanzania, Tanzania.</v>

260
00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.053
<v 1>Economic growth.</v>

261
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:51.710
This is abandoned African socialism and opened up to the free market has had one

262
00:14:51.711 --> 00:14:54.530
key element. So far political stability.

263
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.980
They've never faced a civil war or a military dictatorship.

264
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:02.000
The country opened up to multi-party politics 25 years ago, since then, however,

265
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.570
the ruling party has been the same as before the multi-party system, Chama chap,

266
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.080
Maputo, Kinsey. And I really hope that's how you see it in Swahili.

267
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:12.170
Just bear in mind, mispronouncing things is my thing. I'm Scottish.

268
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.850
I barely speak English translated.

269
00:15:13.851 --> 00:15:16.820
It means something along the lanes of the party of the revolution.

270
00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.590
And don't ask me what revolution,

271
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.650
because it's the typical party that doesn't want to change anything.

272
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.800
And the most revolutionary thing about it as its name. So at this point,

273
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.680
some of you are probably thinking, all right, let's hold on a minute. It's not,

274
00:15:27.681 --> 00:15:30.500
the Tanzania was very democratic before mega freely,

275
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:34.940
but the same party has always governed. Right? And yes, yes. Okay.

276
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.600
You're right.

277
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.110
But we are talking about a country with a defective democracy that has turned

278
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:40.240
into.

279
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.920
<v 2>This Tanzania arrests, opposition party leader, revokes newspaper license,</v>

280
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:45.783
Reuters.

281
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.800
<v 1>Stories like this one from June,</v>

282
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.340
2020 have become commonplace and Tanzania newspaper closures, censorship,

283
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.260
artist, band, and even arrested.

284
00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.920
Anyone who moves against mega Philly puts themselves in the bill.

285
00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.340
Those are sites. It's the same story in the political arena. For example,

286
00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:06.250
live television coverage of parliamentary debates has been banned.

287
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.640
So that criticism of microfilm is not visible rallies and political

288
00:16:09.641 --> 00:16:14.260
demonstrations have also been banned disappearances of journalists critical or

289
00:16:14.261 --> 00:16:17.080
just even opposed to the government or the order of the day.

290
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.170
And the violence has reached unusual levels.

291
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:22.660
You only have to look at the case of the opposition candidate for the

292
00:16:22.661 --> 00:16:26.320
presidential elections held on October 28th parliamentarian to-do.

293
00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.960
Lisa has spent three years between Kenya and Belgium,

294
00:16:28.961 --> 00:16:31.360
recovering from the serious consequences of the shooting.

295
00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:33.730
He was a victim of a shooting, which by the way,

296
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:35.650
no one has ever been arrested for.

297
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.430
Although I think by now we can all guess who was behind it.

298
00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:43.450
And that is precisely why he didn't return to Tanzania until last July.

299
00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:48.340
His safety is not guaranteed and that is the main opposition

300
00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.233
candidate.

301
00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.320
And then there's another outcome. All this oppression has scared away.

302
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:59.860
International donors reluctant to finance the whims of a president who puts on

303
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:00.850
airs and graces.

304
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:06.070
<v 2>Tanzania now forced to fund its budget as donor aid freeze bites.</v>

305
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.530
<v 1>Faced with this scenario, it's,</v>

306
00:17:07.531 --> 00:17:10.960
it's difficult to imagine an adverse electoral result for mega fooly five years

307
00:17:10.961 --> 00:17:14.800
ago, he won with 58% of the votes against 40% for the opposition party.

308
00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.800
This is the tightest result and Tanzania's short history.

309
00:17:17.830 --> 00:17:19.120
And so it comes down to this,

310
00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.180
the fact that it seems impossible for the opposition to have any chance of

311
00:17:22.181 --> 00:17:24.370
winning the election is a real shame.

312
00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:27.790
And there are two reasons for this because political alternation is good for

313
00:17:27.791 --> 00:17:29.140
consolidating a democracy,

314
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:33.130
especially when [inaudible] has been in power for as long as Tanzania has

315
00:17:33.131 --> 00:17:35.830
existed. And secondly, because there is a viable alternative,

316
00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:38.650
the opposition led by [inaudible] has not become radical,

317
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.290
has not become a party desperate for the domination of JAMA jam.

318
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.990
Quinsy are eager for revenge on the contrary. In fact,

319
00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:47.230
they appear to want to follow the example of Abby Amad and Ethiopia.

320
00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.820
Kadimah aims to fight corruption,

321
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:52.320
defending moderate center rate approaches and a more liberal economic model.

322
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.650
Something that let's face. It would be very attractive to investors.

323
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:58.170
And secondly, given what I have seen and the way things are,

324
00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:01.500
could be quite good for the country on one moment,

325
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:03.870
because if the opposition is having a hard time in Tanzania,

326
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.060
there are even worse off in Zanzibar.

327
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:12.770
You see Zanzibar has been in a deep crisis since the result of the regional

328
00:18:12.771 --> 00:18:16.910
elections was a Nolde five years ago. When everything pointed to the opposition,

329
00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.720
winning the violent regression suffered by the opposition supporters carried out

330
00:18:20.721 --> 00:18:24.800
by pro government malicious Nunez. The zombies is radicalizing the situation,

331
00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.120
the civic United front,

332
00:18:26.121 --> 00:18:29.810
a moderate party once aspiring to cool governed Tanzania with the dominant force

333
00:18:29.811 --> 00:18:30.530
in tanking,

334
00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:34.040
Nika is being pushed to defend the right for self-determination of the Zanzibar.

335
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.010
I'll have to wait and see what happens with the election results,

336
00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.710
but the discontent of the local population is increasing.

337
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:46.310
And don't forget that we are talking about a mostly young Muslim population with

338
00:18:46.311 --> 00:18:48.550
growing unemployment due to the decline in tourism,

339
00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.250
in the face of the pandemic and a population who are already oppressed by the

340
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:54.620
Tanzanian authorities and short here,

341
00:18:54.621 --> 00:18:58.760
we have all of the elements necessary for Islamist extremism to prosper.

342
00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.640
And the truth is my friends. We said at the start, we like to be optimistic.

343
00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:04.280
We don't like having to bring up all these things about Tanzania,

344
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:07.880
which is surely a wonderful country with the Serengeti and Mount Kilimanjaro.

345
00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.360
So microphilia would do well to tune down his authoritarianism before turning a

346
00:19:11.361 --> 00:19:14.120
country that had been taking the right steps towards the future and to an

347
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:17.960
isolated, pure Tanzania that is more like his personal country estate.

348
00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.200
But now it's your turn and today's questions are key.

349
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.560
Did you think there should be stronger international pressure on such presidents

350
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.050
or do you think it is better not to meddle in another countries,

351
00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.630
internal affairs and most importantly,

352
00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.320
will there ever be an episode where I pronounce all of the names correctly?

353
00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.170
Leave your answer in the comments. Have you find this video interesting.
