1
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.320
<v 1>Let me ask you a question. And as you know, new, as always,</v>

2
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.830
it's not worth searching for the answer on Google Wikipedia or anywhere else,

3
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.070
where would you say that the largest number of artworks in the world are

4
00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:19.940
concentrated?

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.420
I'm sure most of you will think of the Louvre in Paris or the MoMA in New York,

6
00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:25.220
or maybe even the British museum in London,

7
00:00:25.221 --> 00:00:27.350
because we used to steal a lot of stuff.

8
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:31.603
<v 0>Well, I'm sorry.</v>

9
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.840
<v 1>But no. Okay. Yes.</v>

10
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.720
It's true that all of those museums house gigantic collections,

11
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:39.560
and then we'd also have to define exactly what we consider art and not,

12
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.290
but my visual public geeks, regardless of all these issues,

13
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.590
there is a veritable art truth that you've likely, never thought about.

14
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.130
The answer to the question we are asking ourselves at the beginning involves

15
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.340
careful consideration of Geneva in Switzerland. There,

16
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.410
we will find a very special place,

17
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.920
a place that houses one of the largest collections and certainly the greatest

18
00:00:57.921 --> 00:01:00.860
amount of fine arts per square meter in the world.

19
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.880
And you know what the most surprising thing of all this is that neither you nor

20
00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:07.070
I will ever be able to enjoy it.

21
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.730
Talking about the Freeport of Geneva. No, really, really,

22
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.550
we're not making a mistake. We are talking about to port and Geneva,

23
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.450
which despite having no see is one of the most important free ports in the

24
00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:22.490
world. For those who aren't really familiar with them,

25
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.420
three ports are places with Alexa regulations and much less tax.

26
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.900
The idea is to make it easier to move goods founded in 1888.

27
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.350
The Geneva Freeport is located next to a large railway station where the dry

28
00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:37.070
port for goods and far from what we might think it is neither an area restricted

29
00:01:37.071 --> 00:01:41.330
to passage nor is it's a highly protected site surrounded by huge fences walls

30
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.680
and lots of security guards.

31
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.040
The truth is that the largest art collections in the world are in a couple of

32
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.720
not very large buildings that's located in your setting would probably go,

33
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.360
Nope, because this warehouse has so many works of art,

34
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.250
but not even the leaders of the Geneva.

35
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.700
Freeport are able to quantify numbers to give you an idea.

36
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.330
It is estimated that within its walls are stored thousands, tens of thousands,

37
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.990
possibly hundreds of thousands of works of art by such outstanding artists as

38
00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:13.580
Leonardo da Vinci, fungal Renoir, El Greco among countless others. For example,

39
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.510
as believes that there are more than 1000 of Picasso's works deposited here.

40
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.910
<v 0>In.</v>

41
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.760
<v 1>Fact, after an audit by swish officials in 2012,</v>

42
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.770
it was revealed that there could be. And just remember,

43
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.920
this is just an estimate about 1 million,

44
00:02:27.921 --> 00:02:30.110
200,000 works of art,

45
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.620
which would put it in the top three of world collections. And remember,

46
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.790
we're talking about a 2012 audit as believed at the current inventory could be

47
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.120
even greater to help you understand the magnitude we're talking about.

48
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.710
The national gallery in London has about 2,300 paintings and its

49
00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:49.760
collection. And the moment in New York, almost 200,000 works of art of various.

50
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.950
<v 0>So.</v>

51
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.690
<v 1>We're not only talking about the largest deposits of archived art on the whole</v>

52
00:02:56.691 --> 00:02:59.150
planet, but if we also take into account the quality,

53
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.600
the value of the work stored there, then with them,

54
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.250
you could possibly create the most impressive art gallery in the entire world.

55
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.310
So you probably want to know more about this secretive and stunning place.

56
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.700
What do you think about immersing yourself in a market as covert as the

57
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.650
international art market? Well,

58
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.380
you're in luck because that is exactly what we're going to talk about in this

59
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:18.610
video. Or let's get started.

60
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.750
<v 2>The free port of Geneva shelter or hiding place.</v>

61
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.453
<v 1>Well, let's be honest.</v>

62
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.730
The actual goods and figures handled engineer's report are unknown.

63
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.850
Even their own directors are not able to give concrete figures.

64
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.390
Do you know about this mysterious place? Is that amongst paintings, sculptures,

65
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.210
all types of antiques and pieces of art, of every variety,

66
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.260
the value of the works deposited here is simply unpleasantly priceless.

67
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.460
What's more, this space has become a good business for the Canton of Geneva.

68
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.080
I can't on that in addition to owning almost 90% of the shares of this Freeport

69
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.910
has income each year from this activity totaling more than $10 million,

70
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.900
but why degree collectors and great fortunes keep their collections and this

71
00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:10.290
place and not any other, what advantages does it offer and why.

72
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.670
<v 0>Is it called a port? I'm sure.</v>

73
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.361
<v 1>Exactly.</v>

74
00:04:15.361 --> 00:04:18.510
What many of you are asking yourself at this point and no wonder the traffic and

75
00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:22.200
works of art is one of the most Etymotic business activities out there before we

76
00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:23.250
go on a quick note,

77
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.510
don't think for a moment that Geneva is the only tax-free art bunker we can find

78
00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:28.170
in the world.

79
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.440
Another of the most significant ones is close to Singapore airport.

80
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.800
I'm one of the most recent to open is in Delaware and the United States.

81
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.230
In other words, this concept is not unique.

82
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.330
Although Geneva is definitely the biggest,

83
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.280
Even though the Freeport of Geneva is only one of the 10 free ports and 245 free

84
00:04:47.281 --> 00:04:51.120
zones that exist in Switzerland as an art bunker has become the greatest tax

85
00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:53.670
Haven for large investors in this market.

86
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.240
One of the main advantages it offers is the possibility to make transactions

87
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.410
that is buy and sell works in the Freeport itself without paying any tax.

88
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.180
As long as goods do not leave the Freeport,

89
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.220
everything done is tax exempt is also tax-free to store an import art in

90
00:05:08.221 --> 00:05:10.710
this place. And that's important because my friends,

91
00:05:10.711 --> 00:05:12.630
the truth is that in most countries, Paris,

92
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.980
our taxes are between five and 15% are charged for the amputation of works.

93
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.820
<v 0>Oh, of course.</v>

94
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:21.661
<v 1>Tax advantages.</v>

95
00:05:21.661 --> 00:05:24.420
Aren't the only thing that leads the world's biggest art collectors to use

96
00:05:24.421 --> 00:05:24.930
Geneva.

97
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.530
Let's say there is something else fundamental that also has a lot to do with

98
00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:31.770
Swiss financial culture. And that is discretion.

99
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.330
<v 2>The Geneva free port is quite old. It is not an especially a glamorous place,</v>

100
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.850
but this is not important. When you go to see a work of art,

101
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.720
it only means decent illumination and the certainty that it is well guarded,

102
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.380
the place is practical and central is a safe place to work and people value

103
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:50.850
discretion. Joel, Renee, Salyards sales director of fine art fund group.

104
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.010
<v 1>Let's just say that they follow the old Swiss premise. Don't ask. Of course,</v>

105
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.000
as you can imagine, that's not a policy that comes without

106
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.450
1994. For example,

107
00:06:04.451 --> 00:06:08.050
antiquities looted from the Getty museum in Los Angeles were discovered in the

108
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.640
free port of Geneva in 1993, 200 ancient pieces stolen from Egypt were found.

109
00:06:12.641 --> 00:06:15.550
And more recently our Romans, our caucus was found in 2010,

110
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.150
the disappearance of which had been reported in Turkey and in 2016,

111
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.970
two Etruscan sarcophaguses were returned to Italy.

112
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.680
These at other previous scandals,

113
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.580
forced reforms to bring in regulations to imports that target this Freeport and

114
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.940
Lang with those or similar zones within the rest of Switzerland. And this way,

115
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:34.570
and porters of works of art arriving in Geneva must know declare the name of the

116
00:06:34.571 --> 00:06:38.920
owner, the origin and the value of the goods they store. And since 2009,

117
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.640
the Freeport of Geneva must also have an inventory of all of the items to be

118
00:06:42.641 --> 00:06:44.710
found there. So what's the problem. Well,

119
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.510
many pieces not to mention most of the pieces that were stored there before 2009

120
00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.810
have not been able to be inventors so only their owners knew that they are

121
00:06:52.811 --> 00:06:54.700
there. And what the real value is.

122
00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:58.570
In addition,

123
00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.170
these kinds of places are not spared accusations about the role they play in the

124
00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:04.420
global money laundering market.

125
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.273
<v 0>Surprise.</v>

126
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.630
<v 1>According to many experts,</v>

127
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.350
it is relatively easy to arrive with a good bundle of illicitly obtained bills

128
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.310
by a painting with them and resell it months later to get clean money without

129
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:20.860
even having to take the box out of the warehouse.

130
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.850
And as long as you don't sell it, believe me, your money is safe.

131
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.600
Of course not all art lovers are money laundering and my visual polar geeks,

132
00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:29.710
apart from these issues,

133
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.310
the question we can ask ourselves as is this a shelter or a hiding place?

134
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.250
I'll leave you a video in the description related to this SU I think you might

135
00:07:36.251 --> 00:07:40.960
find interest At this point.

136
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.650
How about we review what the international art market is, Lake on, what it is?

137
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.410
Why does so many great fortunes invested their money in art?

138
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.480
How much money does this market move annually?

139
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.360
What are the leading and emerging countries in the world? Arts trades.

140
00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.600
If you want to know the answers to these questions, you had better stay tuned.

141
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.770
<v 0>The art market safe value.</v>

142
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.900
<v 1>When we think of a value refuge to invest our money in,</v>

143
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.430
what do we always think about real estate investments, stocks gold, maybe. Well,

144
00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.580
for the really big fortunes art also plays a key role.

145
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.930
It's surprising as it might be.

146
00:08:16.931 --> 00:08:20.800
The truth is that art trading has managed to overcome the hardest effects of the

147
00:08:20.801 --> 00:08:22.540
great recession and position itself.

148
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:26.890
As one of the safest nonfinancial assets used by large fortunes to invest their

149
00:08:26.891 --> 00:08:30.820
money. In fact,

150
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.320
as you can see in this graph,

151
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.560
the flow of money that has moved in the art market has remained quite stable.

152
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:36.670
Over the last decade,

153
00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.230
we are talking about a market that moves more than $60 billion every year in art

154
00:08:41.231 --> 00:08:42.250
sales, by the way,

155
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.460
can you imagine which countries are the main players and activity for this

156
00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:49.450
market? Well, this time it's not Switzerland, it's basically two countries,

157
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.360
the United States and the United Kingdom together,

158
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:56.040
they account for more than 70% of experts.

159
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.800
Yes. Yeah. I know what you guys are thinking.

160
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.850
Haven't come this far and you're thinking to yourself, all right, grant,

161
00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.080
but what does all this mean?

162
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:07.100
Why is art apparently so highly prized by great fortunes and seriously,

163
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:08.143
why is it.

164
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.983
<v 0>Cold a port?</v>

165
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:14.960
<v 1>Well, just think about it for one moment. Every year that passes money,</v>

166
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.920
loses value.

167
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.890
Businesses can be exposed to all kinds of technological and commercial

168
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.890
revolution. And if you don't believe me, just think about companies like,

169
00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:25.160
I don't know, Kodak, Blackberry blockbuster. Remember those guys.

170
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.350
If you make loans, you may have to face delinquency.

171
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.860
And if you invest your money in fixed income and then a financial crisis occurs,

172
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.860
you may have many possibilities to lose much of your fortune,

173
00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.980
but do you really think that one day the value of a Amani,

174
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.080
a Vanguard or a castle will depreciate,

175
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:42.320
do you think that signature art that is of renowned artists could lose.

176
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:46.220
<v 0>The truth?</v>

177
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.090
<v 1>It says that to date,</v>

178
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.780
there have been very few cases in which a famous work of art has been sold at a

179
00:09:50.781 --> 00:09:52.880
lower price than it was previously purchased.

180
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.780
And that's exactly what encourages a large fortune to create their own art

181
00:09:56.781 --> 00:09:57.230
collection.

182
00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:01.580
And that's also what explains why real fortunes have been paid for some pieces,

183
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.200
for example, in 2017,

184
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:06.650
Leonardo da Vinci's Salvatore Mundi was sold in New York for a whopping

185
00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.630
$450 million. No, really $450 million.

186
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:14.660
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

187
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:15.470
<v 1>Let's take note here.</v>

188
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:18.290
Two important things that we have to take into account when talking about art,

189
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.440
the art market is very closed because if you don't want to screw up,

190
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:25.310
you really have to know your stuff. And of course, as in any other market,

191
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.730
bubbles can be produced. And profitability is far from assured,

192
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.760
especially when you pay a lot for works of questionable.

193
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.920
In any case. The truth is that for decades,

194
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.850
the art market has been advancing favorably, monetary expansions, market,

195
00:10:40.851 --> 00:10:44.000
interest rates, currency, devaluation, et cetera. For example,

196
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.700
take a look at this chart that shows us how the price of the most expensive

197
00:10:46.701 --> 00:10:51.050
contemporary artwork sold since 1989 has evolved in 1989.

198
00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:55.190
The most expensive piece of contemporary art was sold for just over $20 million.

199
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:59.150
And now the most expensive piece of art that was sold last year in 2019,

200
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:04.100
a sculpture of a steel rabbit was sold for a whopping $91 million.

201
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:04.963
That's 14.

202
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:07.880
<v 0>Okay.</v>

203
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.650
<v 1>You said that let's take this a step further.</v>

204
00:11:09.651 --> 00:11:13.760
Can you imagine in which country this market has grown the most in recent years?

205
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:14.810
Well, I want you,

206
00:11:14.811 --> 00:11:17.270
you're not gonna believe this and you really will not believe this because the

207
00:11:17.271 --> 00:11:22.130
country I'm talking about is Argentina. No, really, really Argentina

208
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.840
by volume of exports of paintings and drawings.

209
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.240
Argentina ranks seventh in the world.

210
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:34.250
The land of the tango moved $483.5 million with this commercial

211
00:11:34.251 --> 00:11:35.600
activity in 2019.

212
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:40.520
That's now pay attention to this number 1203% more

213
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.970
than the previous year. But if you really want to shock,

214
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.920
let's compare that to 2015.

215
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.100
The growth since then has been hold onto your butts.

216
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.380
56848 cent.

217
00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.670
You might logically be asking yourself why is going on in Argentina?

218
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:01.980
Why is the art market there? Skyrocketing?

219
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:02.963
<v 0>Let's take a look,</v>

220
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.350
a surprising case of Argentina.

221
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.540
<v 1>You said many times here before on visual politics,</v>

222
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.990
Argentina is for it's bureaucracy, it's regulations, it's taxes and tires,

223
00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:22.260
and a long et cetera of restrictions and impediments on an economic nature,

224
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:25.020
IE hellhole for a business and trade activity. However,

225
00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:29.190
the case of arts seems like an exception and this area Argentine law is very

226
00:12:29.191 --> 00:12:32.130
similar. And even freer than that, of many developed countries

227
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.070
After the amendment of law, two, four, six, three,

228
00:12:38.071 --> 00:12:41.910
three on the international circulation of works of art in January, 2018,

229
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:42.511
Argentina,

230
00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:45.930
further relaxed to procedures for exporting and importing works of arts.

231
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:50.460
Now only one export notice is needed for the work of artists alive or deceased

232
00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:51.630
up to 50 years ago.

233
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:55.980
That is our exports are not subject to licensing or virtually any state control

234
00:12:55.981 --> 00:12:59.850
in a country where everything absolutely everything is regulated in some way.

235
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.270
If we tell you that this procedure can be done completely online,

236
00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.100
it gets even more interesting.

237
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:09.413
<v 0>Right?</v>

238
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:16.200
<v 1>Not only that for works of art by artists who died more than 50 years ago,</v>

239
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.510
you only need a license from the ministry of culture,

240
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.360
which can be obtained in less than 48 hours.

241
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.520
I wish everything was so easy in Argentina.

242
00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:27.180
I wish anything was so easy anywhere that would certainly change a lot of things

243
00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:29.280
and make life there a little bit easier.

244
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.590
The fact that is the Argentine that allows you, for example,

245
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.360
to arrive as a tourist by art,

246
00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:36.960
and then take it out of the country as hand luggage on your plane without any

247
00:13:36.961 --> 00:13:37.980
problem. In addition,

248
00:13:37.981 --> 00:13:41.220
the law allows you to move art from abroad and enter the country without any

249
00:13:41.221 --> 00:13:43.440
limitation in the case of fairs or exhibitions,

250
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.210
and whether they need to perform slow,

251
00:13:45.211 --> 00:13:49.320
bureaucratic procedures that costs time and most importantly money. In fact,

252
00:13:49.321 --> 00:13:51.210
when we're talking about art and many ways,

253
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:54.240
Argentina simply does not seem like Argentina

254
00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.810
In this particular market would be so liberalized and deregulated. Well,

255
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.170
the official argument is that it is intended to promote to the circulation of

256
00:14:04.171 --> 00:14:05.910
Argentine art around the world,

257
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.790
close quotes and thereby strengthened the national art.

258
00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:18.253
<v 3>[Inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

259
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.540
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible].

260
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:31.380
<v 1>As if the same premise would not justify doing exactly the same with the rest of</v>

261
00:14:31.381 --> 00:14:32.520
the sectors in the economy.

262
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:36.150
So why on earth is arts more important than I don't know, the gem industry,

263
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.410
for example, and this,

264
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.590
my visual politics nerds is precisely what doesn't feel right.

265
00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:44.010
Could Argentina becoming more than a regional epicenter for the art market and

266
00:14:44.011 --> 00:14:46.380
turning into something a little murkier.

267
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.380
It's just really not something that we can confirm 100% today,

268
00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:51.000
but the suspicions are on the table,

269
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.200
especially considering how the rest of the Argentine economy works.

270
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.900
But we've brought you this far. It is your turn to note.

271
00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:59.870
What is your opinion of the art market? Would you invest your money and it's,

272
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.760
and for the love of all that is Holy,

273
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.700
why is it called a port and a landlocked country?

274
