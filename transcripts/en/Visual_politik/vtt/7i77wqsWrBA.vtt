<v 1>Chicken is famous for its great lakes being homesick Kellogg's and the big three</v>

00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:16.760
automobile makers, general motors, Ford, and Chrysler. It's also the 10th,

4
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.530
most populated States in the United States. It's home to almost 10 million.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.130
<v 0>In terms of.</v>

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.940
<v 1>Surface area. It's the 11th largest. But trust me, in this case,</v>

7
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.970
size doesn't matter. 40% of Michigan is underwater.

8
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.670
Let's see if you've thought that the great lakes were an exaggeration.

9
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.080
They do indeed have enough water to submerge the whole of the Czech Republic and

10
00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:40.070
part of Slovakia.

11
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.740
But today we're not going to talk about Michigan's natural wonders.

12
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.350
Today is about the upcoming election. Tuesday,

13
00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:47.120
3rd of November is fast approaching.

14
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.390
And the truth is that the presidential election has suddenly become very

15
00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:54.050
interesting a year ago. Trump's reelection seemed inevitable,

16
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.110
but 2020 and the Corona virus has changed everything.

17
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.370
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

18
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.040
<v 1>Talking about a state with a lot of industry, a lot of factories.</v>

19
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.130
And that means that there are a lot of voters who belong to the working group.

20
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.023
<v 0>Wow.</v>

21
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.290
<v 1>Principal,</v>

22
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.960
you might think that these voters would be more likely to vote for the

23
00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:22.430
Democrats, right? Well, the truth is that they are not in 2016.

24
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.150
Donald Trump got into the pockets of these voters with his anti-China speech.

25
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.250
He did the same thing with many of Bernie Sanders,

26
00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:30.320
his supporters in the democratic primary,

27
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.290
we are talking about those attracted to the left of the party.

28
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.400
Those closest to the labor movement workers who felt betrayed by those giving

29
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:41.510
orders in Washington workers who feel that the democratic party cares more about

30
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.760
defending minorities in the working class.

31
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.140
And Trump took advantage of that more specifically is then campaign manager,

32
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.850
the one and only Steve Bannon.

33
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.450
<v 0>Steve Bannon we've turned the Republicans into a working class party.</v>

34
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.313
The guardian.

35
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.100
<v 1>Michigan voted for Trump against the Watts after supporting democratic</v>

36
00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:05.540
candidates in the six previous elections in 2016, they bet on the Republican,

37
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.470
uh, change that was ultimately decisive in getting Trump into the white house.

38
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.340
Now Trump is up for reelection and we'll be going to the polls at the worst

39
00:02:13.341 --> 00:02:14.150
possible time.

40
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.480
The country faces a complicated economic landscape as the fight against the

41
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.580
Corona virus continues. And yes,

42
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.540
the pandemic is global and economic difficulties affect multiple countries right

43
00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:23.840
now.

44
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.310
But at this time the American voter is concerned about his or her own country.

45
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.800
So the question is why is Michigan so important?

46
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.460
Will it be Michigan that decides in November who occupies the white house for

47
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:36.830
the next four years today on visual politic,

48
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.100
we're going to answer these questions, but first let's take a look at some here.

49
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.200
<v 0>The electoral college.</v>

50
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.040
<v 1>Do you think that the United States is a first past the post democracy and it</v>

51
00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:52.340
all comes down to who gets the most votes? Well, yeah, very much mistaken.

52
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.120
Four years ago,

53
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.740
we saw why there are now five times in us history when the candidate who

54
00:02:57.741 --> 00:02:59.090
received the most popular,

55
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.760
it not become the president elect five times in which the Republican party

56
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:04.840
candidate benefited.

57
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.670
The last two were very recent 20 years ago when Bush won by a tiny margin

58
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.610
over Al Gore. And in 2016, when Trump beat Hillary.

59
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:13.703
<v 2>Clinton.</v>

60
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.060
<v 1>Don't forget that Hillary Clinton had almost 3 million more votes than Trump.</v>

61
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.680
Two percentage points. However, Trump had the upper hand at the moment of truth.

62
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.600
He had 304 electoral college folks compared to Hillary Clinton's 227

63
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.600
Ask, why does this happen?

64
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.400
Why does the United States have such a seemingly undemocratic system? Well,

65
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.350
as strangers, that seems it does actually make sense. You see,

66
00:03:43.351 --> 00:03:47.280
the United States is a federal state composed of 50 States each with its own

67
00:03:47.281 --> 00:03:50.160
idiosyncrasies. Imagine if a candidate emerged,

68
00:03:50.161 --> 00:03:54.300
who was hated throughout the country, but very popular in California or Texas,

69
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.070
which are the most populous States,

70
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.790
No,

71
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.680
this candidate was able to get almost unanimous support from all Californians,

72
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.520
both in terms of percentage of votes and percentage of voter participation,

73
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.290
suddenly Californians or Texans could impose their preferences on the rest of

74
00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:14.640
the States in the union.

75
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.120
That is why the United States has an electoral system designed to fulfill a

76
00:04:18.121 --> 00:04:18.600
mission,

77
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.020
to prevent the victory of a candidate supported by only one region of the

78
00:04:22.021 --> 00:04:24.630
country. Even if that support is very, very good.

79
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.913
<v 2>Stroke.</v>

80
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.670
<v 1>Almost all democracies have similar safeguards in almost all countries.</v>

81
00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:35.490
The prime minister is not elected by direct vote.

82
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.750
Citizens vote for a parliament and this parliament votes for the prime minister.

83
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.660
And that's why you have to look at the election state by state,

84
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.800
both in the United States and in almost any other country in the United States,

85
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.910
voters elect all 538 members of the electoral college.

86
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.510
The only mission of this electoral college is to elect the president and vice

87
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.110
president.

88
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.950
The us constitution says that federal elections are to be held on the Tuesday

89
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.990
after the first Monday in November.

90
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.040
And that each state's electoral college must can't sit folks on the first Monday

91
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.030
following the second Wednesday in December of the same.

92
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.203
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

93
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.290
<v 1>138 Voters do not even meet together. No.</v>

94
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.210
On the appointed day of December,

95
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.670
they go to the capitals of their respective States.

96
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.590
And from there they cast their votes. And you're probably wondering why 538,

97
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.610
which is a lot if in the end they act as mere delegates. Well,

98
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.320
because 538 is the sum of the 435 members of the house of

99
00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:35.190
representatives,

100
00:05:35.191 --> 00:05:38.010
which are distributed according to the population of each state.

101
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.580
Plus the 100 members of the Senate, which are two per state,

102
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.050
regardless of his population.

103
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.280
And another three who represent the district of Columbia that is Washington,

104
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.390
the federal capital.

105
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.960
So you could say that the distribution of electoral college members is more or

106
00:05:51.961 --> 00:05:54.090
less according to the population of each state.

107
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.000
So California has 55 votes in the electoral college.

108
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.360
Texas has 38 and Michigan has 16.

109
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.110
Wait a moment because here comes the really complicated part. In most States,

110
00:06:08.111 --> 00:06:10.960
the winning candidate takes all the votes. For example,

111
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.240
suppose Biden wins the election in California,

112
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.440
which is quite likely well when those 55 electoral college representatives meet

113
00:06:17.441 --> 00:06:19.750
in December, they will all vote for Biden.

114
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.500
So it doesn't matter if a candidate wins the Michigan election by one vote or a

115
00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:26.050
million votes. The important thing is to win.

116
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.410
Then the candidate would get 16 votes from the electoral college and would it be

117
00:06:29.411 --> 00:06:33.940
closer to the two 70 votes needed to become president only in Nebraska and Maine

118
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.430
and our electors to split votes between the candidates,

119
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.230
according to the votes received in each of them.

120
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.213
<v 2>Strips.</v>

121
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.040
<v 1>That's why Michigan is so important because even though 16 votes may not seem</v>

122
00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:48.790
like a lot,

123
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.690
keep in mind that it is one of those swing States that put some more votes into

124
00:06:52.691 --> 00:06:55.210
play and don't lose sight of another obvious fact.

125
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.210
But one that is truly interesting in a two party system,

126
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.500
which is that we are talking about the 16 voters that one candidate wins and the

127
00:07:02.501 --> 00:07:06.040
16 voters that the other candidate fails to win. Four years ago,

128
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.910
77 electoral college votes separated Trump and Clinton and keeping these

129
00:07:09.911 --> 00:07:14.110
calculations in mind, Michigan represents 32 of that 77 difference,

130
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.700
which doesn't seem so few anymore.

131
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.570
The question now is how do Michigan voters feel about this upcoming election?

132
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.880
What do they think about it? Well, let's take a look.

133
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:27.430
<v 2>[Inaudible] American.</v>

134
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.260
<v 3>Capitalism as a broken toy.</v>

135
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.980
<v 1>Michigan has no major cities other than Detroit yet.</v>

136
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.340
Most of its population is concentrated in urban areas.

137
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.840
Only 18% live in rural areas and industry plays a major role in Michigan's

138
00:07:40.841 --> 00:07:43.660
economy. It contributes 30% of the state's GDP.

139
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.830
The financial crisis of 2009 was a critical time for the entire

140
00:07:47.831 --> 00:07:50.590
United States. In previous visual politic videos,

141
00:07:50.591 --> 00:07:54.010
we have talked about the problems Detroit has gone through and how the city has

142
00:07:54.011 --> 00:07:56.320
managed to reinvent itself and generate jobs again.

143
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.060
<v 3>From rust belt to high tech,</v>

144
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.850
how employment rebounded in Michigan industry today.

145
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:04.991
<v 1>Yet, as you can imagine,</v>

146
00:08:04.991 --> 00:08:08.260
almost everything still revolves around the automotive industry today.

147
00:08:08.261 --> 00:08:11.680
The state of Michigan produces more than 2 million cars each year,

148
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.900
about the same as the whole of France.

149
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.170
So there are a lot of workers who depend on the auto industry,

150
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.650
people who wanted to back Sanders and instead encountered Hillary Clinton.

151
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.800
So fed up with an economic system that for decades has favored,

152
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.070
outsourcing to other countries. They voted for Trump and the president,

153
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.210
When did that, Detroit's reached its peak in the 1950s.

154
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.520
But since then its population has kept dropping.

155
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:40.330
It's suffered a string of factory closures, uncertainty and rising crime,

156
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:45.130
but no one knew how to stop. The situation continued until the 2009 crisis,

157
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.170
which was the tipping point for many workers.

158
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.180
The city of Detroit ended up in bankruptcy.

159
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:53.290
These were difficult times where day after day one could see news as horrific as

160
00:08:53.291 --> 00:08:54.124
this.

161
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:01.200
<v 0>Detroit home sell for $1 amid mortgage and car industry crisis.</v>

162
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:01.910
The guardian.

163
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.760
<v 1>The federal government was forced to intervene to do something.</v>

164
00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.670
And in those years it was the government of Barack Obama. Well,

165
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.600
actually the president was a Barack Obama and the vice president was Joe Biden.

166
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.050
Yes,

167
00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:15.710
the same man who is now running against Donald Trump public money was used to

168
00:09:15.711 --> 00:09:17.600
bail out general motors and Chrysler,

169
00:09:17.601 --> 00:09:21.380
which were bankrupt Ford also had to take out a loan to avoid bankruptcy.

170
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.220
These rescue packages meant an injection of $80 billion of which approximately

171
00:09:25.221 --> 00:09:25.950
10 billion.

172
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:26.783
<v 0>And never recovered.</v>

173
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:34.640
<v 1>This rescue strategy did manage to recover a key sector for Michigan's economy.</v>

174
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.780
This rescue was so important that it became the main player of the 2012 super

175
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.860
bowl. In case you don't know,

176
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.460
the Superbowl is the most important game in American football and the ads that

177
00:09:43.461 --> 00:09:46.700
are broadcast during the breaks are the most expensive of the year.

178
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:51.680
Well in 2012 Chrysler hired the one and only Clint Eastwood to star in

179
00:09:51.681 --> 00:09:52.370
this commercial.

180
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.160
<v 0>Sure. The people of Detroit know a little something about this.</v>

181
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.500
They almost lost everything,

182
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:04.130
but we all pull together. Now motor city is fighting again.

183
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:06.290
<v 1>Of course,</v>

184
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:11.060
Detroit is still a shadow of what it was in 1950 and workers still fear

185
00:10:11.061 --> 00:10:11.900
losing their jobs.

186
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:16.190
That's why Trump's speeches about America first and the attacks on China and the

187
00:10:16.191 --> 00:10:19.580
crackdown on factories relocating to Mexico sounded so appealing.

188
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.860
Those workers who were afraid of losing their jobs,

189
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:25.910
threw themselves into the arms of the only one who seemed willing to prevent the

190
00:10:25.911 --> 00:10:26.744
factory relocate.

191
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:27.913
<v 0>Patients.</v>

192
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.180
<v 1>I don't know what you're thinking.</v>

193
00:10:32.181 --> 00:10:35.540
All politicians make promises in elections promises. They never keep,

194
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.360
but we must realize this, at least in this regard,

195
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.430
Donald Trump has not fooled anyone.

196
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:44.840
Donald Trump promised a strong hand against China and Mexico and America first

197
00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.840
has translated into very concrete measures. On the one hand,

198
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.110
the renegotiation of the North American free trade agreement.

199
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.960
And of course the ongoing trade war against China,

200
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:58.370
it seemed that it lost someone cared about the working class in the United

201
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:01.700
States, that someone had listened to the workers and was finally taking action.

202
00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.100
They were finally giving them what they wanted,

203
00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.530
But you know the saying,

204
00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.040
be careful what you wish for trying to stock trade against China has not brought

205
00:11:13.041 --> 00:11:16.040
jobs back to the United States. Quite the contrary, check this out.

206
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:24.230
<v 0>Michigan business owners say Trump's tariffs have mucked up the works</v>

207
00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.100
Detroit news.

208
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:28.010
<v 1>In the days before the Corona virus, people used to say Trump,</v>

209
00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.920
maybe many things, but the economy is better than ever.

210
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.650
Or the stock market with Trump has gone up like crazy.

211
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.430
And yes it has for technology companies. If you work Amazon, Google,

212
00:11:37.431 --> 00:11:39.650
or Microsoft, or your job is more than secure,

213
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.940
but for people who work in Michigan,

214
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.400
the stock market makes little difference in their life.

215
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:46.400
What matters to them is what happens to the automobile industry.

216
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:49.640
And this has been one of the big losers in the trade war to give you an idea

217
00:11:49.641 --> 00:11:54.550
before the Corona virus Michigan's car factories had already shed $2,100,

218
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.330
but this happened before the coronavirus. Well right now, we're going to.

219
00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.250
<v 2>See where it stands today.</v>

220
00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.450
<v 1>No, no virus on wheels. When the Corona virus health crisis arrived,</v>

221
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.320
Trump did not want to take action. The governor of Michigan did Democrat.

222
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:14.400
Gretchen Whitmer ordered the third longest confinement in the United States.

223
00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:18.450
And yet the state of Michigan has recorded more than 7,000 deaths from COVID-19.

224
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.870
The toughest restrictions were imposed when the coronavirus was already running

225
00:12:21.871 --> 00:12:25.800
rampant, April was terrible in Michigan, but 150 deaths every day.

226
00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.550
And you may be wondering, but get the confinement prevent more deaths. Sure,

227
00:12:29.551 --> 00:12:33.420
of course it did. But there were also strong protests against the quarantine.

228
00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:34.320
Was there an alternative?

229
00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:35.543
<v 2>I believe so.</v>

230
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:43.290
<v 1>Michigan were held in their homes for 70 days from late March until early June.</v>

231
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:45.750
And this has mostly affected workers in industry.

232
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.790
Detroit is located in Wayne County,

233
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.120
which accounts for 18% of Michigan's population. However,

234
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:55.050
Wayne County accounts for 25% of the positive test results in Michigan for

235
00:12:55.860 --> 00:13:00.060
COVID-19 and 40% of the deaths. But we are not only talking about lives lost.

236
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:01.350
We are also talking about the.

237
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:02.333
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

238
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.950
<v 1>And unemployment rate tops 22% worse than great recession.</v>

239
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.250
Detroit news unemployment has now recovered to 8%,

240
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:14.100
but it's still double the 4% it was before the pandemic.

241
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.310
And if it doesn't recover more, it's largely because of Trump's policies,

242
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:21.600
agriculture and industry continue to be waved down by the effects of the trade

243
00:13:21.601 --> 00:13:25.380
war with China, agricultural products are being hurt by tariffs.

244
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:29.040
Industry has seen its export shrink as the materials that you use is become more

245
00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:30.300
expensive. And again,

246
00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:34.380
higher prices are paid by farmers who have to bear higher prices when buying

247
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:35.880
machinery, as you can imagine,

248
00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:39.540
all this generates discontent among the workers and uneasiness that only

249
00:13:39.541 --> 00:13:43.290
increases when they see the trade war has only generated problems.

250
00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:47.130
<v 2>And that.</v>

251
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.380
<v 1>When the citizens of Michigan asks themselves,</v>

252
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:52.170
what is the alternative to Donald Trump?

253
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.600
And this is where Joe Biden comes in.

254
00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:58.410
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

255
00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:02.220
<v 1>Joe Biden's first advantage is that is not Hillary Clinton. Yes.</v>

256
00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.460
The worst news for Trump is that Biden is not Hillary Clinton.

257
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:08.610
Clinton generated a lot of rejection, not Biden,

258
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.910
but above all Biden's greatest asset is the situation.

259
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:16.890
The 2016 election was framed in terms of what do you want to stay the same with

260
00:14:16.891 --> 00:14:19.740
the lifelong political class that Hillary Clinton represents,

261
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:24.150
or to try something new with Donald Trump, the businessman from TV in Michigan,

262
00:14:24.151 --> 00:14:27.150
those who bet on novelty came out on top, but four years later,

263
00:14:27.151 --> 00:14:29.610
it seems they are not so convinced what's more.

264
00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.700
The pandemic has created a critical situation in which the Democrats are

265
00:14:32.701 --> 00:14:36.690
exploiting Biden's experience as vice president during the last financial crisis

266
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:37.763
of 2009.

267
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:43.420
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

268
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.950
<v 1>The fact that it was Biden who pushed through the rescue plan that saved</v>

269
00:14:46.951 --> 00:14:49.620
Michigan's auto industry. A plan that by the way,

270
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.880
it was voted down by Mike Pence, Trump's vice president.

271
00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:57.130
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

272
00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:00.670
<v 1>So Michigan is one of the most important battlegrounds for Trump and Biden.</v>

273
00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.010
Four years ago, Trump came to the white house,

274
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:07.270
thanks to the surprise victories in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,

275
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:11.590
but in Michigan, he did so by a mere 10,700 votes.

276
00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.790
And in the other two States,

277
00:15:12.791 --> 00:15:16.240
the margins were pretty minimal to in total Trump's victory.

278
00:15:16.241 --> 00:15:18.880
In these three States was 67,000 votes.

279
00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.720
We are talking about 46 electoral college voters who if they had fallen to the

280
00:15:22.721 --> 00:15:26.350
democratic side would have completely changed the outcome of the election.

281
00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.440
That's why a few thousand votes in Michigan may be crucial to Trump's or

282
00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:33.190
button's victory. And the question, how is the campaign going well.

283
00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.600
<v 0>Politics in the time of COVID.</v>

284
00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:44.530
<v 1>It's rare to see two such different ways of dealing with an election campaign,</v>

285
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.440
a pandemic and life in general, in Michigan,

286
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.650
the polls give Biden a clear lead of about seven points so far.

287
00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:54.280
So Trump has gone on the attack as if he were general Custer himself.

288
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:57.490
The current president's supporters have pulled out of the seventh cavalry to

289
00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:01.120
attack Biden and have called him out for everything. And I do mean everything.

290
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.040
Even Peter affilia, Andrew May ask yourself,

291
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.850
so how is Biden responding well by doing practically nothing.

292
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.513
<v 0>That's right.</v>

293
00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.350
<v 1>But strategy is very low profile.</v>

294
00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.930
You could say it's one of the least aggressive campaigns in history.

295
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.650
You might imagine that Biden wants to be seen as a great reformer or a camera's

296
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.130
metric leader, but he's doing just the opposite. His message is,

297
00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.200
do you want to go back to a professional politician? Well,

298
00:16:26.201 --> 00:16:27.640
here I am to give you an idea.

299
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:31.480
Biden's campaign is so boring that even his supporters are getting nervous.

300
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.240
<v 0>Michael Moore sounds alarm on Biden's campaign in Michigan.</v>

301
00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:40.540
It's actually worse than Hillary's Fox news.

302
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.860
<v 1>Widen has promised Michigan 1 million automotive jobs with his build back better</v>

303
00:16:44.861 --> 00:16:46.240
agenda. And that's about it.

304
00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.790
His campaign is betting everything on digital messaging,

305
00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.220
under the guise of keeping a safe distance from voters.

306
00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:53.830
Something that suits him pretty well, because let's be honest,

307
00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:55.690
Biden's not exactly the life of the party.

308
00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:59.920
So Biden's campaign is investing a lot of money in TV ads and social media,

309
00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:01.330
just the opposite of Trump.

310
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.080
The president's campaign canceled its television ads in Michigan in July many

311
00:17:05.081 --> 00:17:08.080
interpreted the move as giving up the battle in the state.

312
00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.880
After having seen Biden's lead in the past.

313
00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:15.400
<v 0>On.</v>

314
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.660
<v 1>Because Republicans are repeating the 2016 strategy in that election,</v>

315
00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.450
they saved the bombardment of ads for the final days.

316
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.540
They focused on key States in October to turn the polls around.

317
00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:29.230
And the truth is that they succeeded. However, this time it's different.

318
00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:32.290
You may be wondering. So does Trump have a winning proposal for Michigan?

319
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:35.440
Not really is keeping the same narrative as in 2016,

320
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.380
I'm going to stop China from stealing your jobs to be Frank.

321
00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:42.850
We could say that the Republican campaign is too similar to that of 2016.

322
00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:45.700
It seems that the pandemic has not factored in their strategy at all.

323
00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:47.200
Their supporters are going door to door,

324
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.890
trying to convince potential voters of the president's virtues,

325
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.970
completely ignoring social distancing protocols. And as soon as they can,

326
00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.740
they hold mass events. True.

327
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.710
One such event took place in an open air airport hangar,

328
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.950
but gathering more than 5,000 people in one place. For any reason,

329
00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:05.550
doesn't seem like a good idea these days. Trump seems to think it's a good idea.

330
00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:12.290
<v 4>No, this is not the crowd of a person who comes in</v>

331
00:18:12.291 --> 00:18:16.130
second place. You do know that the same thing happened four years ago.

332
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:18.950
<v 1>Swords are still drawn in Michigan.</v>

333
00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.860
So of course we'll be keeping an eye on what unfolds in November,

334
00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:23.420
but now the questions are over to you.

335
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:27.110
Do you think voters should judge Trump for his presidency by ignoring the

336
00:18:27.111 --> 00:18:31.490
pandemic? Do you think the results in Michigan will be so close again? In fact,

337
00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:32.780
if you were Michigan,

338
00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.920
would you stick with Trump or would you bet on Biden leave your answers in the

339
00:18:36.921 --> 00:18:40.460
comments? So I really hope you enjoyed this video. Please hit, like if you did,
