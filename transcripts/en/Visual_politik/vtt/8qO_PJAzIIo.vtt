00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.840
<v 0>They call it the roof of the world.</v>

2
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.940
And it is one of the most isolated lens on the planet.

3
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.920
Surrounded by the world's highest mountains to bet has forever been a Lund of

4
00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:23.820
monks on new months, a place seemingly frozen forever in tight.

5
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.480
<v 1>I consider it.</v>

6
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.930
It's kind of surprising that such a mysterious place can have such an impact on

7
00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:34.700
international politics around the world.

8
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.760
Political activists hire the free Tibet flags and they wear t-shirts with the

9
00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:39.410
logo embossed on the front. Meanwhile,

10
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.130
China is using all of its considerable political power to keep Tibet as part of

11
00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.830
his territory. But why is this land so important? Does it have oil?

12
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.950
Does it have gold? No, it's got absolutely nothing. And this video,

13
00:00:48.951 --> 00:00:49.850
we will tell you the story.

14
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.103
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

15
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.430
<v 1>We should ask ourselves here is who on earth thought it was a good idea to</v>

16
00:01:01.431 --> 00:01:04.700
settle into bet. I mean, who's the first genius who said, Hey guys,

17
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.630
gather round. However,

18
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.080
we crossed the world's highest mountains while we freeze our asses off.

19
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.270
And then we start a human settlement on the other site.

20
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.110
And the middle of nowhere who's with me, starting a civilization was not enough.

21
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.860
We also managed to build more than 6,000 beautiful Buddhist temples and the most

22
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.190
unexplainable places you could possibly imagine. Yes. Brands of visual politics.

23
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.740
There are many inexplicable things about Tibet. In fact,

24
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.440
there are many things we don't know about a bit starting from the fact that the

25
00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:30.380
name itself refers to three different things. First of all,

26
00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:32.390
we have the Tibetan plateau, a massive area,

27
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.650
five times the size of France for an average elevation of 5,000 meters.

28
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.740
That's high enough to skydive from. So I'm told I've never been skydiving.

29
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.390
I'm scared of Heights. As you can see,

30
00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:43.580
much of the plateau is shared with several other countries,

31
00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:44.990
such as Bhutan and Pakistan,

32
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.080
and the area is home to other cultures and religions beyond just the Tibetans

33
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.620
and Buddhism. But as you know, Tibet is much more than an exotic place.

34
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.890
When talking about politics and Tibet, we usually refer to this Tibet.

35
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.990
This is known as the Tibet autonomous region or T a R as its name suggests as an

36
00:02:02.991 --> 00:02:07.010
administrative area of China, but make no mistake is not actually autonomous.

37
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.040
The Chinese communist party rules. This region with an iron fist,

38
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.400
many Tibetans don't even have a passport. So they cannot travel abroad.

39
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.760
Their mother tongue has been completely bombed and most of those 6,000 beautiful

40
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:19.160
monasteries have been utterly demolished. Unfortunately,

41
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.890
none of this is really breaking news. I mean, what did you expect?

42
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.210
It's this China we're talking about.

43
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.060
They're not well-known for dealing with this end lately. In fact,

44
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.810
Tibetans are not the only minority group marginalized by Beijing. Then again,

45
00:02:29.811 --> 00:02:32.540
Tibet as extremely important to their political agenda.

46
00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:34.040
And the main reason is this man.

47
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.110
<v 0>89 Dalai Lama wins the Nobel peace prize. New York times.</v>

48
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.800
<v 1>Lama is the religious leader of Tibetan Buddhism and the leader of the Tibetan</v>

49
00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:48.980
government in exile. He wants the tar to separate from China,

50
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.450
but I'm sure you already know this.

51
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.460
Everybody knows the Dalai Lama and why wouldn't he?

52
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.580
He's got such a cool haircut, which he called me from me. Just let it be known.

53
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.600
In 2013,

54
00:02:56.601 --> 00:02:59.830
a pollster company called Harris conducted a survey with the most popular

55
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:03.850
leaders. The Dalai Lama came out in joint first place alongside Barack Obama.

56
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.970
This is surprising giving it to bet has just over 3 million people.

57
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:08.590
And it's almost impossible to reach.

58
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.860
You would be for Gavin for expecting to bet to be one of those unknown places

59
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.870
where human rights are violated all the time.

60
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.630
But you only heard about here on visual politics and one of our videos.

61
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.291
For example,

62
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:19.900
have you ever seen a demonstration in support of the rights of the younger

63
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:21.400
minority in China? Chances are,

64
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.170
you don't even know the people I'm talking about.

65
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.590
And yet the free Tibet campaign has gained the support of lots of influential

66
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:29.440
people, including Hollywood celebrities, like Richard Gere here in the city,

67
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:31.330
where I live in Prague in the Czech Republic,

68
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.940
you can see flags hanging out of windows that say three Tibet.

69
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.000
And if you think waving this flag has no political consequences.

70
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.360
You had better think again. Remember, this is China. We're talking about.

71
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.230
<v 2>Bangladesh show covers up to bet Nard after China complainants</v>

72
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.510
train his revenge for Prague's supports of Tibet,

73
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.900
trying to complains to us over lawmakers, visit the Dalai Lama.

74
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.260
<v 1>The thing about all of this as is that China has plenty of other international</v>

75
00:04:04.261 --> 00:04:06.570
problems to deal with. Do you want territorial conflicts?

76
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.600
You've got the dispute with Japan on the East China sea and ongoing border

77
00:04:09.601 --> 00:04:12.300
clashes with India to the South. Want to hear about oppressed of minorities?

78
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.450
You can read about the year, my naughty every day in the newspapers. Yes,

79
00:04:15.451 --> 00:04:18.030
dear viewers Tibet is not China's only problem,

80
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.130
but China takes a bet very seriously.

81
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.410
Even talking about it with N Jayna is prohibited,

82
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.680
which by the way is also a rule that applies to talking about my teeth and the

83
00:04:25.681 --> 00:04:28.890
comments I'm British. What did you all expect outside of China?

84
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.040
Naming this specific problem as a synonym for having a diplomatic?

85
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.290
<v 2>Okay. You might wonder.</v>

86
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.300
<v 1>Why is it because of economics? I mean,</v>

87
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.750
not really debate is chain poorest region. Is it because of oil? Not really.

88
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.870
So what then? Why is China so invested in keeping Tibet in the territory?

89
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.450
Why is this such a huge deal in international politics?

90
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.770
It's China really entitled to claim Tibet as a region and this video,

91
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.210
we are going to answer all of these questions, but before we do,

92
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.380
let's take a look back at something.

93
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.040
<v 2>Last corner of the earth.</v>

94
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.710
<v 1>Does the name [inaudible] ring a bell for you?</v>

95
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.630
This is the name of the Dalai Lama. In fact,

96
00:05:06.631 --> 00:05:08.640
seeing Dalai Lama is like saying the Pope,

97
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.770
just like the Pope is the head of the Catholic Christianity.

98
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.930
The Dalai Lama is the head of Tibet and Buddhism.

99
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.420
And just like the Pope is the leader of the Vatican States.

100
00:05:15.421 --> 00:05:18.600
The Dalai Lama is the political leader of the Tibetan government in exile.

101
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.150
It's a fun fact for you. Well,

102
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.880
how well do you think Tenzin was when he was named Dalai Lama?

103
00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.700
The answer is he was five years old. Yes, dear viewers,

104
00:05:29.701 --> 00:05:33.540
the Dalai Lama is not elected democratically and he's not even choosing by luck

105
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:34.350
of inheritance.

106
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.070
The Dalai Lama is the reincarnation of a goddess who has such a complicated

107
00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:41.370
name. I'm not even going to try to pronounce it because let's face facts.

108
00:05:41.371 --> 00:05:44.820
I can barely speak English as it is. So once the title I Lama passes away,

109
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.910
the religious authorities start looking for the next human and to whom the Dalai

110
00:05:47.911 --> 00:05:49.980
Lama has been reincarnated, which by the way,

111
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.230
is how we choose new hosts here on visual politic.

112
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.900
And how do they recognize that? I don't know, ask it to bet in Buddhist.

113
00:05:54.901 --> 00:05:57.470
I just looked like one, but once they find the true Lama,

114
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.060
they crone him as the King of Tibet.

115
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.330
And then he will rule the country as the absolute Monarch until he passes away.

116
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.880
<v 0>Okay.</v>

117
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.840
<v 1>Political system Tibet has had since 1391 in the meantime,</v>

118
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.510
Tibet has been conquered by the Mongolians and the Chinese,

119
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.630
but it kept that feudal and theocratic system almost untouched.

120
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.480
They just paid tribute to the Chinese dynasties that controlled them basically

121
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.090
for centuries. Nobody really cared.

122
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.660
<v 0>Tibet.</v>

123
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:29.650
<v 1>So isolated and hard to reach the Buddhism or religion famously associated with</v>

124
00:06:29.651 --> 00:06:32.860
Tibet. Didn't actually reach the Tibetans until the seventh century a D.

125
00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.740
This is over a thousand years after Buddhism was funded.

126
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.400
Tibet developed a feudal system where local chiefs shared power with monks and

127
00:06:39.401 --> 00:06:40.030
monasteries.

128
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.500
That's explains why until recently they had more than 600,000 monks and nuns and

129
00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:48.670
a population of as few as 2.5 million inhabitants modern technology didn't

130
00:06:48.671 --> 00:06:52.330
arrive until very recently, but all of this changed and the 20th century,

131
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.640
first between 1912 and 1950,

132
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.010
the Chinese dynasties completely withdrew from Tibet.

133
00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.550
It seemed that this country could be completely sovereign forever and even more

134
00:07:00.551 --> 00:07:03.730
isolated. But as you know, destiny had other plans for Tibetans.

135
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.400
<v 3>This war without bloodshed, while war is politics with bloodshed mouths,</v>

136
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.333
they don't.

137
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.580
<v 1>October 6th, 1950, the Chinese people's liberation army crossed,</v>

138
00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.280
entered Tibet and inflicted a crushing defeat on the Tibetan army.

139
00:07:21.281 --> 00:07:22.960
There was no need for a genius strategy here.

140
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.700
China had about 550 million inhabitants. Well, Tibet had less than 2.5 million.

141
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:28.120
Also.

142
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.480
It's a better than government having taken an extreme isolation as policy had no

143
00:07:31.481 --> 00:07:32.830
international allies to aid them.

144
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.530
So despite Tibet being an easily defensible location,

145
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.110
it was really terribly easy to conquer them out of the time,

146
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.350
the 14th Dalai Lama, the same one we have today was only about 16.

147
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.940
And he sent a delegation to Beijing to negotiate. A deal has approval.

148
00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:49.750
This delegation,

149
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.600
which also wasn't allowed to communicate back to the Tibetan government,

150
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:56.290
signed the 17 point agreement. This agreement resulted in China,

151
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.010
annexing to banks, but it left the area with some actual autonomy,

152
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.000
similar to the situation in Hong Kong today,

153
00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:04.450
the Dalai Lama could remain in power and the traditional Tibetan system known as

154
00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:07.750
the cache. It could remain in place. And so I know what you're thinking so far,

155
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.130
nothing's really changed, right?

156
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.250
For centuries to best leaders had a free reign to rule their country as long as

157
00:08:12.251 --> 00:08:14.560
they would pay tribute to whoever ruled China first,

158
00:08:14.561 --> 00:08:17.290
it was the aristocratic dynasties. And now it's the communists.

159
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.600
What's the difference? The difference is, and the details.

160
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:26.560
<v 0>Of course.</v>

161
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.790
<v 1>To the Chinese communist party,</v>

162
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.100
only part of Tibet to could have that degree of autonomy,

163
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.680
but the East of the country would fall under most reforms.

164
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.980
So the people living in those areas rebelled against communist rule using

165
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:37.180
guerrilla warfare tactics.

166
00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:40.090
This was made worse when the rebellion began to spread through the rest of

167
00:08:40.091 --> 00:08:44.050
Tibet. So in 1959, males are dong said, you know what the hell with autonomy,

168
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.470
let's give these Tibetans some real liberation on March 17th,

169
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.230
Chinese artillery shells struck near the Dalai Lama's palace,

170
00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.620
which prompted attempt to flee to India disguised under cover of darkness.

171
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:54.610
Of course, this anger,

172
00:08:54.611 --> 00:08:57.840
Tibetans who loved the religious leader and they began large scale protests,

173
00:08:57.841 --> 00:08:59.190
which eventually turned to violence.

174
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.550
As you can probably imagine the Chinese communist army responded in a very

175
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:05.460
Chinese communist way, total brutal repression.

176
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.350
And what do you think happened next? I mean, think about it.

177
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.800
We are talking about the end of the 1950s in the middle of the cold war.

178
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:14.310
On one hand, we have a communist country invading a non-communist country.

179
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.800
This was a golden window of opportunity for.

180
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:26.600
<v 0>[Inaudible] CIA gave aid to Tibetan exiles and sixties files</v>

181
00:09:26.601 --> 00:09:27.434
show.

182
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.920
<v 1>Oh, no one ever expects the CIA. So yes,</v>

183
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.310
the U S armed the Tibet and rebels and subsidize the Dalai Lama while he was

184
00:09:34.311 --> 00:09:35.120
living in exile.

185
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.710
The CIA spent more than 1.7 million us dollars a year supporting the free Tibet

186
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:44.420
by a hundred thousand us dollars went to Armenia gorillas and 180,000 us dollars

187
00:09:44.421 --> 00:09:47.990
went to the Dalai Lama. This is how this regional conflict turned international.

188
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.920
All of a sudden the whole world knew about the Dalai Lama and free Tibet became

189
00:09:51.921 --> 00:09:54.380
one of the most popular human rights campaigns worldwide.

190
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.520
While in exile in India,

191
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:58.940
the Dalai Lama created a Tibetan library and made Tibetan Buddhism known in

192
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.190
unexpected places like the us and Europe.

193
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.410
I'm sure many of you have a Tibetan Mandela home,

194
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.600
or you have a friend who has Lotus flowers in their bedroom.

195
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:06.560
If you do a Google search,

196
00:10:06.561 --> 00:10:09.830
you will find lots of websites and newspapers supporting the Tibetan codes and

197
00:10:09.831 --> 00:10:13.020
Hollywood celebrities have been extremely vocal on this topic. Just check.

198
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:22.250
<v 0>Saving Tibet. You save the possibility that we are all brothers, sisters,</v>

199
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:23.270
Richard Gere,

200
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:30.290
Steven Seagal, top action hero, and to Betten llama.

201
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:34.520
<v 1>By the way, as a fun fact, all of this American AIDS stopped in 1972.</v>

202
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.400
The very same year that the white house started diplomatic relations with

203
00:10:37.401 --> 00:10:40.670
continental China. So now you may wonder there was all this free Tibet movement,

204
00:10:40.671 --> 00:10:42.050
just a CIA conspiracy.

205
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.960
Was it just a way to destabilize communist China during the cold war?

206
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.350
Have we been manipulated all this tight? The fact that the CIA was involved,

207
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.170
it does not mean China didn't act inappropriately towards Tibetans.

208
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.710
So let's keep going. The last set of Tibet and uprising ended in 1962,

209
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.490
by then it's estimated that the Chinese army had looted and destroyed over 6,000

210
00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.850
Tibetan monasteries and killed perhaps as many as 87,000 Tibetans,

211
00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:06.830
But that wasn't the end of it.

212
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:11.690
In 1966 Mao's cultural revolution began 15 years later, there were only eight.

213
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.180
Yes, eight functioning monasteries left in Tibet,

214
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:17.240
where there had previously been thousands and 1950 as believed.

215
00:11:17.241 --> 00:11:21.200
There were as many as 600,000 Tibetan monks and nuns. And by 1979,

216
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:25.160
they were almost all debt. The damage is almost impossible to understate,

217
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.050
but this raises the question. Why,

218
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.990
why are the Chinese so determined to keep ahold of Tibet? Let's have a look,

219
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:30.853
shall we.

220
00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:36.800
<v 0>[Inaudible] access of Asia?</v>

221
00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:41.000
<v 1>Why does China want to bet even today to bet ranks lowest on the human</v>

222
00:11:41.001 --> 00:11:41.811
development index?

223
00:11:41.811 --> 00:11:45.710
I have all of China's 31 provinces and a significant portion of the population

224
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.430
holds a real resentment toward the ruling communist party to boot well and true

225
00:11:49.431 --> 00:11:52.370
visual politic fashion. The answer is both complicated and simple.

226
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.360
Let's have a look at a up again and get ready for some terrible pronunciation.

227
00:11:59.820 --> 00:11:59.910
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

228
00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:00.630
<v 1>See all this.</v>

229
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.720
These are the many rivers fed by the ice melt from the Tibetan plateau.

230
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.640
These rivers include the youngest and the yellow,

231
00:12:05.641 --> 00:12:08.400
the two most important rivers in China. Also the Metcon,

232
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:12.210
which allows Cambodia and Vietnam relay on everybody that sustains Myenmar the

233
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.630
butter and Holy Ganges of Bangladesh and India. The end is the defiance,

234
00:12:15.631 --> 00:12:16.230
Pakistan,

235
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.740
and many other smaller ones that nourish places like the Oasis of the Taran

236
00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.490
basin. So you see why it's so important now, whoever controls, Tibet controls,

237
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.270
almost all of Asia's fresh water and the water that about half of the world's

238
00:12:27.271 --> 00:12:29.490
population relies on. And as you can imagine,

239
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.040
China knows how to use such a strategic resource.

240
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:36.780
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

241
00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.570
<v 2>And it completes Tibet speakers, hydro power plants.</v>

242
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:44.280
<v 1>China now has around 87,000 water dumps. Two thirds of those are built into bed,</v>

243
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:48.120
and that's not all in 2007, the Chinese government found large mineral deposits.

244
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.720
And we've seen that Tibet is home to large amounts of gold copper lead and zinc

245
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:52.583
so much. In fact,

246
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.280
that it may account for about half of all of China's copper and zinc. Of course,

247
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.500
there are several environmental concerns linked to all this.

248
00:12:58.501 --> 00:13:01.320
And India is worried about the Chinese control of Asian waters.

249
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.070
At the end of the day.

250
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.800
Many of those rivers that stream from Tibet are the lifeblood.

251
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:10.620
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

252
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:10.621
<v 1>No,</v>

253
00:13:10.621 --> 00:13:13.110
you might be thinking you might be thinking it doesn't sound so bad after all

254
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.630
grants being invaded by China is not great,

255
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.990
but why if that invasion brings money and jobs to the people that's not so bad.

256
00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.270
Let's be honest though, here prior to the Chinese invasion,

257
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.130
Tibet was far from a good place to live.

258
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.610
And if you look at the pure statistics to best GDP has been growing a constant

259
00:13:26.611 --> 00:13:28.890
two digit rate for more than 25 years.

260
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.950
That's a lot of money and jobs were the problem with that. Then, well,

261
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.010
most of that money and most of those jobs go straight to the ethnic.

262
00:13:35.011 --> 00:13:36.600
Chinese who have migrated to TV.

263
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:42.930
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

264
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:45.330
<v 1>Steer viewers, race matters a lot in China.</v>

265
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:48.090
90% of the best population are ethnically Tibetan.

266
00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.430
Only 8% belong to the hand minority,

267
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.710
which is the majority race throughout the rest of China.

268
00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.860
Most of those ethnic Chinese immigrated to the region after the envision.

269
00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.950
And those are the ones who get to work and all of those better paying jobs,

270
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.810
the rest of the Tibetans remain pure.

271
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.880
So basically if you belong to the Tibetans majority.

272
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.740
<v 0>This is what you get from all of them.</v>

273
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:09.390
[inaudible].

274
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:11.640
<v 2>Nomads, forcibly resettled by China,</v>

275
00:14:11.641 --> 00:14:15.570
struggle with loss of an over 8,000 year old heritage.

276
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.070
First post 29.

277
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:20.490
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

278
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:24.300
<v 2>Ends in anguish as Chinese minds pollutes their sacred grass.</v>

279
00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.960
It's a large lithium mine, not only desecrates,

280
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:32.400
the sacred grasslands villagers say, but spawns, deadly pollution.

281
00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:36.930
The river used to be full of fish today. There are hardly any hundreds of yaks.

282
00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.250
The villagers say have died in the past few years after drinking Riverwalk,

283
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.380
the Washington post 2016.

284
00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:46.560
<v 1>So according to a census conducted by Beijing university,</v>

285
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:50.130
only 1% of Tibetans have immigrated to the rest of China by 2010.

286
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.540
And the few who made it usually had a hard time finding a good job in cities

287
00:14:53.541 --> 00:14:56.540
like Shanghai or Beijing. Basically that means if you are to Tibetans,

288
00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.450
you have few opportunities at home and even fewer in China,

289
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.810
all of this explains why despite China's efforts to suppress the bet and culture

290
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.420
many still follow the Dalai Lama. On the other hand,

291
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:08.030
the current Dalai Lama is very different from his predecessors.

292
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.340
He has spent most of his life outside of Tibet.

293
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.520
He's been among Western leaders and this has influenced his political views.

294
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:19.120
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

295
00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.660
<v 2>Dalai Lama, proclaimed success of Tibetan democracy,</v>

296
00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:25.600
handover government duties to elected, to Betten leader.

297
00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:29.290
<v 1>All of this means that if one day the Dalai Lama comes back to Tibet,</v>

298
00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:32.170
he won't be the absolute theocratic Monarch. He was decades ago.

299
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.110
This time he would support a democratic government with a parliament and an

300
00:15:35.111 --> 00:15:36.520
elected leader. But so far,

301
00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.120
it seems very unlikely that China will let Tibetan separatists have their way.

302
00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.730
So no, the question is over to all of you. Well,

303
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.740
it's the battens retain their culture and way of life. Well,

304
00:15:44.741 --> 00:15:48.070
the Dalai Lama ever returned will they achieve independence or even just real

305
00:15:48.071 --> 00:15:50.080
autonomy. Will there ever be a free Tibet?

306
