00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.190
<v 0>This video is brought to you by a news voice.</v>

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.580
The news is broken almost all of the U S media is owned by just a handful of big

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.970
corporations. Fake news is obviously a huge problem as well.

4
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:14.790
And finding something unbiased can be hard.

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.430
News voice is revolutionizing the news landscape.

12
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.130
shapes, which people we trust, what we eat, what we buy, how we vote,

13
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.120
and even how we think news voice is created by its readers.

14
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.310
As you can up vote stories that you find interesting.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.970
And our last side of the way let's get into today's video.

22
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.063
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

23
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.060
<v 0>Thailand is a country capable of attracting Buddhist monks, adventure,</v>

24
00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:20.660
seeking tourists, as well as the teacher mate faint and the hangover part two,

25
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.890
all at the same time,

26
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.280
there are many reasons why we have all heard stories of incredible parties in

27
00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:29.810
Bangkok and not in other places like Brunei or Malaysia reasons like this one.

28
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.520
<v 2>Thailand leads Asia in legalizing medical marijuana. Next year,</v>

29
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.760
Thailand may become first in Southeast Asia to allow same sex

30
00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:45.260
unions, Japan times.

31
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.130
<v 0>Oh yes. Beaches, marijuana, LGBT rights, Thailand.</v>

32
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.200
It seems like the Asian version of California,

33
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.830
but with a monarchy and one that is a little bit easier on the wallet. However,

34
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.100
lately Thailand is in the news for headlines like this.

35
00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.233
<v 1>Yes.</v>

36
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.100
<v 2>The tests and Thailand are making history for the first time in decades.</v>

37
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.390
People are openly defying the authority of the monarchy. Al Jazeera.

38
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.150
<v 0>Give you an idea of what we're talking about. Since July 20,</v>

39
00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:18.320
20 thousands of Thai people have taken to the streets to ask for a total change

40
00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:22.730
of regime, change the constitution, reform the monarchy and hold free elections,

41
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.050
fun facts instead of raising their Fest or hunt Thai people raise these three

42
00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:31.070
fingers. And yeah, this is straight out of the hunger games. Movie,

43
00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:33.140
trilogy more about that though later,

44
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.110
but let's get back to our story for just now, because trust me,

45
00:02:36.111 --> 00:02:39.980
when I say that Thai people have no shortage of reasons to protest.

46
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.850
We're talking about one of the most authoritarian countries in the world.

47
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.410
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

48
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.530
<v 0>Thailand's political system is a hybrid between absolute monarchy,</v>

49
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.550
theocracy and military dictatorship sounds fun. Right? In fact,

50
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.060
the Thai Royal house is the richest in the world surpassing even the Petro.

51
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.010
And it has far more power than any European monarchy.

52
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.070
And you're probably thinking, come on, grant, if they're still authoritarian,

53
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.650
how is it possible to have so much tourism? How is it possible?

54
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.000
There are so many digital nomads who go there to live cities like bind Cohn,

55
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.000
and Schine mine are trendy destinations for digital nomads,

56
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.970
which for those who don't know as people who work on lane,

57
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.510
who could live anywhere in the world and who choose to live in Thailand.

58
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.380
And yes, Thailand can be a fantastic country for a westerner.

59
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.740
But if you are tight, you might not think so.

60
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.530
<v 2>Hi man faces lengthy jail term for sarcastic remark about King's</v>

61
00:03:37.531 --> 00:03:38.790
dog Telegraph.

62
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.810
<v 0>You give you an idea.</v>

63
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.840
Thailand has the fourth largest prison population in the world,

64
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.460
just behind Turkmenistan Cuba. And of course the United States.

65
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.290
And just a side note here. Yes,

66
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.830
the United States has the largest prison population in the world,

67
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.310
but we've already talked about that here on visual politic before the irony of

68
00:03:56.311 --> 00:03:58.980
the freest country in the world, locking up the most people.

69
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.990
The point is that compared to tight residence,

70
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.100
those in the United States look like five star resorts. And as we'll see later,

71
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.440
it's very easy to end up in a Thai prison.

72
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.890
And all this explains such intense protests as this one.

73
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.240
<v 2>Thailand protests thousands rally for third straight day,</v>

74
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.830
despite government ban.

75
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.240
<v 0>However,</v>

76
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.140
none of this news is going to attract much attention and previous visual politic

77
00:04:25.141 --> 00:04:27.210
videos. We have talked about Thai politics.

78
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.320
And if there is one thing that characterizes this country is the regime changes

79
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.000
to give you an idea. Since 1932 Thailand has suffered an average of one Q data.

80
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.480
Every four years, regime changes are so commonplace in this country,

81
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.880
but they don't even make the news anymore. However,

82
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.560
these protests are special and maybe just maybe this time we will

83
00:04:46.561 --> 00:04:51.240
see real regime change, pay attention because today's video has everything,

84
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.650
economics, living, gods and sex, lots of sex,

85
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.920
and even a couple of extra floozy thrown in for good measure.

86
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.210
So the question we're asking today are what makes these protests so significant?

87
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.160
What are the protestors asking for?

88
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.740
What is the real problem in Thailand and why,

89
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.630
why have they adopted the hunger games salute as a form of protest today?

90
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.310
We're going to answer all of these questions,

91
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.320
but first let's take a look at some history.

92
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:23.693
<v 2>Design command.</v>

93
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.540
<v 0>This is not the first time that we've talked about theocracy on visual politic</v>

94
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.300
and many other countries such as Saudi Arabia or Iran,

95
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.970
religion and politics go hand in hand. However,

96
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.850
the case of Thailand goes much further than that.

97
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.680
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

98
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.430
<v 0>In this case,</v>

99
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.690
the Thai King is considered as the direct representation of God on earth,

100
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.940
pure and simple. In fact,

101
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.380
the current King of Thailand is known as Ramah X ran at a 10th before him,

102
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.510
there was Ramah I X I'm in the ninth.

103
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.310
And so on all the way back to Rama at the first rum as the name given after the

104
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:01.820
coronation. And it's literally the time name for the goddess Vishal.

105
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.400
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

106
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.230
<v 0>To give you an idea until 1932 Thailand was an absolute monarchy. Since then,</v>

107
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.720
there has been a constitution that limits the power of the King,

108
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.250
but even so the Monique still has a lot of power. I mean, at the end of the day,

109
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.473
he's a goat.

110
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.620
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

111
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.000
<v 0>However, divine, they may be tied. Kings are moved by very human passions,</v>

112
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.630
King Rama,

113
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.290
the ninth also known by his first name [inaudible] was chromed when he was 23

114
00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:36.640
years old, after someone murdered his older brother Ramah the eighth night,

115
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.730
this all might sound crazy in and of itself, but wait,

116
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.590
because you haven't seen anything yet,

117
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.470
it would be logical to think that Rama,

118
00:06:47.471 --> 00:06:51.790
the ninth also known as Lord upon our heads or Lord of life was born in

119
00:06:51.791 --> 00:06:55.570
Thailand, right after all he is the King of a country. Well,

120
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.680
that would be a big mistake rather than ninth was born in Cambridge,

121
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.270
Massachusetts later,

122
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.330
his family moved to Switzerland where he studied at the university there.

123
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.210
So let's take a second just here to imagine that situation.

124
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.540
This man who's living in the West is white with his Swiss friends and they asked

125
00:07:10.541 --> 00:07:13.900
him, so where are you going to be when you grew up? And he goes me well,

126
00:07:13.901 --> 00:07:17.320
I'm going to dedicate myself to being a data and Thailand, come on lads.

127
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.520
Let's do some shots.

128
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.090
What's more after so many years of education and the West rather than ninth

129
00:07:22.091 --> 00:07:25.360
acquired certain habits specifically, he learned to play gems

130
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.610
And in fact came to compose his own pieces.

131
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:37.060
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

132
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.140
<v 0>Let's get back to our story.</v>

133
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.320
I actually can't imagine if the Thai people consider their King to be a God,

134
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.190
any offense against the monarchy as blossoming or as they call it cranes of

135
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:49.060
Lamaze yest, because this is not a minor issue. Thailand's Lez,

136
00:07:49.061 --> 00:07:51.610
Majesta laws are known to be very generic. That is,

137
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.550
it is not clear what counts as blasphemy and what does not.

138
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:56.980
The only thing they are clear about is the penalties,

139
00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.320
which can be up to 15 years in prison.

140
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.520
And there are cases that are to put it mildly, totally unreasonable.

141
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.880
All the cases I'm going to give you right now are real examples.

142
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.350
So pay attention.

143
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:14.110
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

144
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.560
<v 0>Translating an unauthorized biography of the King two years in prison and</v>

145
00:08:17.561 --> 00:08:21.820
something that King's dog on the internet, 37 years in prison,

146
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.820
serving black paint over a portrait of the King, 10 years in prison.

147
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.910
And hold on because we haven't talked about the cranes of sedition yet,

148
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.780
watch out for the list of things that can land you in jail and Thailand wearing

149
00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:32.560
a red shirt,

150
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.760
eating sandwiches as a form of political protest or showing a piece of paper

151
00:08:36.761 --> 00:08:40.210
that says shooting papers is not a crane. I repeat.

152
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.110
These are all real cases that have put real people and real prisons.

153
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.510
And of course, among these terrible crimes of sedation,

154
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.330
it's this loot from the film, the hunger games.

155
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.030
<v 1>Apparently.</v>

156
00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.210
<v 0>In 2014, some protestors started to use it.</v>

157
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.680
The gesture caught fire among young people since then raising three fingers like

158
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.780
this is a crane.

159
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:11.120
<v 1>No.</v>

160
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:14.270
<v 0>Many of you may be wondering how it is possible that the Thai people have not</v>

161
00:09:14.271 --> 00:09:18.410
risen up against their King before the monarchy and Thailand has existed for

162
00:09:18.411 --> 00:09:21.830
centuries after all. Well, the truth is that until a few years ago,

163
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.630
the King of Thailand was a really popular.

164
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:24.943
<v 1>Finger.</v>

165
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.190
<v 0>You have an idea more than 12 million people went to kangaroo and bowls,</v>

166
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.390
funeral to say goodbye to him.

167
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.630
And remember that Thailand has 64 million inhabitants.

168
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:38.690
That means the on October, the 25th, 2017,

169
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:42.590
one out of every sex Thai people dropped what they were doing to go to the grand

170
00:09:42.591 --> 00:09:45.350
palace and Bangkok to say goodbye to their go at Cambridge.

171
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.650
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

172
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.510
<v 0>In cinemas before seeing a movie type,</v>

173
00:09:53.511 --> 00:09:57.080
people have to stand up and listen to the Royal tight Anthem. And no,

174
00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.230
I know what you're going to see if the monarchy is so popular in the country,

175
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.350
why do they have so many coups? Well, let's take a look at that.

176
00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.173
<v 1>Right now,</v>

177
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.850
a dictatorship every four years.

178
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.780
<v 0>One of the main advantages of democracy as that allows for the change of power</v>

179
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:15.710
without bloodshed,

180
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.530
instead of spending money on weapons for a civil war candidates,

181
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:22.220
spend it on electoral materials. Well, in the absence of democracy,

182
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.410
the opposite is true in Thailand.

183
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.130
Candidates spend as much on weapons as they do elsewhere on advertising.

184
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:33.410
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

185
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.890
<v 0>Thailand has suffered 19 cous since 1930,</v>

186
00:10:36.891 --> 00:10:39.140
two of these 1912 are successful.

187
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.830
And another seven were not all these que de ties follow a similar pattern.

188
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.170
A faction of the army organizes the crew detail.

189
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.780
And it is the King who decides whether he wants to support it or not.

190
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.130
The loser has to go into exile and the winner becomes the country's dictator for

191
00:10:52.131 --> 00:10:55.790
a few years, usually about four. I mean, come on.

192
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.200
They're basically like elections,

193
00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.170
but only one person has the vote and that person.

194
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.393
<v 1>It's the King.</v>

195
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.150
<v 0>Well, these coups have been really violent. For example, in 1973,</v>

196
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:11.180
several students demonstrated against the military government of the time.

197
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:15.200
77 students were massacred and 850 were seriously injured.

198
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:16.303
<v 1>The protest.</v>

199
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:20.090
<v 0>That same night,</v>

200
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:23.270
the Kinga knows that the military government had to resign years later,

201
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.540
the dictator Sonoma kittycat Shaun was exiled. However,

202
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.210
other cues were much more peaceful. For example,

203
00:11:29.211 --> 00:11:33.530
the 1957 coup lasted just a few hours. And this case general salaried thinner,

204
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.950
it sent his loyal troops to take over the most important military facilities.

205
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.800
He was supported by a large group of civilians who were protesting in the

206
00:11:39.801 --> 00:11:43.220
streets hours later. This man became silence. New prime minister.

207
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:47.660
The former leader went into exile in Europe and returned to the country six

208
00:11:47.661 --> 00:11:50.960
years later to become prime minister again. So it seems that in Thailand,

209
00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:55.180
military dictatorships come and go, but thing remains that thing.

210
00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.513
<v 1>It's the monarchy.</v>

211
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.450
<v 0>And you may be wondering, but how can the people there support less system?</v>

212
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.510
Well, one fairly convincing answer is the economy with,

213
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.650
or without a lack of freedom.

214
00:12:07.651 --> 00:12:10.920
And Thailand is one of the richest countries in the region as a comparison,

215
00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:15.330
the GDP or per capita, and partly with purchasing power is around $18,000.

216
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.390
That of the Philippines is less than half $8,500.

217
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.640
And in China has $17,000.

218
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.310
While many parts of China still do not have modern hospitals.

219
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:24.630
Thailand has publicly.

220
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:25.913
<v 1>Guilty.</v>

221
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.500
<v 0>Just to give you an idea while their Vietnamese neighbors were coming out of the</v>

222
00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:33.060
famines in the late 1980s,

223
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:36.540
the ties had the largest automotive and hard drive factories in the region,

224
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.130
not to mention being a real tourist powerhouse in 2018, there were the 10th,

225
00:12:41.131 --> 00:12:44.850
most sophisticated country in the world, far above Japan or Greece.

226
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.690
So how can Thailand have such a relatively developed economy with such a

227
00:12:51.691 --> 00:12:55.800
dreadful political system? Well, mainly for two reasons, it's currency.

228
00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:57.900
The bat is one of the most stable in the world.

229
00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.180
And Thailand has always had good relations with the West,

230
00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.990
particularly with Japan. So now you'll see. So what's changed no grunt.

231
00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.980
Why are these protests so important now? Well, well listen up.

232
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:15.630
<v 1>[Inaudible] the middle income trap.</v>

233
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:18.540
<v 0>October, 2016,</v>

234
00:13:18.541 --> 00:13:22.170
the beloved leader Kang Ram in the ninth died in hospital at the age of 88

235
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.350
In a country. So dependent on a single person,

236
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.650
the death of the King is attain bomb. But in this case,

237
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:34.440
the country was on the verge of approving a new constitution through a

238
00:13:34.441 --> 00:13:35.910
referendum. As you can imagine,

239
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.780
it was a referendum where the army told the citizens which way to vote, because,

240
00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:40.620
well,

241
00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.770
just because that's what Thailand is like and this case and the absence of a

242
00:13:43.771 --> 00:13:44.160
King,

243
00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.300
the military Giunta put a Senate in place and announced free elections and other

244
00:13:48.301 --> 00:13:51.270
words as free as they can be in Thailand,

245
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.940
basically the army would supervise the process,

246
00:13:53.941 --> 00:13:56.110
but at least opposition parties would be able to

247
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.290
What happens when you allow opposition political parties to appear well,

248
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.540
surprise, surprise, new opposition parties,

249
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.210
a marriage for the first time in decades, Thailand's parliament.

250
00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.850
How to democratic opposition party with a major presence.

251
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:15.840
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

252
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.960
<v 0>We are talking about the future forward party founded by Mr.</v>

253
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.390
[inaudible] [inaudible] John Green Quranic.

254
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:27.060
It I'd like to apologize formerly here to all the people of Thailand,

255
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.850
although let's be honest. I don't think I'm going there anytime soon. Anyway,

256
00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.670
this is a formation that proposes a change in the constitution,

257
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.480
but limits the powers of the King guarantees, free elections and human rights.

258
00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:40.200
And in the March, 2019 elections, they got 18% of the vote,

259
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.350
which is not bad considering that there are more than seven major parties that

260
00:14:43.351 --> 00:14:44.820
make up the parliament. In fact,

261
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:48.930
future-forward was left with a third of the political power. As you can imagine,

262
00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:49.793
the Lord

263
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.620
it's one of the most influential leaders right now in Thailand.

264
00:14:59.530 --> 00:14:59.980
You, by the way,

265
00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:03.040
the party's leader is also known in Thailand for being the son of one of the

266
00:15:03.041 --> 00:15:05.890
biggest millionaires in the country, far from working against him.

267
00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.600
This only reinforced his image,

268
00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:10.090
being able to live a life of luxury and be like worries.

269
00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:14.320
He decided to risk everything to improve the country. And believe me,

270
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.070
the risk is [inaudible].

271
00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:22.300
<v 2>His party was banned. He faces jail, but Thailand's ton of torn,</v>

272
00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:26.320
drawn groomed rockets, vows to fight on CNN.

273
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:29.530
<v 0>The news you've just heard. It could mean the end of the future-forward party.</v>

274
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.380
Nevertheless, many things have changed in Thailand.

275
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.680
The first is the economy.

276
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:38.530
Remember I told you that Thailand was one of the most prosperous countries in

277
00:15:38.531 --> 00:15:42.070
the region. Well, it's true. It was well,

278
00:15:42.071 --> 00:15:46.120
all the countries of Southeast Asia are growing array of five or six or 7%

279
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:50.380
Thailand barely exceeds 2% growth in economics. This has a name,

280
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:51.850
the middle income trap.

281
00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:55.630
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

282
00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:56.290
<v 0>That is,</v>

283
00:15:56.290 --> 00:15:59.170
there are many countries that managed to escape from poverty and reach what we

284
00:15:59.171 --> 00:16:01.450
call average income. However,

285
00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.480
they did not manage to make the leap to being a wealthy country countries like

286
00:16:04.481 --> 00:16:08.320
Brazil, Columbia, and Thailand seem to have stagnated due to this situation.

287
00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:09.160
If you remember,

288
00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.450
one of Thailand's main industries is tourism accounts for more than 12% of the

289
00:16:13.451 --> 00:16:17.320
country's GDP. And what is the sector most effected by the Corona virus?

290
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.170
Exactly tourism after tourism.

291
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.980
Another of its main industries in this country as the automotive industry. Well,

292
00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:25.413
check this out.

293
00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:29.390
<v 1>Generally.</v>

294
00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:33.220
<v 2>Motors to lay off all 1500 plant workers in Thailand,</v>

295
00:16:33.221 --> 00:16:35.110
following sale of its factories.

296
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.770
<v 0>We're not just talking about general motors, either triumph.</v>

297
00:16:38.771 --> 00:16:41.890
The motorcycle manufacturers have also closed plants and Thailand,

298
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.600
and many others are threatening to do so

299
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:51.280
In total car production in Thailand has dropped by 30% in 2020,

300
00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:53.770
and its GDP has fallen by more than 12%.

301
00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:57.010
All of this translates to thousands of people being unemployed. However,

302
00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.500
this is not the only thing that has changed in this country.

303
00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:03.850
At the beginning of this video, I promised you sex and Tiera tests.

304
00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:07.180
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

305
00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.820
<v 2>Confined with 20 concubines.</v>

306
00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:10.421
<v 0>Yeah. Well,</v>

307
00:17:10.421 --> 00:17:13.360
that's just how the current King of Thailand has spent the confinement and a

308
00:17:13.361 --> 00:17:17.410
mansion in Germany with 20 concubines. And I know what some of you will say,

309
00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.020
how do you know the all 20 of these women were concubines? Well,

310
00:17:20.021 --> 00:17:22.930
if they were just as servants or even as friends, well,

311
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:26.830
the truth is that King [inaudible] has had a long and well known relationship

312
00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:27.760
with the concubines.

313
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:34.420
<v 2>Ty Playboy King annoyance lover as his official concubine. The times.</v>

314
00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:39.520
<v 0>I would say that they have a collaborator or a special friend, but in Thailand,</v>

315
00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:43.330
they call things by their name, the official concubine. It's as simple as that,

316
00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:47.830
there are even videos on WikiLeaks where you can see, you can see a lot.

317
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.420
In fact, you can see everything about this King, of course, on visual politic.

318
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.640
We're not interested in judging everyone's sex life.

319
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.440
As long as he isn't breaking any laws,

320
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.340
this man can do whatever he wants and believe us. He does not remember that.

321
00:17:59.341 --> 00:18:02.190
He's not just a kangaroo. He is also around the 10th.

322
00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.190
<v 1>Nothing less than a gun.</v>

323
00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.590
<v 0>You see during his reign,</v>

324
00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.830
the previous King Rehmann the ninth had earned the respect of the Thai people

325
00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.690
and in such a conservative society, ramen,

326
00:18:14.691 --> 00:18:16.850
the ninth represented righteousness and discipline.

327
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:19.640
His son is just the opposite. He's been divorced.

328
00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:23.840
Three times has four illegitimate children and has appointed his dog as

329
00:18:23.841 --> 00:18:26.830
commander of the air force. If all of this were not enough King Rama,

330
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:30.470
the 10th does not even live in Thailand. In 2016,

331
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.030
he bought a mansion in Bavaria,

332
00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:34.850
in Southern Germany and wants to reel Thailand from there. Yeah.

333
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:42.740
In fact, this is one of his conditions for approving the 2017 constitution.

334
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.610
They had to let him reign from Germany. And I know what you're thinking now.

335
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:50.930
What if this can simply doesn't want to reign? I mean, that could be the case.

336
00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.180
He wants to get away from politics. I love his own life,

337
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.540
but the reality is quite the opposite.

338
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:01.970
<v 1>Two weeks ago,</v>

339
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:06.020
the Thai King issued a Royal decree placing two army units under his direct

340
00:19:06.021 --> 00:19:10.310
control rather than under the normal military hierarchy world politics review.

341
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.630
<v 0>That's right,</v>

342
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.900
rather than the 10th is taking steps to restore the absolute monarchy in

343
00:19:14.901 --> 00:19:18.770
Thailand. He's gaining more and more control over the army.

344
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.640
And the 2019 elections. He banned his sister from running from prime minister.

345
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.210
And that's not the worst thing you see until 2017,

346
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.720
the assets of the Thai Royal house were managed by the Chrome property Bureau

347
00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.770
and institution controlled by the ministry.

348
00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:33.283
<v 1>Finance.</v>

349
00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:36.890
<v 0>To give you an idea,</v>

350
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:40.700
these assets comprise something like a sovereign fund with investments and local

351
00:19:40.701 --> 00:19:41.810
companies. For example,

352
00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.140
the tie Royals are the main shareholders of one of the largest banks in the

353
00:19:45.141 --> 00:19:47.210
country, the Siam commercial bank. Well,

354
00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.420
the first thing that rounded the tempted as soon as he came to ruin was to take

355
00:19:50.421 --> 00:19:51.980
full control of this office.

356
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:56.750
It is estimated that the institution controls $40 billion that are now solely in

357
00:19:56.751 --> 00:20:00.530
the hands of the King. And it doesn't end there. In addition to that,

358
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.590
his salary has been raised for 2021.

359
00:20:03.591 --> 00:20:07.730
The Royal Thai house will receive more than $1.1 billion from the government and

360
00:20:07.731 --> 00:20:11.180
all this for ruling from his mentioned in Germany.

361
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.380
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

362
00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:15.980
<v 0>Other words,</v>

363
00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.430
Thailand has all the ingredients for a properly revolt economic malaise,

364
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:22.490
a corrupt elite that has lost the trust of the majority of assistants and the

365
00:20:22.491 --> 00:20:23.480
leader Mr.

366
00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:26.210
<v 1>[Inaudible] capable.</v>

367
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.250
<v 0>Of bringing together all of this discontent.</v>

368
00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:32.720
And what might you wonder are these protestors asking for their main demands are

369
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:35.270
to put an end to crimes against the Royal leader to force the crime,

370
00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:39.050
to be transparent with its assets and to prohibit the King from instigating QD

371
00:20:39.051 --> 00:20:42.200
times, these might seem like very moderate claims,

372
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:45.200
but remember that we are talking about what is perhaps the most monarchial

373
00:20:45.201 --> 00:20:46.220
country in the world.

374
00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.930
And that's why it's so incredible that it's only now that we're starting to hear

375
00:20:49.931 --> 00:20:50.764
things.

376
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:55.050
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

377
00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:58.800
<v 2>Call for end of monarchy on King's birthday, Deutsche Avaya.</v>

378
00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:02.070
<v 0>Right? But we are not talking about just one or two protests.</v>

379
00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.950
The demonstrations in Thailand began in February,

380
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:08.010
2020 and the King's birthday was the end of July in July 20,

381
00:21:08.011 --> 00:21:12.120
20 many more people started to take to the streets and squares and universities

382
00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:14.550
there have been protests and all of the main cities.

383
00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.650
So far there have been no deaths,

384
00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.950
but there have been several attempts by the army and the police to suppress the

385
00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:20.933
person.

386
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:24.660
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

387
00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.590
<v 0>The demonstrators continued to protest. So now the question is over to you.</v>

388
00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:31.530
Do you think that these protests will create real change in Thailand?

389
00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.380
What do you think of the time monarchy and of monarchies in general?

390
00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:37.980
Do you think it's an outdated institution or perhaps one that still has a place

391
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.880
in our tank and will I ever get to go to Thailand,
