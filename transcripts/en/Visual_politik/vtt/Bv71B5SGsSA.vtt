00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.650
<v 0>Pay close attention to this data.</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.180
13.5 million cases and about 600,000 deaths worldwide.

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.350
While in Europe and Asia,

4
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.770
the SARS cov two pandemic is already more or less under control.

5
00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:14.310
The virus continues to spread around the world at breakneck speed in Latin

6
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:16.530
America. For example, while preparing this video,

7
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:20.400
the pandemic had not yet reached its peak and already it is producing some

8
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:23.520
massive social and economic havoc. Brazil. For example,

9
00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:27.690
forecasts are fall of between 6.4 and 9% of its GDP in

10
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.680
2024. That if things don't start improving could get even worse,

11
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.990
but of course the worst factor is no longer the economy,

12
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.050
but the number of victims it is leaving in Latin America,

13
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.650
Give you an idea around 3.5 million cases,

14
00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:47.120
and more than 150,000 deaths have been confirmed in this region. So far,

15
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.370
this accounts for around a quarter of all cases,

16
00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:51.920
worldwide and 20% of all fatalities.

17
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.250
And if we include the figures from the United States with more than 3 million,

18
00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:57.290
450,000 cases,

19
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.130
the truth is that the American continent already accounts for more than half of

20
00:01:01.131 --> 00:01:02.720
all of the cases in the world,

21
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.380
despite having just over 13% of the world's population.

22
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.660
<v 1>In.</v>

23
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.080
<v 0>Fact,</v>

24
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.320
if we want to talk about a country that is experiencing the worst of this trend,

25
00:01:12.321 --> 00:01:14.600
clearly it is the USA. Look at this chart

26
00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.750
Far from controlling the situation.

27
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.770
The United States is experiencing a brutal upturn in the first wave,

28
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.860
an upturn that continues to break new records. For example,

29
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.490
more than 71,000 infections occurred on July 10th.

30
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.820
That's 71,000 infections in one single day

31
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.630
Friends in the land of uncle Sam, a curious phenomenon is taking place.

32
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.620
The pandemic is moving at two different speeds in States that first suffered the

33
00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:49.460
onslaught such as New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Connecticut.

34
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.670
The first wave seems to now be under control and stable.

35
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.330
It's a scenario that's very similar to what is happening in Europe. However,

36
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.910
in States where it was fairly well controlled at first,

37
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.640
but where restrictions were generally relaxed much earlier,

38
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.570
they are now experiencing wild increases in case numbers and deaths.

39
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.860
We're talking about States like Arizona, Florida, Texas, or even California.

40
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.430
I mean, it's not possible to talk about a second wave yet.

41
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.030
Although in some other countries where they suffered the first early blows of

42
00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:20.960
the Corona virus,

43
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.500
they are already talking about the possibility of a resurgence take.

44
00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:26.810
For example, the case of South Korea,

45
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.910
South Korea says it is battling a second wave of Corona virus routers now,

46
00:02:31.911 --> 00:02:35.840
considering what is happening in America and comparing it to the apparent calm

47
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.640
that Europe seems to be experiencing.

48
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.560
And given the concern that is coming from Asia,

49
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.220
could we say that we are on the threshold of a second global wave of SARS,

50
00:02:43.221 --> 00:02:47.030
cov two crude it be beginning to manifest itself earlier in some parts of the

51
00:02:47.031 --> 00:02:49.760
world than in others and the most important question of all,

52
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.480
what would this scenario really entailed? Can we avoid it? Well, listen up.

53
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.763
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

54
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.120
<v 0>Friends. Before I start, I'm going to ask you a question.</v>

55
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.880
Have you ever wondered what the definition of a second way.

56
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.953
<v 1>Dave really is?</v>

57
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.910
Yes.

58
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.250
<v 0>Okay. I'm sure we all have some sort of idea,</v>

59
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.980
but what exactly is it while it seems like an easy question?

60
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.940
The truth is that there is not even any consensus among experts.

61
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.930
A common belief is that the second wave will occur when a very significant and

62
00:03:27.931 --> 00:03:32.190
sustained increase in coronavirus cases is recorded over time and increase that

63
00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:36.360
occurs after a relatively long period in which the transmission rate is zero or

64
00:03:36.361 --> 00:03:37.320
at least very low.

65
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.890
That is why strictly in the case of countries like the United States,

66
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.370
we cannot say that there is a second wave since the minimum number of cases

67
00:03:44.371 --> 00:03:48.510
recorded after the first peak was just over 18,000 in a single day.

68
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.100
In other words, in the United States,

69
00:03:50.101 --> 00:03:53.670
they simply have not yet managed to control the effects of the first wave.

70
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.300
And that alone should make the authorities by federal and state ask themselves

71
00:03:57.301 --> 00:03:58.020
some questions.

72
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.710
And of course some constructive criticism would not be a bad thing right now.

73
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.520
How is it possible that the world's greatest power is the country that is having

74
00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:08.250
the most trouble in controlling this pandemic? Well,

75
00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:11.580
at least it looks like Trump's campaign against mosques is already history.

76
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.120
The point is that today virtually no country seems to fit the definition of a

77
00:04:15.121 --> 00:04:17.580
second wave, at least for now. But wait a moment.

78
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.270
Why are we talking so much about and giving such great importance to the second?

79
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.920
Wait, why is it so scary? Well,

80
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.980
the main reason is the comparison to the 1918 flu.

81
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.850
A flu that in many ways looks a lot like the current coronavirus pandemic

82
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.350
This earlier flu the H one N one influenza that became a pandemic entered the

83
00:04:37.351 --> 00:04:39.090
lives of 50 million people.

84
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.290
And according to data from confirmed cases infected more than 500 million.

85
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.070
This main similarity is that like SARS cov two, it was a new virus,

86
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.150
highly contagious by the respiratory route and completely unknown to the human

87
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.680
organism that is people had no defenses to reject the infection this as with the

88
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.500
coronavirus caused it to spread rapidly around the world.

89
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.220
And consequently fatality rates were very high. Its main peculiarity.

90
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.940
The second wave was much more deadly and infected many more people than the

91
00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:06.540
first.

92
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.750
And it's that particular fact that makes the fear of the second wave of the

93
00:05:09.751 --> 00:05:14.130
Corona virus. So strong, will it have the same consequences as in 1918?

94
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.500
<v 1>And.</v>

95
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.070
<v 0>The bad news is that the world's leading experts almost assumed that the second</v>

96
00:05:20.071 --> 00:05:22.290
wave will be a reality. Take a look.

97
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.960
<v 2>A second wave is almost inevitable,</v>

98
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.120
particularly as we go towards the winter months,

99
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.810
the challenge for government is to ensure that the peak isn't so great that it

100
00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:32.370
overburdens the health care system.

101
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.970
Professor Jonathan bowl biologist at the university of Nottingham.

102
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.440
In my mind,

103
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.620
it's inevitable that we will have a return of the virus when it does,

104
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.010
how we handle it will determine our fate, Dr. Anthony Fowchee,

105
00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.610
director of the national Institute of allergy and infectious diseases of the

106
00:05:47.611 --> 00:05:48.540
United States.

107
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.290
<v 0>The big question is how will this new attack of the Corona virus be?</v>

108
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.840
Will it be wild and lethal like the 1918 flu?

109
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.580
Or could it be something very different?

110
00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.780
Could that terrible scenario be avoided? Well, let's take a look.

111
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.730
<v 2>Uh, second wave eminent.</v>

112
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.650
<v 0>Attention to the international press.</v>

113
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.470
It seems that a second wave would go something like this.

114
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.600
<v 2>W H O official warns of a second deadly wave of the Corona virus across Europe</v>

115
00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.100
and the fall. Now as the time for preparation, not celebration business insider,

116
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.990
second more deadly wave of Corona virus expected to hit Europe this winter,

117
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.750
the Telegraph Europe's top world health organization,

118
00:06:31.751 --> 00:06:35.620
official warns that our second spike could coincide with outbreaks of other

119
00:06:35.621 --> 00:06:36.760
infectious diseases.

120
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.800
<v 0>Facts that in the face of such alarm,</v>

121
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.110
I think there is something that we should ask ourselves.

122
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:42.880
Is there really any grounds to think of that?

123
00:06:42.881 --> 00:06:46.060
A second wave will be so terrible and lethal? Well, on this subject,

124
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.030
there are all types of arguments, both good and bad reasons,

125
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.880
but let's start with the bad ones. The question of immunity

126
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.540
And concern for a second wave is that even though Corona virus has turned the

127
00:06:58.541 --> 00:07:02.260
world upside down in practice, very few people have overcome the infection.

128
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.160
The vast majority of the world's population remains as exposed and helpless to

129
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.520
coronavirus as they were before. It was discovered. For example,

130
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.340
in the case of Spain, the government sero prevalence study,

131
00:07:12.341 --> 00:07:17.080
estimated that only 5.2% of the population have recovered from the infection and

132
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.410
check this out for data from other countries that have been greatly affected.

133
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.890
The numbers have been similar. The Netherlands has around 3% France,

134
00:07:23.891 --> 00:07:27.880
just under 5% and Sweden 6.1%, but the bad news doesn't end there.

135
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.870
Even those few people who have been infected and have antibodies might not be as

136
00:07:31.871 --> 00:07:34.540
protective as we might think if a second wave were to.

137
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.950
<v 1>In autumn or winter,</v>

138
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.470
the problem antibodies may not remain in the body for long enough.

139
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.450
<v 2>Corona virus antibodies may last only two to three months after infection study</v>

140
00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:53.980
suggests CNBC. When you look at the history of Corona viruses,

141
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.560
the common Corona viruses that cause the common cold,

142
00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:00.130
the reports and the literature are that the durability of immunity that's

143
00:08:00.131 --> 00:08:04.360
protective ranges from three to six months to almost always less than a year.

144
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:05.230
Anthony Fowchee.

145
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:06.340
<v 0>In other words,</v>

146
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:11.050
herd immunity where the pandemic disappears if between 60 and 80% of people have

147
00:08:11.051 --> 00:08:13.930
been exposed to and to recover from the virus might not be an option.

148
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.130
So faced with this reality,

149
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:19.810
the question is what can we and the United States do to avoid this dreaded mass

150
00:08:19.811 --> 00:08:22.960
second wave? Well, the truth is that there is no magic bullet here.

151
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.930
We need to do what we already know until a vaccine is available.

152
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:29.260
All we have left is prevention protection and mass testing.

153
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.950
But in saying that we do have reasons for optimism because the truth is that the

154
00:08:32.951 --> 00:08:36.430
scenario we are facing now is very different from that between January and

155
00:08:36.431 --> 00:08:37.264
March,

156
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.850
I'll have special precautionary measures in terms of transport and in the

157
00:08:42.851 --> 00:08:44.470
arrival of international travelers,

158
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.520
we have closer control of suspected cases and a greater ability to conduct

159
00:08:48.521 --> 00:08:52.570
screening. We have learnt how to isolate positive cases and their contacts.

160
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.440
And in many countries,

161
00:08:53.441 --> 00:08:57.300
there is even a detailed tracing alert system for people who might have been

162
00:08:57.301 --> 00:09:00.150
infected by being close to the positive case. In addition,

163
00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:04.050
people are much more aware of and conscientious in the use of their masks.

164
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.220
And this is very important because even if only half of the population used them

165
00:09:08.221 --> 00:09:09.220
frequently, the spread of.

166
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:14.570
<v 1>Would be greatly reduced take notes.</v>

167
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.960
<v 0>Because this simple habit wearing masks could really be what makes the</v>

168
00:09:17.961 --> 00:09:20.720
difference between a resurgence or keeping the virus at Bay.

169
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.100
Look at these images for a moment

170
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.690
without a mask respiratory droplets, when speaking,

171
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.980
breathing coughing or sneezing can spread from one to seven and a half meters in

172
00:09:30.981 --> 00:09:35.000
some cases, first being able to infect anyone in the near vicinity, however,

173
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.750
with a mask,

174
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.570
the droplets are trapped inside and do not disperse through the air.

175
00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.780
So if everyone wore a mask, even if it was a simple surgical mask,

176
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:44.720
then the Corona virus would barely have a chance to cause a second wave.

177
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.070
At least not a significant.

178
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.013
<v 1>The new wave.</v>

179
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.690
<v 0>For example, what happened recently on a plane, traveling from China to Toronto,</v>

180
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.320
one of the passengers turned out to be infected with Corona virus and had a dry

181
00:09:57.321 --> 00:09:58.940
cough throughout the flight. Well,

182
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:03.020
none of the 25 passengers sitting two meters around were infected because the

183
00:10:03.021 --> 00:10:04.850
man with the virus was wearing a mask.

184
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:11.030
Something like this also happened at a hairdressers in Springfield,

185
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:15.170
Missouri USA, two hairdressers turned out to be infected by SARS cov two,

186
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.400
but none of the 140 customers that they had contact with tested positive.

187
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.100
And yes, this was also because they had been wearing masks.

188
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.900
This is the conclusion.

189
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.260
According to research published in the prestigious scientific journal,

190
00:10:30.261 --> 00:10:30.950
the Lancet,

191
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:35.780
which gathers data from 172 studies from 16 different countries on the effect of

192
00:10:35.781 --> 00:10:40.160
masks, the risk of transmitting the virus is greatly reduced by mask use.

193
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:44.120
Trump may take note according to the study and infected person who in fact may

194
00:10:44.121 --> 00:10:49.010
be asymptomatic and therefore not know that they are infected as a 17.4%

195
00:10:49.011 --> 00:10:52.220
chance of infecting another person. If they do not wear a mask,

196
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.790
but whilst wearing one, the probability is reduced to 3.1%.

197
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.680
And if we combine social distancing,

198
00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.910
then the probability is further reduced to around 2%. So onto the big question,

199
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.570
can a second wave be completely avoided? The answer is unfortunately, no,

200
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.440
but if the question where can a second massive deadly wave be avoided,

201
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:13.940
then the answer would be yes, yes. If we all do our bit, so,

202
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.040
you know, please wear a mask. It's the least.

203
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:19.910
<v 1>So.</v>

204
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.310
<v 0>Point the question is, how might a second wave look,</v>

205
00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.330
if we all complied with hygienic standards and wore a mask? Well,

206
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:30.350
certainly something very different from the second wave of the 1918 flu.

207
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.213
Take a look at this.

208
00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:38.060
<v 1>A different future.</v>

209
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:42.890
<v 0>In the beginning of the video,</v>

210
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:46.130
South Korea declared the second wave of the virus in their country on the

211
00:11:46.131 --> 00:11:48.290
22nd of June, 2020. However,

212
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.870
if you look at the graph of the new daily cases in that country,

213
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:54.670
we see that in reality, it's rare that 50 cases a day are exceeded.

214
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.270
At least these were the data when preparing the video, but hold on a minute.

215
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:02.740
So why do they already consider a second wave when there are so few daily cases?

216
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:05.910
<v 1>Well.</v>

217
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.100
<v 0>This becomes clear when you compare their previous data.</v>

218
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.240
In the case of South Korea,

219
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:13.320
he had weeks with virtually zero cases and then suddenly more and more new

220
00:12:13.321 --> 00:12:16.530
outbreaks began to appear well, dear friends of visual politic,

221
00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.190
this is precisely how his second wave could manifest itself in countries like

222
00:12:20.191 --> 00:12:20.760
Korea,

223
00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.270
where virtually everyone wears a mask and where people are hyper aware of the

224
00:12:24.271 --> 00:12:28.530
risks posed by this virus. And look, this scenario is still a huge challenge,

225
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.480
a challenge for both health and to the economy,

226
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.960
which we will have to put up with at least until the much desired vaccine

227
00:12:33.961 --> 00:12:38.040
appears a second wave based on small, but numerous outbreaks would force such

228
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.690
Containing outbreaks would require selective quarantines,

229
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.810
such as the closure of entire apartment buildings, businesses,

230
00:12:48.811 --> 00:12:51.960
and even neighborhoods that may have to spend isolated periods with the

231
00:12:51.961 --> 00:12:55.710
corresponding stigma and fear that would arise in those circumstances.

232
00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:59.400
It would also take a very thorough system of tracking and tracing cases and

233
00:12:59.401 --> 00:13:03.510
possible contexts to quickly put infected individuals in isolation and thus

234
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.390
ensure that they do not continue to infect others. Of course,

235
00:13:06.391 --> 00:13:09.570
this scenario could also have a strong impact in terms of investment and

236
00:13:09.571 --> 00:13:13.230
business. I mean, the effect on the economy might take a long time to rectify,

237
00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.080
and that would mean that governments should already be taking steps to

238
00:13:16.081 --> 00:13:17.100
compensate for these damages.

239
00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:20.250
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

240
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.040
<v 0>This scenario would infinitely be better than the disaster that we've been</v>

241
00:13:23.041 --> 00:13:25.080
seeing since the beginning of the year. Therefore,

242
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:29.310
the number one goal has to be to avoid a second uncontrolled and large scale

243
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.880
wave And avoiding.

244
00:13:32.881 --> 00:13:35.520
It is something that is after rule in the hands of all of us.

245
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.610
And we'll come down to our responsibility in terms of hygiene,

246
00:13:38.611 --> 00:13:42.120
precautions in avoiding very crowded places. And of course,

247
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.490
as we have already described, wearing a mask,

248
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.880
because even if governments have the responsibility of protecting borders to

249
00:13:47.881 --> 00:13:51.870
prevent cases from entering from other more effected countries or of conducting

250
00:13:51.871 --> 00:13:54.450
many more tests to quickly detect these new outbreaks,

251
00:13:54.451 --> 00:13:58.260
the truth is that what happens day-to-day is largely dependent on all of us.

252
00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.930
So the big question is, will we be able to do it?

253
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.980
Will we be responsible enough to avoid a second mass wave by continuing to take

254
00:14:04.981 --> 00:14:07.310
preventative measures? Even when we think the worst is.

255
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:11.130
<v 1>Friends.</v>

256
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:12.360
<v 0>We have the technology,</v>

257
00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:16.050
we have the means and also the experience of the last few months,

258
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.620
but will we really be able to achieve it? Let's hope so, friends,

259
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:23.220
this is the scenario we're facing the risks and measures to try to slow.

260
00:14:23.221 --> 00:14:25.590
The virus are already well known to all of us.
