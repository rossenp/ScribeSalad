00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.283
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.100
<v 1>The South Korean film parasite made a clean sweep at the 2020. Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.970
First time in history, a non-English language film won the main award,

4
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.630
the Oscar for best film and addition to three other awards.

5
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.310
So if this were not visual politic,

6
00:00:28.311 --> 00:00:32.030
we may be mistaken for believing that South Korea is at the top of their game

7
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.520
lately. However, you know that here on visual politics,

8
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.290
we like to go a little bit deeper.

9
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.720
<v 0>And.</v>

10
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.690
<v 1>The truth is that the South Korean economy is going through a bit of a rough</v>

11
00:00:41.691 --> 00:00:45.680
patch both now. And even before the coronavirus pandemic in a positive video,

12
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.460
we told you how the South Korean model seems to be exhausted in today's video.

13
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.310
We're going to talk about another one of the big issues that have all the

14
00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:54.350
economists in the country on edge.

15
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.340
<v 0>You see my friend.</v>

16
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.720
<v 1>South Korea and especially Saul and its metropolitan area have a serious problem</v>

17
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.920
with their real estate markets. A problem that has been brewing for years,

18
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.600
we are talking about one of the hottest,

19
00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:11.600
most frenetic real estate markets in the world at the time.

20
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.410
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

21
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.561
<v 1>No,</v>

22
00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:18.650
because I'm not just referring to the hundreds and hundreds of cranes that have

23
00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:22.640
been erecting, new buildings all over the city for years. I'm also talking.

24
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.320
<v 0>The prices over the past.</v>

25
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.580
<v 1>Five years alone. Housing prices in Seoul have shot up by more than 20%.</v>

26
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.490
And that's on top of levels that were not exactly low to begin with.

27
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.040
Quite the country, meanwhile, or the same period.

28
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.350
Cumulative inflation has been around about six.

29
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.130
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

30
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.070
<v 1>In other words, house prices, which were already very high,</v>

31
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.580
have risen well above other prices. And that's when the problems start,

32
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.850
especially if we're talking about an economy that seems exhausted.

33
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.440
I can imagine this has made it very,

34
00:01:57.441 --> 00:01:59.690
very difficult for families and young people,

35
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.880
especially young people to start an industry.

36
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.253
<v 0>Light.</v>

37
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.040
<v 1>Skyrocketing and families need to get into astronomical debt just to get on.</v>

38
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.933
Yeah.

39
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.880
<v 0>Household debt grows much faster than anyone.</v>

40
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.990
<v 1>The Korea times. Well, the fact is that in the face of such a scenario,</v>

41
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.990
current president moon Jae-in has this idea to make this problem.

42
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.130
One of his political ones.

43
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.963
<v 0>Priorities.</v>

44
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.170
<v 1>During the election campaign that brought him to power.</v>

45
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.710
He promised to take all necessary measures to deflate the prices of the real

46
00:02:30.711 --> 00:02:34.670
estate sector and make housing affordable for young South Koreans. Now,

47
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.190
does this ring any bells for anyone? I'm sure it does.

48
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.100
It's a strategy that's trending with politicians all around, right?

49
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.140
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

50
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.040
<v 1>And three years after coming to power things,</v>

51
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.360
and South Korea are worse than ever. And yet, as we shall see,

52
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.100
this president has not been yet.

53
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.993
<v 0>Procrastinate.</v>

54
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.470
<v 1>What exactly are these measures?</v>

55
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.130
How has [inaudible] and attempted to housing affordable?

56
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.510
Are these measures working?

57
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.470
What can we learn from the changes he's made and how could this matter impact

58
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:07.840
the battered South Korean economy? When I find out.

59
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.993
<v 0>Let's get cracking</v>

60
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.580
the most inaccessible soul.

61
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.030
<v 1>The data is devastating. You see, I don't want to bombard you with the figures,</v>

62
00:03:24.031 --> 00:03:26.810
but there are a few that are key to understanding the scale of.

63
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.713
<v 0>The problem.</v>

64
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.950
<v 1>Four years ago,</v>

65
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.910
buying a home in school costs roughly 8.8 years of the average full salary.

66
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.460
When moon became president in May, 2017,

67
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.570
that figure had already risen to 11 years. And at the current time,

68
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.040
the estimate is more than 14.

69
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.850
<v 0>Teen years. [inaudible].</v>

70
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.820
<v 1>We're talking about a relatively small non luxury homes.</v>

71
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.450
That is an average apartment of about 60 meters squared and a regular

72
00:03:54.451 --> 00:03:56.880
neighborhood can cost almost half a million.

73
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.183
<v 0>Billion dollars.</v>

74
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.500
<v 1>In other words,</v>

75
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.740
the sole real estate market is almost as hot as the London market.

76
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.280
The difficulty in accessing housing in this setting today exceeds that of cities

77
00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:10.320
like Paris, Singapore, or new.

78
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.213
<v 0>New York.</v>

79
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.470
<v 1>Is not all added to this situation.</v>

80
00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:22.470
We have the slow down of the South Korean economy and the increasing

81
00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:24.090
deterioration and employment figures,

82
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.600
something that has only been further accentuated by the coronavirus crisis.

83
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.320
For example,

84
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.910
unemployment among the youngest citizens aged 15 to 29 is close to 10% and

85
00:04:32.911 --> 00:04:35.100
abnormally high level for this Asian country.

86
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.010
<v 0>Once.</v>

87
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.840
<v 1>Fierce Asian dragon has stopped roaring,</v>

88
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.430
and that has set off all the alarms on the one hand access to housing for young

89
00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:46.620
people is becoming almost a mission impossible.

90
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.440
And on the other doubts are beginning to grow as to whether or not the housing

91
00:04:49.441 --> 00:04:51.360
prices are sustainable. In other words,

92
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.790
could Seoul be facing a bubble that is about.

93
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.480
<v 0>To burst? Yeah.</v>

94
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.780
<v 1>We think that's a good question because you see my friend's moon and promise to</v>

95
00:05:00.781 --> 00:05:02.970
end the hosing problems. But since he came to power,

96
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.290
they only been getting worse.

97
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.663
<v 0>And worse.</v>

98
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.810
<v 1>Hold on. Just one moment.</v>

99
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.440
The current situation in the real estate market is not money and his fault ed

100
00:05:13.441 --> 00:05:15.330
has been brewing for a long time.

101
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.600
At least says a team of conservative presidents park when he,

102
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.170
who is removed from office due to a huge corruption scandal and no, well, no,

103
00:05:22.171 --> 00:05:23.100
she sleeps blank.

104
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.963
<v 0>The barns.</v>

105
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.660
<v 1>What did South Korean politicians do to cause housing prices in some areas of</v>

106
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.600
soul to rise faster than in cities like Hong Kong or Montreal?

107
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.250
<v 0>Well, let's take a look.</v>

108
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.600
The same old root of the problem. [inaudible].

109
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.493
<v 1>Visual quality goes.</v>

110
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.770
The problem with politics is that our representatives tends to worry about the

111
00:05:49.771 --> 00:05:51.480
short term about the next election,

112
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.660
and then not so much about what comes after that face it.

113
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:55.800
If you're a politician,

114
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.450
you have very little incentive to worry about what's going to happen in the

115
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:00.830
medium and long term.

116
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.830
That is why it is often the case that when they get their hands on institutions,

117
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:09.590
such as the central bank, things do not end well.

118
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.560
But that's exactly what happened in South Korea.

119
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.740
The combination of expansive monetary policies to encourage the grinding of

120
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:21.830
mortgages, along with the constant regulations of give and take,

121
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:22.371
and the countries,

122
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:25.280
property sector largely explained everything that has happened.

123
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.540
Mind you. I'm not the only one seeing this,

124
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.870
the former president she's telling us this, take a look at this.

125
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.420
<v 2>I will drastically boost the property market and loosen up unnecessary</v>

126
00:06:37.421 --> 00:06:40.570
regulations so that the economy can be revitalized.

127
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.590
Many measures adopted to prevent property market overheating turned out to be

128
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.010
obstacles after the market went down. These need to be loosened up a bit.

129
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.930
Ex president park, June. Yeah.

130
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.630
<v 1>Boy. Oh boy, did it all get loose?</v>

131
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.660
The real estate market and Sewell is on its way to becoming the second most

132
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.460
inaccessible market and the world after Hong Kong,

133
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.390
[inaudible] take notes because when the president's full of relaxing

134
00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:05.200
regulations,

135
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.470
she wasn't talking about rules that would limit the amount of construction or

136
00:07:08.471 --> 00:07:11.890
making projects more expensive, not by a long shot.

137
00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.420
It was basically about doping the economy by lowering interest rates and

138
00:07:16.421 --> 00:07:19.120
boosting credit as if there was no tomorrow.

139
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.320
For example, as you can see,

140
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.190
there was a huge reduction in interest rates without any crisis to justify it.

141
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.520
The essential objective of the government was as the former president herself

142
00:07:33.521 --> 00:07:37.420
acknowledges to feed the real estate sector with more and more credit.

143
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.750
And this way more jobs would be created. Prices and salaries would go up.

144
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.330
South Koreans would see their wealth grew and grew.

145
00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:49.750
Interest rates would go down and young people would have all the mortgages they

146
00:07:49.751 --> 00:07:54.490
needed to buy the houses they wanted and Sue everyone would be happy.

147
00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.260
And it went even further than that.

148
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.890
Low rates encourage savers to invest their money beyond a typical bank deposits

149
00:08:02.891 --> 00:08:03.820
to get some return

150
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.400
and where to families invest their money in periods when house prices are

151
00:08:09.401 --> 00:08:14.170
rising, exactly the invest in more houses, which feeds the whole process.

152
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.740
Even more, more demand, higher asset prices, more real estate development,

153
00:08:17.741 --> 00:08:21.580
more jobs, higher salaries. And let's keep this party going

154
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.800
because everything sounds good, right? But then the problem,

155
00:08:26.801 --> 00:08:30.040
my friends is that this is precisely how bubbles are formed,

156
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.050
especially real estate bubbles.

157
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:39.070
Then there comes a point when prices are so high and families are so in debt

158
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.350
that this whole process stalls,

159
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:45.220
and then suddenly the bubble bursts until that bubble burst.

160
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:48.730
The final years of this bull race become especially hard for people who want to

161
00:08:48.731 --> 00:08:52.480
buy the prices are so high and have increased so dramatically.

162
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.100
The Dustin's between house prices and salaries become astronomical.

163
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.800
And the effort to pay the mortgage is almost tight time.

164
00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:01.880
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

165
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.590
<v 1>And he knew exactly what she was doing.</v>

166
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.800
Doping the South Korean economy to fulfill her short term promise that the

167
00:09:06.801 --> 00:09:11.600
economy would grow by more than 3% a year. The problems would come later,

168
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.600
but that, that would be someone else's problem who cares

169
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.540
Brings us squarely to a key question.

170
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:23.930
How can such a colossal mess be fixed?

171
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.630
And I'm sure you don't need me to tell you that is a tough one.

172
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:27.523
<v 0>A Saint.</v>

173
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:33.080
<v 1>Let's take a look at muni N's plan to prevent the bubble from bursting all the</v>

174
00:09:33.081 --> 00:09:37.250
while making homes more affordable. Does he have the magic formula? Wow.

175
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:47.060
<v 0>Fighting intervention with more intervention.</v>

176
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.810
<v 1>My friends slowing down this process.</v>

177
00:09:50.811 --> 00:09:54.710
Once it picks up speeds can be as complicated as trying to stop a runaway train.

178
00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:57.200
And yes, yes. Some of you might be thinking, well,

179
00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:01.790
let's just raise the interest rates and that's it, right? Well, no,

180
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.270
it's not that simple. And it is certainly not the best strategy.

181
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.840
If you happen to be a politician who wants to keep your popularity rating up,

182
00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.590
or you're thinking about the reelection of your party,

183
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.290
Raising interest rates are slowing down the granting of credit with simply mean

184
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.280
that many people would not be able to pay their mortgage or get one in the first

185
00:10:22.281 --> 00:10:25.280
place. Not only that as financing becomes more expensive,

186
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:28.640
the demand for houses would fall. And this would also cause prices to fall.

187
00:10:28.641 --> 00:10:32.180
And many properties developers would suddenly find their very existence in

188
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:36.380
danger. Of course,

189
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.410
all of this would affect more than just real estate companies.

190
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.500
The higher cost of financing and the Lords of money would leave many companies

191
00:10:42.501 --> 00:10:44.120
of all kinds to bankruptcy.

192
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:48.560
So dozens of jobs would be lost suddenly defaults and Lundy volts with multiply

193
00:10:48.561 --> 00:10:52.100
like weeds. The banking system would start to wobble, et cetera, et cetera,

194
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.880
et cetera.

195
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.000
The outcome of all this should sound very familiar to you because it's what

196
00:10:56.001 --> 00:10:58.040
happens to us all in 2008,

197
00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.240
Most likely the bubble will burst right in front of our faces.

198
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.920
Once you open up Pandora's box,

199
00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:11.780
closing it as not so easy playing with the central bank can turn into your worst

200
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:16.070
nightmare. However size Korea is not yet quite in that situation.

201
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:17.900
And the question we can ask ourselves is,

202
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.190
so what does muni and want to do to avoid the nightmare? Well,

203
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.850
their plan was put into action on the 13th of September, 2018.

204
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:34.280
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

205
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:37.370
<v 1>He presented a very ambitious package of measures measures that basically</v>

206
00:11:37.371 --> 00:11:39.590
consisted of more regulation. In other words,

207
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.330
trying to stop the price escalation by using the line

208
00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:45.830
This week,

209
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.760
the government described a number of areas in the country as speculative areas,

210
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:50.750
or in other words,

211
00:11:50.751 --> 00:11:54.820
areas with high demand and lots of real estate transactions in these areas,

212
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.180
most of which are located in soon, numerous restrictions have been put in place.

213
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.660
The most important of these are the prohibition of granting a mortgage to those

214
00:12:01.661 --> 00:12:03.250
who already own several homes,

215
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:06.850
restricting mortgages for luxury homes that are not intended to be lifted.

216
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.320
And the establishment of a limit of 40% of the property price to the financing

217
00:12:11.321 --> 00:12:14.890
that banks can grant to companies that buy houses and then rent them out

218
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:21.070
and this way, Mooney and seeks to limit access to credit to certain agents,

219
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.870
such as multiple owners and other words at once to artificially reduce demand in

220
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.750
order to curb the price increase. In addition to these measures,

221
00:12:28.751 --> 00:12:32.020
the government also announced a public housing program to increase the supply of

222
00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:34.480
real estate at pre appraised prices, listen up.

223
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:38.850
<v 2>The government to supply 300,000 public homes through 2021.</v>

224
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:43.080
The government will complete the purchase of four or five idle sites in Seoul,

225
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:47.070
in Shan and [inaudible] province plans to build four to five new,

226
00:12:47.071 --> 00:12:51.660
small residential towns between Seoul and the existing large residential

227
00:12:51.661 --> 00:12:54.600
areas of Elston and boondock the Korea times.

228
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:56.880
<v 1>Well wait, because there's more recently,</v>

229
00:12:56.881 --> 00:13:00.000
this housing program had been extended and both the government and several

230
00:13:00.001 --> 00:13:04.860
public companies have made the land available to build 132,000 new homes.

231
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.753
At the same time,

232
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.390
the maximum hate of the apartment blocks has been increased from 35 to 50

233
00:13:09.391 --> 00:13:10.740
floors. And not only that,

234
00:13:10.741 --> 00:13:14.490
but an urban rehabilitation program will be created to speed up the process of

235
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.200
tearing down older, lower rise,

236
00:13:16.201 --> 00:13:20.640
apartment developments and building new higher and more efficient ones.

237
00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:24.660
So basically it's a full-blown re densification project. And the end,

238
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.480
all these recent measures are setting Korea on a different path,

239
00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:31.170
increasing supply rather than focusing on artificially restricting the month.

240
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.470
In fact, as you can see, despite the measures taken in that direction,

241
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.040
prices have continued to rise at roughly the same rate as moon's popularity,

242
00:13:38.041 --> 00:13:39.930
as president has plummeted.

243
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:44.550
<v 2>Moon's approval rating plummets as house prices keeps soaring Nika.</v>

244
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:49.380
<v 1>And it's kind of no wonder South Korea is facing a very complex scenario.</v>

245
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:59.340
One hunt its economic growth has slowed down a lot. In fact, in 2020,

246
00:13:59.341 --> 00:14:02.700
a slight recession is expected due to the Corona virus. On the other hand,

247
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.320
the housing bubble has not been stopped,

248
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:07.500
partly because the government has not only not reversed the expansive monetary

249
00:14:07.501 --> 00:14:11.130
policy, but has fed it even more and an attempt to curb the economic solution

250
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.670
[inaudible] ends policies have undermined the country's long history of

251
00:14:17.671 --> 00:14:21.120
competitiveness. This is something we talk about in this video and friends.

252
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.100
We could be looking at the perfect story

253
00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:28.650
And keep in mind,

254
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:32.100
but this is not the first time this country has been in a similar situation.

255
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.860
It also happens during the late eighties and the early nineties.

256
00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.150
Something that by the way,

257
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.780
ended with the country being the worst hit by the Asian financial crisis of

258
00:14:39.781 --> 00:14:43.500
1997. So at this point, the questions we are left with are as follows.

259
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:47.130
How can South Korea escape from this situation is more regulation of the keys to

260
00:14:47.131 --> 00:14:50.490
curbing the real estate crisis could South Korea be on the verge of a large

261
00:14:50.491 --> 00:14:53.900
bubble bursting under the auspices of constant monetary interventions and

262
00:14:53.901 --> 00:14:57.560
removable regulations. There are many, many questions as always.

263
00:14:57.561 --> 00:15:00.200
We have visual politics. We'll be keeping an eye on what happens,

264
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:01.640
but now it's down to you.

265
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:04.490
Do you think it's justified for governments to intervene in the market?

266
00:15:04.491 --> 00:15:07.580
Every time they feel the prices have risen to high, as always,

267
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:10.340
we ask the questions and we let you provide the answers.

268
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.800
Thanks for watching the video and as always, I'll see you next time.

269
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:20.920
