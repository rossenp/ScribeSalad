1
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.420
<v 1>Let's be honest. This is not the best year to say Merry Christmas.</v>

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.470
Many of you will have empty chairs of the table this year.

3
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.950
Others like me couldn't even make it home for the holidays.

4
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.290
And every one of us in one way or another,

5
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.890
we'll celebrate a better sweet end to 2020.

6
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.990
But despite all of this,

7
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.500
this is still Christmas attain to faint optimism,

8
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.180
even when it seems impossible. And this is why no matter what this year,

9
00:00:32.181 --> 00:00:36.170
we want to offer you some good news as a Christmas treat,

10
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.250
let's get started.

11
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.000
<v 2>It's midnight on 4th of November, 2020,</v>

12
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.820
just a few hours after voting closed on the elections,

13
00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.850
that would ultimately cost him the oval office. Us president,

14
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.420
Donald Trump managed to see one of his great commitments fulfilled the

15
00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:06.290
withdrawal of the United States from the so-called Paris agreement.

16
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.340
The American power fastest associated itself from one of the most important

17
00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:14.000
global agreements ever reached to give you an idea at the time of making this

18
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:14.390
video,

19
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.310
196 countries had signed this agreement and 188 more had ratified

20
00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:20.270
it throughout the world.

21
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.740
The Paris agreement was first adopted at the Paris climate conference cop 21 on

22
00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:29.300
12th of December, 2015.

23
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.890
In this agreement,

24
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.040
the signatory countries essentially committed themselves to reducing their

25
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:38.990
greenhouse gas emissions. But take note,

26
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.820
because this was the great novelty they did.

27
00:01:40.821 --> 00:01:44.540
So by accepting the duty of having to present concrete plans on how they

28
00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:47.960
intended to comply with their negotiated objectives, not only that,

29
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.620
but the obligation for all member countries to report periodically on their

30
00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:55.460
emissions and efforts to carry out their plans was also incorporated into the

31
00:01:55.461 --> 00:01:56.690
agreement. In other words,

32
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.350
the Paris agreement sorts to go far beyond a mere declaration of India,

33
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.280
But now United States,

34
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.180
the second most polluting country after China has decided to abandon the

35
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:11.780
agreement,

36
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.440
although it will be somewhat temporary because Joe Biden has already stated his

37
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:16.160
intention to return.

38
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.993
<v 0>Join us.</v>

39
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.470
<v 2>The thing is that this tubing and fro-ing has made us here at visual politic,</v>

40
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.950
ask ourselves a few questions. What does this agreement entail?

41
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.210
Or rather what hope is there that its goals will actually be met to answer these

42
00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:32.661
questions.

43
00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:36.710
We have decided to take a look at how things stand in the activity that accounts

44
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.970
through around three quarters. That's almost 75% of all CO2 emissions.

45
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.330
I'm talking about power generation, but what other sources of energy,

46
00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:48.530
electricity, heat, and combustion on which the whole world economy is based.

47
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.200
How have these sources changed over the last few years?

48
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.860
How is energy changing and why what's could the departure of the United States

49
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:57.110
from the Paris agreement mean for the rest of the world?

50
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.310
Difference in this video,

51
00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:02.110
we're going to see how many of the preconceived ideas we will have are in one

52
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:03.400
way or another wrong.

53
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.760
I think many of you are going to be quite surprised by a lot of the things we're

54
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:07.690
going to tell you today.

55
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.750
Are you ready to look inside the great engine of the world and see how it's

56
00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:12.280
changing? Well, let's get started.

57
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.370
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

58
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.330
<v 2>Energy consumption has three main forms, electricity, transportation,</v>

59
00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:31.740
and heat generation together.

60
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.980
They account for almost three quarters of all carbon dioxide.

61
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.550
<v 0>Michigan's because.</v>

62
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.290
<v 2>Is that today, the engine that keeps the world moving runs on dirty energy,</v>

63
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.160
fossil fuels,

64
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.780
coal oil and gas accounts for 79% of our global energy production.

65
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.650
So far, I doubt that any of this is surprising to any of you. However,

66
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.790
hold on a moment,

67
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.780
because during the last few years there have been two very pronounced trends on

68
00:03:57.781 --> 00:04:01.800
the one hand, although its consumption increased slightly in absolute terms,

69
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.340
the importance of coal in the world's energy supply has decreased over the last

70
00:04:05.341 --> 00:04:09.240
decade. A decade that began with very high expectations for this fuel.

71
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.020
You see the decades that began in the year 2000 saw the greatest growth in

72
00:04:13.021 --> 00:04:14.640
demand for coal in history.

73
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.510
The economic takeoff of China whose energy network is mainly fed by coal.

74
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.200
The Asian giant is responsible for almost half of all the world's coal

75
00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:24.840
production meant that during those 10 years,

76
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.740
the demand for this fuel grew more than during the previous four decades

77
00:04:28.741 --> 00:04:30.750
combined at the beginning of this century,

78
00:04:30.751 --> 00:04:34.650
everything pointed to the fact that China's unstoppable economic growth together

79
00:04:34.651 --> 00:04:36.210
with the budding takeoff of India.

80
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.810
Another country addicted to coal would also boost coal consumption over the

81
00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:43.860
following decade. However, this did not happen between 2010 and 2019.

82
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.580
The trend for coal demand was not positive. And in fact, in 2019,

83
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.730
the demand for coal was lower than it had been in 2013.

84
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.510
The growing environmental concerns represented by the Paris agreement itself.

85
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.060
Along with the natural gas revolution in the United States,

86
00:04:57.061 --> 00:04:58.770
brought on as a consequence of fracking,

87
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.220
which released huge amounts of natural gas and caused prices to plummet sank.

88
00:05:02.221 --> 00:05:04.310
The us giants called consumption by 40%.

89
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.830
This by the way was excellent news.

90
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.450
The decrease in the use of coal explained 75% of the reduction in CO2 emissions

91
00:05:15.451 --> 00:05:19.890
that the United States registered between 2005 and 2017. And then in Europe,

92
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.090
something similar happened,

93
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.470
Environmental awareness, lover, gas prices, new liquified,

94
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.410
natural gas capabilities and the new emissions trading scheme.

95
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.380
Pause the share of coal in power generation to sink by 50%.

96
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.450
Wait a minute because the emergence of gas was by no means the only reason for

97
00:05:45.451 --> 00:05:49.260
the drop in the use of coal. What is certain is that during the last decade,

98
00:05:49.261 --> 00:05:52.920
we have witnessed the beginning of a whole revolution that over renewable

99
00:05:52.921 --> 00:05:56.400
energies, particularly wind and solar energy. Do you want an example?

100
00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.100
The global of photo-voltaic solar energy has increased almost 20

101
00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:02.510
times during the last decade.

102
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.720
We are talking about the shift that not even the Corona virus has managed to

103
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:10.300
stop Facts,

104
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.143
to give you an idea.

105
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:15.520
The international energy agency estimates that by the end of 2020 world energy

106
00:06:15.521 --> 00:06:20.260
demand will have been reduced by 5% and investment by almost 20%. However,

107
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.900
despite its this investment in renewables has grown,

108
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.390
it is estimated that by 2020 alone,

109
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:30.370
198 gigawatts of renewable capacity will have been installed and almost 90%

110
00:06:30.371 --> 00:06:34.780
increase in the entire global energy capacity. Yep. That's what I said 19%.

111
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.640
For example, if we look at electricity,

112
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.660
renewable sources already account for 27% of all production globally.

113
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.410
That's not all the international energy agency expects that in the next five

114
00:06:44.411 --> 00:06:49.060
years alone, electricity production from renewable energy grow by another 50% to

115
00:06:49.061 --> 00:06:51.850
9,745 terawatt hours.

116
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.870
The equivalent of the combined current demand of China and the entire European

117
00:06:55.871 --> 00:06:56.290
union.

118
00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:00.100
This is an expectation that is consistent with the trends of recent years.

119
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.493
<v 0>Friends.</v>

120
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.540
<v 2>Some simply amazing numbers.</v>

121
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:15.160
The international energy agencies forecast is that renewables will cover 99%.

122
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.120
Yes, that's right.

123
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:20.550
99% of the entire increase in global electricity demand over the period,

124
00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.310
2020 to 2025. And this is no pie in the sky.

125
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.090
Either most projects are already planned or are in the research phase.

126
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.390
You don't have to dig too deep to see that many energy multinationals have

127
00:07:31.391 --> 00:07:34.630
announced investments of tens and tens of billions in renewable.

128
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:45.880
<v 0>Simply.</v>

129
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.870
<v 2>We are facing a historic change and it's not just about electricity generation</v>

130
00:07:49.871 --> 00:07:53.620
today. The importance of renewable energies is also going to grow stronger.

131
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.280
And the other two energy uses heat generation. And of course, transport,

132
00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.600
surely you have all seen news. Yeah.

133
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.033
<v 0>Yes.</v>

134
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:16.300
<v 2>Having come this far, I am sure, absolutely sure that there is a question.</v>

135
00:08:16.301 --> 00:08:19.780
Many of you are asking yourselves. I am certainly asking myself this question.

136
00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:23.380
What on earth could explain this almost disruptive change that has begun to take

137
00:08:23.381 --> 00:08:27.130
place over the last few years? Why are renewables growing so strongly?

138
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.850
And the ideas well, listen up because the answer may surprise. Many of them.

139
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:43.750
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

140
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:44.890
<v 2>Tom, renewable energies.</v>

141
00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:48.700
Why are so many multinationals concentrating their investments in this sector?

142
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.210
Is it just a matter of following the guidelines set by politicians or agreements

143
00:08:52.211 --> 00:08:55.060
like the one in Paris? Or is there something else? Isn't it strange?

144
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.300
Even countries like China have joined this kind of.

145
00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:58.603
<v 0>Trent.</v>

146
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.280
<v 2>Yes. Okay. Environmental awareness, social concern, responsibility,</v>

147
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:08.930
all of that friends is all well and good,

148
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.220
but let's not fool ourselves in order to carry out a change, a transition,

149
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:16.880
a revolution that means transforming the entire model of world energy

150
00:09:16.881 --> 00:09:20.660
production. Something else is needed. Energy needs to be competitive,

151
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.320
the cost and the profit and loss account all need to balance that.

152
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.000
<v 0>Watch.</v>

153
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.010
<v 2>May surprise you, but that's exactly what's happening.</v>

154
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.730
What we are going to show you next is not a green argument or anything like

155
00:09:34.731 --> 00:09:36.830
that. This is visual politic.

156
00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.170
What we're going to show you is nothing but the numbers,

157
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.830
the raw reality of the data friends over the last decade.

158
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.610
If we look at both the construction of production plants, for example,

159
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.930
a natural gas combined cycle power plant, or a wind farm,

160
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.080
and at the use fuel and operations themselves.

161
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.540
What we find is that the costs of renewable energy.

162
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:57.643
<v 0>Plummeted.</v>

163
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.490
<v 2>These are the facts to take away.</v>

164
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:05.900
The cost of onshore wind energy has fallen by 70% and the cost of solar energy

165
00:10:05.901 --> 00:10:10.220
by almost 90%. And that's without counting subsidies of any kind today.

166
00:10:10.221 --> 00:10:12.890
This is already a fact for new projects,

167
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.410
onshore wind and solar energy are on average,

168
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.990
much cheaper than energy from coal or natural gas.

169
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.650
And that is precisely why the vast majority of new electricity production

170
00:10:21.651 --> 00:10:22.880
capacity is renewable.

171
00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:28.430
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

172
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.670
<v 2>There are other reports that calculate the cost of nuclear energy, even lover,</v>

173
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.860
but renewable was still competitive. Anyway,

174
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:36.920
we'll talk about that in a future video. The fact is that as you can see,

175
00:10:36.921 --> 00:10:38.000
just a decade ago,

176
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:42.680
every megawatt hour produced in a solar photovoltaics plant cost three

177
00:10:42.681 --> 00:10:46.430
times as much as one produced in a coal-fired power plant today,

178
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:50.570
the cost of a solar megawatt hour is less than half of that, of coal.

179
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.750
As long as we're talking about new plants, of course, if, for example,

180
00:10:53.751 --> 00:10:57.350
you already have a gas plant built then during its lifetime,

181
00:10:57.351 --> 00:11:00.380
the production costs for gas will obviously be almost certainly.

182
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.880
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

183
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.980
<v 2>Start from scratch. Then it's a different story. In fact, new photovoltaics,</v>

184
00:11:11.981 --> 00:11:15.590
solar energy installations are beginning to have costs that place them among the

185
00:11:15.591 --> 00:11:19.040
cheapest energy sources in history. And the same could be said of wind energy.

186
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.010
Not only that, the estimate is that over the next few years,

187
00:11:22.011 --> 00:11:25.490
the cost of this energy will continue to fall sharply. So the question,

188
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.120
the big question we can ask ourselves is how on earth has this been possible?

189
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.770
Well, different visual politic.

190
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.500
This has to do with the characteristics of each production system.

191
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:37.040
Let me explain while the cost of electricity generated by fossil fuels depends

192
00:11:37.041 --> 00:11:40.790
largely on the price of the fuel itself, gas, oil, or coal, for example,

193
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.950
the same does not apply to renewable energy

194
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.460
In the case of wind or solar energy,

195
00:11:49.461 --> 00:11:53.170
their cost is almost entirely linked to the cost of the technology and what the

196
00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:54.430
price of the technology. Well,

197
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.930
the story is very similar to what happened with microchips cell phones or data

198
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:03.400
that production costs fall. As the technology develops the combined experience,

199
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:05.470
the accumulation of technological advances,

200
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.540
the small changes that increase efficiency.

201
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.930
It is a song of elements that in the end makes technology more and more

202
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:12.310
accessible. For example,

203
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.810
existing data and studies show that every time the installed solar capacity has

204
00:12:16.811 --> 00:12:21.430
doubled, there has been a 36% drop in costs. In the case of onshore wind energy,

205
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.670
the figure has been 20%. And in the case of offshore wind energy,

206
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.770
10% take a look fast.

207
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.340
Although electricity produced from coal has historically been cheap compared to

208
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.780
photovoltaics solar energy. It is becoming relatively more expensive. Why? Well,

209
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.260
because in addition to the fact that the technology is already highly refined,

210
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.810
the cost of coal is a weighty factor. In fact,

211
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.490
coal accounts for about 40% of the total costs of a coal fired power plant.

212
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.140
And this my friends is what explains,

213
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:49.840
why renewables have become the stars of the energy world.

214
00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.410
And that that is a change that not even the president of the United States can

215
00:12:53.411 --> 00:12:54.244
stop.

216
00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:57.630
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

217
00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:01.080
<v 2>So what I can say is this is fantastic news. On the one hand,</v>

218
00:13:01.081 --> 00:13:04.380
we're talking about a much cheaper energy and that in itself means more

219
00:13:04.381 --> 00:13:06.500
prosperity and a better quality of life for.

220
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:07.883
<v 0>Everyone.</v>

221
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:12.630
Take note.

222
00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:16.050
<v 2>Because that's not the only benefit, the progressive replacement of energy,</v>

223
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:20.730
especially coal plants by renewable energy ones will also reduce carbon dioxide,

224
00:13:20.731 --> 00:13:22.560
emissions and pollution of all kinds.

225
00:13:22.561 --> 00:13:25.890
And that's could prevent the loss of hundreds and hundreds of thousands of

226
00:13:25.891 --> 00:13:29.010
lives, millions even each year. Yes, that's right.

227
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:33.660
International organizations estimate that between five and 8 million people die

228
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:34.583
every year.

229
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:35.843
<v 0>Pollution.</v>

230
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.770
<v 2>You see renewable seem like good news that opened the door to a very hopeful</v>

231
00:13:43.771 --> 00:13:46.980
future cleaner and cheaper energy. What more could you ask for,

232
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:48.750
of course not everything is so beautiful.

233
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.470
There are still issues that need to be resolved such as the reliability of these

234
00:13:52.471 --> 00:13:53.160
technologies.

235
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.820
What happens if the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow so far,

236
00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:00.540
renewable energies need a backup structure that in many cases is hardly ever

237
00:14:00.541 --> 00:14:02.580
used, but it has to be paid for nonetheless,

238
00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:06.720
we have not included this cost if we had done so renewables will still be

239
00:14:06.721 --> 00:14:10.770
competitive, somewhat less. So, but with a tendency towards decreasing costs,

240
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.280
however,

241
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.090
perhaps this can be resolved with the future development of macro energy storage

242
00:14:15.091 --> 00:14:18.960
systems, or perhaps this technology will always have to co-exist with others,

243
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:22.590
but in any case, replacing coal with solar, for example, well, what can I say?

244
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:23.850
It seems like fantastic news.

245
00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:27.690
<v 0>In fact.</v>

246
00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.960
<v 2>Do you know who is betting heavily, very heavily. In fact,</v>

247
00:14:30.961 --> 00:14:34.080
on photovoltaics solar energy, you'll be amazed.

248
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.850
The Petro monarchies of the past.

249
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:36.953
<v 0>Golf.</v>

250
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.250
<v 2>In short, my friends,</v>

251
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.370
these are the key components to today's global energy system.

252
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:54.110
I think you have a better understanding of the renewable energy revolution that

253
00:14:54.111 --> 00:14:56.240
has been set in motion over the past few years.

254
00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:01.040
The question the million dollar question is will we all soon enjoy increased

255
00:15:01.041 --> 00:15:04.880
access to much cheaper energy or will our politicians savagely tax it so that

256
00:15:04.881 --> 00:15:07.430
nothing changes. Leave your answers in the comments before.

257
00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:11.770
<v 3>Finish. We can end this video without wishing you all the best for the holidays.</v>

258
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.720
Even though we already know this, probably won't be anyone's best holiday ever.

259
00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:20.740
We also want to pass on our deepest condolences to every one of you who has lost

260
00:15:20.741 --> 00:15:24.760
an important person during this pandemic. But despite all of that,

261
00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:28.810
the whole team here at visual politics wants to wish you all a happy holidays.

262
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:33.910
I've got my whiskey as a Scotsman. That means main well-being so cheers,

263
00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.310
Merry Christmas, and we'll see you next day.
