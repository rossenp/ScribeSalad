00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:02.940
<v 0>We.</v>

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.550
<v 1>Uh, back in the nineties, the countries of Southeast Asia,</v>

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.160
along with South Korea seem to be taking all the world.

4
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.370
They are the next candidates to join the list of the great economic success

5
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:14.190
stories, banks, investment funds, pension funds,

6
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.610
insurance companies all want to invest in this part of the world.

7
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.210
South Korea and Southeast Asia have become some of the great jewels in the

8
00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:25.050
financial world. However, on the 2nd of July, 1997,

9
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.300
everything fell apart on that day.

10
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.470
One of the greatest financial cataclysms in human history suddenly began to

11
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:33.090
unfold in just a few months.

12
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:36.810
The whole world was going to see how these ones booming and prosperous economies

13
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.860
were about to sink into the ocean.

14
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.773
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.100
<v 1>The fact is that within just a year of the crisis,</v>

16
00:00:43.101 --> 00:00:46.670
breaking out the damage had exceeded all reasonable expectations.

17
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.200
The depreciation of local currencies surpassed 35% in all cases,

18
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.190
in the case of the Indonesia and repair, it was a staggering 83%.

19
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.020
And we're not just talking about currencies.

20
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.740
The same thing happened with the stock markets, the stock markets in Indonesia,

21
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.580
South Korea and Thailand recorded falls over 50%.

22
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.590
<v 0>And take note.</v>

23
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.040
<v 1>In case you didn't catch what that meant. Let me illustrate that in another way.</v>

24
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.330
This means that a dollar denominated investment in stock markets of these

25
00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:19.040
countries would have recorded a loss of between 60 and 93% in just one

26
00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:19.940
year. For example,

27
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.440
$1,000 invested in the South Korean stock market in June,

28
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.070
1997 would have diminished to a 290 position in just 12.

29
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.020
But we're not just talking about the world of finance.

30
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.780
The economies of these countries suffered considerable damage,

31
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.890
suddenly rising unemployment bank failures and business closures became daily

32
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:44.780
news events. In one year, the economy of South Korea registered a fall of 5.8%,

33
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.160
that of Thailand 10%. And that of Indonesia, a little more than 13%.

34
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.880
It was the greater Asian financial crisis of 1996.

35
00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.080
What happened that caused such trending economies of the day to suddenly

36
00:02:00.081 --> 00:02:04.280
collapsed like a house of cards. What were the causes of the Savage crisis?

37
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.980
These are the questions we will try to answer in this new video,

38
00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:09.590
but we have prepared in collaboration with value school, listen.

39
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.690
<v 0>Up the.</v>

40
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.820
<v 1>Asian economic miracle,</v>

41
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.140
July, 1997.

42
00:02:18.141 --> 00:02:21.950
Any analyst had predicted the economic cataclysm that was going to occur during

43
00:02:21.951 --> 00:02:25.370
the following months. It is possible that he or she would have lost their job.

44
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.750
No one, absolutely no one would have taken such a prediction. Seriously,

45
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.180
just one month before the outbreak of the crisis,

46
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.020
the average forecast for economic growth in the region was around 7%.

47
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.590
This was in line with the performance of these economies. In previous years,

48
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.080
at the beginning of 1997,

49
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.950
everything seemed to be in order South Korea and the Southeast Asian countries

50
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.600
had their public accounts. In order,

51
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.660
they had maintained very high levels of economic growth for years.

52
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.110
Inflation was under control and their savings and investment rates were very

53
00:02:54.111 --> 00:02:54.944
high.

54
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.450
<v 0>Nothing.</v>

55
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.060
<v 1>Indicated what was to come on. The contrary, the prospects were good. Very good.</v>

56
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.680
So as you can imagine, investment banks funds, hedge funds, commercial banks,

57
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.130
all the players in the financial world wanted a piece of this kind of equity.

58
00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:19.643
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

59
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.120
<v 1>The inflows of capital that is funds money that's were registered every year</v>

60
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.900
were enormous, which in turn fueled the feeling of prosperity.

61
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.280
The stock markets were rising.

62
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.560
The price of real estate assets just kept growing.

63
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.320
There was money for all kinds of projects and best of all,

64
00:03:34.321 --> 00:03:38.400
with healthy public accounts and an insatiable appetite for investing everything

65
00:03:38.401 --> 00:03:42.120
pointed to the prospect of continued prosperity for the foreseeable future.

66
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.690
Of course,

67
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.470
it was clear that no one could expect such a crisis in countries where even the

68
00:03:46.471 --> 00:03:50.370
governments themselves had fiscal surpluses. However,

69
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.570
we now know that the model had cracks and that that's what we are on a mission

70
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.670
to investigate. What were these cracks?

71
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.880
What happened to make everything fall apart overnight? Well,

72
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.270
the time has come to get to work and examine all of those weak links.

73
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.920
<v 0>The cracks that caused the collapse,</v>

74
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.130
okay.

75
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.200
<v 1>You've already described it in the 1990s,</v>

76
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.070
South Korea and Southeast Asia were enjoying a financial golden era. However,

77
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.770
little by little, some imbalances had developed,

78
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.950
which were not considered important, but that oversight would end up costing.

79
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.940
<v 0>You see.</v>

80
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.020
<v 1>In the early 1990s,</v>

81
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.550
the United States went through a mild economic crisis that ended with the 1991

82
00:04:32.551 --> 00:04:33.060
recession.

83
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.960
This caused the us federal reserve to lower interest rates to well below the

84
00:04:36.961 --> 00:04:40.080
rates that existed in South Korea and Southeast Asian countries.

85
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.260
And this together with the high rates of economic growth that these countries

86
00:04:43.261 --> 00:04:47.190
had been registering is what caused international capital to begin flooding into

87
00:04:47.191 --> 00:04:50.640
this region of the world capital that was added to the very high savings

88
00:04:50.641 --> 00:04:53.160
reserves that these economies already had. In other words,

89
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.460
we are talking about a series of events that suddenly provided money for

90
00:04:56.461 --> 00:05:00.270
everything. There,

91
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.150
there is the point of when the problems began on the one hand,

92
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.690
the price of assets shot up one on the other hand investments in all kinds of

93
00:05:06.691 --> 00:05:09.840
projects, multiplied export industry, which by the way,

94
00:05:09.841 --> 00:05:13.770
was favored by the governments themselves created a huge overcapacity and many

95
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:17.190
of the real estate and public works projects were barely used when they were

96
00:05:17.191 --> 00:05:18.450
finished. In other words,

97
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.500
a lot of capital was being invested in projects whose profitability was more

98
00:05:22.501 --> 00:05:25.680
than questionable. And so bubble was created. And of course,

99
00:05:25.681 --> 00:05:29.190
when the United States began to recover and Alan Greenspan's federal reserve

100
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.120
began to raise interests, the attractiveness of these markets began to decline,

101
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.780
but that's that, wasn't the only problem that they had to worry about.

102
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:39.743
<v 0>The rise.</v>

103
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.410
<v 1>First in the United States led to an appreciation of the dollar and therefore of</v>

104
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.820
the currencies of those countries,

105
00:05:44.821 --> 00:05:47.970
which were patched to the U S currency by a fixed exchange rate.

106
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.480
That in itself was one of the great attractions those countries had for foreign

107
00:05:51.481 --> 00:05:52.410
investors. However,

108
00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:55.770
this appreciation of the currencies with respect to other major currencies,

109
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.000
such as the yen or the Mark caused these Asian countries to lose

110
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:02.000
competitiveness, to make matters worse in 1994,

111
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.360
China had carried out a devaluation of the UN more than 30 years

112
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.270
As a result export growth began to slow down for Southeast Asia and South Korea.

113
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.140
In 1996, this had two consequences. On the one hand,

114
00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.190
it increased the overcapacity of the export sector further reducing the

115
00:06:21.191 --> 00:06:24.250
profitability and even the viability of the investments made.

116
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.210
And on the other hand,

117
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.890
given the massive influx of capital of cash that continued to arrive the loss of

118
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.760
export momentum meant that the current account balance that is the difference

119
00:06:33.761 --> 00:06:36.850
between income and the payments to the rest of the world would register

120
00:06:36.851 --> 00:06:38.350
considerably large deficit.

121
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.700
<v 2>Levels. The fact.</v>

122
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.270
<v 1>Is that the accumulation of current account deficits it's been financed by</v>

123
00:06:46.271 --> 00:06:49.600
foreign debt. So to give you an idea in 1996,

124
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.460
the foreign debt of these countries exceeded 165% of their gross domestic

125
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:56.320
product faced with such a scenario.

126
00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.610
Only one turning point was needed a minor interruption to turn the whole system

127
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.600
upside down. And that's just what happened on the 2nd of July, 1990.

128
00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:08.950
<v 2>Thailand, the turning point.</v>

129
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.210
<v 1>1993 In that year,</v>

130
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.320
taking advantage of the enormous influx of capital that was flooding Southeast

131
00:07:17.321 --> 00:07:17.710
Asia.

132
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:21.250
The Thai government decided to create an entire international financial center

133
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:24.940
in Bangkok with the intention of competing with Singapore and Hong Kong to

134
00:07:24.941 --> 00:07:28.630
achieve this, the Thai government did what it is usually done in such cases.

135
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:30.880
It ease regulations on the capital market,

136
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.630
introduced tax incentives and promoted the creation of a whole financial

137
00:07:34.631 --> 00:07:35.200
industry.

138
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.040
And the truth is that things began to go in the right direction soon and was

139
00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:43.180
specializing in foreign exchange lending operations that is borrowing capital

140
00:07:43.181 --> 00:07:45.250
nominated in major international currencies,

141
00:07:45.251 --> 00:07:49.150
such as the dollar and channeling it into all types of investment projects in

142
00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:50.680
local currency. In this way,

143
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.880
Bangkok became one of the great gateways to the economies of Southeast Asia.

144
00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:59.200
What happened is that his experience as a financial center was very limited and

145
00:07:59.201 --> 00:08:02.290
the regulations, well, let's just say they were pretty ineffective.

146
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:04.960
<v 2>But.</v>

147
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.190
<v 1>Do you remember what else was happening?</v>

148
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.880
The enormous influx of capital into this part of the world meant that large

149
00:08:09.881 --> 00:08:13.270
amounts of resources were invested in projects that would never be profitable

150
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:14.890
resources. That's don't forget,

151
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.710
came from loans that there was little hope of paying back.

152
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.490
And that is precisely what led to a growing deterioration in the credit

153
00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:24.730
portfolios of Thai financial institutions, or in other words,

154
00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.140
a whole lot more default,

155
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:30.040
take a look according to estimates made after the crisis by the international

156
00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:33.160
monetary fund loans in an erratic situation that is,

157
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.790
that began to have problems being repaid or paying interest reached levels of

158
00:08:36.791 --> 00:08:39.280
between 15 and 24%. However,

159
00:08:39.281 --> 00:08:42.250
despite the fact that these were figures that could make any analyst hair stand

160
00:08:42.251 --> 00:08:45.040
on end, none of this appeared in the bank's annual accounts,

161
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.790
lacks financial rules and lack of experience and supervision meant that loans in

162
00:08:48.791 --> 00:08:52.960
irregular situations were refinanced without being classified as dubious.

163
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.340
And not only that interest that had never actually been received was also

164
00:08:56.341 --> 00:09:00.240
usually accounted for and many companies in trouble were lent even more money to

165
00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:03.810
pay off interest. They already owed on previous loans. That's just crazy.

166
00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:09.440
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

167
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.640
<v 1>Is that with these techniques,</v>

168
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.630
profits were plumped up allowing financial institutions to distribute dividends,

169
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:19.550
give out huge bonuses and pay taxes, but all financed with more and more debt.

170
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:23.060
It was a crazy race to collapse that continued until it was simply too late

171
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.660
because of the tiny financial institutions finally ran out of money and began to

172
00:09:26.661 --> 00:09:29.060
have trouble meeting their international creditors.

173
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.880
Remember that they had specialized in raising capital from the rest of it.

174
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.713
<v 2>The world.</v>

175
00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.940
<v 1>The situation became so critical that between the months of March and June,</v>

176
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:40.970
1997,

177
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.480
the central bank of Thailand secretly had to provide liquidity to the country's

178
00:09:44.481 --> 00:09:48.260
financial institutions at bargain interest rates using its international

179
00:09:48.261 --> 00:09:48.890
reserves.

180
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.250
The problem was that these reserves began to be consumed very quickly and

181
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.610
there's the situation of the banks continue to worsen. On the 2nd of July,

182
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.990
the Thai government was forced to announce the end of the fixed parity of its

183
00:09:59.991 --> 00:10:03.470
currency. The bot would no longer be pegged to the U S dollar.

184
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.730
They no longer had anything to back up a currency that began to suffer enormous

185
00:10:07.731 --> 00:10:10.840
stress in the face of the capital flight that was beginning to take.

186
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:17.750
<v 2>As you can.</v>

187
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.080
<v 1>And imagine the end of the association with the dollar resulted in a huge</v>

188
00:10:21.081 --> 00:10:21.920
collapse of the bot,

189
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.940
which far from improving the situation of the banks only aggravated it. Why?

190
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.670
Well, because the banks had taken out loans in dollars.

191
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:32.630
That is its liabilities were denominated in dollars and its assets in local

192
00:10:32.631 --> 00:10:33.140
currency.

193
00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:37.220
They owed dollars and had nothing to pay the back with in July in 1997,

194
00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.660
the IMF estimated that the whole amounted to at least 9% of Thailand's GDP,

195
00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:45.050
an overwhelming majority of the financial entities were bankrupt.

196
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.090
And according to the IMF own technicians,

197
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.280
only the biggest banks would manage to stay afloat,

198
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.940
suddenly international depositors and investors saw the writing on the wall,

199
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:53.990
not only in Thailand,

200
00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.830
but also in all countries of the region that shared the same economic

201
00:10:57.831 --> 00:10:58.730
characteristics,

202
00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.630
foreign lines of credit dried up and capital flight drags down the entire

203
00:11:02.631 --> 00:11:06.350
financial systems of these countries. The contagion effect was total.

204
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:09.370
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

205
00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.470
<v 1>In 1996, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia,</v>

206
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:17.150
the Philippines and Thailand had received $66 billion from abroad in net terms

207
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.240
in 97, they received just $36 billion.

208
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.090
The variation amounted to $112 billion,

209
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.730
12% of the combined GDP of these nations at the time,

210
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.790
the crisis was first felt in Thailand, but in less than two months,

211
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.180
it turned into a full blown Asian crisis in just one month,

212
00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:37.070
the South Korean one sank from 1000 to 2001 on the dollar in just

213
00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:41.420
one month, just a few weeks after the outbreak of the crisis in Thailand,

214
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.450
the forecast for economic growth in these countries changed abruptly.

215
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:45.783
<v 2>Hello</v>

216
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.340
in this is the story.

217
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:59.050
<v 1>Of the 1997 Asian crisis. One of the biggest financial crises in history,</v>

218
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.800
a crisis that forced the Asian countries involved to carry out enormous

219
00:12:02.801 --> 00:12:06.370
restructuring and to receive bailouts of $120 billion.

220
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.240
Despite this only South Korea managed to recover in a reasonably short amount of

221
00:12:10.241 --> 00:12:13.780
time, we are talking about a crisis that had a lot of consequences for about the

222
00:12:13.781 --> 00:12:15.430
financial world consequences,

223
00:12:15.431 --> 00:12:18.670
which we will surely talk about here on visual politics in collaboration with

224
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.830
value school. So I really hope you enjoyed this video.
