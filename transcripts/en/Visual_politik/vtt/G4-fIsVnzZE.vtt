00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.390
<v 1>The coronavirus crisis has dragged one issue to the center of the table.</v>

2
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.290
Fake news.

3
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.220
To what extent does freedom of speech protect people who publish news that is

4
00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:19.700
simply lies over the past few months, we've seen all sorts of websites,

5
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.630
even YouTube channels say all sorts of outrageous things about the coronavirus.

6
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.380
And we're not just talking about conspiracy theories either. For example,

7
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.790
many websites have recommended.

8
00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:36.560
Barbarities such as drinking bleach to cure COVID-19. This is false bleach.

9
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.900
Doesn't cure coronavirus, and it's poisonous.

10
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.480
If anyone has considered following any of these tips,

11
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.300
and I can't believe I have to say this, please don't do it. But so much.

12
00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:47.390
Fake news has led many governments to consider creating laws,

13
00:00:47.391 --> 00:00:49.970
to prevent anyone from publishing misleading facts.

14
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.820
And we're not just talking about governments platforms like this one that we're

15
00:00:52.821 --> 00:00:56.570
on now, YouTube or similar ones like Facebook have taken action such.

16
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.463
<v 0>As this.</v>

17
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.350
<v 2>That was Facebook dealing with fake news through third-party factor.</v>

18
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.830
<v 1>Exactly. Everyone is trying to solve the problem of fake news.</v>

19
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.150
Even many YouTubers are actively asking that YouTube itself act forcefully

20
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.160
against some channels that promote hoaxes.

21
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.980
And that's when this story comes up and makes us all rethink everything we

22
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:16.850
thought about the truth.

23
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.700
<v 2>Is how wired card went from analysts, darling,</v>

24
00:01:22.701 --> 00:01:26.990
to a $2.2 billion accounting scandal business insider.

25
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.190
<v 1>No. What you're thinking,</v>

26
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.180
what does a financial scandal have to do with fake news? Well, a lot,

27
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.750
believe me,

28
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.080
we're talking about one of the biggest financial scandals in German history,

29
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.220
a scandal that includes fraud of more than 1.9 billion euros,

30
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.650
not only by German authorities and able to see it.

31
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.520
They also called all those who sounded the first alarm conspirators and

32
00:01:46.521 --> 00:01:47.930
spreaders of fake news.

33
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.290
I know what a lot of you are probably thinking why a card it's the first time

34
00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:53.660
I've ever heard of this company? Well, yes, it's true.

35
00:01:53.661 --> 00:01:55.820
That Wirecard is not the most well-known brand,

36
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.860
but I'm sure you've all used their services.

37
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.170
There's one of the largest payment processing companies in the world.

38
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.980
If you've bought something online, you've unknowingly used Wirecard technology,

39
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.180
especially if you've paid for something related to gambling sites or porn. Yes.

40
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.570
This German startup had specialized in that particular niche market.

41
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.120
And I know what a lot of you are thinking online payments. Well,

42
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.430
I'm sure this company is making a mint right now.

43
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.310
If there's one sector that's benefited from the coronavirus crisis,

44
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.970
it's got to be the online market at a time when we've all bought things online,

45
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.090
online payment companies have increased their business a lot.

46
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.330
So why can't has to be making a lot of money, right? Well,

47
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.160
nothing could be further from the truth.

48
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.053
<v 0>Check it out.</v>

49
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.580
<v 2>Wirecard collapses into insolvency, June 25th, 20,</v>

50
00:02:43.581 --> 00:02:44.990
20 financial times.

51
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.560
<v 1>If, why can't I just become famous for anything in recent months?</v>

52
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.980
It's because it's been part of the biggest financial scandal of the year.

53
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.880
Apparently half of its business has been invented. And here's the juiciest part.

54
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.410
All of this was happening while the German authorities not only turned blind

55
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.860
eye, but they even denounced the journalist who investigated the story.

56
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.580
What were they accusing him of fake news and market manipulation.

57
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.010
You may be surprised, but unlike the traditional press,

58
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.500
the economic press is often much more regulated.

59
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.590
If a financial analyst publishes false information about a company,

60
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.070
it can sink or raise that company's valuation on the stock exchange.

61
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.530
And so there are laws that try to avoid this,

62
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.250
the problem. Well, sometimes these loads can end up chasing the wrong people.

63
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.600
So this video can serve as a cautionary tale about fake news finance and the

64
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:32.680
price of truth.

65
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.250
Because the questions we're asking today are what exactly is the wire card

66
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:38.620
scandal? What did the public authorities fail to do?

67
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.880
Why did they not see this coming?

68
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:42.790
How can things like this be prevented from happening again today,

69
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:45.550
we go to answer these questions, but first let's look at some history.

70
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.630
<v 0>It's a great European.</v>

71
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.710
<v 1>Imagine that you have an e-commerce store and that you sell Hawaiian shirts</v>

72
00:03:55.711 --> 00:03:57.810
online. I buy a shirt from you for 10 euros.

73
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.810
That means that at the end of the transaction, there should be 10 euros,

74
00:04:00.811 --> 00:04:05.220
less in my bank accounts and 10 euros more in yours so far, it all makes sense.

75
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.330
The question is who verifies that both your bank and mine have registered that

76
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.430
St. John's is all your bank is different from mine,

77
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.080
especially if we're in different countries.

78
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.380
So registering such sales is the work of electronic payment company.

79
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.880
<v 0>And I'm sure.</v>

80
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.540
<v 1>You already know a lot of companies in this sector, MasterCard visa, well,</v>

81
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.530
Wirecard is a platform that allows your e-commerce sites to accept most,

82
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.630
all the different payment methods in the world.

83
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.510
If I want to pay you with these or MasterCard or any other system,

84
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.890
why I call it makes it possible.

85
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.460
<v 3>Customers can put various products from different stores into their shopping</v>

86
00:04:38.461 --> 00:04:42.390
basket and pay with their smartphone in one single transaction.

87
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.270
Are you ready for the future of payment?

88
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.120
<v 1>And this company began in 1919 nine and like so many other internet companies</v>

89
00:04:51.121 --> 00:04:52.410
that were born around that time,

90
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.440
Wirecard nearly disappeared when the.com bubble burst.

91
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.680
If the coronavirus crisis has been the boom time for internet companies,

92
00:04:58.681 --> 00:05:01.050
the 2000 crisis, it was quite the opposite.

93
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.890
And it was at a time when Wirecard was worth less than a roll of toilet paper.

94
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.760
That's the antihero of our story appeared Mr. Marcus Braun

95
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.340
From looking at the bad guy in Robocop,

96
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.900
Marcus Braun had a really great idea to make this company really take off porn

97
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.700
and gambling. You may be surprised,

98
00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:24.180
but these companies are usually completely isolated from the rest of the

99
00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:25.920
e-commerce market. For example,

100
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.520
most payment method companies refuse to work with porn companies. However,

101
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.820
those pages also need payment processing to lots of payments.

102
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.870
So why a card became the only payment company that didn't discriminate against

103
00:05:36.871 --> 00:05:38.460
adult entertainment conclusion,

104
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.750
Ron bought a dilapidated business and five years later was entering the German

105
00:05:42.751 --> 00:05:47.070
stock exchange. That's right. And what did they want to do this for? Well,

106
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.160
they needed quick funding to be able to take the next step international

107
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.023
expansion.

108
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.470
<v 0>And.</v>

109
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.720
<v 1>Now I want you to keep this fact mind at that time, the Wirecard share price.</v>

110
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:02.900
Was it five euros? Remember this number because it's important,

111
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.470
five euros per share. We have all that liquidity provided by multiple investors.

112
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.750
Why can't make the bigly in 2007,

113
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.590
they opened an office in Singapore and hired the second antihero in this story.

114
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.620
[inaudible] director of Wirecard in Asia, and

115
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.740
Exactly another gentleman who also looks like the bad guy in a B-movie.

116
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:26.890
And what was this man's strategy for conquering Asia? Well,

117
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.050
very easy by everything that moved suddenly,

118
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.290
Wirecard went out to buy all kinds of small businesses that offered online

119
00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:35.350
payments in local markets, a small company in the Philippines,

120
00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.420
another company in Dubai and so on.

121
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:42.010
So that by 2014 Wirecard already offered services in Australia, New Zealand,

122
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.880
South Africa, and Turkey. By now the share price had already climbed to 30.

123
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.740
<v 0>That's yeah.</v>

124
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.850
<v 1>In less than 10 years,</v>

125
00:06:51.851 --> 00:06:55.600
it had multiplied its value by six shareholder meetings looked like birthday

126
00:06:55.601 --> 00:06:58.720
parties every year was better than the last, but make no mistake.

127
00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:59.680
Even at that time,

128
00:06:59.681 --> 00:07:02.170
there were signs that things were too good to be true by then,

129
00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:04.630
the financial times had already begun to be suspicious.

130
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.800
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

131
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.000
<v 2>Wirecard is a little known German tech stock worth 5 billion Euro and the</v>

132
00:07:13.001 --> 00:07:15.400
puzzle. It grows at breakneck pace, but bias,

133
00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:17.620
obscure payment companies around the world,

134
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.570
which keep the growth going financial times.

135
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:23.530
<v 1>This article is from 2050 and it basically posts one big question.</v>

136
00:07:23.531 --> 00:07:27.400
How is it possible that they bought ruined or failing companies in Asia and that

137
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.980
in just one year, make them so profitable?

138
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.510
No one was able to explain it for sure.

139
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.870
And this should have prompted the financial authorities to start analyzing this

140
00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:35.920
company in Germany.

141
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.100
The authority that handles these things is called the Baffin. However,

142
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.520
they didn't seem to be up to the job of getting inside the company to carry out

143
00:07:42.521 --> 00:07:45.460
inspections, why it was a great German miracle,

144
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.510
something like a European Facebook that any country would dream of having to

145
00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:51.040
give you an idea. In 2016,

146
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.460
they bought the online payments division of city group. In other words,

147
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.860
they entered the U S market through the front door.

148
00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.070
They did something similar in Brazil by then the share price was already more

149
00:08:00.071 --> 00:08:04.540
than 46 euros. And at that time, 2017, a German magazine published this.

150
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.520
<v 2>50 Million Euro puzzle of the Wirecard stock market,</v>

151
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.880
miracle manager, magazine dot D E basically.

152
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.180
<v 1>Why? I can't say that they bought payment companies in Asia that were virtually</v>

153
00:08:22.181 --> 00:08:24.880
unknown and worth every little. They took their client portfolio,

154
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.950
restructured the company and inside a year,

155
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:29.770
they were making profits to put it another way. In just five years,

156
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.150
Wirecard was already tripling its profits more over in January, 2019.

157
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.600
Why a card was worth more than Deutsche bank itself? That is it.

158
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.330
Stock market value was higher than Germany's largest bank.

159
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.490
This is when they entered the Dax 30,

160
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.850
which is the index with the largest companies on the German stock exchange.

161
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:50.410
<v 0>[Inaudible] suddenly.</v>

162
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:51.760
<v 1>They were everyone's darling.</v>

163
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.940
They went from being a payments method company that worked with porn pages to

164
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.550
the platform used by more than 100 airlines and supermarket chains like Aldi.

165
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.860
But then the stock price was way up at 190.

166
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:07.280
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

167
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.860
<v 1>Of course, this is nothing compared to Amazon or Facebook,</v>

168
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.140
but it's still a good result. In 15 years,

169
00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.890
the stock had gone from five-year-olds for the 190 rows. It's not bad at all.

170
00:09:15.891 --> 00:09:19.370
Is it? Well, all of a sudden, just when everyone was gushing over Wirecard,

171
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.680
the stock price started to fall for the first time.

172
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.400
And you'll probably wondering why.

173
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:24.583
<v 0>Look at this,</v>

174
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.850
the stock market Maverick.

175
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:32.390
<v 1>What if I told you that you could make money when a stock price falls,</v>

176
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.960
that is technically you can buy shares of companies that you think are going to

177
00:09:35.961 --> 00:09:40.100
get worse. This technique is called short selling. I'll tell you how it works.

178
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.490
Imagine that you have Wirecard shares in December, 2018,

179
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.110
its market price at that time is 190 euros at that moment. I say, Hey,

180
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:48.920
let me your action.

181
00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.280
And I'll give it back to you in a year with interest you say, okay, great.

182
00:09:52.281 --> 00:09:54.290
I didn't plan on selling it. So knock yourself out.

183
00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:58.880
<v 0>When you.</v>

184
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.110
<v 1>I me, the action. I said it, and I put that $190 per share in my pocket.</v>

185
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.730
I hope that in a year's time,

186
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.460
why I can't shares are going to crash in the stock market.

187
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:11.450
If my calculations are correct in December, 2019, the Wirecard stock will be,

188
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.470
let's say 10 euros. And at that point I buy the stock again for 10 euros,

189
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:19.880
I return it with interest and what I just made 180 euros per share from a

190
00:10:19.881 --> 00:10:23.300
company that's doing badly. As you can imagine, this is a very risky practice.

191
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.600
And usually people who buy short are usually a very particular type of.

192
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:27.463
<v 0>Investor.</v>

193
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:32.840
<v 1>A short sellers. I mean,</v>

194
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.270
they're basically people who are going against the market.

195
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.370
Think about it in January, 2019,

196
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.410
why our client was going from strength to strength.

197
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.430
The German Baffin claimed that the company had all its accounts in order Ernest

198
00:10:43.431 --> 00:10:43.850
and young,

199
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.480
which is the company that audited its accounts confirmed that why cards business

200
00:10:47.481 --> 00:10:50.750
had no problems. In other words, all sources of authority said,

201
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.280
why a card is the future.

202
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.250
You'd have to be crazy to buy short with a company like that. Right? Well,

203
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:59.000
that's kind of the way that short sellers are a kind of unique tribe within the

204
00:10:59.001 --> 00:11:01.430
world of finance. Something like conspiracy theorists,

205
00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:05.270
but with one difference in this case, your truth comes at a price.

206
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.390
You're putting your money on the line because you really think something's not

207
00:11:08.391 --> 00:11:10.100
going as well as everyone else believes.

208
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:18.530
Short investors usually have very bad reputation at the end of the day.

209
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.470
They benefit when everything goes wrong for almost everyone else.

210
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.070
And all of that explains why then February, 2019, we found a story.

211
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:30.230
<v 0>Like this boss in bans,</v>

212
00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:33.140
short sales of Wirecard shares after market cap.

213
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.950
<v 1>Exactly the German financial authorities wanting to protect their little</v>

214
00:11:36.951 --> 00:11:37.610
Facebook.

215
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:41.060
They didn't want a bunch of short term investors sinking the company at the end

216
00:11:41.061 --> 00:11:44.330
of the day. If other investors see how many people there are buying short,

217
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.880
the stock price is likely to drop and no one wanted them.

218
00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:48.403
<v 0>Fall down.</v>

219
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:51.560
<v 1>At the time.</v>

220
00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.570
Those lone wolves betting against Wirecard was seen as the classic conspirators

221
00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.340
in tinfoil hats. And of course,

222
00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.430
many thought that the financial times was publishing a series of fake news

223
00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:01.930
articles. And as we said at the beginning,

224
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.330
fake news in the world of finance is punishable.

225
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.300
<v 2>Often the German financial watchdog has filed a criminal complaint against two</v>

226
00:12:12.301 --> 00:12:16.050
financial times journalists and several short sellers accusing them of potential

227
00:12:16.051 --> 00:12:20.370
market manipulation over reports about suspected accounting irregularities at

228
00:12:20.371 --> 00:12:20.970
Wirecard.

229
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:21.930
<v 1>I know what you're all thinking.</v>

230
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.080
That's a bit much the German state was fighting the only ones who were telling

231
00:12:25.081 --> 00:12:28.740
the truth. And yes, it's true. Now that we know how the story ends.

232
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.690
It's easy to say it was an injustice,

233
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.020
but what would you have thought if you had read this news in 2019,

234
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.010
what would you have afford?

235
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.370
If you had been told that a newspaper is publishing fake news and that they're

236
00:12:38.371 --> 00:12:39.420
being taken to court,

237
00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:42.540
would you have said it was an injustice or maybe you would have been happy that

238
00:12:42.541 --> 00:12:45.390
something was finally being done about fake news leaks?

239
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.280
I'll leave it to you to think about in any case,

240
00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:51.270
not even baffles efforts served to prevent Wirecard from failing there's enough.

241
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.290
<v 2>The scandal that rocks Germany.</v>

242
00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:02.670
<v 1>October, 2019, why a card stock price is now at 110 euros.</v>

243
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.220
As much as Baffin has banned short term purchases.

244
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:07.500
The financial times continues to publish analysis.

245
00:13:07.501 --> 00:13:10.530
That leaves the company looking far from being in a good position.

246
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.830
They still don't understand how it's possible to buy small businesses in Asia

247
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.520
and achieve so much profit in such a short amount of time. And around that time,

248
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:19.860
when the market was starting to turn its back on Wirecard,

249
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:22.020
the company came together and made this decision.

250
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:29.070
<v 2>Wirecard hires KPMG for independent audit after financial times allegation.</v>

251
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.830
<v 1>In case that headline didn't sink in. Let me explain.</v>

252
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.890
Large companies are required to let another outside company review their

253
00:13:34.891 --> 00:13:35.221
accounts.

254
00:13:35.221 --> 00:13:38.490
Periodically these companies that review the accounts of other companies are

255
00:13:38.491 --> 00:13:40.470
called auditors' in today's global economy.

256
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.420
There are four major audit companies,

257
00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:45.930
which are often called the big four Deloitte PricewaterhouseCoopers.

258
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.310
Ewind formerly known as Ernst and young and K P M G until this point,

259
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.470
Eli had audited Wirecard accounts,

260
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.580
but since the market continued not to trust Wirecard, they said, okay,

261
00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.160
we're going to be audited externally. So you can feel calmer.

262
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:03.090
And probably the fact that KPMG was hired was also by design,

263
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.440
after rule Marcus Braun,

264
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.830
CEO of the company that looks like the bad guy from Robocop had previously

265
00:14:07.831 --> 00:14:09.060
worked at KPMG.

266
00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:12.870
He probably thought his KPMG friends would be more sympathetic to him than any

267
00:14:12.871 --> 00:14:16.230
other auditors. However, this move could not have gone any worse.

268
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:17.093
Take a look at this.

269
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:24.480
<v 2>Wirecard bombs again, following a devastating KPMG special audit report.</v>

270
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:28.860
<v 1>Basically both Eli and KPMG discovered that Wirecard had invented</v>

271
00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:33.240
1.9 billion euros in profits. Exactly. According to Leichhardt,

272
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:35.910
you were unstoppable in the Philippines. According to them,

273
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.450
almost all Philippine residents use their systems so successful.

274
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:44.040
Have they been in this country that they had revenues of 1.9 billion euros so

275
00:14:44.041 --> 00:14:47.670
far everyone had believed these figures at the end of the day. Why would,

276
00:14:47.671 --> 00:14:48.630
why they can't lie?

277
00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.740
Who's going to go all the way to the Philippines to check if the business or

278
00:14:51.741 --> 00:14:53.150
not. Well, at this point,

279
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:57.290
someone did decide to approach Wirecard alleged offices in Manila with such

280
00:14:57.291 --> 00:15:00.500
turnover. You would imagine a huge glimmering building, right? Well,

281
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.950
none of that, the Philippines Wirecard empire was housed in a humble office,

282
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.690
shared with a bus company, but it doesn't end there.

283
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.360
The Philippines central bank claimed that it barely knew why

284
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.700
With such a huge business,

285
00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.310
why call it should have been investigated by the central bank.

286
00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.900
What's more under Philippine law.

287
00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:24.310
If a company's volume exceeds 5% of the foreign currency reserves hold by an

288
00:15:24.311 --> 00:15:25.300
entire country,

289
00:15:25.301 --> 00:15:28.420
they're required to want to go and inspection 2 billion would have been more

290
00:15:28.421 --> 00:15:31.720
than enough to warrant a routine inspection by the authorities. However,

291
00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:34.840
why our current Philippines was a house of cards. As you can imagine,

292
00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.350
as soon as this news was discovered why cards managers began to drop like flies.

293
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.330
<v 2>[Inaudible] police raid Wirecard entities in Singapore after reports of fraud,</v>

294
00:15:46.331 --> 00:15:47.770
allegations of payments, giant

295
00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:56.740
wildcards, former CEO, Marcus Bron arrested after $2 billion scandal explodes.

296
00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.350
<v 1>Why call? It has already filed for bankruptcy.</v>

297
00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:02.560
And some of its managers have gone missing the company's attorney denies.

298
00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:04.690
Having had any contact with his client.

299
00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.930
The chief accountant is missing in the Philippines and the whole world is

300
00:16:07.931 --> 00:16:09.190
starting to distrust Germany.

301
00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:12.250
If the financial authorities in that country failed to see this scandal,

302
00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.310
how many other companies could be up to something similar for the time being the

303
00:16:15.311 --> 00:16:18.880
names of Baffin officials who are directly involved in this scandal are only

304
00:16:18.881 --> 00:16:21.370
beginning to emerge. Think about it in this case,

305
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.790
it is simply not that the authorities were not able to detect fraud.

306
00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.850
It is that they actively worked to silence all those who ran.

307
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:33.310
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

308
00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:36.430
<v 1>So now the question is over to you. How could this scandal have been avoided?</v>

309
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.630
Who controls the regulators?

310
00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:41.140
