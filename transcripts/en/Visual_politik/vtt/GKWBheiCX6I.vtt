00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.400
<v 0>This video is brought to you by a news voice.</v>

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.770
The news is broken almost all us media is owned by just a handful of big

3
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:11.160
corporations. Fake news is obviously a huge problem as well.

4
00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:13.140
And finding something on bias can be hard.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.570
News voice is revolutionizing the news landscape.

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.230

as well as international and independent media giving some much needed balance.

9
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.860
Each new story shows multiple sources,

10
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.230
which are all tagged with their bias and perspective.

11
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.160
The news affects almost everything in our lives. What we hear and read shapes,

12
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.670
which persons we trust, what we eat, what we buy, how we vote,

13
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.330
even how we think news voices created by its readers. As you can,

19
00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:59.610
on both Google play and the Apple app store. And let's get into the video.

20
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.880
<v 1>[Inaudible] together.</v>

21
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.450
<v 0>China and India make up a third of the world's population yet,</v>

22
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.990
while it may seem hard to believe these countries have large areas of their

23
00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:17.750
territory, where there is absolutely no one.

24
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.630
And one of those areas is the border between these two countries.

25
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.853
<v 1>Streets.</v>

26
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.610
<v 0>We're talking about a 3,500 kilometer stretch that crosses the Himalayas and</v>

27
00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:30.710
where there are hardly any human settlements.

28
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.770
Basically there's the Yeti and not much else. In other words,

29
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.690
the Chinese and the Indians share a border,

30
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.390
but they don't see much of each other. And given what I've seen,

31
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.890
that's probably a good thing. Every time,

32
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:43.190
a Chinese border patrol and an Indian border patrol, cross paths,

33
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.340
they end up calling each other names and then beating each other up. And no,

34
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.130
this is not just a metaphor. It's very real.

35
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.840
We're talking about real fistfights.

36
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.310
There are a lot more common than you might think.

37
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.490
We're talking about two countries that have had a Rocky relationship for

38
00:01:55.491 --> 00:01:57.650
decades. And this is especially worrying.

39
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.550
When we consider that we are talking about two nations that make up a third of

40
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:03.530
the world's population. In other words, news,

41
00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:06.860
like this is a bit of concern to all of us because it could be the beginning.

42
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.450
<v 1>By third world war</v>

43
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.700
20 Indian soldiers killed in first deadly clashes with Chinese troops and

44
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:18.350
45 years.

45
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.730
<v 0>And you're probably wondering,</v>

46
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.820
but why do the Chinese and Indians get along so badly? Well,

47
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.390
the border that separates them is the subject of a never ending dispute.

48
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.100
Look at this map produced by algebra.

49
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.370
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

50
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.310
<v 0>On the Western border is where the current class took place.</v>

51
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.200
The Navy blue part is Kashmir.

52
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.820
Some of Kashmir is controlled by Pakistan and the rest by India in sky blue is

53
00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:45.380
the science shin glacier seized by India from Pakistan in orange is the area of

54
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.810
AXA chin currently controlled by China,

55
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.710
but also claimed by India there in the Galilean Valley is where a deadly

56
00:02:51.711 --> 00:02:53.630
confrontation recently took place.

57
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.110
But hold on a moment because the rest of the border is also a ticking time bomb

58
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.660
in the East is the Indian state of origin child Pradesh claimed by China as its

59
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.800
own territory since occupying Tibet and between Nepal and Bhutan,

60
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.610
there is a small strip of land, the ancient kingdom of Sikkim, which also.

61
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.970
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

62
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.570
<v 0>In fact, Chinese and Indian troops clashed in this area in 2017.</v>

63
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.260
And they clashed as usual equals a punch up. And I repeat,

64
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.830
this is not a metaphor. We're talking about one of the few cases of violent,

65
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.580
but not armed conflicts in the world. All fights are pretty scrappy.

66
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.260
And I know what you're thinking, really.

67
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.470
They really solve their problems with punches. Well, the truth is yes,

68
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.840
punching and diplomacy in 2017,

69
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.040
China's president Zhang ping and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi met in a

70
00:03:41.041 --> 00:03:43.410
Chinese city. It looked like everything was going to be okay,

71
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.870
but the truth is all those good vibes have vanished.

72
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.260
And it seems there are cities in China that just seemed to attract bad luck

73
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.930
because yes, my dear friends of visual politic,

74
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.740
I bet you can't guess which city they decided to host this summit in,

75
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.820
see for yourselves.

76
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.270
<v 1>Woo Han spirit has given new momentum to India.</v>

77
00:04:03.271 --> 00:04:05.310
China ties prime minister Modi.

78
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.600
<v 0>Exactly. Move on like this deal was cast from the start.</v>

79
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.500
And now in 2020 tensions between China and India are once again,

80
00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:16.830
front and center in the media, just like the city of UConn.

81
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.940
So today's questions are to what extent could there be an open war between China

82
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.060
and India? What could happen with all this board attention today?

83
00:04:24.061 --> 00:04:26.790
We're going to answer these questions, but first let's look at some history.

84
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.830
<v 1>Colossal.</v>

85
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.030
<v 0>China and India are two civilizations that have had cultural,</v>

86
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.710
religious and commercial ties for more than 2,500 years. In theory,

87
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.490
they are not doomed to be enemies, but the reality is they get along terribly,

88
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.290
especially since China occupied Tibet in 1950 and the two civilizations suddenly

89
00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:51.840
became neighbors. So what's all the fuss about. Let's see.

90
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.100
The first thing to explain is that to bet is a vast and remote territory.

91
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.700
Tibet is where Buddha lost his lighter and the land mass is as big as South

92
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.430
Africa. That's about twice as big as France. If independent,

93
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.730
it would be one of the 25 largest countries in the world.

94
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.610
But as you can imagine, it is virtually unpopulated,

95
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.670
only two inhabitants per square kilometer. To give you an idea,

96
00:05:14.671 --> 00:05:18.180
it's the same population density as in the Western Sahara. However,

97
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.390
the location of its borders has been the main cause of confrontation between

98
00:05:21.391 --> 00:05:23.400
China and India for seven decades,

99
00:05:23.401 --> 00:05:25.650
because like so many other international conflicts,

100
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.460
the problems arise once again, from the time of the British empire,

101
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.470
As we have explained in previous videos,

102
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.170
Imperial China always had implements over to bet,

103
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.910
but at the beginning of the 20th century,

104
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.580
the forbidden city of Beijing was not at its strongest.

105
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.960
So the British took advantage of the Chinese weakness and invaded Tibet,

106
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.840
but its interests was not to keep the region. Instead,

107
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.480
the British and the Dalai Lama came to an agreement.

108
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.900
The tele Dharma would rule an independent Tibet and in return,

109
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.550
the British would extend their domains of the British Raj in India at the

110
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:00.290
expense of Tibetan territory.

111
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.770
So what's the problem that back then there was no Google earth and the British

112
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.720
made a terrible mess with the maps.

113
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.600
How do you draw a border in the Himalayas without satellites?

114
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.020
Do you put a marker on the summit of Everest? What about customs?

115
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.610
Where do you put them? It seems foolish,

116
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.940
but defining borders in such a mountainous area is almost impossible.

117
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:20.420
And to all that explains the need for so many regions that are practically no

118
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:21.254
man's land.

119
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.780
<v 1>On the West.</v>

120
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.070
<v 0>And border that of Kashmir.</v>

121
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.000
There were some British maps that said the territory of AXA chin was within the

122
00:06:31.001 --> 00:06:32.740
rule of the British empire of India,

123
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.140
but this was not the case in other British maps.

124
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.960
And the confusion continues to this day. Take a look at the current map,

125
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.720
the striped area, which you can see is as big as Switzerland.

126
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.230
It is officially part of China, but nevertheless, India claims.

127
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.750
<v 1>The situation.</v>

128
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.240
<v 0>And on the Eastern border is clearer in 1914,</v>

129
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.840
the United Kingdom and Tibet signed a treaty that defined the North Eastern

130
00:06:55.841 --> 00:06:59.860
border of British India. According to what became known as the McMahan line,

131
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.700
this meant that's a bet gave the Aaron child Pradesh region to the British crown

132
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.790
run trial. Pradesh is a little larger than the Czech Republic.

133
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.940
And twice as big as the controversial acts I chin area.

134
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.510
The fact is that China protested and disagreed with the marking of this border.

135
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.450
But when India became independent in 1947,

136
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.900
it adopted the Mac Mohan line as its border with Tibet.

137
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.180
The Dalai Lama agreed but not China.

138
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.110
And China's disagreements became more pronounced after the communist regime

139
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:30.820
occupied Tibet militarily in 1950 and the magma hotline became the

140
00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:32.680
direct border between the two countries.

141
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.740
The new political map was to challenge two competing interests.

142
00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.610
On one hand China's aspiration to restore the ancient borders of Imperial China.

143
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.880
And on the other hand, Hindu nationalists wanted to preserve British Imperial.

144
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:43.723
<v 1>Reporters.</v>

145
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.160
<v 0>During the 1950s,</v>

146
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.330
both countries sought to avoid direct conflict and respected the McMahan line,

147
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.510
but tension returned to its highest level in 1959.

148
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.520
If you've seen our video onto bet,

149
00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.930
you'll remember that that's the year China suppressed protests in Tibet at the

150
00:08:01.931 --> 00:08:05.530
same time, the Dalai Lama fled to Tibet under the cover of night.

151
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.740
And where did he take refuge? Exactly in India.

152
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.450
As you can imagine that didn't make China.

153
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:11.493
<v 1>Are you happy.</v>

154
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.450
<v 0>The way for the events of 1962, when a war between India and China was fought,</v>

155
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.540
China swept to the battalions of India from the area. However,

156
00:08:22.541 --> 00:08:26.380
the conflict had few territorial consequences on the Western border trying to

157
00:08:26.381 --> 00:08:29.290
consolidate its dominance of AXA chin, but in the East,

158
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.430
it withdrew from the conquered areas of orange helper dash and retreated to the

159
00:08:33.431 --> 00:08:34.180
McMahan line,

160
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.590
which today remains the border between the two countries since 1988,

161
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.500
China and India have met to renegotiate this border,

162
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.960
but they've never reached an agreement. While on the other hand,

163
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.200
they do not dare to face each other in battle. Again, either think about it.

164
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.470
India is a nuclear power and know their nuclear weapons.

165
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.510
Aren't just to defend against Pakistan.

166
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.580
Watch what bill Clinton was once told by the den Indian prime minister.

167
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:06.290
<v 2>Have an overt nuclear weapons state on our borders, a state which committed,</v>

168
00:09:06.291 --> 00:09:09.530
armed aggression against India in 1962.

169
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.130
Although our relations with that country have improved in the last decade or so.

170
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:18.110
An atmosphere of distrust persists mainly due to the unresolved border

171
00:09:18.111 --> 00:09:18.710
problem,

172
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:23.180
a tall [inaudible] Indian prime minister between 1998 and

173
00:09:23.181 --> 00:09:24.200
2004.

174
00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:28.130
<v 0>China and India are in what we would call a Mexican standoff.</v>

175
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.950
That is they can't stand one another, but neither side.

176
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.860
There's the start armed conflict because they both have weapons too.

177
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.060
<v 1>No, you liked each other.</v>

178
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.530
<v 0>How did they resolve this standoff? Well, in the weirdest way,</v>

179
00:09:42.531 --> 00:09:46.430
you can imagine a punch up. And again, this is not a metaphor in the 1990s,

180
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.000
China and India agreed that their border patrols can be insulted,

181
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.360
beaten or spat at so long as there are no guns.

182
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.420
You may be surprised to hear that this deal has worked pretty well for decades.

183
00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.420
Indian and Chinese soldiers have been able to vent their resentment,

184
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.370
but without any escalation, meanwhile,

185
00:10:01.371 --> 00:10:04.430
India and China have been able to focus on more important things than

186
00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:08.600
territorial conflicts that is on growing economically three decades later,

187
00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:12.920
China has become factory to the world and India has become the world's service

188
00:10:12.921 --> 00:10:15.080
provider. If you want to make things, you go to China.

189
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:17.150
If you want to hire programmers, you go to India.

190
00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.660
The two countries have grown and territorial conflicts have faded into the

191
00:10:20.661 --> 00:10:21.110
background.

192
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:24.860
So now you're going to wonder what happened in 2020 for the conflict to surface

193
00:10:24.861 --> 00:10:27.140
again. Well, let's take a look at that right now.

194
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.730
<v 2>Pearl necklace versus diamond necklace.</v>

195
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.580
<v 0>China's biggest antagonist is the United States,</v>

196
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.670
but if there's one country that gives him a real headache, it's India.

197
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.010
If you've been following visual politics for some time,

198
00:10:43.011 --> 00:10:46.640
you will know that in previous videos, we have explained China's sugar,

199
00:10:46.641 --> 00:10:48.440
daddy diplomacy. In recent years,

200
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.530
China has not only invested in its belt and road initiative.

201
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:56.000
The so-called new silk road. They also invested in the so-called Pell necklace.

202
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.490
Those of you have watched this channel for a long time.

203
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.850
We know that China relies heavily on its imports of raw materials.

204
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:09.200
For example, 80% of its oil imports pass through the Malacca Strait.

205
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.790
And this means that they have to pass very close to the undermanned and Nicobar

206
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:14.420
islands.

207
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:17.780
These islands are populated by tribes that have barely had contact with the

208
00:11:17.781 --> 00:11:20.540
outside world. The islands are of no concern to anyone,

209
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.210
but they have one very important feature. They belong to India.

210
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.300
That doesn't mean you'll see any Indian policemen passing these islands,

211
00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.280
but legally they're Indian territory.

212
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:31.070
And that means India can send its army there. Wherever it wants.

213
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.450
India needs to do is to deploy its Navy through the Andaman sea,

214
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.870
to cut off the transit of all types of ships through the Malacca Strait,

215
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.960
suddenly China would run out of oil and many other raw materials.

216
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:48.350
And that's why China had developed its Pearl necklace strategy.

217
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.540
The strategy consists of a multi-billion dollar investment in different

218
00:11:55.541 --> 00:11:59.710
countries with access to the Indian ocean China's UN would seek two highly

219
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:00.880
interconnected objectives.

220
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.510
The first would be positioned these countries in such a way that they could not

221
00:12:04.511 --> 00:12:08.140
reject an Alliance in defense of Beijing's strategic interests.

222
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.160
The second objective would be to develop seaports in the Indian ocean that would

223
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.610
in theory, at least not have a military character, even.

224
00:12:15.611 --> 00:12:19.300
So the economic weakness of these countries and their debts to China would make

225
00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:22.660
it truly difficult for them to have the capacity to say no to Beijing.

226
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.210
This is what we on this channel called sugar daddy.

227
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.633
<v 1>Legacy.</v>

228
00:12:29.270 --> 00:12:33.300
<v 0>And I pay for all your whims, but in return, I make you totally dependent on me.</v>

229
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:37.230
So China has already developed a Pearl necklace to surround India with its ports

230
00:12:37.231 --> 00:12:40.340
in Sri Lanka will DBS Pakistan, Bangladesh. And so.

231
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.633
<v 1>Malia.</v>

232
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.470
<v 0>You can imagine this strategy has not made India very happy first because as we</v>

233
00:12:49.471 --> 00:12:50.820
have explained to the antagonism,

234
00:12:50.821 --> 00:12:55.380
they feel towards China has been enormous since the 1962 war second,

235
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:58.680
because they see China as a threat to their own economic growth.

236
00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:03.120
Indeed India refused to join a trade agreement between East Asia and Oceania,

237
00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:07.080
for fear of opening its markets, even more to Chinese products in new Delhi,

238
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.750
they see the trade deficit with China as too high.

239
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.540
That is India buys from China, much more than its sells.

240
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.180
And this trend grows more pronounced year after year,

241
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:16.410
but that's not all true Lanka.

242
00:13:16.411 --> 00:13:20.580
And the Maldives Bangladesh and even Nepal are all countries that India regards

243
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.260
as being in its natural area.

244
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.213
<v 1>Influence.</v>

245
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.480
<v 0>This way.</v>

246
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.830
The Pearl necklace strategy is seen by India as China meddling in its diplomacy.

247
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:35.340
And if all this were not enough that icing on the cake is the friendship between

248
00:13:35.341 --> 00:13:38.700
China and India's arch enemy Pakistan. In other words,

249
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:41.940
there are more and more reasons for India and China to not get on.

250
00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:45.750
Therefore new Delhi has counter attacked with its diamond necklace plan,

251
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.900
a series of alliances with other countries in the region to allow the Indian

252
00:13:48.901 --> 00:13:50.940
Navy access to some of its ports.

253
00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.870
We're talking about countries as scattered as Oman. The say shells, Iran,

254
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.050
Singapore, or last, but certainly not least Indonesia,

255
00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.060
especially this particular port in Sumatra,

256
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.100
because it would be essential to close the store.

257
00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:10.800
<v 1>Did military base in Subang Indonesia can strangle China at the streets.</v>

258
00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.640
<v 0>India has also sought support beyond the Indian ocean.</v>

259
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.650
It has strengthened the quad Alliance,

260
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.580
which includes four powers wary of Chinese awakening. We're talking about India,

261
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.640
Australia, Japan, and the United States in doing this,

262
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.810
it should be remembered that India is breaking with a decades long policy of

263
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.110
non-alignment with respect to global blocks. And you Trelegy.

264
00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.560
They are clearly abandoning by betting on the U S lead block.

265
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.380
Washington has always had frosty relations with India,

266
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:39.990
especially since they developed their nuclear weapons program,

267
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:44.330
but it's been a long time. And now if the white house had to choose, it's clear,

268
00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.193
they would switch.

269
00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:46.613
<v 1>India side.</v>

270
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.430
<v 0>Of course, the breaking of the ice between India and the United States.</v>

271
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.600
Also the noise China,

272
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:57.920
but arguably the biggest afferents to Beijing is India's support for the Tibetan

273
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.760
cause the Dalai Lama lives in India and is China's public enemy. Number one.

274
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:05.060
So as you can see, woo Han spirit is already more of a ghost of the past,

275
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.380
then a hope for the future.

276
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.080
And that's where things were at when tension escalated in Ladakh.

277
00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:10.083
<v 1>Kashmir,</v>

278
00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.820
third world war.

279
00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:19.480
<v 0>Einstein said he didn't know what weapons would be used in the third world war,</v>

280
00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:23.560
but in the fourth sticks and stones. Well, he doesn't seem to be too far off.

281
00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.630
Watch this footage from the end of May, 2020.

282
00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:26.583
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

283
00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.730
<v 0>These soldiers are from the Indian army.</v>

284
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:43.000
They just incepted a light armored vehicle from the Chinese people,

285
00:15:43.001 --> 00:15:45.790
liberation army within their territory. And as you can see,

286
00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.970
it's been greeted as if it were a tax inspector. They stoned it,

287
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.020
forcing it to retreat.

288
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.740
Two weeks after this video was released details of the deadly Galvon Valley

289
00:15:53.741 --> 00:15:56.890
showdown were released, Chinese casualties were not made public.

290
00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.080
What's more at the time of making this video.

291
00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.680
It's not very clear where the injured Indian soldiers were beaten or got

292
00:16:02.681 --> 00:16:04.590
hypothermia after falling into it.

293
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:08.590
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

294
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:12.460
<v 0>What is certain is that we are facing the most significant clash in decades</v>

295
00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.700
between China and India. So why is this happening right now?

296
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.280
India currently has an ultra nationalist government.

297
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.000
One of its most controversial measures has been to remove Kashmir's autonomy.

298
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:25.660
They have said in Kashmir that they do not respond to anyone button new deli and

299
00:16:25.661 --> 00:16:29.380
have dedicated themselves to reinforcing a number of positions in China.

300
00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.650
This is seen as a threat to their claims on the exon chin region,

301
00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.240
which is dominated by Beijing.

302
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.760
And that's not all India has mobilized troops near the border,

303
00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.430
and we're not talking about a few soldiers to give you an idea.

304
00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:43.810
They've built an airfield at a height of 5,000 meters with the highest runway in

305
00:16:43.811 --> 00:16:45.880
the world. They've also built roads like this.

306
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:53.410
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

307
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:56.560
<v 0>Road would make border positions more accessible to the Indian army.</v>

308
00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:00.100
And it seems that this may explain the Chinese interest in the gal. One valid.

309
00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:07.360
<v 1>Somebody to Del lot beg oldie road link makes gall one.</v>

310
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:09.670
<v 0>China took advantage of everyone's attention,</v>

311
00:17:09.671 --> 00:17:14.200
being focused on the pandemic and occupied some 60 hectares, belonging to India,

312
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:17.110
such a move is typically seen as a declaration of war.

313
00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:20.380
But wait a moment because it seems that China took a step back after the deadly

314
00:17:20.381 --> 00:17:22.840
clash and has abandoned its risky positions.

315
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:26.680
Why has Beijing acted like this possibly to give warnings to India?

316
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:28.150
Think about it. Decades ago,

317
00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:31.120
China and India were two equally poor countries today.

318
00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.030
China's economy is five times that of India. Of course,

319
00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:35.920
India has grown a lot in recent years,

320
00:17:35.921 --> 00:17:39.760
but China has grown a lot more and that is reflected in its military budget.

321
00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.100
China has a much better armed army.

322
00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:47.560
<v 1>In India. However, India.</v>

323
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:50.250
<v 0>Still has an ACE up its sleeve it's allies. Again,</v>

324
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.670
the United States is more likely to help India than China. In other words,

325
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.330
we are stuck in a Mexican standoff, India and China hate each other,

326
00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.580
but are unwilling to face off against it.

327
00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:05.593
<v 1>Joe, how are they.</v>

328
00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:07.280
<v 0>Going to solve this hatred? Well,</v>

329
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.130
if the answer decades ago was throwing punches.

330
00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:13.310
Now they're opting for something a little bit more civilized the economy.

331
00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.530
So far, India has already bans Tik TOK.

332
00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.410
We chat and 50 other apps coming from China. In addition,

333
00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.190
it is considering imposing tariffs on more than 1000 products.

334
00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.320
So what's the problem that within India,

335
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:27.650
there are those who want to avoid a trade war because they think it would cause

336
00:18:27.651 --> 00:18:30.260
more damage to India itself than China. However,

337
00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.470
there are some very influential entrepreneurs who have sided with the

338
00:18:33.471 --> 00:18:37.640
government. Look at what Saigon Jindal president of the JSW group says.

339
00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.820
JSW is one of India's largest industrial conglomerates.

340
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:41.923
<v 1>See for yourself.</v>

341
00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:48.350
<v 2>And my friends and cone industrialists are upset as their business with China is</v>

342
00:18:48.351 --> 00:18:51.050
important to maintain healthy margins and continuity.

343
00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:55.490
But this situation has come because of our complacency in blindly accepting

344
00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:59.630
cheaper imports from China rather than developing our own domestic vendors.

345
00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.660
<v 0>Meanwhile, China, India talks on the Lubbock continued,</v>

346
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.060
so we will keep an eye on the upcoming developments.

347
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:06.500
But now the question is over to you.

348
00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:10.250
Do you think that there will eventually be a war between China and India or do

349
00:19:10.251 --> 00:19:13.460
you think that everything will more or less stay the same with more punches and

350
00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.080
tariffs? Leave your answer in the comments.
