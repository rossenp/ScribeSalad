<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.730
<v 1>You all know this, the United States has a problem with racism,</v>

3
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.400
and this was evident long before the murder of George Floyd.

4
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.950
Racism has been debated in this country for decades,

5
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.470
and it's a debate that's been argued from left to, right?

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.950
But United States is not the only country that has a racism problem.

7
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.813
Just take a look.

8
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.500
<v 2>Black people in China,</v>

9
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.820
banned from McDonald's and evicted from their homes over coronavirus fears.

10
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.280
<v 1>And this is just one example. In reality,</v>

11
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.270
racism is a phenomenon that occurs in many countries and with all kinds of races

12
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.520
from India to Rwanda all the way to China.

13
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.890
And you're probably wondering of all the countries in the world.

14
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.730
Why did we want to focus on China to make this video? Well it's for two reasons,

15
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.650
the first is that in recent months,

16
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.330
China has shooted itself in anti-racism rhetoric's to push its foreign policy

17
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.230
during the coronavirus crisis. Every time a country closed borders with China,

18
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.390
that country was accused of being racist.

19
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.820
<v 2>China's Israel, Envoy compares virus, travel bands to Holocaust.</v>

20
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.830
<v 1>However, when it comes to racism,</v>

21
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.000
China is not a country that can preach to us about it without digging too deep,

22
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.380
just four years ago, Chinese television itself broadcast an advert like this.

23
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.713
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

24
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.270
<v 1>And joke say, but how many black people are there in China?</v>

25
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.880
Are we really talking about an oppressed minority?

26
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.210
Is there really a problem with dark skinned people in China? Well,

27
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.140
the truth is that yes, there is, but it's not the worst case of racism.

28
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.880
As we said in the beginning, white people,

29
00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:02.990
aren't the only racists just as blacks. Aren't the only victims of racism.

30
00:02:02.991 --> 00:02:03.770
In reality,

31
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.090
the largest and most oppressed minority are neither black people nor Hispanics.

32
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.380
We're talking about the or minority. Believe me. If China had freedom of speech,

33
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.200
there would be some movement called [inaudible] lives matter,

34
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.360
and you don't believe me. Well, just take a look at this.

35
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.640
<v 2>The fate of weaker Muslims in China, from reeducation camps to.</v>

36
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.180
<v 1>And this leads us to talk about the second reason we're making this video.</v>

37
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.200
What we are going to tell you has received hardly any media attention yet it

38
00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:37.610
puts China's current actions on par with apartheid in South Africa. In fact,

39
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.280
even we were surprised while doing the research for this video,

40
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.630
the more details we discovered,

41
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.180
the more terrible it seemed to us to give you an idea.

42
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.270
China's government recognizes 56 ethnic groups within its immense.

43
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.560
In addition, only one of these groups,

44
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.640
the Han ethnic group represents more than 90% of the population while the other

45
00:02:58.641 --> 00:03:03.370
50 minority groups make up less than 10% could bind so far. So good, right?

46
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.590
This means that they recognize diversity.

47
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.920
There must be specific rights for minorities. Yes, but no.

48
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.540
If you are a Chinese citizen,

49
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.680
your national identity card has to state what ethnicity or minority group you

50
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:16.840
belong to. And it's not just any old bit of paper.

51
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.460
What you put in the ethnicity box can have very, very real consequences.

52
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.310
For example, in the Xinjiang autonomous region,

53
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.660
the only one in which the ego population predominates the authorities have

54
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:30.220
collected images, fingerprints,

55
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.230
Iris captures DNA and biometric data from each and every resident of the

56
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:38.440
region since 2017. And if you're a resident of Xinjiang,

57
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.890
it's not like you've been asked for your consent or that you can refuse to give

58
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:44.950
a DNA sample. If you do not participate in the regional database,

59
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.950
not only do you not have access to the most basic documentation,

60
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:50.110
but you can be charged with disloyalty to the room.

61
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.383
<v 3>Jean.</v>

62
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.080
<v 1>It happens. You're going to be forced to go through a re-education program,</v>

63
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.390
which in some cases basically means a concentration.

64
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.770
There are even several accusations of racism with many organizations comparing

65
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.490
China's treatment of the, your girls to the Nazis treatment of Jews.

66
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.210
And we're not talking about groups of dangerous neo-liberal capitalists who hate

67
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.750
to China,

68
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.740
but about organizations like human rights watch and the European parliament.

69
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:21.240
So is there really racism in China is racism really supported by the government

70
00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:24.180
itself? Why, who is the hardest hit today?

71
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.440
We're going to answer these questions,

72
00:04:25.441 --> 00:04:27.570
but first let's have a look at some history.

73
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.180
<v 3>Chosen, right?</v>

74
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.380
<v 1>You may be surprised to hear this,</v>

75
00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:38.580
but almost 30% of the Chinese population does not speak Mandarin Chinese.

76
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.340
When we think of China, we tend to think of a gigantic,

77
00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.390
super homogenous country where everyone is equal. They are all Chinese speak,

78
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.390
Mandarin Chinese and follow Chinese traditions. Well,

79
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.380
that is not the case at all.

80
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.440
Today's China is a country of almost 1.4 billion people.

81
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.270
It's a relatively young country,

82
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.240
at least in terms of its current borders and political system.

83
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.720
And there are whole regions that don't have Chinese culture or anything

84
00:05:00.721 --> 00:05:04.290
resembling it mainly to Tibet and the Xinjiang region

85
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.150
In these two regions,

86
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.500
it's the Han Chinese that are the minority race and almost the entire population

87
00:05:13.501 --> 00:05:15.360
speaks local languages. Just so you know,

88
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.060
there are more than 300 different languages in China.

89
00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.540
And we're talking about languages that sometimes are not even related to each

90
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:25.170
other. For example, the legal language does not even use Chinese characters,

91
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.370
but is an adaptation of the Arabic alphabet in Hong Kong. Cantonese has spoken,

92
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.830
which is not anything like Mandarin to give you an idea.

93
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.100
We're talking about languages as different from each other as Spanish or Brown.

94
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.173
<v 3>Sure.</v>

95
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.900
<v 1>This has been China's great obsession, not just from the time of communism,</v>

96
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.340
but since time immemorial,

97
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.150
the very first political attempts to centralize and unify China date back to the

98
00:05:48.151 --> 00:05:52.350
third century BC and collimated 200 years later during the Han empire.

99
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.370
<v 3>Agile, probably thinking who are the hunts.</v>

100
00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.840
<v 1>Behind are the typical Chinese.</v>

101
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:03.410
You imagine they have Chinese facial features speak Mandarin Chinese and

102
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:06.770
represent Chinese culture and tradition while they make up to 92% of the

103
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:07.490
population.

104
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.600
There are two regions where they are not the majority population in Tibet.

105
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.240
The hand make up only 8% of the population.

106
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.440
And in Jinjiang just over 38%, however, even in these regions,

107
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.360
the Han historically held the position. Yeah.

108
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:24.460
<v 0>For a time.</v>

109
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.120
<v 1>The balance between Chinese ethnicities and conquered peoples was more or less</v>

110
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.080
easy to maintain.

111
00:06:29.081 --> 00:06:32.620
China was a feudal country with a hierarchical political system in which

112
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.290
everyone had a clear idea of their social role.

113
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.040
Things changed in the 20th century, the Chinese sleeping dragon awoke,

114
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.940
and found a problem.

115
00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.900
How do we build a modern nation state with so many peoples that see us as

116
00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:47.830
invaders? The solution of the first president of the Republic of China was easy.

117
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.360
We are going to tell minorities that not only must we be friends,

118
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.260
but we must come from the same origin,

119
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.540
the Han empire of more than two millennia.

120
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.533
<v 0>Go.</v>

121
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.950
<v 1>This part of the story was rewritten by Chinese leaders as if they were writers</v>

122
00:07:02.951 --> 00:07:03.850
of a soap opera.

123
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.180
[inaudible] Well, there it is. John Paul,

124
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.580
we can't keep fighting because I just found out we're cousins.

125
00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:16.510
So what's the problem that this rhetoric apart from being historically false,

126
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.260
continued to place the hunt as the favorite sons in the great Chinese family.

127
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:20.890
Meanwhile,

128
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.190
minorities had to reinvent themselves to earn the affection of the mother

129
00:07:24.191 --> 00:07:27.970
Republic. Then Mao arrives and take stock of the situation.

130
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.330
He simplifies the Chinese characters to facilitate the learning of the common

131
00:07:31.331 --> 00:07:34.360
language and advances in the construction of a United people,

132
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.150
but as good a parents, he no longer has favorite children.

133
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.110
The idea of Han supremacy was extended to political and social levels,

134
00:07:41.111 --> 00:07:44.950
to such an extent that even the Chinese constitution itself recognizes Han

135
00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:46.540
chauvinism as a threat.

136
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.840
<v 2>In the struggle to safeguard the unity of the nationalities.</v>

137
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:57.850
It is necessary to combat big nation chauvinism, mainly Han chauvinism,

138
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:02.500
and to combat local national chauvinism extract from the preamble of the Chinese

139
00:08:02.501 --> 00:08:03.190
constitution.

140
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:06.670
<v 1>While the Han were off the pedestal, the constitution recognized some cultural,</v>

141
00:08:06.671 --> 00:08:09.490
social and linguistic rights of ethnic minorities.

142
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.880
And in some cases they might even seem like privileges. For example,

143
00:08:12.881 --> 00:08:15.790
while the Han Chinese had to comply with the one child policy,

144
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.970
minorities could have two or even three children. And you're probably thinking,

145
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.230
so why are they complaining?

146
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.380
Well as always the devil is in the details as we'll see right now.

147
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.540
<v 0>No country for hipsters.</v>

148
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:31.930
<v 1>In recent years, it has become fashionable to wear a beard. However,</v>

149
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:36.700
if I were an oil girl lived in Jean Jang and wore a beard, I would have a huge,

150
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:37.930
huge problem. Why?

151
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.100
Because it would be red as an indication that I'm most likely a radical

152
00:08:42.101 --> 00:08:44.440
extremist. At least that's what the Beijing government.

153
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.273
<v 0>Thinks.</v>

154
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.350
<v 2>China Wiggers detained for beards, veils and internet Brown.</v>

155
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.570
<v 1>And then you have it. We're not only talking about beards,</v>

156
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.740
but also about a woman who covers her head, a person practices,

157
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:58.500
religious rights or someone who visits foreign websites.

158
00:08:58.530 --> 00:08:59.580
But that is at the end of it.

159
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.730
You can also be arrested for visiting relatives outside to China,

160
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.500
or even for buying food with a HELOC.

161
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.353
<v 3>Label.</v>

162
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:07.530
<v 1>As you can see,</v>

163
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.950
most of these restrictions are somehow associated with Islam and they are

164
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:14.850
designed precisely to reduce the importance of this religion in Chinese society.

165
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:16.980
And you'll say, but surely you're making it up. Josh,

166
00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:20.010
you're telling us this because you're buying into America's neo-liberal

167
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:20.880
propaganda. Well,

168
00:09:20.881 --> 00:09:24.990
the truth is that what I'm telling you is actually the official rhetoric's in

169
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:28.860
Beijing. In fact, the Chinese communist party justifies their actions like this.

170
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.713
<v 3>Yes.</v>

171
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.650
<v 2>And Western Xinjiang region has written vocational training centers for Muslim</v>

172
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:37.850
Wiggers into law,

173
00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:41.390
a mid growing international concern over large-scale disappearances.

174
00:09:41.391 --> 00:09:45.710
There is a young says the centers will tackle extremism through thought

175
00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:46.700
transformation.

176
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.810
<v 1>[Inaudible] transformation may sound like something from 1984, but don't forget.</v>

177
00:09:50.811 --> 00:09:52.250
We're talking about a dictatorship,

178
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.060
many things that are considered unacceptable in a democratic society are

179
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.450
commonplace in China. And you're probably wondering, but how did that happen?

180
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.840
Didn't you just say that China accepted diversity and recognize the cultural

181
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.480
linguistic and religious rights of these minorities? Well,

182
00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:08.180
let's go back a moment in time and return to the constitution.

183
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:12.530
On one hand in 1982 constitution recognizes ethnic diversity,

184
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.710
the rights of minorities and the right of all citizens to profess their

185
00:10:15.711 --> 00:10:17.270
religious beliefs. But on the other hand,

186
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.490
it is expressly forbidden to use religion,

187
00:10:19.491 --> 00:10:22.220
to threaten unity among Chinese nationalities.

188
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.430
And this is something that in practice can mean anything. For example,

189
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.890
you can shout long, lived China and nothing happens.

190
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.900
But if you shouted long-lived Tibet,

191
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.620
you would be guaranteed at least one unforgettable night to behind bars.

192
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.700
In fact, the regime prohibits any kind of nationalist movements. What's more,

193
00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:41.150
there are even legal changes that contradict the constitution itself.

194
00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:41.840
For example,

195
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.710
even if minorities have the rights on the paper to receive education in their

196
00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:47.600
own languages. In recent years,

197
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.440
there were decrees that teaching in some regions should only be undertaken in

198
00:10:51.441 --> 00:10:52.520
Mandarin Chinese.

199
00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.090
And let's see who dares to denounce the Chinese government in the courts here.

200
00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.300
However, we go far beyond political and linguistic rights.

201
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.040
It's about to get a lot darker.

202
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:01.993
<v 3>Listen up.</v>

203
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.570
<v 2>Scientists, debate China's law on sterilizing, the carriers of genetic defects.</v>

204
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.760
<v 1>We've all heard about the one child policy.</v>

205
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.030
It was enforced between 1979 and 2015.

206
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:17.660
What is not so well known is that there is also a law that forces certain

207
00:11:17.661 --> 00:11:21.080
couples to abort, potential offspring, or even be sterilized.

208
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:25.310
Initially the maternal child health act of 1994 is based on a brutal

209
00:11:25.311 --> 00:11:26.600
interpretation of public health.

210
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.880
Basically if a couple has any kind of inherited physical or mental illness and

211
00:11:34.881 --> 00:11:37.310
not allowed to reproduce. So in order to get married,

212
00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.320
you have to prove that you have been sterilized.

213
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.320
The same law also speaks of defective fetuses in which case,

214
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:44.690
termination of the pregnancy is recommended.

215
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.720
And I'm guessing you can probably imagine what recommendations are like in the

216
00:11:47.721 --> 00:11:51.680
Chinese regime by now. Some of you will be thinking that this all can't be true,

217
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.630
but think about it. We're talking about a very non individualistic country.

218
00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:00.220
That is a place where it is understood that citizens are indebted above all to

219
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.700
the collective good under this logic. Many of these things are consistent,

220
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.890
consistent in a strange way. Yes,

221
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.590
but no one can say that China isn't true to itself,

222
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.760
but let's get back to the topic of racism because if sterilization seem barbaric

223
00:12:12.761 --> 00:12:13.180
to you,

224
00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.600
look at this quote from the former Chinese public health minister speaking in

225
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.460
1990.

226
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.293
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

227
00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:25.320
<v 2>Or quality births are important among ancient revolutionary basis among ethnic</v>

228
00:12:25.321 --> 00:12:29.760
minorities in border areas. And in economically marginalized areas,

229
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.210
Chen min Jong minister of public health in 1994.

230
00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:38.730
<v 1>There are ethnic minorities that produced lower quality births in practice.</v>

231
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.210
This means that it is ethnic minorities who suffer most of the forced

232
00:12:42.211 --> 00:12:43.920
sterilizations. For example,

233
00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:47.130
while the law technically allows to veterans to have more than one child,

234
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.800
it also forced many couples of this race to be sterilized.

235
00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:53.310
There have been many cases where women were sterilized without even knowing what

236
00:12:53.311 --> 00:12:55.230
operation they were being subjected to.

237
00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.480
And we're not just talking about isolated cases here,

238
00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:01.530
according to a university of Michigan paper and 1995,

239
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.760
more than 3% of Tibetan women would have undergone these operations.

240
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.180
If you think this is a horrific state of affairs, you've not seen anything yet.

241
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.790
<v 2>This country, we speak Chinese.</v>

242
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.890
<v 1>As we have explained several times on this channel,</v>

243
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:21.660
Jingping is a reversal in everything that is to do with Chinese openness while

244
00:13:21.661 --> 00:13:23.430
it is true that in many respects,

245
00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:27.600
China was opening itself more to the world and recognizing citizens rights.

246
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:31.650
If only economically Xi Jinping came up with a very clear idea about the legal

247
00:13:31.651 --> 00:13:34.470
status of ethnic minorities. What did he do?

248
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:37.140
Something which might initially seem to be good news.

249
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:38.640
He abolished the one child policy.

250
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.820
<v 2>Trying to end one child policy, allowing families to have two children.</v>

251
00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.850
<v 1>This means that the hand could automatically have more than one child.</v>

252
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:49.110
But what about minorities?

253
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.860
Do you remember Danielle Ping's famous phrase that it didn't matter if the cat

254
00:13:52.861 --> 00:13:56.700
was black or white while hunting mice well, Gigi pink doesn't care anymore.

255
00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.330
What the Chinese president is looking for is precisely what's the preamble to

256
00:14:00.331 --> 00:14:04.230
his constitution for bids to standardize the country under the dominance of hand

257
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.590
culture. This term was a major setback for ethnic minorities,

258
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.950
where before the maternal and child health act of 1994,

259
00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:13.980
pay for the way for the sterilization of some minority people,

260
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.220
jeez government began to apply eugenic policies across the board.

261
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.350
And the most effected group have been the audience.

262
00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:23.250
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

263
00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:27.600
<v 2>China cuts weaker births with [inaudible] abortion and sterilization.</v>

264
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:29.520
<v 1>But it's not just that. If you remember,</v>

265
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:33.840
GJ ping uses super nationalist rhetoric for him, unity is very important.

266
00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:37.080
And when we talk about Chinese nationalism, what we mean is this.

267
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:42.330
<v 2>Religions must be subordinate to communist party.</v>

268
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:46.500
<v 1>And what does all this mean that Chinese communists will tolerate religion as</v>

269
00:14:46.501 --> 00:14:48.570
long as they get to choose the religious leaders.

270
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.310
We have seen it with the Catholic church,

271
00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.990
which was the bid in China until Pope Francis made a pact with Gigi pink.

272
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.920
Basically China accepted the authority of the Vatican in exchange for diplomatic

273
00:14:57.921 --> 00:15:01.010
favors, but other religious minorities have not been so lucky.

274
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.480
And that's the case with the way girls,

275
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.230
the autonomous region of Xinjiang is the only place in China where [inaudible]

276
00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.720
ethnicity predominance. And as you know,

277
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.260
the main difference between oysters and the Han Chinese is that the girls are

278
00:15:12.261 --> 00:15:14.180
mostly Muslim and use Arabic script.

279
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:24.490
The patient government is willing to do anything to erase these differences.

280
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:27.100
And you'll say, how would they go about doing this? Well,

281
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.960
among other things through education in 2017 for language teaching was banned in

282
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:34.540
all schools in Jing Jang. And two years later,

283
00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:37.180
the use of the Arabic alphabet in public spaces was bad.

284
00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.540
Of course looked at from the outside, from the Western perspective,

285
00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:43.060
we could easily call this cultural genocide,

286
00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:46.120
but the Chinese government doesn't believe that he's doing anything wrong.

287
00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.480
The way they see it. These laws are helping oysters integrate.

288
00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:50.920
Think about it from this point of view,

289
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.440
the official language in China is Mandarin Chinese.

290
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.510
If you want to integrate into Chinese society,

291
00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.060
increase your job opportunities and live the Chinese dream.

292
00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.670
The first thing you have to do is learn the official language.

293
00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.380
Does it make some sense? It does, right?

294
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.810
At first it might even seem like good politics.

295
00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.590
China is using every means at its disposal. So that oil goes,

296
00:16:08.591 --> 00:16:11.770
can become Han Chinese, fully fledged Chinese. I mean,

297
00:16:11.771 --> 00:16:14.110
it's not just a racial issue. They're saying, okay,

298
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.420
you want to be part of the Chinese dream. No problem.

299
00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:18.640
We're going to teach you Chinese. So what's the problem.

300
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.240
The problem is in the methods being used to motivate, or it goes to integrate.

301
00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:29.200
<v 3>Chairman report spells out China human rights abuses against a weaker Muslims.</v>

302
00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.680
<v 1>These human rights violations occur in some very specific places,</v>

303
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:34.870
which Beijing calls reeducation camps.

304
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:38.620
It is estimated that there are at least 500 in the Jinjiang region.

305
00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:40.360
So what exactly are they for? Well,

306
00:16:40.361 --> 00:16:44.110
as the name suggests to reeducate Muslim minorities and bring them culturally

307
00:16:44.111 --> 00:16:45.730
closer to the Han ethnic group,

308
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.510
these are supposedly vocational training centers and the official photos looked

309
00:16:49.511 --> 00:16:50.590
like language Academy.

310
00:16:50.591 --> 00:16:53.890
Textbook covers a lot of happy young students smiling at the camera.

311
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.280
And the question is, do you think girls are happy in these camps? Well,

312
00:16:57.281 --> 00:17:00.850
the truth is no. And reeducation is nothing like a voluntary process.

313
00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:06.780
<v 3>[Inaudible] proof of this is that.</v>

314
00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:10.570
<v 1>In many of these centers, there are entire arsenals of tear, gas, stun,</v>

315
00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:12.760
guns and handcuffs. And I don't know about you,

316
00:17:12.761 --> 00:17:16.000
but it's hard for me to understand how you can educate with those things.

317
00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.180
And of course, oil goes who have managed to escape. Reeducation camps,

318
00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.810
denounced them as dens of torture abuse of all kinds of violence,

319
00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.210
but it's not just about what's going on behind locked Gates.

320
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:26.410
As I told you at the beginning,

321
00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:30.400
Xinjiang residents are required to provide a series of biometric data to

322
00:17:30.401 --> 00:17:33.070
authorities from fingerprints to DNA samples,

323
00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.370
something that does not happen to the same degree in the rest of the country.

324
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:37.000
What's more,

325
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.570
China is increasingly successful in developing and implementing facial

326
00:17:40.571 --> 00:17:41.800
recognition technology.

327
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:45.790
So any Iger can be recognized within seconds wherever they are. And you'll say,

328
00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:50.070
but where is the racist bias if this technology is implemented in China? Well,

329
00:17:50.071 --> 00:17:50.311
yes,

330
00:17:50.311 --> 00:17:54.000
that's a good point until you discover that 30% of the trials were conducted

331
00:17:54.001 --> 00:17:57.210
specifically by analyzing Olga facial features.

332
00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:01.230
All of this is worrying when you consider that goes account for only 0.7,

333
00:18:01.231 --> 00:18:04.530
6% of the total Chinese population at this point,

334
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.100
many of you will think that it simply can't be true. He must be making this up.

335
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.520
And you might think that except for the fact that China actually justifies these

336
00:18:11.521 --> 00:18:12.354
policies.

337
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.220
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

338
00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.670
<v 1>The Chinese government typically uses three arguments to explain defending their</v>

339
00:18:19.671 --> 00:18:21.950
actions, reason. Number one, it's our country.

340
00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.210
Don't interfere in what we do too.

341
00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:26.810
We're trying to prevent Islamic terrorism because oil goes are Muslims and

342
00:18:26.811 --> 00:18:28.250
therefore could be radicalized.

343
00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:30.560
And three we're helping minorities integrate better.

344
00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:33.950
That'd be part of China's great dream. We may have some way extreme methods,

345
00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.650
but we have their wellbeing at heart. However, as you can imagine,

346
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.290
oil goes and Tibetans just don't agree with this.

347
00:18:39.291 --> 00:18:42.200
It is no surprise that oil and to better nationalist movements,

348
00:18:42.201 --> 00:18:45.380
increasingly echo each other in the telling of their story.

349
00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:49.900
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

350
00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.450
<v 2>We hear exiles push for court case, accusing China of.</v>

351
00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:56.660
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

352
00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:01.100
<v 2>Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Tibet, you and experts denounce Beijing's crack.</v>

353
00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:06.590
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

354
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:07.790
<v 1>So now the question is over to you.</v>

355
00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.070
Did you know about these cases of Chinese racism?

356
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.460
Do you think China will be successful in imposing unity throughout the country?

357
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:17.360

358
00:19:17.361 --> 00:19:19.550
