00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.310
<v 0>A new video made in conjunction with value school.</v>

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.080
And I don't think it's going to leave you in different.

3
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:10.723
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.040
<v 0>Over the last decade, we have witnessed a complete technological revolution.</v>

5
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.820
We have seen business models grow and consolidate in completely new areas,

6
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.660
smartphones via commerce, social media, and even video on demand platforms.

7
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.540
New Colossus is like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Alibaba, alphabet, Netflix,

8
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:31.820
or even Tesla have become the biggest stars in them.

9
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.910
<v 1>But.</v>

10
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.810
<v 0>Here's a question for you.</v>

11
00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:39.290
Can you tell me which listed company has achieved the greatest increase over the

12
00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:40.300
last decade? Well,

13
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.130
take a look at this because it's not any of the companies that I've just

14
00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:46.400
mentioned, and it has nothing to do with the NASDAQ or new technologies.

15
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.500
According to data from Bloomberg. If we consider MSEI world index companies,

16
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.930
that is an index that brings together medium and large capital companies in

17
00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:54.800
developed countries,

18
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.760
the best performing company in the stock market is none other than a New Zealand

19
00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:02.360
company in the dairy sector. Yes, we have stumbled upon the Kiwis.

20
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.350
Wait talking about a two milk and note that the difference is really good.

21
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.243
<v 1>Great.</v>

22
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.030
[inaudible].

23
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.770
<v 0>Hey, two milk is a fairly young company created in 2000, between 2010 and 2019.</v>

24
00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:23.840
It has achieved an increase in the stock exchange.

25
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.640
Are you ready for this really crazy figure of more than 16000%,

26
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.630
which is an annual return of just over 66% for an entire year.

27
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.643
<v 1>Decade.</v>

28
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.090
<v 0>It's not all over the past five years.</v>

29
00:01:38.091 --> 00:01:42.530
The annual profitability of its shareholders has been even higher between 2015

30
00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:43.430
and 2019.

31
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.930
This stock has average an annual return of almost 80% in this period alone.

32
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.980
The price of its share has gone from about 95 cents in 2015 to closing at a

33
00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:54.350
price of almost $18 in 2019.

34
00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.150
What's more even the Corona virus.

35
00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:01.550
Hasn't made a dent in it since the beginning of the year.

36
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:05.600
And until the end of July, this company has reaped an increase of almost 40%.

37
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.970
<v 1>In other.</v>

38
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.010
<v 0>Words, if in the summer of 2015,</v>

39
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:14.720
we decided to invest 10,000 pounds in this New Zealand dairy company today just

40
00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:15.800
five and a half years later,

41
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.440
the shares would be worth more than a quarter of a million.

42
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.630
<v 1>Dollars. And.</v>

43
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.530
<v 0>If, instead of waiting until 2015, we had carried out the investment earlier,</v>

44
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.760
let's say 2010.

45
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.450
Then we would be talking about a jackpot of more than $2 million,

46
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.430
specifically about $2,727,000

47
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.450
to be more accurate.

48
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.920
It's sheer madness that has made a small New Zealand company become in just 10

49
00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:43.100
years, a food giant valued at almost $10 billion.

50
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.160
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

51
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.010
<v 0>Do you know what the best thing of all is that this company doesn't even have?</v>

52
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.780
What explains such a rapid rise?

53
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.900
Are we dealing with some kind of rampant bubble in the dairy sector?

54
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.390
How has this company achieved such success in such a basic and at the same time,

55
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:03.280
highly saturated market? Well.

56
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.470
<v 1>Let's take a look, a different protein.</v>

57
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.243
You get to the beginning of this.

58
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.800
<v 0>We have to go back to before the turn of the century,</v>

59
00:03:13.801 --> 00:03:18.480
back to the year 1993 that's year two Kiwis to New Zealand scientists,

60
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.170
Bob Elliott,

61
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.580
and Karen McLachlan who were researching diabetes and heart disease identified

62
00:03:23.581 --> 00:03:24.450
milk as a possible.

63
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:25.463
<v 1>Bridge.</v>

64
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.310
<v 0>Not all types of milk, but specifically the variety known as a one,</v>

65
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.730
which is the type of milk that is marketed in virtually every country in the

66
00:03:35.731 --> 00:03:36.564
world.

67
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.000
<v 1>Well.</v>

68
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.571
<v 0>So their research,</v>

69
00:03:39.571 --> 00:03:43.290
this type of milk was identified as possibly leading to inflammatory processes

70
00:03:43.291 --> 00:03:44.430
in the digestive system,

71
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.960
a problem experienced by approximately 25% of the population at the same time,

72
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.190
they also indicated that another type of milk known as a tube may not have these

73
00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:54.090
harmful effects.

74
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:56.490
<v 1>To clarify.</v>

75
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.890
<v 0>Let's explain what these two types are. You see,</v>

76
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.410
we can say that all milk contains two types of protein,

77
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.670
18% corresponding to that part known as whey protein and the remaining 82% to

78
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.080
casein in turn, we can find three types of casein, alpha beta and Kappa. Well,

79
00:04:10.081 --> 00:04:14.190
the beta casein can be either type a one or type a two in the past.

80
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.380
Cows produced only the two proteins,

81
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.560
but apparently from a cell mutation that occurred about a hundred thousand years

82
00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:23.130
ago in Europe, cows began producing the [inaudible] beta casein protein.

83
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.040
These cows can produce more milk, making the, a one type cattle,

84
00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:27.810
the favorites of farmers throughout the world.

85
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.880
<v 1>Since.</v>

86
00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.690
<v 0>Then studies on this issue have multiplied with results for all tastes. Yes,</v>

87
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.690
a one type milk really has problems. No, it doesn't have them.

88
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.510
Then a two milk is better than it's not et cetera, et cetera,

89
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.800
as you can probably imagine,

90
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.830
the conclusions have usually had a lot to do with those who sponsored the

91
00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:45.630
studies. However, at this point in time,

92
00:04:45.631 --> 00:04:48.780
it seems that the majority of scientific opinions suggest that this alleged

93
00:04:48.781 --> 00:04:50.610
damage from type Awan milk is.

94
00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.013
<v 1>Prove it.</v>

95
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.020
<v 0>For example, what the European food safety or authority points do,</v>

96
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.040
but let's stop the scientific debate. The fact is that in 2000 Koren McLachlan,

97
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.050
one of the two New Zealand scientists,

98
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.440
we mentioned earlier partnered with entrepreneur Howard Patterson to found the

99
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.520
[inaudible] milk company with the aim of distributing milk and a two type dairy

100
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.653
product.

101
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.890
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

102
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:15.600
<v 0>And you know what,</v>

103
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.660
beyond the debate about whether a two type milk is actually better or not,

104
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.750
the truth is that this company has effectively used the marketing of this

105
00:05:21.751 --> 00:05:24.450
different type of milk to consolidate a premium brand.

106
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.960
Something that along with the perception, that it may be easier to digest,

107
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.350
allow them to multiply sales in New Zealand, Australia, and all syringe.

108
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.840
When they released their infant formula,

109
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.200
a product that has had spectacular results in the Chinese market.

110
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.470
It's a country where families are particularly concerned about the quality of

111
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.030
milk consumed by the youngest,

112
00:05:48.031 --> 00:05:51.510
especially after the countries 2008 contaminated milk crisis,

113
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.350
which caused more than 50,000 newborn children to be hospitalized.

114
00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.760
<v 1>And.</v>

115
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.820
<v 0>It's here where this New Zealand company has found a way to break through,</v>

116
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:05.660
because let's say that a two milk didn't want to be a typical milk distribution

117
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:09.710
company, but that its goal has been to become a complete marketing company. Yes.

118
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.610
Marketing. And that that's exactly what explains it. Stock market performance.

119
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.950
<v 1>Listen up a business success.</v>

120
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.230
<v 0>16000% Up. Are we dealing with a bubble? Well,</v>

121
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.700
more like a spectacular growth story in the last five years alone,

122
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:31.750
the company has managed to multiply its sales by almost 12 times. And in 2020,

123
00:06:31.751 --> 00:06:34.630
they expect a further increase of more than 30%.

124
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:37.630
<v 1>And it's not just.</v>

125
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.580
<v 0>About income and increased operating profits.</v>

126
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.060
Hasn't been slow in happening either the projections for the company's interest

127
00:06:43.061 --> 00:06:45.760
in pre-tax profits expected by the end of 2020, uh,

128
00:06:45.761 --> 00:06:48.880
greater than the company's entire market value was in 2015.

129
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.953
<v 1>Eight.</v>

130
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.240
<v 0>It's a company that has so far been operating in New Zealand, Australia,</v>

131
00:06:55.241 --> 00:06:57.850
and China, but which has just taken on the giant UBS.

132
00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.073
<v 1>Smack it.</v>

133
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:01.840
<v 0>But at this point,</v>

134
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.160
the burning question is how has this small company achieved such success?

135
00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.900
What makes this business tick? Well,

136
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.320
you see the most surprising thing about it is that Adrian milk is not really a

137
00:07:11.321 --> 00:07:12.700
food producer. That is,

138
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.600
it is a very unusual dairy company because all of its products are manufactured

139
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.160
by third party suppliers,

140
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.910
suppliers with which the company maintained strong ties as is the case with

141
00:07:21.911 --> 00:07:22.720
scintillate milk,

142
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.130
a New Zealand dairy company that lists a two milk is its second largest

143
00:07:27.131 --> 00:07:29.270
shareholder controlling 20% of.

144
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.213
<v 1>The shares.</v>

145
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.220
<v 0>Are we still talking about third party companies, as we told you before,</v>

146
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.220
82 milk is basically a distribution and marketing business.

147
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.200
The goal of its managers is to feed demand,

148
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.080
take care of the distribution chain and strengthen its brand image.

149
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.840
And this has really important advantages. For example,

150
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:49.120
they don't need to invest in capital. It may be surprising,

151
00:07:49.121 --> 00:07:50.350
but over the past five years,

152
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.490
a two milk has managed to increase its annual sales by more than 1.5 billion,

153
00:07:54.491 --> 00:07:58.570
New Zealand dollars by investing in fixed capital totalling just $9 million.

154
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:01.120
Yes, yes, that's correct.

155
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:05.710
Just 9 million New Zealand dollars about us $6 billion in the current exchange

156
00:08:05.711 --> 00:08:06.790
rates in this way,

157
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.630
the company not only does not need large lines of credit or to assume large debt

158
00:08:10.631 --> 00:08:13.600
commitments, but also the bulk of the profits. It generates are in cash.

159
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.823
<v 1>Cash.</v>

160
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.320
<v 0>Thanks to the fact that it does not have to make huge investments in fixed</v>

161
00:08:20.321 --> 00:08:22.570
capital and face. All the associated costs.

162
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.570
The company achieves an operating margin of more than 30%.

163
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.630
That is at the same level as the big technology companies in the union.

164
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:31.740
<v 1>Basically.</v>

165
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:35.080
<v 0>The only task of managers is to take care of the brand, develop markets,</v>

166
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.590
design marketing campaigns, and look for new ways to fuel demand. For example,

167
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.250
one of the keys to its growth in China was that the company was a pioneer among

168
00:08:42.251 --> 00:08:46.600
food companies and exploiting the power of e-commerce for example, via Alibaba.

169
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.690
<v 1>Anyway.</v>

170
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.690
<v 0>It was the strategy and the spectacular growth that its business has recorded is</v>

171
00:08:52.691 --> 00:08:56.160
what explains the incredible increase that this company had on the stock

172
00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:58.860
exchange. However, even having all the available numbers,

173
00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:02.640
if you think that its stock market evaluation has been a quiet riot,

174
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.990
you couldn't be more wrong.

175
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:06.720
<v 1>During.</v>

176
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.950
<v 0>The last five years alone,</v>

177
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.610
we can see in the evolution of the stock price that on three occasions,

178
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:14.100
the share price plummeted more than 30%.

179
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.850
Can you imagine being a shareholder and selling your shares for fear of failing,

180
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.610
even if the business was going so very well, it would have been hard.

181
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.980
<v 1>16000%.</v>

182
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.960
<v 0>Take note though, because something similar happens to the format,</v>

183
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.350
a two milk shareholder, the Australian company, freedom foods.

184
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.630
This company had 20% of the shares. However,

185
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.390
after a frustrated attempt to take over the entire company,

186
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:40.040
it decided to liquidate its entire stake in 2015 for just over 60 million

187
00:09:40.041 --> 00:09:41.930
euros. The day just five years later,

188
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.810
that same stake would be worth more than $2 billion,

189
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.260
which is more than the entire market capitalization of the freedom foods

190
00:09:48.261 --> 00:09:51.350
company. So, you know, be very careful in selling a good business to soon.

191
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:54.380
<v 1>Anyway.</v>

192
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.213
<v 0>This is the story of a,</v>

193
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.850
to milk the company with the best stock market performance of the last decade.

194
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.690
A company that is dedicated to a business as traditional as milk has managed to

195
00:10:02.691 --> 00:10:06.350
exceed the profitability generated by Silicon Valley's largest companies.
