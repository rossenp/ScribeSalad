<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.850
<v 1>I'm going to ask you a question and please be honest.</v>

3
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.530
Have you ever heard of Oman?

4
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.410
You probably know that it is an oil rich country in the middle East,

5
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.010
but have you ever seen a story about it on the news? Cause I bet you haven't.

6
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.160
And this is surprising given that there was a huge news event for this country

7
00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:24.350
at the beginning of 2020 checklists.

8
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.920
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

9
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.910
<v 2>Amman Sultan Qaboos spin site has died. State media reports,</v>

10
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.130
the associated press 2020, the CELTA.

11
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.620
<v 1>Had been ruling this country for more than 50 years.</v>

12
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.810
And given that this country as an absolute monarchy,

13
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.930
the death of the Sultan spells a complete political change,

14
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.780
but that is not all the new Sultan he found.

15
00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:48.710
Ben Tariq has inherited a country that was destined to be in the news all the

16
00:00:48.711 --> 00:00:51.470
time. Have you ever heard of the Strait of Hormuz?

17
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.040
This is one of the most important waterways in the world at shipping lane is

18
00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:56.660
only three kilometers white. Yeah.

19
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.860
Every day over 18 million barrels of oil pass through it from the East to the

20
00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:01.694
West.

21
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.800
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

22
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.230
<v 1>How about one third of all the oil transported by sea travels through this</v>

23
00:01:09.231 --> 00:01:11.990
passage, this street is guarded by two countries,

24
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.340
Iran and Aman guarding it as a huge responsibility.

25
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.580
And now combine that fact with the knowledge that on the other side of the

26
00:01:19.581 --> 00:01:20.870
street is Iran,

27
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.890
a rising regional power antagonistic to the West and looming on Oman's Northern

28
00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:28.610
border is Saudi Arabia, the other pro Western regional power. Oh,

29
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.630
and they also share a border with Yemen, a country embroiled in a civil war.

30
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.200
This makes for a highly volatile situation and which stuff.

31
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.130
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

32
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.630
<v 2>Iran, seizes, British tanker in Strait of Hormuz as tensions Mount France,</v>

33
00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:46.040
24, 2019.

34
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.701
<v 1>At this point,</v>

35
00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:50.270
I'm sure many of you are surprised that hardly anyone could name omens capital

36
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.650
by the way, it's Muscat,

37
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.250
but let's leave geography aside for a minute because we haven't seen the whole

38
00:01:55.251 --> 00:01:58.730
picture or man's political system just like its neighbors,

39
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.270
religion and politics are very closely related and Oman,

40
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.700
despite being surrounded by extreme theocracies,

41
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.350
Oman is surprisingly modern and tolerant, for example, whereas in Saudi Arabia,

42
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.831
policemen,

43
00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:14.270
let girls burn to death in a school fire to avoid them breaking local law.

44
00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:17.120
By being outside with insufficient covering in, or man,

45
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.280
it is actually not allowed for women to wear an,

46
00:02:19.281 --> 00:02:23.600
a Cabot while working in professional institutes or driving and Oman women

47
00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:27.170
received the right to vote along with everyone else in 2002,

48
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.460
while in Saudi Arabia,

49
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.350
women gained the right to vote long after their male counterparts in 2015.

50
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.000
So despite all of this Oman is still completely under the radar and this is not

51
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:38.834
by chance.

52
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.640
Previous Salton went to great lengths to make sure his country would maintain

53
00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:48.350
friendly ties with everyone.

54
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.290
So a man has managed to stay away from any conflict.

55
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.920
In a way we could say is the Switzerland of the Saudi peninsula,

56
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.880
except that they are not as rich. In fact, Oman is just a middle income country,

57
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.230
which makes them the second poorest country and this oil rich region.

58
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.130
So now the question is what challenges will a new Salton face?

59
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.360
What is going on in this country? How can it be such an important enclave yet?

60
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:13.120
We almost never hear anything about it today.

61
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.320
We are going to answer all of these questions, but before we do, as always,

62
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.550
let's look at some history.

63
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.250
<v 0>The.</v>

64
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.080
<v 2>Fifth wheel of Islam.</v>

65
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.970
<v 1>Let's discuss middle Eastern politics.</v>

66
00:03:26.971 --> 00:03:29.670
You must first understand its religious divides. You see,

67
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.930
there are two major branches of Islam. The most popular goal is Sunni Islam,

68
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.870
almost all the Muslim majority nations belong to this brunch.

69
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.430
Then we have Shia Islam, which makes up the majority in four countries, Iran,

70
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.250
Iraq, Azerbaijan, and Bahrain. As you knew,

71
00:03:44.251 --> 00:03:48.120
the relations between Sunni Islam and Shia Islam are far from friendly.

72
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.630
The cold war between Saudi Arabia and Iran is rooted in this religious.

73
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.523
<v 0>Rivalry.</v>

74
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.620
<v 1>There is one nation that is neither Shia nor Sunni and yes,</v>

75
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.390
not nation is Oman. Oman's majority. Religion is known as I Buddhism.

76
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.270
This is important because you see Sunni's and she is,

77
00:04:09.271 --> 00:04:12.270
tend to view all others as heretics or infidels,

78
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.080
even resorting to killing each other on occasion. What's more Saudi Arabia.

79
00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.310
One of the regional powers is Sunni and Iran. Another power is Shia.

80
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.380
This creates another rift in the middle East,

81
00:04:22.381 --> 00:04:25.710
and I'll use these two powers to use religion as a tool to promote their

82
00:04:25.711 --> 00:04:28.200
interests. For example, around supporting the Shia,

83
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.220
who Thies and Yemen and Saudi Arabia supporting Sunni terrorists in Syria.

84
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.780
This is important because Oman's a body majority inoculates the countries from

85
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.910
either sides, extreme religious arguments,

86
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.690
also both Shia and Sunni Muslims believe that the Muslim world requires a

87
00:04:42.691 --> 00:04:44.280
central authority. Thus,

88
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.950
they want to expand their religious influence worldwide.

89
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.420
I Buddhism in contrast has no expansionist belief that gives omen a level of

90
00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:54.240
political protection from the wider conflict. Additionally,

91
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.110
Oman can be defined by two major doctrines conservatism and.

92
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.940
<v 0>British.</v>

93
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.080
<v 2>The servers of Omani rule in East Africa commented that it bodies were the least</v>

94
00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:11.160
fanatic and sectarian of all Muslims and openly associated with people of all

95
00:05:11.161 --> 00:05:13.620
faiths and pray together with Sunni Muslims.

96
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.650
Hostile action is reserved for one type of person,

97
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.270
the unjust ruler who refuses to mend his ways or relinquish his power.

98
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.990
Valerie Hoffman, professor of Islamic studies, university of Illinois.

99
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.440
<v 1>Many Sunni's who take a convert or dying approach. It.</v>

100
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.970
Bodies are unlikely to attack those who they view as Kfar or sinners for instead

101
00:05:32.971 --> 00:05:36.060
to take a stance of ostracization and social isolation.

102
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.080
This is definitely a long way from being completely tolerant and open-minded,

103
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.500
but still it is better to be ostracized than killed.

104
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.880
So I know what you're thinking.

105
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.230
We said the eye Buddism is defined by tolerance as well as conservatism.

106
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.040
How is it possible to mix those two? Make no mistake.

107
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.770
Oman is not aggressive towards non-believers,

108
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.240
but that doesn't mean they have been particularly modern. In fact,

109
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.890
during most of the 20th century,

110
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.490
Oman has been the most backward country in the whole Arabian peninsula.

111
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.220
They were so attached to tradition that for a long time,

112
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.180
modern things like umbrellas and sunglasses were forbidden.

113
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.370
How is that possible? Let's take a look.

114
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.410
<v 0>Better late than.</v>

115
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.040
<v 1>Never in 1932. So he'd been timer inherited the Sultan,</v>

116
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.490
Nate of Muscat and Oman as the country was known at that time. Now,

117
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:25.840
when timer was younger,

118
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.310
his father made sure new un-Islamic ideas would influence his education or

119
00:06:30.311 --> 00:06:31.090
philosophy.

120
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.020
His father was successful and that he created someone who was a very traditional

121
00:06:35.021 --> 00:06:36.790
and conservative Muslim. In fact.

122
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:37.960
<v 0>Maybe two.</v>

123
00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.500
<v 1>That's me for one moment. As I list some of the things that he band music,</v>

124
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.180
movies, singing, dancing, photography, newspapers, electricity, flashlights,

125
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.720
umbrellas, and Western dress, including the sunglasses. Yes,

126
00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:56.950
you heard that correctly.

127
00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.540
And one of the sunniest places on earth sunglasses were forbidden.

128
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.500
Even writing bicycles required a permit and anyone wanting to travel abroad had

129
00:07:05.501 --> 00:07:09.100
to obtain the Sultan's personal permission regarding bad health habits.

130
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:13.510
Oman had a hardcore take as well. Smoking was punishable by flogging.

131
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.730
That's another country that I could never go to.

132
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.970
Another reason this country stayed locked in its traditions is the oil wasn't

133
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.100
found in, or man until 1962 is almost 25 years after Saudi Arabia.

134
00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:29.420
<v 0>All of this.</v>

135
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.980
<v 1>Explain why your man is still not as rich as its neighbors,</v>

136
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.430
but if all this weren't enough, the country has also suffered two,

137
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.210
several Wars in less than two decades. That's rape or man has injured,

138
00:07:40.211 --> 00:07:42.340
not one but two civil Wars.

139
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.760
I bet you are no wondering how it is possible that you've never heard of this

140
00:07:45.761 --> 00:07:50.170
country before. Right? Everything started back in 1951 that year,

141
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.270
all minded lost its British protectorate status,

142
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.130
making it a proper independent nation,

143
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.940
but the Brits were not willing to seek control of this country so easily.

144
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.100
Even if oil hadn't actually been discovered yet,

145
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.560
it was known that the country had undiscovered oil beds.

146
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:06.220
And this explains the UK is full support through the previous ultra conservative

147
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:07.263
cell phone.

148
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.950
But nevertheless allowed British petroleum alongside other oil companies to

149
00:08:14.951 --> 00:08:17.980
undertake exploration. This supports would be very important.

150
00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.290
Three years later in 1954,

151
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.400
some regions in the internal part of omen backed by Saudi Arabia and Egypt

152
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.730
rebelled against the CELTA. This is how the Jebel act our war

153
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.710
That lasted until 1959.

154
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.970
Of course the Sultan ultimately won the war with the support of the UK army,

155
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.490
but peace didn't last long in Oman,

156
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.800
four years after the first civil war had finished,

157
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.570
another one started this time.

158
00:08:43.571 --> 00:08:46.390
It was a Marxist rebellion in the South of the country. And this case,

159
00:08:46.391 --> 00:08:49.870
the Marxist rebels wanted Delphi, a Southern region to be independent.

160
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.650
They were banked by China, the USSR and the Arab socialist parties.

161
00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:58.640
This time,

162
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.140
the UK and Iran helped us all turn over money to defeat the insurgents. Yes,

163
00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:07.460
I did just say a run in the UK or fighting site by site in the same war.

164
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:11.570
Remember that this was the 1960s back then Iran was ruled by the shock of

165
00:09:11.571 --> 00:09:15.800
Perisher and was an ally of the West during this war more than 700 arena and

166
00:09:15.801 --> 00:09:18.020
soldiers died fighting the communists.

167
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.100
And this explains why Oman still maintains friendly ties with Iran today.

168
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.050
Also fun authoritarian facts.

169
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.410
The Sultan became paranoid during these rebellions and actually banned

170
00:09:27.411 --> 00:09:30.290
conversations lasting longer than 15 minutes.

171
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.610
<v 0>As you can imagine that you can't, wasn't really.</v>

172
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.320
<v 1>Supporting a leader like that.</v>

173
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.740
Putting aside the ethical dilemmas of supporting such an authoritarian ruler,

174
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.550
there was a pragmatic issue too. After all we're talking about with rents,

175
00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:50.420
supporting a fanatic who can't even maintain stability within his country is

176
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:55.100
bonnet for business. So in 1978, there was another uprising against the Sultan.

177
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:55.940
Only this time,

178
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.420
it was a bloodless coup d'etat supported by the British themselves.

179
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.840
So you could say, but the UK Poot side has been timer and to power.

180
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.210
And the UK got rid of them when they had enough.

181
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.570
His successor was the man that you see in this picture.

182
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:16.580
Robin has been Saeed was the son of the previous Sultan, but unlike his father,

183
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.230
he had a Western upbringing.

184
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.110
He was educated in the UK and had served in the British military.

185
00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.740
When he took over, he was only 29 years old under this new cell ton,

186
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.480
a brand new country will be born.

187
00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.930
He rolled back all of his father's absurd buns and the same year he took power.

188
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.520
He abolished slavery,

189
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.630
making Oman the second to last nation and the world to do so. I mean,

190
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:40.100
I guess it's better late than never. And now I know what you're thinking.

191
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.090
So which country was the last one? And the answer is more tenia.

192
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:49.220
The only abolish slavery in 1981, 1981,

193
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:50.600
but let's get back to our story.

194
00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:58.040
It was in such bad shape before the new Sultan that the infant mortality rate

195
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:03.050
was 75%. Malnutrition was widespread. There were only three schools.

196
00:11:03.051 --> 00:11:06.380
The literacy rate was 5% and there were only 10 kilometers,

197
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:10.040
a six miles of paved routes. Now 50 years later,

198
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.230
Oman as a totally different country,

199
00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.880
umbrellas and sunglasses are legal and homosexuality is only punishable by

200
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.570
three years in prison. I say only because by our standards,

201
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.620
that's actually a very progressive policy and that's not all women make up our

202
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:28.400
own one third of the workforce and apostasy isn't even technically illegal,

203
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:33.020
which again is nice considering literally every country surrounding omen

204
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:35.390
executes. Those who renounced religion onto that.

205
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:38.510
And the old man's literacy rate is now a healthy 95

206
00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.490
In economic terms,

207
00:11:43.491 --> 00:11:48.350
when the new Sultan came to power Oman's GDP per capita was $354 in

208
00:11:48.351 --> 00:11:52.310
today's money. Currently Oman's GDP is $16,400.

209
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.360
That's really about improvement. Although it's not really impressive.

210
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.370
If we compare it with the other Arab countries,

211
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.370
it's still a lot lower than the Saudis, $23,400 and way lower than guitars.

212
00:12:02.371 --> 00:12:06.760
$69,000 making Oman the second poorest country in the peninsula only beating

213
00:12:06.761 --> 00:12:08.290
Yemen and wealth. Of course,

214
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:11.920
this can be explained by the fact that Oman started his rags-to-riches tale much

215
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:13.690
later than the other Arab countries.

216
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.080
Generally speaking,

217
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.320
we can say that the new Sultan has been a reasonably good leader for this

218
00:12:20.321 --> 00:12:23.950
country, although it wasn't really hard to improve on what his father has done.

219
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.360
Now, the question is, what can we expect for from his son? Let's take a look.

220
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.100
<v 0>A Western friend in the East.</v>

221
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.820
<v 1>You may be forgiven for thinking that the United States and Saudi Arabia have</v>

222
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:42.330
always been allies, but this friendship hasn't always been that clear.

223
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.800
During most of the 20th century,

224
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:47.640
the Saudis were frenemies with a U S happily selling them oil,

225
00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:51.660
but also constantly clashing with America's greatest ally Israel and funding

226
00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.153
anti-Western terrorist organization.

227
00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.090
<v 0>In the meantime.</v>

228
00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.990
<v 1>Well, mine was happy to just be friends with the West. In fact,</v>

229
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.920
Oman was never at war with Israel and we're always on the cutting edge of Arab

230
00:13:04.921 --> 00:13:08.820
has really diplomacy even allowed the U S to put military bases on their soil

231
00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:09.960
before it became a trend.

232
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.440
And this way Oman is sort of the hipster of the Arab world,

233
00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.990
but it is not just the U S that Amanda's friendly with them.

234
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.440
<v 0>This Iran,</v>

235
00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:24.150
Oman stress expansion of bilateral ties, Meryl news agency,

236
00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.340
2020 that's right.

237
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:29.130
<v 1>Oman is actually one of the country's friendliest to run in the region.</v>

238
00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.980
Do you remember that Marxist guerrilla conflict from the 1960s,

239
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:35.730
the cell town continued to honor the memory of the 700 Iranian soldiers who died

240
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.070
in order to stabilize his country. Since then,

241
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.500
Oman has maintained a good relationship with a run.

242
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.900
Even after the revolution of 1979,

243
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.630
they have even performed some limited Naval military exercises.

244
00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:49.380
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

245
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.060
<v 1>But make no mistake.</v>

246
00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:56.010
This is not just a matter of loyalty or Munn knows where it stands on the map

247
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:59.430
they're located. And one of the most critical enclaves for world's trades,

248
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.270
they are neighbors with Saudi Arabia, but they are not far from Iran either.

249
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.650
So Oman cleverly follows a strategy of avoiding making enemies and test the

250
00:14:07.651 --> 00:14:12.600
policy of the enemy of my friend can still be my friend going as far as to

251
00:14:12.601 --> 00:14:15.520
keep close relations with both Iran and Iraq in the.

252
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:16.463
<v 0>I there Warren.</v>

253
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.910
<v 1>It's all parts of a cunning strategy. You see,</v>

254
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.720
Oman is a relatively small country and an incredibly important location,

255
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.090
surrounded by beggar and wealthier powers.

256
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:34.410
All of them would want to dominate women if it weren't for the fact that Oman

257
00:14:34.411 --> 00:14:38.190
makes sure it stays in everyone's good books. For example,

258
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.550
many Gulf States isolated Qatar in 2017,

259
00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.670
Qatar was also friendly with many groups, such as the Muslim brotherhood,

260
00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:47.040
as well as many other terrorist organizations.

261
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.280
<v 0>The straw was when guitar.</v>

262
00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:54.890
<v 1>Started supporting Pru Iranian groups at this point,</v>

263
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.370
Saudi Arabia and its allies made a trade embargo against guitar.

264
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.940
And you may be wondering, so why didn't they do this with Oman?

265
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.530
The answer is the Oman didn't support any terrorists or any armed group.

266
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.720
They just kept good ties with everybody,

267
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.360
but without trying to play any significant, GeoBlue

268
00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:19.270
Another great example of this little profile diplomacy is the Yemeni civil war.

269
00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.340
Yemen shares a border with Oman,

270
00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.970
but instead of supporting either of the two contenders in this war,

271
00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:29.560
women is just securing as border and supplying humanitarian aid. I mean,

272
00:15:29.561 --> 00:15:32.140
really every country in the region was like Oman.

273
00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.090
The middle East would be a peaceful place.

274
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.720
And Oman achieves more with these friendly relations with our allies rivals than

275
00:15:37.721 --> 00:15:41.770
just acting on cynical power. Please, Oman is an important diplomatic hub.

276
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.950
For example, the joint comprehensive plan of action. AKA,

277
00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.310
the Iran nuclear deal was negotiated in Oman.

278
00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.070
This explains why Oman rarely appears on the news.

279
00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.010
And when it does is for things like this.

280
00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:03.190
<v 2>Amman foot's $1 million bail to free us hikers to American hikers who had been</v>

281
00:16:03.191 --> 00:16:07.720
jailed in Iran for over two years were released on Sunday after the Sultan of

282
00:16:07.721 --> 00:16:10.120
Oman paid there, $1 million bail,

283
00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:14.950
Salton caboose inside also paid for the release of a third American hiker,

284
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.820
Sarah shroud last year, the Atlantic 2011, but all of this.

285
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.390
<v 1>Was the work of Sultan. Qaboos the new Sultan Mr. High theme,</v>

286
00:16:22.391 --> 00:16:26.170
Ben Tariq has inherited a much richer and more modern country that has friendly

287
00:16:26.171 --> 00:16:27.004
ties with all.

288
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:33.160
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

289
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.610
<v 1>No, you make, think that everything seems bright for this oil rich country,</v>

290
00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:41.200
right? The new self-tan can just sit tight and watch this oil revenue Roland as

291
00:16:41.201 --> 00:16:44.740
citizens becoming happier and richer and keeping out of international news

292
00:16:44.741 --> 00:16:46.630
headlines. Right? Well,

293
00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:50.890
far from it as so often happens with all the countries in this region.

294
00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:53.260
Oman is extremely reliant on oil,

295
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.830
more than 80% of the government's revenue just comes from this sweet,

296
00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:59.950
sweet dinosaur juice. And this is one hell of a problem.

297
00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.130
When oil markets go down, which is exactly what has happened.

298
00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.473
<v 0>No.</v>

299
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:12.550
<v 1>2014 Oil prices have tank and this trend has become even more</v>

300
00:17:12.551 --> 00:17:14.890
dire during the coronavirus crisis. Basically,

301
00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.170
if a man doesn't want to go back to being a poor country,

302
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.290
there is only one thing that they can do diversify.

303
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:25.150
This is what will man 2040 plan hopes to achieve just like Saudi Arabia or the

304
00:17:25.151 --> 00:17:26.560
United Arab Emirates. Well,

305
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:30.190
man is trying to focus on high-tech manufacturing and tourism.

306
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.890
More specifically, they are trying to attract Indian tourism.

307
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:37.180
They have even started to build a brand new high-tech city called D U Q M,

308
00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.280
which is a weird name for a setting. Ideally,

309
00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:40.930
this city could become the new Dubai,

310
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:44.350
but it's still too soon to see if this project will be a success.

311
00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:50.130
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

312
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.080
<v 1>They're beginning to run out of capital.</v>

313
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:57.120
Their 2020 debts to GDP ratio is around 60% and rising fast,

314
00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.000
but the pain doesn't end there in June of 2020,

315
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.960
Moody's downgraded or man sovereignty rating for the second team and a year down

316
00:18:03.961 --> 00:18:07.650
to a non-investment junk level and Oman bodily needs investment to make its

317
00:18:07.651 --> 00:18:09.360
diversification strategy work.

318
00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:12.900
It seems mine is in a rut for the team being unable to make money from its oil

319
00:18:12.901 --> 00:18:17.010
that desperately needs to encourage investors to fund his projects faced with

320
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:17.970
this situation. Well,

321
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.960
mine's modernization blitz has been put on hold and when it can resume it's

322
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:26.400
anyone's guess this coupled with a new Salton who's rained for less than a year

323
00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.590
makes Oman's future uncertain.

324
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:36.800
So no, the question is will the new Salton managed to really diversify Oman?

325
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:40.430
Well, he continued making Oman the most tolerant country on the Arab peninsula.

326
00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:43.760
Well, all mine managed to catch up with its other wealthy neighbors.

327
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:44.930
So as always,
