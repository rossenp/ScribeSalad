00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.260
<v 0>This video is sponsored by Finnama is in this day and age,</v>

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.130
we all know that we should be working smarter, getting our money to work for us.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.240
But if you're anything like me,

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.060
that seems like a lot of time and a pretty long time commitment.

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.780
So how can we keep up with what's happening in the world of investing or more

6
00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:17.280
basically, where do you start?

7
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.860
If you're completely new to the world of investing? Well,

8
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.370
today's video is sponsored by [inaudible] and they can really help you with

9
00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:25.320
that. Minimize is an app that was designed to,

10
00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:27.720
particularly with young busy people in mind.

11
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.750
The idea is to give you the information and tools you need to invest with

12
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:35.190
confidence and eventually empower you to become your own financial advisor.

13
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.020
We've been playing around with it for a couple of days.

14
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:40.410
So let me share with you a few features. So as you'd expect,

15
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.590
they have the financial news packaged in the daily brief.

16
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.310
And here you have the option of text or audio summaries that you could easily

17
00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:49.560
digest on your commute, or while you're walking the dog,

18
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.510
but when you actually want to go even deeper,

19
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.760
but you also have these 100 plus packs.

20
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.920
I know that research was often a stumbling block for me.

21
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.530
It's just so time time-consuming. But with these packs,

22
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.580
you really get a comprehensive outline of top industries or companies that you

23
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:06.480
may be looking at. Another thing that I liked was the chat function,

24
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.180
where you can ask questions to others in the finance community.

25
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.890
And once you find your feet,

26
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.490
there are Q and a sessions with investing pros and analyst to in a nutshell,

27
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.760
minimize brings the biggest financial news and professional insights to young

28
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:18.810
investors in language.

29
00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:23.010
People can actually understand that demystifying approach carries over into the

30
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:24.450
user experience as well.

31
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.900
I found their design really good and uncluttered overall.

32
00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:30.780

So check it out [inaudible] and now let's get into it.

39
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.193
<v 1>Video.</v>

40
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.920
<v 0>Sometimes miracles really do exist even in the cold hard world of economics.</v>

41
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.040
Look at what happened in Japan after the second world war

42
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.520
For almost 20 years, between 1955 and 1973,

43
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.580
the Japanese economy grew at an annual average of 9%.

44
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.530
And that wasn't all for most of the following two decades from 1973 to 1990

45
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.200
average annual economic growth was over 4%.

46
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.220
It was what became known as the Japanese economic miracle in barely three

47
00:02:37.221 --> 00:02:37.761
decades.

48
00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:41.900
Japan went from being a war torn country to becoming an industrial and financial

49
00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:44.270
powerhouse, largest international creditor.

50
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.220
And one of the richest countries on the planet,

51
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.980
the factories were working on a piece work basis.

52
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.400
The Japanese did not know what it was like to be unemployed and the savings of

53
00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:55.460
families and companies just kept grubbing in the eighties,

54
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.680
Japanese companies where the great technological benchmark it wasn't to see that

55
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:02.740
their domination over the electronics industry was overwhelming.

56
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.370
The VHS players, the pocket radios, the cameras,

57
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.870
the video game industry,

58
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.580
the Walkman virtually all advances in consumer electronics and almost all the

59
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:14.920
major fashion companies were located in Japan.

60
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.940
The feeling of prosperity was sub intense that at the time forecasts indicated

61
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:22.540
that sooner or later the Japanese economy would even outgrow the economy of the

62
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:26.080
United States. Japan was destined to become the world's largest sector.

63
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.970
<v 1>But.</v>

64
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.350
<v 0>As we all know, that never happened. The prediction as so often happens,</v>

65
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.990
simply remained just that the prediction,

66
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.270
the reality was very different in 1990,

67
00:03:42.271 --> 00:03:46.260
a huge economic and financial crisis broke out from which the country,

68
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.680
even today, 30 years later still has not fully recovered,

69
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.090
but what exactly happened?

70
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.720
How did the Japanese miracle give way to decades of economic crisis and

71
00:03:54.721 --> 00:03:55.554
stagnation?

72
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.980
What was it that created one of the biggest bubbles in history to answer these

73
00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:01.380
questions, we have to go all the way back to the 1995.

74
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.980
<v 1>The Plaza accord.</v>

75
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.990
<v 0>During the first five years of the 1980s,</v>

76
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.010
the us dollar appreciated by 50% against the Japanese yet the German Mark,

77
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.900
the French Franc and the British pound.

78
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.710
This made us exports more expensive and imports cheaper,

79
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.600
which caused the trade deficit to climb to 3.5% of the us gross domestic price.

80
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.130
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

81
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.430
<v 0>The result was that for the first time, since the end of world war one,</v>

82
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.180
the United States became a country in debts to the rest of the world. This fact,

83
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.570
together with the difficulty of large American companies to sell their products,

84
00:04:51.571 --> 00:04:55.410
abroad became the main political and economic concern of the time. Now,

85
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.200
what does all this have to do with what happened in Japan?

86
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:00.870
<v 1>What is quite simple.</v>

87
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.590
<v 0>Pressure from the United States led the finance ministers and central bank</v>

88
00:05:04.591 --> 00:05:07.740
governors of the five most industrialized companies in the world at the time.

89
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.850
[inaudible], you know, to States Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France,

90
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.170
to make an agreement at a meeting,

91
00:05:13.171 --> 00:05:17.190
held at the Plaza hotel in New York to intervene in the foreign exchange market

92
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.630
in order to the value of the dollar.

93
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.650
I did look for example, at what happens to the Yen's value against the dollar.

94
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.720
<v 1>In.</v>

95
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.050
<v 0>Just a few months, the dollar depreciated by 50% against the yen,</v>

96
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.160
which obviously put a strain on the Japanese export machine after all United

97
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.470
States was by far the Japanese industry's largest customer,

98
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.100
at least 40% of all Japanese exports went to U S consumers.

99
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.160
<v 1>Well.</v>

100
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.010
<v 0>Fact is that these laws or agreements were a real turning point.</v>

101
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.160
It was that this point, if there's a huge financial bubble began to develop,

102
00:05:56.161 --> 00:05:58.970
that would wipe prosperity away. Five years later,

103
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.610
pay attention to the two main players in this whole story.

104
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:05.350
<v 1>Panic in the Japanese government.</v>

105
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.560
<v 0>The central bank of Japan behind its doors.</v>

106
00:06:14.561 --> 00:06:18.670
Many of the decisions that led to the great Japanese bubble were made you see

107
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.790
after the Plaza record and the consequent devaluation of the dollar,

108
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.210
the alarm went off amongst the Japanese authorities and the large industrial

109
00:06:25.211 --> 00:06:26.140
groups in the country.

110
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.800
Wouldn't the loss of 50% of the value of the dollar in just a few months,

111
00:06:29.801 --> 00:06:33.520
be a serious problem for the competitiveness of the Japanese industry. Well,

112
00:06:33.521 --> 00:06:36.580
to try to deal with this situation and avoid the risk of crisis,

113
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.720
the government and the central bank of Japan basically decided to do two things

114
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.220
to boost domestic demand that is consumption and to implement an expansive

115
00:06:45.221 --> 00:06:48.910
monetary policy that would try to compensate for the effects of the Plaza

116
00:06:48.911 --> 00:06:51.730
accord. In this way, in the following two years,

117
00:06:51.731 --> 00:06:53.800
interest rates were reduced by 50%.

118
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.340
The government significantly increased public spending and Japanese banks and

119
00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:58.391
coverage by the countries earned.

120
00:06:58.391 --> 00:07:01.660
The authorities began to lend enormous amounts of money to families and

121
00:07:01.661 --> 00:07:05.320
companies so that they could launch themselves into the real estate and capital

122
00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:06.430
markets. Obviously,

123
00:07:06.431 --> 00:07:10.030
this policy caused the prices of real estate assets to start rising steeply,

124
00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.630
which in turn increased their value as collateral and therefore the ability of

125
00:07:13.631 --> 00:07:17.200
families and businesses to borrow more and more. And just like that,

126
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.350
the vicious spiral of the real estate bubble had been set up.

127
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.160
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

128
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.480
<v 0>Don't forget that Japan had been characterized as a country of savers. In fact,</v>

129
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.510
in 1995, it was already the world's largest creditor.

130
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.880
Well with the fall in fixed income yields,

131
00:07:39.881 --> 00:07:41.680
as a result of the new monetary policy,

132
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.280
Japanese savers began to direct more funds to the stock market and the real

133
00:07:45.281 --> 00:07:47.140
estate market, which further fed the bubble.

134
00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.590
But these were not the only causes nor the only ones responsible for the huge

135
00:07:53.591 --> 00:07:54.370
Japanese bubble.

136
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.790
There is at least one other key catalyst for understanding how such a

137
00:07:57.791 --> 00:07:59.260
catastrophic balloon was inflated,

138
00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.900
a catalyst that has a lot to do with the stock market.

139
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.850
Have you ever heard of Zytech.

140
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.590
<v 1>Listen up the business of speculation.</v>

141
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:19.360
<v 0>Between 1985 and 1989, Japan experienced enormous prosperity.</v>

142
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:20.680
At least it appeared that way.

143
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.340
The average price of housing increased by more than 300% in that period.

144
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:25.450
And during these years,

145
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.710
the Nicola stock exchange index tripled its value to reach 39,000 points.

146
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.910
It represented one third of the world's total market capitalization. Well,

147
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:38.050
the fact is that a financial engineering technique known as Zytech had a lot to

148
00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:41.950
do with this whole process, you see taking advantage of the low interest rates.

149
00:08:41.951 --> 00:08:45.700
The big Japanese conglomerates began to take out large loans to finance the

150
00:08:45.701 --> 00:08:47.500
purchase of shares and real estate.

151
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.440
Something that allowed them to fatten their bottom lines. Why?

152
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.830
Because at the time accounting standards allowed these companies to present

153
00:08:53.831 --> 00:08:57.450
capital gains as income. So the more shares were revalued,

154
00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.550
the greater the benefits. In other words,

155
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.640
the more money companies borrowed and the more shares they bought, the higher,

156
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:03.810
the share price Rose,

157
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.220
which in turn increased the company's profits and the cycle started over with

158
00:09:08.221 --> 00:09:12.030
higher profits. They had more capacity to borrow. And so on. Again.

159
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.333
<v 1>They can</v>

160
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.380
give you an idea more than half.

161
00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.630
<v 0>Of the companies listed on the Tokyo stock exchange.</v>

162
00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:27.830
We're involved in this system in 1988, 38% of Toyota's profits,

163
00:09:27.831 --> 00:09:29.780
65% of Nissan's profits.

164
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:33.620
And 63% of Sony's profits were generated by this activity.

165
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:37.280
And don't think they were isolated cases. No, not at all.

166
00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:40.010
It is estimated that by the end of the 1980s,

167
00:09:40.011 --> 00:09:44.780
between 40 and 50% of the corporate profits of all the major Japanese companies

168
00:09:44.781 --> 00:09:47.270
were generated using this financial technique,

169
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.320
a technique that produced increasingly higher and higher valuations,

170
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.820
All this was happening while many company's core business was not doing

171
00:10:04.821 --> 00:10:08.300
particularly well after the Plaza record and the consequent revaluation of the

172
00:10:08.301 --> 00:10:08.690
yen,

173
00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:12.260
the operating margins of the large Japanese companies that were more oriented

174
00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:15.860
towards exports narrowed considerably that is Japanese companies were

175
00:10:15.861 --> 00:10:19.220
increasingly in debt and their activities were becoming less profitable.

176
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:23.480
But despite this, their profits were growing and growing. Thanks to [inaudible].

177
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.910
It was an unsustainable situation.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.360
<v 2>The peak of the bubble.</v>

179

value of the real estate markets cause a widespread feeling of.

181
00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.850
<v 1>Well, it was a surreal world.</v>

182
00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.030
<v 2>Old as if money was dripping from the trees overnight,</v>

183
00:10:50.031 --> 00:10:54.230
the Japanese person who owned a plot of land became rich without doing anything

tagged Murphy banker.

185
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.390
<v 0>The assets of the Japanese just kept growing at full speed.</v>

186
00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.960
These were the years when Japanese tourists camera in hand field,

187
00:11:02.961 --> 00:11:07.640
the luxury stores of the world's major cities, and no wonder in 1990,

188
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:12.020
it was estimated that the Japanese real estate sector as a whole was worth five

189
00:11:12.021 --> 00:11:15.320
times more than the entire us real estate market.

190
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.850
The estimated value of Japanese golf courses alone was over $500 billion.

191
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.600
There were even some calculations that warned that the sale of an Imperial

192
00:11:23.601 --> 00:11:28.490
palace in downtown Tokyo alone would have been enough to buy all the real estate

193
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.020
in California for its part.

194
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.160
The stock market was also breaking record after record the Nikkei index Rose

195
00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:37.400
from 11,542 points in December,

196
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.100
1984 to almost 39,000 points in December, 1989.

197
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:48.020
Talking about an annual revaluation of almost 30% that must've been quite a

198
00:11:48.021 --> 00:11:48.854
party.

199
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.230
<v 2>January 2nd, 1990, the Japanese stock market generates two types of investors.</v>

200
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.380
The believers and the skeptics believers are getting rich.

201
00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:05.620
The skeptics are suffering just when the market seems overvalued.

202
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.000
It doesn't stop rising.

203
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.480
Marcus w broccoli journalists at the wall street journal.

204
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:14.910
<v 0>According to data from the international monetary fund in 1989,</v>

205
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:19.560
Japanese stocks were trading at a P E R at a price earnings ratio of more than

206
00:12:19.561 --> 00:12:24.390
60 while the us and UK stock exchanges were trading at a P E R of 15

207
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.660
and 12 respectively of course, as is always the case.

208
00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:30.960
There was no lack of arguments to support these figures. In this case,

209
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:34.290
there were three main explanations. Firstly, Japanese economy,

210
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.830
which is closely linked to technology had greater growth potential second,

211
00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:41.400
that the profits of Japanese companies were growing much faster than their peers

212
00:12:41.401 --> 00:12:45.450
in the United States and Europe and firmly that the balance sheets of Japanese

213
00:12:45.451 --> 00:12:49.260
companies concealed significant capital gains and their real estate, of course,

214
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:52.620
in 1989 with companies quoting PRS above 60,

215
00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.350
the justification seemed increasingly difficult to swallow.

216
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:03.690
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

217
00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:04.830
<v 0>Fact, in that same year,</v>

218
00:13:04.831 --> 00:13:07.530
the Japanese authorities began to see the writing on the wall.

219
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.830
The company debt kept growing and growing while their competitiveness was

220
00:13:10.831 --> 00:13:12.450
deteriorating at full speed.

221
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.630
Inflation was at risk of skyrocketing and the housing market was already

222
00:13:15.631 --> 00:13:19.080
completely inaccessible to young people faced with such a scenario.

223
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.140
They tried to make a gradual descent, but things had already gone too far.

224
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.560
When the central bank began to slow down the expansionary monetary policy,

225
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:26.850
everything simple fell apart.

226
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.100
And just like that, the bubble burst in just two years,

227
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:39.780
the Tokyo stock exchange fell by more than 60% corporate profits plummeted

228
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.830
Zyrtec was operating in reverse. Not only not was it not adding value,

229
00:13:43.831 --> 00:13:48.390
but subtracting it real estate prices also suffered a very hard adjustment and

230
00:13:48.391 --> 00:13:52.830
both banks and large companies face serious liquidity and solvency problems.

231
00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:54.990
Bubble had burst and taken with it.

232
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:59.010
The entire prosperity of the Japanese economy. Today, 30 years later,

233
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.670
many economic problems derive from this process are still being worked through.

234
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:05.670
And then the client index sits at around 23,000 points,

235
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.700
40% below the historical peaks. It reached 30 years ago.

236
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:16.410
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

237
00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:16.860
<v 0>Short.</v>

238
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:21.000
This is the story of how Japan experienced one of the wildest financial bubbles

239
00:14:21.001 --> 00:14:23.640
of all time. During the second half of the 1980s.

240
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.890
The question we can now ask is,

241
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:29.550
do you think we can draw any lessons from this whole experience if your answers
