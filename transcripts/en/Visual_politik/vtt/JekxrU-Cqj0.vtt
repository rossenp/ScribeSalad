00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.110
<v 0>This video is brought to you by news voice, the news.</v>

2
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.870
<v 1>As broken almost all us media is owned by just a handful of big corporations.</v>

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.420
Fake news is obviously a huge problem as well.

4
00:00:11.421 --> 00:00:13.940
And finding something unbiased can be difficult.

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.280
News voice is revolutionizing the news landscape.

6
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.910
It's an app that gives you a personalized newsfeeds by aggregating major news

7
00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:20.270
sites,

8
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.960
as well as international and independent media giving some much needed balance.

9
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.000
Each news story shows multiple sources,

10
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.370
which are all times with our bias and perspective.

11
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.390
The news affects almost everything in our lives. What we hear on re shapes,

12
00:00:32.391 --> 00:00:35.930
which people we trust, what we eat, what we buy, how we vote,

13
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.170
even how we think news voice is greeted by its readers.

14
00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:41.330
As you can avoid stories that you find interesting.

15
00:00:41.331 --> 00:00:45.200
So more people will see them as essentially a democratized platform for news

16
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.430
plus saves you time.

17
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.580
You get all the news and all the sources and one app so that you can be better

18
00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:53.120
informed and it's totally free, which I approve of as I'm Scottish.

19
00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:54.650
And we don't like spending money. Anyway,

20
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.160
get started with news voice today for free through the link below it's available

21
00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:01.040
on both Google play and the app store. Anyway, let's get correct.

22
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.420
<v 0>Okay.</v>

23
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.300
<v 1>I asked you to tell me three things,</v>

24
00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:19.910
three things about this country without consulting, Google,

25
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.960
what would you come up with? One is easy to may be possible, but for three,

26
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.680
my guess is that most of you would be struggling. Am I wrong? And quite frankly,

27
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.543
it's not surprising.

28
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.910
Bhutan is one of the least known and most isolated countries in the world.

29
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.670
Not only geographically, but also, and most importantly,

30
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.150
politically and commercially be honest. Have you ever really thought about it?

31
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.600
How does things work in this country? What does Butan produce? Who's in charge.

32
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.530
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.440
<v 1>And there's a small kingdom located in the very heart of the Himalayas.</v>

34
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.390
It's very similar in size to Switzerland.

35
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.750
And like Switzerland is also a very mountainous nation. However,

36
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.530
that's sort of where the similarities end with a population 10 times smaller

37
00:01:57.531 --> 00:02:00.590
than Switzerland and the level of development that places that among the poorest

38
00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:04.310
countries and the world Bhutan is a kind of Herrmann kingdom that was completely

39
00:02:04.311 --> 00:02:08.090
closed until just a few years ago. Its greatest international achievement. Well,

40
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.980
according to its government being the happiest.

41
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.183
<v 0>Three in the world.</v>

42
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.330
<v 1>That's not something that we're completely sure about in this video.</v>

43
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.420
We'll go into Bhutan. We'll talk about it. Society, economy,

44
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.160
and political system. And not only that,

45
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.800
we're also going to tell you some things that you probably would never have

46
00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:28.670
associated with a police. That's supposed to be the happiest nation on earth.

47
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.890
Are you coming to Bhutan with us? Let's get started then.

48
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.730
<v 0>Tan reasons to be happy.</v>

49
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.400
<v 1>We've done as a country with such pure air that it could almost be sold in a</v>

50
00:02:43.401 --> 00:02:45.740
can, which let's be honest we might need to do in the future.

51
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.070
I'm not because it's one of the most environmentally intact and best preserved

52
00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:51.410
countries on the planet to give you an idea.

53
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.200
Almost three quarters of the country is covered in forests.

54
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.250
And 60% of the national territory has been declared as protected areas.

55
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.330
This includes a natural park, the sack Tang wildlife sanctuary,

56
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.390
which was basically created for the preservation of the MICU, the Yeti,

57
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.620
the abominable snowman. No,

58
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:08.410
really the greats is a national park for the Yeti Scotland,

59
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:11.770
making a national park for Nassi was that we did that really that's right

60
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:15.250
though. And this country, they take tradition very, very seriously.

61
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.410
In other words, Bhutan is something of a Relic from another era,

62
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.160
a natural paradise in which tourism was not allowed until 1974,

63
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.920
which is coincidentally the ear where the shirt comes from. And even today,

64
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.671
if you want to visit,

65
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:30.610
let's just say that tourism here is very different from anywhere else.

66
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.340
You see tourists who arrive in the country in addition to transport,

67
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.630
have to pay a daily fee, ranging from a range 200 to $290. However,

68
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.650
this rate acts as a kind of flat rate, it includes a gate, your hotel and food.

69
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.340
And other words,

70
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.520
the only way to visit this country is to book a tourist package through the

71
00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:51.120
government.

72
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.030
It's kind of strange when you think perhaps this is one of the reasons why there

73
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.600
are just over 270,000 tourists who visited every year

74
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.480
In case my visual politics runs without a doubt.

75
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.810
The most characteristic element of Bhutan has nothing to do with either

76
00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:08.670
tourists, hikers or anything like that.

77
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.850
But with a political innovation that launched its government almost five days.

78
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.163
<v 0>Cool.</v>

79
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.970
<v 1>In 1972, as a way to overcome criticism about the country's high poverty rates.</v>

80
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.520
And at the same time, trying to reconcile with the modern world,

81
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.850
the particular traditional lifestyle of Britain, the then King of this country,

82
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.110
[inaudible] proposed a new way to measure progress and general wellbeing.

83
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.680
It was a shift in focus from gross domestic product to something known as the

84
00:04:34.681 --> 00:04:36.510
gross national happiness index,

85
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.660
a new indicator that takes into account things like psychological wellbeing,

86
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.150
community relations, health access to education,

87
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.900
or how you use your time that as this new indicator seeks to compliment the

88
00:04:45.901 --> 00:04:49.410
material aspects of progress with the most spiritual and psychological part of

89
00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:51.540
the human being that's at least was.

90
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.440
<v 0>Of course.</v>

91
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.720
<v 1>Having said that a lot of people may be thinking, Oh,</v>

92
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.470
so this is kind of interesting. So Bhutan is a world leader in happiness. Well,

93
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.460
no, the truth is it's not at all, not even within its own index,

94
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.070
either that Malian kingdom is nowhere near the top.

95
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.980
According to the 2019 world happiness report,

96
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.400
which the United nations initiative called the sustainable development solutions

97
00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:21.360
network and which presents annually, Bhutan is not even in the top 10, nor 20.

98
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.570
It's not even in the top 50 happiest countries in the world.

99
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.710
It ranks all the way down and 95th place just above Cameroon.

100
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.770
A possession does not seem to be in line with this image of being one of the

101
00:05:31.771 --> 00:05:33.060
happiest countries in the world,

102
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.850
nor with the apparent importance they place on this very concept.

103
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.940
<v 0>So.</v>

104
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.000
<v 1>It's kind of surprising when you think, by the way, here's a question,</v>

105
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:44.160
which countries do you think are the happiest,

106
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.110
according to this curious indicator? Well,

107
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.860
the ranking is led by countries like Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, New Zealand,

108
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.840
Canada, Israel, Poland. That is,

109
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.380
it turns out that this particular ranking of gross happiness is closely related

110
00:05:55.381 --> 00:05:59.150
to the rates of prosperity, economic and wealth per capita. In other words,

111
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.190
the retro country is sooner or later,

112
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.980
it also tends to reap better results in terms of happiness.

113
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.550
Are you surprised because you really shouldn't be, but that's for another time,

114
00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:10.910
let's not get distracted. As we said, even in this ranking of gross happiness,

115
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.870
Bhutan is found in a possession as low as 95th. So in other words,

116
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.520
they've kind of messed up haven't they?

117
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.120
Because almost every time we see in the press news-related to this index,

118
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.910
it always seems that Bhutan is the happiest country in the world.

119
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.370
And as you see, it's not even close, not by a long way.

120
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.940
So now the question we have to ask ourselves is why is Bhutan really such an

121
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:29.774
unhappy.

122
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.753
<v 0>Country?</v>

123
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.800
<v 1>You see,</v>

124
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.040
even if this country has managed to double its life expectancy in the last 20

125
00:06:36.041 --> 00:06:39.820
years and is able to put almost 100% of children in primary education,

126
00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.940
the truth is that things are not exactly going well today.

127
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.440
A quarter of the nearly 800,000 Bhutanese survive on less than $1 and

128
00:06:47.441 --> 00:06:48.760
25 cents a day,

129
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.180
which is the amount that is considered to be the extreme poverty threshold.

130
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.690
This is why Bhutan always appears on the list of least developed countries that

131
00:06:55.691 --> 00:06:57.100
the UN prepares each year.

132
00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.083
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

133
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.740
<v 1>No, only that, although we are talking about a relatively calm country,</v>

134
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.860
violent crimes have increased and street gangs on the trafficking of goods for

135
00:07:05.861 --> 00:07:08.920
food for sale on the black market are becoming more frequent to top.

136
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.710
All this off climate change is also affecting a country.

137
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.600
I simply not been prepared for it.

138
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:16.720
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

139
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.530
<v 1>As you can imagine,</v>

140
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.530
the change in weather patterns has become a problem in a country that remains

141
00:07:20.531 --> 00:07:22.420
very, very dependent on nature,

142
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.930
a country where industry is virtually non-existent and we're 70% of the

143
00:07:25.931 --> 00:07:27.820
population are small holder farmers.

144
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.160
The fact that less and less snow and rainfall,

145
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.060
or that they fall more irregularly causes many crops to be lost year after year

146
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:34.923
after year.

147
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.360
And of course the lack of technological development in agriculture,

148
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.030
it causes situations like this one.

149
00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.470
<v 2>The temperature has got hotter.</v>

150
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.620
So there are more insects in the fruit and grain. I don't understand it,

151
00:07:47.621 --> 00:07:48.790
but if it continues,

152
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.720
we're going to have many problems in growing food and feeding ourselves.

153
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.810
Dawa chairing Bhutanese farmer from pero.

154
00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.940
<v 1>We'll just wait one second.</v>

155
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.450
There's also a bond in the land of the thunder dragon. Well, fortunately not.

156
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160
<v 0>Bruton.</v>

157
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.750
<v 1>Also has its strong points. Over the last few years, things have improved.</v>

158
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.930
The economy has grown. The government invests a good chunk of that tourist tax.

159
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.360
When we're talking about enter preserving and developing its tourist

160
00:08:13.361 --> 00:08:13.930
attractions.

161
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.200
And of course there is a field in which this country could become a power.

162
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.350
We're talking about hydro power, the cheapest energy in the world,

163
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.880
and one which Bhutan already.

164
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.373
<v 0>Exports.</v>

165
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.920
<v 1>Thanks to its impressive mountainous geography.</v>

166
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.620
Bhutan is a Mecca of hydroelectric power in the region.

167
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.590
Most of the power produced is exported to India and the revenue from these

168
00:08:32.591 --> 00:08:36.490
exports alone already accounts for almost 30% of the government's revenue and

169
00:08:36.491 --> 00:08:38.500
14% of its gross domestic product.

170
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.070
And other words hydro-power is potentially the blue gold of this country.

171
00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.310
And let's not forget the Bhutanese neighbors are huge countries that are

172
00:08:45.311 --> 00:08:49.030
devouring energy constantly between India and nearby Bangladesh alone.

173
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.850
We are talking about more than 1.6 billion people.

174
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.190
<v 0>By way. Most of the hydro.</v>

175
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.170
<v 1>Plants have been built by Indian companies.</v>

176
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.160
India is in fact Bhutan's greatest ally with politically and above all else

177
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.630
economically, to give you an idea,

178
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.810
India is the country from which almost 90% of imports come.

179
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.140
And as the destination of more than 80% of Bhutan's exports,

180
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:13.710
very few countries in the world have as dependent a relationship as Bhutan's

181
00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:17.160
towards its Southern neighbor. But this leads us to a key question.

182
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.770
Are we missing someone in this equation? Many of you may be thinking,

183
00:09:19.771 --> 00:09:21.360
so where is China in all this.

184
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:24.410
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

185
00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.680
<v 1>On paper. It kind of seems like a no brainer for China's expansion strategy.</v>

186
00:09:27.681 --> 00:09:30.920
Here's a pure country in development with a significant lack of both investment

187
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.360
and infrastructure. I don't really know.

188
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.240
It kind of seems like the type of place where China would like to invest and

189
00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:36.440
sink his closet. Doesn't it.

190
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.110
And the truth is that Chinese investments and aid have grown in recent years,

191
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.720
especially when it comes to health and education. However,

192
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.570
the kingdom of Bhutan remains faithful to its ND and ally.

193
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.430
So faithful has even come to reject.

194
00:09:49.431 --> 00:09:51.590
Beijing's offered to be part of the new silk roads,

195
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.350
the gigantic infrastructure network promoted by Zhang pink.

196
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.740
And although the Chinese presence is gradually being noticed. For example,

197
00:09:57.741 --> 00:10:00.830
it was a Chinese company that built the gigantic Buddha door, Denver statue,

198
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.890
a statue covered in gold leaf that has become one of the symbols of the country.

199
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.380
Chinese presence today remains mostly in the background

200
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.020
Beyond their spiritual or economic peculiarities.

201
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:15.380
There are some things in supposedly country of happiness that are never talked

202
00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:18.980
about. It's the other site of the romantic Emily and kingdom. Let's take a look.

203
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.090
The most unknown side.

204
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.690
The image of the Butan conveys to the world is that of a tranquil peaceful and

205
00:10:32.691 --> 00:10:34.190
above all Placid country.

206
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:37.070
And I do like Buddhist kingdom and the heart of the Himalayas.

207
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.470
And to some extent it may be just that. However,

208
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.040
as we always say here on visual politic, all that glitters is not always.

209
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:43.993
<v 0>Cool.</v>

210
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.730
<v 1>And as we have seen, Bhutan is a very poor country and that's not,</v>

211
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:50.720
it's only downstate.

212
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:53.840
What would you think if I were to tell you that Bhutan is actually a country

213
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.680
where there has been in some way remains institutional persecution and

214
00:10:57.681 --> 00:10:59.810
discrimination of ethnic minorities? Well,

215
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.360
you probably won't be surprised to hear that that is more or less what happened

216
00:11:02.361 --> 00:11:04.880
to the lot Sampa and Nepalese speaking, ethnic minorities.

217
00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.713
<v 0>I see.</v>

218
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:12.080
<v 1>So here's the deal since 1988 and throughout the 1990s tens and tens of</v>

219
00:11:12.081 --> 00:11:14.750
thousands of lots of Amper people have been stripped of their Brittany's

220
00:11:14.751 --> 00:11:17.480
documentation and turned into stateless persons,

221
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:22.550
an estimated 800,000 to 100,000 people ended up displaced in refugee camps in

222
00:11:22.551 --> 00:11:25.940
Nepal and India comes where they were for nearly two decades before they get

223
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.100
immigrate to other countries in 2017,

224
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.370
the us state department and a human rights report on Bhutan noted that the

225
00:11:31.371 --> 00:11:33.770
country still has Nepalese speaking, political prisoners.

226
00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:37.100
The government refuses to reinstate many of the refugees who have claimed

227
00:11:37.101 --> 00:11:37.934
Bhutanese citizens.

228
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:44.300
Are you sure you're talking about Bhutan, the kingdom of the thunder dragon,

229
00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.690
the Adeleke country whose government supposedly makes and measures its decisions

230
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.060
in terms of general happiness. Well, yes.

231
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.650
And the question is where does this hatred of ethnic minorities from,

232
00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:57.150
Well,

233
00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.060
that may be surprising as something that has a lot to do with its obsession,

234
00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:03.660
with maintaining national tradition and culture at all costs.

235
00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.400
You may never have thought about it, but in a way,

236
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.580
Bhutan is one of the most nationalistic countries in the world.

237
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:09.930
So in order to get rid of them,

238
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.690
the Bhutanese government determined that the lot Sampa were no more than

239
00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:14.850
newcomers, something like illegal immigrants,

240
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.080
despite this ethnic group having lived in Southern Bruton's since at least 1620.

241
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:22.110
So the fact is that the group's expulsion came under the boots and these

242
00:12:22.111 --> 00:12:25.260
citizenship laws of 1958 and 1985.

243
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.560
So although many lots of people were given nationality in 1958,

244
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:32.190
many others were unable to prove definitively that they recited in Bhutan before

245
00:12:32.191 --> 00:12:32.730
that year,

246
00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:36.990
I conditioned to the later in 1985 law rigidly demanded and applied in a totally

247
00:12:36.991 --> 00:12:39.660
arbitrary manner. Think about it logically for just one moment,

248
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.480
imagine that you are in a family of peasants who live under the poverty

249
00:12:42.481 --> 00:12:45.360
threshold and you basically live on whatever you can grow from the lunch.

250
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.890
You probably can't read or write,

251
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.980
and there are no records of ownership of your lens or anything like that.

252
00:12:49.981 --> 00:12:53.010
So I want arts, do you show that you've been living in that place for decades?

253
00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.350
If the testimony of your neighbors doesn't count for anything,

254
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.770
this is the situation more or less that many members of this ethnicity

255
00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.490
experienced.

256
00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.730
They went from being born and living in Bhutan to becoming an illegal immigrants

257
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.250
and being forcibly expelled from their own country.

258
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.380
Something that obviously had consequence

259
00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.970
Expulsion of tens of thousands of member of the lots AMPA ethnic group led to an

260
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.270
ethnic military conflict that ended up with a confrontation of the Royal Bhutan

261
00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.660
army with armed members of this social group. According to the government,

262
00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:24.600
just two members of the security forces lost their lives. Of course,

263
00:13:24.601 --> 00:13:25.710
from unofficial sources,

264
00:13:25.711 --> 00:13:29.100
the figure rises to at least 300 deaths and more than 2000 deaths.

265
00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.060
<v 0>So.</v>

266
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.060
<v 1>Visual politics, Bhutan's political system as a peculiar thing.</v>

267
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.850
And today it doesn't much resemble a consolidated democracy.

268
00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:39.773
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

269
00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.800
<v 1>The idea the first democratic elections were in 2007 and the first government</v>

270
00:13:46.801 --> 00:13:51.750
elected entirely by the ballot box and a free election did not arrive until 2011

271
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.040
before then basically what was,

272
00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:56.880
there was an absolute monarchy and the purest style of medieval feudalism.

273
00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:57.570
And of course,

274
00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.050
is this a recent history of authoritarianism that explains that in many areas of

275
00:14:01.051 --> 00:14:02.220
politics and society,

276
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.850
respect for human rights or political and social freedoms are not a priority.

277
00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:06.713
Listen up.

278
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.020
<v 2>Many of the authoritarian structures built by King Jimmy,</v>

279
00:14:10.021 --> 00:14:14.250
the fourth are still working. Monarchy has not yielded significant power.

280
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.940
This system combined civil liberties with political authoritarianism,

281
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.160
academic doorbell resolve in his book,

282
00:14:20.161 --> 00:14:23.040
the Royal semi authoritarian democracy of Bhutan.

283
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.210
<v 1>Anyway, as you can see,</v>

284
00:14:24.211 --> 00:14:27.090
we're talking about a country strictly controlled by the government and the

285
00:14:27.091 --> 00:14:29.370
Royal family, a country, to which, for example,

286
00:14:29.371 --> 00:14:33.210
television did not arrive until it was legalized in 1999.

287
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.390
We're speaking for better or worse of what's perhaps one of the least

288
00:14:36.391 --> 00:14:39.330
influential countries in globalization throughout the world,

289
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:42.390
a country with medieval structures that with a carefully trained focus on its

290
00:14:42.391 --> 00:14:45.960
natural charms and above all the invention of the gross national happiness index

291
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.730
have made it an epicenter of happiness,

292
00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.210
peace and cultural and environmental conservation in the collective imagination.

293
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:51.740
However,

294
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.400
the reality as so often happens as a little different from that of those.

295
00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:56.733
<v 0>Ed lanes.</v>

296
00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.810
<v 1>Yet in recent years, the country has embraced a democratic system.</v>

297
00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.140
Its economy has grown and its openness to the world is greater than ever before.

298
00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:08.830
And of course the thunder dragon kingdom is and will remain one of the most

299
00:15:08.831 --> 00:15:11.290
enigmatic and captivating places in the world.
