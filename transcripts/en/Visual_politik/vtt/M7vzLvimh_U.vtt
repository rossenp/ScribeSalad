00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.700
<v 0>This video is made possible by nor to VPN.</v>

2
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.260
<v 1>You really must be using a virtual private network.</v>

3
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.840
And that is where Nord VPN comes in. I know,

4
00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:14.420
I know it's tempting not to bother and hope for the best,

5
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.900
but really those stories you hear about people having their data stolen do

6
00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:20.810
happen. And you don't want to make it easy for anyone to do that.

7
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.470
But using a VPN offers more than just security. For example,

8
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.460
Nord VPN lets you access any of his thousands of servers in different countries,

9
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.220
all around the globe. So if you've had the end of your Netflix queue,

10
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.460
simply try changing the location of your server and get access to content

11
00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:37.910
libraries that due to licensing agreements are only available in specific

12
00:00:37.911 --> 00:00:39.860
geographic locations. For example,

13
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.890
most of European countries have strong licensing agreements restricting what

14
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.190
soccer matches can be viewed depending on the location of the viewer with Nord

15
00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:49.250
VPN, you can change your country without even moving from your.

16
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.620
<v 0>Sofa. Nord VPN.</v>

17
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.340
<v 1>Is super fast. So watching a video is a breeze, no lag whatsoever.</v>

18
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.070
If you've ever used a VPNs and thought they were slow, well,

19
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.290
no more with Nord VPN.

20
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.160
And you can use all of this on all your devices very, very easily.

21
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.620
It doesn't matter if it's Android Chrome windows, Linux.

22
00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:10.100
I don't have to six different devices on one account. Also,

23
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.990
there are no logs kept at all.

24
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.250
Unlike companies based in the EU or the U S nor the VPN is based in Panama.

25
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.370
So they don't have to keep logs at all, which as you can imagine,

26
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.840
it's great for your privacy.

27
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.690
So take control of your internet experience right now,

28
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.620

This special offer makes your subscription just $3 and 71 cents per month.

31
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.270
Anyway, now let's get into it.

32
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.283
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

33
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.833
<v 1>There's you'll pull a Migos.</v>

34
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.860
The Russian Federation is a country of stark contrasts. On the one hand,

35
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.030
the vast majority of its nearly 150 million inhabitants live and poverty,

36
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.240
but on the other it's one of the countries with the most international influence

37
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.760
mother, Russia is still a superpower.

38
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.360
It's an influence that of course does not come from its economic power.

39
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.380
After all its economy accounts for less than 2% of global GDP,

40
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.690
it does not have companies that are very relevant globally.

41
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.320
And to top it off its economic development over the past few years has been

42
00:02:21.321 --> 00:02:22.190
pretty negative.

43
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.580
So it's not in the economy that Russia anchors his political influence,

44
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.350
but rather through its military.

45
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.580
<v 0>Power, even though.</v>

46
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.220
<v 1>Trailing increasingly further behind the United States,</v>

47
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.910
Russia is still regarded as the second greatest military power on the face of

48
00:02:37.911 --> 00:02:41.540
the planet. Even today, it's only China that is threatening to bump it down.

49
00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:42.890
A spot in the world's rankings.

50
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.900
The Russian army has approximately 900,000 active soldiers and 2 million more

51
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.960
and reserve. I figured that while significantly reduced over the years,

52
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.430
especially given that the former Soviet union once maintained more than 4

53
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.860
million active troops remain supported by the world's largest arsenal of weapons

54
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.810
and some of the most advanced Intercontinental missiles in existence because

55
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.790
Russia is first and foremost,

56
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.300
a country forged horrendous nuclear arsenal and its armed forces.

57
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.170
To give you an idea.

58
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.800
Existing calculations suggest that this country still maintains an arsenal of

59
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:17.830
nearly 6,500 nuclear weapons today.

60
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.390
Friends as so often happens, numbers can be misleading.

61
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.600
And in the case of the Russian army, that kinda seems to be the case.

62
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.410
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

63
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.070
<v 1>As you will see,</v>

64
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.310
although the figures are rendered dimensions of their armed forces are pretty

65
00:03:35.311 --> 00:03:37.860
staggering. The Russians have one huge problem.

66
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.800
The antiquated condition of many of their weapons tanks,

67
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.890
submarines and other Soviet relics and open fighting.

68
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.050
If we had to pet the United States against Russia,

69
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.990
Putin's country would have a really bad time.

70
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.620
This is something that over the last few years has become an obsession for

71
00:03:52.621 --> 00:03:53.040
Moscow,

72
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.760
not least because the Russian military industry is a very important one for the

73
00:03:56.761 --> 00:04:00.090
entire country, for the country. And of course,

74
00:04:00.091 --> 00:04:03.030
for the pockets of many of its politicians, you know,

75
00:04:03.031 --> 00:04:05.220
how things work in these situations.

76
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.380
The fact is that the Russian military industry,

77
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.010
the second most important behind that of the United States is responsible for

78
00:04:11.011 --> 00:04:13.080
just over 2 million jobs,

79
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.400
which represents no more or less than 3% of the entire labor force and

80
00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:21.990
20% of all industrial jobs in the country with the exception of raw

81
00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:22.591
materials.

82
00:04:22.591 --> 00:04:26.040
The military industry is one of the main economic activities of the Russian

83
00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:30.000
Federation, as well as an important asset and international relations.

84
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.760
And all of that is precisely why in this video,

85
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.850
we are going to tell you what the Russian army is really like.

86
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.290
And also what plans Moscow has put in place to try and consolidate itself as the

87
00:04:40.291 --> 00:04:42.990
second military power, even above China.

88
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.380
So do you want to come with us to discover the strongest and at the same time

89
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.810
weakest part of mother Russia, if you do.

90
00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.630
<v 0>Great embarrassment before we start.</v>

91
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.370
<v 1>Talking about Russia's military equipment,</v>

92
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.730
we need to go back a little bit to understand how this story began.

93
00:05:05.731 --> 00:05:09.180
We have to go back to the years of the Soviet union. You see my friends,

94
00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:13.740
the U S S R the union of Soviet socialist republics was a very poor country

95
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.290
throughout its entire existence, a very poor country,

96
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.670
but with a huge industrial base and industrial base that because of the cold war

97
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.130
was prepared for war at all times,

98
00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.570
that is all Soviet factories had contingency plans to produce military weapons

99
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.530
and equipment if necessary. And that way throughout its existence,

100
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.100
the USSR was directed under what was clearly a war.

101
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.203
<v 0>Economy.</v>

102
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.420
<v 1>Let's take a look at some data or the time of its downfall.</v>

103
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.110
The Soviet giant had 4,000 military production and research facilities,

104
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.940
employing 6 million people and consuming nearly 50% of the entire central

105
00:05:50.941 --> 00:05:54.690
state budget. And that's right, 50% of the entire budget,

106
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.130
a complete more economy and economic system geared not so much for the wellbeing

107
00:05:58.131 --> 00:06:02.000
of its citizens, but for the annihilation of any potential adversary. However,

108
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.540
more than half of this huge military industrial power was lost as it had to

109
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:10.040
close during the great crisis arose after the disintegration of the USSR crisis,

110
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:14.510
in which Russia lost around 20% of its GDP between 1991 and

111
00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:15.680
1993.

112
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.380
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

113
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.740
<v 1>The crisis was so great and had so many repercussions for the Russian</v>

114
00:06:23.741 --> 00:06:24.341
Federation.

115
00:06:24.341 --> 00:06:29.260
Didn't manage to match the GDP at hand during the Soviet era until 2004.

116
00:06:29.261 --> 00:06:32.170
And alongside all this its military industry suffered.

117
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.060
What is basically an apocalypse,

118
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.560
nearly 70% of military companies disappeared and the sector lost more than three

119
00:06:38.561 --> 00:06:42.220
and a half million jobs, 60% of his workforce.

120
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.200
And that is not all in addition,

121
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.440
much of the production facilities stayed beyond Russia's new borders and

122
00:06:47.441 --> 00:06:50.980
countries that became completely independent after the dissolving of the Soviet

123
00:06:50.981 --> 00:06:52.720
union countries, such as U Korean,

124
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.560
which compromised a total of 15% of all Soviet industrial production.

125
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.340
Indeed this detail has been key a top priority and Russia's foreign policy.

126
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.940
Let me explain the military industrial complex was scattered across the Soviet

127
00:07:06.941 --> 00:07:07.510
geography.

128
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.590
The economic interdependence and disrespect was enormous so that when the USSR

129
00:07:11.591 --> 00:07:15.820
fell apart, Russia faced a two-fold problem. Firstly, as I have mentioned,

130
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.810
the crisis significantly, we can industrial capacity. And secondly,

131
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.680
it's remaining military production companies and its army relied heavily on

132
00:07:23.681 --> 00:07:25.000
supplies, technology,

133
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.150
and equipment that were known in the hands of other countries.

134
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.080
And this is largely what explains Russia's difficulty and maintaining fierce

135
00:07:32.081 --> 00:07:35.950
control over some of the former Soviet republics, such as Ukraine, but.

136
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:37.083
<v 0>Yes, carry on.</v>

137
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.000
<v 1>Constant investment to keep them up to date. However,</v>

138
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.230
after the fall of the USSR, Russia simply had no money left.

139
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.430
This is why Russian military spending in 1998 was one third of what it had been

140
00:07:51.431 --> 00:07:54.700
in 1992 military spending fell from almost

141
00:07:54.701 --> 00:07:58.720
48.7 billion to just over 16.2 billion.

142
00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:02.620
And as I'm sure you can imagine this budget reduction was accompanied by a total

143
00:08:02.621 --> 00:08:06.640
collapse and military production take note of this and the late 1990s Russian

144
00:08:06.641 --> 00:08:11.110
military production that counted for 10% of what be produced in 1991,

145
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:15.910
only 10% as disastrous. However, hold on just one moment,

146
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.450
because everything began to change with the arrival of the new millennium with

147
00:08:19.451 --> 00:08:20.430
the 21st century,

148
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.950
it came one of the great protagonists of international politics over the last

149
00:08:23.951 --> 00:08:28.540
two decades. I am of course, referring to who else, but Vladimir Putin,

150
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:32.350
the president that some already called the new SAR of mother Russia.

151
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:41.380
<v 0>Yep.</v>

152
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.240
<v 1>The thing is when Putin came to power,</v>

153
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:47.230
he found himself in a catastrophic situation in terms of the Russian armed

154
00:08:47.231 --> 00:08:50.890
forces. Only 20% of military equipment was relatively recent.

155
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.370
I eat only 20% of the gear was functional. And not only that,

156
00:08:54.371 --> 00:08:58.110
but the Army's to react and deploy forces was lower than ever.

157
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.520
These are problems that in many cases still persist today. Take for example,

158
00:09:02.521 --> 00:09:05.910
what happens to aircraft carriers? Well, at the beginning of the 21st century,

159
00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:09.540
the United States maintained the fleet of 14 of these ships dotted around the

160
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:11.520
globe. Russia barely had one.

161
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.910
And that one was far from top of the lane.

162
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.520
[inaudible] is an aircraft carrier from the final stages of the USSR with

163
00:09:25.521 --> 00:09:27.470
technology from the early 1980s.

164
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.270
But which due to various deficiencies was not fully operational until 1998,

165
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.990
but this is not the only example we can find of the Russian military habitually

166
00:09:35.991 --> 00:09:37.190
presenting better numbers.

167
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.700
And the reality another case can be found and his tank and venturing,

168
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.780
you see on paper, Russia has the largest fleet of tanks in the world.

169
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.740
According to estimates,

170
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:50.570
they have between 15,000 and 20,000 units and even higher amount than

171
00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:54.320
all of the natal countries combined. So what's the problem. The problem is,

172
00:09:54.321 --> 00:09:55.880
is that most of them are old,

173
00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:00.050
very old Russia continues to operate former Soviet tanks dating back for the

174
00:10:00.051 --> 00:10:01.880
1960s and seventies.

175
00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:05.600
As you can imagine,

176
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.810
this creates a lot of weaknesses that among other things has serious

177
00:10:08.811 --> 00:10:13.070
implications during the war or rather the attack on Georgia in 2008,

178
00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.310
You see the Georgian war was Russia's first open war after the fall of the

179
00:10:19.311 --> 00:10:20.030
Soviet union.

180
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.420
And it serves to test the effectiveness of his arguments and the capabilities of

181
00:10:23.421 --> 00:10:27.050
his army. And the truth is they failed the test, all sorts of problems,

182
00:10:27.051 --> 00:10:30.470
cropped up lack of coordination between military commands, lack of precision,

183
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:31.220
Reverend rate,

184
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:34.940
poor maintenance of military equipment and poor personnel instruction problems

185
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.020
that slowed grew breasts,

186
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:40.220
despite Russia's enormous superiority and the Russian army recorded many more

187
00:10:40.221 --> 00:10:41.780
problems and many more losses.

188
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:45.860
And it had estimated all of this was a huge headache for Moscow that was

189
00:10:45.861 --> 00:10:47.600
suddenly faced with a harsh reality.

190
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.320
Its armed forces did not correspond to those of a large superpower.

191
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:56.080
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

192
00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.690
<v 1>About this for one moment. If the invasion of a small country like Georgia,</v>

193
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.290
that didn't even bother to resist was wrought with a constant succession of

194
00:11:03.291 --> 00:11:05.210
mistakes and problems of all kinds,

195
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.180
what would happen and the event of a much larger operation.

196
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:11.600
Can you imagine what would have happened if the confrontation had been with

197
00:11:11.601 --> 00:11:12.434
natal troops?

198
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:17.640
<v 0>Well.</v>

199
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.720
<v 1>That was exactly the question that was asked and Moscow.</v>

200
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.990
And the response came shortly thereafter in 2011,

201
00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.890
when Vladimir Putin presented a comprehensive program to modernize the Russian

202
00:11:27.891 --> 00:11:31.640
armed forces, a goal that went on to become the highest national priority.

203
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.250
We are talking about the so-called SAP program,

204
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:39.170
a program that invested a gigantic investment of up to $650 billion to

205
00:11:39.171 --> 00:11:40.790
buy and develop new aircraft,

206
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.750
new tanks and especially submarines rockets and missiles.

207
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:48.410
Lots of missiles, all of this with the aim that by 2020,

208
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:52.550
at least 70% of its military systems could be considered advanced and fully

209
00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:56.620
operational. But as naysayers will insist that this is in fact 2020,

210
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.480
what results has this plan achieved?

211
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:02.410
Has the Russian army improved substantially over the last 25 years? Well.

212
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.370
<v 0>Stumbling block.</v>

213
00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.580
<v 1>If there has been one event that has disrupted the plan of modernization of the</v>

214
00:12:14.581 --> 00:12:19.080
Russian army as clearly being the Ukrainian war and the annexation of Crimea,

215
00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.060
as we have covered in previous videos,

216
00:12:21.061 --> 00:12:25.500
this military action resulted in harsh sanctions for Russia from the United

217
00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.830
States and many other Western countries sanctions that brought the Russian

218
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.670
military industry and to focus what's more the fact that Ukrainian government

219
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.550
emerging from the Euromaidan and opposition to Russian control,

220
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:39.630
managed to endure has caused Moscow to lose direct access to some of its major

221
00:12:39.631 --> 00:12:40.464
military supply.

222
00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:41.483
<v 0>Yes.</v>

223
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.660
<v 1>For example, aircraft manufacturer,</v>

224
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.930
Antonov now Ukrainian state owned company had agreements with the Russian

225
00:12:48.931 --> 00:12:52.560
defense ministry to provide them with a new eight and 70 an eight and one,

226
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.230
two for military transport aircraft. Not only that,

227
00:12:55.231 --> 00:12:58.590
but significant engine supply contracts were also underway for new Russian

228
00:12:58.591 --> 00:13:02.310
aircraft and helicopters from the Russian manufacturers, mill and camo,

229
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:04.980
as well as some from Yan CoLab. In addition to all this,

230
00:13:04.981 --> 00:13:08.820
because I'm very important contracts for the supply of components and technology

231
00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:12.570
for the Russian frigate to modernization program also fell through and seriously

232
00:13:12.571 --> 00:13:13.980
disrupted Moscow's plants.

233
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:17.850
The greatest example is in the manufacturer of the new Admiral Gira Trav class

234
00:13:17.851 --> 00:13:21.180
frigates whose gas turbines were manufacturers by the Ukrainian company,

235
00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:22.380
Zuora mush.

236
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.213
<v 0>Okay.</v>

237
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.400
<v 1>As you can imagine,</v>

238
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:29.040
all these contracts were suspended by the Ukrainian government,

239
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:29.970
after the invasion,

240
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.540
forcing Russia to seek alternative local or Russia friendly suppliers.

241
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.220
This is no easy feat,

242
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.700
both for the level of development or by coupling and technological

243
00:13:38.701 --> 00:13:39.534
compatibility.

244
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.420
And that's not all following the events in Ukraine and the subsequent

245
00:13:45.421 --> 00:13:46.500
international sanctions,

246
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.700
the United States and many ally countries halted the sale of Julius electronic

247
00:13:50.701 --> 00:13:52.680
components, both civilian and military,

248
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.220
such as special glass and steel that were used to manufacture Russian weapons

249
00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:01.080
and satellites. And for which Moscow spent about $500 million each year.

250
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:05.460
But given all the obstacles less focused on the results achieved and the weapons

251
00:14:05.461 --> 00:14:09.720
systems Russia currently hunts the situation is such that despite the enormous

252
00:14:09.721 --> 00:14:14.190
efforts made the problems still persist and an estimated 50% of grinned forces

253
00:14:14.191 --> 00:14:17.040
can be considered to be modern. Take, for example,

254
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.790
the case of the Russian T 14 Armata tanks, the crown jewel,

255
00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:24.210
and one of the steps considered key to modernizing their ground forces.

256
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.770
Initially Russia was planning to equip itself with 2,300 tanks of this tape by

257
00:14:28.771 --> 00:14:32.430
2025. However, the budget has been so diluted that in the end,

258
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:37.200
these 2,300 tanks have in fact only resulted in 132.

259
00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.190
Do you thought the situation has seemed to grim in the post-Soviet crises we

260
00:14:44.191 --> 00:14:47.460
described earlier, Russia is currently in the middle of a double crisis,

261
00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.860
an economic and monetary crisis. For example,

262
00:14:49.861 --> 00:14:53.480
the ruble has devalued 60% against the dollar over the last decade.

263
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.000
And then there is a second diplomatic crisis.

264
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:59.900
One that we have told you has greatly restricted Russia's access to key markets

265
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.420
necessary for modernizing its military sector.

266
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.200
However, in spite of everything,

267
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.720
and even though the objectives may have not been fully met,

268
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:13.550
the truth is that the period of 2011 to 2020 has been the stage of the greatest

269
00:15:13.551 --> 00:15:16.550
military modernization since the fall of the Soviet union.

270
00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.140
Of course of the last decade,

271
00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:26.410
we have seen how the Russian air force has incorporated nearly 100.

272
00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.150
Sukhoi asked to use 35,

273
00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:31.420
their most advanced fighter with specifications close to the most recent

274
00:15:31.421 --> 00:15:33.760
American and European fighters. In addition,

275
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:38.350
the old Soviet Tupolev one sex or nuclear capable bombers are being upgraded to

276
00:15:38.351 --> 00:15:42.640
create the T U one sex or an variant from which Russia seeks to incorporate 10

277
00:15:42.641 --> 00:15:46.030
units. Then on the Marine side, which is where the Russians are weakest.

278
00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.930
The program has given absolute priority to boring class nuclear capable,

279
00:15:49.931 --> 00:15:54.220
submarines submarines with 16 missile launchers capable of carrying six nuclear

280
00:15:54.221 --> 00:15:55.810
warheads. Each my friends,

281
00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.470
the cost of building equipping and assembling just one of these submarines,

282
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:04.300
it's close to $1 billion. They are the new crown jewel of the Russian arsenal.

283
00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.980
And at the time of making this video,

284
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.100
there were already four vessels of this tape, sealing the seas.

285
00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.010
And so we could continue with many more types of equipment.

286
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.640
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

287
00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.960
<v 1>The SAP program has not been completed,</v>

288
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.710
but despite this elite and modern equipment for the Russian armed forces is

289
00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:24.760
undeniable.

290
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:28.660
But having said that there was one key issue that could influence the future of

291
00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:30.010
all these plants.

292
00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.970
And what I mean is the military capability of an army has a lot to do with its

293
00:16:33.971 --> 00:16:36.880
industrial capacity. And today for countries like Russia,

294
00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:41.470
its international influence is linked to his ability to manufacture and sell

295
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.940
modern military equipment.

296
00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:46.570
This becomes even more critical if the country is going through a structural

297
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.740
economic crisis.

298
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:51.880
So the burning question is where is the real problem with a Russian military

299
00:16:51.881 --> 00:16:53.530
industry? Well, to be specific,

300
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.350
the biggest weakness lies and its enormous inefficiency.

301
00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:01.180
<v 0>Russia.</v>

302
00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.900
<v 1>Industry is first and foremost, a state driven and state run industry.</v>

303
00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.550
And that is causing a lot of problems such as slow technological development,

304
00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:13.270
which can leave it behind not only the United States, but also China.

305
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.060
So let's look at an example that illustrates what we're talking about.

306
00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:18.070
Take the case of the Russian military company,

307
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:22.690
rustic Ross tech as a company that builds just over $25 billion and has

308
00:17:22.691 --> 00:17:25.060
529,000 employees.

309
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:29.500
It's North American rival the U S Lockheed Martin has 105,000 employees,

310
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:34.150
five times fewer yet at generates more than $53.7 billion in

311
00:17:34.151 --> 00:17:35.920
revenue or nearly twice as much.

312
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:36.993
<v 0>Rustic.</v>

313
00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.780
<v 1>I'm wondering, but grant, is that really bad?</v>

314
00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:44.223
<v 0>Potent?</v>

315
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:51.060
<v 1>Well, let's say it is a sane. Russian are huge corporations,</v>

316
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:54.570
very bureaucratic and complicated that have the dual mission of not only

317
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:55.980
developing military equipment,

318
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:59.880
but also like every public enterprise of employing as many people as possible

319
00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:00.743
throughout the land.

320
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.350
Also adding to its sluggishness is the fact that resources are scarce because

321
00:18:04.351 --> 00:18:07.650
just imagine how much gets chewed up by a payroll of that size.

322
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.650
Obviously the ability to retain the best talent is quite low.

323
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:15.510
This intern generates a very significant technological gap and remember the arms

324
00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:19.500
market is not very different from any other competitiveness and innovation are

325
00:18:19.501 --> 00:18:20.334
key. Well,

326
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:25.050
the fact is that these problems and the shortfalls of the 2011 to 2020 plan is

327
00:18:25.051 --> 00:18:28.680
what has led Putin to announce a new plan with almost an identical budget.

328
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:32.550
The 2018, 2027 state armament plan. However,

329
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:36.300
unlike in 2011, the state's resources are much more limited.

330
00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:37.483
<v 0>To date.</v>

331
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.790
<v 1>As you can see during the era of leather mule Putin,</v>

332
00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:47.990
the Russian armed forces have experienced a huge make-over nevertheless,

333
00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:51.200
they still have three major problems facing them today. Firstly,

334
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:54.620
the equipment is still largely outdated and ill-equipped beyond the big programs

335
00:18:54.621 --> 00:18:57.560
that the Russian government showcases in a grand way and reality,

336
00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:00.530
the advances overall are not so great. Secondly,

337
00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.280
Russia's military industry remains inefficient very bureaucratic and

338
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.143
complicated.

339
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:08.600
They are no longer just challenging and competing with us military companies,

340
00:19:08.601 --> 00:19:12.290
but also with new players in the game like China and thirdly,

341
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.760
the country's structural economic crisis raises serious doubts about his ability

342
00:19:16.761 --> 00:19:21.320
to continue financing the updating and operation of its armed forces. And yet,

343
00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.520
despite all of this,

344
00:19:22.521 --> 00:19:25.790
the efforts of Latin mere Putin's government so far have caused Russia to

345
00:19:25.791 --> 00:19:27.860
maintain its status as a superpower.

346
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:30.890
Something that in the late nineties was in serious dent,

347
00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.120
but now it's over to you.

348
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.960
Do you think Russia is as strong and fearsome as Moscow propaganda would have us

349
00:19:35.961 --> 00:19:39.440
believe and how long after I finished recording this? Well, I wind up dead.

350
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.050
