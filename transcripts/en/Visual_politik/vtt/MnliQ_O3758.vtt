00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.470
<v 0>Over the last five decades,</v>

2
00:00:01.471 --> 00:00:04.110
the Brazilian economy has been on a virtual roller coaster.

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.610
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

4
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.480
<v 0>Periods of strong economic growth and high expectations have been followed by</v>

5
00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:14.690
crises, devaluations and even hyperinflation.

6
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.380
This is what happened in the late 1980s, for example, in 1918, 19,

7
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.890
the Brazil experienced 1320% inflation.

8
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.100
And in 1990 2740%.

9
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.023
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.620
<v 0>Is that 50 years after experiencing what became known as the Brazilian miracle,</v>

11
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.080
Brazil has still not managed to take the leap forward.

12
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.830
It needs to become a developed country. Still over the past few decades,

13
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.670
Brazil has attracted investment for many companies and in many financial

14
00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:53.230
circles,

15
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.390
it has come to be considered one of the great hopes among American economies.

16
00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.720
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

17
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.180
<v 0>Have you ever heard of the bricks? I'm sure you have.</v>

18
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.830
So why have we chosen to talk about Brazil and this new collaboration with value

19
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.993
school?

20
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.590
<v 1>Well.</v>

21
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.790
<v 0>We have done this firstly,</v>

22
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.410
to find out when and why the Brazilian economy became so popular. And secondly,

23
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.380
because we want to answer three key questions. Firstly,

24
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.430
can stock markets help small investors protect themselves from periods of crisis

25
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.300
political upheaval and the processes of high inflation and even hyperinflation

26
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.430
that are so common in many American countries.

27
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.910
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

28
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.840
<v 0>Secondly, what does the case of Brazil tell us about all that?</v>

29
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.983
<v 1>Yes.</v>

30
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.100
<v 0>Can the case of Brazil teaches anything about how to best apply the processes of</v>

31
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.670
economic reform? We will try to answer all these questions, but first,

32
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.550
the first thing we have to do is find out where the story begins,

33
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.150
the origin of this particular rollercoaster that we see today before we get

34
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:53.900
started, though,

35
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.570
I just wanted to remind you about our new channel visual Academy.

36
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.170
It covers all the most interesting people, places and periods in history.

37
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.990
Do you want to know more about gangs Cannes or the ancient Greeks,

38
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.590
or maybe even the Vikings? Of course you do lose our cool teams in history.

00:02:13.911 --> 00:02:16.100
YouTube. Uh, no, let's go.

42
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.450
<v 1>Brazil's economic miracle.</v>

43
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.900
<v 0>Period from the end of the 1960s to the end of the 1970s has come to be known as</v>

44
00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:30.110
Brazil's economic miracle. Although, as we will see,

45
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.850
it was not really a miracle at time.

46
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.953
<v 1>All.</v>

47
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.910
<v 0>You're talking about a complex difficult period,</v>

48
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.040
a period marked by a military dictatorship,

49
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.820
repression and persecution of any political and social movement that was not

50
00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:46.100
properly aligned with military bodies and poets.

51
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.180
<v 1>Hello.</v>

52
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.280
<v 0>In spite of everything during those years,</v>

53
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.370
the economy also registered enormous economic growth.

54
00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.040
These are known as the years have led to give you an idea in 19 eight Brazil's

55
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.670
GDP was growing at 9.8%. And by 1973,

56
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.340
this group reaching an astonishing 14%,

57
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.030
however,

58
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.210
beyond the economic growth that the country registered during the first years of

59
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:17.050
the dictatorship, the truth is that the basis for this growth are not the best.

60
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.520
The military government stimulated,

61
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:21.880
the arrival of foreign capital and measures were implemented to protect

62
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:22.900
financial investments,

63
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.190
but they also bet on stimulating internal demand through the execution of large

64
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.180
infrastructure works.

65
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.690
We are talking about projects such as the EDP mega hydroelectric plant,

66
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.990
the trauma Amazonian highway and the Angora nuclear power plant,

67
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.580
all financed with public money and debt. What's more in 1964,

68
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.620
the military created the central bank of Brazil,

69
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.980
which they did not hesitate in using to finance their enormous public works

70
00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:45.580
projects.

71
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.260
As a result during the military rain Brazil's foreign debt multiplied by 30 and

72
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:54.280
inflation grew and exceeded 34% in 1974.

73
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.140
So when the first oil crisis broke out in 1973,

74
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.110
crude oil quadrupled in price at the exact same time,

75
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.270
the international credit became scarce.

76
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.440
That's when the Brazilian economy began to have problems in just two years,

77
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.380
GDP growth was reduced by 10 points. Despite this,

78
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.680
the military government decided to continue with its huge public spending plans

79
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.120
to try and boost the economy

80
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.040
and that that only made the economy even more vulnerable. So in 1979,

81
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:26.500
when a new oil crisis full of the Iranian revolution,

82
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.840
Brazil's economy faced another severe blow

83
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.880
economic growth, practically disappeared.

84
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.670
It's simply vanished and come from rural materials plummeted.

85
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.210
The foreign debt had to be renegotiated to ever higher and higher interest

86
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:40.570
rates.

87
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.260
And the government accounts no longer added up either above or below the lane,

88
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.540
not on one site nor on the other,

89
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.480
the Brazilian economy was headed for disaster.

90
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.260
That pretty much described exactly what happened,

91
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.740
unable to resort to foreign credit and with a growing imbalance in public

92
00:04:59.741 --> 00:05:02.920
accounts, the government turned to the central bank for financing.

93
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.770
My friends that was the beginning of the end

94
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.490
inflation soon exceeded 100% per year and various attempts to stabilize the

95
00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:14.710
situation did not work. And the end,

96
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.000
the economic crisis itself led to the fall of the military government in 1985.

97
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.040
Of course the advent of democracy did not bring prosperity either. In 1987,

98
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.670
the Brazilian government suspended their loan payments and between 1989 and

99
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:37.270
1993, the country practically lived under constant hyperinflation.

100
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.613
Check this out.

101
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.470
<v 2>When I was 10 year old in the 1980s in Brazil,</v>

102
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.910
my job was to run through the supermarket aisles to pass adults who aren't with

103
00:05:47.911 --> 00:05:50.970
the labeling machines. So large that they made us laugh,

104
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.420
wandered around the place raising prices throughout the day.

105
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.950
Rodrigo side-on professor of economics and finance.

106
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.170
<v 1>At the New York university in Shanghai.</v>

107
00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.410
<v 0>At the same time during the first three years of the 1990s,</v>

108
00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.080
the GDP per capita plummeted by 10%.

109
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.700
And so we arrived at 1994 the year in which was perhaps being the most

110
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.100
ambitious plan for reform in Brazil's history.

111
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.750
<v 1>Was launched the real plan.</v>

112
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.690
<v 0>The real blend initiated by Fernando Henrico Cardoso first as minister of</v>

113
00:06:25.691 --> 00:06:29.170
finance and later as president of Brazil aims to go much further.

114
00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.990
<v 1>Cardoso.</v>

115
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.410
<v 0>His plan sought to completely transform the reality of the Brazilian economy by</v>

116
00:06:35.411 --> 00:06:37.900
means of the privatization of the public sector,

117
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.010
financial system reforms attracting foreign investment and the opening up of the

118
00:06:42.011 --> 00:06:44.380
Brazilian economy to the world through mercury, sir.

119
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.070
But the first task was undoubtedly to contain the wild hyperinflation.

120
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.120
The country was suffering

121
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.200
And an attempt to achieve price stability.

122
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.440
The government launched a rapid action program that aims to end the budget tree

123
00:06:56.441 --> 00:06:57.850
and balance and the public accounts.

124
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.180
And immediately afterwards established a new monetary standard,

125
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.410
the real value unit,

126
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.100
the value of which was linked to the U S dollar and which was assigned affects

127
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:07.630
daily rate and the central bank,

128
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.310
little by little wages rates and prices recorded using this new value unit.

129
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.740
And finally, on the 1st of June, 1994,

130
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.550
the real value unit became the new currency of Brazil commonly referred to as

131
00:07:18.551 --> 00:07:22.030
the reality. You know,

132
00:07:22.031 --> 00:07:24.550
what the effects on inflation were immediate?

133
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.270
Well during the first two financial quarters of 1994 inflation registered,

134
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.670
or an average increase of weight for it,

135
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.880
more than 40% per month after the introduction of the reality,

136
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.600
this was reduced to just over 3% during the second half of the year,

137
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.600
inflation gradually declined until 1998.

138
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.800
When it registered an annual increase of only 2.6%, take a look.

139
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:47.980
<v 1>So.</v>

140
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.390
<v 0>First objective achieved.</v>

141
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.990
The next goal was to restructure and recapitalize the entire financial system,

142
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.380
an operation that was led by the state itself through poor the program to

143
00:07:56.381 --> 00:07:59.980
stimulate the restructuring and strengthening of the national financial system.

144
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.040
This was a program where the government intervened and financial entities that

145
00:08:06.041 --> 00:08:09.070
presented problems. These entities were then given credit facilities.

146
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.560
The state bought the unpaid loans they had on their balance sheets,

147
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:15.490
and finally sold the entities in many cases to large international banking

148
00:08:15.491 --> 00:08:16.324
groups

149
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.240
Between 1994 and July and December in 1998,

150
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.730
76 banks were liquidated or transparent.

151
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.780
It was at precisely this time that both Banco Santander and then BBV

152
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.860
[inaudible] entered Brazil through the purchase of Brazilian banks that had been

153
00:08:32.861 --> 00:08:36.100
the objects of the government intervention so far. So good.

154
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.200
The fact is that after inflation was brought under control and the financial

155
00:08:41.201 --> 00:08:44.950
restructuring and privatization programs of public enterprises have begun local

156
00:08:44.951 --> 00:08:48.460
conditions in the eyes of international investors, improved significantly,

157
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.330
suddenly Brazil became fashionable and foreign capital began to pour into the

158
00:08:52.331 --> 00:08:54.250
country. For example, Telefonica,

159
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.740
a Spanish operator is the largest operator in Brazil today entered the country

160
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:01.380
in 1998 with the purchase of the public company.

161
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.110
Tell step to give you an idea of the scale of this move.

162
00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.230
It is estimated that between 1993 and 1998,

163
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.040
the Brazilian government raised a total of 68 billion from the sale of public

164
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:15.810
companies. That's billion dollars with a B. Well,

165
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.410
at that time, everything seems to be going smoothly. However, the truth was,

166
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.770
and the Brazilian roller coaster students started up again, the question is,

167
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:27.090
would things turn out differently for Brazil this time to find it,

168
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:28.643
listen up.

169
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.700
<v 1>All paths lead to here.</v>

170
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.530
<v 0>Everything seemed to be going smoothly and at full speed, however,</v>

171
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.110
little by little things go on, more complicated.

172
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.200
And the first place the plan had the initial objective of improving public

173
00:09:42.201 --> 00:09:45.380
accounts. But what happened was actually the opposite.

174
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:49.940
The new social commitments brought about by democracy,

175
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.850
the growing weight of the pension system and financial restructuring,

176
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.100
all triggered public debt. To give you an idea,

177
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:59.600
the financial reform alone cost the public coffers around $100 billion.

178
00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:02.740
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

179
00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.320
<v 0>Not only that since one of the government's objectives to boost economic growth</v>

180
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:07.730
was to attract foreign capital.

181
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.460
It maintained the policy of very high interest rates,

182
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.070
which greatly increased the cost of that public debt.

183
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:17.840
This in turn forced the state to SU large amounts of debt in order to finance

184
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:18.703
itself.

185
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.840
<v 1>Thus.</v>

186
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.110
<v 0>An only four years between 1994 and 1998,</v>

187
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.130
the Brazilian public debt increased threefold or the public deficit claims to

188
00:10:28.131 --> 00:10:30.350
7.4% of the fixed GDP.

189
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.223
<v 1>And this.</v>

190
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.690
<v 0>This leads us directly to the second problem.</v>

191
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.170
The combination of high interest rates with huge issuances of public debt

192
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:41.990
greeted what is known as crowding out a massive.

193
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.273
<v 1>The savings.</v>

194
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.340
<v 0>Resilience and the huge influx of foreign capital were mainly directed to the</v>

195
00:10:49.341 --> 00:10:51.080
purchase of public debt after all.

196
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:54.470
Why take risks with other investments when you can simply buy government debt

197
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:55.850
and get a huge return.

198
00:10:58.820 --> 00:10:58.910
<v 1>This.</v>

199
00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:00.890
<v 0>Crowding out phenomenon was so great,</v>

200
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.160
but despite the enormous amount of capital Brazil received from the rest of the

201
00:11:04.161 --> 00:11:07.550
world, companies found it increasingly difficult to obtain credit.

202
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.350
And not only that many of the countries,

203
00:11:09.351 --> 00:11:12.830
large companies began to direct the resources towards the purchase of public

204
00:11:12.831 --> 00:11:16.910
debt to at that time buying government securities was more profitable than

205
00:11:16.911 --> 00:11:18.980
reinvesting in their own businesses.

206
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.620
<v 1>This may seem incredible.</v>

207
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:25.940
<v 0>But to a large extent, this is what explains why between 1993 and 2003,</v>

208
00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:29.480
the rate of return for the 500 largest Brazilian companies was to increase by

209
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:33.920
80% while their investment only increased by 3.8% per year.

210
00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:37.010
The search for easy and apparently secure rents drove capital,

211
00:11:37.011 --> 00:11:38.600
not towards new investment projects,

212
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.970
but basically towards the purchase of public debt,

213
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:44.930
a textbook case of what is known in economics as the crowding out effect

214
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:47.570
And the end,

215
00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:51.380
the opening up to the outside world together with a lack of concrete measures to

216
00:11:51.381 --> 00:11:55.630
boost the competitiveness of local only added to this crowding out effect and an

217
00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:56.291
exchange rate.

218
00:11:56.291 --> 00:12:00.040
And flitted by a policy of high interest rates caused the bank account balance

219
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.470
to reverse and enter negative territory.

220
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.830
The result was that foreign debt began to grow again.

221
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.083
<v 1>And then.</v>

222
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.370
<v 0>Along came 1998,</v>

223
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.670
the year of both the Russian crisis and the Asian crisis.

224
00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:18.960
These crises made foreign capital begin to flow out of the emerging economies at

225
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:23.250
Phillips 1999.

226
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.150
The Brazilian economy had to be rescued the IMF together with the world bank,

227
00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:28.650
the Inter-American development bank,

228
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:32.100
and several countries that offered to be part of the rescue group had to put in

229
00:12:32.101 --> 00:12:34.350
more than $40 billion on the table,

230
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:37.561
Even.

231
00:12:37.561 --> 00:12:40.680
So when the central bank of Brazil was forced to let their Brazilian rail flow

232
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.350
freely, the currency lost more than 60% of its fine.

233
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:47.160
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

234
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.990
<v 0>The rollercoaster was ruling again.</v>

235
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:53.250
That was until the next commodity boom between 2000 and 2014.

236
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:57.540
And soon after another huge crisis from which the country has still not

237
00:12:57.541 --> 00:13:01.500
recovered. The Brazilian economy has really had its ups and downs,

238
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:07.320
But at this point, I'm sure many of you were thinking, well, grant,

239
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.900
if this video was made in collaboration with value school,

240
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.050
you must be about to tell us what happened with the stock market.

241
00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:16.620
So just what on earth did happen to the financial markets during this time?

242
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:16.980
Well,

243
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:20.430
the truth is the Brazilian stock market followed practically the same steps as

244
00:13:20.431 --> 00:13:24.510
the national economy and especially those of foreign capital flows into the.

245
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:27.660
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

246
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.830
<v 0>As you can see in this graph.</v>

247
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.640
And just two and a half years between the beginning of 1995 and the middle of

248
00:13:32.641 --> 00:13:37.170
1997, the BOVESPA index of the Brazilian stock market increased by a factor.

249
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:37.410
Okay.

250
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:38.243
<v 1>Three.</v>

251
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:43.830
<v 0>In any case, the most surprising fact is that during the last 50 years,</v>

252
00:13:43.831 --> 00:13:46.080
and in spite of all the ups and downs crises,

253
00:13:46.081 --> 00:13:49.380
and hyperinflations that Brazil has experienced the Brazilian stock market has

254
00:13:49.381 --> 00:13:53.520
reached a real return that is corrected for inflation of 6.7%

255
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:56.040
to illustrate this better.

256
00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:59.820
Let's take the case of two hypothetical investors who in 1968,

257
00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.970
we've invested the equivalent of 100 RIAs and today's money.

258
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:06.270
Let's say the first investor invested has money and bank deposits. Well,

259
00:14:06.271 --> 00:14:10.980
the second invested in exchange traded fund or ETF index to Bovis BOVESPA well,

260
00:14:10.981 --> 00:14:13.560
the D the first one would have absolutely nothing. Well,

261
00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:17.340
the second one would have investments worth $2,573,

262
00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:20.460
I guess that proves the power of equities and shorts.

263
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.830
This is the story of how Brazil became fashionable,

264
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.710
how it defeated hyperinflation and how the roller coaster returned.

265
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:30.420
In spite of everything with this story,

266
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.310
we wanted to put two ideas on the table.

267
00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:36.150
The first is that you have to be very careful with trends and with reform

268
00:14:36.151 --> 00:14:38.880
processes. They are not always the panacea this into B.

269
00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:42.510
If they are not well mapped out, the results can be very disappointing.

270
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:46.440
The second is that despite everything investing in equities was the best way for

271
00:14:46.441 --> 00:14:48.480
Brazilians to protect their long-term savings.

272
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:52.010
<v 1>Now, you understand.</v>

273
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.430
<v 0>Better why the mission of our friends over at value school is precisely to</v>

274
00:14:55.431 --> 00:14:58.640
promote financial culture. So we really hope you've enjoyed this video.
