00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.563
<v 0>[Inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.770
you ready to go to work

3
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.070
on August 11th, 2020?

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.070
There are just over 80 days until the U S elections will be held.

5
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.110
And when democratic candidate Juul Biden,

6
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.590
I noticed the name of the person accompanying him on his election tickets.

7
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.270
<v 1>I have the great honor to announce that I've picked Kamala Harris,</v>

8
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.480
a fearless fighter for the little guy at one of the country's finest public

9
00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:35.270
servants. As my running mate, Joe Biden on Twitter.

10
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.000
<v 0>And as the announcement is made the Republican party,</v>

11
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.120
or at least president Trump's political machine opened fire.

12
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.980
<v 1>Kamala Harris is election has completed the takeover of the party by the extreme</v>

13
00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:50.210
left wing and its radical agenda. Marsha Blackburn Senator for Tennessee,

14
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.950
Joe Biden is no moderate. And with Harris and his political living well,

15
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.610
he is surrendering control of our nation to the radical mob with promises to

16
00:00:58.611 --> 00:01:01.280
raise taxes, not to police funding, Hill energy jobs,

17
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.850
open our borders and appease socialistic, taters, Katrina Pierson,

18
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.460
the Trump campaign's 2020 senior advisor,

19
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.240
Joe Biden's decision to add Kamala Harris to the tickets,

20
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.060
confirms everything president Trump and I have been saying,

21
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.840
and that is that Joe Biden and the democratic party have been overtaken by the

22
00:01:17.841 --> 00:01:21.350
radical left. Mike Pence, vice president of the United States.

23
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.970
<v 2>She is a disaster. She's going to be a disaster, I think for their party.</v>

24
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.340
I agree with you. I believe Congress should act. I agree.

25
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.050
I heard actually she's the most liberal person in all of Congress.

26
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.350
That's what I've heard more liberal than Bernie Sanders. Believe it or not.

27
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.370
<v 3>I give credit to Bernie Sanders for starting a very important discussion,</v>

28
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.150
but it became clear to me that we could do better. And so my Medicare,

29
00:01:44.151 --> 00:01:45.020
for all plan,

30
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.970
it allows Americans to have choice between a Medicare for all public plan

31
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.250
or a Medicare for all private plan.

32
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.080
Cause I heard from people they want to have choice.

33
00:01:54.081 --> 00:01:55.880
They don't want private plans to be excluded.

34
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.590
<v 2>She was very, very nasty.</v>

35
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.100
She was extraordinarily nasty to Kevin.

36
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.160
Archie was the meanest

37
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.310
the most horrible most disrespectful? No, it's actually a question.

38
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.590
<v 0>So my visual politic nerd is the strategy of Republicans.</v>

39
00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:19.940
Following the election of Kamala.

40
00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:24.470
Harris has been clear to point her out as a radical left-wing candidate. Oh,

41
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.330
knew a person from the most extremely socialist recesses of the democratic party

42
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.690
faced with this approach. However, media outlets such as the New York times,

43
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:36.710
the Los Angeles times and the ABC have painted her as quite the opposite as a

44
00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:40.430
centrist and moderate candidate and impression that according to the polls is

45
00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:41.900
the same one that the voters have.

46
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.850
<v 1>Voters see Harris as more moderate than Trump or Pence morning consult.</v>

47
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.930
<v 0>And that is not all political analysis groups found that Harris's withdrawal</v>

48
00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:54.230
from the democratic primary was largely due to the lack of enthusiasm.

49
00:02:54.231 --> 00:02:57.470
Her candidacy generated among the parties extreme left wing,

50
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.820
and a primary race loaded with moderate candidates, speeding.

51
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.990
<v 4>To the Pueblo and out of a love for all people. I hear by second,</v>

52
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:08.590
the nomination of Senator Bernard Sanders of Vermont.

53
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.850
<v 0>Questions we are asking today are what is really behind all of this.</v>

54
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.080
What point of view is closest to reality and take notes because the answers to

55
00:03:16.081 --> 00:03:19.950
these questions are particularly important when you consider things like this.

56
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.690
<v 1>Biden plans to make Harris as powerful a Veep as he was under Obama,</v>

57
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.920
democratic nominee was one of the most impactful vice presidents ever or in

58
00:03:28.921 --> 00:03:29.754
policy.

59
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.130
<v 0>So my political aficionados, who exactly as Kamala Harris,</v>

60
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.320
why did Biden choose her as his running mate?

61
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.450
What applications could it have for the future?

62
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.410
Are we looking at a future female president of the United States and the most

63
00:03:43.411 --> 00:03:45.090
important question of all,

64
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.630
what exactly does the person who might be in charge of one of the most important

65
00:03:48.631 --> 00:03:53.370
vice presidencies and the history of American democracy stand for in this video,

66
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.180
we are going to answer all of those questions and we will do so specifically by

67
00:03:57.181 --> 00:04:00.840
taking a look at the political work that this candidate has done so far.

68
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:01.800
And I'll tell you know,

69
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.400
that we are going to come across a little bit of everything, but first,

70
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.820
first we have to see exactly who Kamala Harris is.

71
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.713
<v 5>So listen to</v>

72
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.290
an American story.

73
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.430
<v 0>California and Senator and former attorney general of the same state Harris as a</v>

74
00:04:23.431 --> 00:04:26.280
stalwart fan of converse sneakers. Of course,

75
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.250
that is not our most American feature. My friends Kamala Harris,

76
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.820
his personal profile is something of a mixed bank made up of many of the

77
00:04:32.821 --> 00:04:36.210
attributes that embody contemporary society. And in particular,

78
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.250
the one known as the American dream Harris is a perfect representative of

79
00:04:41.251 --> 00:04:45.360
the multi-racial multi-ethnic and multicultural currents that shaped much of

80
00:04:45.361 --> 00:04:48.120
American society today. And Joe Biden's words,

81
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.620
her story is the story of America. Now just one moment,

82
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.360
let's actually look at that story

83
00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.770
Because Kamala Harris was born in 1964 and the California city of Oakland

84
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.760
as city located in the San Francisco Bay area that has become a melting pot of

85
00:05:05.761 --> 00:05:09.870
ethnic minorities. Only 20% of its inhabitants are white Americans.

86
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.800
The fact is Kamala Harris is the biracial daughter of a couple of newly arrived

87
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.690
immigrants, her father Jamaican,

88
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.440
and her mother Indian two immigrants who came to the country when very young and

89
00:05:19.441 --> 00:05:21.780
over the years became very successful.

90
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.500
Her father ended up teaching economics at Stanford and her mother worked as a

91
00:05:25.501 --> 00:05:27.300
cancer researcher. Not only that,

92
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.960
they also actively participated in the civil rights movement led by Martin

93
00:05:30.961 --> 00:05:31.650
Luther King.

94
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.890
That was the environment in which the second vice presidential candidate was

95
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:38.460
raised. But that is not all after her presidents divorced,

96
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.670
Kamala spent her teenage years and Montreal and later attended Howard

97
00:05:41.671 --> 00:05:45.210
university, a historically black institution and Washington DC.

98
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.230
Soon after she returned to California and began her legal career fighting crime,

99
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.310
a career that led her to be elected as San Francisco district attorney in 2004

100
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.000
and later in the 2010 election as California state attorney,

101
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.370
she was reelected to this position in 2014 and ended up being elected to the

102
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:05.690
Senate and the 2016 election. Okay.

103
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.930
So in a nutshell, an African-American Indian daughter of immigrants,

104
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.190
a poster child for social mobility and married to a white man of Jewish faith to

105
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:16.100
top it all off. She is a Democrat who has built her career.

106
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.120
I run the fight against crime and as a and supporter of the Israeli state.

107
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.310
<v 3>I stand with Israel because of our shared values,</v>

108
00:06:24.311 --> 00:06:28.150
which are so fundamental to the founding of both our nations.

109
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.520
And as long as I'm a United States, Senator,

110
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.380
I will do everything in my power to ensure broad and

111
00:06:35.381 --> 00:06:39.790
bi-partisan support for Israel security and right to self-defense.

112
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.620
<v 0>You might be thinking here,</v>

113
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.370
if we had to design from scratch the profile of a candidate for a contemporary

114
00:06:45.371 --> 00:06:49.060
political series or not of one who embodied the American dream like new other,

115
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.810
I'm sure the result would look a lot like Kamala Harris, his profile, of course,

116
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.690
none of these things are her most important attributes, nor are the,

117
00:06:55.691 --> 00:06:57.970
any guarantee of anything, obviously,

118
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.180
but they are attributes that function as a kind of symbol and symbols are

119
00:07:01.181 --> 00:07:03.820
usually very significant in American society.

120
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.870
And they also explain to a large extent why Juul Biden has chosen her

121
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.980
specifically. Let's think about this for one second.

122
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.400
Biden is almost 78 years old and she is 55.

123
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.750
Biden is from the East coast and she is from the West Baden like Trump and Pence

124
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:20.500
are white men.

125
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.610
And she's a woman and is part of two minorities African-American and Indian

126
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.790
Biden as a reputation as a centrist and Harris as a moderate.

127
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:31.750
But that combination pushes a little more to the left. That is in other words,

128
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.330
she is the perfect compliment to Biden's candidacy.

129
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.560
And you know what Paul's say exactly the same thing.

130
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.890
Kamala Harris is more popular than biotin among women, young people,

131
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.710
and very importantly, amongst black voters.

132
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.520
And don't forget the low participation of the African-American voters in 2016

133
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.190
was one of the things that cost Hillary Clinton, the presidency,

134
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.810
but my friends haven't come this far.

135
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.660
I think the time has no come to ask ourselves the key question,

136
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.650
how the left wing is Kamala Harris or to put it more diplomatically.

137
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.420
What policies does she stand for?

138
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.990
And why is this something that could be so important to the United States?

139
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.153
Listen up.

140
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.080
<v 1>A little bit of everything.</v>

141
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.450
<v 0>My friends for most of the history of the United States,</v>

142
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.930
vice presidents have had virtually no influence the vice presidency.

143
00:08:19.931 --> 00:08:23.440
It was essentially a considered an empty position of responsibility and merely

144
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.130
honorary and most cases they didn't even participate in government meetings.

145
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.670
They were only there in case anything happened to the president.

146
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.680
<v 1>The vice-president is the most insignificant office ever conceived by the human</v>

147
00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:38.830
mind. John Adams, vice president of George Washington,

148
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.170
and second president of the United States.

149
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.940
The vice president of the United States is like a man in a catalytic state.

150
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.670
He can not speak, he could not move. He suffers no pain.

151
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.150
And yet he is perfectly conscious of everything that is going on about him.

152
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:56.070
Thomas Riley, Marshall vice-president of Woodrow. Okay.

153
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.740
<v 0>And I thought, I hated my job before coming to work here. Hello,</v>

154
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:01.800
let's take a minute because this is something that has been changing in the 21st

155
00:09:01.801 --> 00:09:05.460
century And recent administrations.

156
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:08.790
The role of the vice president has been quite significant actually, for example,

157
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.530
Dick Cheney with George W.

158
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.920
Bush and Joe Biden with Barack Obama had a lot of influence and were responsible

159
00:09:13.921 --> 00:09:17.130
for some of the most important policies during those administrations.

160
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.550
So should Biden become the 46th president of the United States?

161
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.530
The vice president could be one of the most important,

162
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.400
if not the most important in the country's history. Why? Well,

163
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.350
check out new stories like this.

164
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.240
<v 1>Off of Democrats, don't think Biden will serve all four years.</v>

165
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.560
A majority of voters,

166
00:09:33.561 --> 00:09:37.640
including half of Democrats do not think that 77 year old Democrats,

167
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:41.630
Joe Biden will serve all four years as president Washington exam.

168
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.930
<v 0>Let's assume however that he does complete his first term ever elected.</v>

169
00:09:44.931 --> 00:09:45.321
Of course,

170
00:09:45.321 --> 00:09:49.400
the truth is the Biden would be facing the next campaign almost 82 years old,

171
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.070
82 years on the planet. That's kind of a long.

172
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.520
And you think that makes it virtually a given the Juul Biden would not aspire to

173
00:09:55.521 --> 00:09:56.120
reelection.

174
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.570
And then the administration could therefore devote much of its efforts to

175
00:09:59.571 --> 00:10:03.140
boosting a candidate who would continue his work. The vice president.

176
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.360
That is why at these particular elections,

177
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.290
it's more important to know what Mrs. Kamala Harris is thinking and standing

178
00:10:09.291 --> 00:10:10.670
for. So my friends.

179
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.833
<v 6>Let's get into it.</v>

180
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.960
<v 1>Kamala Harris, more liberal than Bernie Sanders.</v>

181
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.510
Senate record analysis shows Newsweek.

182
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.340
Our ideology score plays to Kamala Harris is the most liberal Senator in

183
00:10:28.341 --> 00:10:32.450
2019 dove track and independent and non-partisan project.

184
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:36.260
<v 0>Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. Just wait one minute. The most left wing Senator.</v>

185
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:41.060
So are Republicans, right? When they accused Jairus of being a radical well, no,

186
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.860
the truth has no, no, exactly.

187
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:46.070
Or rather we have to be careful with these types of rankings because they are

188
00:10:46.071 --> 00:10:47.810
based on a very general premise,

189
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.080
not to mention when you're in campaign mode,

190
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.240
you sometimes support things that you wouldn't stick with.

191
00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:56.420
If a decision is really at stake and the truth is Senator Harris,

192
00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:01.070
ideologically is not very far to the left, at least not in every matter.

193
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:04.520
So let me explain one of the most important issues and where we are going to see

194
00:11:04.521 --> 00:11:07.790
the biggest differences between the center and the left wing of the democratic

195
00:11:07.791 --> 00:11:11.360
party occupied currently with the lakes of Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio,

196
00:11:11.361 --> 00:11:11.930
Cortez,

197
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:16.520
and Elizabeth Warren is in the issue of what else taxes you see

198
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.160
both Senator and former democratic primary candidate,

199
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.470
Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden's new partner,

200
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.950
what the tax system to be more progressive, but as always,

201
00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:27.860
they want to achieve this end very different ways. You know,

202
00:11:27.861 --> 00:11:29.600
the saying the devil is in.

203
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.753
<v 6>The detail.</v>

204
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:38.240
<v 0>And as you'll see the tax proposals from these two senators could not be more</v>

205
00:11:38.241 --> 00:11:42.230
different while Elizabeth Warren advocates carrying out massive tax increases

206
00:11:42.231 --> 00:11:43.760
and setting new taxes,

207
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:47.360
such as a wealth tax to finance badly underfunded utilities,

208
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.930
Kamala Harris proposed the so-called left. The middle-class act.

209
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.820
This law would increase the escalation of the tax through a sharp drop in taxes

210
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.180
on the middle classes and on lower income households. Senator Harris,

211
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:02.650
his proposal is to pass a refundable tax credit of up to $3,000 for single

212
00:12:02.651 --> 00:12:06.010
people and $6,000 for married couples. To get this credit,

213
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.820
you have to have a job and earn less than a hundred thousand dollars a year to

214
00:12:09.821 --> 00:12:10.630
give you an idea.

215
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:14.170
This would actually mean a tax cut of nearly 300 billion a year that would

216
00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:16.900
benefit about 18 million Americans.

217
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.140
The idea of this refundable credit is as follows. For example,

218
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:24.010
if your tax bill amongst the $5,000 in federal taxes and you're eligible for

219
00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:28.420
this $3,000 credit, you don't have to pay the difference $2,000. And if,

220
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.230
for example,

221
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.620
you only have to pay $1,000 in taxes because you have a very low salary.

222
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.710
<v 7>State gives you the difference.</v>

223
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.590
<v 0>It's a formula that already exists in the United States and has worked</v>

224
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.890
relatively well because you have to have a job to receive these benefits.

225
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.000
Let's just say it's a clear incentive to become part of the workforce. In fact,

226
00:12:48.001 --> 00:12:51.270
experience tells us the programs that are already underway have increased

227
00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:51.900
employment,

228
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.350
and therefore the collection of taxes related to work and excise duty

229
00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.080
This while reducing the demand for other social benefits.

230
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:04.860
The result is that the cost of these two programs already underway has been

231
00:13:04.861 --> 00:13:08.310
relatively low. So you may or may not link such plans,

232
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:12.660
but they are pretty far from radical left-wing policies. On the contrary,

233
00:13:12.661 --> 00:13:13.440
in fact, Harris,

234
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.160
his proposal is a bigger tax cut than promised by Donald Trump himself.

235
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.160
It's just going to the little guy instead of the big one.

236
00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.130
And while it is true that she wants to finance it by reversing parts,

237
00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.670
if only parts of the Trump reform and also setting a tax on financial

238
00:13:26.671 --> 00:13:27.420
transactions,

239
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.960
the final result of Biden's vice president's proposal would mean a significant

240
00:13:30.961 --> 00:13:32.880
tax cut, whichever way you look at it

241
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:41.550
As always another one of the most important and controversial fields in America

242
00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.710
is that of health Kamala Harris.

243
00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.980
Co-sponsored the Medicare for all act introduced by Bernie Sanders,

244
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:50.250
a bill that proposed to completely eliminate private insurance.

245
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.180
This was a topic that generated so much controversy that the Senator ended up

246
00:13:54.181 --> 00:13:55.410
presenting her own plan,

247
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.010
a plan that dead maintain the role of private insurers and the Medicare system,

248
00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.240
but which strengthened public insurance and above all advanced that increasingly

249
00:14:03.241 --> 00:14:07.440
widespread idea and the democratic party of transforming the American system and

250
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.280
to a single payer system that is a system with universal healthcare.

251
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:14.220
Like many of us have here in good old Europe where you eat,

252
00:14:14.221 --> 00:14:17.850
don't think that you should die. If you don't have enough money or radical.

253
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.390
The only thing that Kamala Harris doesn't detail is how to pay for all this

254
00:14:21.391 --> 00:14:24.030
transformation in front of her, however, is the Baden plan.

255
00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.830
And it's not exactly along the same lane,

256
00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.800
but the truth is that the Senator for California doesn't seem to have the

257
00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:29.760
slightest problem. There.

258
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.290
<v 7>She is a pragmatist</v>

259
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:35.903
and yes.

260
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:36.660
<v 0>Is true.</v>

261
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.050
Apparently she has some possessions that are perhaps a little more to the left

262
00:14:40.051 --> 00:14:43.050
and politics have normally been comfortable with in the United States.

263
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.570
And when it comes to the crunch, as also happened with Obama,

264
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.960
she has always been in claims to reconcile these ideas with the interest of

265
00:14:48.961 --> 00:14:52.910
different sectors, including the business world. And maybe that is why,

266
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.970
and this election, both Silicon Valley on wall street,

267
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:59.930
it was famously socialists institutions are behind the Baden and Harris'

268
00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.380
candidacy. Yeah, you heard that correctly. In fact,

269
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:07.670
wall street financers are donating a lot more money to Biden's candidacy than to

270
00:15:07.671 --> 00:15:10.970
Trump's. But beyond these two issues, perhaps Kamala Harris,

271
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:14.690
his most controversial policies include our support for the naturalization of

272
00:15:14.691 --> 00:15:15.500
illegal immigrants,

273
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.040
her defense being that it has to be easier to get the country to go to work and

274
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.880
her commitment to investing a lot of money and the environment and fighting

275
00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:24.020
climate change.

276
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.750
<v 5>First. And it's important to know.</v>

277
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:31.180
I do disagree with a lot of the things on your platform and others,

278
00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:33.010
and I am a Republican.

279
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.400
I know you're here because you love our country and I'm here for the same

280
00:15:36.401 --> 00:15:36.701
reason.

281
00:15:36.701 --> 00:15:40.210
And I know that about you because you're here right now and you had the courage

282
00:15:40.211 --> 00:15:43.240
to stand up and say what you said. And that means a lot.

283
00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.310
<v 0>Fair to Kamala Harris.</v>

284
00:15:48.311 --> 00:15:51.280
This has been a constant throughout retirement and the Senate promise more and

285
00:15:51.281 --> 00:15:53.200
more public spending commitments and total,

286
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.180
according to estimates by Brian Rodale,

287
00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:59.890
a budget expert at the Manhattan Institute, Harris has proposed 46 trillion,

288
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:00.640
yes,

289
00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:05.230
with a T 46 trillion and new public spending over the next decade.

290
00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:06.910
Evidently not even sheep.

291
00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.420
The Senator herself thinks it is possible to carry out everything she has voted

292
00:16:10.421 --> 00:16:11.530
for or promised.

293
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:14.530
And the main problem with this is not only that it can lead to disappointed

294
00:16:14.531 --> 00:16:15.490
expectations,

295
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:18.850
but above all her discourse creates is the perfect breeding ground for the

296
00:16:18.851 --> 00:16:22.960
so-called more radical rhetoric such as that of Bernie Sanders are Alexandria

297
00:16:22.961 --> 00:16:24.970
Ocasio Cortez to become the norm.

298
00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.030
She may be much more moderate than she is painted by the Republican party.

299
00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:28.721
But so far,

300
00:16:28.721 --> 00:16:31.990
she has not contributed to the slightest to strengthening that moderate base

301
00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:33.760
within the democratic party.

302
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:37.840
But my friends,

303
00:16:37.841 --> 00:16:41.230
if Kamala Harris were to become the 47th president of the United States,

304
00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.590
her main move for sure would be the reform of the United States,

305
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:46.630
judicial police and criminal system,

306
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.170
something which based on all available data relating to criminality,

307
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.180
police negligence and prison populations,

308
00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.480
topics that we have already spoken to you about here at length on visual politic

309
00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.100
is really very lacking

310
00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:01.773
Topic.

311
00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:05.320
Harris supports plans to reduce prison sentences and exchange for job training

312
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.940
or reintegration programs.

313
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.420
She wants to improve police training and limit police impunity,

314
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.370
or their ability to use force measure.

315
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.730
She also wants to legalize marijuana at the federal level abolish the death

316
00:17:15.731 --> 00:17:20.170
penalty and to end the cash bail bond system that forces people to serve years

317
00:17:20.171 --> 00:17:22.060
and remand before even facing trial,

318
00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:24.910
simply for not having the money to buy bail. In fact,

319
00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:28.270
she presented just such an initiative and the Senate alongside Republican

320
00:17:28.271 --> 00:17:29.350
Senator Rand, Paul,

321
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:34.600
And make no mistake.

322
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:37.900
This move shows us that we are not looking at the typical democratic candidate

323
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:39.700
who does not want to face up to crane.

324
00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:43.180
Many of these proposed initiatives really do make a lot of sense.

325
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:44.050
You can be firm,

326
00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:47.380
but you can also think about constructive ways of solving problems.

327
00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:50.340
Not everything has to be scaring people's straights. For example,

328
00:17:50.341 --> 00:17:53.940
when she was California's attorney general and an effort to reduce absenteeism

329
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:55.620
and improve academic outcomes,

330
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:59.550
she led an initiative to prosecute parents whose children were systematically

331
00:17:59.551 --> 00:18:02.580
missing from school. Something, which by the way,

332
00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:07.500
many Republicans liked a lot, but not so much the left wing Democrats. In fact,

333
00:18:07.501 --> 00:18:10.620
her heavy haunted rule in California is one of the things that the left wing

334
00:18:10.621 --> 00:18:15.000
factions most criticized. Anyway, there you have it, a profile of Kamala Harris,

335
00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.890
a candidate who does as is true.

336
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.890
It seemed to be a little farther to the left and the U S politics has ever been

337
00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:22.470
in the past. She's basically a European conservative,

338
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.350
but I'm sure we'll have the opportunity to talk about her on many more

339
00:18:25.351 --> 00:18:28.650
occasions. So now it's your turn. What did you think about Kamala Harris?

340
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.200
Do you think we'll get to see her sitting in the oval office one day.

341
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:34.350

345
