1
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.490
<v 0>I am sure.</v>

2
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.100
<v 1>The, for many of you who are watching us from non English speaking countries,</v>

3
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.580
the name Jacinda Arden is probably unknown to you yet.

4
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.300
And the Anglo-Saxon world, especially among progressive center left circles.

5
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.530
This woman is becoming an inspiration, practically, an idol of the masses.

6
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.260
We're talking about the current prime minister of New Zealand,

7
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.183
a blood tickle figure.

8
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.640
Who's been labeled by pretty much all the progressive media and the Anglo-Saxon

9
00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:36.440
world as the antithesis of Trump,

10
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.590
the kind of leader that anyone would want to have an his or her country,

11
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.380
something like a new symbol of global social democracy.

12
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.900
<v 2>Jacinda Arden is showing the world what real leadership is, sympathy,</v>

13
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.370
love, and integrity.

14
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.600
The guardian new Zealand's prime minister Jacinda [inaudible] is young

15
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.610
forward-looking and unabashedly liberal color, the anti-Trump Vogue.

16
00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.503
So.

17
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.940
<v 1>Exactly it's just sent to Arden. And why on earth?</v>

18
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.570
Has she garnered so much praise from certain sectors of the international press?

19
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.140
<v 0>Well.</v>

20
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.640
<v 1>Besides being the youngest New Zealand leader and the last 150 years,</v>

21
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.860
she came to power at age 37,

22
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.830
just in the Arden was also a committed Mormon until she left the very

23
00:01:18.831 --> 00:01:23.360
conservative church in 2005 to fight for LGBT rights. However,

24
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.630
despite her current agnosticism and criticism of her previous faith,

25
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.870
the truth is that the New Zealand leader of the Mormon church has only good

26
00:01:29.871 --> 00:01:31.490
words to say a bigger in any case.

27
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.430
The most remarkable thing about her beginnings was not to religion,

28
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.190
but that she spent time growing up, surrounded by social problems.

29
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.310
And we repower a small town with a lot of Murray gang activity.

30
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.500
And one that suffered from being socially isolated.

31
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.470
It was there that she decided to become a political figure.

32
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.100
Arvind joined the labor party very early when she was just 17,

33
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.080
before she even began her university studies,

34
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.290
her first contact with real politics was her involvement and labor politician,

35
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.330
Harry Donovan's reelection campaign.

36
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.210
And the fact is that after traveling to the United Kingdom,

37
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.510
working for two and a half years in Tony Blair's cabin office and becoming

38
00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:08.840
president of the international union of socialist youth ardent eventually took

39
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:12.950
over the leadership of the New Zealand labor party in 2017. Yeah.

40
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.870
In 2017,

41
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.200
exactly the same year that she was elected as the youngest prime minister,

42
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.550
as well as being the youngest member of that parliament. This is all a very,

43
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.630
very good example of what could accurately be described as a meteoric political

44
00:02:26.631 --> 00:02:29.870
career, or maybe just extremely good luck, either way.

45
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.440
It is likely at this point that you've got more questions than answers.

46
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.690
What led new Zealanders to trust Arden?

47
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.210
How did you become prime minister in 2017?

48
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.050
What has driven her reelection in 2020 has just into art and really being such a

49
00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:45.560
successful leader, or is everything not as pretty as it looks well,

50
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.510
we're just about to tell you, but before we get started,

51
00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:50.180
I just want to remind you of our new channel visual Academy,

52
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.090
where we look at all the best people, places and periods in history.

53
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.720
It's got great animations, interesting stories, and I've always over the,

54
00:02:56.721 --> 00:03:00.340
I think you may recognize you should check it out anyway, let's get cracking.

55
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.360
<v 0>The great and controversial coalition.</v>

56
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.930
<v 1>Despite her meteoric rise and the history of successes, champagne, wine,</v>

57
00:03:12.931 --> 00:03:14.850
and roses that she seems to have left in her. Wake.

58
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.940
The truth is that just in the Arden did not become prime minister as the

59
00:03:17.941 --> 00:03:18.450
favorite,

60
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.170
the real winner of the 2017 election race was the national party with its kind

61
00:03:22.171 --> 00:03:25.020
of date, bill English, the incumbent New Zealand prime minister,

62
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.720
who was running for reelection after spending less than a year.

63
00:03:27.721 --> 00:03:31.260
And the rule as John key's replacement key resigned precisely to make.

64
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.873
<v 0>And.</v>

65
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.110
<v 1>However, despite the fact that the national parks, one 56 of the 120 seats,</v>

66
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.260
and therefore was only five seats short of an absolute majority,

67
00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.660
both the Maori party and the United future party,

68
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.310
which had supported the previous government,

69
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.390
lost their seats to the Jacinta Arden's labor party managed to form an attentive

70
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.200
coalition.

71
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.010
And this was not your typical left-wing coalition with ideological allies.

72
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.420
Not at all. In fact,

73
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.000
Jacinda Arden agreed to our coalition with New Zealand first,

74
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.160
our right wing party with populist overtones.

75
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.220
There was a pack that was also made with what is called an exercise and

76
00:04:05.221 --> 00:04:08.520
confidence and supply from the green party that allowed Arden to gain a

77
00:04:08.521 --> 00:04:11.010
majority. And I used to the national park date from power.

78
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.830
<v 0>So.</v>

79
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.280
<v 1>To anyone's eyes, that's a real potpourri, a hotspot of political possessions.</v>

80
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.430
And example of what is usually known as a Frankenstein government.

81
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.970
The point is that this coalition was controversial because although the labor

82
00:04:23.971 --> 00:04:25.620
party was guaranteed to return to power,

83
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.100
it did suit with an obvious minority against the trend of what the majority of

84
00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:33.450
new Zealanders had voted for. And not exactly within natural allies by its site.

85
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.990
This is equivalent to something like a pact between Donald Trump and Bernie

86
00:04:36.991 --> 00:04:40.770
Sanders. I mean, can you imagine that, although now that I think about it,

87
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.850
it actually doesn't sound so strange. Either 2020 has been a weird year anyway,

88
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.710
to make the challenge even more complicated.

89
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.560
The economic and employment performance that New Zealand had had during the

90
00:04:49.561 --> 00:04:53.850
proceeding years under the leadership of the national party had been envy.

91
00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.380
<v 0>The.</v>

92
00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.910
<v 1>Conservative government of John Key,</v>

93
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.150
who governed the Island nation between 2008 and 2016,

94
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.420
the country successfully weathered the great economic crisis by suffering only a

95
00:05:06.421 --> 00:05:09.930
slight recession after which the economy quickly returned to a scenario of solid

96
00:05:09.931 --> 00:05:10.350
growth.

97
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.120
New Zealand clocked up several years with rates above 3.5% year on year growth.

98
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.720
Unemployment also remained a decent levels during that period with rates

99
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.330
averaging between five and 7%. However,

100
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.420
one of the biggest problems for the country during these years of prosperity was

101
00:05:24.421 --> 00:05:27.240
the high price of housing and it's continuous upward trend.

102
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.850
And that was precisely one of the great battlefields for us,

103
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.140
But in this favorable backdrop,

104
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.340
it is not surprising that the winner of the 2017 elections was not Arden but

105
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.170
English. And it was also not surprising.

106
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.950
Therefore the Arden would have to resort to such a coalition to take power.

107
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.060
What affected this medley of parties and ideologies have on the prime minister's

108
00:05:48.061 --> 00:05:51.420
policies between 2017 and 2020? Yeah.

109
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.370
And New Zealand elections are held every three years, not every four or five.

110
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.770
Well, basically the result of this Frankenstein type coalition was immobility

111
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.700
In broad terms I've just sent to Arden,

112
00:06:06.701 --> 00:06:09.670
had been characterized by anything during our first two years in office,

113
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.310
it has been by doing little and what little she has done.

114
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.510
She has done discreetly being associated with a party like New Zealand,

115
00:06:16.511 --> 00:06:19.690
first knit, many of Arden's progressive aspirations. And the bud has,

116
00:06:19.691 --> 00:06:23.650
she had to moderate her policies and turn more towards the center in practice.

117
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.860
This resulted in a government that was in separate to say the least not very

118
00:06:26.861 --> 00:06:30.220
active and incapable of delivering on a good part of the labor electoral

119
00:06:30.221 --> 00:06:33.130
promises, which were centered above all on the price of housing,

120
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.450
gender equality, and child poverty, poverty by New Zealand standards. Thighs,

121
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.040
hold on one moment just into Arden has just swept the 2020 elections that were

122
00:06:42.041 --> 00:06:42.910
held in October.

123
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.760
We are talking about nothing less than the first absolute majority since the

124
00:06:45.761 --> 00:06:47.890
country's 1996 political reform.

125
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.210
So the question is how on earth is it possible that Jacinda Arden has crushed it

126
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.910
and has had such a triumphant victory and this election,

127
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.270
especially when at the beginning of the year in January, 2020,

128
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.660
she was not even leading in the polls at that time, the opposition leader,

129
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.310
Judith Collins was ahead.

130
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.630
So what could possibly have happened to make that scenario turnaround so

131
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.170
radically? Well, my friends, the fact is that soon after these pools,

132
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.600
the Corona virus arrived check.

133
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.260
<v 0>The historic labor party.</v>

134
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.640
<v 1>Uh, friends of visual politic.</v>

135
00:07:24.641 --> 00:07:26.890
You may have your own opinion about Jacinda Arden,

136
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.280
but the reality is that this young 40 year old politician has managed to conquer

137
00:07:30.281 --> 00:07:33.760
the heart of New Zealand. Her labor party's result in the October,

138
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.440
2020 elections was overwhelming an absolute majority with 64 seats.

139
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.880
I have 120 18 more than in 2017 and 49.1,

140
00:07:42.881 --> 00:07:45.340
5% of the votes, her conservative rival,

141
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:51.010
Judith Collins only got 35 seats losing a whopping 21 in just three years and

142
00:07:51.011 --> 00:07:55.000
gaining less than 27% of the vote in total, based on those results,

143
00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.730
you could be mistaken for thinking the Arden's first term was an enormous

144
00:07:57.731 --> 00:08:00.700
political, economic and social success. However,

145
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.140
our party's victory is almost exclusively limited to a tremendous stupendous

146
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.070
fermentable and enviable performance and managing the SARS coronavirus to

147
00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:10.630
pandemic. Take a look.

148
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.110
The very first minute Jacinta Arden's government made the decision.

149
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.650
The pandemic response would be led by experts and scientists and not by

150
00:08:20.651 --> 00:08:24.430
political or economic criteria as was the case in Spain, the United States,

151
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:25.630
and many other countries.

152
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.090
The big difference that this decision made can be seen,

153
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.780
especially in the New Zealand figures and a country of almost 5 million

154
00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:32.500
inhabitants.

155
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.450
This Island nation has recorded fewer than 2000 cases and 25 deaths.

156
00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.770
Since the beginning of the past. In fact,

157
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.460
the country has gone weeks without a single case and is even declared the

158
00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:47.620
eradication of the Corona virus, transmission.

159
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:53.500
<v 0>Weiss, 8th of June, 2020, New Zealand declares itself,</v>

160
00:08:53.501 --> 00:08:56.100
Corona virus free after last case.

161
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.860
<v 2>Georgia five 7th of October, 20,</v>

162
00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:02.820
20 New Zealand stamps out the virus for a second time.

163
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:03.930
The New York times.

164
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.280
<v 1>Arden government's approach to the Corona virus has not only saved hundreds,</v>

165
00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:11.480
possibly thousands of lives, but also thousands and thousands of jobs.

166
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:15.320
And in general has put the country's economy in a relatively advantageous

167
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.550
possession. While in Europe,

168
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:20.660
there are countries whose recessions in 2020 are already close to 20% of their

169
00:09:20.661 --> 00:09:21.410
GDP.

170
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:25.910
New Zealand has a projected economic performance of only minus 2% year on year.

171
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.750
And that's my friends and the time we are living as quite an achievement,

172
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:33.170
but how on earth did they achieve such a result? Well,

173
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.000
basically the Kiwis locked themselves.

174
00:09:35.001 --> 00:09:37.760
Don't in their country before the vast majority of countries.

175
00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:38.923
<v 0>In the world.</v>

176
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.340
<v 1>The border locked down to prevent foreigners from entering the country,</v>

177
00:09:43.341 --> 00:09:45.440
began there on February 3rd, that's right,

178
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:49.730
February and any new Zealander coming first from China and later from any other

179
00:09:49.731 --> 00:09:53.510
place have to go through a mandatory 14 day quarantine upon arrival in the

180
00:09:53.511 --> 00:09:55.700
country. And addition by the end of March,

181
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.150
New Zealand had a four-phase warning system best stablish restrictions,

182
00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.330
closers and confinements based on transmission levels,

183
00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.420
not to mention the clear communication policy that the government has carried

184
00:10:05.421 --> 00:10:06.680
out towards the population,

185
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:10.210
treating them as adults and therefore making them aware of the risks,

186
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.090
the virus poses,

187
00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:15.290
and also the importance of complying with the rules to avoid outbreaks

188
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.830
All is that that wasn't enough to send the Arden has not waived either when it

189
00:10:21.831 --> 00:10:24.380
comes to standing her grunt as happened. For example,

190
00:10:24.381 --> 00:10:25.970
with a resignation of our health minister,

191
00:10:25.971 --> 00:10:29.780
after he skipped a quarantine imposed by resurgence in July of 2020,

192
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.160
a resignation that everything indicates was actually driven by art and herself.

193
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.950
<v 2>New Zealand, health minister, David Clark,</v>

194
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:41.420
quits over handling of COVID 19 outbreak during new Zealand's lockdown,

195
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:46.130
Clark was twice discovered breaching the strict stay-at-home rules once by going

196
00:10:46.131 --> 00:10:49.610
mountain biking. And a second time when he took his family for a beach trip,

197
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.640
23 kilometers from his Dunedin home, the guardian.

198
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.150
<v 1>All these early actions have made New Zealand the best Western country,</v>

199
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.390
at least in terms of political and social terms, managing the pandemic.

200
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.360
And one of the countries that's done the least damage to its economic fabric,

201
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.360
which puts it in a very advantageous position for the future.

202
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:09.020
And this has been precisely the political asset that triggered the popularity of

203
00:11:09.021 --> 00:11:12.650
the prime minister and led her to win the elections. So triumphantly.

204
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:16.100
And then there are those that say facing the coronavirus professionally does not

205
00:11:16.101 --> 00:11:17.600
win votes. Well,

206
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:25.010
The situation was such that the opposition leader of the national party,

207
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.190
Judith Collins believes that the only feasible flank of attack and the final

208
00:11:28.191 --> 00:11:31.490
stretch of her campaign had to be precisely that to discredit the liberal

209
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:33.650
party's management over the pandemic.

210
00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.350
<v 2>Judith Collins says Jacinda, Arden lied about COVID border testing, our N Z.</v>

211
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.090
She promised us all,

212
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.440
and we believed it foolish us for believing her that every border facing staff

213
00:11:45.441 --> 00:11:48.320
in those quarantine facilities was being tested regularly.

214
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:52.670
Then when it turned out that they weren't being tested regularly and COVID-19

215
00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:54.190
had come back into the country,

216
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.120
we were then told that only a third of them were being tested regularly.

217
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:03.040
Last week we found out in an official information act request came out actually

218
00:12:03.041 --> 00:12:07.600
only 7% of the border facing staff were being tested, not a hundred percent,

219
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:12.550
not a third, not two thirds seven, Judith Collins, national party candidate.

220
00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.330
<v 1>But of course, as right as Colin's may have been,</v>

221
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.840
which she surely was at the end of the day, what can I say?

222
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.090
Criticizing Arden for small mistakes,

223
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.360
given the way the pandemic has been managed in the rest of Western countries,

224
00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:28.800
because as if that wasn't going to work and obviously no,

225
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:29.790
it didn't work.

226
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:32.610
Perhaps the best battle lane for the final stretch of the campaign would have

227
00:12:32.611 --> 00:12:34.380
been another, because believe me,

228
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:37.410
Arden shortcomings throughout her administration have been numerous.

229
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.530
So do you want to know what your center has not done at the helm of the Kiwi

230
00:12:40.531 --> 00:12:43.860
country? How's our government had any notable successes beyond the pandemic?

231
00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.240
Well, let's take a look.

232
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:51.000
[inaudible].

233
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.860
<v 2>Great PR, but not much else.</v>

234
00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.500
<v 1>And there's one thing that is characterized Arden's campaign in 2020,</v>

235
00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.880
it's been as low profile.

236
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:03.120
Her rhetoric has been limited practically to selling her successes in the face

237
00:13:03.121 --> 00:13:05.790
of the pandemic and responding to all the attacks with evasions,

238
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.390
but without concrete policies, she called it a positive campaign.

239
00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:11.310
I imagine she means non-confrontational,

240
00:13:11.311 --> 00:13:13.830
but from non confrontation to political nothingness,

241
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.300
there was only one step and many analysts agree. The Arden has taken that stamp.

242
00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.220
<v 2>And this election campaign,</v>

243
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.550
everything that happened before the virus no longer mattered the first two

244
00:13:23.551 --> 00:13:24.690
years, no longer matter.

245
00:13:24.691 --> 00:13:29.010
And the only thing that people are voting on is the past eight months and which

246
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:32.940
party is going to be the strongest and the safest over the next three years.

247
00:13:32.941 --> 00:13:37.440
And that's the reason why just into our Dern and the labor party are so widely

248
00:13:37.441 --> 00:13:42.120
popular. They're the only answer for that Morgan Godfrey political commentator

249
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.610
specializing in indigenous mayors.

250
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.850
<v 1>If we look back to 2017, 2018,</v>

251
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.180
the truth is that the argument government has failed miserably on many issues.

252
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.460
We will give you a few examples here, check this out

253
00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:59.100
in 2016,

254
00:13:59.101 --> 00:14:02.640
one of Oregon's star promises was to reverse the rapid rise and housing prices

255
00:14:02.641 --> 00:14:06.060
in the country. And to that end, the main measure was to launch Kimi,

256
00:14:06.061 --> 00:14:10.710
built a program to build 100,000 public housing units in 10 years. Well,

257
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:15.300
all of those 100,000 homes, only 258 have been built by the end of 2019,

258
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.820
forcing the government to lower its own initial targets.

259
00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:20.610
And only that apart from not building these promised homes,

260
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.460
they have not been able to reverse the rapid rise in housing prices,

261
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.880
which already poses one of the biggest economic challenges for new Zealanders in

262
00:14:26.881 --> 00:14:28.350
particular young people.

263
00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.400
As you can see in this graph,

264
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:38.910
property prices have not stopped rising throughout the country except in

265
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.820
Auckland, but that's not necessarily good news. Either.

266
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.570
The average rent in Oakland has grown from 329 us dollars a week in

267
00:14:45.571 --> 00:14:49.590
September, 2017 to 349 in September in 2019,

268
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:53.900
an increase of about 6% in two years, almost three times the rate of inflation.

269
00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.580
And it's not just about Jose.

270
00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.170
The Arden government has also failed to improve the transport infrastructure

271
00:15:02.171 --> 00:15:04.930
deficit problem that New Zealand suffers from. For example,

272
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.420
they have not built the promised late rail to Auckland airport,

273
00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.660
and it almost completely halted roof construction focusing only on maintenance

274
00:15:10.661 --> 00:15:13.540
of existing routes, even though their promises went another way,

275
00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:14.890
what they have done, however,

276
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:17.680
is considerably expand the policy of social subsidies.

277
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.040
This is where they've really gone to town money for families,

278
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.610
with children to earn less than 50% of the national median income,

279
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.080
more money for college student support and the famous free first year of

280
00:15:29.081 --> 00:15:30.850
university for everyone,

281
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.760
even though the country already had an excellent system of university equity

282
00:15:33.761 --> 00:15:37.210
loans that were the envy of many countries and still begins a long list of

283
00:15:37.211 --> 00:15:38.200
assistance policies.

284
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.930
We'll have to wait and see what affects sharing the wealth have on what was

285
00:15:40.931 --> 00:15:44.650
perhaps one of the most prosperous countries in the world. Even with all this,

286
00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.030
perhaps the most shocking fact,

287
00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.000
the most surprising one and the one that should concern new Zealanders the most

288
00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.300
is that Jacinta Arden claims that the world leader she respects the most is none

289
00:15:52.301 --> 00:15:55.750
other than current Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sanchez. Yeah,

290
00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:57.850
really Pedro Sanchez. Okay.

291
00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.930
<v 3>Current world leader that you respect, uh, you, yes,</v>

292
00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:04.870
I can picture centuries from Spain.

293
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.180
<v 1>For the sake of the Kiwis.</v>

294
00:16:07.181 --> 00:16:10.380
I kind of hope she copies as much from him as she has copied of his disaster is

295
00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.840
management of the Corona virus in Spain, which is to say nothing,

296
00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:16.780
but let's not get sidetracked.

297
00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:20.320
What Arden has been reluctant to do is raise taxes and start regulating

298
00:16:20.321 --> 00:16:23.440
everything perhaps because our coalition partners and our first government would

299
00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:25.300
not allow it. So now the question is,

300
00:16:25.301 --> 00:16:27.850
what will she do with an absolute majority next.

301
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:33.160
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

302
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.980
<v 1>Kiwi analysts believes that just send a won't turn too far to the left.</v>

303
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:39.010
Now she doesn't need to rely on the agreement of another party to carry out our

304
00:16:39.011 --> 00:16:39.730
proposals.

305
00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:43.750
The reason because Arden is aware that a good part of her voters in 2020 have

306
00:16:43.751 --> 00:16:45.910
been people from the center and center, right?

307
00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.970
Including national party voters who have rewarded her for her management of the

308
00:16:48.971 --> 00:16:52.990
pandemic. But at the same time, they're looking for moderation.

309
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.740
If Arden starts pushing the button on proposals that are too socialist,

310
00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:58.810
it could cost her her job in three years.

311
00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.490
And if there was a consensus on anything,

312
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:04.300
it's the argument seeks to stay at least for a couple more terms as head of the

313
00:17:04.301 --> 00:17:07.620
country. In any case, just in the Ardennes reelection was a record,

314
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.770
the biggest labor victory,

315
00:17:08.771 --> 00:17:12.880
and at least 50 years after a previous term that every eliminated the management

316
00:17:12.881 --> 00:17:16.270
of the Corona virus would have gone mostly unnoticed.

317
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.300
The question of how long Arbonne will continue to lead to New Zealand is a

318
00:17:19.301 --> 00:17:19.840
mystery.

319
00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.740
But what seems clear is that an icon of Anglo-Saxon social democracy has been

320
00:17:23.741 --> 00:17:27.580
born an icon that could even become a benchmark for the global left.
