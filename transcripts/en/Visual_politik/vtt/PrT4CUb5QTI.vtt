<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.920
<v 1>Always teetering on the thin lane between legality and the dark side.</v>

3
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.090
Donald Trump is not a guy who likes to follow the rules to the letter. No,

4
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.430
I mean, it doesn't matter if we're talking about the elections,

5
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.300
the Ukraine transparency with respect to testing positive for the Corona virus

6
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.300
or about his own corporation. Over the years,

7
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.040
Donald Trump has built an image of a successful man around his own unique

8
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.670
personality. He has described himself time and again,

9
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.750
as a model entrepreneur capable of achieving everything he sets out to do,

10
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.670
even if he has to break some established rules along the way I kind of came,

11
00:00:49.671 --> 00:00:53.180
made us capable of turning everything. He touches into gold,

12
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.890
an unbeatable businessman, the best embodiment of American success.

13
00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.730
In fact,

14
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.080
this was precisely one of the arguments he used the most during his candidacy in

15
00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:05.300
2016 time. And again,

16
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.080
he promised that he would bring his successful and proven management skills to

17
00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:09.950
the oval office,

18
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.580
that he wouldn't manage the government with the same skill with what she had

19
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.580
always managed his empire. Now, though,

20
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.620
the question that comes up as what is the truth behind all of

21
00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:22.580
these stories?

22
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.630
Because my friends at the end of September, 2020,

23
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.330
the New York times published a detailed investigation,

24
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.950
the analyzes more than 20 years of fiscal information on both the president and

25
00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:38.180
his business network,

26
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.620
it has been the most in-depth research by far that has penetrated the debts of

27
00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:46.010
the business network of the 45th president of the United States of America.

28
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.610
A corporation made up of more than 500 entities.

29
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.290
The results of this research have brought to light a huge collection of lies,

30
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.980
deception, influence, peddling malpractice, but investments,

31
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.060
and more than clear suspicion about the recurrent use of tricks and cunning.

32
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.080
It's totally fake news. And, and this is the important thing.

33
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.790
Not always legally in order to reduce or evade the

34
00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:12.500
payment of taxes.

35
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.130
You see my friends according to information gathered by the New York times,

36
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.060
president Trump,

37
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.130
despite has immense fortune paid only $750 in taxes in

38
00:02:22.131 --> 00:02:25.640
2017, another $750 in 2016.

39
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.410
And for 10 of the previous 15 years, he paid absolutely nothing.

40
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.280
Just think about that.

41
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.570
All of us watching have paid more taxes recently and the president of the

42
00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:36.980
United States,

43
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.540
but that is not all the research also reveals how Trump's finances may be

44
00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:45.140
suffering as a result of the group's massive debt and poor results.

45
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.250
All of this is true.

46
00:02:46.251 --> 00:02:49.430
Despite the fact that many of their properties have become a kind of influence

47
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.560
bizarre that makes money from pressure groups,

48
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.880
lobbies companies are foreign governments that rent out Trump's properties in

49
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.430
order to win favor with the Trump family.

50
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.630
<v 0>Of course.</v>

51
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.450
<v 1>We're talking about the president of the United States.</v>

52
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.380
Naturally everyone wants to be close to the president.

53
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.250
Everyone wants to do him favors. And in Donald Trump's case,

54
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.930
that could be as simple as doing business with his companies. There is,

55
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.650
for example,

56
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.390
the case of the Mar-a-Lago club whose income has skyrocketed thanks to Trump's

57
00:03:24.391 --> 00:03:26.580
candidacy revenue from the club's membership fee,

58
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.610
increased 10 fold in 2016.

59
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.590
And that's before the Trump family doubled the fee and January, 2017,

60
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.540
this has allowed the president to reap an additional $26 million between

61
00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:41.730
2015 and 2018.

62
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.730
And of course, this is not the only example we can find.

63
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.610
<v 0>There are many, many more</v>

64
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.570
America, first America, first

65
00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.940
companies.

66
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.440
<v 1>Legal and administrative problems,</v>

67
00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:05.100
such as Walgreens pharmaceuticals or Atlin engineering company have rented out

68
00:04:05.101 --> 00:04:09.780
space and Trump's properties at a premium rate just when they were having

69
00:04:09.781 --> 00:04:14.580
problems with the administration, even foreign governments like Turkey,

70
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.460
holding and canceling events in a facility owned by Donald Trump,

71
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.570
depending on how things are going between the two countries. But wait,

72
00:04:21.571 --> 00:04:26.460
just one moment, because although these things may be, I don't know, suspicious,

73
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.800
contentious, possibly even controversial.

74
00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:31.470
The truth is that we could come to see them as almost,

75
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.000
almost something normal after all Donald Trump is a real estate

76
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.290
entrepreneur. However,

77
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.010
this is what a tiny drop in the ocean of controversy that the New York times

78
00:04:41.011 --> 00:04:44.100
investigation has uncovered. You see my friends and this video,

79
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.640
we're going to review the main issues that this investigation has revealed and

80
00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:50.400
how they fit with the image that almost all of us have,

81
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.470
or have had with president Trump.

82
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.520
Our intention is simply to bring you closer to the work done by the New York

83
00:04:56.521 --> 00:05:00.690
times. So, first of all, first of all, we need to know where did it all begin?

84
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.040
Where on height did Donald Trump make his immense fortune?

85
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.680
If you're interested, let's get cracking.

86
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.420
<v 0>The origin of empire.</v>

87
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.510
<v 1>Usually Donald Trump posts of being a self-made man,</v>

88
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.700
a shining example of the American dream,

89
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.190
a man turned into a money-making machine,

90
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.820
thanks to his superior business skills books.

91
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.110
Is this true? Or to put it another way? How much of this?

92
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.130
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

93
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.580
<v 1>You see Donald Trump as the son of Fred Trump, I New York city,</v>

94
00:05:41.581 --> 00:05:42.450
real estate developer,

95
00:05:42.451 --> 00:05:46.410
who made a huge fortune worth over $1 billion in today's money.

96
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.630
So at the age of three president,

97
00:05:48.631 --> 00:05:51.990
Trump was already earning $20,000 each year.

98
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.310
That's right at eight, he was already a millionaire at 17.

99
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.840
He was gifted ownership of an apartment building with 52 apartments.

100
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.700
By the time he graduated from college,

101
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.150
he was receiving $1 million a year from his father.

102
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.530
And that is a figure that only kept increasing Fred Trump meant his son,

103
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:13.280
Donald and employee manager, owner, banker,

104
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.180
and consultant within the family business with the likely goal of transferring

105
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:21.530
some of his wealth through salaries and therefore having to avoid paying a gift

106
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.140
tax. He also gave him one loan after another,

107
00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:28.010
without many of them ever being repaid and addition to transferring stock and

108
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:32.390
property to Donald below its value. Fred put money into Donald business.

109
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.150
He even paid his driver and total,

110
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:37.520
it is estimated that Donald Trump received at least

111
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.500
$413 million from his father. Oh, my dad gave me,

112
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.400
was this hairline? No,

113
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:51.170
it would be unfair to say that his entire fortune valued by Forbes at summit

114
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.360
$2 billion comes from him.

115
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:54.213
<v 0>His father.</v>

116
00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.360
<v 1>Only his father gave him Trump did what he had always done.</v>

117
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.470
He'd got himself into debt, up to his eyeballs,

118
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:10.210
hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars to build his empire.

119
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.690
His empire included real estate assets, such as the Trump tower,

120
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.650
the Plaza hotel,

121
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.800
and Mara Lago as well as speculative investments and the stock market,

122
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.780
a soccer team, Atlantic city casinos,

123
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.030
and even his own air transportation company.

124
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.510
The Trump shuttle incorporated by the end of the 1980s,

125
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:30.490
Trump seemed like a real King I came back to is who is up to his neck in

126
00:07:30.491 --> 00:07:34.570
debt. We're talking about more than $3.4 billion. Most of it,

127
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.690
and high end dressed junk bonds, a situation. In fact,

128
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.900
the soon after would lead their companies to be involved in a succession of

129
00:07:40.901 --> 00:07:43.870
bankruptcies that would end up costing investors, shareholders,

130
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.180
and partners who had trusted Trump,

131
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.900
some $1.5 billion. Strangely enough,

132
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.530
as we will see Trump came out relatively unscaved.

133
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:57.070
He collected generously from companies, even if they were not doing well,

134
00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:01.030
diverted funds to other projects and limited his liability through complex

135
00:08:01.031 --> 00:08:02.320
financial structures.

136
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:07.330
This is how he built what is now known as the Trump corporation. And this,

137
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.000
this brings us directly to another question.

138
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.570
How has Trump fared as an entrepreneur? Why is this performance been like,

139
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.700
did he really become a money-making machine.

140
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.570
<v 0>Shirts, couplings, everything sold at Macy's and they're doing great.</v>

141
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.280
Number one, selling tie anywhere in the world, ties are made in China, China,

142
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.750
showman, or entrepreneur.

143
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.700
<v 1>If there was one thing, the elevator Donald Trump to start them,</v>

144
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.410
it was the reality TV show. The apprentice go home, a television program,

145
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.490
which spoilers the contestants competed to develop the best project within a

146
00:08:42.491 --> 00:08:45.370
Trump company or property in the United States version,

147
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.810
a show in which the American tycoon also presented himself as an invincible

148
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.100
negotiator. The best of the best, the businessman who always got the deal.

149
00:08:54.101 --> 00:08:58.050
He said it again and made money. A lot of money.

150
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:02.970
Of course the reality was somewhat different and that is not just me

151
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:06.810
seeing it. Trump and self says it, listen to this.

152
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.050
<v 2>I play with people's fantasies.</v>

153
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.540
People want to believe that something is the greatest,

154
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:15.320
most valuable and most spectacular. I call it voracious hyperbole.

155
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.580
It is an innocent form of exaggeration and a very effective form of promotion.

156
00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.350
Donald Trump in the art of the deal.

157
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.570
<v 1>It was in the early years of the new century.</v>

158
00:09:23.571 --> 00:09:25.040
When the British television producer,

159
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:29.660
Mark Burnett proposed the idea of producing the reality show the apprentice at

160
00:09:29.661 --> 00:09:30.494
that time,

161
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:35.030
Trump was not at one of his high points after several bankruptcies and his core

162
00:09:35.031 --> 00:09:38.720
business, the empire kind of seemed to be falling apart.

163
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.410
<v 2>We walked around the offices and saw furniture splintered.</v>

164
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.900
We saw an empire crumbling at every turn.

165
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:47.150
Our job was to make it look like the opposite.

166
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.600
Bill Pruitt producer of the apprentice, speaking to the new Yorker.

167
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.800
<v 1>However, such a television program would change the course of events.</v>

168
00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:01.760
The apprentice was a huge success and one that triggered Donald Trump's

169
00:10:01.761 --> 00:10:05.060
popularity. According to the fiscal data verified by the New York times,

170
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:09.530
he errand $197 million during the time he was featured on the program,

171
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.770
but that's not all because his popularity was soaring.

172
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:16.070
Brands were fighting over each other to use him or his image.

173
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:18.860
And Trump refused virtually none of the offers.

174
00:10:18.861 --> 00:10:23.420
He got to plug a product or advertise something, hotels, pizzas, cookie sticks,

175
00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.820
vodka, board games, colognes, detergents, underwear.

176
00:10:25.821 --> 00:10:29.750
He even licensed his name for a lane of mattresses that bought him close to

177
00:10:29.751 --> 00:10:32.210
$15 million.

178
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:36.950
And total it is estimated that Trump earned at least $230 million from all those

179
00:10:36.951 --> 00:10:40.100
sponsorships that were directly linked to the enormous popularity.

180
00:10:40.101 --> 00:10:42.250
He had garnered from the television show,

181
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.980
a TV program that basically factored in Trump's portfolio by more than

182
00:10:45.981 --> 00:10:48.320
$420 million.

183
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:54.350
We are talking about probably the best business deal of his entire life.

184
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:55.483
<v 0>Your.</v>

185
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.150
<v 1>Of course it wasn't just mattresses ties and Kowloon.</v>

186
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.540
We were also other products that were more questionable. For example,

187
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:09.260
Trump promotes his companies based on Ponzi or pyramid schemes,

188
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.410
sold courses on how to become a millionaire to people with let's.

189
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.220
This is putting it lightly limited resources and even set up a kind of

190
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:21.200
university that in the end had to close down in the face of numerous allegations

191
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:25.490
of fraud and a lawsuit from the New York attorney General's office itself.

192
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.060
That case ended up with a settlement for which Trump was forced to pay

193
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.860
$25 million in compensation. A similar thing happened later,

194
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.110
by the way, with a Donald Trump foundation itself,

195
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.710
which had to be dissolved following a lawsuit for misuse by the New York

196
00:11:39.711 --> 00:11:43.880
attorney general Barbara Underwood. So this whole image about being squeaky.

197
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:48.590
<v 0>Clean, it turns out that was more than a little bit dirty.</v>

198
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.040
And addition Trump.

199
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.390
<v 1>Has also has no qualms about associating with people of how's best to put this</v>

200
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.930
dubious reputations. For example, in New York,

201
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:04.030
he was closely associated with Tiffin.

202
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.710
Areef a former Soviet era official and Kazakhstan whose right-hand man was Felix

203
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:13.390
setter or Russian immigrate with ties to the mafia and his very own criminal

204
00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:13.900
record,

205
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.860
no matter what Trump would gladly lend his name to the buildings of these

206
00:12:17.861 --> 00:12:21.700
developers, whose sources of funding were somewhat unclear.

207
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:25.270
I'm sure you can probably get an idea of what exactly was going on.

208
00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.460
And the well-known scandal was that of the budget, California, where Trump, I,

209
00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:36.150
his name and image to be used to market and brand a luxury apartment complex.

210
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:40.980
It was a project that resulted in $32 million just going missing and lots of

211
00:12:40.981 --> 00:12:45.570
fraud allegations against the developers and against the Trump family itself.

212
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:50.940
<v 3>Trump is being sued in Mexico for tax fraud in failed real estate project.</v>

213
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:51.803
Pan-Am.

214
00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:55.140
<v 1>Anyway, the point is that with all the money he got from TV,</v>

215
00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.060
Trump not only put his accounts in order,

216
00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.640
but then just as he had done with his father's money,

217
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:04.620
he repeated the process of destroying everything he had just recouped.

218
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:08.880
He reissued a lot of debt to take over beg real estate assets, hotels,

219
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:13.470
and this time golf courses and 11 new golf courses to be exact became part of

220
00:13:13.471 --> 00:13:14.304
the family.

221
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:19.030
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

222
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:23.250
<v 1>That's during the nineties Trump's companies did not make profits. For example,</v>

223
00:13:23.251 --> 00:13:24.390
since the year 2000,

224
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:28.440
their golf courses have registered more than $300 million in losses.

225
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:31.920
Another example, their hotel in Washington opened in 2016,

226
00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:36.720
reaped $55 million of losses in just two years. In fact,

227
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:40.530
among these few profitable assets are the Trump tower and Mar-a-Lago the balance

228
00:13:40.531 --> 00:13:44.100
sheets of the other businesses leave a lot to be desired.

229
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.130
You see my friends, Trump is a great communicator.

230
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.410
He knows how to reach his audience like nobody else,

231
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.340
and has had the ability to take advantage of it to make money off of his image.

232
00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:00.510
But as an entrepreneur and manager, that's another story. In fact,

233
00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:03.540
although Trump's activities go far beyond family money,

234
00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:06.960
there is a debate as to whether or not Trump would have been better off

235
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.710
investing all the money. His father gave him and the us stock market,

236
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.980
the profitability of the S and P 500 over the same period.

237
00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.250
It seems to have been higher than that of Trump's businesses.

238
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:20.940
But I think the best way to get to know the entrepreneurial side of Donald Trump

239
00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:25.290
is to take a look as Tang and it all antic city, and you're ready. Let's go.

240
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.970
<v 3>The Atlantic city disaster.</v>

241
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:36.420
<v 1>Friends.</v>

242
00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:40.950
There was a time when Donald Trump controlled the Atlantic city gaming industry,

243
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.640
Donald Trump controlled three of the largest complexes in the city,

244
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.640
including the Taj Mahal, which was opened in April,

245
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.370
1990 as the largest casino in the world.

246
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.360
Trump finance these operations with a lot of debt,

247
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:58.310
mostly junk bonds with rates of up to 14% per year of the wait for it,

248
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.880
3.4 billion with a B dollars in debt.

249
00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.930
The Trump organization was carrying 1.3 billion corresponding to the three

250
00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:09.050
casinos in Atlantic city. This meant not in 1991,

251
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.830
barely a year after it was launched. It had to declare bankruptcy.

252
00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:16.370
A few months later, it was joined by the other two casinos controlled by Trump,

253
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.920
the Trump Plaza and the Trump castle.

254
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.350
It was the first major bankruptcy of the group.

255
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.370
Trump was forced to give up 50% of his shares to creditors and exchange for

256
00:15:25.371 --> 00:15:28.310
their agreeing to reduce rates onto fair payments.

257
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:34.900
And this way the casinos could continue operating,

258
00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:39.340
but the problems did not disappear in 1995 faced with an eminent new

259
00:15:39.341 --> 00:15:39.970
bankruptcy,

260
00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:44.530
the New York tycoon and later president of the United States of America created

261
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.330
Trump hotels and casino resorts,

262
00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:49.930
a company that controlled the Trump Plaza and went public through a capital

263
00:15:49.931 --> 00:15:50.500
increase.

264
00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:54.880
The company raised $140 million and took advantage of this to issue another

265
00:15:54.881 --> 00:15:59.680
155 million and junk bonds at a 15.5% interest rates.

266
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:03.760
From that point on what took place was a management method that many experts

267
00:16:03.761 --> 00:16:07.810
would not hesitate to describe as dishonest and deceptive for the shareholders.

268
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.100
Trump used the $300 million raised by the new company to pay off loans.

269
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.600
He had personally guaranteed.

270
00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:17.583
<v 4>And that.</v>

271
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.780
<v 1>Not all one year later,</v>

272
00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:23.500
this company against a backdrop of grand announcements that overtime proves to

273
00:16:23.501 --> 00:16:25.510
be misleading at best.

274
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.810
They carried out a new capital increase and also issued another

275
00:16:28.811 --> 00:16:32.950
$1.1 billion and junk bonds with that money.

276
00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.590
The company continued to pay off Trump, guaranteed loons,

277
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.930
even though those loans have better terms than,

278
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.270
than junk bonds with which they were financing the repayment.

279
00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:44.860
He was also given a bonus of $5 million for his get less

280
00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.240
productivity.

281
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.870
And the company also acquired the other two casinos controlled personally by

282
00:16:49.871 --> 00:16:54.460
Trump at a price that many care holders considered insane.

283
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.900
The operation ended up in court. Trump also made loans to himself.

284
00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.210
And even though the company was going from bad to worse,

285
00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:04.300
he continued to receive a generous payout as chairman of the board.

286
00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.710
In addition to a payment of about $2 million each year for using the Trump name

287
00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:13.300
and the casinos. He even had the company rent offices in Trump tower.

288
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:15.600
And you might think to yourself, well, that's not so bad.

289
00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:17.740
Surely he can give himself a discount, but no,

290
00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:19.570
they weren't at a bargain price at.

291
00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:20.493
<v 4>All.</v>

292
00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:24.070
<v 1>And this way, by the year 2000,</v>

293
00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.310
the company had lost 80% of its stock market value,

294
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:28.960
but that was not going to be the worst thing.

295
00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:33.460
The Trump will tell us and casino resort to file for bankruptcy. First in 2004.

296
00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.800
And then again, in 2009,

297
00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:39.640
the company never made any money and gradually lost market share.

298
00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:40.870
And it's poorly maintained.

299
00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:44.800
Two hotels could not cope with the competition and total shareholders and

300
00:17:44.801 --> 00:17:49.290
creditors who had trusted Trump lost more than $1.5 billion due to

301
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.130
mismanagement by a company whose actions were taken more with Trump in mind than

302
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:55.860
the interest of the company, shareholders or employees.

303
00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.110
Despite the fact that the president made a lot of money.

304
00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.270
He wasn't spared from this disaster either,

305
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:08.480
but right around the same time and 2004,

306
00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:12.530
the apprentice was launched where Trump presented himself as a successful

307
00:18:12.531 --> 00:18:16.460
entrepreneur who knew how to do business better than anyone else.

308
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:20.330
You see my friends, this is a story we know about the Trump empire.

309
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:24.320
One thing, however, must be acknowledged.

310
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:27.890
Trump has managed communication like no other.

311
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.300
He used his father's money to create a public image that not only allowed them

312
00:18:35.301 --> 00:18:37.010
to do business and make money,

313
00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.870
but also to become one of the most admired people in America and end up in the

314
00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:46.640
history books as the president of the United States, of course, along the way,

315
00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:50.300
as you've seen, he left many burnt corporate bodies and many deaths,

316
00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.450
and there's WIC Trump as a top notch Schumann,

317
00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.920
but a good entrepreneur that is being a bit too generous.

318
00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:02.120
Let's just say that best. It's not clear. Wait,

319
00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.490
there's been a lot of talk about taxes lately.

320
00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.390
Does Trump pay taxes or does he not check this out?

321
00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:13.160
<v 5>Paid millions of dollars in tax is millions of dollars of income tax.</v>

322
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.130
Why doesn't Trump pay taxes?

323
00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.260
<v 1>You've seen so far Trump lives on the edge,</v>

324
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:25.820
if not far beyond the lane for 10 of the last 17 years,

325
00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:29.450
Donald Trump has not paid any federal income tax.

326
00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:34.400
And in 2016 and 2017, he paid only $750.

327
00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:38.420
And the question is, I want, are, can that be well,

328
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.720
there are two reasons. Firstly, many of his businesses,

329
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:45.410
as we have seen did not generate profits, but losses.

330
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:49.310
And if you're a business, if you don't make money, you don't have to pay.

331
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.150
And secondly,

332
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:53.630
because if Trump is exceptional in any way as precisely because he surrounds

333
00:19:53.631 --> 00:19:55.460
himself with good tax advisors,

334
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:58.730
even if that means not always complying with the law or at least occupying a

335
00:19:58.731 --> 00:20:02.630
decidedly, great area, questionable deductions, fictitious valuations,

336
00:20:02.631 --> 00:20:06.290
and proper refunds payments for consulting that are not well-defined to discuss

337
00:20:06.291 --> 00:20:07.880
taxes and the Trump corporation,

338
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.790
you need to be prepared to talk about all kinds of tax.

339
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:12.283
<v 0>Gibberish.</v>

340
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.910
<v 1>Example. In 2010,</v>

341
00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:21.380
Trump applied to the tax authorities for a $17 million rebates on a report to

342
00:20:21.381 --> 00:20:24.230
the losses from his Atlantic city operations. However,

343
00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:27.560
there are no serious doubts as to whether that request for reimbursement that

344
00:20:27.561 --> 00:20:29.180
was paid out by the way,

345
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:33.380
was well-funded that operation has been audited by the tax office and is now in

346
00:20:33.381 --> 00:20:35.390
the hands of a congressional committee.

347
00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:37.760
Trump may have to pay back all that money.

348
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:40.670
Plus a lot of interest for improperly requesting.

349
00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:41.723
<v 0>Refund.</v>

350
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.340
Another sensitive issue is that of his tax.

351
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.100
<v 1>Returns. Trump includes a lot of things as deductibles.</v>

352
00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.340
They seem to be more for personal than for corporate use. For example,

353
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.240
airplanes, country clubs, his mansions even has hairdresser. That's right.

354
00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:59.770
He pays money for that here.

355
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:03.550
Virtually everything he is built for is apparently tax deductible.

356
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.190
There is for example, the case of seven Springs,

357
00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.620
a huge property of 80 hectares with imaginate,

358
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:12.910
almost 5,000 square meters and three swimming pools. Well affectionately,

359
00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.950
the trumps consider it an investment asset.

360
00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.500
So the corporation deducts any expenses incurred by it,

361
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:21.580
even if it means changing a light bulb, an addition to the mortgage repayments.

362
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.200
However, when it comes down to it,

363
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:26.080
it appears to be nothing more than another one of the families,

364
00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:30.370
many residencies. And remember, we're not talking about small change here.

365
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.340
That's more than $2 million saved.

366
00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:36.630
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

367
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:39.930
<v 1>Another example is with lawyers. Trump has deducted lawyer's fees,</v>

368
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.390
even when they have defended him for personal matters,

369
00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.870
which it should be a surprise to no one is not allowed. Anyway,

370
00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.050
these are just a handful of examples out of hundreds and hundreds,

371
00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:53.070
which explain why Trump has barely paid any taxes over the last few decades,

372
00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:56.730
all this as the ends and outs of the Trump empire, my friends,

373
00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:01.440
a corporation lent by the 45th president of the United States whose secrets or

374
00:22:01.441 --> 00:22:04.140
rather skeletons have no come out of the closet.

375
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.990
Thanks to the extraordinary work of the New York times.

376
00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:10.890
Our intention with this video has simply been to shed light on the main findings

377
00:22:10.891 --> 00:22:13.860
of this investigation. But at this point, how about leaving us?

378
00:22:13.861 --> 00:22:16.800
Your thoughts about this whole saga and the comments is Trump.

379
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:20.010
A good businessman is all this tax shenanigans, just fair play.

380
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:23.160
And really why does he pay for that haircut?

381
00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:26.370
