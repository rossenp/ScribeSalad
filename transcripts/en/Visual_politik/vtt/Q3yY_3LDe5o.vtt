<v 1>Difference.</v>

3
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.430
I don't need to tell you that the coronavirus pandemic has inflicted terrible

4
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.670
damage to many countries all over the world in 2020.

5
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.760
I'm not going to tell you that the virus has spread through Asia, Europe,

6
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.790
Africa, and the Americas, nor that a lot of governments,

7
00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:29.150
including those of developed countries, such as Spain, United States,

8
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.720
or the United Kingdom have provided sad and bungling responses.

9
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.020
I won't try to explain what SARS coronavirus two is either.

10
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.380
I'm not going to do any of these things because you already know all of this.

11
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.350
In this video, we're going to focus on Argentina,

12
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.800
a country that is not only suffering the scourge of the coronavirus,

13
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.970
but is also caught in a perfect storm. A pandemic, an economic crisis,

14
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.790
a loan default, and a political confrontation.

15
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.163
<v 2>The car</v>

<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

23
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.840
<v 1>This is serious. Even for Argentina, the country that has made crises,</v>

24
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.130
a Mark of identity it's most defining feature, almost a tourist attraction.

25
00:01:40.131 --> 00:01:43.670
Do you want to see a crisis firsthand? The true effects of devaluation,

26
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.510
maybe even hyperinflation don't delay visit Argentina today,

27
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.870
we're currently offering eight two for the price of one deal. Well friends,

28
00:01:50.871 --> 00:01:52.520
unfortunately, even for a country,

29
00:01:52.521 --> 00:01:55.310
so experienced in dealing with financial crises,

30
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.070
this particular perfect storm may already be too much,

31
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.820
but let's start all the way at the beginning. Let's go back to March 20, 20.

32
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.043
<v 3>[Inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

[inaudible] [inaudible].

35
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.450
<v 1>It's time news about the spread of the virus through Asia and Europe led to the</v>

36
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:43.220
government of Alberto Fernandez to decree a strict quarantine on March 20th.

37
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.210
The official term used was preventative and obligatory social isolation.

38
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.620
The quarantine established an almost total closure of the country for two weeks

39
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.730
upon its enforcement.

40
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.660
All activities were suspended except for essential activities related to medical

41
00:02:56.661 --> 00:02:58.880
services and the distribution and sale of food.

42
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.680
All of the businesses had to be closed and the Argentinians had to stay at home.

43
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.850
The airports were also closed as well as all land and sea borders to contain the

44
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:09.070
arrival of the Corona virus, Argentina,

45
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.740
like many other countries went into hibernation mode.

46
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:16.410
<v 0>Friends.</v>

47
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.410
<v 1>From that moment on things changed almost completely.</v>

48
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.740
The use of masks became the norm trains and buses traveled almost without

49
00:03:22.741 --> 00:03:26.640
passengers and the city streets looked like those of an uninhabited town in the

50
00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:27.480
wild West.

51
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.500
And the surprising thing is that this prompt and energetic response made the

52
00:03:31.501 --> 00:03:33.000
popularity of the president.

53
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.380
Alberto Fernandez saw in a country historically divided at political level.

54
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.600
His approval ratings were close to 85%.

55
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.113
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

56
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.320
<v 1>Because this is far from the end of the story.</v>

57
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.500
Little by little,

58
00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:59.820
the enthusiasm and the new normal lost steam as the quarantine was extended

59
00:03:59.821 --> 00:04:04.680
again and again and again, every 15 days. And since then, yes,

60
00:04:04.681 --> 00:04:06.270
some things have changed.

61
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.630
The strict quarantine has been exchanged for strict social distancing and

62
00:04:09.631 --> 00:04:13.140
containment measures the terms the obligations have been modified.

63
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.280
But the truth is that almost six months on from that March 20th decree,

64
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.380
Argentina is still far from normal,

65
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.350
And it's not all due to the pandemic because as you will know,

66
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.390
we are not talking about just any country,

67
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.630
such long and civic warranty and containment measures would have a terrible

68
00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:34.470
effect on the economy of any country in the world. But in Argentina's case,

69
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.560
it's even worse. Why? Because even before the pandemic,

70
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.050
the Argentine economy was in a critical state.

71
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.040
So you can imagine how bad I'm talking, really bad things look right now.

72
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.030
So why is it that the quarantines and the extreme confinement of the country

73
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.560
have been extended for so long?

74
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.500
Why do the results seem so dire despite all the effort?

75
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.070
What has been the true impact of this pandemic on the Argentine economy and

76
00:04:56.071 --> 00:04:57.570
political landscape? There's an up.

77
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.793
<v 0>[Inaudible]</v>

78
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.190
an incomplete strategy.

79
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.390
<v 1>On 20th of March,</v>

80
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.380
the government of Alberto Fernandez declared a strict quarantine seeking the

81
00:05:25.381 --> 00:05:28.740
cooperation of the citizens themselves to enforce it. For example,

82
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.980
an official telephone number was created one, three, four, two,

83
00:05:31.981 --> 00:05:36.420
which any Argentine could call and report anyone who is not complying with the

84
00:05:36.421 --> 00:05:39.600
mandatory confinement and the measures decreed to deal with the pen.

85
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.193
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

86
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.910
<v 1>Oh, so a strong media campaign was to make people aware of the dangers that this</v>

87
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:02.420
virus could bring. This virus was presented as a silent killer,

88
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.080
a mass murderer raging out of control, the invisible enemy.

89
00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.290
<v 3>[Inaudible] in [inaudible] and in</v>

90
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.640
[inaudible] [inaudible] the enemy.

91
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.530
<v 1>Was to raise awareness among all Argentinians so that they would take the fight</v>

92
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.550
against the coronavirus,

93
00:06:27.551 --> 00:06:31.150
as seriously as if the virus were an invading country in this way,

94
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.840
citizens would comply with the harsh measures of confinement and social

95
00:06:34.841 --> 00:06:35.674
distancing

96
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.170
measures such as having to stay at home at all times,

97
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.360
except to perform essential activities.

98
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.030
This nipped mobility between provinces in the bud,

99
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.690
and even after the worst part of the quarantine was over citizens still needed

100
00:06:49.691 --> 00:06:53.380
to carry special permits and authorizations to be able to circulate in many

101
00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:57.430
places in the country, such as the metropolitan area of winners areas itself,

102
00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.920
as far as aviation and international travel goes,

103
00:06:59.921 --> 00:07:01.990
let's not even talk about it because friends,

104
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.560
Argentina is one of the few countries where no air connections have been

105
00:07:05.561 --> 00:07:09.550
resumed. In fact, if we take a look for example, at the flight radar app,

106
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.740
we are going to find a very unusual situation.

107
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.550
Little by little planes are beginning to take to the skies except in Argentina,

108
00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.590
where they've practically just disappeared.

109
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.810
If we talk about measures, they established some pretty controversial ones.

110
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.500
For example,

111
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.280
releasing lots of prisoners and quarantining them in their homes to prevent them

112
00:07:30.281 --> 00:07:32.740
from becoming sources of contagion within the prisons,

113
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.880
a measure that was put in place,

114
00:07:33.881 --> 00:07:37.600
following the recommendations of the human and the inter American commission on

115
00:07:37.601 --> 00:07:40.330
human rights. But which has been very controversial,

116
00:07:40.331 --> 00:07:43.870
particularly because there have been many known cases of prisoners sentenced for

117
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:44.800
serious crimes,

118
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.220
such as murder or rape who have managed to get released from the prison on this

119
00:07:48.221 --> 00:07:50.620
scheme and whether or not it's a contributing factor,

120
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.890
because the most important variable is probably the increase in poverty.

121
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.130
The truth is that in recent months there has been an impairment increase.

122
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.830
<v 4>In crime. The rise of insecurity,</v>

123
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.570
the new phase of the eternal quarantine by nasion Corona virus,

124
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.320
killers and abusers were released from prison because of the pandemic.

125
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:09.130
[inaudible].

126
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.900
<v 1>The point is that as you can see,</v>

127
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.860
our Berto Fernandez government has been very assertive in the fight against this

128
00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:18.100
pandemic rights from the beginning. Wouldn't you agree? Well, wait a minute,

129
00:08:18.101 --> 00:08:20.380
because there is something wrong. Take a look at it.

130
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.730
<v 4>This, the number of grown of virus deaths has doubled in the last three weeks.</v>

131
00:08:24.731 --> 00:08:29.590
And Argentina will reach 10,000 deaths after 170 days of quarantine in

132
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.130
full Bay.

133
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.340
<v 1>In spite of almost six months of quarantine and strict measures of social</v>

134
00:08:33.341 --> 00:08:35.830
confinement and distancing, as you can see in this graph,

135
00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:39.160
the curve of new cases has not let up. And so the question,

136
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:42.400
the logical question that we have to ask ourselves is what the hell is going

137
00:08:42.401 --> 00:08:43.234
wrong in Argentina?

138
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.630
Well, friends pay attention to news like this.

139
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:54.790
<v 4>Corona virus. Argentina could only test more than Bolivia, Ecuador,</v>

140
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.330
Guyana, and Suriname in the region. Claudia.

141
00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.040
<v 1>Bolivia, Guyana, and Suriname is this some kind of joke.</v>

142
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.700
Isn't Argentina supposed to be a much richer and more developed country. Well,

143
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:05.743
to give you an idea,

144
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:09.830
there is not a single country in Europe that does not exceed the number of tests

145
00:09:09.831 --> 00:09:12.950
per million carried out in Argentina, not a single one,

146
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.710
not even those that have been hardly hit by the pandemic.

147
00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:20.000
Let's just say that Argentina values are closer to Africa than to the old

148
00:09:20.001 --> 00:09:21.260
continent and take note,

149
00:09:21.261 --> 00:09:24.470
because one of the strategies shared by the countries that have the best results

150
00:09:24.471 --> 00:09:28.640
against the coronavirus has been to apply the strategy test, test, test.

151
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:32.300
This is the way you can identify infected people and isolate them to prevent

152
00:09:32.301 --> 00:09:33.240
them from infecting.

153
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.350
<v 3>[Inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] E</v>

154
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:52.003
[inaudible].

155
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.970
<v 1>Testing and tracking are two elements that are proving indispensable in</v>

156
00:09:55.971 --> 00:09:56.804
overcoming the score.

157
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:01.910
<v 3>However.</v>

158
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.130
<v 1>Argentina has opted for a different strategy.</v>

159
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.240
The government of Alberto Fernandez has bet practically everything on quarantine

160
00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:12.290
measures the problem. Well, as time goes by the measures of restriction,

161
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.530
quarantine and social distancing are losing their effect.

162
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:19.040
Let's say as time goes by either out of economic necessity,

163
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.690
exhaustion or low morale,

164
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.050
people will eventually leave their homes and returned to their normal lives.

165
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.290
In fact, this is exactly what happened in Argentina very quickly.

166
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.690
After the first week of strict confinement,

167
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.600
full compliance with the rules became less and less.

168
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:35.630
<v 3>The norm don't you.</v>

169
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:39.260
<v 1>Take our word for it. It's what president Fernandez himself says.</v>

170
00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.010
<v 4>August 13th, 2020, that they keep talking to me about.</v>

171
00:10:43.011 --> 00:10:46.100
Quarantine is something that amazes me because people are going out.

172
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.970
The number of cases is increasing because circulation is increasing because the

173
00:10:49.971 --> 00:10:54.440
care that we permanently ask for does not exist. Alberto Fernandez,

174
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.760
president of the urgent team.

175
00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.750
<v 1>With few tests and little ability to track and follow up on positive cases,</v>

176
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.350
it is very complicated. If not impossible to deal with this pandemic,

177
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:05.420
that at least is what the data says.

178
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.860
<v 3>[Inaudible] I didn't get any [inaudible].</v>

179
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.711
<v 1>True.</v>

180
00:11:24.711 --> 00:11:28.250
That for the time being Argentina has managed to have thanks to those measures,

181
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.470
uh, lower fatality rates than other countries.

182
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.100
This is partly because the evolution of the pandemic here has been slower.

183
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.340
And with the Corona virus, when the spread is very fast,

184
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.080
it is the overloading of hospitals.

185
00:11:39.081 --> 00:11:42.290
That is one of the causes of the multiplication of death rates.

186
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.230
But if cases continue continued rise like this in Argentina,

187
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.210
we may see more problems. On the other hand,

188
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:51.020
we cannot forget the economic effect of such an extended period of quarantine,

189
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.180
social confinement and distancing measures.

190
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.850
Friends' Argentina's economy has been in a more profound hibernation than any

191
00:11:57.851 --> 00:12:00.910
other country. And of course we are talking about Argentina,

192
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:05.140
a country whose foundations were not exactly solid before the pandemic.

193
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.990
And you probably know this very well because we have talked about it often on

194
00:12:07.991 --> 00:12:08.770
visual politic,

195
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.890
the country itself was going through almost two years of recession and was

196
00:12:11.891 --> 00:12:16.030
facing unpayable debt and runaway inflation long before Fernandez decreed the

197
00:12:16.031 --> 00:12:18.580
quarantine. And since then, things have only gotten worse.

198
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:27.510
Argentina is experiencing a greater economic downturn than the crisis of 2001 to

199
00:12:27.511 --> 00:12:31.800
2002, the worst economic disaster and its history. So far,

200
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:34.800
according to the Argentinian chamber of commerce and services,

201
00:12:34.801 --> 00:12:39.570
more than 42,000 small and medium sized companies have closed or are a bout to

202
00:12:39.571 --> 00:12:42.750
close in may the country announced its pimp default.

203
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:46.020
Then according to the ministry of labor, almost 2 million face,

204
00:12:46.021 --> 00:12:49.650
a very complicated employment scenario in which their jobs are suspended.

205
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.950
This is approximately one out of eight private sector jobs.

206
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.010
And given that the government has to resort to the central bank for financing,

207
00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.920
it is not hard to imagine that when things begin to normalize,

208
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:02.040
the country may even face a scenario of hyperinflation.

209
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:06.060
All of this explains why air clack the United nations economic commission for

210
00:13:06.061 --> 00:13:10.710
Latin America and the Caribbean estimates that poverty will affect nearly 40% of

211
00:13:10.711 --> 00:13:15.450
the population. By the end of the year, Friends,

212
00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:19.650
the situation in Argentina is beginning to be so extreme that a spike in cases

213
00:13:19.651 --> 00:13:23.610
of depression and anxiety at crisis level has already been detected.

214
00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:27.690
<v 4>At the beginning of the quarantine, six out of 10, Argentines had mild,</v>

215
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.840
moderate or severe symptoms of anxiety over the course of days,

216
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:31.980
the symptoms remained,

217
00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:35.460
but the anguish turned into depression where you're seeing an epidemic of mental

218
00:13:35.461 --> 00:13:40.290
illness today. We Argentines are exhausted for Cuno monies.

219
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.510
<v 1>And this is not all to do with the political,</v>

220
00:13:42.511 --> 00:13:45.390
social and economic backdrop in the land of tango.

221
00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:48.120
There is another point that is also very controversial,

222
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:50.880
the way the pandemic has been co-opted for ideological.

223
00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:58.530
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

224
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.110
<v 1>You explained the Fernandez government and many unions,</v>

225
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.560
especially those of civil servants have wanted to get a piece of the action.

226
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:08.070
You know, and if you don't, I'll tell you that in Argentina,

227
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.230
even soup is political and this event was.

228
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.273
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

229
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.830
<v 1>The Argentinian government and its allies did something that should never be</v>

230
00:14:16.831 --> 00:14:18.420
done in this type of crisis.

231
00:14:18.421 --> 00:14:22.320
They sought an electoral advantage at any price in this case,

232
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:25.980
a quick way to dump responsibilities and score and advantage for their political

233
00:14:25.981 --> 00:14:29.010
campaign. You see, after the general confinement was decreed,

234
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.710
the government slogan was the state is taking care of you,

235
00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:34.830
which already made its intentions clear, but they didn't stop there.

236
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.910
Another idea that they tried to spread was that this pandemic showed the market

237
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.320
was an enemy to be beaten.

238
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.950
And some sectors of the government even described COVID-19 as a disease that

239
00:14:43.951 --> 00:14:45.180
could be blamed on the rich,

240
00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.610
because of course they said that by traveling abroad,

241
00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.600
they had to have brought it back.

242
00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:54.110
<v 0>Yeah, [inaudible].</v>

243
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:01.300
<v 5>[Inaudible].</v>

244
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.133
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

245
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:06.700
<v 1>It is hard to believe that we are talking about Argentina,</v>

246
00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.850
a country that was once one of the major players in world market.

247
00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:17.080
This is the price of low-cost populism, economic crisis,

248
00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:18.790
political and social confrontation,

249
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.120
potential hyperinflation in the making and the feeling that the government has

250
00:15:22.121 --> 00:15:25.720
no plan for getting out of this whole friends. Unfortunately,

251
00:15:25.721 --> 00:15:29.590
things in Argentina look worse than ever from here. We have no other choice,

252
00:15:29.591 --> 00:15:33.310
but to send good luck and a lot of encouragement to all of you who are watching

253
00:15:33.311 --> 00:15:35.740
us from Argentina, from all of the visual politic team,

254

Hopefully we will soon be able to tell different stories about this country.

256
00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.500
And at this point it's all over to you.

257
00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.260
