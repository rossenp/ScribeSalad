I'll leave you the link in the description,

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.460
but now let's get into today's video.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.283
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.490
<v 0>As we've told you, in previous videos on the 30th of June, 2020,</v>

9
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.400
everything changed in Hong Kong on that day or Tuesday,

10
00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:37.220
that will go down in history as a sad day for democracy,

11
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.970
the Chinese communist party and the model once. And for all,

12
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.420
they said goodbye to the policy of one country, two systems.

13
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.500
It did not do so as some expected through a shocking occupation of troops or

14
00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:50.780
military force, but rather by way of agree,

15
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.420
vote in the national people's Congress standing committee,

16
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.410
which is the parliament of China that vote ratified the entry into force of a

17
00:00:57.411 --> 00:00:59.600
new security law. In the former British club,

18
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.890
We are talking about a new law that in practice has put an end to freedom of

19
00:01:06.891 --> 00:01:10.820
speech demonstration and political association among other things.

20
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.760
These were previously held the rights that had made Hong Kong.

21
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.170
One of the freest territories on the planet for decades as a result from the

22
00:01:18.171 --> 00:01:20.420
1st of July, any social media platform,

23
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.470
traditional media agency publishing company or educational center has been in

24
00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:27.170
the spotlight of the Chinese dictatorship. To give you an idea.

25
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.033
We have this law,

26
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.730
which will be applied by courts and special security forces and controlled

27
00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:32.870
directly by Beijing.

28
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.980
Any action that the Chinese regime considers to promote sedition, subversion,

29
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.731
separatism,

30
00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:41.930
or collusion with foreign forces could end in harsh prison terms and even life

31
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.213
imprisonment.

32
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.630
<v 1>Friends.</v>

33
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.140
<v 0>The security law is a blank check for the Chinese government to pursue any</v>

34
00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:54.710
person or movement in Hong Kong that is inconvenient for them.

35
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.270
And as you can imagine, China,

36
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.050
hasn't held back and using this law repression and fear are two factors that

37
00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:03.770
have now become part of everyday life in the South China sea enclave.

38
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.940
The new policy of both Beijing and the local authorities is to crack down firmly

39
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.670
on any show of this scent. Wait a minute. You don't believe me.

40
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.320
Do you really think I'm exaggerating well,

41
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.220
pay attention to the kind of headlines that have become commonplace in Hong Kong

42
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:17.600
these days? Huh?

43
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.670
<v 2>Joshua Wong and Agnes ciao jailed for protest roles, democracy,</v>

44
00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:23.480
activists,

45
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.220
face months behind bars with more charges pending Asia Nikkei review

46
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.030
seven pro democratic lawmakers arrested in Hong Kong.

47
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.860
Asia Nikkei review used to see books critical of the authorities in Hong Kong.

48
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.380
Such books are now no longer seen in the bookstores.

49
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.700
You already Suzuki senior partner at law firm at Sumi and Sockeye.

50
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.500
The last time I saw many of my social media friends online was June 30th.

51
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.890
The day Beijing passed a national security law for Hong Kong.

52
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.070
My friend list is shortened and some reappeared with names that I did not

53
00:02:55.071 --> 00:02:59.980
recognize many removed their accounts out of fear that they may be for even the

54
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:03.430
smallest slight against the government. Nicole Lou Ft.

55
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.320
<v 0>Porter friends, since the start of the mass protests in 2019,</v>

56
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.400
almost 10,000 people have been arrested and thousands prosecuted. However,

57
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.810
since the new national security law went into effect, things have gotten much.

58
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.223
<v 1>Yes.</v>

59
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.990
<v 0>Give you an idea. Since the new law came into effect,</v>

60
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.960
dozens of key pro democracy figures have been arrested,

61
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.030
including several legislators in August.

62
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.100
The police raided the offices of Apple daily.

63
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.550
One of the few media outlets not controlled by Beijing, Jimmy Lee,

64
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.830
the newspapers founder, along with eight others,

65
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.010
including two of his sons were arrested under the new security law.

66
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.830
And on the 2nd of December, or authorities denied Jimmy Lee,

67
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.740
even provisional freedom. On the 3rd of September 12,

68
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.190
pro-democracy activists were captured by the Chinese coast guard whilst

69
00:03:47.191 --> 00:03:51.360
attempting a dramatic boat escape to Taiwan. The youngest was only 16 years old

70
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.480
And friends.

71
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.140
These are just three examples of what the new normality is for Hong Kong is,

72
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.420
but wait a moment, because this is not the end of it.

73
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.821
12th of November,

74
00:04:05.821 --> 00:04:09.270
the Chinese authorities gave a new turn of the screw to this whole affair.

75
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.870
They authorized the Hong Kong government to permanently expel any legislator,

76
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.410
IE,

77
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.010
any member of parliament who is not considered sufficiently patriotic and most

78
00:04:17.011 --> 00:04:20.910
strikingly. This expulsion order does not have to go through the local courts.

79
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.730
In other words, now the executive authority of Hong Kong,

80
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.180
which is elected by the Chinese government and which is currently led by Ms.

81
00:04:27.181 --> 00:04:29.760
Carrie Lam can expel from the Hong Kong parliament,

82
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.410
any MPS that are inconvenient to them all with complete impunity and without any

83
00:04:34.411 --> 00:04:37.950
judicial backing. So just minutes after this new rule went into effect,

84
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.220
four members of the opposition were expelled from parliament. In other words,

85
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.310
there is no longer any room for the opposition in the Hong Kong parliaments.

86
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.940
<v 2>The government can now remove any face it wants from the parliament.</v>

87
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.790
There will be no future for this legislature, Kenneth and Leon,

88
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.320
one of the expelled MPS.

89
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.770
<v 0>The top it all off in her last annual policy speech, Hong Kong's,</v>

90
00:04:55.771 --> 00:04:58.410
chief executive, Carrie Lam called the security law,

91
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.980
remarkably effective and pledged to promote patriotic education.

92
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.020
You can imagine what that means, but all this,

93
00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:07.140
my friends is something that we have talked more or less about already.

94
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.890
And I am very sure, very sure that very few of you will find it strange,

95
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.390
but the real questions are what are consequences of this political interference?

96
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.620
What are the strengths of this increasingly less autonomous region and the most

97
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:22.830
important question of all? What does China expect to need from Hong Kong?

98
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:23.783
Listen up.

99
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.410
<v 1>The wall street of Asia.</v>

100
00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.890
<v 0>Friends,</v>

101
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.730
the former British colony became an important enclave during the 20th century,

102
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.120
not only a commercial one, but above all a financial one.

103
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.430
It's the legal system inspired by the British model,

104
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.110
which gave a lot of legal security,

105
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.900
enormous freedom of movement for people to capital and goods,

106
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.620
low taxes and English as the working language would just some of the elements

107
00:05:52.621 --> 00:05:56.010
that catapulted it to the top of the international financial rankings.

108
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.810
That's not all the spectacular takeoff of the Chinese economy over the past

109
00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:02.690
decades. You will soon see why has made Hong Kong.

110
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:06.800
The world's most important international financial center just behind New York

111
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.270
and London in 2019,

112
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.600
the Hong Kong stock exchange was the one that raised the most money with new

113
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:15.110
market outlets. It was placed above both the NASDAQ and the New York stock.

114
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.103
<v 1>Okay. Exchange.</v>

115
00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.590
<v 0>In 2020, things are not much different.</v>

116
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.040
The Hong Kong stock exchange and the NASDAQ compete hand in hand for the

117
00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.323
symbolic first place.

118
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.210
<v 1>And there's a good.</v>

119
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.560
<v 0>For all of this. As you will know,</v>

120
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.610
Hong Kong has been a part of China since 1997. However, as you also know,

121
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.360
it's international status has been an independent country in practice.

122
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.140
For example,

123
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.470
the 1992 Hong Kong policy act of the United States made to this territory,

124
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.000
a separate customs area from mainland China for all the years,

125
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.970
since the act and guaranteed currency comfortability.

126
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.490
And this is not the only regulation that exists.

127
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.920
Many agreements have shaped Hong Kong. For example,

128
00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.270
the sec wall street security supervisor has an enforcement agreement with its

129
00:07:01.271 --> 00:07:02.410
Hong Kong counterpart.

130
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.770
Many regulations are similar and it's financial derivatives companies are

131
00:07:05.771 --> 00:07:09.910
treated by us agencies virtually as if they were local companies. In fact,

132
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.360
most banking and financial supervisors around the world treat Hong Kong

133
00:07:13.361 --> 00:07:16.600
institutions almost as if they were based in Frankfurt itself.

134
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.630
All this has created a unique and highly competitive ecosystem.

135
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:23.380
<v 1>Perhaps.</v>

136
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.820
<v 0>The most important feature, however,</v>

137
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:29.710
is that it is the most prominent dollar funding center in all of Asia since 1983

138
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.770
it's currency. The Hong Kong dollar has been pegged to the us dollar,

139
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.220
a bond backed by reserves of more than $400 billion.

140
00:07:36.221 --> 00:07:38.920
Put another way if you want, or need dollars in Asia,

141
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.600
Hong Kong is your go-to place.

142
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:45.880
<v 1>Well.</v>

143
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.850
<v 0>It has all the characteristics that we have mentioned that explained why this</v>

144
00:07:48.851 --> 00:07:51.070
small enclave is such a bustling place.

145
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.880
Especially if we're talking about money with just over 7.5 million inhabitants,

146
00:07:54.881 --> 00:07:59.020
163 different banks. Most of them international are established in Hong Kong.

147
00:07:59.080 --> 00:07:59.590
Of course,

148
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.980
practically all the large entities in the world have operations in this place.

149
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:07.960
13% of all employment and 26% of its economy comes from the financial industry.

150
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:11.200
Now having said that there are some essential questions that we have to answer.

151
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.210
What role does Hong Kong play for China?

152
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.990
How important is the city for the economy of the Asian giant and take notes?

153
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.560
Because these two questions may have much more important implications than you

154
00:08:20.561 --> 00:08:21.550
can imagine. Listen up.

155
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.160
<v 1>How much does trynna need Hong Kong.</v>

156
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.261
<v 0>Friends?</v>

157
00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:35.650
It appears that the importance that Hong Kong has in the Chinese economy has

158
00:08:35.651 --> 00:08:40.120
been reduced a lot over the last three decades. After all, if in 1993,

159
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:44.290
Hong Kong represented 27% of all China's GDP today,

160
00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:47.350
that figure is less than 3%. In fact, in 2019,

161
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.350
the GDP of Shenzhen province exceeded that of Hong Kong.

162
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.210
Hold on a moment because the implements,

163
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.830
the significance of this special administrative region manifests itself in a

164
00:08:58.831 --> 00:09:02.340
very different way while Hong Kong is becoming more and more Chinese,

165
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.420
its institutions have so far been left virtually equivalent to those of a

166
00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:10.050
Western economy. I'm referring to examples of the courts, the regulators,

167
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.430
and the monetary authority.

168
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.000
All of these institutions have been functioning independently and effectively

169
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:17.970
for decades. And it's not just about public institutions.

170
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.500
This city is also full as a city like London is of all kinds of professionals

171
00:09:22.501 --> 00:09:26.700
linked to the financial world who are highly specialized from law firms to asset

172
00:09:26.701 --> 00:09:30.600
managers, analysts, and FinTech technologies. Thanks precisely to this.

173
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.990
Hong Kong has become something like a bridge between two very different worlds

174
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.030
on the one hand, the Western world and on the other,

175
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.790
the prosperous world of the new.

176
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:38.743
<v 1>China.</v>

177
00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.460
<v 0>All the Western financial system is categorized by free capital flows,</v>

178
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:49.040
free dissemination of information and legal security.

179
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.860
Things are quite different. Still in China.

180
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.980
The control was on capital movements are still enormous while, well,

181
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.350
let's say that China is not famous for its legacy.

182
00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:58.723
<v 1>Currency.</v>

183
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.960
<v 0>Like any other dictatorship.</v>

184
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.050
Really the fact is that precisely because of these differences,

185
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.450
Hong Kong plays a double role. On the one hand,

186
00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.510
it is the main gateway to mainland China for foreign investment.

187
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.150
Not the other hand. It is the place where Chinese companies,

188
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.900
including the big public companies raise funds, particularly of course,

189
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:21.020
in us dollars. Remember that to conduct international operations,

190
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.950
having the dollar bills of the American empire is almost indispensable well in

191
00:10:24.951 --> 00:10:27.530
the same way, if you were looking for you and to invest in China,

192
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.800
and you want to be able to change them with some freedom and have guarantees and

193
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.330
liquid security, Hong Kong,

194
00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:34.910
exactly the door that you have to knock on because friends,

195
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.480
this city is not only the most important dollar financing center in Asia.

196
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:42.350
It is also the largest market for you ban outside, mainland China in the world.

197
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:47.443
<v 1>Sauce.</v>

198
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.680
<v 0>Hong Kong is financial district is the place where entrepreneurs and technology</v>

199
00:10:51.681 --> 00:10:55.550
leaders in China make agreements with us hedge funds to raise financing.

200
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:56.660
While at the same time,

201
00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:00.320
the large public banks in China issued bonds to finance new projects,

202
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:01.580
such as the new silk road.

203
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.120
It is also the place where dozens and dozens of Chinese companies are listed

204
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:09.260
including 421 companies controlled by the Chinese government itself.

205
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.130
At the end of the day,

206
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.790
being listed in Hong Kong means opening the door to investors and capital from

207
00:11:13.791 --> 00:11:14.630
all over the world.

208
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:18.920
To give you an idea of the almost $75 billion that Chinese companies raised on

209
00:11:18.921 --> 00:11:22.280
stock exchanges during 2019 about half came from the city.

210
00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:27.110
And this also explains why more than 70% of the total capitalization in the Hong

211
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:28.820
Kong stock exchange corresponds to Chinese.

212
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:29.713
<v 1>Companies.</v>

213
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:31.961
<v 0>Well,</v>

214
00:11:31.961 --> 00:11:35.420
the Chinese use this market to collect many savings and Chinese companies use it

215
00:11:35.421 --> 00:11:37.670
to attract money investments and partners,

216
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.650
as well as to finance their projects abroad.

217
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:43.280
International investors also use it as a gateway to the Chinese giant,

218
00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:47.240
according to data from Morgan Stanley in 2018, for example,

219
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:51.560
more than 60% of foreign direct investment in the Asian giant was channeled from

220
00:11:51.561 --> 00:11:55.660
here from this city, from central, from the financial district of Hong Kong,

221
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:56.860
more than 60%.

222
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.760
So you see in a way Hong Kong is still indispensable to China.

223
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:04.300
Let's just say that eroding financial strength could lead to many problems for

224
00:12:04.301 --> 00:12:07.570
Beijing on a moment that could happen with everything we told you at the

225
00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:08.950
beginning of the video, couldn't it.

226
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.300
<v 2>From global city to Chinese Ford.</v>

227
00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.350
<v 0>Friends could have Hong Kong financial analyst question,</v>

228
00:12:25.351 --> 00:12:28.980
a large public company under the new rules. Could investors trust the courts?

229
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.980
If they are confronted with someone close to the Chinese communist party,

230
00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:35.280
could economic information or analysis critical of the government to be

231
00:12:35.281 --> 00:12:36.000
prosecuted,

232
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.360
could China make it harder to get free access to the web in Hong Kong?

233
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:40.860
If it did get prosecuted,

234
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:44.070
will senior professionals feel comfortable about accepting less freedom of

235
00:12:44.071 --> 00:12:48.210
speech? What will happen to savings in the face of reduced legal security,

236
00:12:48.211 --> 00:12:50.880
be careful friends. These are not minor questions.

237
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.210
This is the new scenario Hong Kong is facing. And particularly so,

238
00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.740
and its famous financial center.

239
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:00.630
For example,

240
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:04.170
according to some surveys published after the security law was announced many

241
00:13:04.171 --> 00:13:07.710
companies, most of them believe that this new law would affect them negatively.

242
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.790
A survey conducted in early August by the American chamber of commerce in Hong

243
00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.810
Kong found that 75% of respondents were pessimistic about the business prospects

244
00:13:15.811 --> 00:13:20.040
in the city and nearly 40% plans to move their capital operations or assets.

245
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:23.130
<v 1>Yep.</v>

246
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.970
<v 0>And what happened with ant financial, for example, on 5th of November, 2020,</v>

247
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.510
this company, which is something like the financial subsidiary of Alibaba,

248
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.120
we've due to start trading on the Hong Kong stock exchange.

249
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:36.390
It was the biggest IPO in the history of the planet. However,

250
00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:39.270
a few days prior in late October its founder,

251
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.680
Jack ma was critical of the Chinese government at a financial forum in Shanghai.

252
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.930
Well, do you know what happened overnight?

253
00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.680
The Chinese government suspended the IPO of this giant value to hundreds of

254
00:13:49.681 --> 00:13:52.200
billions of us dollars. According to speculation,

255
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.870
it was using pink himself who made the decision.

256
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.140
And of course that doesn't seem like the best way to win the trust of investors

257
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.560
or to show that things in the new Hong Kong are going to run smoothly. Now,

258
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:02.463
does it

259
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.710
Friends, the future of Hong Kong,

260
00:14:07.711 --> 00:14:11.370
particularly it's positioned as an international financial center is far from

261
00:14:11.371 --> 00:14:15.210
clear. Everything indicates that it will gradually become more Chinese and less

262
00:14:15.211 --> 00:14:16.044
international.

263
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.630
<v 2>I don't know what the future of Hong Kong is going to be,</v>

264
00:14:18.631 --> 00:14:21.810
but I'm pretty sure it won't be a global financial center.

265
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:25.200
Hong Kong is now the financial center of China, which is somewhat different.

266
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:29.820
Alicia Garcia, Ferrero, chief economists for the Asia Pacific at [inaudible].

267
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.870
<v 0>But of course, even if this were the case, it would still be bad for China.</v>

268
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.720
It would weaken its financial connection with the rest of the world.

269
00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.260
It could reduce the number of investment secured limit access to dollars and

270
00:14:40.261 --> 00:14:42.360
increase the cost of capital for its companies.

271
00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.360
That is the great risk that the Chinese government now faces,

272
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.850
although they publicly express a somewhat different idea.

273
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:52.910
<v 2>What China Hong Kong and the international community most from Hong Kong is</v>

274
00:14:52.911 --> 00:14:57.380
stability at a return to order if law and order can be maintained.

275
00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:01.550
There will be great interest around the world and continuing to invest in this

276
00:15:01.551 --> 00:15:05.540
region as investors seek rapid growth and quick returns,

277
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.710
long way out advisor to the Chinese central government and president of the

278
00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:11.900
center for China and globalization.

279
00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.650
<v 0>See in Beijing, they believe that by keeping things calm,</v>

280
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.860
Hong Kong will not suffer, or at least it won't suffer much,

281
00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.550
which may or may not be true in any case. That's the way things are.

282
00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.400
And the question that comes up is, is there a plan B? Yes,

283
00:15:24.401 --> 00:15:26.680
there is that that has a lot to do with Macau,

284
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.440
but that's a topic for a future video here on visual politics.
