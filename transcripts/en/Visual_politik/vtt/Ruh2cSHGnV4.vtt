00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.043
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.380
<v 1>The Walt Disney company is the world's largest communication and entertainment.</v>

3
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.243
<v 0>Company.</v>

4
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.910
<v 1>We're talking about a whole empire that under normal conditions has more than</v>

5
00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:30.470
200,000 employees and whose enterprise value that is the market value of its

6
00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:31.070
assets.

7
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.970
A figure which take into account both shares and net debt amounts to almost

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.520
$300 billion. To give you an idea.

9
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.530
This means that at the time of making this video,

10
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.350
Disney was one of the 30 largest companies in the world.

11
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.213
<v 0>Well.</v>

12
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.590
<v 1>Founded on October 16th, 1923.</v>

13
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.920
This multinational in the world of entertainment has become almost a hundred

14
00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:55.040
years later, not only one of the great icons of American culture,

15
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.340
but also an emporiums that controls television stations, film,

16
00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:00.740
and television production, theme parks, cruise ships,

17
00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:04.970
and even its own streaming distribution platforms and emporiums that in

18
00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:09.860
2019 alone had a turnover of almost $70 billion and a tax-free profit

19
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.900
of just over $11 billion.

20
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.710
<v 0>By the way.</v>

21
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.790
<v 1>A curious fact,</v>

22
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.200
can you tell me who the first character created by Disney was? No,

23
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.430
I'm sorry, but almost everyone thinks so, but it wasn't Mickey mouse,

24
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.770
but rather Oswald the lucky rabbit.

25
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.990
<v 0>But.</v>

26
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.550
<v 1>Well, that's another story for another time.</v>

27
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.810
The fact is that in 2019 Disney had one of the most momentous years in its

28
00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:38.180
entire history. On 20th of March,

29
00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:42.950
they signed off on a deal valued at some $70 billion to take over 21st century

30
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:45.470
Fox, a major entertainment holding company,

31
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.400
An acquisition that has given Disney control of the well-known 20th century Fox

32
00:01:52.401 --> 00:01:56.180
film and television studios with its entire catalog of productions,

33
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.500
including channels such as FX and national geographic sagas and series like

34
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.360
avatar alien and the Simpsons and streaming platforms like MDs hot star

35
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.860
among many other assets.

36
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.460
And that's not the end of it just a few months later in November,

37
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.180
2019 Disney plus it's long awaited video on demand service. Again,

38
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.290
it's launch that is Disney created its own Netflix, Walt business,

39
00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:23.360
big gamble for the coming years.

40
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.400
These operations were piloted by Bob Iger who until February,

41
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.550
2020 held the position of CEO and is currently chairman of the board of

42
00:02:34.551 --> 00:02:38.630
directors considered one of the most powerful men in Hollywood since he took

43
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.570
over Disney. This company has made key acquisitions,

44
00:02:41.571 --> 00:02:44.780
such as the Pixar animation studios, the comic book company,

45
00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:48.920
Marvel and Lucas film, the producer of the star Wars saga, all of that,

46
00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:49.400
of course,

47
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.720
in addition to the purchase of 21st century Fox and the launch of Disney plus

48
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.500
that we have.

49
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.680
<v 0>You mentioned, however.</v>

50
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.810
<v 1>Afterward 2019 with the good news for the company, we have moved on to 20,</v>

51
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:05.860
20 a year in which everything has gone wrong as a result of the coronavirus.

52
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.790
And he has been hit hard by the measures taken to combat the pandemic it's

53
00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:13.350
theme, parks, hotels, cruise ships,

54
00:03:13.351 --> 00:03:16.560
and resorts have had to close or operate at a minimum.

55
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.350
And the movie theaters have not fared much better either.

56
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.660
<v 0>In spite of.</v>

57
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.800
<v 1>All this Disney remains one of the favorite bets of many long-term investors.</v>

58
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.030
But when you think about it,

59
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.740
this is to be expected historically it has been a solid money-making machine for

60
00:03:31.741 --> 00:03:32.574
its shareholders.

61
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.130
<v 0>Wow.</v>

62
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.880
<v 1>The fact is that recent events have made us here at visual politic taken notice</v>

63
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.710
and this new collaboration with value score.

64
00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.900
We have asked ourselves a few questions.

65
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.870
What's can we expect from Disney in the next few years?

66
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.960
Why do longterm investors still gravitate to this company so much?

67
00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.100
How will the Corona virus affected? What are his great assets for the future?

68
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.070
Well, in this video, we are going to answer all these questions,

69
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.840
but first of all, let's get to know exactly what business this company is doing.

70
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.260
<v 0>A business empire built on four pillars.</v>

71
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.260
<v 1>Friends, the Walt Disney companies, empire rests on four great pillars.</v>

72
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.310
If we rank them by turnover in their last year using 2019 as an example, yeah,

73
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.390
this would be the order. Firstly, with an income of just over $26 billion,

74
00:04:27.391 --> 00:04:30.660
we find the division compromising theme, parks, hotels, cruises,

75
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.990
and the sale of products and licenses among the most important assets that they

76
00:04:33.991 --> 00:04:38.130
either own or license are the world famous Disneyland parks in California,

77
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.740
Paris, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Tokyo.

78
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.950
Plus of course the Walt Disney world resort in Orlando, Florida,

79
00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.690
the largest entertainment complex in.

80
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.523
<v 0>The world.</v>

81
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.510
<v 1>We are talking about a complex that has an area of just over a hundred</v>

82
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.370
kilometers square houses for amusement parks, two water parks, six golf courses,

83
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.440
several shopping centers, sports centers,

84
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.330
and 27 vacation resorts with more than 30,000 rooms to give you an idea of

85
00:05:03.331 --> 00:05:05.310
the enormous dimensions that we're talking about.

86
00:05:05.311 --> 00:05:10.050
30,000 rooms are equivalent to more than half of all hotel rooms in the state of

87
00:05:10.051 --> 00:05:14.280
Hawaii. This division,

88
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.660
which in addition to the theme,

89
00:05:15.661 --> 00:05:20.640
parks also includes Disney's cruise ships and resorts has soaked up 75%

90
00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:23.940
of all Disney's investment budget in recent years. And as you can imagine,

91
00:05:23.941 --> 00:05:27.300
it has been the business segment most effected by the Corona virus during the

92
00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:30.630
second quarter of 2020 sales from this pillar fell by 85.

93
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.680
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

94
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.180
<v 1>Second on the list by income, we have the media division,</v>

95
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.450
perhaps the least known, but currently most profitable arm of the company.

96
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.600
This includes cable television channels, such as ESPN, FX,

97
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.050
national geographic and others, the commercial television business of ABC,

98
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.950
one of the three largest channels in the United States and local television

99
00:05:52.951 --> 00:05:55.920
stations, such as KABC in Los Angeles,

100
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.300
w ABC in New York or w L S N.

101
00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.243
<v 0>Chicago.</v>

102
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.760
<v 1>With a turnover of around $24.8 billion and an operating profit of almost</v>

103
00:06:06.761 --> 00:06:10.990
$7.5 billion. This division is the most profitable in the group. However,

104
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:12.250
there is a slight problem.

105
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.820
The growing popularity of streaming services presents tough competition that

106
00:06:15.821 --> 00:06:19.510
raises many questions about the future viability and profitability of these

107
00:06:19.511 --> 00:06:23.290
existing services. In fact,

108
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.020
this is one of the main bounce that exists among many investors,

109
00:06:26.021 --> 00:06:29.470
but we'll talk about that a little later on for the moment let's continue in

110
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.510
third place are the film studios,

111
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:34.930
the production and distribution of the works created by Walt Disney pictures,

112
00:06:34.931 --> 00:06:37.900
20th century, Fox Marvel, Lucasfilm Pixar,

113
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.400
and some other smaller studios generated revenues of more than $11 billion

114
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.540
against an operating profit of about $2.5 billion for the group and 2019.

115
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.530
<v 0>And finally.</v>

116
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.950
<v 1>We have the division that includes streaming services, the Juul of the crown,</v>

117
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.710
the most promising bet for the future of this company. And take note,

118
00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.400
because we are talking about one of the most influential groups in the world in

119
00:07:00.401 --> 00:07:03.400
just a few months since it's launched and before it was even launched in many

120
00:07:03.401 --> 00:07:06.070
markets, such as Latin America or the Nordic countries,

121
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.630
Disney plus had already exceeded 60 million subscribers by the end of August,

122
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:15.340
2020, But it's not just Disney.

123
00:07:15.341 --> 00:07:18.940
Plus if we also take into account the other streaming services controlled by the

124
00:07:18.941 --> 00:07:21.100
company such as Hulu and ESPN,

125
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:25.390
plus then the number of active subscribers exceeds a hundred million and that's

126
00:07:25.391 --> 00:07:28.240
not counting hot star, a popular service in India.

127
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.900
This makes Disney the second largest group of pet streaming video platforms

128
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.650
after Netflix. The problem with this division is that at present,

129
00:07:35.651 --> 00:07:39.100
it is not focused on making money. It is focused on grubbing at all.

130
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:39.993
<v 0>Costs.</v>

131
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:49.660
[inaudible].

132
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.220
<v 1>How will we know how this company is structured?</v>

133
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.550
How about we take a look at the stocks and the main concerns and hopes of

134
00:07:54.551 --> 00:07:56.290
investors that have been published so far.

135
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.540
What is the future of Disney as an investment.

136
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:03.520
<v 0>Psychological threats and hopes for a change of model.</v>

137
00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.920
<v 1>Black, the rest of the market during 2020 Disney shares have taken a beating,</v>

138
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:09.970
but as you can see,

139
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.900
even those size coronavirus to cause the revenues of its largest division,

140
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:15.670
the vacation resort, theme park,

141
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.340
and cruise ship division to plummet during the pandemic,

142
00:08:18.341 --> 00:08:19.540
the share prices hardly.

143
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:21.063
<v 0>Unaffected.</v>

144
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.020
<v 1>At the time of preparing this video business shares were trading at almost the</v>

145
00:08:26.021 --> 00:08:30.940
same level as exactly one year ago, in a way,

146
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.390
the strong recovery that the shares have experienced since their lows in March

147
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:38.650
has had a lot to do with the strong evolution that their streaming service is

148
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.660
registering. And it's just one or two years ago,

149
00:08:40.661 --> 00:08:43.750
there had been doubts about Disney's ability to adapt to the times. Now,

150
00:08:43.751 --> 00:08:47.470
all those concerns seem to have disappeared in a world where more and more

151
00:08:47.471 --> 00:08:48.610
content is consumed.

152
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.880
Disney is the King of production far ahead of the rest of the year.

153
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.040
<v 0>Competition, but it's not.</v>

154
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.360
<v 1>Just about production anymore.</v>

155
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:00.900
Now it's about direct distribution via streaming platforms.

156
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.230
Remember that in just one year Disney streaming services have reached more than

157
00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:06.810
60 million new subscribers. And the question is,

158
00:09:06.811 --> 00:09:10.710
can it continue at this rate to become number one and unseat the powerful

159
00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:13.710
Netflix? I remember this is not a trivial question.

160
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:21.110
Let's look at it this way. At the time of making this video early September,

161
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.170
2020,

162
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:25.400
the market value of Netflix is almost the same as that of the entire Walt Disney

163
00:09:25.401 --> 00:09:26.210
corporation.

164
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.660
That's despite the fact that Disney has many more lines of business and much

165
00:09:29.661 --> 00:09:32.480
larger and more valuable library of content. In fact,

166
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.490
according to Macquarie research estimates,

167
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.040
that analysis unit of the Macquarie investment bank,

168
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.880
the projections for next year are that Disney will achieve about 60% of the

169
00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:43.400
total turnover of Netflix with its streaming services.

170
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:50.390
As we have seen Disney produces much more content, for example,

171
00:09:50.391 --> 00:09:51.440
for its television channels,

172
00:09:51.441 --> 00:09:54.590
content that it can potentially market through its own platforms.

173
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.430
This provides smart economies of scale and another very important factor,

174
00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.100
no other content company, absolutely none.

175
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.330
Other has the ability that Disney has to monetize its content through its theme,

176
00:10:05.331 --> 00:10:08.960
parks merchandising and its hotels, et cetera, et cetera.

177
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.220

<v 2>2020,</v>

180

Disney's a massive new star Wars hotel will begin taking reservations later this

181
00:10:18.621 --> 00:10:19.160
year.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.300
You will live a board, a star cruiser,

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:34.220
and you will be able to immerse yourself in the history of star Wars and Mauro

187
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.260
<v 1>Another good example can be found with the launch of moonshine,</v>

188
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:46.100
an animated film that will be available to Disney plus subscribers upon payment

189
00:10:46.101 --> 00:10:49.010
of a feed that in the United States will be around $30.

<v 1>Other words, thanks to the enormous popularity of its characters.</v>

192
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.290
Walt Disney is going to do something relatively new combine,

193
00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:01.160
the subscription revenues of streaming platforms with the pay-per-view model.

194
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.730
Are you direct sales of new content on the same platform? Okay.

195
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.590
We don't know if it will work or not,

196
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:10.130
but what I can tell you is that it's a clear example of how the Burbank

197
00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.520
California headquarters are thinking about how to squeeze every last dollar.

198
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:19.850
<v 2>These businesses like Marvel and star Wars are movie and television businesses,</v>

199
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.780
but they are also big consumer product drivers and have a growing presence in

200
00:11:23.781 --> 00:11:27.620
parks and resorts. Bob Iger, chairman of the board of Disney.

201
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.200
<v 1>The fact is that this is not an issue that Netflix has yet to resolve,</v>

202
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:36.890
not being able to create and consolidate characters that can generate income

203
00:11:36.891 --> 00:11:39.380
beyond the streaming quota. Now, that being said,

204
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:41.960
does that mean everything looks set for Disney? Well,

205
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:46.040
no many investors also have doubts, not about the company's business model,

206
00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:48.200
but about its possible returns. You know,

207
00:11:48.201 --> 00:11:51.950
that not every good company is necessarily a good investment.

208
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.480
So what are objections well beyond the coronavirus?

209
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.370
It mainly has to do with the change of model.

210
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.310
Let me explain. As we have seen so far,

211
00:12:02.311 --> 00:12:05.640
the most profitable division of the group has been the media cable,

212
00:12:05.641 --> 00:12:07.770
television and commercial television. Well,

213
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.640
the fact is that this division along with the film production and distribution

214
00:12:11.641 --> 00:12:16.080
division plus movie theaters or third chains counted for more than 50% of the

215
00:12:16.081 --> 00:12:20.670
revenue and almost 70% of all the groups profits in 2019 and friends,

216
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.760
we are talking about two business units that are beginning to suffer from the

217
00:12:23.761 --> 00:12:24.630
arrival of streaming.

218
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:25.493
<v 0>Platforms.</v>

219
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.460
<v 1>Well, TV providers are losing subscribers.</v>

220
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.960
Cinemas are losing clients and advertisers on commercial TV are moving to other

221
00:12:33.961 --> 00:12:36.060
forms of digital media. And the question,

222
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.870
the big question is will Disney achieve equivalent levels of profitability?

223
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:41.040
Take a look at this chart.

224
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.070
<v 0>For example, as you can see.</v>

225
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.550
<v 1>During 2019 and the first nine months of 2020,</v>

226
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:52.200
the return on invested capital has plummeted after 20 years of almost continuous

227
00:12:52.201 --> 00:12:52.531
growth.

228
00:12:52.531 --> 00:12:57.270
The R O I C of 2019 and 2020 has dropped back to the levels of the

229
00:12:57.271 --> 00:13:00.840
beginning of this century. And no, it's not just about the Corona virus.

230
00:13:00.841 --> 00:13:05.190
The 2019 figure is very representative. The point is that at this point in time,

231
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:08.700
the business of streaming platforms is a loss making business and is subject to

232
00:13:08.701 --> 00:13:13.500
fierce competition and rising costs. Netflix, Amazon prime, Disney plus HBO,

233
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.330
Apple DV film in sky,

234
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:18.270
there are more and more platforms competing with each other.

235
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:19.830
I'm willing to pay more for content,

236
00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:23.970
which obviously narrows the margins and take note because market studies warn

237
00:13:23.971 --> 00:13:26.430
that the price variable is very important for customers,

238
00:13:26.431 --> 00:13:28.320
the most important variable of all.

239
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:30.930
<v 0>So.</v>

240
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.840
<v 1>In a nutshell, no one doubts the future of Disney as a company,</v>

241
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.470
but there is a certain fear that the change of model will end up meaning

242
00:13:37.471 --> 00:13:41.070
changing a profitable business with good margins into one that is not so

243
00:13:41.071 --> 00:13:41.730
lucrative.

244
00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.670
It's even more of a concern when some of the biggest players in the industry

245
00:13:44.671 --> 00:13:48.840
like Amazon or Apple don't even have the clout to make money with this business.

246
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.320
They accept running them at a loss in order to attract customers to their other

247
00:13:52.321 --> 00:13:54.630
features. And that, that complicates everything.

248
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:58.320
<v 0>I think even more [inaudible].</v>

249
00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:59.190
<v 1>Then again,</v>

250
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:03.030
the purchase of 21st century Fox coupled with the Corona virus have caused the

251
00:14:03.031 --> 00:14:07.410
company's net debts to skyrocket just at a time when it seems its profits maybe

252
00:14:07.411 --> 00:14:10.770
starting to shrink at least for awhile. Well, these are my friends,

253
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.640
the two points put forward the most often by those who have some reticence

254
00:14:14.641 --> 00:14:16.320
concerning this company in short,

255
00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:20.160
our goal with this video was to present you closer to Disney and present you

256
00:14:20.161 --> 00:14:24.420
with the ups and downs of an extraordinary company whose future seems at least

257
00:14:24.421 --> 00:14:28.500
as good as its past, but now I'm shining the spotlight on you. Yes,

258
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:30.510
that's right. You, what do you think of Disney?

259
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:34.050
Do you think it can generate returns as good as those it has generated in the

260
00:14:34.051 --> 00:14:37.470
past? Come on, take a stab and leave us your opinion in the comments.
