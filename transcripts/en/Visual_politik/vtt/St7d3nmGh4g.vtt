00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.150
<v 0>Hi, I'm grant I'm back with visual politic. I'm bold, I'm British.</v>

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.940
And unlike the previous host of this channel, I can't grow a beard.

3
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:07.560
So please guys stop asking

4
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.970
2020 is getting really very complicated for Donald Trump more than

5
00:00:19.971 --> 00:00:23.030
120,000 coronavirus deaths and United States,

6
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.270
tens of millions of unemployed people and continuing street protests against

7
00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:27.830
racism and police brutality.

8
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.130
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

9
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.160
<v 0>And although it may have got lost in all the drama that has been happening</v>

10
00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:42.620
recently, just not forget that just a little while ago,

11
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.300
Trump was facing impeachment. Do you guys remember that?

12
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.400
If he doesn't don't worry.

13
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.730
I honestly didn't either a situation from which he emerged victorious,

14
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.690
but during which he was called all sorts of things and none of them were very

15
00:00:53.691 --> 00:00:54.410
nice.

16
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.860
<v 2>No, it was a flagrant assault on her electoral rights,</v>

17
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.510
our national security and our fundamental values corrupting an election to keep

18
00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:07.040
oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive

19
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.130
violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.

20
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.700
<v 0>Well, you could say a loader, but you couldn't really be any Cleaver.</v>

21
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.910
And as a side note, if you think this accusation is already serious,

22
00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:19.880
the most important thing is to pay attention to who made it,

23
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.260
because my visual politic nerds,

24
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.750
these words were not altered by an opposition leader,

25
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.980
but by a real life GOP Senator, and not just any Senator,

26
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.630
this is Mitt Romney,

27
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.480
one of the most important political figures in the political party,

28
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.160
but supports decisions and legislation made by the Trump administration. So,

29
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.730
and the face of impeachment Romney had to make a difficult decision choose

30
00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:45.050
between being faithful to his own judgment or respecting party discipline

31
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.920
Watch carefully because Mitt Romney is not just any old Senator,

32
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.280
his political career and the Republican party is a very long one.

33
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.820
He was governor of the state of Massachusetts participated in the 2008

34
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.990
presidential primary and was the Republican nominee who faced Obama's reelection

35
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.970
in 2012 since last year.

36
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.480
He's also been a Republican Senator for Utah for a six year term,

37
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.630
a post that he could be in until January 20, 25.

38
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.650
No, my visual politic walks Trump overcame impeachment along with other reasons

39
00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:21.980
because his fellow Republicans voted mostly against testimony that could have

40
00:02:21.981 --> 00:02:24.350
proved key such as that of John Bolton,

41
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.530
national security advisor and the Trump administration itself.

42
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.750
We all remember John Bolton, right? He's got a book out now.

43
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.900
So you'll probably have seen him on literally every TV channel for this reason.

44
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.040
Many analysts believe that the GOP definitively surrendered to Trumpism Matt

45
00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:41.420
day, however Romney's rebel vote left open a small crack and Donald Trump's

46
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:42.200
Republican armor,

47
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.010
a crank that has now been made worse during the recent events of 2020.

48
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.130
My visual politic nerds. One question starts to pop up.

49
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.350
Could there be an alternative to Trump?

50
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.520
Can the Senator for Utah be the spearhead of a new movement called on to defeat

51
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.730
Trumpism you'd best pay attention?

52
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.670
Because the last public appearance of Romney was him taking part in the

53
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:06.700
Washington anti-racism marches on the white tapes.

54
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.890
<v 3>We need a voice against racism.</v>

55
00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:13.860
We need many voices against racism and against brutality.

56
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.440
We need to stand up and say that black lives.

57
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.273
<v 1>Matter.</v>

58
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.040
<v 0>You don't want, if there's one thing,</v>

59
00:03:20.041 --> 00:03:22.920
Romney can bolster boat it's consistency and honesty.

60
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.510
As soon as he took the post of Senator,

61
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.870
before we even knew there was going to be an impeachment against the president

62
00:03:27.871 --> 00:03:31.740
Romney was already predicting how he would manage his loyalty to Donald Trump,

63
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.603
listen up.

64
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.210
<v 4>By and large followed the Republican playbook. So I'll be with him,</v>

65
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.140
the places where I'm not with them from time to time will be matters of conduct

66
00:03:40.141 --> 00:03:44.160
or communication that I think are highly defensive or misogynistic or

67
00:03:44.161 --> 00:03:45.960
anti-immigrant in places like that.

68
00:03:45.961 --> 00:03:49.860
I think it's important for my own personal integrity to stand up and say, no,

69
00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:52.800
I disagree with that Mitt Romney, Republican Senator from Utah.

70
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.880
<v 0>So possibly Romney's chance to be president of the United States is over,</v>

71
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.450
but his influence could still be very important for the future of the Republican

72
00:04:00.451 --> 00:04:02.910
party. That's why you hear on visual politics today.

73
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.440
We're going to review his trajectory,

74
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.890
his clashes with president Trump and his political position. Let's get moving.

75
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.490
<v 1>King Midas.</v>

76
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.870
<v 0>Romney, and Donald Trump have one thing in common. They're both millionaires.</v>

77
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.570
In fact, they're more than millionaires they're multi-millionaires,

78
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.420
but that's about as far as the similarities go. Well,

79
00:04:27.421 --> 00:04:32.010
Trump is a guy prone to show an ostentatious Romney is the exact opposite and a

80
00:04:32.011 --> 00:04:35.220
word scandal is not associated with him at all.

81
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.090
We are talking about discreet person with an exemplary family life on one who is

82
00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:41.130
also heavily influenced by his religion.

83
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.460
Indeed,

84
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.330
this has all been much debated throughout his political career because Romney is

85
00:04:48.331 --> 00:04:51.330
a Mormon and less than 2% of Americans are Mormons.

86
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.470
So many people wondered if religious prejudices would act against him.

87
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.590
Given his political journey is clear that this was not the case.

88
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.100
And that is because of Mormons magic underwear. Not really. Let me explain it.

89
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.370
Romney's father was the governor of Michigan and a member of Richard Nixon's

90
00:05:08.371 --> 00:05:09.060
first government.

91
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.450
It seems clear that belonging to such an influential family was an important

92
00:05:12.451 --> 00:05:15.900
advantage yet. The no Senator for UTA wasted no time.

93
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.050
After graduating from the law and business schools of the prestigious Harvard

94
00:05:19.051 --> 00:05:21.930
university, he began a successful career as a businessman,

95
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.000
after a brief stint at the Boston consulting group,

96
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.480
Romney was seen by a rival consultant, Bain and company there.

97
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.060
He was chosen to lead the launch of Bain capital. Currently,

98
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.140
one of the leading venture capital funds in the entire world as an investor

99
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.090
Romney backed hugely successful firms,

100
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.840
such as staples and office supply chain and the world famous Domino's pizza.

101
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.590
These merits led to Romney eventually being named the CEO of being in company.

102
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.920
All of this allowed him to accumulate a personal fortune of more than

103
00:05:46.921 --> 00:05:51.450
$200 million. But when and who that he started his political career,

104
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.490
this is the question that many of you may be wondering.

105
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.210
So you see in the U S a state where Mormons are the majority,

106
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.960
the States of Utah it's Capitol is salt Lake city.

107
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.460
So in the 1990s,

108
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.330
it became public that salt Lake city authorities had braved a lot of members of

109
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:12.380
the international Olympic committee to host the 2002 winter Olympics

110
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.360
bribery and a major sports and competition. Surely not. However, at the time,

111
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.450
that was a tremendous scandal, a scandal that rocked world sport,

112
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.470
the reputation of the Olympic games and left the organizing committee very badly

113
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:26.030
affected no one. And I mean,

114
00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.810
absolutely no one wanted to sponsor those games and have their name linked to

115
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:34.220
corruption. Utah's prestige such as it is. Was it stake? So the question is,

116
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.210
what did they do next?

117
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.153
<v 2>Then.</v>

118
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.600
<v 0>[Inaudible] disaster.</v>

119
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.200
They named this new King maters who ran Bain and company as the head of the

120
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.310
organizing committee,

121
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.910
salt Lake city authorities did their best to organize those games and Romney

122
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:49.750
managed this.

123
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.130
He eliminated a $379 million deficit and ultimately made salt Lake

124
00:06:54.131 --> 00:06:57.850
2020 a great success praised by the international Olympic committee.

125
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.050
No really that's right. Romney achieved,

126
00:07:02.051 --> 00:07:06.100
close to a real miracle and Olympic games that weren't a financial disaster.

127
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.700
<v 4>People of America, Utah, and salt Lake city.</v>

128
00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:12.310
You have given the world Superbowl games.

129
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.330
You have reassured us that people from all countries can live peacefully

130
00:07:16.331 --> 00:07:17.380
together. Thank you.

131
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:22.060
Jock Broga president of the international Olympic committee during the closing

132
00:07:22.061 --> 00:07:23.860
ceremony, the salt Lake city,

133
00:07:23.861 --> 00:07:28.120
2002 Olympic games surplus from winter Olympics is

134
00:07:28.121 --> 00:07:29.380
$56 million.

135
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.210
<v 0>And so my visual politic Politico funds this success prompted Romney to jump</v>

136
00:07:34.211 --> 00:07:35.500
back into politics.

137
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.800
And I saved jumped back because he had previously chosen to be a Senator,

138
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.490
but he was pitted against the eternal Massachusetts Senator, Ted Kennedy,

139
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.490
none other than JFK's brother and for decades,

140
00:07:45.491 --> 00:07:47.800
one of the great kingpins of the democratic party.

141
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:49.720
So he never really stood a chance

142
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.150
By now things have changed. And you know what,

143
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.370
when he was elected governor of Massachusetts,

144
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.450
he showed that his reputation as a King maters was well deserved.

145
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:04.780
He inherited a budget deficit of $3 billion.

146
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:09.130
And just two years later that had been transformed into a surplus of 700,000.

147
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.850
<v 2>A million dollars is great.</v>

148
00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.980
<v 0>Just achievement though, was this healthcare reform, uh,</v>

149
00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:18.160
reform negotiated with the democratic opposition that dominated the

150
00:08:18.161 --> 00:08:22.060
Massachusetts legislature chamber with this reform Romney put in place a system

151
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:25.000
that forces all citizens to take out private health insurance,

152
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.220
to solve the state's most pressing social problem,

153
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.070
the lack of medical coverage of the uninsured, of course,

154
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.040
people who didn't have enough resources to take care of policy received help

155
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.110
from the state. It's a pretty meaningful model.

156
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.680
Let me think ensures that everyone has medical coverage stimulates competition

157
00:08:38.681 --> 00:08:42.520
between insurers and the economies of scale are greater reducing policy costs

158
00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.850
and improving service on the cost of the States is relatively low.

159
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.820
<v 2>We saved that set of citizens who were making three times federal poverty or</v>

160
00:08:48.821 --> 00:08:52.150
more it's $54,000 a year in our state for a family of four.

161
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.380
You have to buy a policy that you can afford. And, um, uh,

162
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.090
and no more showing up at the hospital,

163
00:08:57.091 --> 00:09:00.420
expecting someone else to pay your way for people earning less than three times,

164
00:09:00.421 --> 00:09:04.440
federal poverty. We, we, the state will subsidize their purchase of a policy.

165
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.380
They choose the policy they want, we subsidize its purchase.

166
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.030
And that way we get everybody insured.

167
00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.560
<v 0>Mean it was quite the rising political star.</v>

168
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.920
So he gave up seeking reelection as governor of Massachusetts and audit to run

169
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.660
in the Republican primaries. [inaudible] However,

170
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.900
he was late and joining the race for bushes successor, but the time he arrived,

171
00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:27.290
it was already clear that John McCain would be the Republican's next choice,

172
00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.430
as I'm sure we all remember Obama walked through that presidential election and

173
00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.130
Romney immediately got to work on a new opportunity.

174
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.570
<v 4>The American ideals of economic freedom and opportunity need to clear an</v>

175
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.160
unapologetic defense.

176
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.920
And I intend to make it because I have lived it Mitt Romney.

177
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.600
<v 0>In 2012, the stage was set. Romney was unrivaled and the Republican primaries,</v>

178
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.610
and more importantly for us election,

179
00:09:49.611 --> 00:09:52.970
but his campaign obtained huge amounts of funding. By the way,

180
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.070
among Romney's business supports, there were a few,

181
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.710
how should I best put this unstable elements?

182
00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.770
<v 4>It is tough. He is smart. He is sharp.</v>

183
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.430
He is not going to allow bad things to continue to happen to this country that

184
00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:08.510
we all love. So governor Romney go out and get him. You can do it.

185
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.010
Donald Trump in 2012,

186
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:13.730
Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue,

187
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.550
no wonder he lost Donald Trump in 2016.

188
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.290
<v 0>By now, I think we're all pretty familiar with Donald Trump and has questionable</v>

189
00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:25.850
relationship with truth and coherence. The thing is Romney lost to Obama.

190
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.900
And as you knew, the GOP then fell into Trump's Taney hands. However,

191
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:30.920
my visual politic nerds,

192
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:34.400
if there was one person who was never a fan of the current tenant of the white

193
00:10:34.401 --> 00:10:36.320
house is Mitt Romney. Check this out.

194
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.290
<v 1>A Republican with principals [inaudible].</v>

195
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.610
<v 0>So to begin with Romney's profile was perfect for reaching the white house.</v>

196
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.590
However, he had one small problem.

197
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.710
He lacked charisma with the American population to be fair to him.

198
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.010
Romney might be someone who'd be better as an actual president and as a

199
00:10:58.011 --> 00:10:58.580
candidate,

200
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.450
something insurmountable when your rival is a guy as media-savvy photogenic and

201
00:11:02.451 --> 00:11:03.800
as popular as Barack Obama.

202
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.470
<v 2>Do you Mr. President on your anniversary,</v>

203
00:11:06.471 --> 00:11:09.200
I'm sure this was the most dramatic place you could imagine. Here.

204
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.730
<v 0>Here with me, in addition,</v>

205
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.240
democratic messaging succeeded in introducing Romney as a top executive,

206
00:11:14.241 --> 00:11:17.150
without any scruples, someone capable of selling his own mother.

207
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.860
As long as it increased company profits.

208
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.540
<v 1>Mitt Romney attacked 47% of Americans who pay no income tax,</v>

209
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.580
including veterans elderly.

210
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.150
The disabled is not to worry about those fields.

211
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.750
Doesn't the president have to worry about everyone. I'm Barack Obama.

212
00:11:32.751 --> 00:11:33.584
And I approve this.

213
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.880
<v 0>What's interesting though,</v>

214
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:38.990
was that something was changing and the soul of the Republican party just take a

215
00:11:38.991 --> 00:11:42.530
loot at Clint Eastwood speech at the 2012 Republican convention.

216
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:47.570
<v 1>It's maybe time for maybe a businessman</v>

217
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:54.763
[inaudible].

218
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:02.790
<v 0>Unfortunately for Republicans and particularly Clint Eastwood is that American's</v>

219
00:12:02.791 --> 00:12:06.390
preference Obama's messaging. And when they did go looking for a businessman,

220
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.040
there was no Romney. There was Donald.

221
00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.580
<v 2>Where are the shirts made Bangladesh? What is good?</v>

222
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.230
We employ people in Bangladesh eyes where the ties beautiful ties.

223
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:19.980
They are great ties. The ties are made in where China eyes are made in China.

224
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.840
<v 0>That Romney never wanted to see Trump in the white house.</v>

225
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.450
This is what he had to say about the current president when they were both

226
00:12:30.451 --> 00:12:33.590
fighting for the Republican nomination four years ago in 2016.

227
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.610
<v 2>Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud.</v>

228
00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.900
His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump university.

229
00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.970
He's playing the members of the American public for suckers.

230
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:48.540
He gets a free ride to the white house and all we get is a lousy hat.

231
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:50.250
<v 0>So now the question we have to ask is,</v>

232
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.790
so does Romney criticize everything Trump does? And the truth is no.

233
00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.840
He himself acknowledges that some of the Trump administration's economic

234
00:13:03.841 --> 00:13:07.050
measures in the United States have worked much better than he expected.

235
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.110
He's also supported most of the president's appointments that he's made in his

236
00:13:10.111 --> 00:13:12.510
administration. And in terms of foreign policy,

237
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.040
he's what some would call a Hawk.

238
00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.460
And that he agrees with the heavy-handed policy towards China and Iran.

239
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:18.270
In other words,

240
00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:22.860
he agrees with what we might describe as Donald Trump's Republican agenda books.

241
00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:26.430
He hates Trump's methods and approaches that are at odds with the typical

242
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.790
Republican agenda. And the impeachment realm was the moment when Romney went,

243
00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:33.300
you know what, this far and no further I've had enough. Yeah,

244
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.460
that was really Scottish. I'm sorry. When I get angry,

245
00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.630
it comes out the president.

246
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:39.540
<v 2>I asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival.</v>

247
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.530
The president withheld vital military funds from that government depressant to

248
00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:44.190
do so.

249
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:48.780
The president delayed funds for an American ally at war with Russian

250
00:13:48.781 --> 00:13:53.730
invaders. President's purpose was personal and political accordingly.

251
00:13:53.731 --> 00:13:58.110
The president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.

252
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.910
<v 0>Only two Republican senators voted with the democratic party to call for more</v>

253
00:14:05.911 --> 00:14:09.180
witnesses, including John Bolton, who had asked to testify, of course,

254
00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:10.860
Romney was one of them, but it didn't matter.

255
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:13.800
The Republican majority laid down the petition and finally,

256
00:14:13.801 --> 00:14:17.610
and the decisive vote Romney was the only Republican Senator to go against

257
00:14:17.611 --> 00:14:21.540
Trump. However, November's elections are getting closer. If Trump is defeated,

258
00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.730
the GOP will have to begin a new phase.

259
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.610
And the question is what could Romney contribute to them?

260
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.660
<v 2>Romney 2024?</v>

261
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.900
<v 0>Um, these volts at impeachment corrects one of his biggest mistakes as a former</v>

262
00:14:42.901 --> 00:14:43.380
candidate,

263
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.560
which is that instead of going to the center of the political space in search of

264
00:14:46.561 --> 00:14:47.100
more votes,

265
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:51.000
he chose and stent to plicate the tea party at the time of the primaries for the

266
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.930
16 elections. I'm sure you all remember the tea party.

267
00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:58.630
<v 1>And you know, up in Alaska, we have a smaller version of tea party up there.</v>

268
00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.320
We call it ice tea.

269
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.580
<v 0>Partying as a GOP movement that I about a decade ago,</v>

270
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.190
had a lot of influence within the organization in general,

271
00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.910
as a movement that considers taxes to be theft that promotes a tough political

272
00:15:09.911 --> 00:15:13.900
agenda and above all is a very nationalist movement, really nationalists.

273
00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:18.340
In fact, in any case in 2012, Romney started from a moderate economic plan.

274
00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:21.640
The gradually changed to bring about huge reforms to give you an idea.

275
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.670
One of the biggest electoral tricks was to put a huge tax cuts in place,

276
00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:27.050
a much larger reduction in Trump mate, check it out.

277
00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.640
Romney's tax reform meant a 20% drop for all taxpayers.

278
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:38.260
The maximum rate drops to 28% while with drum estate at 37%,

279
00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:41.980
I stump has done Romney also pledged to make a huge reduction in taxing

280
00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:43.090
corporate profits.

281
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:47.350
And that is not all Romney also promised a total tax exemption for capital

282
00:15:47.351 --> 00:15:47.771
income,

283
00:15:47.771 --> 00:15:52.390
the produced profits of under $200,000 and to offset all of these tax cuts

284
00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:56.350
Romney pledged to reduce public spending to below 20% of USG.

285
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.100
<v 1>So in other words.</v>

286
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.340
<v 0>Romney pledged to carry out a complete revolution that would have made the</v>

287
00:16:03.341 --> 00:16:06.100
United States. One of the most fiscally attractive countries in India.

288
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:10.030
<v 1>Of course.</v>

289
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.310
<v 0>You know what the election campaigns promise everything.</v>

290
00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:16.420
But unlike Trump Romney as a strong advocate of budget balance,

291
00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:18.250
and I don't know, probably if he were president,

292
00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.880
he wouldn't have been able to carry out this change entirely. But in any case,

293
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.850
the course was clear. Mitt Romney is a true Republican,

294
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:28.000
even though some of his fellow politicians have approached him for things like

295
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:32.950
this, how Mitt Romney's healthcare experts helped design Obamacare.

296
00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:34.750
So, yes, my visual politicals,

297
00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:38.260
you surely know that Obama's health reform has been systematically criticized by

298
00:16:38.261 --> 00:16:40.600
every Republican that has ever existed from the start.

299
00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:42.463
<v 1>Oh.</v>

300
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.380
<v 0>They find it very expensive. And Trump has tried to cancel it several times,</v>

301
00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:49.180
although he has not yet succeeded.

302
00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:52.810
The fact is that the famous Obamacare was inspired by the Massachusetts

303
00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:57.040
reformed. The met Romney implemented when he was governor. The idea makes sense,

304
00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:00.700
forcing everyone to have private health insurance sets two things in motion.

305
00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:05.050
One that with greater demand insurance companies have more room to lower prices

306
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:09.100
and compete with each other on a level playing field and to whoever can't afford

307
00:17:09.101 --> 00:17:12.160
it can be given help so they can pay for the policies.

308
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:15.850
Then there's already the debates on how this health has to be and whether the

309
00:17:15.851 --> 00:17:18.970
state has to take part or not in order to compete. In fact,

310
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.610
perhaps these are the biggest political differences. In any case,

311
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.910
we will talk about the health system in the United States very soon in another

312
00:17:24.911 --> 00:17:27.760
video. And let's be honest probably until the end of time

313
00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:35.530
In terms of foreign policy Romney is a strong advocate of trade with Mexico and

314
00:17:35.531 --> 00:17:36.010
Canada.

315
00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:39.520
So he probably wouldn't have gone with NAFTA and he would not have put tariffs

316
00:17:39.521 --> 00:17:41.530
on a European union, either for Romney.

317
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:45.160
These countries in North America and Europe are strong allies of the United

318
00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:45.190
States.

319
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:48.760
And so the heavy hand and all the protectionist measures must be limited only

320
00:17:48.761 --> 00:17:52.430
to. So finally,

321
00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:53.930
a lot of you may be wondering,

322
00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.170
will Romney really find himself enough support to fight for the leadership of

323
00:17:57.171 --> 00:17:59.570
post-Trump republicanism? Probably not,

324
00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.230
but his collaborators such as Oren Cass have launched an American compass,

325
00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.710
a new movement within the Republican party that aspires to lead the way for the

326
00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:10.460
center, right in the coming years, make a note of names like Marco Rubio,

327
00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.520
or Tom cotton as candidates for the upcoming Republican primaries.

328
00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.130
But now as always, we leave the questions over to you.

329
00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.250
Would you like to see Matt Romney as a candidate for the 2024 presidential

330
00:18:19.251 --> 00:18:21.770
election? Do you think Trump will run again in 2020?

331
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.260
And how do I get some of that magic Mormon underwear?

332
00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:25.640
Leave your answers in the comments below.

333
00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:27.020
And if you find this video interesting,

334
00:18:27.021 --> 00:18:29.480
please give us a Lake and don't forget to scrape it to visual politic.

335
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.640
If you haven't already, there's a little alarm button down there,

336
00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.160
which you can click. If you want to get updates whenever our video is coming.

337
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:34.700
It's also,

338
00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.310
don't forget to check out our friends on the reconsider media podcast,

339
00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:40.400
all of the vocals in this episode that weren't mine were provided by them. Also,

340
00:18:40.401 --> 00:18:42.770
I host a podcast called making Europe grants. Again,

341
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.270
I wonder where I got that slogan from.

342
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:46.190
If you're interested in a more comedic take on the news,

343
00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.160
it's me and a bunch of my comedian friends talking about politics and world

344
00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:51.620
events. You can find it on Spotify, iTunes, SoundCloud,

345
00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.110
or whatever app you use to download your podcasts. Please check it out.

346
00:18:54.111 --> 00:18:55.610
And as always, we hope you enjoyed the video.

347
00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:56.570
<v 5>You next time.</v>

348
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.780
