00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.043
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.300
<v 1>Belarus is a country known for being the last dictatorship in Europe.</v>

3
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.340
And as you might see, here we go again.

4
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.400
The visual politic guys are labeling everything that does not fall into the

5
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.840
interest of capitalism as a dictatorship, but not exactly even Belarus,

6
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.480
his own dictator recognizes what he is. Check.

7
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.200
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

8
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.070
<v 2>It's better to be a dictator than gay declares. Bellaruse president.</v>

9
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.320
<v 1>Putting that internalized homophobia side.</v>

10
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.860
You're probably all thinking what kind of dictatorship can it be if they've just

11
00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:41.270
had elections? Yes. My visual politic Amigos on the 9th of August, 2020,

12
00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:44.690
Belorussians went to the polls as they do every five years.

13
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.080
And for the sixth time Alexander Lukashenko won.

14
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.760
And you're probably wondering what kind of margin he won by. Was it 51%, 60, 70?

15
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.680
Well, no, it was a totally legitimate 80% as you can probably imagine.

16
00:00:57.681 --> 00:01:00.350
This result is dodgier than a $9 bank note.

17
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.290
And the truth is it's neither the first, nor even the second time,

18
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.580
this man has manipulated so many elections that he doesn't even try to hate it.

19
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.973
<v 0>Listen up.</v>

20
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.740
<v 2>We have rigged the latest election. 93.5% have voted for Lucas Shanko,</v>

21
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.960
but they say it is not a European outcome.

22
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.370
So we have made it 86% Alexander Luca Shanko after the elections of

23
00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:23.510
2006.

24
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.810
<v 1>Okay. Believe it or not, your ears are not deceiving.</v>

25
00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:28.880
You look a Shango is more than a dictator.

26
00:01:28.881 --> 00:01:31.670
He is a classic villain in a James Bond movie,

27
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.240
megalomaniac thirsty for power and completely lacking in any scruples

28
00:01:35.241 --> 00:01:35.840
whatsoever.

29
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.930
Remember this image because it will help us to better understand the current

30
00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:42.680
situation and Belarus. Anyway, let's get back to our story.

31
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.790
In August of 2020, Belorussians had elections.

32
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.620
This is already traditional in these places.

33
00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:51.620
The opposition candidates have had to leave the country.

34
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.020
Look at GenCos detractors. As you can imagine,

35
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.020
have taken to the streets and many of them are in jail.

36
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.800
How many people are we talking about here though? Maybe a hundred inmates, 500,

37
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.160
well, no less than 6,700 detainees,

38
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.030
according to the Belorussian authorities themselves and many among those are

39
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.720
minors.

40
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.380
And I don't think anyone's going to be surprised if I tell you that Bellers and

41
00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:15.380
prisons are pretty much the last place that you would want to be.

42
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.560
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

43
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.150
<v 2>Inside to the TSIP dozens of men were told to strip naked and get down on all</v>

44
00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:26.210
fours whilst officers kicked and beat them with truncheons.

45
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.120
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

46
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.200
<v 1>But in some clubs that I go to,</v>

47
00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:35.390
you have to pay pretty good money to get that kind of treatment.

48
00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:38.150
I know what you guys are all thinking. We've seen this before here.

49
00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:42.050
We have a former Soviet Republic where human rights are at best optional.

50
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.680
Suddenly a political event brings hundreds of thousands of people into the

51
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.170
street. The government in response to this suppresses,

52
00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:49.820
these protests with violence,

53
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.930
and the story may sound familiar to some of you because it's the exact same

54
00:02:53.931 --> 00:02:56.420
thing that happened in 2014 and the Ukraine.

55
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.280
Do you remember the you remind on protests and you how that story ended and

56
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:01.810
ended with the sky?

57
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.910
<v 0>That's right.</v>

58
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.990
<v 1>My three-time in a rural Halloween costume of Latin or Putin invaded Crimea to</v>

59
00:03:09.991 --> 00:03:12.420
prevent Ukraine from leaving its area of influence.

60
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.350
So the question we ask ourselves today is can Belarus really be a democracy?

61
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.650
Will Putin his army be sent in to defend Lukashenko as Belarus,

62
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.680
the new Ukraine today. We're going to answer all these questions,

63
00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:25.260
but first as always, let's take a look at some history.

64
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.500
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

65
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.140
<v 3>We cure Corona virus with vodka.</v>

66
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.190
<v 1>No, we've all heard some pretty ridiculous theories about the Corona virus from</v>

67
00:03:35.191 --> 00:03:37.050
conspiracy theories to magic treatments.

68
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.710
Well check out Lukashenko his recipe for fighting COVID 19.

69
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.560
<v 3>Vodka and saunas will cure Corona virus says Bella Roos president,</v>

70
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.630
as he refuses to lock down country.

71
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.450
<v 1>He also said, although many other leaders have said the same thing,</v>

72
00:03:51.451 --> 00:03:53.970
the Corona virus would not affect Belarus.

73
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.140
And he called the pandemic a global psychosis. Yeah, really.

74
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.120
You're not hearing things from the outset.

75
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.130
Lukashenko was very clear that this Corona virus thing was not going to affect

76
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.760
him. He even urged Belorussians to stop wearing masks.

77
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.130
And so while half the world was confining itself,

78
00:04:11.131 --> 00:04:14.850
a home Belarus organized a mass events, such as the main ninth parade.

79
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.260
And what happened next,

80
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.730
pretty much what you would expect almost 70,000 infections in a country of

81
00:04:20.731 --> 00:04:23.100
9 million people, including Lukashenko.

82
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.910
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

83
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.680
<v 1>As you can probably imagine in any country,</v>

84
00:04:28.681 --> 00:04:32.010
these figures would have an impact on the president's popularity. Wouldn't they?

85
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.903
Well, yes,

86
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.980
but also no sociological studies and Belarus are virtually prohibited.

87
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.610
In fact,

88
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.330
organizations that want to conduct political surveys have to be approved by the

89
00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:45.900
government. And often they don't publish the results. This year,

90
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.010
several media outlets tried to do an online political survey and guess what

91
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.960
happened? Two things first,

92
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.320
the survey found that Leschenko received 3% unintended votes,

93
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.600
and then the government banned election polls.

94
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.440
<v 0>Of course.</v>

95
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.050
<v 1>Those pools weren't reliable either. It's hard to believe.</v>

96
00:05:04.051 --> 00:05:08.580
Lukashenko has only 3% support. He still has a lot of support and rural areas,

97
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:09.360
but then again,

98
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.130
it defies credibility that in the midst of a COVID 19 crisis Lukashenko has

99
00:05:14.131 --> 00:05:17.880
received 80% of the vote. Although the regime wants to show it this way,

100
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.570
look a shampoo is not the only option. And the 2020 elections.

101
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.370
He competed for the presidency alongside for other candidates of those four

102
00:05:26.371 --> 00:05:30.330
candidates. Only one managed to reach the polls. We're talking about Svetlana,

103
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.463
T's kind of sky

104
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.740
And with an unpronounceable name showed up and her husband's place because he

105
00:05:40.741 --> 00:05:42.510
was put in jail and may of this year.

106
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.240
And what was his crane being a government critical utuber.

107
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.690
So I guess goodbye to any holidays in Belorussia I may be wanting in the future.

108
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.180
The other candidates were also unable to stand for elections.

109
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.750
And that's why the entire Belorussian opposition has closed ranks around messes

110
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.390
Tesco new sky. Her election proposal is clear a transition to democracy.

111
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:02.750
Basically she wants to rule nine months until new elections are called.

112
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.800
During those nine months,

113
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.130
she has promised that she will release all political prisoners and call for

114
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:09.140
clean and transparent elections.

115
00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.560
Now it doesn't take a genius to figure out that this proposal has not made.

116
00:06:12.561 --> 00:06:14.150
Lukashenko very happy.

117
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.210
What you probably couldn't have guessed are the arguments that he's made to

118
00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:18.830
attack his opponent. To take a look at that.

119
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.620
<v 2>Our constitution is not for a woman and our society is not mature enough to vote</v>

120
00:06:26.621 --> 00:06:30.820
for a woman because in our constitution, the president has strong power. Yes.

121
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.320
<v 1>But as you can see,</v>

122
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.650
elections in Belarus are nothing like those and other democratic countries.

123
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.210
And the same goes for the count.

124
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.770
Lukashenko one 80% of the vote against 10% for the opposition,

125
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.110
as you might be able to piece together by now and this election,

126
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.780
we have seen a complete catalog of electoral fraud.

127
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.810
International observers were banned on the election day itself.

128
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.030
The internet was shut down throughout the country.

129
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.510
And several journalists critical of Lucas GenCos regime were expelled from the

130
00:06:55.511 --> 00:06:56.350
country during the case.

131
00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.023
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

132
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.030
<v 1>After the election Lukashenko opponents,</v>

133
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.860
which are clearly more than 10% of voters took to the streets to protest so

134
00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:13.390
far, this is nothing too surprising. What makes this case so special?

135
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.740
Are the numbers more than 200,000 people have taken to the streets in Minsk?

136
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.540
That's one in 10 inhabitants.

137
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.050
Remember we're talking about a dictatorship where the death penalty still

138
00:07:23.051 --> 00:07:24.220
exists. In fact,

139
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.060
more than 6,700 protestors are already in jail.

140
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.210
Three of them have died at the hands of police. In other words,

141
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.900
going out and protesting in Bellaruse as a very risky venture.

142
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.530
The fact that more than 200,000 people dare to demonstrate,

143
00:07:38.531 --> 00:07:41.110
indicates that there are many more who feel the same way,

144
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.120
but have stayed at home at this point.

145
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.850
You're probably wondering what happened to Lucas GenCos opponent.

146
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:48.790
What happened to that nice lady with the unpronounceable name? Well.

147
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.230
<v 0>This [inaudible] yes.</v>

148
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.930
<v 1>You can see how the leader of the opposition Svetlana [inaudible] sky is sitting</v>

149
00:07:58.931 --> 00:08:01.090
in an office of the central electoral commission.

150
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.060
She's reading from a piece of paper on what you said that the protest should

151
00:08:04.061 --> 00:08:07.930
stop and that the demonstrators have to accept Lukashenko whose victory.

152
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:12.220
And yes, it is exactly what it seems. The taking of a hostage.

153
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:16.060
Remember that disco sky, his husband is still in a Belorussian prison.

154
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.420
His children have received death threats. And in addition to all of that,

155
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:23.170
several members of her team were also detained at the time that this video was

156
00:08:23.171 --> 00:08:26.350
recorded. The same day, the video was posted this announcement.

157
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:27.243
<v 0>Okay.</v>

158
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.630
<v 2>Lana, tick enough. Sky is safe. She is in Lithuania.</v>

159
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:37.840
<v 1>Since then. Tesco's Gaia has stayed in Lithuania,</v>

160
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.170
but she has not abandoned her political aspirations. On the contrary,

161
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.280
she has announced that she is prepared to lead a government in exile. Moreover,

162
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.940
she has established a coordination council for the democratic transition.

163
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.200
Unsurprisingly Lukashenko is not happy about this at all.

164
00:08:53.201 --> 00:08:57.330
So both [inaudible] and her team could be tried for attacking Belarus is

165
00:08:57.331 --> 00:08:58.530
national security.

166
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.700
All of this explains why both the European union like Canada and the United

167
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.380
Kingdom do not recognize the results.

168
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.090
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

169
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.130
<v 1>The elections of the 9th of August,</v>

170
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.730
2020 are considered a fraud by almost every country in the world on which

171
00:09:13.731 --> 00:09:16.880
countries do accept the results. Well, and this list,

172
00:09:16.881 --> 00:09:21.350
we have countries like China Tajikistan and of course, right?

173
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.030
<v 0>So by this point.</v>

174
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:29.600
<v 1>I know what you're thinking. We haven't mentioned Putin for a couple of minutes.</v>

175
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:33.320
Think about it. Russia and Belarus are sister countries. And the 1990s,

176
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.780
they consider joining officially as one country.

177
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.560
Some of the gas and oil arrives from Russia to Europe passes through the

178
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.180
Belorussian pipelines and Putin,

179
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.820
and look at shank who have been great friends for decades.

180
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.690
<v 0>So the real.</v>

181
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.260
<v 1>The question is what is Putin going to do in this case? Well,</v>

182
00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:55.550
he defend Lukashenko well,

183
00:09:55.551 --> 00:09:58.220
he sends the Russian army to men's cause to stop the protests.

184
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.520
The answer to this question is also the answer to an even more important

185
00:10:01.521 --> 00:10:04.550
question. Can Belarus really become a democracy?

186
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:06.290
Let's take a look at not right now.

187
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.930
<v 0>The lesser of two evils.</v>

188
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:16.310
<v 1>A few weeks ago here on this channel that sends early 2020 relations between</v>

189
00:10:16.311 --> 00:10:20.330
Putin and Lucas Shanko have gone from blood brothers to it's complicated.

190
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.380
Russia's great aspirations since the 1990s as to annex Belarus,

191
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:27.170
but remember about Lukashenko as a megalomaniac,

192
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.380
he's not the classic dictator who agrees to be a puppet of anyone else,

193
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.680
much less be a dictator of a country that ceases to exist.

194
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.200
So what has Putin done about it? Well,

195
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.320
Putin has been pressuring Lukashenko and the way that he knows best

196
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.620
Threatening to cut off the country's oil and gas supply,

197
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:48.170
these moves could have worked with a rational leader,

198
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.600
but we are talking about Lukashenko here.

199
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:55.610
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

200
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:59.900
<v 1>And that's when and 2020 Looker Shankill broke ranks and threatened to steal</v>

201
00:10:59.901 --> 00:11:02.960
Russian oil passing through Belarusian pipelines and other words,

202
00:11:02.961 --> 00:11:06.230
interrupt Russia's sale of oil to Europe that goes through pipelines,

203
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:09.440
passing through Belarusian territory. So at any time,

204
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:13.790
Belarus could divert those pipes and keep all that dinosaur juice. But.

205
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:14.930
<v 0>That is not all.</v>

206
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:23.210
<v 1>Look at shampoo has also been meeting with the white house. Again,</v>

207
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.970
we explain this in more detail in a video that I'll leave a link to in the

208
00:11:25.971 --> 00:11:27.890
description, but keep this in mind.

209
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:32.600
The European union has eased many of the sanctions on Belarus since 2016 for the

210
00:11:32.601 --> 00:11:34.820
Kremlin. All this means one thing.

211
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.570
Look as Django is making a deal with the enemy and is untrusted.

212
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:39.763
<v 0>Worthy.</v>

213
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:47.420
<v 1>The first big difference between Belarus and Ukraine and 2014,</v>

214
00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:51.470
that Ukraine was ruled by Viktor Yanukovych, a man loyal to the Kremlin.

215
00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:55.270
He may have been corrupt, but he a rational man, we cannot say the same.

216
00:11:55.271 --> 00:11:57.640
However I to Lukashenko. And for this reason,

217
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:00.310
many political analysts set out this.

218
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.800
<v 2>And Putin wouldn't spell a ruse in Moscow's orbit with all without Lukashenko.</v>

219
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:14.550
<v 1>You mentioned before Russia has recognized the totally legitimate election</v>

220
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.510
results and fact Putin called Lukashenko on the election night to congratulate

221
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:22.170
him, but the declarations and here at the time of making this video,

222
00:12:22.171 --> 00:12:25.410
the criminal has not said a word about sending his army to help suppress the

223
00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:29.460
protests and believe me right now Lukashenko needs help.

224
00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.890
And despite all his talk, he doesn't have it.

225
00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:38.040
<v 2>Shane co says, Putin has promised security assistance for better reus.</v>

226
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:42.060
<v 1>And the uncomfortable truth as that Looker Shanko needs that support more than</v>

227
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.190
ever to give you an idea. In 2020,

228
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:48.420
both the Belarusian army and police are still using weapons from the Soviet

229
00:12:48.421 --> 00:12:51.750
union for years, this country has talked about overhauling their army,

230
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.320
but they felt too comfortable having Rutgers help. However, at this point,

231
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.710
Putin's unconditional support is no longer guaranteed.

232
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.630
And I know what a lot of you are going to be thinking.

233
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:03.840
Is Russia going to allow Belarus to have an anti Russian government?

234
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.270
Of course not. But here comes my question.

235
00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:10.410
Who said that the opposition to Luca Shanko has something against Moscow.

236
00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.210
How's your head exploded yet? Well, if not.

237
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.320
<v 0>Watch this [inaudible].</v>

238
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.910
<v 2>But a Russian opposition says it advocates friendly relations with Russia or</v>

239
00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:24.630
other countries.

240
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.530
<v 1>So to give you an idea, one of these four opposition candidates was Mr. Victor,</v>

241
00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:32.190
Baba Kyra, our manager of Gazprom and Belarus. More specifically,

242
00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.460
this man was the director of Gazprom's bank in Belarus.

243
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.120
And in case you don't know Gazprom is the Russian gas industry fully connected

244
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:40.253
to.

245
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.380
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

246
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.450
<v 1>In other words, Putin has two alternatives.</v>

247
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:49.170
One is to send his army to defend a dictator who has betrayed his trust.

248
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.680
And the other is to sit and wait if Looker Shankill wins,

249
00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.400
the situation goes on as it is. If the democratic opposition wins,

250
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.880
everything points to more favorable relations with Russia. And at this point,

251
00:13:59.881 --> 00:14:02.850
some of you will be saying, all right, grant, that is impossible.

252
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:06.780
Putin will not allow an allied country to become a democracy.

253
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.240
And the truth is you're actually wrong. You may be surprised,

254
00:14:09.241 --> 00:14:12.540
but this is not the first time a democratic leader has supported Putin.

255
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:14.100
We've seen it before in Armenia.

256
00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.193
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

257
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:20.760
<v 1>The 2018 revolution brought a democratic transition in that country.</v>

258
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:24.000
Both the current president and the current Armenian prime minister have changed

259
00:14:24.001 --> 00:14:26.430
the regime from top to bottom. What's more,

260
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.890
they're even proposing to change the country's constitution.

261
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.110
And this case Putin avoided intervening.

262
00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.540
He could have sent the army to maintain the Armenian regime.

263
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.710
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

264
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:42.180
<v 1>He decided to stand by today. Armenia is going through a democratic transition,</v>

265
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:46.560
but it remains an ally of Russia and relations with Putin are as good as they

266
00:14:46.561 --> 00:14:47.850
were before the revolution.

267
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.000
Something similar could happen in a hypothetical Belarusian transition.

268
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.830
Moreover,

269
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.920
there's the idea that Russia could have more influence and a free election than

270
00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:58.770
in a dictatorship. Think about it.

271
00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:02.510
And a country like Belarus. The means of communication are very limited.

272
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.081
After all,

273
00:15:03.081 --> 00:15:06.140
we are talking about a country with less than 10 million inhabitants that has

274
00:15:06.141 --> 00:15:10.310
been mired and dictatorship without freedom of expression for 24 years,

275
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:14.090
the Kremlin has had an immense propaganda machine from Russia today to internet

276
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.140
box well used that machinery could serve to propel a pro Russian candidate

277
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.780
straight into the driving seat. In other words,

278
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.840
Putin might be interested in getting Lucas GENCO out of the way.

279
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:28.010
And all of this explains why. Unlike what happened in Ukraine in 2014,

280
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.740
Putin is currently seeing these things about.

281
00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:39.100
<v 4>Putin tells Merkel foreign interference in Belarus. His affairs is unacceptable.</v>

282
00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:42.400
<v 1>And the irony of that statement coming from no less than Vladimir Putin should</v>

283
00:15:42.401 --> 00:15:43.780
not be lost on anyone.

284
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.170
However days after the conversation with miracle on the 27th of August,

285
00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.530
who did announced on Russian television, that he had special forces commander,

286
00:15:50.531 --> 00:15:53.200
ready to act. If the situation gets out of control,

287
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:56.770
we still do not know if he's just seeing this or Russia really will be willing

288
00:15:56.771 --> 00:15:57.604
to take action.

289
00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:01.540
What we can say is that Lukashenko has already proven himself the loser and the

290
00:16:01.541 --> 00:16:05.440
shoe of defiance against Putin, but now we leave the questions over to you.

291
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.470
Do you think that the Belarusian opposition will succeed in overthrowing

292
00:16:08.471 --> 00:16:11.470
Lukashenko could this be the beginning of democracy in Belarus?

293
00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.630
Will I ever be able to go there on holiday?

294
00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.460
You can leave me your answers in the comments.
