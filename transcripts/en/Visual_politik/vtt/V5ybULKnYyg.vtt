00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.590
<v 1>Friends of visual politic, the world has changed. Uh, no,</v>

2
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.880
I'm not referring to the criminal.

3
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:14.743
<v 0>Virus.</v>

4
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.951
<v 1>In this video.</v>

5
00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:22.160
We will talk about the revolution that the energy sector has experienced over

6
00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:27.020
the past decade. More specifically, the dramatic boom in liquified, natural gas,

7
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.100
L N G,

8
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.300
and also how the fracking revolution has changed the balance of power that is

9
00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:35.030
always behind the trade and energy resources.

10
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.270
<v 2>In the past pundits and politicians claimed that America was running out of oil</v>

11
00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:45.050
and natural gas. There were saying it 10 years ago, five years ago,

12
00:00:45.051 --> 00:00:46.640
I was hearing it all the time.

13
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.660
They said the United States would never again be an energy powerhouse.

14
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.310
They said that Americans would have to learn to get by with

15
00:00:55.311 --> 00:00:58.730
much, much, much less, but you prove them wrong.

16
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.130
<v 1>King has caused the United States to boost its natural gas production.</v>

17
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.320
To the extent that since 2017,

18
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.920
the land of uncle Sam has been fully self-sufficient in terms of providing for

19
00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:11.330
its own energy consumption.

20
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.650
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.350
<v 1>But even have enough to be in a position to export it, of course,</v>

22
00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:24.470
because of its geographical location. The question as to who,

23
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.070
because the United States only has two neighbors to the North Canada,

24
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.200
a country that is also self-sufficient and guests.

25
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.650
And that in fact has exported large quantities of gas to the West coast of the

26
00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:37.490
United States for decades. And then to the South there's Mexico,

27
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.740
which already receives more than half of all the gas.

28
00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:42.830
It consumes by a gas pipeline from the United States.

29
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.900
So where can they flog the surplus?

30
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.570
Because the truth is the United States still has a lot.

31
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.280
And I mean a lot of gas leftover and that's precisely why an audit to look at

32
00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:53.510
markets and other continents.

33
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.600
You definitely need to consider LNG liquified natural.

34
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.493
<v 0>Yes.</v>

35
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.990
<v 1>We'll know, natural gas is traditionally exported through pipelines,</v>

36
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.140
but there is one major obstacle to this way of transporting gas.

37
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.630
The oceans underwater pipelines exist,

38
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.140
but establishing an underwater pipeline for thousands and thousands of males and

39
00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:15.800
a great depth is a terribly expensive and technically very complicated

40
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.340
undertaking.

41
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.250
So in order to be able to carry a trade between far-flung countries,

42
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.520
the only real alternative that exists is precisely liquified.

43
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.983
<v 0>Yes.</v>

44
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.620
<v 1>In a way, similar to this technology,</v>

45
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.490
this way of transporting energy has a huge advantage over pipelines as simply

46
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.550
manages to reach markets that are impossible to reach with a pipeline.

47
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.250
And the case of the United States makes this very clear.

48
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.330
It is the best example of how global gas markets have changed over the past

49
00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:42.164
decade.

50
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.390
I don't think this is an isolated case.

51
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.380
Even countries with long traditions as gas exporters' are also targeting this

52
00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:52.160
new method.

53
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.450
<v 0>Okay. Russia,</v>

54
00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:58.280
gas strategy prioritize liquid natural gas with a more modest role for gas

55
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.040
prom. So the States and.

56
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.020
<v 1>Russia, but also Australia, Qatar, Nigeria, the world is pushing hard for LNG.</v>

57
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.900
Check out this chart about new liquification capability.

58
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.740
The blue that represents the world stands out more in recent years than the red

59
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.240
representing the United States.

60
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.243
<v 0>Check it out.</v>

61
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.120
<v 1>Of course, if we're talking about gas,</v>

62
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.330
we're talking about money to look at what fatty Bureau director of the

63
00:03:24.331 --> 00:03:26.010
international energy agency says.

64
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.390
<v 0>LNG investments hit record of 50 billion in 2019.</v>

65
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.333
Do you see that.

66
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.010
<v 1>It's $50 billion in a single year?</v>

67
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.210
The global LNG market is moving more bank notes around the world's capitals than

68
00:03:39.211 --> 00:03:40.044
money heist.

69
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.530
So the question we can ask ourselves is why is there this growing interest for

70
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.870
liquified natural gas and the global energy market?

71
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.620
What changes could it cause any international relations of the major powers?

72
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.970
Well, today on visual politics,

73
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.720
we are going to play teacher and answer these questions. But first as always,

74
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.410
let's take a look at.

75
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.243
<v 0>History.</v>

76
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.223
Denver.

77
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.790
<v 1>Analogy to liquefy natural gas was not developed until the 1960s,</v>

78
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.510
but the revolution the LNG has brought to market has really come along and been

79
00:04:12.511 --> 00:04:14.970
developed in the last decade. In 10 years,

80
00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:18.540
the volume of liquified natural gas marketed worldwide has doubled and

81
00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:21.750
accelerated trends since 2016 when Australia Russia,

82
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.890
and especially the United States have literally flooded the global energy market

83
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.190
with liquified natural gas. And as we told you in previous videos,

84
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.700
fracking has caused the United States to increase its natural gas production by

85
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.340
80%, since 2005, that is,

86
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.210
it produces today almost twice as much gas as it dead just 15 years ago.

87
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.450
Something that explains why the United States has not only managed to supply its

88
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.380
own demands since 2017, but why it has enough to consider exploring.

89
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.453
<v 0>Okay.</v>

90
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.551
<v 1>Friends,</v>

91
00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:53.580
this revolution has been such that it is completely changed the business

92
00:04:53.581 --> 00:04:57.660
strategies of energy companies in the United States infrastructure that had been

93
00:04:57.661 --> 00:04:59.760
designed to import to huge amounts of gas,

94
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.990
had to receive investments of more than $100 billion to be transformed and to

95
00:05:03.991 --> 00:05:08.460
export facilities almost overnight. The goal became to liquified natural gas.

96
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.211
That is cool.

97
00:05:09.211 --> 00:05:13.530
It to minus 162 degrees Celsius to convert it into a liquid state so that it

98
00:05:13.531 --> 00:05:15.390
could be exported by huge methane.

99
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.553
<v 0>Oh ships.</v>

100
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.940
<v 1>Of course, when you have merchandise ready for sale,</v>

101
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.890
there was only one thing missing the buyer.

102
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.040
So who do you think has been the aggressive salesman responsible for placing the

103
00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:28.500
U S L N G on the market? Well,

104
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.260
none other than president Donald Trump.

105
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.630
<v 0>We all know him.</v>

106
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.170
<v 1>His tactics first, he threatens to impose tariffs, both left and right.</v>

107
00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.480
And then the negotiations begin in 2018.

108
00:05:42.481 --> 00:05:45.450
He threatened to start a transatlantic trade war with the European union.

109
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.313
And what did he get?

110
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.110
We'll look at what the then president of the European commission, Jean-Claude,

111
00:05:49.111 --> 00:05:51.570
Juncker promised an exchange for the United States,

112
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.850
not inputting tires on European cars.

113
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.250
<v 0>That was my main intention to, to come.</v>

114
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.580
<v 3>Down to zero tariffs on industrial goods.</v>

115
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.270
We've decided to strengthen our cooperation on energy.

116
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.190
You will build more terminals to import liquified natural gas from the

117
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.623
us.

118
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.450
<v 1>And as we usually see on this channel, no sooner said than done us.</v>

119
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.800
Guests went from representing a meager 5% of all liquified natural gas imported

120
00:06:20.801 --> 00:06:25.780
in Tuesdays and 18 to reaching a 15% share a year later in 2019 statistics

121
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:26.643
don't lie.

122
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.560
And those were more or less the figures when the Corona virus arrived,

123
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.050
all of this came together in 2020. On one hand,

124
00:06:38.051 --> 00:06:40.030
we found that Europe had had its gas warehouses,

125
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.230
an occupancy level of sexy percent compared to 40%. That was the usual level.

126
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.720
Add to that.

127
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.010
The productive land that all economies have suffered because of COVID-19.

128
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.460
And what do we find? Well, a market that is hard to say enough,

129
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.550
I don't need any more liquified natural gas for night.

130
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.970
And this is a problem as a problem because you know that president Trump treats

131
00:06:57.971 --> 00:07:01.990
his allies according to his business interests, what do you want to buy from me?

132
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.590
Oh, you're my best friend. What? You're not buying anything. You'll be sorry.

133
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:06.453
And the truth is,

134
00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.300
I don't think he likes to see how Europe is canceling orders for us LNG,

135
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.870
even if it's simply because Europe's demand, doesn't warrant more gas right now.

136
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.610
Well, it turns out that even in the worst moments of the coronavirus crisis,

137
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.330
there was a backlog of missing cargo ships and European waters looking

138
00:07:25.331 --> 00:07:27.580
desperately for a gas holder to unload that.

139
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:33.100
<v 4>G tankers buildup around virus hit Europe as crisis of Bates in Asia.</v>

140
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.520
<v 1>In any case, despite good sales data to Europe in 2019,</v>

141
00:07:36.521 --> 00:07:38.380
we must not lose sight of the fact that the country,

142
00:07:38.381 --> 00:07:42.820
to which the United States exports the most LNG is none other than South Korea.

143
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.500
We're talking about the country.

144
00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:51.010
That is the third most dependent on this fuel on the entire planet.

145
00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.150
Its appetite for guests just keeps growing and not surely something Trump will

146
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.000
link because my friends, the truth is that in the coming years,

147
00:07:58.001 --> 00:08:01.510
the United States will compete face to face with great exports in powers like

148
00:08:01.511 --> 00:08:04.720
Qatar and Australia. For example, U S market share and sales,

149
00:08:04.721 --> 00:08:08.050
Korea will double after this agreement is signed with BP.

150
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:10.541
<v 4>Long-term contract.</v>

151
00:08:10.541 --> 00:08:15.130
The inputs are expected to surge to 7.9 million tons by 2025 with an

152
00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:17.500
increased portion of 22.8%.

153
00:08:17.501 --> 00:08:20.770
We expect to see the expansion of energy trade between the two countries,

154
00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:25.000
the diversification of the natural gas adoption and the stability of natural gas

155
00:08:25.001 --> 00:08:27.100
supply industry, ministry of South Korea.

156
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.780
<v 1>And my friends. What happens in November and November, 2020 elections,</v>

157
00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:35.920
there are elections in the United States and no one dare say who will eventually

158
00:08:35.921 --> 00:08:37.300
sit in the oval office.

159
00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:41.620
What is certain though? And I mean,

160
00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:44.320
a sure thing is that once we have overcome the bump,

161
00:08:44.321 --> 00:08:46.480
we are currently experiencing with the Corona virus,

162
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:50.890
the U S liquified natural gas will continue its export boom around the world.

163
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.690
We're assured of this. As we are of Trump,

164
00:08:52.691 --> 00:08:57.480
continuing to use gas imports and his way of doing politics for as long as he

165
00:08:57.481 --> 00:08:58.890
stays in the white house.

166
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.600
<v 4>Big news, as I promised two weeks ago,</v>

167
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:07.190
the first shipment of LNG has just left the Cameron LNG export facility in

168
00:09:07.191 --> 00:09:11.870
Louisiana, not only have thousands of jobs been created in the USA,

169
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.790
we are shipping freedom and opportunity abroad, Donald Trump, freedom.

170
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.440
<v 1>And opportunities beyond its borders. One is Trump talking about, well,</v>

171
00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:24.920
actually the truth is that it's just a meaningful statement because if there was

172
00:09:24.921 --> 00:09:26.270
any hostage in this episode,

173
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.810
it is Europe which has been held to ransom by Russian gas for decades.

174
00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.190
So the question is, well,

175
00:09:31.191 --> 00:09:35.450
Vladimir Putin let the U S liquified natural gas calmly reached the shores of

176
00:09:35.451 --> 00:09:38.720
the old continent. In the beginning, we told you that he had a strategy.

177
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.320
So where are the battles fought in Europe? Well, same places. They always are.

178
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:43.613
<v 0>Listen up.</v>

179
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.390
<v 4>Berlin, always Berlin.</v>

180
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.300
<v 1>You block of countries is the third largest consumer of natural gas after the</v>

181
00:09:56.301 --> 00:09:59.660
United States and Russia, of course, unlike in these two countries,

182
00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:03.740
gas reduction within the European community has been in decline for years today,

183
00:10:03.741 --> 00:10:06.830
it barely meets 15% of Europe's total consumption.

184
00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:10.760
So obviously that means we have to bring in guests from outside countries,

185
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.590
however, all the 27 partners,

186
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:17.330
it is Germany that has the biggest demand by far I accounts for around 24% of

187
00:10:17.331 --> 00:10:20.780
all European gas imports. How does Germany do this? Well,

188
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:25.610
basically 100% arrives by pipeline and 0% pare methane vessel.

189
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:26.241
And of course,

190
00:10:26.241 --> 00:10:28.940
when you know that half the gas that has Germany comes from Russia,

191
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.640
and you're not so surprised that when Putin invades, Crimea,

192
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.110
no one in Berlin lifts.

193
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.273
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

194
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:41.420
<v 1>And the worst is that this dependence on Russian gas will only increase more and</v>

195
00:10:41.421 --> 00:10:45.560
more. As Germany has voted to dispense with nuclear power from 2023 onwards.

196
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.340
So Germany needs to diversify its energy sources at all costs.

197
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.700
If he does not want to be subjected almost entirely to Moscow's wishes.

198
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.570
And the warnings to Berlin have not stopped ringing. Look at this latest one.

199
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.490
<v 4>He needs more LNG to compliment renewables. IEA sets.</v>

200
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.440
<v 1>Between union reached a record level of liquified natural gas imports in 2019.</v>

201
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:10.400
That is why it is very striking that Germany Europe's largest consumer of gas

202
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.970
has not yet opted for this type of energy and something that is even more

203
00:11:13.971 --> 00:11:16.520
striking while it has a couple of projects underway.

204
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.060
Its main energy plan is centered on a new pipeline with Russia,

205
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.460
the Nord stream two and my friends,

206
00:11:22.461 --> 00:11:26.420
both the United States and those who rule in Brussels have strongly opposed this

207
00:11:26.421 --> 00:11:27.350
project. Why?

208
00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.920
Because they don't want to increase Europe's energy dependence on the Kremlin

209
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.540
before we move on here is another,

210
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.520
You can see until the Corona virus arrived,

211
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.360
we had an expanding market and Europe and yes, as this guy, blue bar shoes,

212
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:48.110
American liquified natural gas had burst onto the scene dramatically.

213
00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:50.540
But as you can see in the purple segment,

214
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:55.420
Russia is unwilling to easily seed its share Novatek is the Russian company that

215
00:11:55.421 --> 00:11:57.160
is betting the most on this technology.

216
00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.740
So Putin has realized the competition to other countries,

217
00:11:59.741 --> 00:12:03.630
liquified natural gas brings to the gas prom pipelines and has already launched

218
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:04.660
its new strategy.

219
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.350
If the Europeans want liquified natural guests they'll have like a fight natural

220
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.020
gas, but it will also be Russian.

221
00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.473
<v 0>Right?</v>

222
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:20.700
<v 1>And the truth is that Russian gas has a huge advantage over us gas it's price</v>

223
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:21.000
time,

224
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.480
because one of the main elements influencing the price of liquified natural gas

225
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.820
is precisely transport costs.

226
00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:30.360
Basically the shorter distance to be covered by methane vessels, the lore,

227
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.020
the bill. And let's not forget that European economies need to be competitive.

228
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:37.470
And the endless respect to the cost of energy remains one of the main factors to

229
00:12:37.471 --> 00:12:41.960
be taken into account. Well,

230
00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:43.830
as you can see, it's going to be very,

231
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:47.490
very difficult for the European union to give up Russian guests even more.

232
00:12:47.491 --> 00:12:49.710
So if we consider news like this.

233
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:55.350
<v 0>Flux CS, Nova tech to build German LNG terminal by 2022 in case you're one.</v>

234
00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:59.970
<v 1>During yes, this news means that Germany will receive even more Russian gas,</v>

235
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.690
but what will happen to the Germans if they increased the dependence on Russian

236
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.500
gas, but let's just wait one moment because Russian liquified natural gas,

237
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.920
doesn't just look to the West. Rich to the East are also viable,

238
00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:14.520
melting in the Arctic and icebreakers have made navigation to the Pacific ocean

239
00:13:14.521 --> 00:13:16.560
possible for more and more days a year.

240
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:20.400
It's one of those catch 22 situations where burning gas allows you to sell more

241
00:13:20.401 --> 00:13:22.470
gas at the expense of the planet.

242
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.620
But once their Russian gas has access to the continent that has the largest

243
00:13:25.621 --> 00:13:27.720
appetite for natural gas, more importantly,

244
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:31.230
where more bank notes are spent on this energy source. Take a look at this.

245
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:37.913
<v 0>Tokyo.</v>

246
00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.420
<v 1>We're talking about liquified natural gas. We're basically talking about Asia.</v>

247
00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.650
This continent is the destination of almost 70% of all liquified gas traded

248
00:13:49.651 --> 00:13:50.370
worldwide.

249
00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:55.020
And Japan has been the largest importer on the planet by far for decades.

250
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:56.130
Just so you get an idea.

251
00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:00.270
Japan alone imports more liquified natural gas than the entire European union

252
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.020
demand accelerated very strongly after the 2011 tsunami that caused the

253
00:14:04.021 --> 00:14:07.320
Fukushima disaster and the consequent nuclear blockades. Of course,

254
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:09.720
things have changed a little bit since 2014.

255
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:13.020
Gas consumption in Japan has not only not grown since then,

256
00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:17.010
but it's actually fallen by 13%. So why has demand dropped?

257
00:14:17.011 --> 00:14:20.700
Because several nuclear power plants are back on lane and because Japan faces

258
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.320
too closely related problems,

259
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:26.100
the stagnation of its economy and the unstoppable aging of its population.

260
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.700
In any case, although Japanese entrance in liquified natural gas has shrunk.

261
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:33.090
The methane tankers have continued to sail full throttle through the Pacific.

262
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.570
I'm sure that by taking a look at this chart, you'll understand perfectly why

263
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:40.260
In this chart,

264
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.920
you can see the effects of supply and demand and all its splendor higher places

265
00:14:43.921 --> 00:14:47.280
for Asia represented by the yellow and orange lanes, high demand,

266
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:49.890
limited production and reduced supply. As you can see,

267
00:14:49.891 --> 00:14:53.300
there's a lot of difference between Asian lanes and the red ones representing

268
00:14:53.301 --> 00:14:56.840
the Henry hub index, which marks the price of gas in the United States.

269
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.810
Since the fracking revolution, the red lane has stopped descending.

270
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.480
<v 0>In other.</v>

271
00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.070
<v 1>Words, selling gas in Asia is much more lucrative than selling gas in the United</v>

272
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:11.240
States. But as we've said, Japanese demand has been in declaimed since 2004.

273
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.860
However, and the same time period,

274
00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:17.480
liquified natural gas is international trades has grown by 45% and imports

275
00:15:17.481 --> 00:15:19.760
from Asia have grown by 36%.

276
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.880
So the question is which country is pushing Asian demand. Well,

277
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.360
it'll come as a surprise to none of you that it's probably the country that

278
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:26.450
you're all thinking about.

279
00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.270
Look at what energy consultants from wood Mackenzie have forecast.

280
00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:34.450
<v 4>China to surpass Japan as leading LNG importer by 2022.</v>

281
00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:37.720
<v 1>Truth is that this forecast could be brought forward and become a reality</v>

282
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:41.320
earlier this year, due to the economic consequences of the Corona virus.

283
00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:46.360
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

284
00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:46.510
<v 1>Case.</v>

285
00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.840
But there is no doubt about is that the Asian giants awakening has caused China

286
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:53.590
to become an enormous natural gas consumer in 10 years as tripled as

287
00:15:53.591 --> 00:15:56.170
consumption. And if we're talking only about liquified guests,

288
00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.040
then its imports have multiplied tenfold. By the way, take a note here.

289
00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:02.530
Australia has been doing great business with all of this,

290
00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:06.640
a country that supplies roughly half of all the liquified natural gas that Shana

291
00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:09.520
imports, but let's not get distracted by friends.

292
00:16:09.521 --> 00:16:13.750
The most interesting thing is that Chinese imports have not yet peaked.

293
00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.640
And the five years prior to the coronavirus,

294
00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:19.240
they had been growing at 30% per year until the impact of the pandemic set.

295
00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.840
And so with these numbers is clear China as the key market that will be

296
00:16:22.841 --> 00:16:26.200
demanding liquified natural gas the most during the coming years.

297
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.560
This should give us something to think about. Maybe just,

298
00:16:32.561 --> 00:16:36.730
maybe there's someone out there who should put their ideas about trade Wars

299
00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.840
behind them. If they want to avoid a 25% tariff on their gas.

300
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.920
Look for example,

301
00:16:41.921 --> 00:16:45.760
at what happened when Beijing granted tariff exemptions to several Chinese

302
00:16:45.761 --> 00:16:46.594
importers.

303
00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:51.790
<v 4>April 7th, 2020, us restarts LNG exports to China after one year.</v>

304
00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:52.781
<v 1>Friends,</v>

305
00:16:52.781 --> 00:16:56.680
the so-called phase one trade agreement locked China into a commitment to buy us

306
00:16:56.681 --> 00:17:00.340
energy products. What's more than $50 billion. However,

307
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:03.490
it still maintains tariffs on us liquified natural gas,

308
00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.070
which makes Chinese imports dependent on exemptions.

309
00:17:06.071 --> 00:17:08.260
Like the one we have just pointed out. In other words,

310
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:11.710
if Trump wants the United States to become that great liquid natural gas export

311
00:17:11.711 --> 00:17:12.251
energy power,

312
00:17:12.251 --> 00:17:15.700
he dreams of he knows full well that his companies can't miss out on the world's

313
00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:16.534
largest market,

314
00:17:16.570 --> 00:17:20.020
will Trump be willing to backtrack and the trade war that is where we will leave

315
00:17:20.021 --> 00:17:22.960
it. So we really hope you enjoyed this video. Please hit like if you did,
