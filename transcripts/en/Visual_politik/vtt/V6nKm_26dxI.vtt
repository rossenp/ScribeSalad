00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.900
<v 0>This video is brought to you by news voice. The news is.</v>

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.880
<v 1>Almost all us media is owned by just a handful of big corporations.</v>

3
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:09.830
Fake news is obviously a huge problem as well.

4
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.050
And finding something in bias can be really hard.

5
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.300
News voices revolutionizing the news landscape.

as well as international and independent media giving some much needed balance.

9
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.690
Each new story shows multiple sources,

10
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.330
which are all tagged with their bias and perspective.

11
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.600
The news affects almost everything in our lives. What we hear and read, shakes,

12
00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:32.720
which persons we trust, what we eat, what we buy, how we vote,

13
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.170

20
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.093
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

21
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.720
<v 1>There are places who size doesn't do them. Justice take Singapore. For example,</v>

22
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.220
despite being relatively small,

23
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.450
it is a gigantic economic hub at a regional and even global level,

24
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.680
a huge center of economic activity that not only attracts capital and business,

25
00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:27.470
but also a lot of workers, most of whom come from a lazier.

26
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.660
And it is precisely in the latter country,

27
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.180
Malaysia where right next to the border of Singapore,

28
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.030
a fierce project was launched in 2006.

29
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.920
The construction from scratch of an entire city plans to have at least 700,000

30
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:44.870
inhabitants and located on four artificial islands that is on land reclaimed

31
00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:47.300
from the sea. We are talking about forest city,

32
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.020
one of the most ambitious and surprising projects to be found right now,

33
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.860
anywhere in the world. However, if you are faithful followers of visual politic,

34
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.520
you will know that building new cities as if they were Lego projects is nothing

35
00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:01.760
unusual. What's more, it actually makes a lot of sense.

36
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.790
After all our world is becoming more and more urban,

37
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.880
we live more and more on a planet of cities and the numbers don't.

38
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.893
<v 0>Lie.</v>

39
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.070
<v 1>About 56% of the world's population now live in urban areas,</v>

40
00:02:16.071 --> 00:02:19.160
but that's nothing compared to what's to come by 2050.

41
00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:23.420
This percentage is expected to increase to almost 70%. And as you can imagine,

42
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.430
this trend presents a huge challenge.

43
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.000
The cities that already exist have their limits in terms of resources,

44
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.330
space services, or infrastructure capacity. In other words,

45
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.880
they cannot keep expanding without limits.

46
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.420
And that is why in many parts of the world where urbanization is happening

47
00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:40.610
faster than in Europe and North America,

48
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.050
the solution is to build new cities completely from scratch new municipalities

49
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.220
calls to operate more efficiently and achieve better economic performance.

50
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.100
And this is precisely what the forest city project. Yeah.

51
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.143
<v 0>Wait a moment.</v>

52
00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.310
<v 1>Because the case of this macro project is a little bit it's location has been</v>

53
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:03.400
chosen exclusively because of the existence of Singapore.

54
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.960
That is as if it were a whole Malaysia expansion of the city state

55
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.280
friends. In this video,

56
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.520
we are going to tell you all the details about forest city, a project,

57
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:17.350
as unusual as it is controversial in which surprise, surprise China. Yes,

58
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.420
China has it stamped all over it.

59
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.750
Would you like to travel with us to this corner of the world and get to know not

60
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:23.740
only the wonders,

61
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.300
but also the most controversial side of this new city and these types of macro

62
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:30.580
projects in general? Well, let's get started.

63
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.900
<v 0>Singapore.</v>

64
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.850
<v 1>Or dormitory or a Chinese colony. Look at this image for a moment.</v>

65
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.480
Practically all the continental territory North of forest city is empty.

66
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.450
And I'm sure there are many of you who are asking yourselves right now.

67
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.620
Why spend a fortune creating artificial islands and reclaiming land from the sea

68
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.480
instead of building the project on the mainland on existing territory in Johor

69
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.590
state? Well, because the idea is this, you see to create the dream city,

70
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.300
a new model of urban development,

71
00:04:09.301 --> 00:04:12.930
that is a shining example to the whole world and draws the attention of

72
00:04:12.931 --> 00:04:16.860
investors. There cannot be any possible obstacle, no problems with the property,

73
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.190
no problems with urban planning, regulations, et cetera, et cetera.

74
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.530
So new city well use new land, even if it's not strictly necessary.

75
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.100
It's as simple as that. Anyway, even this is not something new,

76
00:04:29.101 --> 00:04:31.890
either the Palm Jumeirah in Dubai, for example,

77
00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.640
is a similar concept on a much smaller scale though. But having said that,

78
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.130
let's get to know this forest DC project a little bit.

79
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.233
<v 0>Better.</v>

80
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.180
<v 1>And take notes because we are talking about 14 square kilometers of new city on</v>

81
00:04:45.181 --> 00:04:48.840
four islands, 300,000 houses, 700,000 inhabitants,

82
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.130
200,000 new jobs, and at least $100 billion of investment.

83
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.450
All of this on a 30 year deadline, these are heart attack inducing figures.

84
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.410
The idea on paper is to use the special economic zone to replicate the success

85
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.831
options.

86
00:05:01.831 --> 00:05:05.460
Then Shenzen is a Chinese city that we have talked about several times on visual

87
00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:05.940
politic.

88
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.360
It's located just across the border from Hong Kong and thanks to its status as a

89
00:05:09.361 --> 00:05:12.480
special economic zone and the influence of nearby Hong Kong.

90
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.050
It went from being a small fishing village to becoming the main technological

91
00:05:16.051 --> 00:05:16.890
hub of China.

92
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.700
And not only that Shenzhen is also one of the top Chinese cities with the

93
00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:23.220
highest incomes and highest quality of life. Well,

94
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.000
the idea in the case of forest city is to copy that model taking advantage of

95
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:29.130
the similarities between Singapore and Hong Kong

96
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.030
And take notes because we mean copy in the literal sense. In fact,

97
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.300
66% of the entire consortium promoting it,

98
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.860
the so-called country garden Pacific view is owned by the country garden group.

99
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.000
One of China's leading real estate developers based in Fauchon Guangdong

100
00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:50.580
province. Exactly the same province, ashen Zen.

101
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.360
So yes, in fact, they are similar with the story of Shenzhen's developers.

102
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.150
And then the other 34% is owned by the local company, Esplanade Dunga 88,

103
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.260
curiously enough,

104
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.850
the small town of Johor Abraham Ishmael owns more than 64% of the shares in this

105
00:06:12.851 --> 00:06:14.470
company. Yes, that's right.

106
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.160
The sole town of Johor because my friends Malaysia has one of the strangest

107
00:06:18.161 --> 00:06:19.540
political systems on the planet.

108
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.690
Nine of the States that make up the Federation have their own Royal house.

109
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.440
So this is Abraham Ishmael is the sole tan and head of state of Joe Horn.

110
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.740
In an upcoming video, we will go into detail about this particular chaos,

111
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.790
this puzzle, that is the Malaysian political system in any case, as you can see,

112
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.090
no matter how elevated his title, he's not above doing business,

113
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.840
even if it's just to throw his weight behind a real estate deal, what a novelty,

114
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.550
right. But let's continue.

115
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.750
The fact is that it is precisely this majority participation of the Chinese

116
00:06:49.751 --> 00:06:53.530
company country card and group where the controversy over the real purpose of

117
00:06:53.531 --> 00:06:55.660
this project arises because friends,

118
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.770
this project has been openly framed within the well-known one belt one road

119
00:06:59.771 --> 00:07:01.600
initiative, by which, as you well know,

120
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.140
the Chinese president Xi Jinping seeks to expand Chinese influence through

121
00:07:05.141 --> 00:07:08.470
million dollar investments in infrastructure or projects like the one we're

122
00:07:08.471 --> 00:07:11.710
talking about in this video. In fact, just out of curiosity,

123
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.810
if we look more closely at forest city,

124
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.240
at least this first phase that has already been built,

125
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.660
what we find is basically a Chinese city in full force,

126
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.380
a Chinese city in the heart of Malaysia and only two kilometers from Singapore.

127
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:31.720
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

128
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.800
<v 1>And let's see,</v>

129
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:36.820
not only have around 80% of the apartment sold being brought by Chinese

130
00:07:36.821 --> 00:07:40.480
citizens, but also the services and public spaces seem to have been designed.

131
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.880
We have Chinese residents in mind, for example,

132
00:07:42.881 --> 00:07:47.410
the only educational institution currently located in forest city Shattuck is

133
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.890
St. Mary's forest city international school and American school.

134
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.850
It offers education in only two languages, English and Mandarin. No,

135
00:07:54.851 --> 00:07:55.990
Malai on the other hand,

136
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.470
this makes perfect sense because this place is not meant for Malaysians,

137
00:07:59.471 --> 00:08:03.460
but as a hub for ex-pats a small two bedroom apartment costs about

138
00:08:03.461 --> 00:08:07.780
$170,000 a price that is not affordable for the vast majority of Malaysian

139
00:08:07.781 --> 00:08:10.330
workers, not even for those working in Singapore,

140
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.800
Because this is where a whole debate has arisen a debate about the real

141
00:08:17.801 --> 00:08:20.440
sovereignty that underlies this kind of project.

142
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.280
Is it right to let a foreign developer build and sell most of the city of almost

143
00:08:24.281 --> 00:08:28.510
1 million people to the Chinese and to do so in the image of Chinese cities

144
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.810
without taking into account either the population or the local culture,

145
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.380
I invite you to leave your opinion below in the comments. And yes,

146
00:08:35.381 --> 00:08:36.940
I am sure that for many of you,

147
00:08:36.941 --> 00:08:39.910
the answer will be so clear that even the question of debate will seem

148
00:08:39.911 --> 00:08:40.744
preposterous.

149
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:44.380
<v 0>What's the truth.</v>

150
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.850
<v 1>Is that if you think about it,</v>

151
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.900
it is the perfect catalyst for a whole political campaign, the influence of Xi,

152
00:08:49.901 --> 00:08:53.170
Jinping, Malaysia, nationalism, the danger of the Chinese threats,

153
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.060
the lack of access for the local population and so on and so forth. And there,

154
00:08:57.061 --> 00:08:57.660
we have it,

155
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.680
the perfect breeding ground for a pushback political campaign with nationalist

156
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:02.430
overtones,

157
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.850
and you know what that's exactly what's happening to the extent that it could

158
00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:08.280
become one of the main stumbling blocks for this project.

159
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.850
The fact is that at the moment, Malaysian politicians have a kind of love,

160
00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:14.970
hate relationship with this project. You see, on the one hand,

161
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.270
they don't like seeing a Chinese city being built on their territory,

162
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.440
but on the other hand,

163
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:24.180
they don't reject them more than $220 million that Malaysia has already

164
00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:28.110
received in taxes, fees, and licenses. Thanks to this project, all this money,

165
00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:31.530
mind you, when not even a quarter of all the work has been completed,

166
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.270
But no matter what, despite the huge costs, as I mentioned before,

167
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.510
it's the debate on sovereignty that just won't go away. Take a look.

168
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.720
<v 2>In a huge Chinese city in Malaysia,</v>

169
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:48.410
leads to questions about not only our national sovereignty,

170
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.410
but the social contract, which will have to be worked out,

171
00:09:51.411 --> 00:09:55.850
or there will be imbalances Lynn own Malaysia's finance minister.

172
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.340
<v 1>And it's not an isolated opinion. Indeed.</v>

173
00:09:58.341 --> 00:10:02.300
These concerns led to the previous governments that have prime minister Matea

174
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.740
Muhammad to eliminate automatic visas for anyone buying a property in forest

175
00:10:06.741 --> 00:10:09.740
city, which was one of its main attractions. In other words,

176
00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:13.490
you can now buy an apartment, but not automatically enjoy that property.

177
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.200
If you are a foreigner. In fact,

178
00:10:15.201 --> 00:10:18.980
such was the skepticism of the previous prime minister that he went so far as to

179
00:10:18.981 --> 00:10:22.910
say that he would prefer that forest city became a real forest complete with

180
00:10:22.911 --> 00:10:25.910
baboons monkeys and other exotic bugs living in it's crazy,

181
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:27.770
but why so many misgivings,

182
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.640
why so much controversy around a project that was born with the aim of becoming

183
00:10:31.641 --> 00:10:35.750
an icon of national pride and a first class economic engine,

184
00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:39.560
what future or waitress this new mega city that is already under construction?

185
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.530
What exactly is driving the interest of the Chinese government?

186
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:46.310
Is there something hidden lurking behind all those imposing towers and the

187
00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:50.540
promotional videos that depicts this place almost as paradise? Well, listen up.

188
00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.980
<v 0>Behind the scenes.</v>

189
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.690
<v 1>Okay. If one thing is clear in this whole story,</v>

190
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.760
it is that forest city exists and is where it is solely because of the existence

191
00:11:07.761 --> 00:11:08.480
of Singapore.

192
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.410
The city state has served in this case as is almost always the case as a conduit

193
00:11:12.411 --> 00:11:15.650
of investment and capital attraction, not only for the city itself,

194
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:17.000
but also for the region around it,

195
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.820
which is much poorer because if the plans are completed,

196
00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:23.960
forest city will have a large area of offices and commercial activity and even

197
00:11:23.961 --> 00:11:27.500
its own industrial areas in the near future, which who knows,

198
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.500
could rival Singapore itself, at least according to the plans.

199
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.370
The truth is however that the objective of this macro project is not solely

200
00:11:34.371 --> 00:11:35.204
healthy content.

201
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.193
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

202
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:42.230
<v 1>The aim is to bring China's economic tentacles closer to the city state,</v>

203
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:45.200
a major international economic center in this way,

204
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.570
not only a multitude of Chinese consumers,

205
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.690
those with sufficient purchasing power to buy a house there, of course,

206
00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.130
but also tens and tens hundreds, Chinese companies,

207
00:11:54.131 --> 00:11:57.310
and the thousands of professionals will be able to establish themselves on

208
00:11:57.311 --> 00:11:59.080
preferential terms alongside them.

209
00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.630
<v 0>In other words, just to be really.</v>

210
00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.380
<v 1>The main idea behind the Chinese government supporting this initiative is to</v>

211
00:12:07.381 --> 00:12:08.910
build a whole Chinese city,

212
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:13.170
a city adapted and focused on the Chinese population and professionals right

213
00:12:13.171 --> 00:12:16.290
next to Singapore itself. In fact, the main development company,

214
00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.220
the Chinese country garden is a company that specializes and practically

215
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:24.450
exclusively in the marketing of real estate spaces among Chinese citizens.

216
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.870
This is one of the reasons why investors in forest city are basically all

217
00:12:27.871 --> 00:12:31.770
Chinese. In fact, only a handful of Malaysians, Singaporeans, Indonesians,

218
00:12:31.771 --> 00:12:32.310
Koreans,

219
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:36.570
and the occasional Japanese and Hong Kong among other small nationality groups

220
00:12:36.571 --> 00:12:37.380
have purchased.

221
00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:38.213
<v 0>Property there.</v>

222
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:41.851
<v 1>In other words,</v>

223
00:12:41.851 --> 00:12:45.930
we're talking about what may in practice be a powerful business cluster with

224
00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:49.800
which Chinese companies will achieve a privileged situation when doing business

225
00:12:49.801 --> 00:12:51.870
in Singapore. Can you imagine that? I don't know,

226
00:12:51.871 --> 00:12:55.650
from Chinese schools to lawyers who understand China's legal framework for city

227
00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:59.010
has been designed to be a meeting point between professionals living in

228
00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:01.950
Singapore and the Chinese market. And if you think about it for a moment,

229
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.800
it's a clever way to expand the influence of the Chinese economy,

230
00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.610
a method by the way, that is as surprising as it is capitalist.

231
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:12.120
After all it is based on private investment profitability and the premise of

232
00:13:12.121 --> 00:13:15.930
generating competitive advantages for their companies. And at the same time,

233
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.390
it could become a golden opportunity for Malaysia,

234
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:22.680
a tremendous economic engine to develop the South of the country and turn it

235
00:13:22.681 --> 00:13:25.860
into a source of wealth. Of course it is not all that simple

236
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:30.840
As far as the problems of sovereignty goes,

237
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.560
which mind you is not exactly a minor issue. Can you imagine, I don't know,

238
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.310
the Chinese government coming to claim the sovereignty of a city built inside

239
00:13:38.311 --> 00:13:39.144
your borders,

240
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:42.420
in which hundreds and thousands of Chinese citizens live and which has been

241
00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:43.830
built with Chinese capital.

242
00:13:43.831 --> 00:13:45.960
And if the track record of Beijing has anything to go by,

243
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.690
the concerns don't seem that crazy well to this political issue,

244
00:13:48.691 --> 00:13:52.560
we can add other concerns that always always crop up with this type of project.

245
00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.870
For example, the complaints of the local population,

246
00:13:54.871 --> 00:13:57.900
about the impact that this city could have on the fishing sector,

247
00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:00.600
the main economic activity supporting residents today.

248
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:01.613
<v 0>Right?</v>

249
00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:07.020
<v 1>I already told you, forest city is being built on four reclaimed islands.</v>

250
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.630
It is located next to the mouth of the Pula river,

251
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.770
where the mangrove forest reserve of the Pula river is located well due to the

252
00:14:13.771 --> 00:14:17.340
change in the title of dynamics that this new artificial coast generates many

253
00:14:17.341 --> 00:14:20.670
experts think that a part of these protected mangroves could disappear.

254
00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:21.210
Similarly,

255
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:25.620
the area's native foreigner could also be affected as the 30 different species

256
00:14:25.621 --> 00:14:29.520
of algae that provide the natural habitat of dugongs and sea turtles.

257
00:14:29.521 --> 00:14:31.280
Both endangered species could be.

258
00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:32.573
<v 0>Affect it.</v>

259
00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.540
<v 1>On top of the environmental doubts.</v>

260
00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:40.380
We must now add to the doubts about the economic viability of the project in the

261
00:14:40.381 --> 00:14:44.880
short and medium term due to, well, you know, the effects of the coronavirus.

262
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:46.860
<v 3>Before Corona virus,</v>

263
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:50.790
the sales showroom was always crowded and sales were very positive.

264
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.060
Even phases were already sold out,

265
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.850
but since March sales have dropped over 90%,

266
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:59.750
and typically there are no visitors member of the forest city sales team for

267
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.940
Nika Asian review.

268
00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:04.120
<v 1>And of course, given the circumstances, the big question is now,</v>

269
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:07.780
will the project go ahead as it was intended or when it's simply remained one of

270
00:15:07.781 --> 00:15:11.290
those numerous large doomed real estate projects that have been built with

271
00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.130
Chinese capital in various locations. So there you have it with this video,

272
00:15:15.131 --> 00:15:19.570
we wanted to present one of the most ingenious ways in which GGN pings one belt,

273
00:15:19.571 --> 00:15:23.860
one road program aimed to extend the tentacles of the economic and financial

274
00:15:23.861 --> 00:15:27.010
fabric of China. But having given you the rundown now, it's your turn.

275
00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.320
What do you think of this whole forest macro project?

276
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:32.110
