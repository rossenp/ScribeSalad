00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.810
<v 0>This video is brought to you by blinkers now.</v>

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.900
Like it's not always easy to find the time to sit down and read all the books

3
00:00:06.901 --> 00:00:09.120
you want to look. I'm a pretty busy dude myself.

4
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:11.400
So I understand that I don't read as much as I would.

5
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:14.850
Like I don't read as much as I used to. It's all a bit of a shame,

6
00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:18.750
but good news. I've got Blinkist, which is this app that you can download.

7
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:19.584
And in this app,

8
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.400
there are 15 minutes summaries of all the best non-fiction books.

9
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:28.200
Over 3000 of them entire soul. You can either read them or listen to them,

10
00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:31.230
both options there for me, I listen 90% of the time.

11
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:34.710
Like it's easy to fit into the day like that commute to work, or, uh, you know,

12
00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:38.310
just doing little tasks around the house. It's pretty perfect.

13
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:42.150
I'll say 12 million active users currently use Blinkist and they're getting the

14
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:46.890
best insights and needs no info from thousands of books. Self-help to business,

15
00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:49.020
to health, whatever you're into it's on there.

16
00:00:49.021 --> 00:00:53.040
They also have excellent curated lists where the Blinkist team and also guests

17
00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:56.550
to put together some specific recommendations. Like what have we got here?

18
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.950
How to future-proof yourself? Well, that's a good one.

19
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.970
And also a staff favorites. Of course you want to know what they think.

20
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:05.670
And of course you can download all of these, listened to them,

21
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.490
read them offline. It's all pretty fantastic.

22
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.680
I've read a bunch of stuff on here. They're 15 minutes.

23
00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:14.460
They easy to whip through, and it's just very dense information.

24
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.150
The first hundred people to go to blinkist.com forward slash visual politic.

25
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.560
We'll get one week to try it out.

26
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.610
You'll also get 25% off if you want the full membership and let's get into it.

27
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.540
If we mentioned espionage, it'll likely trigger a movie scene,

28
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.020
starring Sean Connery, Roger Moore, or Pierce Brosnan. I mean,

29
00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:45.740
who doesn't remember agent [inaudible] classic Aston Martin.

30
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.920
<v 1>However.</v>

31
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.700
<v 0>Fortunately,</v>

32
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.600
or unfortunately the truth is that real world espionage has little to do with

33
00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:57.170
the crazy and glamorous life of James bonds. It makes sense. I mean,

34
00:01:57.171 --> 00:02:01.070
who in their right mind would go to see a movie in which Prius Brosnan spent 120

35
00:02:01.071 --> 00:02:03.980
minutes listening to phone calls or collecting metadata.

36
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.010
That's what it boils down to from ancient Rome to the present day.

37
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.820
This has basically been the mission of intelligence services to know what is

38
00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:15.920
being said and who is saying it.

39
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.460
Yes,

40
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.880
Julius Caesar may not have had powerful computer equipment or satellites at his

41
00:02:22.881 --> 00:02:25.970
disposal, but he was sped several times from death.

42
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.660
Thanks to having a powerful network of informants at his service. In fact,

43
00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:33.410
it's even been said that he might've been aware of the conspiracy that finally

44
00:02:33.411 --> 00:02:37.550
ended his life. For another example,

45
00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:40.460
the French revolution started by Robert P Erin's company.

46
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.790
Most likely would not have been possible without an intelligence network,

47
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.160
either. Not at least in the way that it occurred.

48
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.610
The revolutionary governments had intelligence committees spread across the

49
00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:52.220
country that would dedicate to do identifying, monitoring,

50
00:02:52.221 --> 00:02:55.550
and arresting any noble foreign or Frenchmen who returned from abroad.

51
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.770
And it would be against the movement to give you an idea.

52
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.570
Some historians estimate the number of people monitored by this huge network is

53
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.130
almost.

54
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.963
<v 1>Half a million.</v>

55
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.810
<v 0>Plus, we're going to jump from the 18th century to 2013.</v>

56
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.650
Was that here and leak from a technology consultant say until then,

57
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.260
unknown Edward Snowden shook all the seats.

58
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.293
<v 1>We are in Washington.</v>

59
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.770
<v 0>Journalists from the Washington post and the guardian,</v>

60
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.350
the national security agency, employee links,

61
00:03:25.351 --> 00:03:28.980
documents classified as top secret revealing the existence of several

62
00:03:28.981 --> 00:03:32.850
intelligence programs, programs that collected metadata from us, citizens.

63
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.350
<v 1>In bulk. But what exactly? Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.320
<v 0>Where are these programs? What is the NSA really?</v>

65
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.850
And what role did nine 11 play in terms of privacy? Well, watch closely,

66
00:03:44.851 --> 00:03:47.850
because in this video, we're going to answer all of these questions.

67
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.220
<v 1>The secret agency</v>

68
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.180
on the 20th of May.

69
00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.120
<v 0>1949, then you are secretary of defense Louis.</v>

70
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.530
A Johnson created the AFSA, the armed forces security agency,

71
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.460
its purpose was to coordinate all electronic communications and intelligence

72
00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:12.420
findings of the different agencies, belonging to the armed forces agencies,

73
00:04:12.421 --> 00:04:14.670
such as the air force security service, all the Marines.

74
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.630
However, the AFSA was a resounding failure.

75
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.110
The rivalry between the different agencies were so great in the ends.

76
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.260
They've never shared all the information with a central organization.

77
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.660
<v 1>It.</v>

78
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.310
<v 0>Is precisely for this reason and because the AFSA has ended up being totally</v>

79
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.300
inoperative and is unable to respond to the needs posed by the new cold war.

80
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.940
The president Truman decided in June,

81
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.180
1952 to make us stand and Mount something completely new.

82
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.110
And this way he authorized the creation of a new secret agency.

83
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.820
He did it through a confidential memo,

84
00:04:50.821 --> 00:04:53.760
specifically at the ends of the seventh page of the documents.

85
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.600
They were brief lines that would change the history of espionage and Norway.

86
00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.620
<v 1>That's America forever.</v>

87
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.963
Can you imagine.

88
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.810
<v 0>Dictating the document to a secretary off to six pages? All of a sudden, Oh,</v>

89
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:07.411
Hey, yes.

90
00:05:07.411 --> 00:05:10.260
Look also put in the point where we're going to create that mega agency,

91
00:05:10.261 --> 00:05:13.350
but you know, don't let anyone know, especially in our Congress, please,

92
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.010
That's how the NSA was born. Very sneakily. However,

93
00:05:20.011 --> 00:05:22.050
it would not be until more than 20 years later,

94
00:05:22.051 --> 00:05:26.130
that it was publicly known that this agency even existed. In fact,

95
00:05:26.131 --> 00:05:30.420
it was learned about by investigations carried out in 1975 by the Senate,

96
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.880
since the possible abuses of us intelligence services.

97
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.960
<v 1>Was.</v>

98
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.730
<v 0>And that the church committee revealed that there was an agency with a</v>

99
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.570
multi-million dollar budgets and agency that no one had ever heard of.

100
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.410
Even the sentences themselves did not give credence to the scale that the NSA

101
00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:47.244
had reached.

102
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.190
Unlike the CIA, which was created through Congress,

103
00:05:53.191 --> 00:05:55.620
the NSA had been launched directly Boeing,

104
00:05:55.621 --> 00:06:00.080
the executive branch that is by the United States government itself for decades,

105
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:02.150
the white house carried out painstaking work,

106
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.110
let it go completely unnoticed while the organization kept growing and growing.

107
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.580
But in Congress, they couldn't believe it.

108
00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.500
They had just discovered that the NSA,

109
00:06:14.501 --> 00:06:18.850
a virtually unknown organization was not only a larger agency than the CIA

110
00:06:18.851 --> 00:06:23.020
itself, but was in fact larger than all the other intelligence agencies,

111
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.800
correct.

112
00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.633
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

113
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.000
<v 0>To get an idea of its size. The last known fact is that in 1978,</v>

114
00:06:31.001 --> 00:06:33.850
and despite the concept brought by the end of the Vietnam war,

115
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.260
the NSA workforce amounted to 68,203 employees,

116
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.860
this is more than half of Apple's employees worldwide.

117
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.250
And remember all of this was done in absolute secrecy.

118
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.590
<v 2>Despite its size and power,</v>

119
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.540
no law has ever been enacted prohibiting the NSA from engaging in any activity.

120
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.800
There are only laws to prohibit the release of any information about the agency.

121
00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.760
No statute establishes the NSC or defines the permissible scope of its

122
00:07:00.761 --> 00:07:04.540
responsibilities, Frank Church, former Senate intelligence committee.

123
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:07.150
<v 0>And if this already seems surprising, well,</v>

124
00:07:07.151 --> 00:07:09.850
hold on because the story doesn't end here.

125
00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:10.863
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

126
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.510
<v 0>The Senate also discovered that the NSA had dedicated itself to tapping the</v>

127
00:07:16.511 --> 00:07:20.920
phones of nearly 1,700 us citizens. Even back in 1969,

128
00:07:20.921 --> 00:07:24.730
the Nixon administration came to name this particular list of people to watch.

129
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.760
It would be known as operation minarets. It was a scandal,

130
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.860
such prominent characters as Martin Luther King,

131
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.850
Jane Fonda and Muhammad Ali were parts of this curious NSA blacklist.

132
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.313
<v 1>Oh.</v>

133
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:37.391
<v 0>In fact,</v>

134
00:07:37.391 --> 00:07:40.900
the paranoia of the Nixon administration was such that they even engaged in

135
00:07:40.901 --> 00:07:42.880
spying on their own people. For example,

136
00:07:42.881 --> 00:07:45.670
well-known Tennessee Republican Senator Howard Baker,

137
00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.700
who became majority leader in the Senate and was later president Ronald

138
00:07:48.701 --> 00:07:51.880
Reagan's. Chief of staff was also on the NSA's list of suspects

139
00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:56.530
1978.

140
00:07:56.531 --> 00:08:00.310
And probably as a result of discovering the opaque and controversial workings of

141
00:08:00.311 --> 00:08:03.070
the NSA Congress approves the so-called FISA,

142
00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:07.660
the foreign intelligence surveillance act FISA legally put brakes on the NSA's

143
00:08:07.661 --> 00:08:10.300
freedom to listen to who they wanted from that point on,

144
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.360
since the passing of that, nor the NSA could only intercepts,

145
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.300
he listened to communications that took place abroad,

146
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.880
expressly prohibiting surveillance of us citizens,

147
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.850
except in the case of those acting as spies from other countries.

148
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:22.743
<v 1>Sorry.</v>

149
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.870
<v 0>Just to gain faeces approval to initiate citizen monitoring,</v>

150
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:33.100
the NSA needed to obtain a court order, which, you know, all seems pretty right.

151
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:36.910
<v 1>Well.</v>

152
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:40.540
<v 0>Hang on a moment because there was an event that would completely change the</v>

153
00:08:40.541 --> 00:08:42.190
boundaries of this agency.

154
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.080
<v 1>Good evening today, our fellow citizens,</v>

155
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.640
our way of life,

156
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:54.250
our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly

157
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.473
terrorist.

158
00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.160
<v 2>The day that changed everything.</v>

159
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.030
<v 0>There is a date on the calendar that was market turning point for the U S</v>

160
00:09:05.031 --> 00:09:08.600
national security agency, September the 11th, 2001. Yeah.

161
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.180
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

162
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.310
<v 0>Decades off to that fateful day.</v>

163
00:09:13.311 --> 00:09:17.000
We could almost certainly say that nine 11 has been the most consequential

164
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:20.810
terrorist operation in human history. On that day, 19 jihadists,

165
00:09:20.811 --> 00:09:25.010
3000 innocent lives and iconic building the twin towers of the world trade

166
00:09:25.011 --> 00:09:28.550
center, and four passenger planes disappeared from the face of the earth.

167
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.460
But not only that, there was a lot that was not destroyed,

168
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:34.730
but was damaged in some cases forever. Thousands of wounded,

169
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.870
the strategic Pentagon building and to country, that would never be the same.

170
00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.053
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

171
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.690
<v 0>No 11 disrupted the political agenda of the Bush administration.</v>

172
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.600
And we're not just talking about the Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq

173
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.450
Practically gave then president Bush,

174
00:09:53.451 --> 00:09:56.120
a blank check to use the armed forces in any way.

175
00:09:56.121 --> 00:10:00.020
He deemed necessary to persecute and punish anyone who had been involved in the

176
00:10:00.021 --> 00:10:03.890
attacks and that wasn't all a month after nine 11 Congress passed the Patriot

177
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.850
act law that empowered them to fight terrorism with the same tactics that they

178
00:10:07.851 --> 00:10:11.180
could employ to find organized crime or drug trafficking. For example,

179
00:10:11.181 --> 00:10:12.440
thanks to the Patriot acts.

180
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:16.790
Agents could gain access to a terrorist suspected call history, travel plans,

181
00:10:16.791 --> 00:10:19.880
or any other information available from other federal agencies.

182
00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.730
<v 2>Today, we take an essential step in defeating terrorism while protecting the</v>

183
00:10:25.731 --> 00:10:29.690
constitutional rights of all Americans. With my signature,

184
00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:33.530
this law will give intelligence and law enforcement officials important new

185
00:10:33.531 --> 00:10:36.500
tools to fight a present danger.

186
00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.050
<v 1>But it didn't end that.</v>

187
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.570
<v 0>It's definitely been a slap in the face for someone.</v>

188
00:10:41.571 --> 00:10:43.850
It was a slap in the face for the intelligence agents.

189
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.530
It was clear more intelligence was needed in 2002 president Bush signed a

190
00:10:51.531 --> 00:10:52.910
presidential secret order,

191
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.690
an order allowing the NSA to monitor calls and emails from thousands of us,

192
00:10:56.691 --> 00:10:59.990
citizens and legal residents without having to seek a court order.

193
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.850
It was the birth of the stellar Winnsboro.

194
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:10.130
The icing on the cake came in 2005 with the appointments of a new director for

195
00:11:10.131 --> 00:11:10.790
the NSA,

196
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:15.050
the man who signified a new era in the history of the NSA and by extension,

197
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.100
the history of espionage.

198
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.233
<v 1>Gosh.</v>

199
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.030
<v 2>A cowboy in Washington.</v>

200
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:26.361
<v 0>On August,</v>

201
00:11:26.361 --> 00:11:30.650
the first 2005 general Keith Alexander was appointed as the 16th director of the

202
00:11:30.651 --> 00:11:33.170
NSA serving in office for a total of nine years.

203
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.830
No director of the agency has ever served that long. And of course,

204
00:11:36.831 --> 00:11:40.130
no director has had so much power in his hands before this character,

205
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.930
his ambition was simply unprecedented.

206
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.340
<v 2>Alexander tended to be a bit of a cowboy. Let's not worry about the law.</v>

207
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.820
Let's just figure out how to get the job done says a former intelligence

208
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.920
official. He said at one point, a lot of things clearly legal,

209
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.360
but that doesn't make them illegal.

210
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.240
A former military intelligence officer who served under Alexander at

211
00:11:59.800 --> 00:11:59.970
[inaudible].

212
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.880
<v 0>Apparently Alexander seems like the perfect guy for the job.</v>

213
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:06.480
He was a senior decorated intelligence officer, a graduate of West point.

214
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:10.020
He specialized in physics and technology. For example, during the Iraq war,

215
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:13.440
he pioneered tools to monitor all communications calls, emails,

216
00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.600
messages coming out of Iraq in real time.

217
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.040
However, his predecessor,

218
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.760
former NSA director general Michael Hayden could not stand the sight of

219
00:12:23.761 --> 00:12:25.950
Alexander. Of course Alexander had not one,

220
00:12:25.951 --> 00:12:28.710
but two ACEs up his sleeve to take the top seat. First,

221
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.650
he knew Hayden hated then defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld.

222
00:12:31.651 --> 00:12:33.530
So he made Rumsfeld his first target.

223
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:38.400
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

224
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.240
<v 0>He knew how to move around Washington like a fish in water. Well,</v>

225
00:12:41.241 --> 00:12:44.130
let's just say he knew how to charm the people that you need to do in order to

226
00:12:44.131 --> 00:12:45.240
achieve all of his goals.

227
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.570
Now four-star general was running an intelligence command in Virginia,

228
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.510
near Washington, to give you an idea of the kind of person we're talking about.

229
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.090
He set up a Hollywood like set in those facilities,

230
00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.540
specifically a replica of the star Trek enterprises command.

231
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:05.130
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

232
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:07.800
<v 0>Yeah. You might be wondering why on earth did he do that?</v>

233
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.520
Well from this command post, you control the screens and computers.

234
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.220
If it's so-called information, domain center and not just that in this way,

235
00:13:14.221 --> 00:13:16.740
every time he invited a politician to tour the facility,

236
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.920
he ended up seating his guest and the seat belonging to the captain of the

237
00:13:19.921 --> 00:13:23.100
enterprise. And you know what? Politicians freaked out. They gave him.

238
00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:24.563
<v 1>Loved.</v>

239
00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:28.770
<v 0>It's hard to believe,</v>

240
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.370
but with techniques like this general Xander somehow managed to get everyone on

241
00:13:32.371 --> 00:13:36.600
his side. And yes, that's also how he became the director of the powerful NSA.

242
00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:39.660
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

243
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.830
<v 0>But let's not get distracted. The fact is the during Alexander's long tenure,</v>

244
00:13:43.831 --> 00:13:47.430
one of his main objectives was to renew the agency, technologically,

245
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:51.120
perhaps one of the characters that best illustrates the changes that occurred in

246
00:13:51.121 --> 00:13:52.890
this organization is Edward Snowden.

247
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:56.670
And with Alexandra at the helm,

248
00:13:56.671 --> 00:13:59.100
the agency was filled with fresh young personnel.

249
00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.940
Overnight 20 somethings were walking around the NSA facilities with levels of

250
00:14:02.941 --> 00:14:05.880
access that even the most senior agents had never gained,

251
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.590
but digital age had arrived.

252
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:12.240
<v 2>I was decades younger than the help desk folks and heading past them into a volt</v>

253
00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.570
to which they didn't have access and never would Edward Snowden.

254
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.970
<v 0>With its new payroll signings, Alexandra revamped,</v>

255
00:14:17.971 --> 00:14:20.820
the NSA and began carrying out new espionage program.

256
00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:21.893
<v 1>Yes.</v>

257
00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.280
<v 0>It was controversial was the prison program with it's.</v>

258
00:14:26.281 --> 00:14:29.850
The NSA began storing information from the internet and technology companies,

259
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.920
emails, video chat, social media messages.

260
00:14:31.921 --> 00:14:35.790
Everything was within reach of agency analysts to look for clues about.

261
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:40.140
<v 1>New terrorist threats. In fact.</v>

262
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:44.580
<v 0>Information was stored by this agency that the NSA ran out of storage capacity</v>

263
00:14:44.581 --> 00:14:49.530
on its 141 hectors at Fort Meade that do expands their hard drive by setting up

264
00:14:49.531 --> 00:14:53.660
a facility in the middle of the Utah desert that cost them more than $2 billion.

265
00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:56.510
<v 1>But do you know.</v>

266
00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:00.020
<v 0>How many people are estimated to have been monitored by the NSA with this</v>

267
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:02.150
program? How many terrorist suspects? Well,

268
00:15:02.151 --> 00:15:06.230
it's estimated that the amounts could run to tens of millions of Americans. Yep.

269
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.150
That's right. Tens of millions.

270
00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:12.110
How did the NSA legally justify monitoring so many people?

271
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.540
Well, as the saying goes well, there's a law, there's a loophole. Chris English,

272
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:22.840
the deputy director of the agency stated in Congress that when a potential

273
00:15:22.841 --> 00:15:26.530
terrorist was under surveillance communications from people related to them were

274
00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.170
investigators up to a certain degree of connection.

275
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:32.921
And of course,

276
00:15:32.921 --> 00:15:36.850
if we take into account that a recent study conducted by the university of Milan

277
00:15:36.851 --> 00:15:39.310
in conjunction with Facebook, estimated that at present,

278
00:15:39.311 --> 00:15:42.190
we are all connected with about 4.7 degrees of separation.

279
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.480
And the three degrees used by the NSA does look a bit, let's say excessive.

280
00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.670
It was a bit of a joke because in practice they just had free reign to

281
00:15:51.671 --> 00:15:53.260
investigate whoever they wanted.

282
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:54.670
<v 2>Xander.</v>

283
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:58.300
He had all these diagrams showing how this guy was connected to that guy and to

284
00:15:58.301 --> 00:15:58.950
that guy.

285
00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:02.680
So says a former NSA official who haired Alexander give briefings on the floor

286
00:16:02.681 --> 00:16:04.390
of the information dominance center.

287
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.870
Some of my colleagues and I were skeptical laser,

288
00:16:07.871 --> 00:16:09.610
we had a chance to review the information.

289
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:13.330
It turns out that all that those guys were connected to where pizza shops are

290
00:16:13.331 --> 00:16:16.540
retired. Military officer who worked with Alexander, all this.

291
00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:18.850
<v 0>I got very much out of hands for the NSA document.</v>

292
00:16:18.851 --> 00:16:21.790
Leaks revealed to them more than 10 million phone calls were intercepted in

293
00:16:21.791 --> 00:16:23.410
Spain and France alone. In fact,

294
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.500
many of you may remember this embarrassing moment during the Obama

295
00:16:26.501 --> 00:16:28.570
administration, Obama.

296
00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.600
<v 2>Approved tapping Angela Merkel's phone three years ago,</v>

297
00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:36.040
president Barack Obama was told about monitoring of German chancellor in 2010

298
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.050
and allowed it to continue Telegraph.

299
00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:42.310
<v 0>Emails of the then president of Mexico for Lebeck outer on and 35.</v>

300
00:16:42.311 --> 00:16:43.144
Other heads of

301
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.940
Extend to the program was such that Snowden himself began to recognize that

302
00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:52.120
there were NSA employees who were spying on their ex partners or whoever they

303
00:16:52.121 --> 00:16:53.860
wanted with absolute impunity.

304
00:16:58.690 --> 00:16:59.560
So the agency itself,

305
00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:02.470
the benefits have been quite small compared to the cost and resources used.

306
00:17:02.471 --> 00:17:06.130
It seems that using such a large amount of data in practice was not easy.

307
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.900
Say that at the moment of reckoning,

308
00:17:13.901 --> 00:17:18.160
the program was used bore to spy on the girlfriends of agency employees and

309
00:17:18.161 --> 00:17:21.340
things like that than it was used to fight terrorism as well.

310
00:17:21.341 --> 00:17:23.770
Also spying on political leaders like Merkel,

311
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.650
but how can we be sure that this no longer continues in any case?

312
00:17:26.651 --> 00:17:29.950
The agreed goal was not to violate the privacy of millions of people around the

313
00:17:29.951 --> 00:17:32.470
world and to spend billions of dollars in the process.

314
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:34.810
<v 1>Anyway.</v>

315
00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:38.440
<v 0>That is the story of one of the most covert intelligence agencies in the world.</v>

316
00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:41.170
An agency that for more than 20 years was de facto his,

317
00:17:41.171 --> 00:17:42.490
and even to the United States,

318
00:17:42.491 --> 00:17:46.120
Congress and agency whose daily activities we have no idea about.

319
00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.940
But we do know that it was able to unscrupulously violate the,

320
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.680
of millions of innocent citizens among them businessmen, politicians,

321
00:17:52.681 --> 00:17:55.890
and journalists. And that should cause us to ask ourselves a few questions.

322
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.860
Do you think it is appropriate for a government dependent body to have such a

323
00:17:58.861 --> 00:17:59.640
degree of freedom?

324
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.150
Would you be willing to sacrifice all your privacy to supposedly strengthen

325
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:04.170
national security?

326
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.560
What control do you think that these kinds of agencies should have while leave

327
00:18:07.561 --> 00:18:10.890
us your answers in the comments below also sooner at visual politic?

328
00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.870
