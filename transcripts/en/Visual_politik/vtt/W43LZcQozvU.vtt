<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.690
<v 1>America is suffering the most violent protests in their recent history.</v>

3
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.130
Since summer 2020,

4
00:00:13.131 --> 00:00:16.850
we can already kind of several people killed a political skirmishes between far

5
00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:18.350
right and left activists.

6
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.970
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

7
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.780
<v 1>It's like Portland and Seattle have been swamped by groups like the Boogaloo</v>

8
00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:30.620
boys who claimed to belong to the alt-right and support to president Trump,

9
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.550
others like Antifa belong to the other side of political spectrum.

10
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.880
It seems America is more polarized than ever.

11
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.310
It will be a surprise to no one.

12
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.880
This is not the only country where political rivalry is growing.

13
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.340
Maybe your country is also going through the same trend.

14
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.690
Democratic societies are becoming increasingly divided by two extremes.

15
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.710
Sometimes if we would take Twitter as a window to see reality as a whole,

16
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.030
it would look like we're on the edge of a new civil war and not the cool one.

17
00:01:02.031 --> 00:01:03.380
Like with Marvel superhero.

18
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.273
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.980
<v 1>Nevertheless, you know, here at visual politics, we care about the facts.</v>

20
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.090
This is why we are wondering to what extent is polarization really something new

21
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.400
in the United States? I mean, think about it.

22
00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:18.740
And every democracy there is a right and the left wing.

23
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.550
The seldom agree on the SU's politics is always a debate.

24
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.260
So can we really say America is more polarized now than what it was 13 years

25
00:01:27.261 --> 00:01:28.094
ago.

26
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.480
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

27
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.040
<v 1>Answering these questions are rather complicated because we cannot measure</v>

28
00:01:34.041 --> 00:01:37.610
political opinions the same way we can measure save economic growth.

29
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.450
Nevertheless,

30
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.780
many analysts have already found someone to blame for this would be

31
00:01:41.781 --> 00:01:46.070
polarization. And you have probably guessed food according to many,

32
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.010
the source for all this protest, as the current president,

33
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.820
Donald Trump and truth being what it is, news Lake.

34
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.650
This is kind of scary.

35
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.290
<v 0>Okay.</v>

36
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.080
<v 2>Trump won't commit to peaceful transfer of power.</v>

37
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.920
<v 1>Points.</v>

38
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.700
I know many of you might be thinking isn't blaming Trump for polarization,

39
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.610
a polarized opinion and an of itself. I mean, think about it.

40
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.170
If you are a Trump supporter,

41
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.530
you may believe that it is the liberals who are polarizing public opinion.

42
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.160
And there are many examples of polarizing and extremist politicians on the

43
00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:20.360
American left too.

44
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.730
So as you can see, this is a very complex topic.

45
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.160
This is why in order to analyze this issue,

46
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.530
we are going to ask an expert on the matter.

47
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.010
And he is someone very well known by all the visual politic community.

48
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.020
Today we are going to have on Eric phone,

49
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.690
aside from being one of the voices that you hear and our videos,

50
00:02:41.691 --> 00:02:45.620
Eric is the host of the reconsider media podcast and the co-author of a book

51
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.760
called wet.

52
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.540
How did you become a tool for the partisan and political establishment?

53
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.200
<v 2>Hello, grant and hello to all the visual politics, subscribers,</v>

54
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.060
Dans are your questions quickly first? Yes, America is much more polarized.

55
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.030
It was decades ago. And to no, Trump is not to blame. If anything,

56
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.680
Trump is a symptom of a phenomenon that has been going on since the

57
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:09.580
seventies.

58
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.490
<v 1>That being said, today's question is what do we mean by polarization?</v>

59
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.100
And how can we measure it? Where does it come from?

60
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.780
Is it really a problem or is it something quintessential to any democracy today?

61
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.260
We are going to answer all of these questions, but before we do,

62
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.123
let's take a look at something.

63
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.890
<v 0>Big ideological.</v>

64
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.910
<v 1>Wedge before we get started today. Let me ask you a key question.</v>

65
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.020
Where would you like to live? Would you like to live in a big house,

66
00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:42.090
on a quiet sparsely populated area,

67
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.790
or would you rather live in a downtown apartment?

68
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.850
If your priority is the size and the quality of the house,

69
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.600
chances are you're leaning towards the right wing of the political spectrum.

70
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.030
If your priority is to live in a lively area,

71
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.940
then you may fall on the left wing of the political spectrum.

72
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.940
At least this is what a Pew research survey concludes.

73
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.920
65% of the conservative voters like beggar houses and less densely populated

74
00:04:04.921 --> 00:04:05.490
areas.

75
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.470
While 61% of liberals prepared to sacrifice size and favor of being

76
00:04:10.471 --> 00:04:11.790
an alively urban.

77
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:16.380
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

78
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.280
<v 1>I just gave you this example to show you how ideology is not a bad thing and</v>

79
00:04:20.281 --> 00:04:21.360
itself. In fact,

80
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.320
being conservative or left wing does not only affect us when it comes into

81
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.410
voltage. It also influences our hobbies and our lifestyle,

82
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.220
but this is not all another point we have to mention here is that polarization

83
00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:35.220
is not the same as political extremism.

84
00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.480
The fact that America is more polarized doesn't necessarily mean that is getting

85
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.350
more extreme.

86
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.490
<v 2>In fact, in many aspects, the opposite is true. For example,</v>

87
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.810
in the year 1994,

88
00:04:45.811 --> 00:04:50.760
only 30% of Republicans supported gay marriage by 2014 that had Rose to

89
00:04:50.761 --> 00:04:53.100
54%. And it continues to climb.

90
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:57.300
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

91
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.180
<v 2>Even on topics like immigration, the left and right agree,</v>

92
00:05:00.181 --> 00:05:05.010
more than ever over 61% of Republicans believe that immigration is a good

93
00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:05.550
thing.

94
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.170
And Americans agree in broad squads on issues such as healthcare and

95
00:05:10.171 --> 00:05:11.004
climate change.

96
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.510
<v 1>Now you might wonder then what do we mean when we see America is more polarized</v>

97
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.480
polarization, doesn't come from voters getting more extreme,

98
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.850
but more exclusively consistent. Instead.

99
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.710
You're wondering then what do we mean when we say that America is getting more

100
00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:32.580
polarized polarization, doesn't come from voters getting more extreme,

101
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.100
but more exclusively, consistent and steady,

102
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.410
but what does it mean to be more consistent?

103
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.970
We could define consistency as buying the whole ideological pack that a party is

104
00:05:41.971 --> 00:05:44.100
selling. For example, for years,

105
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.520
the Pew research center has been conducting a survey where they give you a

106
00:05:47.521 --> 00:05:49.230
questionnaire on this questionnaire.

107
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.440
You have two options to choose from for each policy question.

108
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.460
One is the conservative option and the other is the liberal option.

109
00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.290
For instance, one question is what is the best way to ensure peace?

110
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.670
Is it a through military strength or is it be through diplomacy?

111
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.330
Another example is what do you think about environmental regulations?

112
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.140
A they are bonds because they Hartley economy and jobs or B,

113
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.330
they are good because they protect our planet.

114
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.360
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

115
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.290
<v 1>And I'm pretty sure I don't need to tell you there,</v>

116
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.570
which one is the conservative or the liberal option.

117
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.900
I'm sure many of you would have answers from one or the other site,

118
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.530
but if you answer all the questions on the same site,

119
00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.090
then you would be considered a consistent liberal or a consistent conservative

120
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.350
of course, being totally consistent with one ideology is a rare thing.

121
00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.230
This is why they give you a score based on all of your answers.

122
00:06:41.231 --> 00:06:44.800
And then they determine the median of Republicans and Democrats scores.

123
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.200
And this is how they made this.

124
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.720
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

125
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.570
<v 1>The attention to the graph. You will see that over time,</v>

126
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.290
ideological medians have gone more to the extremes. Again,

127
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.650
this doesn't mean that people are going far right or far left,

128
00:07:02.651 --> 00:07:05.950
but they are becoming pure conservatives or pure liberals.

129
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.350
And you might kind of wonder, how is this a problem?

130
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:08.590
<v 2>Well,</v>

131
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.000
the problem comes when this ideological consistency translates into hate against

132
00:07:13.001 --> 00:07:15.130
the other tribe. In 1994,

133
00:07:15.131 --> 00:07:19.690
only 17% of Republicans saw Democrats as a threat to the country and only

134
00:07:19.691 --> 00:07:23.320
16% of Democrats, all Republicans as a threat by 2014,

135
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:27.160
these numbers had risen to 43% and 38% respectively.

136
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.020
And of course it's gotten Borst since then.

137
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.770
And as we'll see later on, this translates into real politics too.

138
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:40.270
Elected politicians are nothing but a reflection of the societies that vote for

139
00:07:40.271 --> 00:07:40.930
them. So.

140
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:41.890
<v 1>Okay. Okay.</v>

141
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.910
We can say that America is really getting much more polarized than before. Now.

142
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.410
The question is, where does this polarization come from? What has caused it?

143
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.850
Let's have a look at that right now.

144
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.250
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

145
00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:01.600
<v 1>Our history of polarization traces back to the end of the 1960s.</v>

146
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.600
These were the times of Nixon hippies and the Vietnam war.

147
00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:09.220
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

148
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.370
<v 1>You might believe that those years were especially turbulent for the American</v>

149
00:08:12.371 --> 00:08:14.890
media, but the opposite is actually true.

150
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:19.450
Back then almost all Americans got their news from the same sources for a better

151
00:08:19.451 --> 00:08:20.230
understanding.

152
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:24.820
95% of the TV news audience came from just three stations,

153
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.400
ABC, NBC and CBS.

154
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.370
We are talking about traditional more balanced media.

155
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.530
Those TVs aims to be nonpartisan,

156
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:35.980
and they gave voice to both sides of the spectrum because they wanted to capture

157
00:08:35.981 --> 00:08:40.600
as much of the market as they could. But everything changed in 1988.

158
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.290
<v 0>Good evening. I'm David Walker and I'm Lois Hart. Now here's the news.</v>

159
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:49.060
<v 2>So what happened in 1980? You guessed it. This was the year in which CNN,</v>

160
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:51.280
the cable news network was born.

161
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.760
CNN was the first TV channel offering news for 24.

162
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.200
And the format was an unprecedented success.

163
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.850
And during the eighties and nineties, more and more cable TV channels arose.

164
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.100
Of course not all of them were about news,

165
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:10.110
but the cable TV phenomenon kept growing and growing. And years later in 1996,

166
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.170
two other big news stations were born MSNBC,

167
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.960
liberal news outlet and Fox news, a conservative.

168
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:20.660
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

169
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:25.100
<v 2>All of a sudden viewers didn't have just three TV news options to choose from,</v>

170
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:29.510
but lots of them cable TV became the go-to way for Americans to get information

171
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.920
by the year 2006,

172
00:09:30.921 --> 00:09:34.640
58.4% of American households had cable TV.

173
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.190
And those legacy outlets such as ABC,

174
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.640
NBC or CBS were losing their share of the audience.

175
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:46.220
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

176
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.960
<v 1>This point? I know what some of you are thinking,</v>

177
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.950
what exactly is the problem here? The more competition we have on news,

178
00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:54.260
the better, the quality, right? Well, yeah,

179
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:59.240
that sort of makes sense until we think about it in terms of corporate strategy,

180
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.140
what is the best strategy to survive in a competitive market? Of course,

181
00:10:03.141 --> 00:10:07.310
the answer is specialization. We call it market segmentation.

182
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.530
You can see on this very platform, YouTube,

183
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.740
most of the channels who reach a big audience are those who specialize on a

184
00:10:12.741 --> 00:10:16.190
specific niche, science politics or video games,

185
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:20.240
but how can a news channel specialize? What niches can they try to appeal to?

186
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.810
Of course there are always channels focused on economics or sports,

187
00:10:23.811 --> 00:10:26.600
but for many, the answer was ideology.

188
00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:31.480
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

189
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:36.410
<v 1>The Fox news phenomenon. Fox news is the fifth biggest TV news show and America.</v>

190
00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.340
However, if you are a democratic voter chances, are you never watched them?

191
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:40.971
They're not.

192
00:10:40.971 --> 00:10:45.950
So secret formula is that they have become a go-to for conservatives 65%

193
00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.200
of the Republican voters watch Fox news.

194
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:52.700
And this translates and to millions of years, and as always happens,

195
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:56.330
whenever a company achieves success, the others follow suit today,

196
00:10:56.331 --> 00:10:58.130
the ideological news formula has been.

197
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:04.640
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

198
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.700
<v 1>Have you ever heard of the Huffington post? Have you haven't don't worry.</v>

199
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:11.690
And five, totally. 63% of the American public news about their existence.

200
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.390
Then again, they have a huge audience. Why?

201
00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:19.190
Because 81% of the self-proclaimed liberal Democrats will love them. So,

202
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:22.280
okay. I can see what you're thinking now. So what is the problem here?

203
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.690
This is a smart business strategy. Consumers are happy businesses make money.

204
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:31.010
Everyone's happy, right? But no. Think about it this way.

205
00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:34.970
If you are getting your news from Huffington post and only from Huffington post,

206
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.320
you are seeing a completely different reality from someone who watches only Fox

207
00:11:39.321 --> 00:11:43.460
news. It's late coming from different planets. Just have a loop.

208
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.113
<v 0>This</v>

209
00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.353
[inaudible] woman who lost.

210
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.070
<v 2>To COVID-19, his only condition.</v>

211
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.960
<v 3>Was trusting Donald Trump.</v>

212
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.860
<v 1>Of course, this headline is pretty exaggerated.</v>

213
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.210
I doubt this woman really believes that trusting Donald Trump makes you more

214
00:12:06.211 --> 00:12:11.100
likely to get COVID-19. But think about it. This is a piece from CNN news.

215
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.430
Then again, do you really think it was made to report total reality?

216
00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.450
Clearly not.

217
00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:19.500
The goal of this article is to confirm the reader's biases against Trump.

218
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.140
People who disliked Trump want to see that,

219
00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.980
but let's keep to this story for a moment because that woman became viral during

220
00:12:25.981 --> 00:12:26.814
the campaign.

221
00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.450
Apparently she wrote an obituary after her father's untimely death,

222
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.660
the became extremely popular on the internet days later,

223
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:37.170
she was called to participate at the national democratic convention.

224
00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.470
She had just become an anti Trump symbol,

225
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:44.250
and that is not by pure chance. Think about it this way.

226
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.780
Ideological media creates spaces for those who share the same values.

227
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.350
This creates more ideologically consistent voters.

228
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.020
And this is pure gold for political campaigners.

229
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.860
<v 4>Governor Michael Dukakis vetoed, mandatory sentences for drug dealers.</v>

230
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:04.110
He vetoed the death penalty is revolving door prison policy gave weekend

231
00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.350
fellows to first degree murder is not eligible for parole.

232
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.730
<v 1>You see one of the biggest myths when it comes to electoral campaigning is that</v>

233
00:13:11.731 --> 00:13:14.850
you want to appeal to the mainstream audience. In fact,

234
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:19.110
the right strategy has to appeal to different niches of the public to maximize

235
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.020
turnout. And according to the Pew research center,

236
00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:26.640
consistent liberals and conservatives are twice as likely to vote and

237
00:13:26.641 --> 00:13:29.010
donate money to campaigns. Also,

238
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:32.100
they tend to be much more influential in their own communities.

239
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.570
All of this means a golden opportunity when it comes to electoral campaigns.

240
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:44.520
<v 3>[Inaudible] politics. It's what you perceive to be true. That's true. Truth.</v>

241
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:45.600
Arthur Finkelstein.

242
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:48.930
<v 1>The man you just saw on your screen is Arthur Finkelstein.</v>

243
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:52.710
We could say this man alongside with Lee Atwater and Cole rule are the

244
00:13:52.711 --> 00:13:55.980
godfathers of the modern political strategy. During the eighties,

245
00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:59.490
these three men redefined the Republican strategy or their advice,

246
00:13:59.491 --> 00:14:02.310
political campaigns stop being based on the issues.

247
00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:06.210
I became a matter of ideology and identity. This says,

248
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.680
instead of defending a list of issues, they put the focus on specific policies.

249
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:15.300
One becomes Republican because he or she votes for a whole ideological and

250
00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.640
identity Syrian package. When they vote,

251
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.070
they're not choosing one policy over another,

252
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.230
but instead they are owning their own.

253
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.213
<v 3>We</v>

254
00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:29.550
[inaudible] now on anyone who belongs to the Republican party will automatically

255
00:14:29.551 --> 00:14:32.760
find himself in the same group as the opponents of abortion.

256
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:37.260
And anyone who supports abortion will automatically be labeled a Democrat Arthur

257
00:14:37.261 --> 00:14:38.094
Finkelstein.

258
00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.540
<v 1>This might surprise you,</v>

259
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.840
but this strategy was a success since the very beginning,

260
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:47.850
since the year 1995 through to 2007 Republicans dominated both

261
00:14:47.851 --> 00:14:50.790
the Senate and the house of representatives. And this is thanks to the,

262
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:56.060
that Finkelstein then Atwater. And finally Rueve created and here,

263
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.340
let me make a digression by no means.

264
00:14:58.341 --> 00:15:00.560
This is a critique to the political strategists,

265
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:04.550
a political strategist as a professional, whose job is to win elections,

266
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.490
not to win Nobel prizes. On this regard,

267
00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.910
the Republican campaigns of the nineties are a political classic.

268
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.700
If you're watching this video and you were planning to work in elections,

269
00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:17.990
you should really study their work. And this is exactly what the Democrats did.

270
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:22.940
Little by little identity politics has become the cornerstone of every election

271
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:27.440
on both sides of the debate. Not only in America, but everywhere.

272
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:31.070
And I know what you're going to say now, again, where is the problem here?

273
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.580
Candidates want to win elections that as democracy,

274
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:38.630
we like to debate about big ideas, not about small specific issues.

275
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:42.860
So pay attention now because you're about to see just how big this problem.

276
00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:49.720
<v 0>Six.</v>

277
00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.160
<v 1>Of disagreement at this point,</v>

278
00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:55.120
I can pretty much already imagine the comment section on this video, dude,

279
00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.240
do you know where you find consensus in North Korea?

280
00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.530
They just have one political party. So it's the end of all discussion and yeah,

281
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:05.500
you're right. Democracy is the celebration of disagreement.

282
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.830
It makes sense to have different parties with different ideas.

283
00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.070
This is what we have in a thing called parliamentary politics,

284
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:20.740
But let's not forget. The bells are passed after a consensus is reached.

285
00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:25.780
And in most cases, those laws are voted by politicians from different parties,

286
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:30.010
a bipartisan democracy as the American one is designed to be works so that we

287
00:16:30.011 --> 00:16:33.490
can have Republicans and Democrats getting to some kind of agreement.

288
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.860
Usually through compromise.

289
00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.710
<v 2>Strange as it sounds. This is Ben,</v>

290
00:16:38.711 --> 00:16:42.310
the common thread through most of the history of this country.

291
00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.670
Let's take an example. The 1964 civil rights act,

292
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.840
The law that banned racial segregation in the Southern United States.

293
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:57.040
And it passed with 70% support of the 70%. Yes,

294
00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:02.050
136 votes came to the Republican party and 153 came from the democratic

295
00:17:02.051 --> 00:17:03.940
party of the 30%, no votes.

296
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:08.620
91 were Democrats and 35 Republicans back then by partisan

297
00:17:08.621 --> 00:17:12.400
agreements were the norm, even in the 1980s, Ronald Reagan,

298
00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:16.390
a Republican president at a close personal friendship with tip O'Neill a

299
00:17:16.391 --> 00:17:19.210
democratic congressperson and the speaker of the house.

300
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:23.740
<v 0>Pardon.</v>

301
00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:27.100
<v 2>Led to many important bipartisan bills getting paid.</v>

302
00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:30.880
<v 1>And you might think, okay, but these are just some quaint stories.</v>

303
00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:35.200
Can we really say American legislative houses are more polarized now? Well,

304
00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.810
the truth is this can actually be measured easily.

305
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.290
Just have a look at this infographic video by business insider,

306
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.620
the blue balls represent a politician from the democratic party.

307
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:47.380
The red ones represent a Republican politician.

308
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:50.820
<v 0>Here.</v>

309
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:55.380
<v 1>You can see how Congress people voted between 1967 and 1969.</v>

310
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.890
You can see how many connections there are between the red and the blue dots.

311
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.280
All of these connections are those different votes where the Democrats and the

312
00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:06.540
Republicans reached a compromise during the 1970s in the 1980s,

313
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.630
we can see how the connections between these are kind of similar.

314
00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:12.360
Now let's fast forward to the two thousands.

315
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:16.530
You can see how there are less and less connections between red and blue dots.

316
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:21.480
By the 2011 to 2013 Congress only a few blue dots are interacting

317
00:18:21.481 --> 00:18:25.140
with the red ones. And there are thousands of examples that reflect this wedge.

318
00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:29.190
For example, in 2010, the Senate approved the affordable care act.

319
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.030
What the media coined as about.

320
00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:37.130
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

321
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:41.720
<v 1>This law was passed with 51% of support from this 51%,</v>

322
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.600
219 votes came from the democratic party.

323
00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:49.460
And none came from the Republicans. Yeah, that's right. None.

324
00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:54.110
Unlike the civil rights act, this law came without any conservative support.

325
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:55.970
This law has two problems.

326
00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.480
The first one is that we are talking about a law that came out with very little

327
00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.860
that made conservatives happy and they fight it to this day. But not only that,

328
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.140
having a Congress and the Senate so divided,

329
00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.110
it is harder and harder to pass a budget.

330
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.260
And that explains news like this.

331
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:19.820
<v 3>Longest government shutdown in history ends after Trump relents on wall.</v>

332
00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:21.530
<v 1>On previous visual politic videos,</v>

333
00:19:21.531 --> 00:19:24.800
we've already explained what a government shutdown is all about.

334
00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.480
This is what happens in America.

335
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:30.440
When the two houses cannot reach a compromise to pass the budget.

336
00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.190
And that moment the government cannot pay the civil sevens as employees.

337
00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.820
And it has to furlough them the longest government shutdown that happened during

338
00:19:37.821 --> 00:19:42.350
the Trump administration and the year 2019, it was 35 days.

339
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.520
There's an 18, there was another one, but lasted only three days.

340
00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:53.210
But this is not just something that happened to Donald Trump during the Obama

341
00:19:53.211 --> 00:19:58.100
administration in 2013, another government shut down, but lasted 16 days.

342
00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:06.680
You have to go back to 1996 to find another case similar to this and this

343
00:20:06.681 --> 00:20:07.100
case,

344
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:11.240
we will be talking about a 21 day shutdown during the Clinton administration.

345
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.820
So as you can see, there is a trend here.

346
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.850
Shutdowns are starting to become more common.

347
00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.610
And this trend is a very expensive one.

348
00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:23.660
The last shutdown costs $5 billion to the American treasury.

349
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.750
And that is not the worst consequence of political polarization.

350
00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.570
The worst consequence is news like this.

351
00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:33.560
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

352
00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:38.240
<v 3>George Floyd protests man killed in Detroit as demonstrations,</v>

353
00:20:38.241 --> 00:20:40.070
rage across us,

354
00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:47.060
Antifa protestor implicated in killing of Trump supporter in

355
00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.600
[inaudible] surgeons of the U S paramilitary rights.

356
00:20:59.050 --> 00:20:59.790
[inaudible].

357
00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:02.280
<v 1>So now the question goes over to you.</v>

358
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.460
Do you think your country is getting more polarized over time?

359
00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:10.050
What can online media outlets like this one do in order to combat that?

360
00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.640
And what does this mean for the future?
