1
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.150
<v 1>We are in the middle of a pandemic and no,</v>

2
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.370
I'm not talking about SARS coronavirus too.

3
00:00:13.371 --> 00:00:17.060
But the one that has been with us for four decades and has killed more than 30

4
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.270
million people around the world. Exactly. I'm talking about HIV,

5
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.790
the human immunodeficiency virus pandemic.

6
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.860
This name may not tell you at all much, but I'm sure you will know the disease.

7
00:00:30.861 --> 00:00:32.960
It causes AIDS. Fortunately,

8
00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:36.710
what used to be a death sentence is now a disease that can be managed.

9
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.780
Although there is no vaccine for HIV.

10
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.710
There are drugs that suppress the virus to an almost undetectable degree today,

11
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.410
more than half of eight patients are using these treatments,

12
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.870
which have zero cost to the patient. In many countries,

13
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.930
all of this is due to a number of policies that we are going to tell you about

14
00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:55.910
later, but make no mistake. This pandemic is not over yet in 2019 alone,

15
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.930
more than 690,000 people died of AIDS. Just to give you an idea.

16
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.700
Countries in South Africa currently have one in five adults infected with HIV.

17
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.740
However, this year 2020 as the whole world trembles with SARS coronavirus too,

18
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.140
there is very good news about the older pandemic.

19
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.910
Listen up second patient cured of HIV. Say doctors. Exactly.

20
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.790
At least we can say that. Not only can you live with AIDS,

21
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.330
but you can even completely eradicate it from your body. And so today,

22
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.860
which is world AIDS day,

23
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.500
we are going to tell you about the other side of this disease,

24
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.550
the political side,

25
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.330
that is why politics also play a role in the fight against HIV.

26
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.030
<v 0>How.</v>

27
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.410
<v 1>Is this other pandemic being fought? Why despite having infected so many people,</v>

28
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.310
have we never heard of quarantine or containment measures to prevent the spread

29
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.830
today, we're going to answer these questions. But first,

30
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.970
first we have a moral obligation to give you some very important information

31
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.150
about AIDS information that will help you understand this video,

32
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:55.700
but also for your daily life. So pay attention.

33
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.820
I think we need to know about AIDS is that it stands for acquired immune

34
00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:11.960
deficiency syndrome. In other words, AIDS doesn't really kill by itself.

35
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.910
AIDS attacks your immune system.

36
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.450
So you can die from simple pneumonia because your body has no defenses.

37
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.590
As we've Corona virus.

38
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.070
There are people that have the HIV virus and are asymptomatic.

39
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.730
There are even people with the virus who never develop symptoms of AIDS.

40
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.820
And how was HIV transmitted?

41
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.880
We are talking about an infection that is commonly known as a sexually

42
00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:35.240
transmitted disease because having unprotected sex is the main method of

43
00:02:35.241 --> 00:02:38.840
transmission. In addition to the exchange of other human fluids, such as blood,

44
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.870
this means that we can live with someone who has it, shake hands with them,

45
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.733
or even hug them.

46
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.130
But we cannot accept blood transfusions from this person or have unprotected

47
00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:48.620
sex. That's why it's so important to remember,

48
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:50.900
to use a condom in all your relationships.

49
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.870
And if one day you want to stop using them with your partner, take a test.

50
00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:57.500
First. This is not something people talk about, but in almost every country,

51
00:02:57.501 --> 00:02:59.440
there are centers where they do free tasks.

52
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:01.410
<v 0>If you don't want to.</v>

53
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.930
<v 1>Go to the center, you can also buy your test at the pharmacy.</v>

54
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.230
The price depends on the country, but they are usually around $30.

55
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.030
They are fast and easy to use.

56
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:11.160
<v 0>But if you test.</v>

57
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.850
<v 1>Positive, don't panic, HIV tests do not give false negatives,</v>

58
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.420
but they can give false positives. That is if you test negative for HIV,

59
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.880
you can relax. However, if you test positive,

60
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.450
you should go to the doctor and have another test done to verify whether or not

61
00:03:24.451 --> 00:03:25.470
you have HIV.

62
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.380
Having said that we are now going to look back at a little bit of history.

63
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.650
<v 0>[Inaudible] the invisible killer.</v>

64
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.280
<v 1>1981,</v>

65
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.480
the American center for disease control identified the first cases of HIV.

66
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.901
However,

67
00:03:45.901 --> 00:03:49.200
the virus had been present for decades in the United States and around the

68
00:03:49.201 --> 00:03:49.650
world.

69
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.880
Our story dates back to the early 20th century in what was known then as German

70
00:03:53.881 --> 00:03:54.714
Cameroon,

71
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.460
HIV is a mutation of another virus found in certain types of monkeys called SIV

72
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.800
or Simian immunodeficiency virus.

73
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.290
And you'll say if it really started so long ago,

74
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.010
how is it possible that no cases were detected until almost 80 years later?

75
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.090
<v 0>Well.</v>

76
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.690
<v 1>Truth is that HIV is not a virus that is transmitted through the respiratory</v>

77
00:04:15.691 --> 00:04:18.930
tract, like the Corona virus. In other words, at first,

78
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.610
the transmission was much slower.

79
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.600
The first outbreaks began in 1920 in what was then the Belgian Congo.

80
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.880
And it is believed that in the 1960s,

81
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.100
the first cases arrived in the United States.

82
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.053
<v 0>The first carrier.</v>

83
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.020
<v 1>Where the Haitians who returns to the American continent by 1978,</v>

84
00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.430
it is estimated that 5% of the population of San Francisco and New York was

85
00:04:41.431 --> 00:04:44.220
already HIV positive. However, at that time,

86
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.560
no one knew that a virus has such existed.

87
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.410
Doctors didn't understand what they were really dealing with. In fact,

88
00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:53.790
it was not until 1981 that the us center for disease control identified this.

89
00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:54.803
<v 0>Virus.</v>

90
00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.130
At first.

91
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.610
<v 1>It was called the four H disease because it affected mostly Haitians,</v>

92
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.170
homosexuals, haemophiliacs, and heroin addicts. However, since 1982,

93
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.180
we have been calling it by the name of the disease.

94
00:05:09.181 --> 00:05:14.010
It causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome or AIDS back in the eighties,

95
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.670
being diagnosed with AIDS was a death sentence. For all intents and purposes,

96
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.390
the sick had a maximum life expectancy of one year after being diagnosed,

97
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.590
the treatments were very primitive or to bluntly non-existent. Meanwhile,

98
00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:29.460
the virus kept on spreading to give you an idea in February, 1983,

99
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.030
United States registered the first 1000 reported cases.

100
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.100
But at the end of that same year, there were more than three.

101
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.593
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

102
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.790
<v 1>Years later, the cases were close to a million. Just to give you an idea.</v>

103
00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:43.140
In 1995 alone,

104
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.890
almost 100,000 people died from this disease in the United States.

105
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.010
This was the time when AIDS was all in the media. In fact,

106
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.660
it was in 1993 when the film Philadelphia with Tom Hanks and Antonio

107
00:05:54.661 --> 00:05:56.160
Banderas was released,

108
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.900
which served to raise awareness of this pandemic in the entire West. However,

109
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.330
all these numbers pale in comparison to those in Africa.

110
00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.243
<v 0>Okay.</v>

111
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.610
<v 1>We are living in a dystopia in 2020 with the Corona virus.</v>

112
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:16.270
The havoc that AIDS has caused in Africa is straight out of horror movie.

113
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.100
And this region AIDS is responsible for a 10 year drop in life expectancy

114
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.390
in 1995,

115
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.560
average life expectancy in a country like South Africa was 63 years by

116
00:06:26.561 --> 00:06:27.520
2005,

117
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.750
the figure had dropped her 53 years and other countries like Botswana reached

118
00:06:31.751 --> 00:06:36.220
infection rates of 25%. Think about what this means. In 2000,

119
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.370
when the pandemic reached its peak in Botswana, one in four,

120
00:06:39.371 --> 00:06:41.170
people had HIV by this time,

121
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.950
more than 60% of the deaths in this country were directly related to eights.

122
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.310
And the numbers reflect similar stories in every country in the region.

123
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.290
Remember that being very poor countries,

124
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.930
they could hardly afford the treatments that were already available in the

125
00:06:52.931 --> 00:06:57.010
United States. So it was virtually impossible to survive HIV,

126
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.330
but enough about numbers.

127
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.870
The question you may be pondering now is how have different governments acted to

128
00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:05.770
stop this pandemic? What policies are being implemented? Well right now,

129
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.760
we're going to go take a look.

130
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.400
<v 0>[Inaudible] deadly policies.</v>

131
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.840
<v 1>I know what many of you are wondering by now,</v>

132
00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:23.740
why have we never heard of any confinement measures to flatten the aides curve

133
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.300
with the figures that we have just given you,

134
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.200
it seems more than reasonable that drastic political measures be taken at least

135
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.740
equal to those being taken with the Corona virus, right? Well, yes.

136
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.090
And at the same time, no,

137
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.390
there is a very important difference between Corona virus and HIV.

138
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.310
And it lies in the manner of transmission.

139
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.280
Corona virus is transmitted through the respiratory tract.

140
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.030
This means that you only have to be near an infected person to be infected.

141
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:50.020
In the case of HIV, it is only transmitted by sexual or fluid contact,

142
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.090
mainly blood. In other words, in theory,

143
00:07:52.091 --> 00:07:56.170
it is possible to reduce infections without having to confine an entire country.

144
00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.670
This does not mean however that governments do not have a responsibility to try

145
00:08:00.671 --> 00:08:04.420
and stop the pandemic. Keep in mind that there is no vaccine for AIDS.

146
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:08.080
So public policy is crucial to prevent contagion and believe me,

147
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.860
if SARS coronavirus two has highlighted how negligent many governments can be.

148
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.980
HOV showed us the same thing even before 2020.

149
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.130
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

150
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.770
<v 1>And if there is one country where the government has failed,</v>

151
00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:22.660
absolutely it is South Africa.

152
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.780
We are talking about the richest country in Sub-Saharan Africa.

153
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.990
Of course they don't have the living standards of the United States or any

154
00:08:28.991 --> 00:08:32.020
European country, but in the 1990s, South Africa,

155
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.360
they had good hospitals to put it in perspective.

156
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:38.020
This is the country where the first ever heart transplant was performed.

157
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:41.440
In other words, it was a country that had the resources to control the pandemic.

158
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.240
The problem was the government.

159
00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:48.220
<v 2>Does HIV cause AIDS can a virus cause a syndrome.</v>

160
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:53.170
How it can't because a syndrome is a group of diseases resulting from

161
00:08:53.171 --> 00:08:54.940
acquired immune deficiency,

162
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.860
Tabo Becky president of South Africa from 1999 to two.

163
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.140
<v 1>2008. That's right.</v>

164
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.680
While South Africa was battling the worst phases of the pandemic it's president

165
00:09:03.681 --> 00:09:06.830
denied that there was a connection between the virus and the disease.

166
00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.490
The health ministry recommended things like garlic or beets to fight AIDS.

167
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.900
By that time, the first antiretroviral drugs to treat AIDS had been released.

168
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:18.590
This explains why death rates were already falling in the United States and

169
00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:22.010
Europe. However, in South Africa, many hospitals refuse to supply them.

170
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.570
And I know what many of you were thinking, well,

171
00:09:23.571 --> 00:09:26.930
they refusing to administer them or did they simply not have the money to pay

172
00:09:26.931 --> 00:09:28.040
for them? As you can imagine,

173
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:31.940
these early antiretroviral drugs were expensive in 1999.

174
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:36.050
Treatment costs about $800 per patient per month. And yes, you were right.

175
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.240
Money was an important factor, but surprisingly,

176
00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.480
the main reason why these drugs were not provided was that the authorities did

177
00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:42.470
not want them to be given.

178
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:46.880
We had to wait until 2002 for the South African constitutional coach to take.

179
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.100
<v 0>Action in South Africa.</v>

180
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:52.760
<v 2>In government forced to give mothers antiretroviral drug.</v>

181
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:56.240
The fight has raged for close to a year in different courts with the government

182
00:09:56.241 --> 00:09:57.590
losing at every stage.

183
00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.160
But fighting on the government has contested that the drug safety has not been

184
00:10:01.161 --> 00:10:01.700
proven,

185
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.510
although it's provided no evidence to back up its claim and maintain that the

186
00:10:05.511 --> 00:10:07.760
courts should have no role in the creation of.

187
00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:11.210
<v 0>That's right?</v>

188
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.330
<v 1>The South African government did not want to give drugs to prevent mothers with</v>

189
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.840
AIDS from passing it onto their children. So what about preventative measures?

190
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.710
As we have already said, a key measure to prevent HIV infection is condoms.

191
00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.160
Remember we're talking about the disease that is mainly transmitted sexually.

192
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.310
It makes sense. Doesn't it? Well far from promoting the use of condoms,

193
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.640
many South African institutions did exactly the opposite.

194
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:32.683
<v 0>Take a look.</v>

195
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:36.950
<v 2>African Catholic church condemns condom use to prevent HIV.</v>

196
00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.590
<v 1>And we are not only talking about the church.</v>

197
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.960
Do you remember the 2010 world cup?

198
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.600
The one where Spain one I made the VU is Ella trendy.

199
00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.850
Well pay attention world cup.

200
00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:51.740
<v 2>2010, FIFA blocking condom distribution at venues say AIDS groups.</v>

201
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.600
<v 1>In 2010, 45% of all deaths in South Africa were okay.</v>

202
00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.673
<v 0>It's related.</v>

203
00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.380
<v 1>Even today. Age is a major problem in this country. However, juices,</v>

204
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.060
there are many cases like South Africa.

205
00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:08.240
There are also countries that have been able to implement effective AIDS

206
00:11:08.241 --> 00:11:10.670
policies. That is the case in the United Kingdom.

207
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:20.383
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

208
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:27.890
<v 1>Early years of the pandemic United Kingdom realized that HIV is transmitted</v>

209
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.700
primarily through two routes, unprotected sex and sharing needles.

210
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:35.840
Remember that heroin use was rampant in the 1980s and the 1990s,

211
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.060
millions of people were hooked on this drug,

212
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.940
which is one of the most dangerous in existence. And as you know,

213
00:11:40.941 --> 00:11:44.210
heroin is mainly consumed intravenously, many heroin addict,

214
00:11:44.211 --> 00:11:45.590
shared needles to shoot up.

215
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:48.860
So the UK was one of the first countries to come up with programs,

216
00:11:48.861 --> 00:11:52.970
to offer new syringes to addicts. In addition, they pioneered sex education,

217
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.710
the government funded all kinds of advertising campaigns to get the British,

218
00:11:56.711 --> 00:11:57.544
to use condoms.

219
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:02.170
Thanks to this effort in 2010 only 0.5% of deaths in this country were related

220
00:12:02.171 --> 00:12:06.100
to AIDS compared to 45% in South Africa. As you can see,

221
00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.430
fighting a pandemic is not only a matter of medical technology,

222
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:13.000
but also of good policy. However, don't despair. At the beginning of this video,

223
00:12:13.001 --> 00:12:16.540
we told you that there is good news about eight, my dear friends,

224
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.210
our visual politic. Now it comes to the feel-good part of the video.

225
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.363
<v 0>Stay tuned.</v>

226
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.210
[inaudible] a light at the end of the pandemic.

227
00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.630
<v 1>Trees most effected by AIDS is Botswana at the peak of this pandemic.</v>

228
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.960
Nearly 60% of the country's deaths were age related. However,

229
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.060
the numbers have now dropped to 28%.

230
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.470
And the best news is that Botswana is not an isolated case. In 2000,

231
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.740
there were 3 million new infections each year, world wide.

232
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:50.640
That number is now below 2 million. And this decline is led by the region.

233
00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.010
Most effected Sub-Saharan Africa,

234
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:56.730
new infections dropped by 30% from 2010 to 2018.

235
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:59.970
And what is the reason for this improvement? Well, to a large extent,

236
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.870
we have to thank international organizations, such as the United nations.

237
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.000
We couldn't criticize the UN for many things,

238
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:08.490
but we also have to recognize when they get it right.

239
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:09.900
And in the fight against AIDS,

240
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:13.920
they have played a key role along with another organization called the global

241
00:13:13.921 --> 00:13:14.870
fund and the United.

242
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:19.770
<v 0>Specific.</v>

243
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.300
<v 1>Basically it was George Bush Jr.</v>

244
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.030
Who founded the president's emergency plan for AIDS relief,

245
00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.840
Bush commissioned Anthony Fowchee to design a plan that would really turn the

246
00:13:27.841 --> 00:13:30.750
situation around no matter what it took. And yes,

247
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.530
we're talking about the very same fellow Richie who now advises the white house

248
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.360
in the fight against the Corona virus.

249
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.300
Since the creation of this AIDS plan known by its acronym.

250
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.860
PEPFAR Washington has spent more than 90 billion USD on all kinds of

251
00:13:43.861 --> 00:13:44.580
campaigns.

252
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.210
It is estimated that this plan alone has saved more than 13 million lives.

253
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.940
And this explains why. According to several surveys,

254
00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.960
George Bush is the most popular us president in Sub-Saharan Africa,

255
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:59.340
surpassing others like Barack Obama or bill Clinton since then very effective

256
00:13:59.341 --> 00:14:03.270
and above all very pragmatic professional campaigns have been launched that is

257
00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.680
without ideology, without religion and with measurable objectives. For example,

258
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:10.500
we talked to a consultant who worked on one of these campaigns,

259
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:15.330
specifically her job was to get all sex workers in Angola to use condoms.

260
00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:19.170
As I said, religion and ideology was left for another day. For this purpose,

261
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.140
she designed a network of centers in all villages of the country,

262
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.240
where they gave free condoms to the prostitutes.

263
00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:27.870
They made it possible to go to any of these places and pick up a box. However,

264
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.110
the plan did not work. Most of the sex workers did not want to use condoms.

265
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:35.490
So what did this consultant do? Well, and market study after several interviews,

266
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:39.390
she discovered that sex workers did not use condoms because they smelled bad

267
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.880
solution. They started handing out flavored condoms.

268
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.430
They even did a study to see which flavors were the most popular.

269
00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:45.323
A few months later,

270
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.500
more than 86% of the sex workers were using protection with policies like this

271
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:53.330
and go that has been bending the curve of HIV infection since 2011.

272
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.470
And this is just one example of the many programs that have come out from drug

273
00:14:57.471 --> 00:14:59.390
delivery programs to sex education,

274
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.300
all of them with clear and measurable objectives and they follow up.

275
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:08.620
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

276
00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.870
<v 1>Thanks to these programs. By the year 2018,</v>

277
00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:15.310
53% of AIDS patients worldwide were able to live with the disease and not

278
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.670
transmit it. And although the timeline has had to be pushed back a little,

279
00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:20.920
it is now estimated that by 2030,

280
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:24.250
the magic figure of 90 1990 could be reached.

281
00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:28.180
That is 90% of those infected will be aware that they are carriers.

282
00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:30.910
90% of these infected will have treatments.

283
00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:35.290
And 90% of this loss group can live with the virus without infecting others.

284
00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:39.130
<v 0>That's not the.</v>

285
00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:42.460
<v 1>End of the story because as AIDS policies have improved over time.</v>

286
00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.320
So have treatments. In fact,

287
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:47.560
it is in this aspect of the story that the United States has played a very

288
00:15:47.561 --> 00:15:51.160
important role. The us government has not only coordinated many plans,

289
00:15:51.161 --> 00:15:52.990
like the ones we've outlined. In addition,

290
00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.200
the United States pays for almost half of the treatment in Africa today,

291
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:59.110
antiretroviral treatment can cost about $9 a month.

292
00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:03.010
And in many countries like Angola, it is even available at zero cost.

293
00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.190
And this is due to funding from the United States and other countries.

294
00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:06.821
And finally,

295
00:16:06.821 --> 00:16:10.810
we have the pharmaceutical factor treatments research has reached such a point.

296
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:15.820
We can finally see news headlines like this second patient cured of HIV,

297
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:20.650
say doctors, BBC, March, 2020. This new story is from the year 2020,

298
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.790
but the first time in history,

299
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:24.700
two eight patients have been cured of the disease. Of course,

300
00:16:24.701 --> 00:16:26.140
this news has many aspects.

301
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.560
These two cases have been very specific and were treated in very special

302
00:16:29.561 --> 00:16:31.390
circumstances. If you want more details,

303
00:16:31.391 --> 00:16:32.830
you can follow the links in the description.

304
00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.940
But the important thing about this news is that we can now say AIDS is no longer

305
00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.360
an incurable disease. However, it's not all good news.

306
00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:44.140
Whilst almost all countries are reducing their infection rates and above all

307
00:16:44.141 --> 00:16:47.590
their mortality rates. There is one country that is breaking the trend. Russia.

308
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.250
<v 0>Interestingly.</v>

309
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:57.400
<v 1>Russia initially seemed to be a country immune to the pandemic. However,</v>

310
00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:01.540
since the mid 2000, the numbers have skyrocketed by 2017,

311
00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:06.220
1.3% of adults aged 15 to 49 were infected and mortality rates have

312
00:17:06.221 --> 00:17:10.150
skyrocketed too. So what is the cause for all this? The answer is once again,

313
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.530
in politics to date,

314
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:15.040
the policies that have worked best are those of the United Kingdom that is

315
00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:18.850
education campaigns, clean syringe distribution, and condom distribution.

316
00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.100
And it is just the opposite of what they're currently doing.

317
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.820
<v 0>In Russia. To give you an idea.</v>

318
00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:28.990
<v 1>Since 2014, Russia has laws that condemn so-called gay propaganda,</v>

319
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:33.490
this gay propaganda would include all campaigns to promote safe, homosexual sex.

320
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.680
The same goes for any kind of sex education,

321
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:38.590
which is interpreted as the pernicious influence of the West.

322
00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.050
And let's not talk about the distribution of syringes,

323
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.450
which is understood to be a way of promoting drug addiction.

324
00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:47.650
So what seemed to be a region immune to the virus is beginning to have serious

325
00:17:47.651 --> 00:17:49.980
problems. But now the question is over to you.
