Now let's get into the video.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.253
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

24
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.370
<v 1>It is said that there are two challenges you should never enter into with a</v>

25
00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:32.270
Swiss national.

26
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.340
<v 0>And the other is money</v>

27
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.660
despite.

28
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.190
<v 1>Having just over 8.5 million inhabitants and being nested amongst tranquil</v>

29
00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:43.730
mountains.

30
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.440
The Swiss Confederation with the GDP of over $700 billion has become not only

31
00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.150
one of the richest countries in the world,

32
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.850
but also a safe Haven for the planets. Grateful. Yeah,

33
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.910
And I'm not just talking about money banks and financial investments.

34
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.950
It goes a lot further than that. For example,

35
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.610
Switzerland is also home to the largest art deposit in the world.

36
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.780
We are talking about a country where we can even find initiatives such as the

37
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.900
Brunick mega safe,

38
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.030
a project that involves drilling into the Alps to build huge secure volts where

39
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.100
all kinds of valuable objects can be stored.

40
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.220
But hold on in this video,

41
00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:24.440
we are not going to focus so much on the Swiss economy,

42
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:28.430
but rather on a very odd institution that in recent years has become an

43
00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:31.100
important player in the global financial market.

44
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.790
I'm referring to the Swiss national bank. Yes, that's right.

45
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.900
The central bank of Switzerland, a central bank.

46
00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:45.800
So unusual that it's even listed on the stock exchange. Yes, yes,

47
00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:49.340
that's correct. It is quoted as one more stock on the Swiss stock exchange.

48
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.851
In other words,

49
00:02:49.851 --> 00:02:53.090
you could personally invest in the Swiss national bank and become a shareholder

50
00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:56.390
of the central bank of Switzerland curious don't you think?

51
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.100
<v 0>But that is by.</v>

52
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.200
<v 1>No means it's only peculiarity.</v>

53
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.490
Did you know that the Swiss central bank has invested more than $170 billion in

54
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:08.980
shares of companies such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook,

55
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.360
or alphabet among many others?

56
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.420
<v 0>Did you know that there are even.</v>

57
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.620
<v 1>Analysts and professionals who consider that the Swiss central bank has become</v>

58
00:03:19.621 --> 00:03:23.310
one of the largest hedge funds in the world and this new video that we have made

59
00:03:23.311 --> 00:03:26.310
in collaboration with value school, we are going to give you all the details.

60
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.880
So let's get going a different kind of bank.

61
00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.630
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

62
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.990
<v 1>Friends of visual politics. Please pay attention to the following headlines.</v>

63
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.160
<v 2>Second 2020 Swiss national bank posts,</v>

64
00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:46.050
$50 billion profit on boost from Apple and Amazon and company windfall makes

65
00:03:46.051 --> 00:03:50.460
Swiss central bank. One of the world's most successful investors in 2019

66
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.740
May 11th, 20,

67
00:03:52.741 --> 00:03:57.510
20 Switzerland central bank bought up Apple GE and Disney stock.

68
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.060
It also loaded up on a marijuana stock.

69
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.120
<v 1>Yes, I know it seems like news from a mutual fund or a hedge fund,</v>

70
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.180
but we're talking about the Swiss central bank, an institution,

71
00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:13.440
which like the European central bank and the Eurozone or the fed in the United

72
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.860
States has the main role of setting the monetary policy issuing the national

73
00:04:16.861 --> 00:04:19.890
currency. In this case, this was Frank and managing the countries.

74
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.630
<v 0>That is.</v>

75
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.780
<v 1>Usual task of central banks. However, as you can probably imagine,</v>

76
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.680
the Swiss national bank has certain characteristics that make it quite different

77
00:04:31.681 --> 00:04:33.450
from other central banks. First of all,

78
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.200
it is a bank that does not belong to the state and who share price is quoted on

79
00:04:37.201 --> 00:04:41.040
the stock exchange. And that, how can I put it is far from usual.

80
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.270
A closer look shows us that the capital of this bank is made up of a hundred

81
00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:49.200
thousand shares.

82
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.310
45% are held by the different cantons that make up this whisk Confederation.

83
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.470
<v 0>Just.</v>

84
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.190
<v 1>A side note,</v>

85
00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.090
the cantons are kind of autonomous regions with a lot of self-government.

86
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.450
They set their own taxes that rules their regulations in practice.

87
00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:06.960
They are almost small States that together form a kind of union,

88
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.310
the Swiss Confederation.

89
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.410
<v 0>But.</v>

90
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.300
<v 1>Let's continue. So the various cantons share 45% of the central bank shares.</v>

91
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.830
A further 15% is held by smaller local banks that also belong to the cantons

92
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.920
leaving the remaining 40% of float on the stock exchange.

93
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.340
In fact, the bank has been listed on the Swiss stock exchange since 1907.

94
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.810
So yes, without any problem,

95
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.360
you could become a shareholder of the Swiss central bank.

96
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.840
You can buy its shares just like you would buy those of any other company.

97
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.240
However, these stocks are a bit unusual.

98
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.600
Let's just say that the rights of shareholders are somewhat limited.

99
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.630
<v 0>You see.</v>

100
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.290
<v 1>Ordinary shares of the Swiss national bank do not have voting rights in the</v>

101
00:05:49.291 --> 00:05:50.850
event of the banks liquidation,

102
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.420
the shareholders would only receive at most the nominal amount at which the

103
00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:58.820
shares were issued 250 Swiss francs per, and what's more by law.

104
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.260
The shares can only pay a maximum dividend of 6% on the share capital,

105
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.440
which is 25 million Swiss francs. In other words,

106
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.180
shareholders can at best only receive 15 francs per share in dividends per

107
00:06:11.181 --> 00:06:15.650
year. And so if we consider that the shares are currently quoted at 5,300 Swiss

108
00:06:15.651 --> 00:06:19.010
francs, each that means that the dividend yield that shareholders receive,

109
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.821
which by the way,

110
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:23.120
is practically the only return they can get from this bank because the

111
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:27.050
accumulation of profits does not belong to them is 0.28% per year.

112
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.750
<v 0>Yes.</v>

113
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.420
<v 1>Yes, 0.28% per year.</v>

114
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.330
It certainly doesn't seem like the best investment in the world.

115
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.290
These shares behave more like a kind of very secure perpetual bond.

116
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.650
That is why the market value of this bank is only about

117
00:06:42.651 --> 00:06:45.560
$600 million. But hold on a second.

118
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.250
Didn't we tell you at the beginning that this bank made a profit of $50 billion

119
00:06:49.251 --> 00:06:50.120
in 2019.

120
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.850
<v 0>Was all this money go accordingly.</v>

121
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.260
<v 1>To the national bank act,</v>

122
00:06:56.261 --> 00:06:58.600
which is the law that regulates the operation of this body.

123
00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.120
These profits are accumulated in the bank's reserves,

124
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:05.200
which are gradually released both to the cantons and the federal budget itself.

125
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.610
90 20, for example,

126
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.030
the Kansans will receive 2 billion Swiss francs from the central bank and the

127
00:07:13.031 --> 00:07:17.260
federal council that is the federal government will receive a fervor, 1 billion,

128
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.800
all in all, some $3.3 billion. And in other words,

129
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.000
in the case of the Swiss national bank business is not done by the shareholders,

130
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.180
but then what's the point why dedicate a whole video to the workings of this

131
00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:29.290
bank, where all my friends,

132
00:07:29.291 --> 00:07:33.460
because the Swiss national bank has another very special feature that has a lot

133
00:07:33.461 --> 00:07:36.460
to do with the strength of the Swiss Franc and the country's economy.

134
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.260
So what is it? Let's take a look.

135
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.650
<v 0>Everyone wants Swiss francs.</v>

136
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.070
<v 1>Swiss Franc is a very special currency, although it is a fiduciary currency,</v>

137
00:07:48.071 --> 00:07:49.600
virtually everyone trusts it.

138
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:54.100
This explains why this currency plays a very significant role in world finance.

139
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.580
Let's just say that every time there is an economic crisis or an international

140
00:07:57.581 --> 00:08:01.570
financial crisis, the Swiss Franc becomes one of the most sought after havens.

141
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.180
When there are problems or trouble brewing,

142
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.960
everyone wants to have their money in Swiss francs in a way at the currency

143
00:08:10.961 --> 00:08:15.730
level, it plays the same role as gold. For example,

144
00:08:15.731 --> 00:08:19.540
after the financial crisis of 2008 demand for Swiss Frank sword,

145
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.000
this has also been the case with the coronavirus crisis.

146
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:28.000
And the question is why does the Swiss Franc play this role as an active refuge?

147
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:31.570
Why do investors feel more secure putting their fortunes into Swiss francs in

148
00:08:31.571 --> 00:08:33.370
times of fear or stress? Well,

149
00:08:33.371 --> 00:08:36.850
let's say that there are two explanations for this on the one hand,

150
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.580
the strength of the Swiss economy, which we'll talk about later.

151
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.700
And on the other hand, the historical performance of this currency

152
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.610
over the last five decades,

153
00:08:45.611 --> 00:08:48.820
the Swiss Franc has almost doubled in value against the dollar and even more

154
00:08:48.821 --> 00:08:52.600
against other major currencies, such as the Euro pound. And Ian, for example,

155
00:08:52.601 --> 00:08:55.440
in August, 2000, the market was giving one eight,

156
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.890
three Swiss francs for every us dollar. At the time of making this video,

157
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.610
you would only get 0.9 francs for every dollar that's less than half.

158
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.170
Of course there is one problem with so much demand for the Swiss Franc.

159
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:12.590
If the currency appreciation is very rapid or abrupt,

160
00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.010
the export industry may have problems and friends, believe it or not.

161
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.090
Switzerland is one of the countries with the most exports on the whole planet

162
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:24.920
each year, Switzerland exports, goods and services worth more than $400 billion.

163
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.890
I figure that accounts for more than 65% of its GDP,

164
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.700
which makes Switzerland a much bigger exporter than for example, Germany.

165
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.900
So what is the Swiss national bank doing to avoid very sharp reevaluations of

166
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:39.920
the Swiss Franc? Well,

167
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:43.610
to start with it tries to curb demand by setting the lowest interest rate in the

168
00:09:43.611 --> 00:09:48.470
world. The official interest rate in Switzerland is negative 0.75%.

169
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:52.010
And since that is not enough, and people still want to buy more and more Franks.

170
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.330
Then its second measure is to expand the supply that is to issue many,

171
00:09:56.331 --> 00:09:58.850
many new francs pay attention to this fact,

172
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.330
let's break it down since 2002,

173
00:10:02.331 --> 00:10:05.870
the balance sheet of the Swiss central bank has increased almost eight fold.

174
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.470
In other words,

175
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.290
the central bank has increased the number of Swiss francs by hundreds and

176
00:10:09.291 --> 00:10:12.110
hundreds of billions of dollars by the equivalent of just over

177
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:15.110
$850 billion. And in fact,

178
00:10:15.111 --> 00:10:19.700
this explains why today its balance sheet is equivalent to 135% of the

179
00:10:19.701 --> 00:10:22.790
country's GDP. This makes it in relative terms,

180
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.000
the central bank with the largest balance sheet in the world.

181
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:28.280
<v 0>And.</v>

182
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.740
<v 1>Here friends is where we come to the key issue.</v>

183
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.250
As we have seen the Swiss national bank is issuing new Franks to meet the huge

184
00:10:34.251 --> 00:10:35.001
demand. That is,

185
00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:38.660
it creates huge amounts of new Franks to be sold to investors in exchange for

186
00:10:38.661 --> 00:10:42.080
dollars, euros, pounds, yen, et cetera, et cetera. And the question,

187
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:46.370
the big question is what on earth is the Swiss bank doing with that amount of

188
00:10:46.371 --> 00:10:47.060
currency?

189
00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.420
<v 0>Listen up a national treasure.</v>

190
00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.180
<v 1>Thanks to the enormous demand for Swiss francs.</v>

191
00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:00.470
The Swiss central bank has accumulated the equivalent of $950 billion in foreign

192
00:11:00.471 --> 00:11:02.210
currency as of June, 2020.

193
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:05.330
And what do you think it has done with such an amount of money? Well,

194
00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:08.900
it hasn't left it sitting idly. It has started to invest all over the world,

195
00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:10.730
particularly in the United States.

196
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:16.340
<v 0>Approximate.</v>

197
00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:20.030
<v 1>Currently 90% of all foreign currency reserves have been invested as follows.</v>

198
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:20.660
Most of it,

199
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:25.370
some 665 billion in debt from countries and large companies and the rest,

200
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:30.110
some $170 billion has been invested directly in shares. In other words,

201
00:11:30.111 --> 00:11:33.410
the Swiss national bank has shares in the world's leading companies amounting to

202
00:11:33.411 --> 00:11:35.480
some $20,000 per capita.

203
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:36.883
<v 0>Impressive.</v>

204
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:45.350
<v 1>Give you an idea on August 5th, 2020, these were his three main positions.</v>

205
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.310
What's the Swiss central bank has become something of a huge investment fund.

206
00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.810
The best thing is that all these positions are financed with new Franks,

207
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.310
with the issue of new currency.

208
00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.220
This is what is popularly known as printing bank notes,

209
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:01.930
who needs oil when you can have Swiss.

210
00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.130
<v 0>The fact is that.</v>

211
00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.590
<v 1>Thanks to the huge international demand for Swiss bank notes,</v>

212
00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.920
the central bank is able to issue more and more Franks Franks,

213
00:12:10.921 --> 00:12:14.670
which have ultimately financed the creation of an immense national treasure and

214
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.620
something that is even more surprising today.

215
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:19.440
The Swiss Franc is not only supported by the Swiss economy,

216
00:12:19.441 --> 00:12:23.580
but also increasingly by this huge portfolio of investment in the best

217
00:12:23.581 --> 00:12:24.414
performing companies.

218
00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:26.123
<v 0>Well.</v>

219
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:28.261
<v 1>Investments,</v>

220
00:12:28.261 --> 00:12:32.040
which as we saw at the beginning are already bringing enormous benefits to the

221
00:12:32.041 --> 00:12:35.280
Swiss economy in 2019 alone, $50 billion.

222
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:39.390
It is a move and experiment that is unprecedented and has led many analysts and

223
00:12:39.391 --> 00:12:42.300
academics to start to consider it a large hedge fund,

224
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.830
a hedge fund that sells Franks go short and Franks and buys goes long on shares

225
00:12:46.831 --> 00:12:49.230
and debt securities. But at this point, the question is,

226
00:12:49.231 --> 00:12:52.140
how far can the Swiss take this strategy? Let's take a look.

227
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.170
<v 2>Sinus Swiss style.</v>

228
00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.070
<v 1>In order for this whole game.</v>

229
00:12:59.071 --> 00:13:02.340
We've outlined to work with the demand for Swiss Franks needs to remain very

230
00:13:02.341 --> 00:13:03.270
high. In other words,

231
00:13:03.271 --> 00:13:06.660
for savers around the world to continue to see Switzerland as a safe place to

232
00:13:06.661 --> 00:13:08.040
deposit their money here,

233
00:13:08.041 --> 00:13:11.460
the competitiveness of the economy and the solvency of the public accounts are

234
00:13:11.461 --> 00:13:16.320
key. The more investors trust,

235
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.570
the greater the demand for Swiss currency will be,

236
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.870
this will allow Switzerland's to continue to sell Franks and buy shares and debt

237
00:13:21.871 --> 00:13:23.700
securities that generate a return.

238
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.170
What's a business printing paper selling it and having people buy it almost as

239
00:13:28.171 --> 00:13:29.130
if it were ounces of gold.

240
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.233
<v 0>No.</v>

241
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:35.100
<v 1>And you know what, at the moment it seems like the numbers are holding up.</v>

242
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:38.490
Public debt is low. The government is financed at negative rates.

243
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.820
Their economy is doing reasonably well. They have practically full employment.

244
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:45.090
Their taxes are moderate. And on top of that, we can find new stories like.

245
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:45.953
<v 0>This.</v>

246
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.480
<v 2>Swiss region may soon beat Hong Kong as best company tax Haven,</v>

247
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.260
Hong Kong will soon lose its status as the place with the world's lowest

248
00:13:55.261 --> 00:13:58.290
corporate tax replaced by the small mountainous,

249
00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.560
Ken of Nidwalden in Switzerland, Bloomberg.

250
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:07.350
<v 1>Excellent is currently carrying out one of the most significant tax reforms in</v>

251
00:14:07.351 --> 00:14:07.950
decades.

252
00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:11.100
Many cantons are drastically reducing the tax burden on corporate profits to

253
00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:13.380
attract more investment and encourage business growth.

254
00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.230
Of course the country also has some problems, but.

255
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.213
<v 0>Lucky problems.</v>

256
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:23.610
<v 1>Is that the strategy followed by the central bankers around so much interest</v>

257
00:14:23.611 --> 00:14:27.480
that some academics are already wondering whether it would not be appropriate

258
00:14:27.481 --> 00:14:30.840
for the Swiss government to take advantage of its ability to finance itself at

259
00:14:30.841 --> 00:14:34.560
negative rates to issue large amounts of debt and use this money to create its

260
00:14:34.561 --> 00:14:36.150
own sovereign fund. Anyway,

261
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.520
as we said at the beginning in matters of skiing and money,

262
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.320
it's best not to mess with the Swiss.

263
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:44.610
In a nutshell, my friends,

264
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.780
this is the amazing story of the most unusual central bank in the world. Now,
