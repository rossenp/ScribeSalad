<v 0>Today's video is sponsored by Ray Khan, home of wireless ear.</v>

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.600
Bud designs inspired by underdogs and big dreams.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.470
Recon earbuds started about half the price of other premium wireless earbud

4
00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:10.801
brands,

5
00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:15.030
but they sound just as amazing as other top audio brands and they look pretty

6
00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:18.420
cool to check it out. These are the everyday ear twenty-five ear buds,

7
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.710
super soft and flexible to fit different sized is they also have a range of

8
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:25.830
colors. What I'm loving about them is the seamless Bluetooth pairing.

9
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:29.250
So I can easily listen to podcasts and audio books when I'm on the go.

10
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.810
These everyday [inaudible] are good for six hours of continuous playtime,

11
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.240
but this handy case doubles as a charger,

12
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.410
and you can recharge up to four times while you're out and about commuting at

13
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:41.880
the gym or wherever life takes you.

14
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.630
So if you want a premium air bar at about half the price of other brands,

15
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.520
just go to buy a break on.com forward slash visual politic to get 15% off your

16
00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:52.040
order. And now let's get in today's.

17
00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.493
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

18
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:05.630
<v 0>Let's be honest.</v>

19
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.800
I'm sure the vast majority of you have seen these unbelievable images of Detroit

20
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.780
sort of abandoned factories, desolate streets,

21
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.480
and neighborhoods with lots of houses boarded up abandoned,

22
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.810
or literally falling down the most popular city in the state of Michigan became

23
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:21.050
a vital player as the American Capitol of the automotive sector.

24
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.140
And therefore also the car capital of the world, important companies,

25
00:01:24.141 --> 00:01:27.830
such as Ford or general motors had their production centers right here.

26
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.270
As a result in 1950, this city had almost 2 million inhabitants.

27
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.021
And by that time,

28
00:01:33.021 --> 00:01:36.680
Detroit had become one of the most attractive places for thousands and thousands

29
00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:41.060
of workers across the country who longs to achieve what is known as the American

30
00:01:41.061 --> 00:01:41.570
dream.

31
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.590
We're talking about a city that was once the fourth largest city in the United

32
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.650
States behind only New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. However,

33
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.760
something happened.

34
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.600
And from the 1950s on everything began to collapse like a house of cards.

35
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.550
Companies began to close.

36
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.210
There were cuts in production chains and many factories of support companies in

37
00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:04.070
the automotive sector were affected.

38
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.030
It all started to fall apart and look proof of the storm that had just been set

39
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:12.740
in motion is the fact that by 1960 Detroit had already lost nearly

40
00:02:12.741 --> 00:02:15.290
200,000 inhabitants. Yes, yes.

41
00:02:15.291 --> 00:02:20.240
200,000 fewer inhabitants in just 10 years. Even worse. Since that time,

42
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.660
the city has been diminishing decade after decade until today.

43
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.980
And at this very moment,

44
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.850
the population of the city barely exceeds 670,000 in half.

45
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.190
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

46
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.870
<v 0>You see in the shop, the data doesn't lie.</v>

47
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.380
It almost looks like the depiction of a city doomed to become a ghost.

48
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.810
Should the vast majority of those who stayed, had very low incomes.

49
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.020
People who in many cases live in virtually marginal,

50
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.630
extremely poor and very insecure environment.

51
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.900
The point is that with this phenomenon,

52
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.390
we can find two great leading lines of argument.

53
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.840
Those who blame capitalism and those who blame the complete opposite bad

54
00:03:07.841 --> 00:03:10.120
policies that led to this ghastly situation.

55
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.060
But the truth is that in one way or another, for many people,

56
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.020
Detroit has become something of a living example of the failure of American

57
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:17.590
capitalism,

58
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.370
or at least an example that the American dream that so many talk about it.

59
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:23.830
Doesn't always work. Now, is this really the case?

60
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.040
Was it really evil capitalism that caused the fall of Detroit?

61
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.480
What is the city really like today? And what future does this city have? Well,

62
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.070
these other questions are what we're going to try to answer for you here today

63
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.360
on visual politic, let's get.

64
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.810
<v 1>The role of the engine.</v>

65
00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.070
Look at these images.

66
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.550
<v 0>There's empty spaces you see on the blocks will once how's it spot then why are</v>

67
00:04:08.551 --> 00:04:10.590
there so many gaps? Because over the past few years,

68
00:04:10.591 --> 00:04:14.490
the Detroit city council has tried to tear down every abandoned house to avoid

69
00:04:14.491 --> 00:04:15.324
it being occupied,

70
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.960
used for illegal activities or for the use of prohibited substances.

71
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:22.920
That is to avoid as much possible new pockets of uncontrolled criminality.

72
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.090
Once. However,

73
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.080
all those lumps were normal middle and working class residential areas like

74
00:04:31.081 --> 00:04:33.330
those. We could find in any other us city,

75
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.540
but these days they are places best avoided because the truth is,

76
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:40.050
if you do go and then manage to get out safely with all your belongings,

77
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.450
you could consider yourself a very lucky person.

78
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.500
The fact is that these neighborhoods were the result of a huge demographic boom,

79
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.660
and about three decades in just 30 years,

80
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.780
between 1920 and 1950 Detroit's population doubled.

81
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.790
And in 10 years from 1920 to 1930, the population grew by nearly 600,000.

82
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.330
So the question is, why did so many people suddenly start coming to Detroit?

83
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.100
What did the city offer? Where did they?

84
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.380
<v 1>Well.</v>

85
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.270
<v 0>The late 19th and early 20th centuries,</v>

86
00:05:09.271 --> 00:05:12.210
Detroit began to develop a powerful automotive industry,

87
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.960
dozens of small factories of early model and rudimentary cars began to open in

88
00:05:15.961 --> 00:05:17.160
different parts of the city.

89
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.820
And one of them was precisely that of Henry Ford who founded the Detroit

90
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.500
automobile company there in 1899, initially business wasn't as good as expected.

91
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.300
And just two years later closed down,

92
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.110
having sold only 20 cars and lost the equivalent of more than 2 million, a half,

93
00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:34.800
a million dollars in today's money. And after Ford, second failed attempt,

94
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.140
the Ford motor company was founded in 1903.

95
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.230
We have an investment of less than 800,000 in today's dollars.

96
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.820
And as the saying goes, third time.

97
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:45.300
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

98
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.800
<v 0>That despite it's what we've always been told,</v>

99
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.340
Harry Ford was not the first to have an automobile production line. No,

100
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.670
the first mass produced car was in fact an Oldsmobile.

101
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.010
<v 1>That's dad. However, what.</v>

102
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.970
<v 0>Is true is that was Ford who managed to bring the system to levels of efficiency</v>

103
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.960
and profitability never seen before in such a way that he managed to reduce both

104
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:08.240
costs and production times dramatically.

105
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.130
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

106
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.150
<v 0>In fact, Ford isn't,</v>

107
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.930
which is how this production system is known was what changed Detroit forever.

108
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:20.620
And take note,

109
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.100
because I'm not just referring to the city's economy or its industrial model,

110
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.870
but also to its demographic structure,

111
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.890
Ford's model began to be replicated and factories started to grow and grow.

112
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.470
And of course that meant more and more workers were needed,

113
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.980
which caused a boom in new inhabitants who were mostly members of African

114
00:06:35.981 --> 00:06:38.890
American communities off the South. And that, well,

115
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.050
let's say it wasn't that simple. Think about it.

116
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.600
We're talking about the early 20th century at the time,

117
00:06:43.601 --> 00:06:47.380
the United States like virtually all Western countries was tremendously racist.

118
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.090
And of course, in that context,

119
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.480
the arrival of thousands of black people in a city that until then had been

120
00:06:52.481 --> 00:06:54.700
mostly white generated all kinds of problems,

121
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.150
great racial tension and a huge mistrust among the local inhabitants.

122
00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.640
And this is why whites began to move to the periphery,

123
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.380
to newly built residential areas.

124
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:06.700
So that Detroit's most central areas became the modest and marginal areas over

125
00:07:06.701 --> 00:07:10.630
the years because of social exclusion and a pressing lack of sufficient housing,

126
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.270
all the workers who were arriving. But at this point,

127
00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.100
many of you may be thinking, but hang on, Josh,

128
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.760
what on earth do racial tensions and housing problems have to do with the

129
00:07:18.761 --> 00:07:21.730
decline of Detroit? Well, a lot more than we might think at first.

130
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:25.750
<v 1>You see.</v>

131
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.600
<v 0>All these racial tensions were fed and grew over the years.</v>

132
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.680
And sometimes they ended up exploding eventually even causing a very serious

133
00:07:32.681 --> 00:07:37.290
unrest riots, such as 1967, where, because of a false rumor,

134
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:38.950
more than 2,500 shops,

135
00:07:38.951 --> 00:07:42.820
belonging to the white population will loot it at where more than 400 buildings,

136
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.700
including many residential buildings and houses were burned,

137
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:49.180
raised to the ground. And here we arrive at a crucial moment.

138
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.720
What do you think for your authorities response was well for many experts,

139
00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:53.980
it is precisely here.

140
00:07:53.981 --> 00:07:57.760
That is the real source of a problem that has continued to this present day

141
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:07.060
In Detroit and Michigan did not want anything similar to the 1967 riots to ever

142
00:08:07.061 --> 00:08:09.880
happen again. So they undertook ambitious social programs,

143
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:12.250
such as hiring black minorities in the public sector,

144
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.150
subsidizing and launching the fair housing act and ambitious affordable housing

145
00:08:16.151 --> 00:08:19.930
program that sought to settle the lover earning population in downtown Detroit,

146
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:24.400
an urban space emptied by the March of the white population to the outskirts and

147
00:08:24.401 --> 00:08:27.160
other cities. Detroit first became a great testing lab,

148
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.830
but this social experiment failed miserably over the years,

149
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.340
this kind of policy caused many of Detroit's inhabitants to become public

150
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.610
government renters, which over the years created a new social divide.

151
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.420
A large part of the population was not integrated into the productive sector and

152
00:08:40.421 --> 00:08:42.790
had no incentives to compete even worse.

153
00:08:42.791 --> 00:08:45.970
These kinds of policies didn't work when it came to correcting the big problems

154
00:08:45.971 --> 00:08:47.010
the city was going through,

155
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.810
they did nothing to alleviate social exclusion or racial tensions.

156
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.320
White flight from businesses and neighborhoods was not stopped.

157
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.060
Violence was not tackled and the of new businesses was not stimulated.

158
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.490
And so little by little Detroit faded away.

159
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:04.940
<v 1>Surprised, well, wait a minute, because that was at the beginning.</v>

160
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.390
<v 0>It's off the old car factories of the early 20th century began to close.</v>

161
00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:14.510
They were no longer feasible for the enormous production required by the new

162
00:09:14.511 --> 00:09:15.080
times,

163
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.230
nor for the growing automation that was beginning to be used in this kind of

164
00:09:18.231 --> 00:09:18.770
plant.

165
00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:22.640
So the big automobile brands began to build new factories first on the periphery

166
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:26.570
on the outskirts of Detroit and later in the face of the city's growing conflict

167
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:30.500
and to the higher tax and labor costs that were a result of all those social

168
00:09:30.501 --> 00:09:30.980
plans,

169
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.130
the specialist technicians took their factories elsewhere in the United States,

170
00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.460
which of course only accelerated the process of the population and

171
00:09:37.461 --> 00:09:39.140
impoverishment of the city.

172
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:42.680
And so as the businesses and residents that could afford to pack up and find a

173
00:09:42.681 --> 00:09:44.780
new place to start over, continue to leave.

174
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:49.190
So little by little Detroit became a city increasingly dependent on social

175
00:09:49.191 --> 00:09:53.480
programs and that in turn made the city's financial situation and enormous

176
00:09:53.481 --> 00:09:54.314
ticking time bomb

177
00:09:58.970 --> 00:09:59.600
On one hand,

178
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.870
the loss of population and productive infrastructure cause tax revenues to sink.

179
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:03.980
But on the other hand,

180
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:08.000
the different mayors of Detroit kept spending and spending money in huge amounts

181
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:12.020
to try and reverse the problem from huge social plans to major public works

182
00:10:12.021 --> 00:10:15.050
programs. And of course, if on one hand we have less income.

183
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.350
And on the other hand, we spend more than disaster is just around the corner.

184
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:20.420
And you know what that pretty much explains what happened.

185
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:24.080
The city's finances were getting worse until finally in 2013,

186
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:28.400
the city faced to fault. Basically Detroit went bankrupt, but hold on a minute,

187
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.790
because here right here is where a completely different story begins.

188
00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.790
You want to know what today's Detroit looks like and what tomorrow's Detroit

189
00:10:34.791 --> 00:10:36.020
might look like? Well.

190
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:43.640
<v 1>A new Stanford, Detroit, is it possible.</v>

191
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.210
<v 0>The situation for a moment?</v>

192
00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:52.040
Think of it as a mental exercise before the 2013 default Detroit was so

193
00:10:52.041 --> 00:10:55.430
ruined that it didn't even have the money to keep basic utilities to a decent

194
00:10:55.431 --> 00:10:58.490
level, no garbage, no water, no pipe maintenance or servers,

195
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.280
needless to say no security, either over the years,

196
00:11:01.281 --> 00:11:04.970
the city has accumulated a huge $14 billion debt.

197
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.380
And in 2013 alone,

198
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:10.910
the city's budget deficit reached nearly $320 million. And remember,

199
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:15.200
we're talking about a city that at the time had only 690,000 inhabitants.

200
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.190
That is the municipal debt was more than $20,000 for each inhabitant.

201
00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.510
And that is a lot, a lot of money for a small city council. In fact,

202
00:11:23.511 --> 00:11:27.170
it is almost as much as all the public debt per capita of a country.

203
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.830
For example, Spain taking into account all local councils regions,

204
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:32.930
the central government, etc. And of course, uh,

205
00:11:32.931 --> 00:11:36.830
city hall has neither the resources nor the sources of income that an entire

206
00:11:36.831 --> 00:11:37.670
country has.

207
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:40.910
<v 1>Well.</v>

208
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:44.390
<v 0>The thing is this situation caused the city to be enforced a number of severe</v>

209
00:11:44.391 --> 00:11:45.470
cuts. For example,

210
00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:49.100
public employees had to accept significant pay cuts and forced unpaid leave,

211
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.670
or the United States federal government itself had to intervene in the accounts

212
00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:54.100
of the, to restructure them.

213
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.610
The good news for Detroit is that this whole process didn't last long following

214
00:11:57.611 --> 00:12:00.460
the intervention of the federal government and agreements to eliminate and

215
00:12:00.461 --> 00:12:02.380
restructure more than 7 billion in debt.

216
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.260
The city managed to get out of its bankruptcy. As a side note,

217
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.860
this basically means that the many creditors lost a good portion of their money

218
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.620
and careful here, because we're talking about things like pension funds.

219
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:15.630
However,

220
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:19.350
since then the city has had to follow a strict spending control plan that has

221
00:12:19.351 --> 00:12:22.770
forced the authorities to submit surplus accounts year after year,

222
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.430
something that has allowed the debts to continue to be reduced whilst gradually

223
00:12:26.431 --> 00:12:30.090
improving security conditions and public services. At the same time.

224
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:30.750
For example,

225
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.900
the empty plots we saw at the beginning of this video were occupied by ruined

226
00:12:33.901 --> 00:12:37.080
houses that in many cases functioned as ends of crime.

227
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.260
The city council didn't even have the money to demolish them. However,

228
00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.600
all of this gradually changed after the difference

229
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:49.740
Fact against all odds. Detroit has become a small investment center.

230
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.830
Private investment has been returning to the city in recent years.

231
00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.130
People that were once fearful in investing in the city,

232
00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.550
just fell over themselves to invest in Detroit. If you go to Detroit,

233
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:02.340
now it's a different city than it was five years ago.

234
00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:04.800
It has a different image and it is a vibrant city.

235
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:08.730
James McTiVia managing member of McTiVia associates in Detroit.

236
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.050
Any of these investments are coming mostly from large capital in New York and

237
00:13:13.051 --> 00:13:14.550
Los Angeles. And to this day,

238
00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:18.330
it is possible to see rehabilitation projects of gigantic buildings that were

239
00:13:18.331 --> 00:13:19.950
abandoned in the heart of the city.

240
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:29.940
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

241
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.060
<v 0>Only that even industry itself is starting to flourish. Again,</v>

242
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:39.030
th Chrysler plans, Michigan investment with 6,500 jobs. The New York times,

243
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:44.010
the Italian American automaker said it plans to spend $4.5 billion over the next

244
00:13:44.011 --> 00:13:48.180
three years to update several Detroit plants and retool and engine plant to make

245
00:13:48.181 --> 00:13:49.230
Jeeps and efforts.

246
00:13:49.231 --> 00:13:53.880
The company said would create about 6,500 new jobs is even more in

247
00:13:53.881 --> 00:13:57.900
2018. The Ford motor company purchased the former Michigan central station,

248
00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:01.770
a large abandoned area that is always shown in Detroit footage and began

249
00:14:01.771 --> 00:14:06.690
rehabilitating it with a $740 million investment Ford's idea is to

250
00:14:06.691 --> 00:14:09.600
move its autonomous vehicle development team to this building,

251
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:13.440
gradually giving a second chance to the city that saw them initially succeed.

252
00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.030
What's more from a social point of view.

253
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:18.510
One of the programs that is generating the most hope is curiously,

254
00:14:18.511 --> 00:14:22.620
an ambitious reintegration plan that the authorities have put in place for all

255
00:14:22.621 --> 00:14:25.440
those who have been in prison and friends believe me.

256
00:14:25.441 --> 00:14:26.790
We talk about a lot of people.

257
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:30.000
Remember that the city has suffered with decades of crime and that it is still

258
00:14:30.001 --> 00:14:33.480
one of the most dangerous places in the United States to give you an idea about

259
00:14:33.481 --> 00:14:37.620
15% of the population of this city has a history of serious crime.

260
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:41.130
<v 1>Well.</v>

261
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:45.360
<v 0>The Michigan department of corrections releases about 9,000 inmates each year,</v>

262
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:49.020
25% of whom end up going to Wayne County in Detroit,

263
00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:53.000
getting out of jail and being reintegrated. Society is difficult in any country,

264
00:14:53.001 --> 00:14:54.200
but in the United States,

265
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.460
it can become even more so about 60% of people on parole in Michigan do not have

266
00:14:58.461 --> 00:15:02.330
a job and many attempted to return to some sort of crime in order to survive.

267
00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:05.630
Another problem faced is that many fail to find a landlord who wants to rent

268
00:15:05.631 --> 00:15:06.410
them a place to live.

269
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:10.160
Therefore Detroit city has passed an ordinance that prevents the vast majority

270
00:15:10.161 --> 00:15:12.800
of landlords from being able to rule out, renting a home,

271
00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.310
to have a person based on their criminal record plans have also been put into

272
00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:20.270
place to promote the labor participation of former prisoners and partnerships

273
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.360
have been set up to accompany these people to achieve full reintegrate.

274
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:26.380
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

275
00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.110
<v 0>By the way, this topic we need to talk about in much more detail,</v>

276
00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.130
we'll have to make another video.

277
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:34.660
<v 1>How's that.</v>

278
00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:35.140
<v 0>Friends,</v>

279
00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:39.010
the situation today is that despite all the achievements that have been seen in

280
00:15:39.011 --> 00:15:40.150
recent years in Detroit,

281
00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:44.380
the crisis of the Corona virus pandemic is putting all those advances at risk.

282
00:15:44.381 --> 00:15:48.850
Once more as the Corona virus takes, hold in Detroit pandemic,

283
00:15:48.851 --> 00:15:53.470
magnifies cities, poverty, racial disparities, CNBC indeed.

284
00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:57.070
The great economic crisis that is coming because of this pandemic is putting

285
00:15:57.071 --> 00:16:01.600
many of the investments that Detroit had secured at risk as investing in Detroit

286
00:16:01.601 --> 00:16:05.050
carries far more risks than investments in other parts of the United States.

287
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.170
And besides the coronavirus hit Detroit pretty hard, even worse.

288
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.650
The population most effected by the pandemic is precisely the most vulnerable

289
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:16.420
the African-American population. Anyway,

290
00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:18.940
this is the story of the golden age, the rapid fall,

291
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.660
and the apparent rebirth of one of the most important cities of the industrial

292
00:16:22.661 --> 00:16:26.470
search in the 20th century and a symbol of America's economic power,

293
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.140
a city that illustrates how on many occasions,

294
00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.740
the intent of public policies falls far short of the results,

295
00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:33.700
but now it's your turn.

296
00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.940
Do you think Detroit could become America's new car Capitol in a couple of

297
00:16:36.941 --> 00:16:37.540
decades?

298
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.500
Can the city get over the coronavirus crisis and continue to grow once the worst

299
00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:42.670
of the pandemic passes?

300
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:46.360
What do you think we can learn from how racial tensions and how bad public

301
00:16:46.361 --> 00:16:49.330
policies ended? One of America's most vibrant cities,
