00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:13.851
<v 1>Friends.</v>

3
00:00:13.851 --> 00:00:17.420
If there is one thing that gets on the nerves of the North Korean regime,

4
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.970
and that is capable of unsettling, Kim Jong-un himself,

5
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.300
it is international sanctions because as you probably suspect,

6
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.630
North Korea is one of the countries most severely punished by international

7
00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:27.770
sanctions worldwide,

8
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.210
perhaps the most what's the North Korean regime understands as an economic

9
00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:34.550
blockade by the U S empire against the Jews.

10
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.040
Chase socialist system is in reality,

11
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.510
a joint response by most countries of the world against Pyongyang's nuclear and

12
00:00:41.511 --> 00:00:42.890
ballistic missile program,

13
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.790
a program to which the regime has given the highest priority over the past

14
00:00:46.791 --> 00:00:47.420
decades.

15
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.050
And let's face it developing from scratch the capacity to build nuclear bombs

16
00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:54.320
and manufacture Intercontinental missiles does not exactly come cheap,

17
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.380
especially given the very poor living standards of North Koreans.

18
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.670
But you know how this works,

19
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.630
the needs of the regime are paramount and there are all those patriotic songs to

20
00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:04.100
live up to take a look at the facts.

21
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.630
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

22
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.350
<v 1>Estimated that the cost of these North Korean military programs has been between</v>

23
00:01:12.351 --> 00:01:17.120
one and $3 billion in the case of the nuclear program and more than $1 billion a

24
00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:19.340
year. In the case of the ballistics program,

25
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.930
to give you an example for the cost of launching a single Intercontinental

26
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.100
missile, along with the launch facilities,

27
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.790
almost 3 million tons of corn could be purchased. And of course,

28
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.610
in a country where people literally Battlestar vation,

29
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.200
this expenditure is alarming.

30
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.140
The fact is that this is the main reason why both the United States and the

31
00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:43.250
United nations security council have been pushing for years for economic and

32
00:01:43.251 --> 00:01:47.750
trade sanctions against North Korea in order to try to persuade the regime to

33
00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:49.790
abandon these military programs. However,

34
00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:53.990
the reality is that apart from the enormous economic damage to the communist

35
00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:56.780
country caused by the sanctions during the last seven years,

36
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.350
the objective of preventing the advance of these programs has not been

37
00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:04.220
fulfilled. So the question we need to ask is why haven't the sanctions worked?

38
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.990
How was it possible that North Korea,

39
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.100
despite being a country that is fenced off backward and subject to all kinds of

40
00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:14.000
sanctions has managed to become a full blown nuclear power? Well, friends,

41
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.610
this is something as simple to answer as it is complex to explain.

42
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.220
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

43
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.060
<v 1>North Korea has an elaborate and complex mechanism for evading sanctions that</v>

44
00:02:26.061 --> 00:02:28.670
consists of elements as disparate, as bank robbery,

45
00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:30.920
through financial engineering, cyber attacks,

46
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.060
and computer viruses trafficking in precious metals and illegal trade in

47
00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:38.510
international waters among other methods. And if we add to all this,

48
00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:41.000
the umbrella offered by countries like China and Russia,

49
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.730
which although they recognize and accept the sanctions,

50
00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:47.360
do not do much to enforce them. What we find is that in spite of everything,

51
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.570
the North Korean regime has managed to keep its income streams open.

52
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.583
Despite this.

53
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.160
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

54
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.460
<v 1>Remember, we are talking about the regime itself and not to the country.</v>

55
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.730
Things are different on the national level,

56
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.090
the estimates of the central bank of Korea, that of the South, of course,

57
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.750
estimates that's the North Korean economy has been contracting for at least

58
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:12.670
three years at closer 5% per year. This is the worst recession since 1997,

59
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:14.590
but of course the figures are based on estimates,

60
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.580
trade studies and other somewhat abstract analysis because the regime does not

61
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:20.860
provide any information on actual figures,

62
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.290
All of this however, force North Korea to take action,

63
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.310
which will take effect next January, 2021.

64
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.240
<v 2>Kim Jong UHIN makes rare admission of economic failure, Korea,</v>

65
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:37.530
Joan Ong daily,

66
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.150
North Korea to set five-year economic plan at Congress next year,

67
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.160
KCNA Kim Jong una notes that the country had faced unexpected and inevitable

68
00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:48.420
challenges. Nikkei.

69
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.180
<v 1>Can review, however, even with everything that is going on,</v>

70
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.600
the reality that is despite the Corona virus, economic sanctions,

71
00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:56.370
and almost anything else that happens,

72
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.400
the nuclear and ballistic programs continue in this video,

73
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.210
we will tell you some of the ways in which North Korea has definitely bypassed

74
00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:07.620
both us and UN sanctions and how pressure from the American empire has fallen

75
00:04:07.621 --> 00:04:11.430
way short of having any effect on North Korea's military programs.

76
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.290
What's you about to see is the real world beyond big office politics, listen up.

77
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.890
<v 0>Are you a sanctioned failing.</v>

78
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.460
<v 1>Dear friends of visual politic before we dive in and analyze whether or not the</v>

79
00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:33.660
U S sanctions have failed.

80
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.020
There are a couple of things we need to consider the first is that although

81
00:04:37.021 --> 00:04:41.160
North Korea has stopped for the time being it's nuclear tests, it's atomic bomb,

82
00:04:41.161 --> 00:04:43.200
production facilities remain intact.

83
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.650
Also keep in mind that the fact that they no longer perform tests does not

84
00:04:46.651 --> 00:04:49.500
necessarily indicate any particular gesture. Instead,

85
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.740
it could mean that they no longer need to prove anything because they have

86
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.830
already completed this phase of the program. The second we need to know,

87
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.640
even whilst in the middle of talks with the United States and South Korea on

88
00:04:59.641 --> 00:05:01.260
peace and denuclearization,

89
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.630
the communist regime has continued to launch missiles.

90
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.030
<v 0>For example.</v>

91
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.390
<v 1>On the 2nd of March, 2020, North Korea launched to short range,</v>

92
00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:14.310
ballistic missiles into the East sea.

93
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.080
This was not unusual because throughout 2019 North Korea launched 25 missiles

94
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.230
and conducted 13 more tests at its facilities.

95
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.890
Therefore the North Korean ballistics program continues to operate at full

96
00:05:25.891 --> 00:05:27.120
capacity. Despite this,

97
00:05:27.121 --> 00:05:30.510
the Trump administration has neither condemned it nor done anything to punish

98
00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:33.600
this type of behavior, which is a clear violation of UN resume.

99
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.500
<v 0>Butts.</v>

100
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.480
<v 1>Let's get back to the key question on this video.</v>

101
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.750
How can North Korea finance all these programs if the country,

102
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.950
which is very poor is also subject to very strong international sanctions.

103
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.870
Now this is not a minor question.

104
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.400
The communist country cannot export precious metals or iron or coal or mineral

105
00:05:53.401 --> 00:05:56.580
sands or agriculture products or fish or seafood or textiles,

106
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.540
nor it import machinery vehicles, crude oil,

107
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.920
or refined oil above the limit set by the UN of 500,000 barrels a year.

108
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.470
And these are only just a few examples.

109
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.260
The sanctions literally obstruct North Korea's ability to sell what little it

110
00:06:14.261 --> 00:06:17.680
produces, coal, mineral sands, and textiles. However,

111
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.880
check out this news headline.

112
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.390
<v 2>North Korea increases illegal coal exports,</v>

113
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.850
satellite images suggest financial times.

114
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.650
<v 1>Exactly. As we mentioned earlier,</v>

115
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.090
North Korea has developed a complicated system of exports and imports on the

116
00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:35.050
high seas through ship to ship transfers and an extensive network of shell

117
00:06:35.051 --> 00:06:37.270
companies and shady middlemen. These transfers,

118
00:06:37.271 --> 00:06:39.160
which occur in international waters,

119
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:43.300
or even in Chinese territorial waters allow North Korea to bring in more than

120
00:06:43.301 --> 00:06:47.800
$1 billion each year in order to do this ships with flags and registers that

121
00:06:47.801 --> 00:06:51.580
frequently change are usually used. We are talking about countries like Togo,

122
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.170
Tanzania, Sierra Leone,

123
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.250
or even Panama since these countries do not register or have very lax control

124
00:06:57.251 --> 00:06:59.350
systems of their fleets. More importantly,

125
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.100
this practice circumvents the ban on ship to ship transfers with North Korean

126
00:07:03.101 --> 00:07:07.900
flag vessels established by UN security council resolution 2375,

127
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.350
but stay tuned because North Korea is income. Doesn't stop at Kohl's.

128
00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:23.020
We also exports mineral sands to companies in China with total impunity also by

129
00:07:23.021 --> 00:07:25.780
the way of ship to ship transfers in 2019 alone,

130
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.800
at least $22 million worth of this sand was sold to Chinese companies.

131
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.070
These sands are mainly used for construction and in 2019,

132
00:07:33.071 --> 00:07:36.820
the center for advanced defense studies detected a sharp increase in shipping

133
00:07:36.821 --> 00:07:39.850
activity, extracting Sams on the coast of Haikou.

134
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:40.863
<v 0>Right.</v>

135
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.140
<v 1>But more than 100 ships flying,</v>

136
00:07:47.141 --> 00:07:50.740
the Chinese flag were detected sailing in the vicinity off the hydro mining

137
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.760
site.

138
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.840
<v 2>The activity, and had you demonstrate scale and a level of sophistication.</v>

139
00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:00.040
Unlike other known cases of North Korean sanctions of Asian at seed providing

140
00:08:00.041 --> 00:08:04.810
renewed evidence of the DPRK is evolving abilities to coordinate and execute

141
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.790
complex operations with facilitators abroad, C4, ADSL report.

142
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:13.330
<v 1>That's not even the full extent of North Korea's revenues outside of the</v>

143
00:08:13.331 --> 00:08:14.164
sanction.

144
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.830
Maria also has an entire army of overseas workers,

145
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.490
especially in China who send foreign currency back to North Korea through a

146
00:08:24.491 --> 00:08:27.160
complex financial network that includes tax havens.

147
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.670
Although the UN forced these workers to be repatriated back to North Korea.

148
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:35.290
The truth is that a good number of the 100,000 workers in 2017 are still working

149
00:08:35.291 --> 00:08:37.120
in China and Southeast Asia.

150
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.060
And we're not talking about a minor issue to give you an idea of the money that

151
00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:44.260
arrives in North Korea from this activity alone that's year 2017,

152
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.940
the communist regime received around $2 billion in the form of remittances and

153
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.920
artificially exorbitant taxes.

154
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:54.550
So exactly how does all that money get to North Korea? Well,

155
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.700
part of the answer can be found here in.

156
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.533
<v 2>This research,</v>

157
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.910
us indicts North Koreans accused state state-owned bank of evading sanctions

158
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:03.590
Reuters.

159
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:07.640
<v 1>The investigation into this case concluded that North Korea's foreign trade bank</v>

160
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:11.780
employed at least 250 shell companies to make payments to the government worth

161
00:09:11.781 --> 00:09:13.970
$2.5 billion. In fact,

162
00:09:13.971 --> 00:09:18.020
the transfers came from countries as disparate and of dubious transparency as

163
00:09:18.021 --> 00:09:20.570
China, Russia, Libya, and Thailand. No surprise.

164
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:21.883
<v 0>That.</v>

165
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:30.050
<v 1>North Korea has a huge state owned chain of restaurants. Yes,</v>

166
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:34.270
restaurants with about 125 branches scattered around the world today.

167
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.410
It is not known how many of them are still open.

168
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.110
Although there is evidence that there are several dozen, well,

169
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.190
this chain is called Pyongyang and its structure is based on a network of

170
00:09:43.191 --> 00:09:46.820
companies that collaborate with local companies through joint ventures in the

171
00:09:46.821 --> 00:09:49.700
countries where they operate restaurants. That's by the way,

172
00:09:49.701 --> 00:09:51.920
also serve to launder money from shady,

173
00:09:51.921 --> 00:09:55.940
illegal activities that are absorbed within the income of those restaurants.

174
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.230
And one important point.

175
00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.260
All of what we are telling you is not something from the past or anything like

176
00:10:00.261 --> 00:10:00.560
that.

177
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.950
It is what is happening right now at the very point in time that you're watching

178
00:10:03.951 --> 00:10:07.970
this video methods that are currently being used to finance Kim Jong-un's wimps,

179
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.350
including his ballistic missiles.

180
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:13.910
<v 0>Meanwhile.</v>

181
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:14.810
<v 1>The U S government,</v>

182
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.320
which is the main supporter and promoter of the sanctions against the regime in

183
00:10:18.321 --> 00:10:21.620
Pyongyang has remained silence with its arms firmly crossed.

184
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:25.430
It almost seems that the Trump administration's strategy in North Korea has been

185
00:10:25.431 --> 00:10:26.630
to let Kim do, as he bleeds,

186
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.110
it's both with his missiles and with the money he handles abroad with

187
00:10:30.111 --> 00:10:32.360
negotiations like this, it's easy to succeed.

188
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.190
You just have to give everything they asked,

189
00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:36.590
then claim you fix the relationship. Just like that.

190
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.920
The fact is friends that throughout this whole saga of evading sanctions,

191
00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.900
there are some episodes that leave us stunned.

192
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:45.800
What if I told you that North Korea had managed to illegally export coal to its

193
00:10:45.801 --> 00:10:48.110
bitter enemy its neighbor South Korea?

194
00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:52.490
What if I told you that a shipment of luxury Mercedes Benz destined for North

195
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:56.600
Korea passed through the South Korean port of Busan with total impunity? Yes.

196
00:10:56.601 --> 00:11:00.200
We're not getting to the regime elites managed to buy everything they want and

197
00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:01.880
they don't even have to depend on China.

198
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.880
North Korea literally lives on the edge. Take a look.

199
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:11.960
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

200
00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.570
<v 2>Closer to the danger. Further from the damage.</v>

201
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:17.323
<v 0>We just told you.</v>

202
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:22.070
<v 1>That's in 2019 North Korea managed to export coal illegally to South Korea each</v>

203
00:11:22.071 --> 00:11:26.210
and every customs check failed and millions of dollars in North Korean coal

204
00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.600
seeped through Pohang port, the recipient and a max,

205
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.170
a South Korean company that bought the coal from another company registered in

206
00:11:33.171 --> 00:11:33.680
Hong Kong.

207
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.280
And it was transported by the very same ship that took several luxury.

208
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.350
Mercedes-Benz from Europe to North Korea.

209
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:43.880
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

210
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.300
<v 1>In fact that ship registered as DN 55 Oh five,</v>

211
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.880
unloaded the coal in South Korea on the return trip.

212
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:53.060
After dropping off Kim's high-end vehicles in the communist country.

213
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.790
[inaudible] We're talking about Mercedes vehicles bought by the North Korean

214
00:12:02.791 --> 00:12:07.500
government for Kim Jong-un himself of the Mayback S 62 and the Mayback S

215
00:12:07.501 --> 00:12:11.730
600 Pullman guard models. We are talking about the fully armored models.

216
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.840
Each one costs between $500,000 and $1.6 million. You know,

217
00:12:15.841 --> 00:12:17.850
the story it's a matter of priority.

218
00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:22.080
Well,

219
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.040
the fact is that these luxury cars traveled through six countries from Rotterdam

220
00:12:26.041 --> 00:12:26.701
in the Netherlands,

221
00:12:26.701 --> 00:12:31.590
where the cars left to Dalian in China on one ship and from there to sucker

222
00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.420
Japan on a totally different boat.

223
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:38.400
And from there 2% in South Korea on yet another ship and Busan is where the cars

224
00:12:38.401 --> 00:12:42.600
were transferred to the infamous freighter DN 55 Oh five from Busan.

225
00:12:42.601 --> 00:12:45.660
They left for Nikon in Russia, and finally on the same ship,

226
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:49.170
they were unloaded in North Korea where the coal was supposedly loaded and ended

227
00:12:49.171 --> 00:12:52.590
up in Pohang dizzying trip.

228
00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.330
But the Mercedes got there in the end,

229
00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:58.050
the luxury Mercedes that Kim Jong-un shows off at his summits with international

230
00:12:58.051 --> 00:13:00.630
leaders, such as Donald Trump himself passed through countries,

231
00:13:00.631 --> 00:13:04.530
allied with the United States, such as Japan, the Netherlands and South Korea,

232
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:07.050
without anyone actually noticing, of course,

233
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.790
it's like looking for a needle in a haystack,

234
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.040
North Koreans know this and take advantage of it.

235
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.030
It matters worse for tenants relations of the U S government with Russia and

236
00:13:18.031 --> 00:13:19.110
above all with China,

237
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.620
with whom they continue an open trade war have kept these countries from

238
00:13:22.621 --> 00:13:27.000
collaborating to punish historical enemies of the United States like North

239
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.320
Korea. In fact, in the last two years,

240
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.300
China has substantially relaxed the pressure.

241
00:13:30.301 --> 00:13:33.630
It has been exerting against North Korea to prevent imports of sanction.

242
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:36.540
<v 0>Products. We're talking about.</v>

243
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:40.650
<v 1>A lack of collaboration that has reached the point that huge North Korean cargo</v>

244
00:13:40.651 --> 00:13:44.010
and bulk carriers have been seen in Chinese waters off Joe Shan,

245
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.610
and one of the most heavily patrolled and militarized areas off the Chinese

246
00:13:47.611 --> 00:13:48.444
coast.

247
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.600
<v 0>An area where China.</v>

248
00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.950
<v 1>Has Naval basis with frigates, destroyers, electronic surveillance vessels,</v>

249
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.840
and radars of all kinds come on.

250
00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:00.960
It is impossible to think that the Chinese government is not aware of these

251
00:14:00.961 --> 00:14:01.860
movements. Isn't it?

252
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.400
So the question we should be asking is has Trump's foreign policy and

253
00:14:05.401 --> 00:14:09.390
international sanctions serve to end North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile

254
00:14:09.391 --> 00:14:11.130
program? Well, the answer is definitely no.

255
00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.830
Moreover, the sanctions are more poorest today than ever.

256
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.820
And as long as POM yang is able to escape them with such impunity and with so

257
00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:25.920
much support the policy of negotiating,

258
00:14:25.921 --> 00:14:29.670
the renunciation of nuclear weapons in exchange for lifting the sanctions does

259
00:14:29.671 --> 00:14:32.010
not make much sense. Or in other words,

260
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.820
why would Kim Jong-un abandon either of his two star military programs?

261
00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.690
If what he gets in return is relief from sanctions that he budges when and how

262
00:14:39.691 --> 00:14:42.150
he wants at least to keep the regime satisfied.

263
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.220
If later on the people go hungry. Well,

264
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.880
obviously that is down to the misfortune and the workings of the evil American.

265
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:52.400
<v 0>Empire. We see how events unfold.</v>

266
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.450
<v 1>But the truth is that North Korea is much stronger militarily today than it was</v>

267
00:14:56.451 --> 00:14:59.570
four years ago. And that is a reality that to a large extent,

268
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.690
has a lot to do with Trump's foreign policy in the white house.

269
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.830
But now it's your turn.

270
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.190
Do you think the way forward is to further deepen sanctions against North Korea?

271
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.760
Is there an alternative diplomacy to the economic blockade that could serve to

272
00:15:10.761 --> 00:15:13.790
weaken the North Korean regime, leave your answers down in the comments?
