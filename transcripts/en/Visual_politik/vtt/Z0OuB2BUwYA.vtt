<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.090
<v 1>SARS coronavirus. Two pandemic has helped us all to learn something new.</v>

3
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.820
Some have learned to make homemade bread while others have learned that you can

4
00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:15.860
never have enough toilet paper in your house.

5
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.180
International markets have learned something else that we all depend a lot on

6
00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:21.014
China.

7
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.920
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

8
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.830
<v 2>World needs masks. China makes them,</v>

9
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.280
but he's been hoarding them as China grappled with the Corona virus.

10
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.520
It kept the masks it made. Now that other nations need them.

11
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.430
Pressure is rising on Beijing to resume exports.

12
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.130
<v 1>Exactly. After decades of outsourcing production,</v>

13
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.550
we have encountered a shortage of masks in the middle of a pandemic.

14
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.140
So what happened? Well,

15
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.410
the Chinese have been working their socks off in one month.

16
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.830
Comparing in March to April, China was able to multiply its exports.

17
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.830
They doubled the number of respirators and protective suits,

18
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.210
increased mask exports by six times and exports of coronavirus detection kits

19
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.890
were 25 times higher.

20
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.340
We are talking about millions of tons of medical equipment destined for the

21
00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:05.174
international.

22
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.210
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

23
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.710
<v 1>You're probably wondering what does all this mean? Well,</v>

24
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.760
basically we've become too accustomed to our mates and China products.

25
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.180
Most companies don't even think twice every time they set up a new factory,

26
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.360
China is the preferred choice. So why is this the case? Well,

27
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.510
it's partly because everything's cheaper, but that's not the only reason.

28
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.620
China also offers other advantages as built the necessary infrastructure to

29
00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:31.610
export worldwide.

30
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.790
And anyone who wants to manufacture something new is that if they can find good

31
00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:36.560
suppliers and good manufacturers,

32
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.770
it's in China after years of being the world's favorite factory,

33
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.140
Chinese workers are increasingly better skills.

34
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.070
Imagine you want to build an electronics company.

35
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.780
Your best option is to go to shin. Zen.

36
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.510
It's all there you'll find cheaper labor than United States,

37
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.000
but Shang Zen is also the home of the Wang Wang vine,

38
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.180
which is one of the largest markets for electronic components on the planet.

39
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.710
And I'd like to apologize again,

40
00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:03.650
for my terrible pronunciation of many of the places are going to come up in this

41
00:02:03.651 --> 00:02:06.830
video. So you go to Shenzen and you say, hello, good morning.

42
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.890
I'm looking for this next generation controller boards for the true and I want

43
00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:11.000
to build. And before you know it,

44
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.120
you will find a gentleman who sells boards of that type by the kilos.

45
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.600
You can literally see images online of people going to this flea market to buy

46
00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:21.770
bags of microchips. There are a few places on the planet where you can do that.

47
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.100
So it's already clear. China is made for manufacturing.

48
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.520
Of course, when a pandemic arrives,

49
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.160
you see the drawbacks of relying so much on China.

50
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.790
And hold on just one moment because companies must take into account other risks

51
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.720
beyond pandemics. We're talking about politics too, as we all know,

52
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.990
Trump waged a trade war with China, but make no mistake. Trump.

53
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.720
Isn't the only one who wants to stop doing business with Beijing.

54
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.040
Take a look at Japan.

55
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.760
<v 2>Japan set aside 243.5 billion yen to help firms shift production.</v>

56
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.160
Out of, as you can see.

57
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.180
<v 1>In the current environment,</v>

58
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.230
the idea that globalization is a great idea seems to have run its course,

59
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.410
as many feel that China can no longer be trusted and we need to restart

60
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:10.210
production in several countries again,

61
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.700
but once happy world in which we all jetted around the globe,

62
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.140
holding hands and singing kumbaya and ignoring borders. So today's question is,

63
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.140
do they really see it that way in the corporate world are companies thinking of

64
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:22.510
leaving China today? We're going to answer these questions,

65
00:03:22.511 --> 00:03:23.830
but first let's take a look at them.

66
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.073
<v 0>History.</v>

67
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.810
<v 2>Great. Chinese demand.</v>

68
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.780
<v 1>First became a buzzword in the 1990s.</v>

69
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.110
And it wasn't always spoken of favorably because those of you who are more or

70
00:03:37.111 --> 00:03:40.050
less my age, and for those of you that are I'm so very sorry.

71
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.720
You're sure to remember the anti-globalization movement,

72
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.020
the organized large protests in Seattle Prague all around the world.

73
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.340
Why were they protesting?

74
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.880
Let's just say it would be easier to tell you why they weren't protesting.

75
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.990
In a nutshell,

76
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.410
let's just say that these protesters thought the globalization served America's

77
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.950
interests for the rest of the world would simply provide raw materials and cheap

78
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.540
labor to be exploited by money.

79
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.093
<v 0>Nationals.</v>

80
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.240
<v 2>Localization is itself a code word,</v>

81
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.420
a mask for not using the C-word capitalism.

82
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.900
It is a system at the heart of the system is the United States of America.

83
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.760
The world's only existing empire today to Rigali British Pakistani intellectual.

84
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.300
<v 1>And this way the United States would get even richer by exporting his products</v>

85
00:04:21.301 --> 00:04:22.920
and culture all around the world.

86
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.920
We would get to a point where people would lose their very identity to an

87
00:04:25.921 --> 00:04:29.310
insidious capitalism and where they used to eat kebabs with globalization,

88
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.930
they would switch to eating. However,

89
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.740
what we have seen in recent years is something very different. So yes,

90
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.100
the United States economy has continued to grow and it has enormous weight in

91
00:04:41.101 --> 00:04:44.400
the world economy, but it's less and less dominant to give you an idea.

92
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.870
In the 1980s, the U S accounted for about 25% of global GDP now,

93
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.810
and 2020, it doesn't even reach 20%.

94
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.230
And this is good news because it means the rest of the world is growing too.

95
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.220
In fact, we could say that the main symbol of globalization is the kebab camp.

96
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.460
This is a typical meal eaten in the Arab world. And when I was born,

97
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.080
I didn't even know what it was. Now.

98
00:05:04.081 --> 00:05:07.380
It's one more dining option along with pizzas, hamburgers, or sushi.

99
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.830
If the Scottish German Doner kebab franchise is not the epitome of

100
00:05:10.831 --> 00:05:12.400
globalization, please tell me what.

101
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.630
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

102
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.890
<v 2>You are dead brilliant.</v>

103
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.030
The class go from selling 1 million pounds of kebabs a week.

104
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.290
<v 1>We focus now on the economic realm. What happened? Well, yes, it's true.</v>

105
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.260
The first companies that went into China were attracted by cheap labor,

106
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.700
but for many millions of Chinese,

107
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.650
as more and more companies arrived in the country,

108
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.690
companies have had to compete for workers.

109
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.090
And that means that wages are increasing.

110
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.370
They have risen to such degree that for three years,

111
00:05:38.371 --> 00:05:40.140
we've been seeing news headlines like.

112
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.380
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

113
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.800
<v 2>In a wage levels equal to or surpass parts of Europe.</v>

114
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.780
<v 1>Trends that we're seen a long time ago.</v>

115
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.140
Apple closed its last reduction lane in the United States in 2004,

116
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.430
by then most of its product assembly had moved to China. However, by 2013,

117
00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.620
they had began manufacture computers in Texas because the higher wages coupled

118
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:03.530
with higher transportation costs from the Asian country meant China's

119
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:05.960
competitive advantage over the United States was.

120
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.910
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

121
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.740
<v 1>Some of you are probably thinking, okay, good.</v>

122
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.130
So wages are increasing in China and at the same time, factories are leaving.

123
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.600
What disaster is development policy?

124
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.770
Not really because what has happened is that China has also become a market.

125
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:24.430
The goal is no longer to produce goods in China, purely for exports,

126
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.390
but also to sell them a company like Lego has managed to survive the traditional

127
00:06:28.391 --> 00:06:30.940
toy crisis and the competition from the video games industry,

128
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.070
thanks to a seals and the Chinese market.

129
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.580
Everything that'd been lost in the West has been regained in China.

130
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.410
<v 0>Basically.</v>

131
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.590
<v 1>Talking about a market of 1.4 billion, Chinese.</v>

132
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.210
We're making more and more money.

133
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.450
They have more and more one to buy our products. And of course,

134
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.540
keeping China as a market is already incentive enough to keep factories in

135
00:06:52.541 --> 00:06:54.760
China, no matter how much workers, which is rice,

136
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:57.640
because transport costs are also very expensive.

137
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.430
If you have to move tons and tons of your products on a cargo ship,

138
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.620
a transoceanic trip lasting several weeks,

139
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.750
you can imagine that it costs an arm and a leg,

140
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.900
but everything you produce in China can also be sold in China.

141
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.130
You're going to save some logistics.

142
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:13.840
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

143
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.360
<v 1>Not reasonable. Lewin has caused a lot of factories to stay there.</v>

144
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.850
The numbers kind of speak for themselves. And 10 years,

145
00:07:18.851 --> 00:07:23.620
China has gone from exporting 17% of its total production to 9% demand in China

146
00:07:23.621 --> 00:07:24.580
has grown so much.

147
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.060
The company setting up a factory in China would already be viable just for

148
00:07:28.061 --> 00:07:30.730
selling its products in China, but that's not the only reason.

149
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.160
And the last 30 years technology has evolved.

150
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.580
A lot machines are getting better and better at performing more and more

151
00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:37.630
functions automatically.

152
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:38.733
<v 0>Wait.</v>

153
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.290
<v 1>It's going to be a revolutionary change for some industries,</v>

154
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.100
automation and artificial intelligence will transform labor intensive

155
00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:50.830
manufacturing and to capital intensive manufacturing.

156
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.590
This means that it will become increasingly attractive for companies to have a

157
00:07:53.591 --> 00:07:57.850
modern factory with state of the art machinery rather than an outdated factory

158
00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.020
with many workers.

159
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:03.220
So the wage factor will no longer be so important and deciding where to set up

160
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.690
your factory. At this point,

161
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.230
maybe will interest a business owner most is to set up several factories of,

162
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.300
for example, toys at a regional level.

163
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.270
I saved the logistics costs and if labor is more expensive in a particular

164
00:08:13.271 --> 00:08:15.670
region, I could also go with automation. I'm no longer.

165
00:08:15.671 --> 00:08:19.270
So interested in cheap labor as I have at my disposal, good infrastructure,

166
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.110
good suppliers, cheap energy, and highly skilled workers to handle.

167
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:24.453
<v 0>Scenery.</v>

168
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:28.780
<v 1>Visual politic.</v>

169
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.900
We have already talked about 3d printers and additive manufacturing.

170
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:35.260
Not just anyone can do this. You have to have a specialized training.

171
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:38.740
So the last few years, ultimately presenters with an emerging trend,

172
00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:41.050
the regionalization of the value chain,

173
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.510
what is produced in Asia is sold in Asia.

174
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.550
What is produced in America is sold in America.

175
00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:47.560
And what is produced in Europe stays in Europe.

176
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.870
And this trend has only accelerated of course,

177
00:08:49.871 --> 00:08:52.450
with the trade war initiated by the United States.

178
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.100
The Trump administration made having a factory in China for are to be sold in

179
00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:59.610
the United States counter-intuitive. And while we were all busy with this,

180
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.280
the event that changed everything. Alright, and yes,

181
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:04.860
it really has changed everything. Let's take a look at this, right?

182
00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:11.210
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

183
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:14.900
<v 1>Does the name a S M L ring a bell and that's not SMR.</v>

184
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.120
That's a different channel of money and I'll be setting up in the future.

185
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.880
It's a Dutch company, but you've probably never heard of in your life,

186
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.350
but it's fundamental in the world.

187
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:25.910
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

188
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:29.330
<v 1>Dominate the market of the most advanced chip manufacturing through the use of</v>

189
00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:32.420
full Tula graphic machines that make integrated circuits.

190
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.210
ASM L's work is with the world-leading jet producers.

191
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.350
The US-based entail South Korean, Samsung and Taiwanese Taiwan, semiconductor.

192
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.130
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

193
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:43.610
<v 1>Companies,</v>

194
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:48.470
all use components manufactured by ASM L to make motherboards motherboards

195
00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.290
like those used on your phone or mine. So without knowing it,

196
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.660
you probably have an ASL product very close to you.

197
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.540
And given that this is the case, it's time to consider the butterfly.

198
00:09:59.570 --> 00:09:59.780
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

199
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:04.610
<v 2>Just flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil, set off a tornado in Texas,</v>

200
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.590
Edward Lauren's American mathematician.

201
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.130
<v 1>Is what chaos theory is all about unpredictability.</v>

202
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.760
So let's imagine the ASMs has to close for some unforeseen reason.

203
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:17.240
Suddenly smartphone production lanes around the world would start to collapse.

204
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.940
Manufacturers would hold on for as long as their stocks lasted,

205
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.300
but it would soon be a shortage of chips. He's like I'm exaggerating. Well,

206
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.960
something similar actually happened in 2012 and the automotive industry,

207
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:28.340
a fire broke out in Germany,

208
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.940
a factory and Ivanek Ivanek is the world's leading supplier of an essential

209
00:10:31.941 --> 00:10:34.250
resin for braking systems. And at that time,

210
00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.270
the consequences were student felt everyone.

211
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.850
<v 2>Fire and small German town could curb world car production.</v>

212
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.090
<v 1>If there's just one concept that we have to get our heads around this year is</v>

213
00:10:47.091 --> 00:10:49.130
that of the value chain, the supply chain.

214
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.860
We're talking about the whole process in which the various companies and

215
00:10:51.861 --> 00:10:55.280
suppliers possibly from several different countries are involved in production

216
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.280
of goods. And as we mentioned earlier, it's true.

217
00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:01.760
That one problem with global supply chains is that we have probably not achieved

218
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:06.080
100% true globalization when we consider what the terror should really mean.

219
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.150
Because when we say globalization,

220
00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.640
we are actually talking about seeing the United States,

221
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.300
Europe and China trade with each other. We could add Japan, the Asian tigers,

222
00:11:14.301 --> 00:11:16.100
Russia, and that's pretty much effortless.

223
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.750
You might want to add some other Asian countries like Malaysia or Indonesia,

224
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.660
but their numbers are still pretty low. India, for example,

225
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.270
is known for having cheap call centers and excellent,

226
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.070
but cost-effective programmers,

227
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.500
but we rarely see anything that says made in India.

228
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:37.280
The bottom line is that the global supply chain is overly dependent on China on

229
00:11:37.281 --> 00:11:40.310
levels that you cannot even begin to imagine to give you an example.

230
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:44.630
95% of the ibuprofen consumed by the United States comes from.

231
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:45.973
<v 0>Training.</v>

232
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:53.270
<v 2>Rhona virus could cause global medicine shortages as China's factory closures</v>

233
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.820
hit supply chains. Needless.

234
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.300
<v 1>To say,</v>

235
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:59.140
this dependence on China is problematic because its supply chain becomes very

236
00:11:59.141 --> 00:11:59.650
vulnerable.

237
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:03.010
Something like Trump's imposition of tariffs on Chinese steel is going to make

238
00:12:03.011 --> 00:12:04.120
many industries fail,

239
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.240
but where the risk has been most visible has certainly been with the Corona

240
00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.350
virus overnight.

241
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.920
China was totally quarantined and that meant the temporary closure of a lot of

242
00:12:11.921 --> 00:12:12.580
factories.

243
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.670
Some have struggled because they were used to China's production and logistics.

244
00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:19.300
Know-how their good work allowed foreign manufacturers to work with the just

245
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.550
entertain philosophy to reduce expenses.

246
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.440
Managing a large warehouse is more expensive than receiving the products and

247
00:12:28.441 --> 00:12:31.860
immediately distributed them to the stores just in time seeks to reduce

248
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:33.330
inventories to a minimum.

249
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.390
The goal is to have the exact amount of products and the right place at the

250
00:12:36.391 --> 00:12:37.140
right time.

251
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.980
And this is why any factory that shuts down for weeks can cause serious supply

252
00:12:40.981 --> 00:12:41.814
chain problems.

253
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.620
But the Corona virus crisis has also served to demonstrate what's companies have

254
00:12:49.621 --> 00:12:51.960
been able to best survive the Chinese lockdown.

255
00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:55.260
And what some companies have tried to do is compensate for the closure by

256
00:12:55.261 --> 00:12:58.590
increasing production in their other factories and countries like Vietnam.

257
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:05.310
<v 2>Apple has moved some AirPods pro manufacturing from China to Vietnam.</v>

258
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.680
<v 1>Thanks to their factories in Vietnam.</v>

259
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.320
Some have continued to produce despite the Chinese lockdown.

260
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.620
So they were able to put one over their competitors and the business world many

261
00:13:13.621 --> 00:13:17.220
have taken note of this and have come to a conclusion, the concept of China,

262
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:21.300
plus one that is keep your factory in China and produce goods to get the Yuan

263
00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:23.550
from those 1.4 billion Chinese consumers,

264
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:27.870
but also try to set up somewhere else to protect you from any unforeseen events

265
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.130
Before companies are not leaving China completely.

266
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.370
They are simply diversifying with factories and other locations.

267
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.640
What facts does this have on globalization? Well, let's take a look.

268
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.530
<v 2>Real globalization. We.</v>

269
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.030
<v 1>Can sort of say that globalization.</v>

270
00:13:48.031 --> 00:13:51.120
1.0 began when the United States launched the Marshall plan,

271
00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.390
Western Europe had been greatly weakened by destruction during world war II,

272
00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.750
helping your out of the whole, the United States got a top trading partner.

273
00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:01.530
And so it has continued to this day from Asia would come version 2.0 of

274
00:14:01.531 --> 00:14:02.250
globalization,

275
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.640
which is when Japan and the Asian tigers started filling the global market with

276
00:14:05.641 --> 00:14:07.320
their products. When we were all kids,

277
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:09.900
everything was made in Taiwan or made in Japan.

278
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:13.740
But these countries have not only been. Producers are also important consumers,

279
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.860
globalization, 3.0 is what we've seen in recent years.

280
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:18.450
That shift towards trade with.

281
00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:23.880
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

282
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.940
<v 1>The moment when China became the factory of the world and has evolved to produce</v>

283
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.590
goods for its own great demand.

284
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.220
The next step in globalization would be to expand into other countries and steps

285
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.550
are already being taken for that such as how Apple has expanded its production

286
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:39.690
into Vietnam. But stories like that are no longer exceptional, but fashionable.

287
00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.960
Look what the Taiwanese company on height, better known by its trade name,

288
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:46.950
Foxconn the main assembler of the iPhone unintended switch advertisers from its

289
00:14:46.951 --> 00:14:47.850
12 factories.

290
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:52.220
<v 0>In China, pawn high.</v>

291
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.120
<v 2>Expands operations in India, Vietnam amid trade tensions.</v>

292
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.990
<v 1>Especially it goes beyond trade Wars or the Corona virus.</v>

293
00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:02.350
China is going to play a leading role in this new phase of globalization and

294
00:15:02.351 --> 00:15:04.540
this expansion of globalization to other countries.

295
00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.270
There are places that are already becoming China's China.

296
00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:10.930
That is places to which Chinese companies are outsourcing their production.

297
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.010
This will cause China to expand trade ties with countries that will also benefit

298
00:15:15.011 --> 00:15:19.240
from this situation. And yes, we're talking about Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos,

299
00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.010
Bangladesh, and the Philippines,

300
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.190
but also other countries far removed from Beijing.

301
00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.330
<v 2>Shane is turning Ethiopia into a giant fast fashion factory.</v>

302
00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.930
<v 1>Not just that Chinese companies are finding new places to set up their factories</v>

303
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.300
or by encouraging companies to appear in other countries,

304
00:15:37.301 --> 00:15:39.550
to which they are selling machinery to boost the production.

305
00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:43.510
China is also finding new markets for firms that have a lot of competition at

306
00:15:43.511 --> 00:15:45.850
home. This is the case with smartphone manufacturers.

307
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:46.833
<v 0>Transient.</v>

308
00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:53.110
<v 2>Biggest phone seller in Africa is a little known Chinese company.</v>

309
00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:54.250
<v 1>Getting it. This video,</v>

310
00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:57.820
we told you that politicians like Trump or Abbey are pushing companies to leave

311
00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:00.250
China. What is happening is that some may leave,

312
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.670
but everything indicates that the majority are betting on staying in China and

313
00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:06.790
opting for a chain of plus one strategy to reach other markets.

314
00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.480
So it seems that the Corona virus may not change things as much as we expected,

315
00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:11.590
true globalization,

316
00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.770
regionalization of value chains and the China plus one strategy.

317
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.800
These are the trends that are being seen rather than the end.

318
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:19.623
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

319
00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:24.280
<v 1>The question is over to you.</v>

320
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:27.580
Do you think that this new phase of globalization will see all Africans eating

321
00:16:27.581 --> 00:16:28.000
noodles?

322
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.940
Do you think lots of America's time could be just around the corner and more
