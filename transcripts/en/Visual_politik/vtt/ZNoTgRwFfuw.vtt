<v 1>Crystal clear waters,</v>

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.090
endless beaches and passable jungles landscapes that take us to the very heart

4
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.840
of what the word paradise means. My friends, this is the Philippines,

5
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.960
a remote and little known country that has nevertheless had a significant

6
00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:27.680
historical connection with both Spain and somehow with many of Latin America's

7
00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:28.850
Hispanic countries as well.

8
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.233
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

9
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.410
<v 1>This former Spanish colony and Southeast Asia was for more than three centuries</v>

10
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.970
parts of the Spanish empire. Then after the defeat of Spanish troops in 1898,

11
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.560
by those of the United States,

12
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.330
the Philippines were sold to the U S for $20 million with adjustments for

13
00:00:56.331 --> 00:01:01.220
inflation that works out to about $620 million in today's money. Yes,

14
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.760
at that time, the colonies were sold as if they were plots of beachfront land.

15
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.870
Of course, in this case,

16
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.960
the sale and price were practically determined by the United States.

17
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.290
After all they had just won the war and they had the biggest guns

18
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.500
Of course,

19
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.010
far from gaining independence or at least improving its independence with the

20
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:22.970
United States leading the way freedom for Filipinos. Ironically did not come

21
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.780
After being sold to the Americans.

22
00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:31.640
The Philippines was governed by the us for nearly five decades until finally in

23
00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:35.480
1946, the gained their actual independence since then,

24
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.170
the trajectory of this country has not exactly been a bed of roses,

25
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.190
but rather it's been a bunch of thorns, dictatorships, corruption, violence,

26
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.540
drug trafficking, Islamism,

27
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.260
the Philippines manages to bring together a bit of all of the worst problems

28
00:01:48.261 --> 00:01:52.250
that lurk and countries as far away as Venezuela, Honduras, and Pakistan,

29
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.800
and to combat this, no, they have detected

30
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.131
Rodrigo.

31
00:01:58.131 --> 00:02:02.090
Duterte is currently the Philippine president and despite being democratically

32
00:02:02.091 --> 00:02:06.560
elected, let's just say there's little to no sign of democracy. In fact,

33
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.450
it's pretty much the opposite. Check out.

34
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.470
<v 2>Philippine mayor on Duterte narco list shot dead.</v>

35
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.210
The straits times a slaughter them policy that targets the Philippines

36
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.980
poor Al-Jazeera president Rodrigo Duterte war on drugs policy

37
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.670
has led to more than 20,000 deaths since 2016.

38
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.070
<v 1>Okay, so we are talking about full-blown extra judicial executions. In fact,</v>

39
00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:33.350
the Philippine government has actually leaked.

40
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.870
So do you want to know more about this far away country?

41
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.110
Do you want to know more about the dark figure of Rodrigo Duterte?

42
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.690
So if you do and why wouldn't you listen up.

43
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.150
<v 2>The Philippines, a country of the best and worst.</v>

44
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.570
<v 1>First off, this is about to get pretty heavy.</v>

45
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.010
So I think to start off with it would be a good idea. Get to know the country.

46
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:02.110
We're talking about a little better and our,

47
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.800
to tell you that we're talking about a very unusual country. On one hand,

48
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.160
we're talking about the first country in all of Asia to have a constitution

49
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.410
approved by a partially elected Congress.

50
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.250
So a good thing that happened all the way back in the late 19th century and the

51
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:18.820
short periods between the end of Spanish rule and the U S invasion,

52
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.540
there was a short-lived unrecognized Republic known internationally as the

53
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:23.374
Republic.

54
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.630
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

55
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.390
<v 1>Of course, after paying $20 million for these islands,</v>

56
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.140
the Americans were very clear that this territory belonged to them.

57
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.860
So they had no qualms about using all the force necessary to end the

58
00:03:37.861 --> 00:03:41.970
self-proclaimed Republic and the sort of ironic twist that only history can give

59
00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:45.840
us any support for the independence cause was considered a criminal activity by

60
00:03:45.841 --> 00:03:47.850
the U S and in 1906,

61
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.540
American troops arrested and executed members of the last government of the

62
00:03:51.541 --> 00:03:54.750
Republic, including its president general Makarios. A key.

63
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.390
<v 2>Death will come to us all sooner or later.</v>

64
00:03:57.391 --> 00:03:59.940
So I will stand calmly before the Lord almighty,

65
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.200
but I want to tell you that we are not bandaids or thieves as the Americans have

66
00:04:04.201 --> 00:04:08.550
accused us, but members of the revolutionary force that defended our motherland,

67
00:04:08.551 --> 00:04:10.950
the Philippines long-lived democracy,

68
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.370
and hopefully our independence will be reborn in the future.

69
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.820
Long lived the Philippines Makarios soccer. So.

70
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.680
<v 1>The Philippines is an extremely diverse country to give you an idea it's 110</v>

71
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.130
million inhabitants speak 170 different languages.

72
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.090
That is a bigger mess than my teeth. And yet that's not as big as problem,

73
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.260
not by a long.

74
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.690
<v 0>Despite.</v>

75
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.700
<v 1>The fact that up until the coronavirus crisis,</v>

76
00:04:38.701 --> 00:04:42.780
this country had gone 20 years without suffering a single quarter of negative

77
00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:45.150
growth. And even though over the last decade,

78
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.700
the average economic growth has been almost 6% per year.

79
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.520
The Philippines remains a very poor country,

80
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.510
a country where the majority of the population remains anchored in absolute

81
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.110
poverty.

82
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.910
This is a country where the average salary is just over $200 per month.

83
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.020
And we're one of the main sources of wealth is the nearly $30 billion.

84
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.040
The more than 12 million Filipinos around the world transfer and remittances to

85
00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:08.874
their families.

86
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.183
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

87
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.510
<v 1>If we consider the problems that the government has controlling a country made</v>

88
00:05:15.511 --> 00:05:20.250
up of more than 7,000 islands per infrastructure on 170 different languages,

89
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.390
then we faint.

90
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.410
It is the perfect breeding ground for the emergence of non-recommended

91
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.273
activities.

92
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.910
<v 0>So.</v>

93
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.380
<v 1>Visual politics, poverty,</v>

94
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.130
and lack of control by the government and the legal system over a large part of

95
00:05:35.131 --> 00:05:36.630
the country has made the Philippines.

96
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.800
One of the biggest Asian epicenters for human trafficking and also for drug

97
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:41.310
trafficking.

98
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.820
The Philippines is not only the largest consumer of methamphetamines and

99
00:05:44.821 --> 00:05:48.540
marijuana in Eastern Asia, but also its largest producer.

100
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.630
And do you know where most of the cocktails operating in the country come from,

101
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.400
they come from China and you can get an idea of what this might entail.

102
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.330
And other countries where these mafias exist,

103
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.650
violence and lack of security are a huge problem around all of these narcotic

104
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.880
mafias. A whole web of illegal economies have also been created dedicated to the

105
00:06:09.881 --> 00:06:10.870
trafficking of people,

106
00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.800
organs smuggling of all kinds and practically any other criminal activity that

107
00:06:14.801 --> 00:06:16.180
you can think of. Of course,

108
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.590
going hand in hand with this corruption is almost institutionalized as one more

109
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.903
economic.

110
00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.250
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

111
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.420
<v 1>As you can probably imagine.</v>

112
00:06:25.421 --> 00:06:29.290
Poverty has forced many families to have to throw themselves into the arms of

113
00:06:29.291 --> 00:06:31.990
one of the many underworld groups operating in the country.

114
00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.450
And it is against this backdrop as we shall see,

115
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.010
but the figure of Duterte arises a present basically characterized by two

116
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.050
things, a heavy hand as an,

117
00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.520
a very hard lane against grain and promises of economic growth for the latter.

118
00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.100
He means to clear the deck and switch strategic.

119
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.993
<v 0>Partners.</v>

120
00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.950
<v 1>For many years, the Philippines had been very close to the United States,</v>

121
00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:00.640
obviously so much so that Washington has come to classify its relationship with

122
00:07:00.641 --> 00:07:02.230
the Philippines as special.

123
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.220
And the nation is considered one of its most important strategic allies in Asia,

124
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.100
along with countries, such as Taiwan, South Korea, or Thailand

125
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.220
As president Duterte, his arrival in 2016,

126
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.910
the Manila Washington access has been increasingly veering to Beijing,

127
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:20.170
especially over the past.

128
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.930
<v 0>Look. And you can see what changed. There has been.</v>

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:38.430
Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte says he needs China loves CGMP,

CNN. I mean China, more than anybody else at this point, I need China.

133
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.980
I simply love CGM ping. He understood.

134
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.190
He understands my problem and is willing to help. So I would say thank you,

135
00:07:48.191 --> 00:07:50.710
tryna Rodrigo Duterte, president of the Philippines.

136
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.620
<v 1>All else do territory wants money, investment,</v>

137
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:57.310
and as much Chinese capital as possible to lift the country's economy.

138
00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.040
He couldn't be more transparent about it. Check this.

139
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:04.510
<v 2>Our destiny lies in Asia, not in the middle East, as they're too busy fighting,</v>

140
00:08:04.511 --> 00:08:06.670
and they don't have any money. And if you don't have money,

141
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.940
you're not my friend. So I go to China, plenty of money, president Duterte,

142
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.800
are you kidding?

143
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.680
<v 1>Just surprised at such sincerity because honestly you probably shouldn't be</v>

144
00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.230
Duterte as anything, but a normal president.

<v 0>And.</v>

146
00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.710
<v 1>In a way it is quite logical that he should get along better with dictators like</v>

147
00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:27.880
Zhang Peng than with the leaders of Western democracies. So what's the reason,

148
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:28.743
well, wasn't it.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:35.140

<v 2>The toughest resident.</v>

151
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.920
<v 1>If anything has characterized Rodrigo Duterte since the beginning of his</v>

152
00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:46.150
presidency is that he is the president who speaks plainly and who does not mess

153
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:49.420
around. Let's just say that if we were talking about scruples,

154
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.730
he has absolutely none.

155
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.860
He is willing to do whatever it takes to fight not only trafficking and

156
00:08:55.861 --> 00:08:59.730
criminals, but also his own political adversaries. In fact,

his harsh ways of [inaudible] fame around the world for being a dictator and a

Don't test the government Rodrigo Duterte.

167
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:34.520
<v 1>So two days after these statements,</v>

168
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.690
a sexy three-year-old farmer was shot by police for not wearing a mask.

169
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.920
According to the agents, the man threatened them with a safe proportionality.

170
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.440
What the hell is that? Anyway, and there's environment.

171
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.980
There has been an increase in shootings of civilians by police across the

172
00:09:48.981 --> 00:09:52.490
country. Something that is not covered up at all by law enforcement.

173
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.340
<v 2>And he went out at the wrong time will be shot.</v>

174
00:09:55.341 --> 00:09:58.820
You sons of Philippine police officer in a radio report.

175
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.360
<v 1>And that is not all following the government's own orders.</v>

176
00:10:02.361 --> 00:10:06.140
And some municipalities people who were caught skipping curfews have been locked

177
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.800
in dog cages and other places punishments have also been applied that could

178
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:13.400
easily be mistaken for torture. Of course, this kind of thing.

179
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:14.533
Didn't start with.

180
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:15.643
<v 0>Virus.</v>

181
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.110
<v 1>You texted him as a guy who simply does not believe in reintegration,</v>

182
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.900
according to him, as he has expressed many times,

183
00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:28.190
those who commit crimes are nothing more than expendable social waste.

184
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:32.600
That is precisely why Duterte established a zero tolerance policy against drug

185
00:10:32.601 --> 00:10:36.140
traffickers and narcotics consumers. Since his arrival in power,

186
00:10:36.141 --> 00:10:37.790
he has also ordered a shoot.

187
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:39.613
<v 0>Policy.</v>

188
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.460
<v 1>Look, consider this for just one moment,</v>

189
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.510
despite all of this being a clear violation of the most basic human rights,

190
00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.130
what the Philippines has experienced.

191
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.160
It tells us that this tough approach is not the best way to fake crane.

192
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:56.060
And what did he already has done is simply to set in motion a whole machinery of

193
00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:00.410
extra judicial executions as given the police many public officials and their

194
00:11:00.411 --> 00:11:03.950
own government, the ability to get rid of people with total impunity.

195
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.700
And this is in a country with very high levels of corruption. And.

196
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.920
<v 0>Let me.</v>

197
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.240
<v 1>Ask you a simple question. Would you dare and an environment like this,</v>

198
00:11:14.241 --> 00:11:17.810
oppose the government or denounced the wheelings and dealings of for example,

199
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.670
a corrupt police officer. I bet.

200
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:23.840
<v 0>Yes.</v>

201
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.180
<v 1>Since the first zero tolerance policy was launched,</v>

202
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.700
or perhaps we should call that the zero legality policy,

203
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:33.230
at least 6,600 people are estimated to have lost their lives in the

204
00:11:33.231 --> 00:11:36.470
Philippines, according to the police. However, that number,

205
00:11:36.471 --> 00:11:37.490
according to human rights,

206
00:11:37.491 --> 00:11:42.440
watch goes all the way up to 27,000 people to top it all off.

207
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:46.310
Many of those people had nothing to do with drug trafficking or mafias or any

208
00:11:46.311 --> 00:11:47.480
criminal activity at all,

209
00:11:47.481 --> 00:11:50.390
but they were simply people who were caught in the crossfire or corruption or

210
00:11:50.391 --> 00:11:51.770
for some other reasons.

211
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:54.940
<v 0>So.</v>

212
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.720
<v 1>At this point, how do you think that Philippine residents rate their presidents?</v>

213
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.120
Well, contrary to what you might think, Rodrigo Duterte,

214
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.280
his popularity is around AC that's right.

215
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.130
80% is a little bit less than complete favor,

216
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.460
but how on earth can a guy like that achieve these levels of.

217
00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:13.410
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

218
00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:17.520
<v 1>May seem hard to accept and our culture, but a nation hit by crane, narcotics,</v>

219
00:12:17.521 --> 00:12:21.180
trafficking, human trafficking and poverty. It's no wonder that for many people,

220
00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:24.810
things like freedom and human rights are left far in the background. Indeed.

221
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:29.850
According to polls, only 15% of residents consider democracy to be essential.

222
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:31.230
And even for us in the West,

223
00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.920
some of this might be starting to send creepily familiar in the end.

224
00:12:34.950 --> 00:12:38.640
What we have already seen happen many other times happens despair,

225
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:42.600
disappointment and corruption are often the best ways to feed authoritarian.

226
00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.063
<v 0>Leaders.</v>

227
00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:46.740
<v 1>Anyway, it's your turn.</v>

228
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.710
Now as a president like Duterte entitled to pass on human rights,

229
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:50.900
even if he pursues an end,

230
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.030
that theoretically could be good as the fight against crime,

231
00:12:54.031 --> 00:12:55.560
more important than the law and justice.

232
00:12:55.561 --> 00:12:58.980
Do you think you would like someone like Duterte in your country before I say to

233
00:12:58.981 --> 00:13:01.020
