and they will have a range of colors too. Um,

9
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.780
what I'd loving about them is the seamless Bluetooth pairing.

So I can easily listen to podcasts and audio books when I'm on the go. Now,

11

<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

23
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.290
<v 0>If there is one thing that characterizes the extreme East of Asia,</v>

24
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.590
it has been the recent power struggle between different political and military

25
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:34.100
players, such as China, Russia, and the United States. And of course,

26
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.810
if there has ever been one country,

27
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.950
one nation of people that has always been in the midst of so much geopolitical

28
00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:40.550
turbulence,

29
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.600
whether in the Soviet era or in the age of a rapidly modernizing China,

30
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.100
it has to be career

31
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.580
The people of Korea who have historically been forced to survive between the

32
00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:56.090
influences of the Chinese empire and the expansionist aspirations of the

33
00:01:56.091 --> 00:02:00.830
Japanese empire are today divided into two ideologically opposed countries,

34
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.730
each supported by rivaling superpowers with a lot of tension and enormous

35
00:02:04.731 --> 00:02:05.780
distrust between them.

36
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.770
All of this has led to the two careers to make their armed forces a national

37
00:02:09.771 --> 00:02:13.910
priority. Today, as you will know, North Korea, possesses nuclear weapons,

38
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.610
and relatively advanced ballistic missile technology,

39
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.270
as well as thousands and thousands of pieces of artillery for its part.

40
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.140
South Korea has one of the best technologically equipped armies in the world

41
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.800
with a very advanced air force and one of the most advanced anti-missile

42
00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:29.630
protection systems in existence.

43
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.020
However, despite the fact that both careers are arms to the hilt,

44
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.520
the truth is that these days are new armed confrontation between the two seems

45
00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:41.354
unlikely.

46
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.140
And unlike other cases where calm has been achieved through diplomatic means

47
00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:49.070
today's tense.

48
00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:53.570
Peace on the Korean peninsula is almost exclusively the results of military

49
00:02:53.571 --> 00:02:58.250
deterrence, neither the Trump and Kim Jong urn summits in Singapore and Hanoi,

50
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.520
nor the meetings moon Jae in and Kim in Panmunjom and Pyongyang have served to

51
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:07.960
substantially improve things in Korea. The diplomatic route is simply frozen.

52
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.020
We are talking about a scenario in which the two main actors,

53
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.960
one of them in particular, of course, I'm talking about North Korea.

54
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.760
I run able to give up a shred of political diplomatic or military ground to the

55
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:19.450
other side.

56
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.350
The fact is that the United States has not found a way for Pyongyang to dispose

57
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:25.090
of its nuclear weapons. And of course,

58
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.290
North Korea cannot afford to give up its nuclear weapons because the survival of

59
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:33.190
the regime itself depends on them. And then despite its many attempts,

60
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.940
South Korea has been unable to promote reforms in the North that would allow for

61
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:39.580
the lifting of sanctions and economic cooperation.

62
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.700
So what is left to do faced with such a mess,

63
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.040
exactly military deterrence,

64
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.640
that is to be strong enough so that the other side does not even remotely

65
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.330
consider going down the path of an armed attack to achieve its goals and

66
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:55.240
friends. That is precisely what we are going to look at in this video. But no,

67
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.330
this time we are not going to tell you about the North Korean army.

68
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.300
I'm sure you've heard 1,001 things about it.

69
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.740
So this time we're going to talk about the much lesser known South Korean army,

70
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.330
which by various estimates is the sixth most powerful army in the world.

71
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.650
Listen up. Oh, by the way,

72
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.130
we wanted to let you know that we've launched a new history channel visual

73
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:17.290
Academy. I'll leave the link in the description.

74
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.510
It is totally different to this channel. And sadly,

75
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:21.970
there are no bald guys or Hawaiian shirts,

76
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:25.060
but if you want history presented to you in a fresh way,

77
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.910
I think you might like it. Let us know in the comments, what you think.

78
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.833
And I'll see you there.

79
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.240
<v 1>The American shield.</v>

80
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.870
<v 0>Friends of visual politic the evolution of the South Korean military has been</v>

81
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.100
almost as successful as the country's own economic miracle in just one decade.

82
00:04:47.101 --> 00:04:51.030
It has gone from being little more than Pancho's Villa's army to one of the most

83
00:04:51.031 --> 00:04:54.510
advanced in the world. As you can imagine, they did not get there on their own.

84
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.570
In this case, the United States played a key role.

85
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.730
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

86
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.180
<v 0>After the end of the Korean war in 1954,</v>

87
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.140
the defense of South Korea was technically left in the hands of the United

88
00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.250
States, which commanded OpCon the acronym for operational control.

89
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.970
During the war, the South Koreans had used up all their military resources.

90
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.960
The exhaustion together with the shortage of modern equipment made it impossible

91
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.420
for the American power to withdraw completely,

92
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.260
which under the circumstances would have left the country unprotected and

93
00:05:25.261 --> 00:05:28.560
vulnerable to bits, communist, neighbors, China, and North Korea.

94
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.510
So what they did was stay and train instruct and prepare the South Korean

95
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.351
army. In fact,

96
00:05:34.351 --> 00:05:37.560
much of the design of the South Korean military structures was done by

97
00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:41.790
replicating, or at least was clearly inspired by the model of the S.

98
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.953
<v 1>Forces.</v>

99
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.320
<v 0>Not only gaps in order to compensate for North Korea's bolstering of arms,</v>

100
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.520
the United States also deployed some of its most important strategic weapons in

101
00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:56.670
South Korea. These included the dreaded nuclear weapons.

102
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.400
Late 1950s, the United States began moving numerous nuclear warheads into Korea.

103
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.300
They reached almost a thousand units by the mid 1960s. However,

104
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.700
as the cold war faded away on the one hand,

105
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.330
the relations between Washington and Beijing continued to improve on the other,

106
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.410
this powerful arsenal was gradually reduced. So that by 1991,

107
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.580
there were no more us nuclear warheads permanently deployed in South Korea.

108
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.730
And exactly the same thing happened with the deployment of us troops.

109
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.340
The number of which was gradually reduced, but of course,

110
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.510
all those years of South Korea being completely under the U S military umbrella

111
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.500
gave the country time to improve its military capabilities. For example,

112
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.460
president puck Chung,

113
00:06:39.461 --> 00:06:43.600
he himself launched an ambitious program known as yell Ngoc in the

114
00:06:43.601 --> 00:06:46.810
1970s to boost an indigenous military industry.

115
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.920
But it was not only a question of the quantity of weapons if they really wanted

116
00:06:50.921 --> 00:06:54.490
to be self-sufficient in the military field and guarantee national security,

117
00:06:54.491 --> 00:06:56.530
regardless of decisions made in Washington,

118
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.110
South Koreans needed state-of-the-art equipment,

119
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:00.700
rapid intervention capabilities,

120
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.420
and new structures adapted to the requirements of modern warfare.

121
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.580
And that is precisely what they did.

122
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.043
<v 1>Not</v>

123
00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.070
change. Of course.

124
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.140
<v 0>That the South Korean military has faced over the past 40 years has been to move</v>

125
00:07:23.141 --> 00:07:27.310
from being a virtually land-based force to one that is much more balanced in its

126
00:07:27.311 --> 00:07:30.640
defense of the air and the sea as well. For this purpose,

127
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.850
three military reforms were implemented one in 2005,

128
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.890
another in 2011 and the last one in 2017 by current president moon Jae in

129
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.000
with these reforms,

130
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.640
the goal has been to substantially reduce the size of the army,

131
00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.790
but at the same time to turn it into a much more fearsome force,

132
00:07:45.791 --> 00:07:47.410
better equipped, better trained,

133
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:52.000
able to be deployed more efficiently and made up of better land sea and air

134
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.790
units achieving a total ratio of two to one.

135
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:55.893
<v 1>To one.</v>

136
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.940
<v 0>Many of these reforms have been carried out or implemented to a large extent.</v>

137
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.050
The OpCon the body that would have military control in times of war has not been

138
00:08:08.051 --> 00:08:11.440
transferred and still remains under the direction of the United States.

139
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:12.160
And in fact,

140
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.540
the last of the three military reforms that of the current president moon called

141
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:17.321
defense reform,

142
00:08:17.321 --> 00:08:22.300
2.0 is oriented to improve South Korea capacities against the North Korean

143
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.350
asymmetric war.

144
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:28.360
And also to finally achieving the transfer of the OpCon to South Korea in times

145
00:08:28.361 --> 00:08:28.840
of war.

146
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.410
But the fact is that efforts so far have focused primarily on completing the

147
00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:36.100
development of three key strategies against current North Korean threats,

148
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:40.090
the preventative kill chain system, the Korean air and missile defense,

149
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.230
K a M D,

150
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:46.150
and the Korea massive punishment and retaliation KMP are all three, by the way,

151
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.810
our combat strategies aimed at the Terrance and take notes because this is

152
00:08:49.811 --> 00:08:51.850
something that South Koreans are taking very,

153
00:08:51.851 --> 00:08:53.710
very seriously without going any further.

154
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:58.500
President moon's intention to achieve a 53% increase in military spending

155
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.840
between 2017 and 2023,

156
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:04.800
thus going from a budget of around $30 billion a year to one that exits

157
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:06.300
$50 billion. Now,

158
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.290
what exactly do all these changes imply in terms of armament? Well,

159
00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:11.243
let's take a look.

160
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.970
<v 1>The crown jewels.</v>

161
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.330
<v 0>We're talking about military equipment. We can say that South Korea has,</v>

162
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.960
or is buying some of the best military equipment in the world.

163
00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:34.280
And we're not just talking about, well, let's call it traditional equipment.

164
00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:39.080
In addition to the approximately 2,500 tanks, 2,400 armored vehicles,

165
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.180
5,400 pieces of artillery,

166
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:46.130
or more than 150 modern fighters that make up the South Korean war inventory.

167
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:50.300
We must also add advanced equipment in missile defense and ballistic to

168
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.610
Terrance. And also during recent years,

169
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.540
the country has been negotiating the acquisition of fifth generation fighter.

170
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.060
<v 1>We are.</v>

171
00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:02.780
<v 0>For example,</v>

172
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:07.580
about the American F 35 stealth fighter of which South Korea will have 80 units,

173
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:10.940
60 a version a and 20 a version B version, by the way,

174
00:10:10.941 --> 00:10:13.850
which boasts vertical takeoff capability. In addition,

175
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.560
the Korean aerospace company,

176
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.070
Kai is developing its own fifth generation fighter jet.

177
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:23.150
Also very similar to the F 35 currently called K F X.

178
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.270
The intention of this program is that the capabilities of this aircraft will

179
00:10:26.271 --> 00:10:30.620
greatly exceed those of the European Eurofighter or the French Dassault

180
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:31.880
Rafale for example,

181
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.070
Not just in the air where there is news.

182
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:41.330
The South Korean Navy is engaged in a program of building and acquiring new

183
00:10:41.331 --> 00:10:45.290
submarines. That includes the development of a new indigenous class,

184
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.630
the Jang BOGO three class summary.

185
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:52.100
It is also incorporating destroyers equipped with the ages combat system and

186
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:56.300
light aircraft carriers from which it will be able to deploy at the F 35,

187
00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:57.201
but undoubtedly,

188
00:10:57.201 --> 00:11:00.860
the most insignificant military advances are taking place in the field of

189
00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:01.880
missile defense.

190
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.350
It's Korea has already developed a low level missile umbrella using Patriot

191
00:11:09.351 --> 00:11:11.660
missile batteries that make up a pack two system,

192
00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:15.200
a system that South Korea seems certain to upgrade to pack three,

193
00:11:15.201 --> 00:11:18.770
to make it much more accurate and responsive to short and medium range.

194
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.670
Missile attacks.

195
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:25.310
<v 2>Three uses a two pulse solid rocket motor that increases the altitude and range</v>

196
00:11:25.311 --> 00:11:29.240
to defend against evolving threats so that the newer missile interceptors are

197
00:11:29.241 --> 00:11:33.710
expected to be useful in thwarting. The North's new type of missile threats,

198
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.280
South Korean ministry of defense official on condition of anonymity.

199
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.500
<v 0>Another high level anti-missile shield is also deployed the famous and</v>

200
00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:44.270
controversial us fart,

201
00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:48.710
which aims to protect the country from Intercontinental or large missiles,

202
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.140
which fly at much higher altitudes.

203
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.970
But without a doubt to the most striking is South Korea's effort to become

204
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.600
independent and create a third anti-missile shield.

205
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.680
This time made himself to Rhea. And we are talking about Shalma too.

206
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.400
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

207
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.430
<v 0>System uses the Russian intersection technology of its famous S 400,</v>

208
00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:14.280
wait a minute, Russian technology in South Korea. Yes,

209
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:17.940
the United States refuses to sell this type of technology to third parties,

210
00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:20.220
even if they are such important allies.

211
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.130
So the South Koreans have had to turn to the Russians.

212
00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.310
The missiles with this system are being developed by the South Korean company

213
00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:30.450
league. Next one. And despite having a unit cost of $1.2 million,

214
00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.870
the truth is that the South Korean system challenged the two aims to become one

215
00:12:33.871 --> 00:12:36.210
of the cheapest anti-missile shields in the world.

216
00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.960
It has even plans to be exported to other Southeast Asian countries.

217
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.500
And although it does not offer the same range as other anti-missile systems,

218
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:47.880
the idea of the South Korean authorities is to take advantage of its low cost to

219
00:12:47.881 --> 00:12:51.930
deploy it throughout the country, fast, creating a real iron dome.

220
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.770
The system is capable of intercepting missiles up to 15 kilometers high and

221
00:12:55.771 --> 00:12:58.380
within a 40 kilometer range where the battery,

222
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.530
The fact is that in this way,

223
00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.000
South Korea will foreseeably have from 2021 onwards, not one,

224
00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:13.650
not two but three anti-missile systems that will protect the country from North

225
00:13:13.651 --> 00:13:17.400
Korean frets. However, a lot of people are wondering is all of this enough.

226
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:21.360
Well, that is the debate. And what is certain is that there is no consensus,

227
00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:22.680
many military experts,

228
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:26.640
and even former South Korean ministers have gone so far as to call for going

229
00:13:26.641 --> 00:13:30.570
further and developing nuclear weapons off their own once and for all,

230
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.350
but is it reasonable for South Korea to develop its own nuclear weapons?

231
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:38.130
Is it militarily possible? Is it politically and diplomatically possible?

232
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:38.993
Listen up.

233
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:49.080
<v 1>A nuclear solution. Okay.</v>

234
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:51.180
<v 0>This may not sound familiar to many of you,</v>

235
00:13:51.181 --> 00:13:55.500
but South Korea's nuclear program is not something farfetched or even something

236
00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:59.430
that hasn't already been tried. In fact, in the early 1970s,

237
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.670
despite the fact that there were already us nuclear warheads in Korea,

238
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.930
president puck, he launched an indigenous nuclear weapons development program,

239
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.630
the program, however, remained in the research phase.

240
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.080
And although it is believed that South Korea gained the knowledge necessary to

241
00:14:13.081 --> 00:14:14.610
manufacture a nuclear weapon,

242
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.640
the truth is that no device was ever produced or tested there.

243
00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:19.320
So why did the program stop?

244
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.180
<v 1>Basically.</v>

245
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.180
<v 0>It was due to pressure from the United States, which was a game,</v>

246
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.730
this nuclear proliferation in Korea from the beginning,

247
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:33.900
they finally managed to dissuade park from stopping the program and signing the

248
00:14:33.901 --> 00:14:36.600
non-proliferation treaty in 1975.

249
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:40.440
However many analysts believe that South Korea conducted occasional experiments

250
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.510
over the next few years in secret.

251
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.170
And that today they would be capable of building a nuclear bomb in no more than

252
00:14:46.171 --> 00:14:50.520
18 months, that would make it in fact, a de facto nuclear state,

253
00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:53.450
a status it would share with countries like Japan.

254
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.800
And of course over the past few years,

255
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:02.330
especially after the latest North Korean nuclear tests in 2016 and 2017,

256
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.170
there have been numerous voices in South Korea calling for a return to the

257
00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:10.250
indigenous nuclear weapons program. In fact, according to a September, 2017,

258
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.000
Gallup poll,

259
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.110
60% of South Koreans would support the development of their own nuclear weapons.

260
00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:15.973
In addition,

261
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.130
South Korea is most nationalistic and conservative factions believe that they

262
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.460
can no longer depend on the United States for strategic defense.

263
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.820
As the Trump presidency has shown that either you are capable of defending

264
00:15:25.821 --> 00:15:27.830
yourself, or you could have a Hong Kong.

265
00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:28.773
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

266
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.070
<v 0>Unlike other presidents,</v>

267
00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.840
Trump has been the least friendly by far to those who may be his best allies in

268
00:15:37.841 --> 00:15:39.640
East Asia. Trump.

269
00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.510
<v 2>Ignites cost sharing dispute with South Korea VOA,</v>

270
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.460
we lose four and a half billion dollars to defend a country that's rich as hell.

271
00:15:48.461 --> 00:15:51.820
And probably doesn't like us too much. President Trump. Yes.

272
00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.013
<v 0>That's right.</v>

273
00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.710
Trump unleashed a whole diplomatic dispute with South Korea to get the country

274
00:15:56.711 --> 00:15:58.660
to pay more money to the United States,

275
00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:00.730
to offset the costs of troops stationed there.

276
00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.730
And Trump did in fact manage to get another billion dollars out of president

277
00:16:03.731 --> 00:16:06.070
moon. Something that he even brazenly scoffed at.

278
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.600
<v 2>It was easier to get a billion dollars from South Korea than to get</v>

279
00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:16.240
$114 and 13 cents from a rent controlled apartment in Brooklyn, president Trump.

280
00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:16.970
<v 0>Of course,</v>

281
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:20.920
given the hostility to South Korea demonstrated by Trump during his presidency.

282
00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:24.820
Many wonder whether South Korea with the military and economic means it has,

283
00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:28.360
should continue to depend on the Americans for its strategic defense.

284
00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:30.880
And for this reason, nuclear weapons have returned to the debate.

285
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.590
Although president moon has already said,

286
00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:35.860
this is not something that will happen during his presidency even.

287
00:16:35.861 --> 00:16:39.820
So what do you think should South Korea guarantee its nuclear deterrence

288
00:16:39.821 --> 00:16:44.410
capacity in the face of the North Korean threat and the latest us rampage after

289
00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:48.520
rural North Korea already has nuclear weapons and has zero intention of getting

290
00:16:48.521 --> 00:16:50.200
rid of them. So why not South Korea?

291
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.410
Wouldn't it be more practical to develop nuclear weapons of their own instead of

292
00:16:53.411 --> 00:16:56.380
having nearly 25,000 us soldiers on the ground,

293
00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.740
which generates high costs for both countries or on the contrary,

294
00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:03.970
would this merely create a diplomatic problem and fuel the conflict with North

295
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:06.640
Korea? Anyway, these are not easy questions to answer,

296
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.520
but that's the way things stand on the Korean peninsula.
