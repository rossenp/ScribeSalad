00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.170
<v 0>This video is sponsored by Finnama is in this day and age,</v>

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.070
we all know that we should be working smarter, getting our money to work for us.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.210
But if you're anything like me,

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.300
that seems like a lot of time and a pretty long term commitment.

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.840
So how can we keep up with what's happening in the world of investing or more

6
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:17.490
basically, where do you start?

7
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.890
If you're completely new to the world of investing? Well,

8
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.700
this video is sponsored by [inaudible] and they can really help you with that

9
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.370
for demise is an app that was designed,

10
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.810
particularly with young busy people in mind.

11
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.200
The idea is to give you the information and tools you need to invest with

12
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.280
confidence and eventually empower you to become your own financial advisor.

13
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.170
We've been playing around with it for a couple of days.

14
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:40.770
So let me just share a few of the features with you. So as you'd expect,

15
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.310
they have the financial news packaged in the daily brief. Here,

16
00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:48.420
you have options of text or audio summaries that you can easily digest on your

17
00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:51.510
commute, or whilst you're walking the dock, but when you want to go deeper,

18
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.910
they also have these 100 plus packs.

19
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.370
I know that research was often a stumbling block for me.

20
00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.220
It's just so time-consuming. But with these packs,

21
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.180
you really get a comprehensive outline of top industries or companies that you

22
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:06.630
may be looking at. Another thing I liked was the chat function,

23
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.660
where you can ask questions to others in the [inaudible] community.

24
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.890
And once you find your feet,

25
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.850
there are Q and a sessions with investing pros and analysts to in a nutshell,

26
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.540
Finnama is brings the biggest financial news and professional insights to young

27
00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:22.860
investors in language people actually understand that's demystifying approach

28
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.020
carries over into the user experience as well.

29
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.900
I found their design really good and uncluttered overall.

30
00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:31.140
It's a great tool for providing easy to digest, investing knowledge,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.530
So check it out [inaudible] and now let's get into our video.

38
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.593
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

39
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.360
<v 0>Coronavirus to pandemic is having a strong impact on economies around the world.</v>

40
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.170
And therefore that impact is also taking its toll on the productive fabric,

41
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.570
Greater or lesser extent.

42
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.290
The vast majority of companies are experiencing a more than considerable

43
00:02:15.291 --> 00:02:19.790
negative impact, decreased sales, lower margins, and a collapse in profits.

44
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.030
<v 1>In fact.</v>

45
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.990
<v 0>It's the rate of business failures is the fastest since 2013 in the old</v>

46
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:27.860
continent alone,

47
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.280
the European commission has calculated that the cost of the pandemic to

48
00:02:31.281 --> 00:02:35.390
businesses could exceed 700 billion euros just for 2020.

49
00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.570
Don't think that on the other side of the pond, the situation is different.

50
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.040
<v 1>Not at all without looking too.</v>

51
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.170
<v 0>We have the case of the car rental company hurts a company that did not sustain</v>

52
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.230
the onslaught of the coronavirus and had to declare bankruptcy.

53
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.560
So let's take a moment because their problems were not exclusively due to the

54
00:02:57.561 --> 00:02:58.910
direct hit of the coronavirus.

55
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.100
What happened was that the company simply could not escape a huge pile of debt

56
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.840
of over $17 billion.

57
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.050
And of course it is by no means the only example that we can.

58
00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.323
<v 1>Fine.</v>

59
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.070
<v 0>Corporate debt is becoming a major concern,</v>

60
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.310
a concern that has led the United States government itself together with the

61
00:03:17.311 --> 00:03:21.930
federal reserve to intervene massively in 2020 to ensure the liquidity of the

62
00:03:21.931 --> 00:03:22.460
productive.

63
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.880
<v 1>Fabric, to give you an idea.</v>

64
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.120
<v 0>Among other measures, the us federal government put on the table, a</v>

65
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.920
$500 billion small business loan program at the same time that the federal

66
00:03:34.921 --> 00:03:38.820
reserve announced its intention to buy $750 billion. Of course.

67
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.650
<v 1>Of course.</v>

68
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.590
<v 0>In addition to the risk of public outcry that this may pose,</v>

69
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.640
this strategy offers no solution that goes beyond the most immediate problems

70
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.470
after all in the medium term,

71
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.590
it seems difficult to think that more debt is in itself,

72
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.550
a solution for companies whose problem was excess debt in the first place.

73
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.310
<v 2>Many companies face solve and see risks that are not corrected through debt</v>

74
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.450
over-indebtedness cannot be cured by more debt, no matter how cheap it is.

75
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.350
Excerpt from an August, 2020 report by Braven Howard hedge fund.

76
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.710
<v 0>We are talking about an aftermath to the pandemic that could cause many,</v>

77
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.120
many problems in the future.

78
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.840
Will this be the next crisis we face take note because many analysts share this

79
00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:23.670
concern such as bill Ackman,

80
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.720
the well-known founder and manager of Pershing square capital management after

81
00:04:27.721 --> 00:04:32.070
preempting the coronavirus in March and reaping a profit of $2.6 billion with an

82
00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:35.820
operation that involved paying a premium of just $27 million in insurance

83
00:04:35.821 --> 00:04:39.750
policies against default, he has set his focus squarely on corporate debt.

84
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.950
<v 2>Ackman places, new bet against corporate credit.</v>

85
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.170
<v 0>And this new video made in collaboration with our friends from a value score.</v>

86
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.370
We give you all the details.

87
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.420
<v 1>A huge stock of debt.</v>

88
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.590
<v 0>At the end of October, 2019,</v>

89
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.290
the international monetary fund issued a strong warning.

90
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.160
If no action was taken urgent measures would risk a new financial crisis in the

91
00:05:05.161 --> 00:05:08.820
business sector, a new crisis that could in turn spreads to the bank.

92
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.893
<v 1>Think sector.</v>

93
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.960
<v 0>According to the IMF itself, nearly $19 trillion of corporate debt.</v>

94
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.040
Most of it owned by us companies could be vulnerable in the event of a material

95
00:05:20.041 --> 00:05:23.850
slowdown in the economy. Yes, it is true that over the last few years,

96
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.640
debt has been cheap, but there is a lot of liquidity in the markets.

97
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.030
And also that interest unlike dividends is deductible. However,

98
00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.200
crises often have the capacity to make debt radioactive when income collapses

99
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.290
interest begins to weigh more and more heavily on the income statement.

100
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.600
And obviously those due dates become a nightmare.

101
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.410
It's precisely what led to the IMF to issue that harsh warning.

102
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.100
At the end of 2019 back before the Corona virus pandemic hit the world economy.

103
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.630
<v 1>And friends.</v>

104
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.640
<v 0>Obviously the business closures lockdowns and have caused many companies,</v>

105
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:02.210
revenues and results to plummet this in turn has forced them to run to the

106
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:05.960
market for more debt to ensure liquidity look at what is happening with the debt

107
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:09.080
of companies, large, medium, and small in the United States.

108
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.470
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

109
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:18.130
<v 0>Do you have an idea?</v>

110
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.180
Michael Hartnett chief investment strategist at bank of America has estimated

111
00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:27.070
that $2.5 trillion in corporate bonds will be issued in the United States alone

112
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.600
during the year 2020 that's trillions with a capital T 2.5 trillion.

113
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.410
<v 1>It is.</v>

114
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.790
<v 0>That is equivalent. For example,</v>

115
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.840
do practically all the annual production of the British economy, almost twice,

116
00:06:40.841 --> 00:06:42.040
the value of the Spanish

117
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.793
Is not.

118
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.100
Or if we also take into account the relationship between net debt that is debt

119
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.630
minus cash and a bit profit before interest taxes, depreciation,

120
00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.010
and amortization, U S companies have the highest financial leverage in decades,

121
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.933
right?

122
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:11.590
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

123
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.820
<v 0>And keep one thing in mind,</v>

124
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.840
as much as both the U S government and the federal reserve have intervened to

125
00:07:16.841 --> 00:07:20.140
ensure liquidity. It may not do much good in the medium term.

126
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:24.190
An excess of debt usually ends up causing growth problems and even greater risks

127
00:07:24.191 --> 00:07:25.024
of crisis.

128
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:27.200
<v 1>This cycle.</v>

129
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.880
<v 3>Very different because we have a lot of support from central banks and we have a</v>

130
00:07:30.881 --> 00:07:32.290
lot of liquidity in the market,

131
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.430
but the old saying liquidity does not equal solvency is something that people

132
00:07:36.431 --> 00:07:38.470
need to keep in mind when they are investing.

133
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.560
<v 0>But I think that before we continue examining how things currently are and what</v>

134
00:07:44.561 --> 00:07:46.840
it could all mean, we need to take a look at how,

135
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.070
and when this whole culture of debts of unrestrained debt was set in motion,

136
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.190
where did it all begin? Listen up. The.

137
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.530
<v 3>New culture of financial engineering.</v>

138
00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:58.750
<v 1>This.</v>

139
00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:00.910
<v 0>Story may have originated in the eighties,</v>

140
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:04.750
a decade known among other things for the Reagan wave the music of Michael

141
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.770
Jackson and queen big hair pastorals and films like 80 back to the future.

142
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.850
And the empire story,

143
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.140
A decade that also had a, another very special characteristic,

144
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.840
the large-scale takeoff of financial engineering,

145
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.880
a process that had three main players.

146
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.170
Well, on the one hand professors, Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller,

147
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.620
who would go on to be the winners of the Nobel prize in economics,

148
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:36.130
two professors who presented a work that changed the landscape of financial

149
00:08:36.131 --> 00:08:39.550
culture. It was the well-known M and M theorem by Modigliani.

150
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:43.630
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

151
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.070
<v 0>You see up until that point,</v>

152
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.030
the idea that depending too much on debt was an element of weakness and risk for

153
00:08:49.031 --> 00:08:51.190
companies had always been widely accepted,

154
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.860
something that therefore diminished a company's value above that,

155
00:08:53.861 --> 00:08:56.160
the work of these two professors, the opposite

156
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.720
Johnny Miller theorem States that the market value of companies has to do with

157
00:09:02.721 --> 00:09:06.680
their ability to make a profit and the market risk of their underlying assets

158
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.810
and not with the manner in which they are financed.

159
00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.700
And not only that since interest,

160
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:14.450
unlike dividends is deductible and therefore allows for less tax to be paid.

161
00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.320
Suddenly debt is no longer seen as a risk, but as a means to add value.

162
00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:18.981
In other words,

163
00:09:18.981 --> 00:09:22.130
not resorting to high levels of debt could have a very high opportunity cost.

164
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:25.140
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

165
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.450
<v 0>The fact is that this theory had an enormous impact on both the academic and</v>

166
00:09:29.451 --> 00:09:31.940
business worlds. And when interest rates began to fall,

167
00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.730
many executives followed these guidelines to the letter.

168
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.060
They stepped on the accelerator and began to take on much more debt than had

169
00:09:38.061 --> 00:09:39.320
previously been the case.

170
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.870
But wait a minute, because along with these two professors,

171
00:09:44.871 --> 00:09:48.350
we have had to add the name of a third key player, Michael Milken,

172
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:52.010
a young bond salesman who reinvented the function of the market and became

173
00:09:52.011 --> 00:09:54.200
popularly known as the King of junk bonds.

174
00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.500
You see, as the head of the bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert,

175
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.640
Michael Milken promoted the idea that investing in low credit rated companies

176
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.570
debt in exchange for high interest rates could be a very profitable investment

177
00:10:08.571 --> 00:10:11.180
alternative. So in order to encourage that activity,

178
00:10:11.181 --> 00:10:15.110
he led the creation of a specific secondary market for issuers of these types of

179
00:10:15.111 --> 00:10:17.390
bonds, popularly known as junk bonds,

180
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:21.200
and this way for every bond traded in this market, the, from Drexel Burnham,

181
00:10:21.201 --> 00:10:23.180
Lambert pocketed, a generous premium,

182
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:26.180
which made it one of the most profitable corporations on wall street.

183
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.080
In the eighties,

184
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.770
we are talking about a market that was valued at more than $200 billion at the

185
00:10:30.771 --> 00:10:34.340
time companies with problems or medium and small businesses found in this

186
00:10:34.341 --> 00:10:35.600
procedure is a huge story.

187
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.623
<v 1>Funding.</v>

188
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.130
<v 0>And then what happens to happen happened issues of this particular type of low</v>

189
00:10:43.131 --> 00:10:47.690
rated debt increased 25 fold from just over 1 billion a year in the early

190
00:10:47.691 --> 00:10:52.310
1980s to levels above $25 billion a year. Of course, in the last two decades,

191
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:56.510
this kind of new debt culture has been joined by another key intervention that's

192
00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:57.373
of the central bank.

193
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:05.600
Since the beginning of the new century, in order to face first the.com crisis,

194
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.870
then the financial crisis and later to stimulate economic growth,

195
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.320
central banks have squashed interest rates to almost 0% levels.

196
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:15.350
Look for example, at how the rates set by the federal reserve happened.

197
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:24.650
<v 1>[Inaudible], that's not all.</v>

198
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.940
<v 0>It an eight and more particularly in 2020,</v>

199
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
the central banks have implemented another type of strategy known as

200
00:11:32.001 --> 00:11:35.990
quantitative easing policies or strategy consisting of creating new money and

201
00:11:35.991 --> 00:11:39.650
using it to buy hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars in debt assets,

202
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.780
mainly public debt, but also private.

203
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:44.780
This goes some way to explaining why since 2008,

204
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.140
the monetary base of the United States has multiplied by more than five,

205
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:52.970
going from about 840 billion to more than $4.7 trillion. And the,

206
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.110
of the big central banks, including the European central bank,

207
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:57.610
I've done practically the same thing.

208
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:00.630
<v 1>Friends.</v>

209
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.300
<v 0>This policy is precisely what explains news headlines.</v>

210
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:04.463
<v 1>This</v>

211
00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:09.510
pandemic sends real yields on corporate debt into negative territory,

212
00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:13.770
low interest rates and monetary stimulus dragged down yields of high quality

213
00:12:13.771 --> 00:12:14.604
bonds.

214
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:17.790
<v 0>So Lawrence, we have such a scenario.</v>

215
00:12:17.791 --> 00:12:21.720
How can we not launch ourselves into devouring more and more debt? Well,

216
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.290
the result of this entire new culture is obvious. While four decades ago,

217
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:30.030
almost 72% of all companies rated by standard and pours had a rating above

218
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.260
eight. Today, those companies represent less than 14% of the total. In fact,

219
00:12:34.261 --> 00:12:35.130
at the global level,

220
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.250
there are currently more companies qualified with a speculative grade.

221
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.640
Then we have an investment grade that is to say those with at least a triple B

222
00:12:41.641 --> 00:12:42.474
rating.

223
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.690
But that said,

224
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:55.290
the burning question is what exactly is the situation we are facing? Well.

225
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:59.580
<v 1>Let's take a look, a tidal wave of debt.</v>

226
00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.730
<v 0>Combined debt of us companies not only exceed $17 trillion,</v>

227
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.680
but also has an increasingly poor rating.

228
00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.160
That is to say everything indicates that the debt weighs more and more heavily

229
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.070
that's in spite of the fact that interest rates are coming down.

230
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:17.230
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

231
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.860
<v 0>Even among companies that do receive an investment rating,</v>

232
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.600
the largest issuances of debt correspond to companies with a triple B rating is

233
00:13:24.601 --> 00:13:28.230
companies that are only one step above what is considered to be a speculative

234
00:13:28.231 --> 00:13:30.560
grade, very close to what many would call junk.

235
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:42.640
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

236
00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.473
<v 0>Give you an idea.</v>

237
00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.550
Ruchi is Sharma chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley investment management

238
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:51.420
estimates that one in six us companies does not generate enough cashflow to

239
00:13:51.421 --> 00:13:54.600
cover the interest payments on its debt. One out of six companies,

240
00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.990
Four we're talking about companies that are very exposed to any financial

241
00:14:00.991 --> 00:14:04.650
problem that drives up markets and prevents them from attracting new financing.

242
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.410
They are what is known as zombie companies, companies.

243
00:14:07.411 --> 00:14:11.580
So indebted that they barely have any margin to invest transform or resist the

244
00:14:11.581 --> 00:14:13.320
tide. If the market becomes difficult.

245
00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:16.530
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

246
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:18.780
<v 0>Then as if that were not enough, there is another problem.</v>

247
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.290
Low interest rates are driving investors to take more and more risk in their

248
00:14:22.291 --> 00:14:24.720
portfolios to try to generate higher returns.

249
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:28.860
So what we find therefore is a progressive deterioration of the quality of many

250
00:14:28.861 --> 00:14:32.310
portfolios while it's us companies are increasingly burdened with debt.

251
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.280
And it doesn't matter if we look at investment grade or speculative grade

252
00:14:35.281 --> 00:14:35.880
companies,

253
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.180
the balance sheets are increasingly loaded with debt and their ratio to the a

254
00:14:39.181 --> 00:14:40.170
bitter generated.

255
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:41.603
<v 1>Rubbing.</v>

256
00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:52.250
If you have this, you should be when investing.

257
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.400
<v 0>If you don't want to run the risk of having a very unpleasant surprise in the</v>

258
00:14:55.401 --> 00:14:57.380
next few years, over the past few years,

259
00:14:57.381 --> 00:15:00.950
we have seen many companies pay dividends and buy back shares using more and

260
00:15:00.951 --> 00:15:03.830
more debt. And now the coronavirus may end up turning everything up.

261
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:08.380
<v 1>Just to give you an idea over the next one.</v>

262
00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.300
<v 0>UBS companies will need to refinance more than $1.5 trillion in high yield</v>

263
00:15:13.301 --> 00:15:15.040
bonds. Many of them junk bonds.

264
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.263
Anyway, there you have it.

265
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:23.050
This is the situation creating what many analysts consider the biggest risk

266
00:15:23.051 --> 00:15:26.470
ingredient for a future crisis on wall street. But what do you think,

267
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.090
do you think that this model is sustainable?

268
00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.300
Or do you think that this immense accumulation of debt will lead us to a new

269
00:15:31.301 --> 00:15:35.620
financial crisis instead will wall street be building its castle on a foundation

270
00:15:35.621 --> 00:15:40.450
