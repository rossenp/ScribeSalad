00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.430
<v 0>This video is brought to you by a news voice.</v>

2
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.270
<v 1>The news is broken almost all us media is owned by just a handful of big</v>

3
00:00:08.271 --> 00:00:11.000
corporations. Fake news is obviously a huge problem as well.

4
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:13.100
And finding something unbiased can be really hard.

5
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.680

Each new story shows multiple sources,

10
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.640
which are all tagged with their bias and perspective.

11
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.600
The news affects almost everything in our lives. What we hear and read shapes,

12
00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:35.900
which persons we trust, what we eat, what we buy, how we vote,

get started with news voice today for free through the link below it's available

19
00:00:56.541 --> 00:00:59.390
on both Google play and the Apple app store. And let's get into the video

20
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.630
28th of August, 2020 Shinzo RB, the longest serving prime minister,

21
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.260
and one of the most powerful in Japan's entire democratic period announced that

22
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.360
he has taken the decision to resign. He did.

23
00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:27.500
So just four days after becoming the longest serving prime minister in modern

24
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:28.334
Japanese history.

25
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.770
So why did he make that decision? Because Mr. Harvey,

26
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.820
65 has an incurable disease known as ulcerative colitis,

27
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.410
a disease that led to his resignation in his first term as prime minister in

28
00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:45.680
2007. Of course, this time, things are a little bit different.

29
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.380
His situation does not seem to be as bad now as it was then,

30
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.440
but the disease has been compounded by a bad political phase,

31
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.080
a critical juncture in which one year before the elections,

32
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.460
his popularity and that of his political circle is for the first time at rock

33
00:01:58.461 --> 00:01:59.294
bottom.

34
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.470
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

35
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.010
<v 1>Friends when Jim, so Bay came to power at the end of 2012, he did.</v>

36
00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:10.010
So with two very clear objectives on the one hand,

37
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.210
carry out an economic revolution that would put an end to the eternal Japanese

38
00:02:14.211 --> 00:02:17.510
crisis. Something that became popularly known as Abe Nomics.

39
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.750
And on the other hand to face the growing challenges in foreign policy,

40
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.440
Mr. Arby's particular wish was to enable the land of the rising sun to compete

41
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:28.130
with China's growing influence in the region and fast guarantee national

42
00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:31.760
security. These two key objectives were not only Shinzo Arby's goals,

43
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.850
but the hope of practically the whole country. And so today,

44
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.210
eight years after his arrival in power and taking into account that we are

45
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:39.500
witnessing the end of any era.

46
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.200
I think there's time has come to ask ourselves some questions.

47
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.780
What is the state of Japan today and have all,

48
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.370
or at least the main goals set by Shinzo RBA back in 2012, being achieved well,

49
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.770
as we've told you previously, that's not the case.

50
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.710
Shinzo RB was unable to carry out his main objective.

51
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.580
And indeed his departure comes at a particularly tense time in terms of national

52
00:02:58.581 --> 00:02:59.950
security. Let's take a look.

53
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.790
<v 2>The awakening of Japan.</v>

54
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.550
<v 1>Friends in a past video here on visual politic,</v>

55
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.340
we talked about the upside of Japanese economy.

56
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.420
The truth is that the last decade has not exactly been bad during this time.

57
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.360
The country has experienced somewhat of a revival. And indeed,

58
00:03:21.361 --> 00:03:25.920
although it's hard to believe it's real GDP in per capita terms has increased at

59
00:03:25.921 --> 00:03:28.650
practically the same rate as that of the United States.

60
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.950
And even more than that of countries such as France and the United Kingdom.

61
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.800
However, now the Corona virus crisis has changed.

62
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.353
<v 0>Everything.</v>

63
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.520
<v 1>While Japan's health situation is holding up.</v>

64
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.700
Its economic situation is worse than most developed countries.

65
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.870
You see the Japanese economy like most of the world's major economies has also

66
00:03:48.871 --> 00:03:50.100
been hit hard, check it out.

67
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.650
<v 2>Japan, GDP contracts, annualized 27.8% in April, June,</v>

68
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.820
Corona virus, pandemic causes biggest quarterly fall and post-war periods.

69
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.370
<v 1>However, Japan's problem goes much further than this.</v>

70
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.220
This pandemic has come at a particularly delicate time,

71
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.620
even before things were made difficult by COVID-19.

72
00:04:07.621 --> 00:04:09.210
The country was already in recession.

73
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.990
A range of factors contributed to it slump the conflict of South Korea,

74
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.240
the trade war between the United States and China.

75
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.290
And to top it off a rise in consumer taxes at the end of 2019,

76
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.500
had put the Japanese economy on the ropes. And then on top of that,

77
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.790
the coronavirus crisis

78
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.710
Give you an idea. The Japanese economic research center estimates that best.

79
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.760
If things go well,

80
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.380
the Japanese economy will not recover to the level of GDP it had in 2018 until

81
00:04:37.381 --> 00:04:40.500
at least 2024. In other words, in terms of economic growth,

82
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.530
that's five years down the drain and that's the best case scenario.

83
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.190
In other words,

84
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.750
the coronavirus crisis has devoured all the economic growth achieved during RV's

85
00:04:48.751 --> 00:04:49.170
years.

86
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.190
So let's just say that this is something that has hamstrung one of our main

87
00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:57.000
goals for Japan to escape it's never-ending crisis. But wait a minute.

88
00:04:57.001 --> 00:05:00.620
In spite of this, the truth is that during these years, Japan has changed a lot.

89
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:04.470
<v 0>In fact.</v>

90
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.630
<v 1>If Shinzo Arba has done anything at all,</v>

91
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.560
it's been to pave the way to a huge transformation of Japanese society in the

92
00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:11.341
coming years. Well,

93
00:05:11.341 --> 00:05:13.980
let me explain when this prime minister came to power in 2012,

94
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.590
and he put an economic plan on the table, economics,

95
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.870
which had three main facets on the one hand,

96
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.760
reviving the economy in a short term with a super expansive monetary policy and

97
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.650
increased public spending. Secondly,

98
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.720
to take advantage of this temporary inertia,

99
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.590
to carry out the great changes that would make growth possible in the longterm.

100
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.630
And you know what things didn't go backwards.

101
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:34.583
<v 0>You too.</v>

102
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.770
<v 1>Bobby, who's been a champion of free trade agreements over the last eight years.</v>

103
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.300
He has signed among others,

104
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.200
a very important free trade agreement with the European union and kept alive the

105
00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:48.900
TTP. The Trans-Pacific free trade agreement,

106
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.450
despite the withdrawal of the United States by Donald Trump,

107
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.140
Japan has also reformed the agricultural sector until our arrival,

108
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.040
the most closed and protected sector in country above all.

109
00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:01.490
He has driven enormous changes that have increased the working population,

110
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.800
even as the country's population is in decline.

111
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.880
<v 0>Hang on a minute.</v>

112
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.610
<v 1>How on earth did they manage to get the workforce to grow when the country is</v>

113
00:06:09.611 --> 00:06:10.510
losing population?

114
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:14.710
<v 0>Well.</v>

115
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.470
<v 1>By promoting the incorporation of women into the labor market,</v>

116
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.830
through among other measures, government funded childcare facilities,

117
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.860
and new types of contracts that facilitate a better work-life balance,

118
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.030
the result is obvious,

119
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.480
but that's not all incentives have also been put in place for many retirees to

120
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.800
reenter the labor market and above all immigration has been boosted. In fact,

121
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.830
as we have already told you here on visual politic in this respect,

122
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.460
Japan has started to break one of its main stumbling blocks, being a country,

123
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.170
very hostile to immigration.

124
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.460
Something that could become key in a rapidly aging society, such as this one,

125
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.360
just to give you an idea between Arby's arrival at the end of 2012 and 2018,

126
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.630
the immigrant population in Japan has more than doubled. In fact,

127
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.100
today one in eight people who come of age in Tokyo were not born in the country

128
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.350
In April, 2019.

129
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.670
One of the most important reforms of Shinzo RV era came into force a new

130
00:07:06.671 --> 00:07:10.690
immigration law that makes it much easier to work in the country and improves

131
00:07:10.691 --> 00:07:12.430
the rights of the foreign population.

132
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.220
If we immerse ourselves in the numbers that the government puts forward,

133
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.330
it may not seem like much until we realize that we are in one of the most

134
00:07:19.331 --> 00:07:23.410
historically hostile and closed countries in terms of immigration in one way or

135
00:07:23.411 --> 00:07:26.350
another. The reform set in motion by Shinzo Arba is history.

136
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.830
Of course, the results have been very limited so far in 2019,

137
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:37.540
only 10% of immigration quota set by the government had arrived in the country.

138
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:41.523
<v 0>Because.</v>

139
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.620
<v 1>Japan is still a very complicated country to work in.</v>

140
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.330
Think about it for a moment long days,

141
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.020
a huge cultural leap and many misgivings about if not clear,

142
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.130
rejection of foreign workers who are often perceived as poor and a burden on the

143
00:07:54.131 --> 00:07:56.890
state. Now let's be honest, unless you have a full wallet.

144
00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.340
You're probably more comfortable in another country. And even in the other case,

145
00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:01.990
if you are a qualified professional,

146
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.330
it is likely that the very long working days,

147
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.970
the few holidays and the obsessive work culture,

148
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.080
not likely to be that appealing to you, that at least is what the theory says.

149
00:08:11.081 --> 00:08:15.100
And it's also backed up by the surveys on foreign skilled workers. In any case,

150
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.550
the issue now is that the Corona virus has sunk the popularity of the government

151
00:08:18.551 --> 00:08:19.570
and put all this progress on.

152
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:24.160
<v 0>Yes.</v>

153
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.170
<v 1>It is true in the battle against the virus.</v>

154
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.590
Japan has done well with more than 125 million inhabitants.

155
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.690
It had only registered just over 60,000 positive cases and just under 1,300

156
00:08:34.691 --> 00:08:36.250
deaths at the time of making this video,

157
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.940
these numbers are a far cry from the nightmare that has been and is being

158
00:08:39.941 --> 00:08:41.770
experienced in other countries around the world,

159
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.940
just like Spain or the United States, Brazil, Mexico, or even Peru. However,

160
00:08:45.941 --> 00:08:46.690
despite this,

161
00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:50.170
the general feeling in the country is that the political leadership and faster,

162
00:08:50.171 --> 00:08:53.950
more agile measures to further reduce the impact of this pandemic have been

163
00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:56.640
lacking. And that is why the government's popularity has.

164
00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:57.473
<v 0>Plummeted.</v>

165
00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.540
<v 1>Skip the whole pandemic story. We've all heard enough of that.</v>

166
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.510
The truth is that beyond the management of this Corona virus,

167
00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:10.070
the end of RBA zero is overshadowed by what has perhaps been a great personal

168
00:09:10.071 --> 00:09:12.170
political failure. And also in some ways.

169
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.213
<v 0>National one.</v>

170
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.900
<v 1>I am referring to the country's inability to guarantee national security in</v>

171
00:09:23.901 --> 00:09:26.600
regards to North Korea and also China because friends,

172
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.500
one of our base great political objectives was to amend article nine of the

173
00:09:30.501 --> 00:09:35.120
Japanese constitution so that the country would abandon its pacifist policies.

174
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.520
And that has not been achieved. In fact,

175
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.250
despite having put all his weight behind it in recent years,

176
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.700
Japan's defense still suffers from basically the same problems it had when

177
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.110
Harvey came to power, listen up.

178
00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.850
<v 0>An increasingly complicated neighborhood.</v>

179
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.120
<v 1>Northeast Asia is becoming an increasingly dangerous community. For example,</v>

180
00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:00.320
let me ask you a question.

181
00:10:00.321 --> 00:10:03.530
Do you think that the North Korean crisis is already water under the bridge?

182
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.490
Well, you are very, very wrong since May, 2019. That's just over a year.

183
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.880
The pong yang regime has conducted 33 missile tests,

184
00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:13.220
including the simulation of a saturation attack.

185
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:17.360
This is an attack in which a lot of this Isles are launched on the same target

186
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.550
in order to exhaust the enemy's defenses.

187
00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.810
Not only that North Korea began 2020 by announcing a tougher foreign policy

188
00:10:23.811 --> 00:10:27.230
approach, including the possibility of resuming long range missile testing.

189
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.060
And of course it's not just North Korea,

190
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:33.290
China Shujing Ping's new China seems to be taking an increasingly expansionist

191
00:10:33.291 --> 00:10:35.540
line while modernizing its armed forces.

192
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.560
<v 0>Full speed.</v>

193
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:40.521
<v 1>Well,</v>

194
00:10:40.521 --> 00:10:44.930
China is an open confrontation with Japan over the control of the Senkaku Dow U

195
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:48.950
islands, a group of uninhabited islands located very close to Taiwan.

196
00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.670
Some think tanks and pro government newspaper supported by Beijing are now also

197
00:10:52.671 --> 00:10:55.940
questioning Japan sovereignty over the Island of Okinawa itself,

198
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.700
an Island with nearly one and a half million inhabitants.

199
00:10:58.701 --> 00:11:00.620
That is key to Japan's defense.

200
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.350
Okinawa is also the most important us military base.

201
00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:04.443
<v 0>In the region.</v>

202
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.460
<v 1>Of course, as we mentioned,</v>

203
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:11.330
all this is happening while the Chinese army has embarked on a huge program to

204
00:11:11.331 --> 00:11:12.380
modernize its armed forces.

205
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:20.240
For example, estimates suggest that by the end of this decade, that is by 2030,

206
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:24.410
the Chinese air force could have up to 500 operational fifth generation

207
00:11:24.411 --> 00:11:26.690
fighters, J 20 and J 31,

208
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.950
which would far exceed the projected fifth generation capability of Japan's air

209
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:31.400
force.

210
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:36.290
The land of the rising sun has signed off the acquisition of a fleet of 147

211
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.700
F 35 units,

212
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.000
which will make it the second largest fleet of this type of aircraft in the

213
00:11:41.001 --> 00:11:45.500
world. We are talking about a gigantic program worth more than $20 billion,

214
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.960
but no, it's not just about the jet fighters,

215
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.790
amongst many other pieces of equipment.

216
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:53.770
The Chinese military is also developing a new generation of ballistic missiles,

217
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.570
including supersonic missiles,

218
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:57.970
a force that could shatter Japan's current defenses.

219
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.500
And there's more as Chinese general, Marshall Chan stated in 2016,

220
00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.230
they are even developing a new long range stealth bomber.

221
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.120
And it is precisely because of this deployment.

222
00:12:07.121 --> 00:12:11.590
That Shinzo RFA was always clear that his main goal is number one objective in

223
00:12:11.591 --> 00:12:15.160
his second term as prime minister has to be to put an end to Japan's

224
00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:19.290
institutional pacifism and to boast of Japan's decimated self-defense forces.

225
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.590
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

226
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.920
<v 1>Progress has been made. We will certainly talk about it at length,</v>

227
00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:31.590
in a future video here on the channel under Arby's government,

228
00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:35.250
the Japanese armed forces have bought new equipment and even set up their first

229
00:12:35.251 --> 00:12:38.160
overseas military base in Djibouti. But in practice,

230
00:12:38.161 --> 00:12:39.870
everything remains basically the same.

231
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.200
Let's say that Japan has not managed to develop autonomous systems against the

232
00:12:43.201 --> 00:12:45.900
new threats. Its military budget remains relatively small,

233
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:49.590
almost seven times smaller than China's and Shinzo Arba has failed to push

234
00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.890
through a change in article nine of the constitution to put an end to the

235
00:12:52.891 --> 00:12:56.280
pacifist doctrine that has governed the country since the end of the second

236
00:12:56.281 --> 00:12:57.114
world war.

237
00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.580
<v 2>One, aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order the</v>

238
00:13:02.581 --> 00:13:06.510
Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign rate of the nation and the

239
00:13:06.511 --> 00:13:11.340
threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes to,

240
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.730
in order to accomplish the aim of the proceeding, paragraph land,

241
00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:19.590
sea and air forces, as well as other war potential will never be maintained.

242
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.370
The rate of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.

243
00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.950
Article name of the Japanese constitution.

244
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.760
<v 1>Well, things are not the same. In fact, they could potentially be even worse.</v>

245
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:33.893
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

246
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.790
<v 1>A bullwhip of Japanese defense has been its Alliance with the United States,</v>

247
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.150
a country that maintains 78 military installations in the country.

248
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.780
These are facilities for which Japan pays nearly $4 billion a year,

249
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:49.080
over 8% of its entire military budget for decades.

250
00:13:49.081 --> 00:13:52.740
The basic idea was that Japan would take over the defense while American forces

251
00:13:52.741 --> 00:13:56.010
would take over the action. This is known as the shield and sword model,

252
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.340
Japan character shield, and United States, the sword. However,

253
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.250
the Trump administration has changed everything. Now,

254
00:14:02.251 --> 00:14:05.370
the feeling in many countries like this is that they have to start taking care

255
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.233
of their own.

256
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:07.403
<v 0>Business.</v>

257
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:09.691
<v 1>And friends.</v>

258
00:14:09.691 --> 00:14:12.720
It's not just that the Trump administration has cast doubt on America's

259
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.570
commitment to the land of the rising sun. As for example,

260
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.500
when it demanded that the Japanese government pay more money to keep us troops

261
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.550
on the ground as if Japan did not already fit almost 90% of the bill or as if

262
00:14:23.551 --> 00:14:27.720
these deployments were not also advantageous for the United States itself. No,

263
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.120
it's not just that. There is also another issue.

264
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:34.530
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

265
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:34.950
<v 1>You see,</v>

266
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.490
following that shield and sword model and responding to the demands of the Trump

267
00:14:38.491 --> 00:14:41.190
administration itself, some three or four years ago,

268
00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:45.870
Japan decided to purchase the Lockheed Martin ages assure system for over

269
00:14:45.871 --> 00:14:48.900
4 billion dots. A system that moves the ages,

270
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.010
warship based ballistic missile defense to land.

271
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.550
The idea was to compliment the two layers of Japan's current missile defense

272
00:14:55.551 --> 00:14:55.940
system,

273
00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:00.020
which consists of the sea level with seven ages destroyers and the land-based

274
00:15:00.021 --> 00:15:02.930
Patriot missile system we've land-based installations.

275
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.140
It was the formula with which Japan wanted to protect itself from the North

276
00:15:06.141 --> 00:15:08.330
Korean threat and a potential Chinese threat.

277
00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:13.130
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

278
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:14.620
<v 1>This past June,</v>

279
00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.250
2020 to everyone's surprise and in what has been one of his last great decisions

280
00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:22.000
as prime minister Shinzo RB had this program thrown out, he canceled it.

281
00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:26.380
<v 2>June 15th, 20, 20 Japan, suspends ages,</v>

282
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:29.350
assured deployment pointing to costs and technical issues.

283
00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:33.370
<v 1>The anti-missile system on which the United States had embarked them on simply</v>

284
00:15:33.371 --> 00:15:36.820
does not seem to serve much purpose. At least not for Japan's interests,

285
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.760
because of course, if we're talking about the interests of Lockheed Martin,

286
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:40.780
that's a different story.

287
00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.410
<v 2>When the government said that Japan needed, I just on the ground,</v>

288
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.370
we already knew that missile defense was not effective in all situations.

289
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:51.280
Eventually it would take almost a decade to deploy.

290
00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.020
I just assure in the meantime,

291
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.860
our adversaries would be developing more effective weapons designed to weaken

292
00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:58.120
muscle defense. Hi,

293
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:02.950
go Saito professor at taco Shuko university and vice president of the Institute

294
00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.060
of world studies.

295
00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.040
<v 1>2016 And 2017.</v>

296
00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:10.060
The validity of the anti-missile system was already greatly damaged when North

297
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:13.840
Korea simulated its first saturation attack a strategy that could apparently

298
00:16:13.841 --> 00:16:16.630
overcome this entire system relatively easily.

299
00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:21.940
<v 0>And since then.</v>

300
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.570
<v 1>The development of missile technology and hypersonic attack vehicles that is</v>

301
00:16:25.571 --> 00:16:27.220
vehicles that operate at five times,

302
00:16:27.221 --> 00:16:29.290
the speed of sound being carried out by countries,

303
00:16:29.291 --> 00:16:32.830
such as China and Russia has brought to all the limitations of an anti-missile

304
00:16:32.831 --> 00:16:36.400
system. Like the one the United States assaulted Japan into the spotlight.

305
00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:37.600
And what can I say?

306
00:16:37.601 --> 00:16:41.410
The feeling on the ground in Japan is that they increasingly feel American

307
00:16:41.411 --> 00:16:45.940
politicians are treating them like some kind of cash cow and ATM machine to make

308
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.680
gold for the U S military industry.

309
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:50.530
But the fact is that all this leads us to a key question.

310
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.990
If Japan has suspended the anti-missile system,

311
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.880
how do they propose to defend themselves now?

312
00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:58.953
<v 0>Well.</v>

313
00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.270
<v 1>He himself made this very clear last June 18th,</v>

314
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.570
when he said the following at a press conference, we should.

315
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:06.910
<v 2>Renew our discussion of adequate deterrence.</v>

316
00:17:06.911 --> 00:17:10.750
We need considering North Korea's missile technology that has advanced since the

317
00:17:10.751 --> 00:17:13.360
time we introduced our missile defense systems.

318
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:16.030
The question is if we should stay within the boundary,

319
00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:19.570
when enemy capability is dramatically advancing Shinzo Abbey.

320
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:22.180
<v 1>The terrorists, that's the key word. In recent months,</v>

321
00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:25.150
the Japanese government has decided to open up this Pandora's box.

322
00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:29.050
That of being able to equip the self-defense forces with sufficient military

323
00:17:29.051 --> 00:17:31.660
capacity to attack an enemy preventatively,

324
00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.850
if they feel they are at risk of being attacked.

325
00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:37.630
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

326
00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:38.260
<v 1>In other words,</v>

327
00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.680
we are basically returning to the debate on article nine of the Japanese

328
00:17:41.681 --> 00:17:42.400
constitution.

329
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.300
The problem is that today the vast majority of Japanese society is simply

330
00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.193
against it.

331
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.490
<v 2>69% Pose chains to Japanese.</v>

332
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.580
<v 3>Constitution's war renouncing, article name poll shows.</v>

333
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:55.790
<v 1>In short, this is the great failure of,</v>

334
00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:59.660
or at least the great political disappointment of Shinzo RB.

335
00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:03.020
Not only has he failed to change the country's pacifist character,

336
00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:05.840
he has also failed to prepare it to face the new threats.

337
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:07.730
And even now at the end of his term of office,

338
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.240
he has given up the anti-missile shield that is in terms of national security.

339
00:18:11.241 --> 00:18:13.400
And despite this being a priority issue,

340
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:17.030
the country's structural weakness is almost as great as when are they came to

341
00:18:17.031 --> 00:18:19.310
power in 2012, progress has been made,

342
00:18:19.311 --> 00:18:22.850
and we will tell you about it in forthcoming videos, but in structural terms,

343
00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:23.660
things have not been.

344
00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:24.493
<v 3>Proved, much.</v>

345
00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:31.430
<v 1>Friends, shins, a Barbie and Gigi pink came to power at almost the same time.</v>

346
00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.700
The Japanese prime minister took the Baton barely a month after the Chinese

347
00:18:34.701 --> 00:18:38.450
leader did his mission to make Japan rival the growing power of China.

348
00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.780
There are clearly areas where he has not succeeded in this video.

349
00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:45.860
We wanted to tell you how Japan has changed and how it has not changed under

350
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:49.190
Arby's leadership. But now it's your turn. What do you think Japan should do?

351
00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:53.270
Will our base resignation undo the decision to break the U S missile shield,

352
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.390
leave your answers in the comments. So I really hope you've enjoyed this video.
