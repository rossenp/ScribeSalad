00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.350
<v 1>China has made a decision to end Hong Kong's free status.</v>

2
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.500
End of May, 2020, the national people's assembly,

3
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.100
the highest legislative body in the people's Republic of China voted to

4
00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:26.060
implement a new security act in Hong Kong that will give the Chinese regime the

5
00:00:26.061 --> 00:00:28.730
opportunity to pursue those propagating speeches,

6
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.970
ideas and political messages in the currently autonomous city,

7
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.720
a law that will allow the Chinese dictatorship to deploy its security and

8
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:37.310
intelligence services to Hong Kong,

9
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.540
to put an end to any symptoms of descent in this image that you see on screen ZZ

10
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.940
ping himself is voting in favor of this law.

11
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.000
This image is a reflection of how China is slowly swallowing.

12
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:48.830
The formerly known Pearl of the yeast.

13
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.340
<v 2>I can't imagine living under the shadow of the secret police.</v>

14
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.060
It seems that the last firewall that protects our freedoms is about to collapse.

15
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.210
Alan, a Hong Kong university student, and a statement to the Asia. Nick,

16
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.850
how you review the model of one country.

17
00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:04.910
Two systems that had been guaranteed to the people of Hong Kong is being

18
00:01:04.911 --> 00:01:08.000
completely broken down. This is the saddest period in Hong Kong.

19
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.950
I have no words to express in words,

20
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.850
the sense of despair that we have Dennis Kwok CRO democratic member of Hong

21
00:01:13.851 --> 00:01:16.670
Kong's, legislative tremor, Hong Kong,

22
00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:19.910
hedge funds explore the exit as a national security law looms.

23
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.990
The financial times.

24
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.380
<v 1>Is a topic that we are especially concerned about on visual politic and</v>

25
00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:27.650
something that we have already talked about in a recent video here on the

26
00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:30.260
channel. However, one question remained unanswered.

27
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.680
How has the international community reacted as to what looks like at the

28
00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:36.590
beginning of the end of what has been until now,

29
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.020
one of the freest territories in the world? Well,

30
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.890
the truth is that the international condemnation has been clearly lukewarm

31
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.520
lukewarm because in general, practically, nothing has been said or done

32
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.910
The country that has made the most noise has been the United States,

33
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.660
which has threatened to stop considering Hong Kong as an autonomous territory.

34
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.110
And that could mean that some of the advantages the city has in its relations

35
00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:03.200
with the United States would soon disappear. We're talking about privileges,

36
00:02:03.201 --> 00:02:06.380
such as reduced tariffs, free movement of people with capital,

37
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.690
almost unlimited access to U S technology.

38
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.530
And even the absence of restrictions on exchanges with the.

39
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.720
<v 0>Big action was taken today by the Trump administration against the communist</v>

40
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.280
Chinese party, secretary of state Palm PEO notifying Congress,

41
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.840
that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous and no longer warrants,

42
00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:29.090
special treatment under us law.

43
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.420
<v 1>So far, it has limited threats only in the commercial sphere,</v>

44
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.200
which would be of little relevance because direct exports from Hong Kong to the

45
00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:41.000
United States are minimal. However,

46
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.780
the United States is not the only country that is taking action, indeed,

47
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.200
despite the lukewarm international response and beyond the application of

48
00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:51.140
sanctions, that would mostly punish the very people of Hong Kong.

49
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.320
Some measures have been put on the table that are as a genius,

50
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.100
as they are potentially effective friends. Can Hong Kong be saved, listen up.

51
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.520
<v 2>Metropolis or Hong Kong 2.0.</v>

52
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.400
<v 1>Let's see if there is one country that has a particular responsibility for what</v>

53
00:03:11.401 --> 00:03:14.460
could happen in Hong Kong. It is the United Kingdom. After all,

54
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.330
almost half of all Hong Kong citizens were born when Hong Kong was still

55
00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:19.770
governed by the British crown.

56
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.190
And that is precisely what has made the government of this country speak out,

57
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.220
of course, in a very different way than the United States.

58
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.610
Look at this headline because here you can see that shots have clearly been

59
00:03:29.611 --> 00:03:30.444
fired.

60
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.860
<v 2>June 3rd,</v>

61
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.730
2020 Boris Johnson pledges to admit 3 million from Hong Kong to the UK New York

62
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:36.210
town.

63
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.250
<v 1>Yes, that's right. The British authorities.</v>

64
00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:42.150
First reaction has been to extend a kind of lifeline for all Hong Kong people

65
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.720
who may feel threatened by the growing control of the Chinese dictatorship.

66
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:46.680
And as you all know,

67
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.640
Hong Kong was part of the United Kingdom up until the 1st of July, 1997,

68
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.970
the dates on which the transfer of its sovereignty to Chinese hands was

69
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.283
affected.

70
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.060
<v 0>However.</v>

71
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.140
<v 1>Despite being part of the United Kingdom until 97 Hong Kong citizens didn't have</v>

72
00:04:01.141 --> 00:04:03.750
British citizenship since back in the 1960s,

73
00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.010
but only the rights to reply for what is known as British overseas nationality,

74
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.510
a status that gives any of the approximately 350,000 Hong Kongese that are

75
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.410
eligible for it,

76
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.550
a British passport and the possibility of using the services of embassies and

77
00:04:17.551 --> 00:04:21.030
constellates of the UK throughout the world. It is a status, however,

78
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.130
that does not grant holders, the rights to live.

79
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.570
<v 0>Work in the UK.</v>

80
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.240
<v 1>Well,</v>

81
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.020
what Boris Johnson's government is currently proposing would go much further on

82
00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:34.590
the one hand allow the possibility that the nearly 3 million people who were

83
00:04:34.591 --> 00:04:38.850
born in Hong Kong before 1997, may reapply for their status. On the other hand,

84
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.100
to extend the rights this status would entail.

85
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.450
You see the idea that the government has put on the table is that this status as

86
00:04:48.451 --> 00:04:49.590
a British overseas,

87
00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:53.190
national would now allow all holders to stay in the UK for 12 months,

88
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.850
holders can easily apply to be able to work and study in the country.

89
00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.060
And the 12 month period can be extended without any difficulty.

90
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.810
And not only that,

91
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.440
the idea circulating in the British government is that this method could also

92
00:05:04.441 --> 00:05:08.550
become a convenient path, a shortcut to for British citizenship.

93
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.420
<v 2>If China continues on this path and implements this national security</v>

94
00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:13.170
legislation,

95
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.040
we will do so we will allow holders of British overseas nationals passports to

96
00:05:17.041 --> 00:05:21.090
come to the UK and apply to work on study for extended periods of 12 months.

97
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.930
And in turn, provide them with a path to future citizenship. Dominic Rab,

98
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.070
UK foreign minister.

99
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.030
<v 1>That is the UK is given Hong Kong citizens a whole new escape route.</v>

100
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.750
But hold on a minute,

101
00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.440
is London thinking that suddenly hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong

102
00:05:34.441 --> 00:05:35.850
residents will pack up and move to the UK?

103
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.690
<v 0>Well.</v>

104
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.140
<v 1>Obviously not. However, if this initiative were put into action,</v>

105
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.130
most Hong Kong nationals would have a very attractive path for escaping the

106
00:05:47.131 --> 00:05:50.520
accesses of the Chinese government. That is anyone who is eligible,

107
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.880
could easily escape whenever they see fit without having to go through the

108
00:05:53.881 --> 00:05:57.210
complicated procedure of seeking political asylum. For example,

109
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.920
if as the Chinese government seems to want its control over Hong Kong and the

110
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:05.090
freedoms of the Hong Kong people are to be made stricter many politicians,

111
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.380
entrepreneurs, dissidence,

112
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:10.910
and students could at any time move to a safe Haven with all the guarantees that

113
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:12.920
they would need. And not only that at the same time,

114
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.100
it would push the Chinese government to think twice before crossing a red line,

115
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.460
because doing so could lead to a complete brain drain and talent.

116
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.980
And this is a situation that does have a precedent in the late 1960s and early

117
00:06:26.981 --> 00:06:27.940
1970s,

118
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.140
Ugandan dictator idiom in and the Kenyan government expelled tens of thousands

119
00:06:32.141 --> 00:06:34.120
of people of Southern Indian descent,

120
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.980
who in many cases had a British passport in 1972 and faced with this situation,

121
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.280
the British government of conservative Edward Heath made it possible for

122
00:06:42.281 --> 00:06:44.860
thousands of these refugees to settle in the UK,

123
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.730
nearly 30,000 people followed this path leading to one of the most socially and

124
00:06:48.731 --> 00:06:50.950
economically successful migrant cohorts.

125
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.820
<v 0>The country friends.</v>

126
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.180
<v 1>We are facing an ingenious solution that under the circumstances,</v>

127
00:06:58.181 --> 00:07:01.780
could it be the best possible response to China's threat, unlike sanctions,

128
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.720
not only does it not punish the Hong Kong people themselves,

129
00:07:04.721 --> 00:07:06.910
but it actually gives them a whole new lifeline.

130
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.850
And it is a move that has certainly infuriated China.

131
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.710
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

132
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.490
<v 1>Gee Jinping's government has already made it clear that it is absolutely opposed</v>

133
00:07:18.491 --> 00:07:20.830
to this measure and has threatened retaliation.

134
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.690
And when Beijing talks about retaliation,

135
00:07:22.691 --> 00:07:25.600
you can be sure that they're talking about financial retaliation,

136
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.350
which by the way,

137
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.070
raises serious doubts about whether London will eventually carry out this move.

138
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.610
Let's not forget the weight that China could bring to bear on the post-Brexit

139
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:38.560
economy. In any case. The question that comes up is,

140
00:07:38.561 --> 00:07:41.470
but what if with the support of the international community,

141
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.500
the British government granted this privilege to all Hong Kong people,

142
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.190
wouldn't that be a master response to GG pings, expansionist veracity,

143
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.210
wouldn't that be a way to make Hong Kong a symbol of the UK commitments to free

144
00:07:52.211 --> 00:07:55.600
countries in the fight against the expansion of authoritarianism?

145
00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.250
Well, it doesn't all went here.

146
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:07.210
Another idea has been put forward a much more original idea that could spell

147
00:08:07.211 --> 00:08:11.110
revolution. Something that I would say probably won't happen, but in any case,

148
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.310
it is interesting to keep in mind.

149
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.690
Could you imagine what would happen if the UK pushed for a creation of a kind of

150
00:08:16.691 --> 00:08:19.600
new Hong Kong in its own territory? Now stay with me.

151
00:08:19.601 --> 00:08:21.010
I haven't quite lost the plot.

152
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.160
It's an idea that the Adam Smith Institute has put forward.

153
00:08:24.161 --> 00:08:27.640
And the truth is that it wouldn't be as far fetched as it might seem at first

154
00:08:27.641 --> 00:08:28.474
glance,

155
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:34.720
Following the example of the square mile and above all Johnson's proposal for

156
00:08:34.721 --> 00:08:37.210
free ports that we have already talked about on visual politics,

157
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.050
the United Kingdom could enable a space within its territory where any Hong

158
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:43.480
Kong, citizen, or company, it could be freely transplanted,

159
00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:47.230
a space that would have regulations and the tax system similar to what currently

160
00:08:47.231 --> 00:08:48.130
exists in Hong Kong.

161
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.473
<v 0>Today.</v>

162
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:51.970
<v 1>In other words,</v>

163
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:55.950
we're talking about creating a special economic zone that become the best

164
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:59.580
connection point between Asia and Europe, whilst giving Hong Kong citizens,

165
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.790
even more options. And no, it's actually not such a crazy approach.

166
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.960
Keep in mind that much of the UK is economic success over the past few decades

167
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.100
as centered on the square mile and the special regulations that the UK approved

168
00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.950
for the financial industry, this would basically be something similar.

169
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:14.730
In addition,

170
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.690
it would also be a way for the United Kingdom to increase its competitiveness,

171
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.260
strengthen its ties with the Asian continent and attract business and talent

172
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:23.250
just when it needs it.

173
00:09:23.251 --> 00:09:26.370
Most having carried out Brexit I've old moved don't you think? Well,

174
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:26.800
that's what.

175
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.030
<v 0>I'll leave it for now. But the UK.</v>

176
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.760
<v 1>There is another country that is also following very closely.</v>

177
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.890
All that happens in the former Pearl of the East.

178
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.510
<v 0>A restless first cousin.</v>

179
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.290
<v 1>Is keeping a close eye on the events that are taking place in Hong Kong.</v>

180
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.360
And in Taipei, they are clear about one thing.

181
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.940
If she shipping's government gets its way with Hong Kong,

182
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.850
its next move may be to increase pressure on this Island,

183
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:03.290
an Island that is becoming the last refuge for many dissidents and political

184
00:10:03.291 --> 00:10:06.410
players who refuse to bend to the need of the Chinese dictatorship.

185
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.240
Now that helps explain, for example,

186
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.720
why applications for resident's permits in Taiwan by Hong Kong.

187
00:10:11.721 --> 00:10:13.100
Citizens are skyrocket.

188
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.490
<v 2>Number of Hong Kong are seeking residency spikes.</v>

189
00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.360
The number of people from Hong Kong, applying for residency in Taiwan last year,

190
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.820
Roos 41%, the Taipei Titans.

191
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:23.361
<v 1>Of course,</v>

192
00:10:23.361 --> 00:10:27.230
this also carries a risk and in Taipei they have many doubts about which path to

193
00:10:27.231 --> 00:10:29.150
choose. Now let me explain. On the one hand,

194
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.510
they have a great deal of sympathy for Hong Kong residents who have rebelled

195
00:10:32.511 --> 00:10:35.360
against the Chinese attempt to increase control over the city.

196
00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:36.530
But on the other hand,

197
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.410
it's not clear that anchoring the Chinese government too much,

198
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.640
maybe the smartest option.

199
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.553
<v 0>For the time being.</v>

200
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:49.340
<v 1>Article 18 of the Hong Kong and Macau act provides that the time when these</v>

201
00:10:49.341 --> 00:10:52.970
government will provide the necessary assistance to residents of Hong Kong and

202
00:10:52.971 --> 00:10:56.840
Macau whose security and freedom are immediately frightened for political

203
00:10:56.841 --> 00:10:58.430
reasons in practice. However,

204
00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.240
this law has not been developed and the process for asylum applications,

205
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.030
deadlines and available budget is unclear so far.

206
00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.850
The Taiwanese government has not wanted to open up this panel.

207
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.220
That is precisely why president citing wing,

208
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:17.720
who as we already discussed in previous videos is not exactly very friendly with

209
00:11:17.721 --> 00:11:19.400
Beijing announced at the end of may,

210
00:11:19.401 --> 00:11:23.840
the formation of a task force to make a final decision and to ensure once and

211
00:11:23.841 --> 00:11:27.920
for all the rights that Hong Kong citizens who apply for asylum in Taiwan will

212
00:11:27.921 --> 00:11:29.420
have one way or another.

213
00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:33.170
And this begs the question should the international community resolutely support

214
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.160
the site when government to make Taiwan the great refuge in the face of

215
00:11:37.161 --> 00:11:41.300
authoritarianism and the growing expansionism of the Jewish in pink regime.

216
00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:44.930
This is one of the questions that international news should take notice of at

217
00:11:44.931 --> 00:11:45.800
this point in time.

218
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:50.023
<v 0>Hong Kong is more.</v>

219
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:50.750
<v 1>Then justice city.</v>

220
00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.460
It is now becoming a symbol of where things could over the next few years.

221
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.760
And we honestly believe that one of the worst things that can happen is that

222
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.360
economic problems will make the Chinese government give full prominence to its

223
00:12:01.361 --> 00:12:04.450
political agenda and the trade war doesn't help there anyway,

224
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.650
that's where things stand.

225
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.770
But what response do you think the international community should give to

226
00:12:08.771 --> 00:12:11.890
China's growing meddling in Hong Kong's local affairs,
