00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.400
<v 1>So my friends, if we talk to you about espionage, about real spies,</v>

2
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.470
not about James Bond, double seven,

3
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.040
it is more than likely that the operations of Mossad,

4
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.960
the CIA and the powerful intelligence services of Russia,

5
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.740
or even the Chinese would quickly come to mind. In fact, to this day,

6
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.650
it is still not unheard of to come across the news stories.

7
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.360
<v 2>Us closes Chinese consulate in Houston,</v>

8
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.220
amid surge in Chinese espionage cases. Norway arrests man,

9
00:00:40.221 --> 00:00:42.170
suspected of spying for Russia.

10
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.800
<v 1>Of intelligence is not only fodder for cinema and literature,</v>

11
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.670
but it also remains a fundamental pillar and the security policies and influence

12
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.190
of many countries fighting against terrorism,

13
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.430
keeping an eye on your adversaries and also on your friends,

14
00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.420
looking for secrets,

15
00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:02.990
punishing your enemy or meddling in the political workings of a hostile country

16
00:01:02.991 --> 00:01:04.400
in order to destabilize it.

17
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.030
These are just some of the most common operations of an activity that takes

18
00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:09.770
place in a very different world.

19
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.450
From the one that we knew the world of shadows is sessions and distrust a world,

20
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.650
my friends, where the rule of law does not always act as an effective boundary,

21
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.880
not dimension. Of course,

22
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.720
the danger that can come from espionage carried out by countries without limits

23
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.980
countries where human rights,

24
00:01:24.981 --> 00:01:28.880
democracy and personal freedom are conspicuous by their absence.

25
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.050
But to what extent does such activities pose a risk to democracies freedom and

26
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:36.620
international stability, and what exactly are the risks that we face? Well,

27
00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:38.990
my friends in order to answer these questions and this video,

28
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.080
we have to travel to the Korean peninsula. And there it says,

29
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.460
If we have to give you one example of a country that has lived in an ongoing

30
00:01:49.461 --> 00:01:53.420
espionage war, that country would be none other than South Korea. As you note,

31
00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:57.560
I know the Korean peninsula is the last place on earth where the cold war not

32
00:01:57.561 --> 00:02:01.850
only, never ended, but is as alive today as it was in any previous decades.

33
00:02:01.851 --> 00:02:05.660
Since the 1950s, the incursions are South Korean spines into North Korea,

34
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.140
and much more frequently that of North Korean spies and to South Korea has been

35
00:02:09.141 --> 00:02:11.210
a constant for decades.

36
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.110
Let's just say that since the Korean war armistice was signed in 1953,

37
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.400
in terms of espionage, there has been no truce of the two countries.

38
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.880
The one that has done by far, the most damage has been North Korea,

39
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.160
a country that has not only planted spies,

40
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.850
but also produced elite units trained to carry out attacks in the city.

41
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.030
<v 0>So.</v>

42
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.750
<v 1>What do you see,</v>

43
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.020
would you like to know more about what is probably the darkest aspect and the

44
00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:40.400
coexistence of two ideologically opposed States like North and South Korea?

45
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.383
If you do it.

46
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.883
<v 0>Let's get cracking.</v>

47
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.850
<v 2>Espionage, a method of survival for Kim.</v>

48
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.710
<v 1>So friends of visual politics in order to better understand what we are going to</v>

49
00:02:54.711 --> 00:02:58.640
tell you later on, we must first look back and see where this all began.

50
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:01.620
<v 0>Specifically.</v>

51
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.730
<v 1>We have to move to the middle of the 20th century after liberation from Japanese</v>

52
00:03:05.731 --> 00:03:07.500
occupation in 1948,

53
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.250
the Korean peninsula was left divided into with one half under a communist

54
00:03:11.251 --> 00:03:11.611
government,

55
00:03:11.611 --> 00:03:15.240
akin to the Soviet union and the other under a conservative government akin to

56
00:03:15.241 --> 00:03:16.890
the United States and the West.

57
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.270
However that wasn't where it all ended tensions between the two regimes resulted

58
00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:25.560
in the North Korean invasion of the South in 1950 and invasion that led to a war

59
00:03:25.561 --> 00:03:28.080
that did not stop until 1953.

60
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.400
When a ceasefire was agreed upon an armistice that is still in effect to date,

61
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.310
however far from reaching peace and tranquility,

62
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.580
the subsequent decades have been plagued by provocations attacks,

63
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.770
espionage and assassination attempts.

64
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.700
These actions are fundamentally aimed at de-stabilizing the other site,

65
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.600
something that North Korea has been able to push to the absolute limit.

66
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.300
Let's just see the Kims have made their intelligence services,

67
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.100
their prized weapon in the world.

68
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.400
It doesn't matter whether it's to intimidate its enemies gained strength at the

69
00:03:59.401 --> 00:04:02.880
negotiation table, steel, industrial secrets, punished potential opponents,

70
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.790
or even seek ways to circumvent international sanctions.

71
00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:09.960
The North Korean secret services play a key role essential to the survival of

72
00:04:09.961 --> 00:04:11.130
that communist dictatorship.

73
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.420
And it was because spines are so important to the regime that the North Korean

74
00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:22.020
government considers them to be the most senior officials possible to give you

75
00:04:22.021 --> 00:04:26.400
an idea, they're on a par with the generals of the Koreans people's army itself,

76
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.800
and this way, spies have many privileges,

77
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.880
such as high salaries access to higher education and the ability to travel

78
00:04:32.881 --> 00:04:35.550
abroad, which of course is not at all common.

79
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.850
And one of the most secretive and isolated countries in the world.

80
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.240
No, some of you may be wondering but grunt, what exactly are we talking about?

81
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.050
How far do these operations go? What role does espionage really play?

82
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.050
And are you going to butcher more Korean names in this episode?

83
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.360
Do you want details and concrete examples, if you do less than.

84
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.070
<v 0>A history of provocations.</v>

85
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.821
<v 1>Green regimes,</v>

86
00:05:05.821 --> 00:05:10.050
hierarchies share one obsession is to make life impossible for their Southern

87
00:05:10.051 --> 00:05:11.070
neighbors. Thus,

88
00:05:11.071 --> 00:05:14.130
while the type of espionage carried out by South Korea has been prominently

89
00:05:14.131 --> 00:05:17.520
aimed at gathering military information and information on the country's future

90
00:05:17.521 --> 00:05:21.630
plans. North Korean espionage has been very, very different.

91
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:22.800
Obviously in this video,

92
00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:25.680
we are not going to be able to talk about each and every one of the new

93
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.980
operations that have been carried out, which are many.

94
00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.400
But we are going to tell you about some of the most striking ones and still my

95
00:05:32.401 --> 00:05:36.480
friends to understand the first one we have to travel back to the 1960s at that

96
00:05:36.481 --> 00:05:40.110
time in the South president park junkie was governing and he had come to power

97
00:05:40.111 --> 00:05:41.700
after a QD tar. And look,

98
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.970
I did butcher the names who would have thought this man, who, by the way,

99
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.050
as the father of the note,

100
00:05:46.051 --> 00:05:49.470
imprisoned former president of South Korea was a deeply conservative and

101
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.440
anticommunist military man, as you can imagine,

102
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.890
it's a character description that the North Korean dictator, Kim Il-sung,

103
00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.650
the grandfather of the current did not like very much at all parks hard lane

104
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:01.490
against North Korea,

105
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.420
his persecution of everything that seemed even mildly left wing and the

106
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:08.540
diplomatic and commercial openness that he set in motion.

107
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.110
And that puts South Korea on the international map for the first time.

108
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.010
We're more than enough reasons to literally put park in the bullseye.

109
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.450
There were at least two that's right to North Korea and attempts to assassinate

110
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.583
park Chung.

111
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.640
<v 0>The first one.</v>

112
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.310
<v 1>Was in January,</v>

113
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.850
1968 31 soldiers from an elite unit of the Korean people's army infiltrates in

114
00:06:30.851 --> 00:06:32.950
South Korea reaching the blue house itself,

115
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.140
the South Korean president's residence and soul,

116
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.620
the North Korean command entered the Capitol without too much difficulty and

117
00:06:38.621 --> 00:06:43.360
managed to go almost unnoticed until they were only 100 meters from the blue

118
00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:43.900
house.

119
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.500
It was at that moment that security teams protecting the South Korean president

120
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.040
discovered the operation fire was an exchange between the North Korean command

121
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.920
and the South soldiers and police and exchange that took the leaves of the

122
00:06:53.921 --> 00:06:56.230
command and dozens of South Koreans.

123
00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:00.850
All of this happened just 100 meters from the president's bedroom. Finally,

124
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.850
the assault ended with the capture of one of the members of the operation.

125
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.170
The rest of those who survived,

126
00:07:05.171 --> 00:07:07.630
the shooting took poison to avoid being interrogated.

127
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:11.500
<v 0>No, really.</v>

128
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.310
<v 1>It took poison like that as literally something I took a James Bond movie,</v>

129
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.030
North Korean spies are trained and indoctrinated to simply take their own laves

130
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.880
before being forced to reveal any information to the enemy.

131
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.570
Obviously this extreme decision is influenced by what may happen to their

132
00:07:25.571 --> 00:07:28.300
families. As you can surely imagine in North Korea,

133
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.170
the life that the family of a fallen hero can have as a far cry from the life of

134
00:07:32.171 --> 00:07:35.350
the family members of someone considered a traitor or a disaster,

135
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.510
Let's not get sidetracked.

136
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.050
The second assassination attempt against PARC occurred to justify five years

137
00:07:44.051 --> 00:07:45.610
later in 1974,

138
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.630
the national theater of Korea during the day of celebration of liberation from

139
00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:51.820
Japanese occupation. Interestingly,

140
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.210
it was a Japanese born North Korean infiltrator named moon sake,

141
00:07:55.211 --> 00:07:58.870
Wang who shot the president from the audience. However, it was not parked,

142
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.590
but sadly his wife, the first lady who died shortly thereafter.

143
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.220
But if all of that seems like a movie, we haven't even finished the trailer yet.

144
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.390
Wait until we tell you what the North Koreans did in 1987 a year before the.

145
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.380
<v 0>Olympics. Of course.</v>

146
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.700
<v 1>The North Korean dictator,</v>

147
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:20.350
Kim Il-sung was not happy that South Korea was to host the 1998 Olympics

148
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.520
naturally during that year,

149
00:08:21.521 --> 00:08:24.220
the South would be one of the main international players in the news,

150
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.980
a perfect opportunity to show the world the enormous development that the

151
00:08:26.981 --> 00:08:28.270
country was experiencing.

152
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.960
So the first step the North Korean leader took was to a nine star kind of

153
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.930
parallel socialists Olympics. The so-called world,

154
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:38.920
youth and student festival would be held in North Korea in 1989.

155
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.210
This was a $4 billion event for which the prong young regime have built a giant

156
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.750
$200 million Olympic stadium. The famous may day stadium,

157
00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.100
the largest in the world.

158
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:51.160
<v 0>But.</v>

159
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.880
<v 1>Get the, at the time North Korea was already a very poor country.</v>

160
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:58.410
It certainly doesn't seem like the best decision in the world to spend resources

161
00:08:58.411 --> 00:09:02.580
you don't have on organizing a socialist Olympics while your people are

162
00:09:02.581 --> 00:09:05.670
starving. Let's call that a dictator's whim.

163
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.290
But the fact is that unfortunately, the North Koreans did not stop there.

164
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.650
The worst was Kim's evil plan to wipe out the soul games,

165
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:17.040
a plan that was aimed at scaring the world and creating the feeling that the

166
00:09:17.041 --> 00:09:21.060
idea that going to solve for the Olympics was not safe at all.

167
00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.530
So what better way to do it than to shoot down a Korean airplane full of

168
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.410
passengers and new? We're not kidding you. In fact,

169
00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:30.300
that is precisely what they did

170
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.330
In 1987 months before the 1998 Olympic games, two North Korean spies,

171
00:09:38.331 --> 00:09:42.860
boarded flight eight five eight between Baghdad and soul with stops in Abu Dhabi

172
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.040
and Bangkok. The spies got off the plane at the Abu Dhabi,

173
00:09:46.041 --> 00:09:49.670
stopover leaving a bomb with a timer in sight shortly thereafter,

174
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:54.530
the plane exploded killing 115 people during the escape.

175
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.790
The two spies Kim song, Ooh, a 70 year old man and Kim young,

176
00:09:58.791 --> 00:10:01.580
white as 26 year old women were captured.

177
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.420
Kim song ELLs exceeded in ingesting the poison that North Korean spies always

178
00:10:05.421 --> 00:10:09.740
carry on their missions, but chem young Y was not successful and was taken.

179
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:14.000
<v 0>Sure.</v>

180
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.750
<v 1>He was traveling on a Japanese passport posing as a Japanese person because</v>

181
00:10:17.751 --> 00:10:20.780
she'd had language and monitors classes given to her in North Korea,

182
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:25.550
by a Japanese woman who had been kidnapped this by the way has been another of

183
00:10:25.551 --> 00:10:28.040
North Korea's favorite activities for decades.

184
00:10:28.041 --> 00:10:31.820
Kidnapping people from other countries, especially Japanese and South Korean.

185
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.380
The factor is that the female spine was sentenced to death,

186
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.570
but she got a presidential pardon?

187
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:44.810
It stood to reason that this woman was a valuable source of information for

188
00:10:44.811 --> 00:10:49.760
South Korean services. And so of course she was worth more alive. However,

189
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.510
her expressions of repentance earned her South Korean nationality and even the

190
00:10:53.511 --> 00:10:58.310
forgiveness of some of the victims families currently this former spine is 58

191
00:10:58.311 --> 00:11:02.330
years old and lives in a secret location and South Korea secrets for fear of

192
00:11:02.331 --> 00:11:04.100
being killed by North Korean agents,

193
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:07.820
she has offered several interviews and what she had said, things like these.

194
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.730
<v 2>When I confessed, I did so reluctantly.</v>

195
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.220
I thought my family in North Korea would be in danger.

196
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.900
It was a big decision to confess,

197
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.230
but I began to realize it would be the right thing to do for the victims,

198
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.450
for them to be able to understand the truth.

199
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.610
There is no other country like North Korea.

200
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.000
The whole country is set up to show loyalty to the GIM Royal family.

201
00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:29.270
It's like a religion. There are no human rights, no freedoms.

202
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.600
Eventually when I met the victim's families, we were all in tears,

203
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:36.710
hugging and crying. Kim [inaudible] former North Korean spy.

204
00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:41.570
<v 1>Take notes because letting spies live and ensuring their safety to obtain</v>

205
00:11:41.571 --> 00:11:45.770
information is not the only protection measure that South Korea has developed.

206
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.560
In fact, it is not even the most important one.

207
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.940
The main one is the national security act formerly called the anticommunist.

208
00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.450
This law regulates absolutely everything got contacts with the Northern

209
00:12:00.451 --> 00:12:03.420
neighbor. For example, if a South Korean wants to travel to North Korea,

210
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:05.610
this law States that the trip could only take place.

211
00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.750
If there is a very justified reason. And if it is approved by the government,

212
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:14.400
this act also prohibits all North Korean books or those that glorify the regime

213
00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:19.080
or communism just as it serves as a legal umbrella for prosecuting and blocking

214
00:12:19.081 --> 00:12:22.080
North Korean or pro Pyongyang websites.

215
00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:26.310
This law is basically intended to eliminate any ideological content that the

216
00:12:26.311 --> 00:12:30.120
North Korean regime could use to extend its influence in the South.

217
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.410
The question as though,

218
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.830
should a government limit access to its citizens of certain content.

219
00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:37.950
Even if that content is an apology for totalitarianism,

220
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.670
this is not a minor question zoo and typical visual politics style.

221
00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.060
Let's open up a debate in the comments. But anyway, at this point,

222
00:12:45.061 --> 00:12:47.160
I'm sure some of you are thinking, okay, grant, okay,

223
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.640
these cases you've told us about or events that happened more than three decades

224
00:12:50.641 --> 00:12:53.460
ago, that's a very long time ago, but what about now?

225
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:55.830
Are there still North Korean spies and the South?

226
00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.550
The answer is yes, there has always been.

227
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.940
And while the number of operational commands is undetermined, of course,

228
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.220
they are believed to number in the hundreds.

229
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.030
They gather information terrorized South Korean officials and politicians steel,

230
00:13:12.031 --> 00:13:15.720
industrial designs, and seek ways to bypass international sanctions.

231
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:17.070
But without a doubt,

232
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.520
the type of espionage that has the most pool right now for the North Koreans is

233
00:13:20.521 --> 00:13:22.020
not this type of espionage.

234
00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:25.440
Let's call it traditional the likes of double Oh seven of planted agents,

235
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:29.370
but the one that's going on on lane cyber espionage, in fact,

236
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:30.420
and just a few years,

237
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.110
North Korea has gone from making botch cyber attacks to being a much feared

238
00:13:34.111 --> 00:13:36.150
country in the world of cybersecurity.

239
00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.850
Something we have already talked about here on visual politic,

240
00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:42.540
but would you like to know a little more about this new battlefield? If so,

241
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:43.823
let's go there.

242
00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:53.880
<v 0>Neo espionage. When it comes.</v>

243
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:58.890
<v 1>Comes to doing evil, all innovation can be bent to your will, right?</v>

244
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.680
Do you remember the NSA techniques we saw in a pasta video?

245
00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:03.840
If you haven't seen it, I'll leave a link in the description.

246
00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.300
The fact is that this is exactly what North Korea,

247
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.630
one of the poorest and most technologically backward countries in the world

248
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.230
seems to have thought it currently has an elite squad of computer hackers.

249
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.290
We are talking about the apt three seven group,

250
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:23.580
a whole army of around 6,000 hackers who are fundamentally dedicated to three

251
00:14:23.581 --> 00:14:26.400
things, carrying a computer attacks against enemy countries,

252
00:14:26.401 --> 00:14:29.520
industrial espionage, particularly of the military industry.

253
00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:34.170
And finally the creation and dispersal of viruses that create havoc and swindle

254
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:37.770
money. The most notorious of the latter was the one, a crime virus,

255
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:42.570
which attacked them disabled around 300,000 computers worldwide in 2017.

256
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.160
We that as we told you before North Korea has also used its army of cyber

257
00:14:50.161 --> 00:14:54.860
soldiers to steal $81 million from a bank and Bangladesh and to destroy Sony

258
00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:57.650
pictures, servers, and response to the film, the interview,

259
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.670
and which of the Kim Jong UN character was spoilers murdered.

260
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.370
But we don't even have to go that far back in time.

261
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:07.610
There is much more recent activity. Check count this headline.

262
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:12.610
<v 0>August, 2020, North Korea, cyber attacks, Israel steals,</v>

263
00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.100
classifying data, which could be sold to Iran.

264
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.070
<v 1>Yeah, that's right. It was confirmed just last month.</v>

265
00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.250
But the North Korean hackers had managed to defeat the cyber defenses of the

266
00:15:21.251 --> 00:15:25.300
Israeli army. One of the most technologically prepared bodies in the world,

267
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.240
this attack, which technically was more industrial cyber spying,

268
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.550
focused on stealing data from weapons models.

269
00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:35.350
And it's not certain where that data will end up and the factors that apart from

270
00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:36.184
their own use,

271
00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:41.140
we cannot forget a run as rails arch enemy as an ally of North Korea.

272
00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:45.490
And they may have turned to the North Korean AP T3 seven group for sweet revenge

273
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.950
by taking over their most secret information.

274
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.410
The point is if and it's physical dimension,

275
00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:56.740
the North Korean army doesn't seem to be ready to attack other countries or do

276
00:15:56.741 --> 00:15:57.574
missions abroad.

277
00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:02.380
Why not form a good team of hackers and do it over the internet from home?

278
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:05.800
Finally working remotely has come to North Korea.

279
00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:08.650
The move seems masterful. What's more,

280
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.770
they can use this method to steal information from companies, for example,

281
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.850
patents, and then be able to produce their own copies. But now as always,

282
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.900
we leave over to you.

283
00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.960
Do you think that South Korea should have responded militarily to the numerous

284
00:16:19.961 --> 00:16:23.470
incursions of North Korean spice and special agents as the world safe from the

285
00:16:23.471 --> 00:16:26.470
nascent North Korean cyber military superpower, as always,

286
00:16:26.471 --> 00:16:28.630
