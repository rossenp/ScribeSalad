<v 1>End of March, 2020, during the first wave of the SARS coronavirus to pandemic.</v>

3
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.630
We told you in a video here on visual politic,

4
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.470
the mistakes that Spain had made had caused it to become the worst epicenter of

5
00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:26.690
the pandemic. Well, six months later,

6
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.510
things kind of seem to be back to square one,

7
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.180
and you will soon see that compared to the rest of Europe.

8
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.850
The data from Spain is very, very bad.

9
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.380
The time of making this video,

10
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.030
Spain was accumulating more than 10,000 new positive cases every day.

11
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.360
And total the number of confirmed cases since the beginning of the pandemic is

12
00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:52.130
now well over 800,000 since mid July and after one of the

13
00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:56.480
strictest quarantines and the world Spain has seen its numbers skyrocket again.

14
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.100
And it's not just the positive cases.

15
00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:01.610
The number of deaths have been growing steadily since August as well. Yes,

16
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.160
the numbers are very different from those of March and April,

17
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.580
but with between 100 and 200 deaths every day,

18
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.900
Spain has already amassed around 50,000 deaths to the beginning of the pandemic.

19
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.740
A figure that in relation to its population is the highest rate and the world

20
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.350
behind only the European micro state of sun.

21
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.603
<v 0>Reno.</v>

22
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.500
<v 1>No matter what data we look at on a European level,</v>

23
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.430
Spain is by far the country that has worst managed the first wave and is also

24
00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:31.010
the country that is doing the worst job managing.

25
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.790
<v 0>The second wave. Listen up Spain, once again,</v>

26
00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:38.360
grapples with Europe's worst infection rate the Telegraph.

27
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.720
<v 1>And actually they win the prize, not only in Europe,</v>

28
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.520
but in the whole developed world,

29
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.090
because the truth is that despite what many Spanish politicians are seeing and

30
00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:48.500
attempts to exculpate themselves,

31
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.130
those dire statistics are not something that is happening all over the world.

32
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.500
Not even anywhere else in Europe, certainly not to the same

33
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.410
Without digging too deeply. There is the case of Italy,

34
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.340
a country that is very socially and culturally, similar to Spain. And which,

35
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.150
as you all know,

36
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.960
during the months of February and March of 2020 was one of the first epicenters

37
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:14.480
of the pandemic in the world. Well,

38
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.940
to give you a comparison at the time of making this video,

39
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.770
the spread of the virus and excellent was only 46.5 cases per 100,000

40
00:02:21.771 --> 00:02:24.590
inhabitants and 14 days in Spain,

41
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.040
the spread of the virus has increased to 302.4 cases,

42
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.300
6.5 times more than that, Italy take a look at this map.

43
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.510
You see on the screen, as you can see, only the Czech Republic,

44
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.080
where I live the Netherlands and France of figures that are similar to Spanish

45
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.890
levels to say that they're close as a bit of an exaggeration because the spread

46
00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:46.790
rates registered in these countries are still much lower than Spain's.

47
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.400
Something does not add up here. Does it?

48
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.540
And what on earth has been done to find themselves with such figures and October

49
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.520
whose fault is it, and more importantly,

50
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.920
what could have been done to avoid the situation that makes spin. Once again,

51
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.130
trailing the pack of all the other countries of Europe.

52
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.490
Are you ready to investigate? If you are, let's get cracking.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.010
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

55
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.510
<v 3>From bad to worse.</v>

56
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.130
<v 1>My visual Paul Amigos, we're talking about spin. You see what I did there,</v>

57
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.000
as you can imagine,

58
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.820
in order to reach the dubious title of the worst Western country,

59
00:03:35.821 --> 00:03:37.680
in terms of the coronavirus by September,

60
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.980
the Spanish must have done something very, very wrong.

61
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.660
Something that in Spain's case began as far back as me and June,

62
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.780
2020 during the so-called deescalation of quarantine measures,

63
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.470
the deescalation was a process of several weeks that serve as a transition

64
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.560
between the total confinement of the population that took place between March

65
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.550
and may and the return to normality through three phases with gradually fewer

66
00:03:59.551 --> 00:04:00.330
restrictions.

67
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.450
We are talking about critical process that if not handled correctly,

68
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.020
carries a risk that this situation will soon get out of control again.

69
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.510
And that is exactly what happened.

70
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.180
The government of Petro Sanchez,

71
00:04:15.181 --> 00:04:17.640
which took control of the process during the quarantine,

72
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.560
by declaring a state of alarm,

73
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.500
which included commandeering some of the powers that regional governments

74
00:04:22.501 --> 00:04:27.210
usually have failed miserably to prepare the country for the return to the new

75
00:04:27.211 --> 00:04:27.810
normal,

76
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.550
such a transition should have included lots and lots and lots of

77
00:04:32.551 --> 00:04:36.450
tests and many managed research to control outbreaks and to keep what is known

78
00:04:36.451 --> 00:04:39.600
as community transmission to an absolute minimum.

79
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.913
<v 2>[Inaudible] [inaudible].</v>

80
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.650
<v 1>Wait a minute because the central government of Spain was by no means the only</v>

81
00:04:55.651 --> 00:04:57.690
one who got it terribly wrong, right?

82
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.210
The autonomous communities,

83
00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:06.900
which in Spain are a bit like state governments have power over public health

84
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.780
and are responsible for managing the health system and their regions.

85
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.280
And they have not been exactly up to the task. At least not many of them have,

86
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.790
for example, and regions such as Madrid, Aragon, and Catalonia,

87
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.300
autonomous governments were unable to set up tracing teams to promptly detect

88
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.650
positive cases and test their environments in order to prevent further sprint

89
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.880
something which has proven to be indispensable in the fight against the Karumba.

90
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.220
<v 3>Alarm for the insufficient tracers and monitoring of cases,</v>

91
00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.390
the experts in this task of surveying the positive cases to assess whether their

92
00:05:39.391 --> 00:05:44.220
contacts or social family or workmates and start their monitoring do not

93
00:05:44.221 --> 00:05:47.790
reach 200 throughout Catalonia Lavonne Gardia,

94
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.510
July 15th, 20, 20 Madrid,

95
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.410
and Catalonia have 15% of the tracers that are needed economic stuff to give you.

96
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.150
<v 1>Some idea, do you know how many were needed in Madrid and Catalonia?</v>

97
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.440
That is the minimum number to control the virus after confinement. Well,

98
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.570
between 2000 and 3000,

99
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.320
that's a low estimate and calculated for an environment where the pandemic was

100
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.970
under control. Of course. Well, in July, there weren't even 200.

101
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.580
And at the time of making this video and Madrid, for example,

102
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.250
there were only about 800 active tracers,

103
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.600
800 tracers that in practice seem to be stuck simply on the phone.

104
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.570
And it's not the lack of resources is a problem for these governments,

105
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.230
the autonomic governments of Madrid and Catalonia manage annual budgets of more

106
00:06:30.231 --> 00:06:33.050
than 20 and 30 billion years respectively.

107
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.780
But in order to get a more detailed view of what's happened,

108
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.420
let's focus for a moment on the case of Madrid.

109
00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.573
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

110
00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.000
<v 1>The community of Madrid, not only the Spanish epicenter,</v>

111
00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.780
but also the European and even global epicenter for a good part of the first

112
00:07:04.781 --> 00:07:05.830
wave has once again,

113
00:07:05.831 --> 00:07:08.950
become the region with the highest transmission rate for the Corona virus and

114
00:07:08.951 --> 00:07:13.440
the entire Western world at the beginning of the second wave Madrid was the

115
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:18.070
recorded incidents of over 700 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 14

116
00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:22.000
days at the end of September was already the worst source of infection and

117
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:24.670
Europe for the second time and six months.

118
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:31.690
And the question, the million dollar question is what has regional president,

119
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.010
Isabel Diaz and her government done to prepare for the second wave after all

120
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.170
they've had plenty of time to do so, right?

121
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.440
What contingency plan did the Madrid government prepare for its citizens as it

122
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.860
watch the cases grew steadily and Catalonia during the month of June,

123
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.800
that they think that Madrid would be immune from a second wave and that they

124
00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:48.640
would not be had again,

125
00:07:48.641 --> 00:07:52.930
despite constant warnings from the medical and scientific community and short,

126
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.890
what were their priorities? Well, here's a taste.

127
00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:02.440
<v 3>4.5 Million euros in grants in Madrid to support fighting bull</v>

128
00:08:02.441 --> 00:08:03.220
livestock,

129
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:08.080
ABC Madrid subsidy to the electric bicycle up to 600 euros.

130
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:12.070
If it is not a sports or high end bike at a confidential, okay.

131
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:16.000
<v 1>Now this may seem a little populists on our part, but that is the truth.</v>

132
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:19.030
These are just two of the many examples we could give the government of the

133
00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:22.630
community of Madrid has proven its lack of clarity about what its priorities.

134
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.793
<v 0>B.</v>

135
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.810
<v 1>Sports centers are purchases new facilities for public employees, tax breaks.</v>

136
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.320
You only have to take a look at the community of Madrid's press page to realize

137
00:08:35.321 --> 00:08:38.110
that something something's not quite right,

138
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.560
these are all things that were simply not a priority,

139
00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.420
but of course let's not kid ourselves.

140
00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:46.150
It's not surprising that they did all this because the regional president of

141
00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:50.560
Madrid herself, Isabel Diaz, I also told the president of Spain, Pedro Sanchez,

142
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.610
that she believed the pandemic was over. You don't believe me.

143
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.973
Listen for yourself.

144
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.143
<v 4>[Inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

145
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:19.063

147
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:26.600
<v 5>So is it possible.</v>

148
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.410
<v 1>But that is the explanation for such a lack of control and such chaos.</v>

149
00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.280
Is it possible that Spanish politicians are so disconnected from reality that

150
00:09:34.281 --> 00:09:38.450
they did not realize that the pandemic was not yet over how you can regional

151
00:09:38.451 --> 00:09:41.600
governments spend three months demanding that the central government give them

152
00:09:41.601 --> 00:09:43.910
back their powers and the area of public health,

153
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.120
and then do absolutely nothing.

154

<v 5>[Inaudible] DNN</v>

155
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:04.303
[inaudible] [inaudible].

156
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.300
<v 1>Rita as it may. The reality is what it is.</v>

157
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.230
And the reality is that since the end of the confinement and in particular,

158
00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.920
since early September, when many Madrid residents returned from vacation,

159
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.860
the Madrid subway has been overflowing with people,

160
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.640
the carriages and the platforms we're at full rush hour capacity.

161
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.880
And the safety distances could not be kept because the summer schedule with

162
00:10:25.881 --> 00:10:28.760
reduced frequency was kept well into September.

163
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:32.630
Without anyone noticing someone was having a siesta at the wheel.

164
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.310
I did that again,

165
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:38.000
nor did the Madrid government asked the ministry of transport to put more trains

166
00:10:38.001 --> 00:10:39.740
on the metropolitan lanes of rent, freeze,

167
00:10:39.741 --> 00:10:44.180
commuter rail system to avoid congestion. Nothing was done at all.

168
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.900
Protocols and contingency plans were conspicuous by their absence,

169
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:51.980
a disaster that has caused Madrid to have the highest rate of positive PCR tests

170
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.100
in all of Europe. I'm one of the highest rates in the developed world.

171
00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:55.963
<v 5>World.</v>

172
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.800
<v 1>In concrete terms at the end of September 20.7% of the more than 150,000</v>

173
00:11:03.801 --> 00:11:06.710
PCR tests that were being carried out in Madrid each week,

174
00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.740
we're coming back positive. We're talking about a contagion rate.

175
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.500
That's twice the national average and four times the limit,

176
00:11:12.501 --> 00:11:15.020
but what's the pandemic is considered to be out of control.

177
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.350
Our limits to the world health organization says it's fine.

178
00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:22.280
<v 5>To me.</v>

179
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.460
<v 1>Even if you do about 150,000 tests a week,</v>

180
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:30.020
more than 20% of the test and Madrid are positive during the month of September,

181
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:34.820
the virus was running wild so much SU that even with so many

182
00:11:34.821 --> 00:11:35.654
tests,

183
00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:39.650
there were still an adequate in order to control the pandemic and Madrid and

184
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.090
adequately detect infections,

185
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.090
it would be necessary to do about four times more tests,

186
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.010
more than half a million a week.

187
00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:50.240
And not only would this be materially impossible given the available resources,

188
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.710
but also what is actually happening is just opposite.

189
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.070
Even fewer tests are being collected. Check this out.

190
00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:01.770
<v 2>Madrid will no longer test people in close contact with the positive case,</v>

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.230
new guideline in the region. El Espanol.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.460
<v 1>My Amigos,</v>

193
00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:09.390
the management disaster that Spanish politicians have been leading does not end

194
00:12:09.391 --> 00:12:10.224
there.

<v 1>Example. If one is needed of bad management is radar.</v>

200
00:12:50.131 --> 00:12:53.430
COVID an application launched by the Spanish government to report to positive

201
00:12:53.431 --> 00:12:56.100
cases of coronavirus, which some autonomous communities,

202
00:12:56.101 --> 00:12:59.340
such as Madrid and Catalonia had blocked. Why,

203
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.310
how is it possible that the various administrations,

204
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.610
both the government of Spain and the regional governments did not dedicate all

205
00:13:05.611 --> 00:13:09.540
the necessary resources to set up equipment and teams for mass testing and

206
00:13:09.541 --> 00:13:12.960
tracing. They knew, I mean, they had to know that it was something important.

207
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.780
Europe warned about it. The world health organization warned about it.

208
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.590
And the experience of countries that have successfully confronted COVID-19 have

209
00:13:19.591 --> 00:13:22.500
proved it. Test trace isolates.

210
00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:27.330
That was the key formula. However, if we have just seen with the case of Madrid,

211
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:31.110
the truth is the practically no region took the end of the confinement very

212
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.420
seriously. In fact, as early as July,

213
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:38.100
just one month after the end of the deescalation outbreaks began to appear all

214
00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:39.180
over the country,

215
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:43.650
The outbreaks,

216
00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:47.610
but as grip infections of more than three cases with the same origin quickly

217
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:51.840
multiplied until they got so out of control and a municipality in Garcia and in

218
00:13:51.841 --> 00:13:53.790
the province of leader and Catalonia,

219
00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:57.540
where apparently the cases spread rapidly due to cases, imported from Africa,

220
00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:01.110
by seasonal workers who went to work in the fields. In fact,

221
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:04.020
one of the biggest mistakes of the autonomous governments was not to guarantee

222
00:14:04.021 --> 00:14:08.070
the health and safety of the seasonal workers who as in previous years were

223
00:14:08.071 --> 00:14:12.570
housed and shared rooms of 10 or even more people without any safety distancing

224
00:14:12.571 --> 00:14:13.080
measures.

225
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.710
These factors forced the confinement of an area in the region of gala SIA and

226
00:14:16.711 --> 00:14:18.990
another in the Providence of leader. However,

227
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.380
while the gala scenes managed to control the outbreak quickly and Catalonia,

228
00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:26.160
the government of queen Torah also failed at least initially to the point that

229
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:29.820
Lolita outbreaks made the leap to the entire Barcelona metropolitan area.

230
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.580
Of course, during the summer, the virus found it very,

231
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.660
very easy to make the jump to other regions such as Oregon, the Basque country,

232
00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.950
Navea and Madrid, where the situation eventually got totally out of control.

233
00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.370
There was neither sufficient testing nor widespread screening,

234
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:52.220
nor efficient contact tracing, nor even sufficiently strict social measures.

235
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:53.810
And to all of that,

236
00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.310
we have to add that the deescalation was already very optimistic. The bars,

237
00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.180
the nightlife spots,

238
00:14:59.181 --> 00:15:02.840
and even some of the other popular festivals and public events were opened as

239
00:15:02.841 --> 00:15:04.010
soon as possible.

240
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:07.610
So that allows us to say that the virus has the ideal breeding ground over the

241
00:15:07.611 --> 00:15:11.450
summer to gather all those pieces and put all of Spain back and check me.

242
00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:14.780
And as we have seen that is precisely what happened.

243
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:23.680
Another one of the tremendous fiascos during the deescalation on the weeks that

244
00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:27.790
followed was the absolute lack of control and the Spanish ports and airports,

245
00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.060
the Spanish government, which is responsible for foreign health,

246
00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:35.410
refuse to test international travelers for coronavirus, not even quick tests,

247
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.080
and also refuse to require a test at origin.

248
00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:42.010
Instead they set up what they called a visual check,

249
00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:45.430
a farce by which public health officials could supposedly detect whether you had

250
00:15:45.431 --> 00:15:49.750
symptoms of coronavirus by looking at you. Yeah, yeah.

251
00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:51.700
With their Superman, like x-ray vision,

252
00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.550
they could see within you and see whether or not you were sick.

253
00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.790
Just listen to what the health minister himself sent and meant.

254
00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.710
<v 0>[Inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible].</v>

255
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:14.140
<v 1>Of course it's hardly surprising that everything got out of control and spin</v>

256
00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:15.040
well. In other places,

257
00:16:15.041 --> 00:16:17.980
the tracing teams worked on border controls were frequent and consistent.

258
00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.170
As for example, in Italy, in Spain,

259
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.190
you can see that they were not a sheet of paper, a visual check,

260
00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.540
and off you go, but what could possibly be behind such a lack of action,

261
00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.280
Amigos Annemarie's tourism accounts for 13% of spins,

262
00:16:36.281 --> 00:16:39.040
GDP and hundreds of thousands of jobs depend on it.

263
00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:42.790
So the government thought it best not to hinder the arrival of travelers.

264
00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.810
However, that strategy turned out to be a real disaster.

265
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.970
A few weeks after the start of the tourist season,

266
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.630
the cases began to rise and it was the countries of origin of the tourist

267
00:16:52.631 --> 00:16:53.464
themselves,

268
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:57.160
the began to discourage and even prevent their citizens from traveling to Spain

269
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.830
or at least to its most effected areas.

270
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.780
<v 3>We'll establish a quarantine for all travelers coming from Spain,</v>

271
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:06.183
Lavonne Garcia,

272
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.990
Switzerland joins the other 28 countries that impose a quarantine for travelers

273
00:17:10.991 --> 00:17:12.850
coming from Spain RTV.

274
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:14.140
<v 1>In other words,</v>

275
00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.990
the Spanish government thought that by not putting measures in place,

276
00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:21.010
they would save the tourist season. But what happened was exactly the opposite.

277
00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:31.120
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

279
00:17:31.511 --> 00:17:35.560

00:17:35.561 --> 00:17:38.800
Spanish economy recording the largest drop and all of Europe.

281
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:43.630

285
00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.550
<v 1>Yeah. 17.8% to give you an idea.</v>

286
00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:59.000
This is a drop of almost 60% more than the rest of Europe.

287
00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:02.420
And in the third quarter, things are continuing to be just as bad.

288
00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:06.380
The disastrous management of the pandemic is also causing a terrible economic

289
00:18:06.381 --> 00:18:10.520
situation that we'll see Spain recording the worst performances in all of Europe

290
00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:11.570

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.900
<v 1>Let's take just one moment here at this point.</v>

297
00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:33.890
Many of you are probably asking yourselves how on earth can anyone with

298
00:18:33.891 --> 00:18:37.610
responsibility for governing and managing do such a shocking job?

299
00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:42.230
Who are the people responsible for this disaster? Well, let's take a look.

300
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.580
<v 0>[Inaudible] the real virus.</v>

301
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:53.780
<v 1>You see my visual poem. And he goes,</v>

302
00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.990
if there is one thing that differentiates Spain from other countries in Europe

303
00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.180
is the SARS cov two Corona virus.

304
00:18:59.181 --> 00:19:02.990
Pandemic is not the only one the country is facing. There is another, the,

305
00:19:02.991 --> 00:19:06.800
I am sorry to say runs rampant among the political class of the country,

306
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:10.790
that of the extreme incompetence of the leaders and public officials.

307
00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:18.140
Yeah. Okay. Maybe you think I'm being just a little bit too harsh,

308
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:19.910
but it's just that having made Spain,

309
00:19:19.911 --> 00:19:23.210
the epicenter of the Corona virus and March and letting it happen again in

310
00:19:23.211 --> 00:19:26.630
September without any particular measures having being taken well,

311
00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.660
I don't really know you tell me how do I explain.

312
00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.493
<v 0>That.</v>

313
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:36.020
<v 1>Case in point it was not until the end of September seven months after the</v>

314
00:19:36.021 --> 00:19:39.470
beginning of the pandemic that the regional government of Madrid had the idea of

315
00:19:39.471 --> 00:19:42.950
installing an operating with great pomp and ceremony.

316
00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:48.170
So many sanitizer jail dispensers on this subway take notes at

317
00:19:48.171 --> 00:19:51.440
the launching of the jail dispensers was attended by the vice president of the

318
00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:54.650
regional government himself Ignacio [inaudible].

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:05.810
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

320
00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:08.930
<v 1>See my friends when it comes to the crunch, Spanish politicians,</v>

321
00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:13.010
at least many of them don't really seem to know anything.

322
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.770
Take for example, what's happening with the schools.

323
00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:20.210
Spain is the only country in the world that has opened schools and to choose and

324
00:20:20.211 --> 00:20:24.380
universities with such a high rate of spread of the virus couldn't online.

325
00:20:24.381 --> 00:20:27.740
Education plans have been implemented temporarily as South Korea did.

326
00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.633
For example,

327
00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:32.420
does it make sense to risk a new uncontrolled spread that could clues companies

328
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.800
and businesses all because they couldn't put spoon or better stagger the return

329
00:20:36.801 --> 00:20:40.730
to classes just two weeks after the return to classes,

330
00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.830
many problems had already occurred.

331
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:47.320
<v 3>Isabel sailor minister of education confirms that are</v>

332
00:20:47.321 --> 00:20:52.300
2,852 classrooms under quarantine due to coronavirus

333
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:56.950
antenna, Tracy Noticias, Chivita president of the Navara region,

334
00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:58.000
wrongly orders,

335
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:02.200
lockdown of healthy students in Nevada and region while keeping Corona virus

336
00:21:02.201 --> 00:21:05.470
infected students in schools, El Espanol,

337
00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:10.690
a single positive in a classroom will not be a reason to quarantine students of

338
00:21:10.691 --> 00:21:15.430
primary, secondary, or baccalaureate education, law opinion. They Mircea.

339
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.320
<v 1>Really. You couldn't prepare an online alternative for those months</v>

340
00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:28.020
as clear that Spain is once again,

341
00:21:28.021 --> 00:21:30.960
the worst country for the spread of the coronavirus. And no,

342
00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.630
it's not something that has anything to do with public spending,

343
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.500
which is by the way, among the highest in the developed world. For example,

344
00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:40.440
Spain has an armed force of 120,000 people,

345
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:44.490
120,000 people who could have been used to carry out tracing case followups,

346
00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:45.690
testing, monitoring,

347
00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:49.650
or the installation of provisional COVID testing centers to reduce the pressure

348
00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.490
on health centers. But Nope, by the fall,

349
00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:57.480
all that has been done is to train 2000 military personnel to be tracers,

350
00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:01.890
to help regions that request it 2000 tracers for the whole of

351
00:22:01.891 --> 00:22:02.580
Spain,

352
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.820
not to mention this thousands of administrative officials who have been sitting

353
00:22:05.821 --> 00:22:08.790
on their thumbs during these months. Yes. Yes.

354
00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:12.150
So think ideally buying while they continue to collect their pay from the

355
00:22:12.151 --> 00:22:12.984
government.

356
00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:17.040
<v 3>Social security closes its offices to the public. ABC.</v>

357
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:21.600
<v 1>Obviously this is not a question of resources above all of agility.</v>

358
00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:22.470
Meanwhile,

359
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:26.250
in the face of such a serious situation with the worst numbers in the developed

360
00:22:26.251 --> 00:22:31.170
world and a second wave with the numbers of cases and deaths skyrocketing,

361
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.130
the main person responsible for managing the pandemic is engaged in activities

362
00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:38.280
that we can only best describe as

363
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:40.830
alternative.

364
00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:42.540
<v 3>But a nano Simone,</v>

365
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:47.070
a Saturday practicing surfing in Portugal in the middle of the wave of Corona

366
00:22:47.071 --> 00:22:48.240
virus outbreaks,

367
00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:52.890
ABC fender Simone caught diving in the sea of my

368
00:22:52.891 --> 00:22:55.650
Orca with Hazel's Kayla C O P E.

369
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:59.640
The director of the health alert and emergency coordination center found a

370
00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.620
Nando. Simone has been seen accompanied by the Mountaineer. Hey, Zeus.

371
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:08.430
[inaudible] with whom he is recording a chapter of the TV show Planeta.

372
00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:12.780
<v 1>I mean, having said that, I don't know, does this seem normal to you?</v>

373
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:17.280
Because to me it certainly doesn't of course these are not the only awkward

374
00:23:17.281 --> 00:23:20.430
moments where it's be difficult to describe what Simone has been up to during

375
00:23:20.431 --> 00:23:21.264
the pandemic.

376
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.943
<v 5>[Inaudible] [inaudible].</v>

377
00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:51.970
<v 1>Well, I don't know.</v>

378
00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.670
It might be funny if it were not for the fact that he's laughing and making

379
00:23:54.671 --> 00:23:59.080
jokes while contagion rates on the death tool just keeps growing it's all a

380
00:23:59.081 --> 00:24:01.750
little bit perverse. Well, the fact is that,

381
00:24:01.751 --> 00:24:04.360
has it been precisely the noses and actions of the authorities,

382
00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.910
both of the central government and the regional governments,

383
00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:10.900
which led to 20 Spanish public health experts and epidemiologists to request an

384
00:24:10.901 --> 00:24:13.600
external audit of the public management of the pandemic.

385
00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:17.920
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

386
00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:21.610
<v 1>A petition that was published in the procedure scientific magazine, the Lancet,</v>

387
00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:24.850
and was signed by important figures and the Spanish scientific community

388
00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.000
Megan's sloppiness and competence. I think, you know,

389
00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.360
you have a pretty good understanding why Spain is once again,

390
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:38.410
the worst country in the developed world and both health and economic terms,

391
00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.210
it was in this position during the first wave.

392
00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.690
And it is all set to do the same thing during the second.

393
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:47.380
Why on earth haven't Spanish politicians taken a look at the countries that have

394
00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:51.370
faced the pandemic relatively successfully countries like Taiwan, South Korea,

395
00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.130
Germany, or the Baltic countries among many others.

396
00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.100
All they had to do was copy the best practices.

397
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:02.800
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

398
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.100
<v 1>Having said that, what can we expect in the near future? Well,</v>

399
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:11.230
basically we are faced with two options that spin is simply leading a trend and

400
00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:12.520
that's in the matter of weeks,

401
00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:16.360
the whole of Europe will end up in a similarly bad situation or that Spain will

402
00:25:16.361 --> 00:25:19.090
have a much worse start to the autumn winter wave, none,

403
00:25:19.091 --> 00:25:20.860
its neighbors at the moment,

404
00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:25.060
it seems like the second possibility is the most likely here at visual politic,

405
00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:26.740
our crystal balls are all broken.

406
00:25:26.741 --> 00:25:29.320
And so we cannot predict which of these two things will happen.

407
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:32.410
But what we can predict is that with the current health data and the economic

408
00:25:32.411 --> 00:25:36.220
damage that is being produced to the Spanish people should reflect on this and

409
00:25:36.221 --> 00:25:38.620
the great financial crisis of 2008,

410
00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.550
they were among the worst effected and the 2015 deck races,

411
00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:47.590
they were at the back of the lane and know in 2020 a pandemic is here.

412
00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.650
And once again, they are the worst hit.

413
00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:55.240
That is a crisis every four years in which Spain, again, and again,

414
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:57.160
fears the worst. I don't know about you,

415
00:25:57.161 --> 00:26:01.270
but it looks to me like the model is failing. Doesn't it. And by the way,

416
00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.550
this is something that not only spins on citizens,

417
00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.980
but also those from all over Europe need to take.

418
00:26:05.981 --> 00:26:10.060
Note of the European union is rescuing these bungling policymakers with hundreds

419
00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:12.010
and hundreds of billions of years,

420
00:26:12.011 --> 00:26:15.760
but they're only making things worse and worse. Does that make sense?

421
00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:19.990
Shouldn't the youth Ortiz take action. Leave your opinion in the comments below.
