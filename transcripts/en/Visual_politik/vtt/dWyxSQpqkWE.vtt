00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.490
<v 0>This video is brought to you by news voice,</v>

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.550
the news is broken almost all of the U S media is owned by just a

3
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:13.290
handful of massive corporations. Fake news is obviously a huge problem as well.

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.350
And finding something unbiased can be really hard.

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.900
News voice is revolutionizing the news landscape.

as well as international and independent media giving some much needed balance.

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.340
Each new story shows multiple sources,

10
00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:31.920
which are all timed with their bias and perspective.

11
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.830

12
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.210
what we hear and what we read shapes, which people we trust, what we eat,

13
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.680
what we buy, how we vote,

14
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:44.700

<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

23
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.730
<v 0>It seems that anything could happen this year, 2020, for example,</v>

24
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.530
50 years after the Vietnam war, the United States army is returning to Vietnam,

25
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.800
but instead of going to attack Vietnamese communists this time,

26
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.560
they're going to defend them. Check the set.

<v 0>The socialist Republic of Vietnam is one of the few officially communist</v>

countries left.

32

And the world its flag is even red with a five pointed star in the middle and on

33
00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:52.700
its Northern border is the people's Republic of China,

34
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.390
which is also ruled by a single party. The communist party of China.

35
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.230
In other words, both countries have very similar political systems.

36
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.430
Both countries also began implementing free market reforms. In the 1980s,

37
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.100
both countries are home to the factories of the world.

38
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.020
Those countries share a common border.

39
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.400
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

40
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.540
<v 0>With so many things in common.</v>

41
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.280
You think that China and Vietnam would be natural allies, wouldn't you? Well,

42
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.260
my dear friends, official politics, nothing,

43
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.600
nothing could be further from the truth.

44
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.810
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

45
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.090
<v 2>Because Vietnam takes more assertive approach to the South.</v>

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.080
China sea Beijing tries to manage tensions South China morning post.

47
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.720
<v 0>If you have an idea and the last five years alone,</v>

48
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.320
the China and Vietnam have each launched several cyber attacks.

49
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.180
The last one was just a few months ago.

50
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.990
So Vietnamese hackers stole data about COVID 19 from the Chinese government.

51
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.500
Meanwhile, China was responsible for sinking some Vietnamese fishing boots.

52
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.450
The main reason was disputes about the control of some tiny islands and the

53
00:02:56.451 --> 00:03:00.310
South China sea that's right, some tiny at the end of this video,

54
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:04.330
you will understand why they are so important. And you'll say, well,

55
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.550
that's a very unbalanced conflict. Isn't the grant.

56
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.900
And there is some truth to that.

57
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.810
Vietnam is a country of more than 96 million people,

58
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.950
which has been growing at almost an average rate of 7% for 10 years. However,

59
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.600
these numbers pale in comparison to the more than 1 billion people in

60
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:24.480
China, As example,

61
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.990
the Chinese Navy has 59 submarines and 59 frigates.

62
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.680
The Vietnamese Navy has eight submarines and four frigates.

63
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.380
So what's the superpower propping up Vietnam. Well,

64
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.720
it's none other than uncle Sam.

65
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.890
And the question is why is there so much tension between Vietnam and China?

66
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.140
What is happening in the South China sea?

67
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.120
And how is it possible that United States,

68
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.620
which was Vietnam's worst enemy is becoming its best ally today.

69
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.620
We will answer all these questions, but first as always,

70
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.700
let's take a look at some history.

71
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.330
<v 1>Comrades of convenience and.</v>

72
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.860
<v 0>54 Vietnam became independent from not Britain as is usually the case,</v>

73
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.590
but France until then Vietnam, Laos,

74
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.860
and Cambodia had all been part of what was going on.

75
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.200
Then as French and or China after the Indochino war,

76
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.110
Vietnam was divided into two hubs, San Familia,

77
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.820
the communist North and the South,

78
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.510
which was an ally of the United States as it happened in the Korean peninsula,

79
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.250
a completely arbitrary dividing lane was used in this case. The 17th parallel,

80
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.690
as you can probably imagine,

81
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.470
the Northern communists led by who had the support of mouse, China,

82
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.110
and that support continued during the Vietnam war.

83
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.530
The one that we all know about the one where the North and South of Vietnam

84
00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:41.820
fought for total control of the country for a whopping 20 years,

85
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.940
As you knew,

86
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.720
the United States supported the South and China supported the North without a

87
00:04:51.721 --> 00:04:55.500
second thought to give you a rough idea over the course of the entire war.

88
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.860
China sent the communists in Vietnam, 560 tanks,

89
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:03.630
164 fighter planes and 1,922,000 pixels.

90
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.690
But none of this will surprise you. Well,

91
00:05:09.691 --> 00:05:13.110
it is logical that communist country like the people's Republic of China

92
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.520
supported the Vietcong.

93
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.330
And it would be logical to think that after the victory of communism in Vietnam,

94
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.210
China would become an ally of this country.

95
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.590
What should have been an unbreakable Alliance was cut short by this man.

96
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.730
<v 1>Better to kill an innocent by mistake than spare an enemy by mistake, whole pot,</v>

97
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.930
Cambodian dictator.

98
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.870
<v 0>Who you just saw on your screen as pulled pot.</v>

99
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.010
The man who ordered the greatest gen site and history and knew I am not

100
00:05:41.011 --> 00:05:45.510
exaggerating even a little bit POL pot established a communist dictatorship in

101
00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:48.470
Cambodia in 1976, the Camaro Rouge.

102
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.190
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

103
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.890
<v 0>Mayor Cruz believed that the only way to end capitalism was by eliminating all</v>

104
00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:01.970
of its institutions and the people who worked in them only in this way,

105
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.000
could a collectivist society be built from scratch.

106
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.990
Something like wiping the whole country and starting again. For example,

107
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.410
skilled teachers were accused of being intellectuals who perpetuated

108
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.910
individualistic ideas.

109
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.480
So the camera Rouge didn't hesitate and executing all of them.

110
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.230
And we're not just talking about teachers, businessmen, lawyers,

111
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.940
and fair title women, sec people,

112
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.170
basically everyone who was not useful for the society that POL pot wanted to

113
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:28.610
build was executed.

114
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.560
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

115
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.340
<v 0>In total,</v>

116
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.080
the Cambodian genocide wiped out almost 25% of the

117
00:06:38.081 --> 00:06:42.730
population, but take a deep breath. Let's get back to our story.

118
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.600
As you can imagine, China had also supported the Camaro Rouge in Cambodia.

119
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.020
And at first the Camaro Rouge also supported the Viet Cong.

120
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.410
They were all communists comrades fighting together against the oppressors of

121
00:06:53.411 --> 00:06:54.430
the waist. However,

122
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.820
have you think that having ideology in common is enough to form a lasting

123
00:06:57.821 --> 00:07:01.240
relationship, then boy or boy are you wrong?

124
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.280
The moment the United States left the region,

125
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.710
Paul part began to mistrust the Vietnamese.

126
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.580
The Camaro Rouge wanted a communist Cambodia, but in their own way,

127
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.990
they didn't want Vietnam,

128
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.370
which is a much larger country to get involved in their affairs pool pump began

129
00:07:15.371 --> 00:07:19.330
by purchasing all of the Camaro Rouge who had been drained in Vietnam and for

130
00:07:19.331 --> 00:07:23.880
such a fanatical man executing thousands of fellow party members was not

131
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.591
Cambodian.

132
00:07:29.591 --> 00:07:33.100
Camaro's engaged in a series of skirmishes on the border with the Vietnamese.

133
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:37.150
<v 1>So.</v>

134
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.330
<v 0>What did Vietnam do? Well in 1978,</v>

135
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.810
Vietnam invaded Cambodia and drove out to the Camaro Rouge.

136
00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.800
And this is where we have to take a step back to break down the partnerships we

137
00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:50.230
have in play here. Let's give you some background.

138
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.770
Vietnam was an ally of the Soviet union.

139
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.960
<v 1>But China.</v>

140
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.320
<v 0>Was moving away from the Kremlin because they wanted to maintain their</v>

141
00:07:59.321 --> 00:08:00.880
sovereignty. At the same time,

142
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:04.840
China was supporting Cambodia and beginning to establish diplomatic relations

143
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.100
with the United States.

144
00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.403
<v 1>Oh.</v>

145
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.463
<v 0>In other words,</v>

146
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:22.480
China could no longer allow Vietnam to invade Cambodia because Cambodia was

147
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.330
its ally. So in 1979,

148
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:30.080
China started a war with Vietnam from 1954 to 1979.

149
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.660
Vietnam was constantly at war first with the French then with the United States,

150
00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.050
then with Cambodia and finally with China. In fact,

151
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.680
it was precisely in these years that the gap between Marxists Lenise and Maoists

152
00:08:41.681 --> 00:08:44.860
was occurring all over the world. That is on the one hand,

153
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:48.490
there were communist parties that remained faithful to the USSR and other

154
00:08:48.491 --> 00:08:52.600
communist parties that defended the interests of China. To give you an idea.

155
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:57.030
The directors of the Chinese communist party were into various languages from

156
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:01.650
English to Spanish and sent to the Maoist parties of all countries around the

157
00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:02.040
globe.

158
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.270
And this way the militants knew what Beijing's possession was at any given

159
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.193
moment,

160
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.790
Example their attitude to Vietnam,

161
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:18.680
the Sino Vietnamese war left more than 60,000 dead on both sides and both

162
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:22.520
China and the United States put all kinds of trade sanctions on Vietnam.

163
00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:26.750
Meanwhile, Vietnam continued to invade Cambodia as an example,

164
00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:31.670
in 1986, every Cambodian minister had a Vietnamese advisor at his or her saints.

165
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.730
And a third of Vietnamese military spending was going on maintaining the

166
00:09:34.731 --> 00:09:37.490
occupation of Cambodia. In other words,

167
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.190
if you think that only European countries are created colonies,

168
00:09:40.191 --> 00:09:43.370
then you are wrong. Although let's be fair.

169
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:46.760
It is true that the Vietnamese army did dispose of the regime responsible for

170
00:09:46.761 --> 00:09:48.650
the greatest GeneSight in history.

171
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.960
Whereas when Europe came knocking and other places,

172
00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.080
usually that was the other way around the largest genocide, of course,

173
00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.320
in terms of the population of their country, but don't think for a second,

174
00:09:57.321 --> 00:10:00.950
but they brought freedom and democracy with them indeed until the mid 1980s,

175
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.430
the Vietnamese government followed Marxism Leninism to his protectable final

176
00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:07.030
consequences. And the Vietnamese economy was.

177
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:07.963
<v 1>The lumps.</v>

178
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.530
<v 0>All that changed in 1986 that year,</v>

179
00:10:15.531 --> 00:10:18.230
the more moderate factions of Vietnamese communism took power.

180
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.570
And that's how the policy of the DOI, again,

181
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.110
which we covered in another video basically [inaudible] was a program of free

182
00:10:24.111 --> 00:10:27.350
market reforms, similar to what Shayna was also doing at the table.

183
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.200
In addition to freeing up his economy,

184
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.260
Vietnam focused on improving its relations with the rest of the world.

185
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.490
All of this explains why in 1989, Vietnam pooled out of Cambodia,

186
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:44.960
gradually relations with China, improved in both Beijing and Hanoi.

187
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.000
They focused on economic growth and trade.

188
00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.240
And so they continued for decades collaborating on projects.

189
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:51.463
<v 1>This one</v>

190
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:59.450
cross border highway linking China in Vietnam concludes trial run trynna daily.

191
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:04.100
<v 0>That new story is from 2018. We're talking about highway that connects Hanoi,</v>

192
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.460
the capital of Vietnam with Kunming, which is a Southern Chinese city.

193
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:11.330
At the time. This highway was a symbol of reconciliation. Finally,

194
00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.380
these two countries,

195
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:16.550
which destiny was calling to understand each other were United by common route.

196
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.250
And you're probably thinking, well, problem solved there.

197
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:24.140
Where is this conflict now? Well, let's take a look at that right now.

198
00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.570
<v 1>Contentious islands.</v>

199
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:34.040
<v 0>Pay attention to this map here. We can see the South China sea.</v>

200
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:37.970
<v 1>Beautiful.</v>

201
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:38.241
<v 0>So far.</v>

202
00:11:38.241 --> 00:11:41.810
It seems pretty clear where each country's territorial waters reach the rest

203
00:11:41.811 --> 00:11:44.090
would be considered international waters, right?

204
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:50.060
Well, you are wrong. If we zoom in, we find a lot of tiny islands.

205
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.030
It looks a little bit like God sneezed on the map. Well,

206
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.080
these islands are the Spratley and parasail Island.

207
00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:01.590
<v 1>Actually.</v>

208
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.140
<v 0>Generally speaking, we couldn't even call them islands as such,</v>

209
00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:08.430
but as coral atolls and a tall is a ring shaped Island formed by you guessed it

210
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:10.530
coral. If you look closely at the photos,

211
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.940
you will see that the 130 coral a tools of the parcel islands have barely any

212
00:12:14.941 --> 00:12:15.774
surface areas.

213
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:20.850
An idea.

214
00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:25.230
The combined land territory of these islands is just 7.75 kilometers squared.

215
00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.850
And the highest point is 14.

216
00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:32.100
<v 1>Meters. Many of them.</v>

217
00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.290
<v 0>Couldn't even be walked on. However,</v>

218
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:38.640
technically they are territories and therefore susceptible to belonging to one

219
00:12:38.641 --> 00:12:43.560
country or another until 1932, it was assumed that they belonged to China.

220
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.680
Then they became part of French Indochina later,

221
00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:50.190
Japan invaded them and know their ownership is in dispute with China and

222
00:12:50.191 --> 00:12:53.370
neighboring countries. And I know at this point what you're probably thinking,

223
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.970
but who cares about coral atolls? I mean, apart from fish,

224
00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:59.370
obviously who's going to fight or something like that.

225
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.620
But the truth is that they matter a lot.

226
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:06.690
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

227
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.860
<v 0>First of all, there are no oil and gas deposits in the area. Therefore,</v>

228
00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.230
if these atolls are part of a country's territory,

229
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.580
that country can extract the oil in surrounding waters without any problem,

230
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:21.450
after all the oil is within their territorial waters,

231
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.330
but we're not just talking about oil. Think about it.

232
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.540
These islands are the perfect place to Poot military basis.

233
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.070
Have Shana took over the power of sale.

234
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.030
Islands could set up military ports to control all of the trades and the area.

235
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:37.320
Roughly one third of all international trade is concentrated in Southeast Asia.

236
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.570
It is one of the most booming areas in the world.

237
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.270
All those ships loaded with Apple AirPods, Samsung mobiles,

238
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.200
and so many other products made in Vietnam have to pass through here.

239
00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:50.400
But if China had a rule of military bases at the Gates of Vietnam,

240
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.980
it could block all exports and the blink.

241
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.473
<v 1>Aye.</v>

242
00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.870
<v 0>Vietnam has brought to late laws that say these islands belong to them.</v>

243
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:05.070
China has done the same and since no country recognizes the other's laws as the

244
00:14:05.071 --> 00:14:08.850
actions that matters. And that's why news Lincoln. This is so weird.

245

<v 1>Try not to build school and contested Paracel islands, BBC</v>

246
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:21.510

247
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.260
<v 0>At this point, I know what you're thinking. Hey, did they build those things?</v>

248
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:29.700
Didn't we say just a second ago,

249
00:14:29.701 --> 00:14:33.210
that these are coral atolls where there's hardly any from surface. Well,

250
00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:37.980
what the Chinese have done is start building artificial islands. For example,

251
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.400
one of these atolls is the so-called ferry cross reef. And this case,

252
00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.580
the satellite image shows how China has been covering the space in the center

253
00:14:44.581 --> 00:14:46.350
with sand brought in by ships.

254
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.010
<v 1>And a few years I.</v>

256
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:59.780
islands, islands that in some cases have been converted into missile silos.

257
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.010
According to many analysts,

258
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:04.640
it is almost impossible for China to build a large military base in the area,

259
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.230
the small land area and claim it,

260
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.310
make it virtually impossible to install large missile systems or military ports,

261
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.610
even SU and Vietnam. They are real.

262
00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.273

00:15:19.210 --> 00:15:21.790
<v 2>Breaks up. anti-China protests, UBC.</v>

264
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.730
<v 0>As you can imagine, these protests were not spontaneous.</v>

265
00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.100
They're supported by the Vietnamese government itself,

266
00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:28.630
but don't think that this is all a political.

267
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:33.220
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

268
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:37.810
<v 0>Mr. Xi Jinping and his Vietnamese counterpart yang food Trung do not get along,</v>

269
00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.500
but many Vietnamese fishermen have been attacked by Chinese bulls. In fact,

270
00:15:41.501 --> 00:15:45.040
in 2020 China even sunk a fishing boat in the parasail islands.

271
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.110
And we are not just talking about skirmishes.

272
00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.770
Chinese hackers have attacked the computer systems of the Vietnamese government

273
00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.720
and with the Corona virus crisis,

274
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:56.050
Vietnamese hackers did the same with China and this case,

275
00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.210
they wanted to get data on the pandemic.

276
00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:02.050
But as you might have figured out by now, no matter how many hackers Hanoi has,

277
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.510
they cannot compete with the hackers in Beijing.

278
00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:09.100
And that is why Vietnam is also leading the conflict by more civilized methods.

279
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:13.600
<v 1>Check this out. [inaudible].</v>

280
00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:17.320

281
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:21.670
<v 0>You can probably imagine what they're thinking about this in China. Oh no.</v>

282
00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.840
I'm so scared. Vietnam has reported those. We'll have to find a lawyer.

283
00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.620
Maybe we should stop building artificial islands. We might get a fame.

284
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.800
And it's this point that the game of alliances changes again,

285
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.980
pay attention here, because this is when it all starts happening.

286
00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:41.500
<v 2>The American friend.</v>

287
00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.390
<v 0>And the year 2000 Vietnam and the United States signed a trade agreement.</v>

288
00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:50.380
After decades of amnesty, these two countries were back on good terms.

289
00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.340
20 years later,

290
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:54.940
Apple is already manufacturing its airports and Vietnamese factories and

291
00:16:54.941 --> 00:16:58.570
thousands of Americans make business trips to set these like Hanoi or who G-Man

292
00:16:58.571 --> 00:17:01.570
city among others, this particular American citizen,

293
00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.040
whose name I'm sure you all.

294
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:04.263
<v 1>Nope.</v>

295
00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.440
<v 2>Trump says second summit with North Korea.</v>

296
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.350
Kim Jong UHIN will be in HANA and BC news.

297
00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.980
<v 0>The fact that Vietnam was chosen as the setting for this summit is no</v>

298
00:17:14.981 --> 00:17:16.840
coincidence. And it's four years in office.

299
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:21.430
Donald Trump has visited Vietnam twice and the Vietnamese diaspora loves

300
00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:24.250
Donald Trump to give you an idea. In 2016,

301
00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.790
the Pew research center carried out a survey in different countries asking about

302
00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.910
citizens' perception of capitalism. According to this survey,

303
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:34.480
the most pro capitalist country in the world is Vietnam.

304
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:35.560
According to this study,

305
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:39.700
the Vietnamese are more pro capitalist than the Americans themselves,

306
00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:43.600
but we are not only talking about ideology here too. There are concrete.

307
00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:44.553
<v 1>Actions.</v>

308
00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:48.730
<v 2>Aircraft carrier Roosevelt,</v>

309
00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:52.920
we'll Vietnam this week USNI news from July, 2020.

310
00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:57.260
<v 0>The second time in two years that an American aircraft carrier has docked in a</v>

311
00:17:57.261 --> 00:18:00.800
Vietnamese port. And this is striking because before 2018,

312
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:04.760
the last time a us aircraft carrier passed through the area was in the 1970s.

313
00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:06.200
So what is going on? Well,

314
00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:10.100
the reasons behind the United States sending aircraft carriers to Vietnam should

315
00:18:10.101 --> 00:18:13.040
be very clear. They are supporting Vietnam in the face.

316
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:14.450
<v 1>Of China's expansion</v>

317
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.380
[inaudible].

318
00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.910
<v 0>And as you can probably imagine,</v>

319
00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:23.120
Beijing has not been standing ably by just this summer.

320
00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:25.100
The Chinese army conducted Naval exercises.

321
00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:26.413
<v 1>In the area.</v>

322
00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:31.160
[inaudible].

323
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:35.000
<v 0>No mistake. This is not just a fate between Vietnam and China.</v>

324
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.760
There are many countries that are getting seriously frightened by the

325
00:18:37.761 --> 00:18:42.050
expansionism of Beijing, from Japan to India, to Taiwan. However,

326
00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.710
Vietnam could be a strategic ally for the United States. First,

327
00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:48.770
they are perfectly positioned to be able to install military bases and with

328
00:18:48.771 --> 00:18:50.660
which to control the area. In addition,

329
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.290
