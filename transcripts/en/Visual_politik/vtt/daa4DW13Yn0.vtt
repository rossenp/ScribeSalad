and you might even recognize one of the voiceover guys check out a note.

11
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.303
<v 2>The it.</v>

12
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.380
<v 0>The 25th of October, 2020 in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic,</v>

13
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.980
Chileans were called to vote for the national plebiscite of 2020,

14
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.430
our referendum, the asset ISANS if they wanted a new constitution to be written.

15
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.890
And if so, who they wanted to do it,

16
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.490
the referendum was far from being run of the mill for two reasons.

17
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.330
On the one hand,

18
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.300
the future of the country was to be decided to such an extent that the

19
00:00:56.301 --> 00:00:58.910
construction of a new Chilean Republic was at stake,

20
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.040
which would make it the sixth. And furthermore,

21
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.060
it would take place in the midst of a wave of unbridled violence. In fact,

22
00:01:05.061 --> 00:01:08.450
a few days before the vote, we were seeing news headlines like this one.

23
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.300
<v 1>Violent protests, resurgent Chile,</v>

24
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.680
two weeks before the referendum for a new constitution as BICE,

25
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.530
October 19th,

26
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.450
2022 churches set on fire in Santiago that she laid after a journey of protests,

27
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.313
your own news.

28
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.140
<v 0>And this is all not something recent or merely coincidental.</v>

29
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.230
The situation that has been going on in jelly for more than a year now has

30
00:01:30.231 --> 00:01:34.910
cleaned the lanes of at least 36 people and racked up almost 9,000 arrests so

31
00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:38.030
far. There's no end in sight for these disturbances, of course,

32
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.930
and lay out the results of the constitutional referendum in which more than 78%

33
00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:43.820
of the voters supported a new constitution.

34
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.990
It was seeing that the Chilean society seeks once and for all to turn the page

35
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.200
and re-establish social piece with a new Supreme charter.

36
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.370
So why did Chileans want a new constitution? What is wrong with the current one?

37
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.590
How does the constituent process work? And Chile,

38
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.530
is this really such a good time to launch, enter such a venture? Well,

39
00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:01.580
my friends and this video,

40
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.880
we are going to answer all of these questions and a bunch of other ones.

41
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:05.720
So let's go.

42
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.553
<v 2>Cracking.</v>

43
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.250
<v 0>There's. One thing that is undeniable is that under the term constitution,</v>

44
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.310
Chile has achieved the highest standards of development and living standards in

45
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.050
all of Latin America. Remember,

46
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.650
this is a region where poverty continues to be widespread and where things,

47
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.530
at least in the short term, unfortunately do not look good.

48
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.990
So the dilemma here would be as the economy.

49
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.320
The only thing that matters well for seven to 8% of Chileans,

50
00:02:39.321 --> 00:02:42.350
the answer seems to have been a clear and resenting. No,

51
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.130
the economy is not the only thing that matters. In fact,

52
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.800
the reasons for wanting a new constitution are very broad,

53
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.730
but we could summarize them in that the current constitution of 1980 was created

54
00:02:52.731 --> 00:02:56.450
by a brutal dictatorship. And we conceived with an authoritarian objective.

55
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.200
One that is very different from the political model of days,

56
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.430
Chile so much so that even president Sebastian Panetta and his party have

57
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:07.330
supported the approval, the vote in favor of change and this latest referendum.

58
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.430
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

59
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.910
<v 0>You see,</v>

60
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.510
despite the fact that the current constitution has received 31 modification

61
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.680
since being launched in 1980 with two of them quite significant in 1989 and

62
00:03:19.681 --> 00:03:23.730
2005, the truth is that the big dilemma seems to be an addition to parts of its

63
00:03:23.731 --> 00:03:24.180
content,

64
00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.260
the form by which it was approved and the political and social context in which

65
00:03:28.261 --> 00:03:31.290
it was written. And although it's true that under this constitution,

66
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.830
the vast majority of governments have been center left among them eight headed

67
00:03:34.831 --> 00:03:37.980
by the socialist Michelle battler and a more acceptable functioning of

68
00:03:37.981 --> 00:03:39.990
democratic institutions as being guaranteed.

69
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.750
The problem with the old constitution is above all.

70
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.500
And the state structures underpins structures that favor stability,

71
00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.760
but which make practically any substantial political reform, very complicated.

72
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.850
And these are reforms that would be fully accepted in other domains.

73
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.650
<v 2>In fact.</v>

74
00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.500
<v 0>The great political problems of Latin America is precisely this as a general</v>

75
00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:01.800
rule,

76
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.640
their constitution and laws have added social rights to their texts as protests

77
00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:06.180
have occurred,

78
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.140
but they have made sure not to touch the many political privileges accommodated

79
00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:14.940
for the elites were rigid elites that manage to stand fast generation after

80
00:04:14.941 --> 00:04:17.610
generation, but let's not get sidetracked here.

81
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.700
The point is the oldest change that has been set in motion in Chile is

82
00:04:20.701 --> 00:04:24.210
generating an enormous sea of doubts about what the new ultimate result of the

83
00:04:24.211 --> 00:04:27.750
Chilean constitution may be. Of course, before getting into this question,

84
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.710
it's a good idea to take a look at the current one from 1980,

85
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.170
to understand why the Chileans don't like it anymore. So my friends,

86
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.040
the question is as this next constitutional change justified, well,

87
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:39.503
let's take a look.

88
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.470
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

89
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.740
<v 1>The problems with the 1980 constitution.</v>

90
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.480
<v 0>If there is one thing that is controversial and disputed about the 1980</v>

91
00:04:51.481 --> 00:04:52.170
constitution,

92
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.980
which has created and promoted by the dictatorial murderous regime of Augusta

93
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.070
Pinochet is precisely it's legitimacy. Yes,

94
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.850
it is true in a way that their founding document was more or less legitimized

95
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.750
over time by way of a lot of modifications and the same way the Chilean

96
00:05:06.751 --> 00:05:10.350
constitution has also been the legal cover of different democratic governments.

97
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.380
But the reality is that the context of this document has never stopped being

98
00:05:13.381 --> 00:05:17.910
hurtful to many Chileans besides being controversial too. And in fact,

99
00:05:17.911 --> 00:05:21.240
some experts and temporary the feeling of the Chileans towards their basic law,

100
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.550
towards their national charter in this way.

101
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.700
<v 1>Like someone who owns a beautiful house,</v>

102
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.030
but he does not want it anymore because it was built by a father who is a

103
00:05:30.031 --> 00:05:33.000
rapist, does not a problem about the house itself.

104
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.990
The problem is that it was built by that father, Patricia Navea,

105
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.380
Latin American and Caribbean studies professor at New York university.

106
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.790
<v 0>In addition, the main idealogue of the 1980 constitution politician jurist,</v>

107
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.210
an academic Jaime Guzman designed it in a way that made it especially

108
00:05:48.211 --> 00:05:50.850
complicated to undertake our reaching political reforms

109
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.410
Guzman's objectives were therefore,

110
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.560
if not to conserve the totality of Pinochet's political regime,

111
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.590
once there was a change to maintain the structures, the design,

112
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.470
the shell of the state, as it was in fact,

113
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.830
one of Jaime Guzman's best known quotes regarding the objective of as

114
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.840
institutional construction is this one.

115
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.510
<v 1>The constitution must ensure that if adversaries come to govern,</v>

116
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.760
they are constrained to follow an action,

117
00:06:18.761 --> 00:06:21.640
not so different from the one that we would yearn for.

118
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.420
So that the range of alternatives that imposes on those in power are reduced

119
00:06:25.421 --> 00:06:28.810
enough as to make it extremely difficult to do other things. Hi,

120
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.200
Megan is Mon ideologists, the Chilean constitution.

121
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.210
<v 0>1980, sounds democratic, right?</v>

122
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.750
Not exactly a good example of all of this can be found in article nine.

123
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.290
The article is exceptional when it's compared to other constitutions around the

124
00:06:41.291 --> 00:06:41.680
world,

125
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.040
it talks specifically about terrorism and sets out a series of prohibitions.

126
00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.431
Remember,

127
00:06:45.431 --> 00:06:50.050
this is within the constitution itself for anyone who is declared a terrorist,

128
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.070
then it uses a reinforced majority law that determines under which assumptions

129
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.830
you are or are not declared a terrorist,

130
00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.040
but that the danger of the article is not just that.

131
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:04.510
Let me explain,

132
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.470
look at some of the prohibitions established for these alleged terrorists.

133
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.870
<v 1>Those responsible will be disqualified to exercise public functions or positions</v>

134
00:07:13.871 --> 00:07:15.490
for a period of 15 years,

135
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.320
whether or not they are popularly elected or as a director or director of an

136
00:07:20.321 --> 00:07:25.300
educational establishment or to exercise teaching functions in them to exploit a

137
00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:28.210
media or to be a director or administrator of it,

138
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.980
nor may they be leaders of political or education-related organizations or of a

139
00:07:32.981 --> 00:07:36.490
neighborhood professional business union student,

140
00:07:36.491 --> 00:07:40.990
or union character in general during said term article nine of the constitution

141
00:07:40.991 --> 00:07:41.500
of Chile.

142
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:46.240
<v 0>Now obviously no one here is in favor of terrorism nor of not condemning</v>

143
00:07:46.241 --> 00:07:51.100
terrorists. But the important question here is what is a terrorist?

144
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.580
Yes, well, that's exactly what the reinforced majority law sets out,

145
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.700
but the mere existence of that article is a window of opportunity for a

146
00:07:57.701 --> 00:08:00.730
political majority. To determine that terrorism, for example,

147
00:08:00.731 --> 00:08:05.050
is something very different from what we are all thinking terrorism actually is.

148
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:09.430
And of course the Pinochet regime had something very different in mind when they

149
00:08:09.431 --> 00:08:11.230
wrote this article, if necessary,

150
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.860
this legal construction could be used by an authoritarian president to eliminate

151
00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:17.260
from public life, not only the political opposition,

152
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.280
but also any dissident citizen depriving them of their public jobs of being

153
00:08:21.281 --> 00:08:24.580
teachers or exercising freedom of the press. For example,

154
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.930
it is just one example of how this constitution is rooted in a very different

155
00:08:28.931 --> 00:08:32.530
ideology than what we are used to seeing in more advanced democracies,

156
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.890
but actually thus far the worst aspect,

157
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.480
the power granted to the president is immense much greater than that,

158
00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:46.540
of any other unitary republics with a presidential list system,

159
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.560
to give you an example,

160
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.390
article 65 of the current Chilean constitution attributes exclusively to the

161
00:08:52.391 --> 00:08:55.980
president of the Republic to take the initiative and things like this.

162
00:08:56.670 --> 00:09:01.140
<v 1>Impose suppress reduce or forgive taxes of any kind or nature,</v>

163
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:06.060
create new public services or state funded jobs to fix modify grant

164
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:10.230
or increase salaries, retirement, pensions, mutual aid subsidies,

165
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.430
and any other kind of emoluments establish the modalities and procedures of

166
00:09:14.431 --> 00:09:18.300
collective bargaining establish or modify the rules on social security,

167
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.490
article 65 of the constitution of.

168
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.250
<v 0>Exactly, as it says, only the president can take the initiative to, for example,</v>

169
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.290
abolish attacks, raise it lower.

170
00:09:27.291 --> 00:09:31.100
It create a new one or modify pensions or social security rules.

171
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.470
And what if the president doesn't want to, well,

172
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.990
it can't be done wherever the parliament says,

173
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.100
this has its benefits and also severe drought.

174
00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:44.630
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

175
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.970
<v 0>For example, some supporters of the structure,</v>

176
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.320
including many libertarians argue that these exclusive initiatives are positive

177
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:55.670
and that they favor fiscal discipline as well as limit and avoid the political

178
00:09:55.671 --> 00:09:59.630
electoral conflicts that could affect many legislators because in Chile,

179
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.900
presidents cannot run for consecutive reelection. However,

180
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.140
it seems that the political and social majority is not so clear.

181
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:06.950
And in any case,

182
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.860
there are greater powers than those usually granted to the presidents of the

183
00:10:09.861 --> 00:10:11.360
most developed democracies,

184
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.240
because there's not a question of whether or not the president has a veto,

185
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:18.740
but rather that the entire initiative as exclusively has in any case,

186
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:22.130
what is clear beyond the political legal debate as, as we saw before.

187
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:26.060
But the 1980 constitution seems a clear reminiscence of another era where the

188
00:10:26.061 --> 00:10:29.900
president and authoritarian one at that had all the power. Nevertheless,

189
00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.020
what as a fact is that the Chileans are about to have a completely new

190
00:10:33.021 --> 00:10:36.110
constitution and the process to achieve it will be carried out through what is

191
00:10:36.111 --> 00:10:38.330
known as a constituent process. Now,

192
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:43.730
what is this process like and what are its limitations? Well, let's take a look.

193
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.100
<v 1>The Chilean constituent process.</v>

194
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.730
<v 0>My friends are visual politic and Chile.</v>

195
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.520
There are two types of organization that can draft a constitution.

196
00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:59.690
Once of course,

197
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.050
the initiative to have a new constitutional text is approved by referendum.

198
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.870
We are talking about what is known as the joint convention and the

199
00:11:05.871 --> 00:11:09.920
constitutional convention, which have some important differences. And in fact,

200
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.350
end those differences lies one of the greatest risks,

201
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.750
one of the greatest dangers that chili will soon face,

202
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.430
but we'll talk about that later.

203
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:22.070
The main difference between the Mex convention and the constitutional convention

204
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.720
is who elects its members.

205
00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:27.710
In the case of the Mex convention is composed of 172 constituents.

206
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:31.460
Half of them are parliamentarians elected by Congress and the other half are

207
00:11:31.461 --> 00:11:34.310
citizens elected by popular vote. And this case,

208
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.910
the famous rule of parity approved by law by both chambers of the national

209
00:11:37.911 --> 00:11:40.880
Congress requires that there be half men and half women,

210
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.400
but this only applies to constituents who are citizens,

211
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:48.140
not the parliamentarians in contrast the constitutional convention as 155

212
00:11:48.141 --> 00:11:52.400
members who are all citizens elected by popular vote and who must all be half

213
00:11:52.401 --> 00:11:53.680
male and have female.

214
00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.450
<v 3>[Inaudible] yes, [inaudible].</v>

215
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.030
<v 0>The option that won the national referendum of October,</v>

216
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.620
2020 was the constitutional convention.

217
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:21.030
So there'll be 155 citizens responsible for creating the new constitution.

218
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.120
As far as the operation of this constitutional convention goes,

219
00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:26.610
which to all effects is a constituent assembly.

220
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.600
It will have strong limitations both in time and on its scope of action.

221
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:35.130
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

222
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:38.460
<v 0>For example, once its members are elected and fully activated,</v>

223
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:42.330
the convention will have only nine months extendable by three more to draft the

224
00:12:42.331 --> 00:12:46.140
new text entirely from scratch and have it approved by a two thirds majority.

225
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.770
But that is,

226
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:51.090
they have a maximum of one year to draft and approve by a reinforced majority

227
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.580
each and every one of the articles, chapters,

228
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:57.840
and blocks of the new constitution. This is certainly a tight timeframe,

229
00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.050
which as we will see a little later poses, a significant risk.

230
00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:04.350
In addition,

231
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.980
the law establishes that the constitutional convention only dedicated itself to

232
00:13:07.981 --> 00:13:10.380
drafting of the new constitution and other words,

233
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.190
it may not interfere in any other matter of the state nor supplant or

234
00:13:14.191 --> 00:13:16.980
conditioned to legislative executive or judicial powers.

235
00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.520
And of course it must be governed by the rules that are currently enforced.

236
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.530
In other words, for the evil minded,

237
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.590
there is no room for what happened in Venezuela where the constituent assembly

238
00:13:25.591 --> 00:13:29.640
constituted in 2017 has since completely usurped to the powers of the national

239
00:13:29.641 --> 00:13:33.540
assembly, becoming a parallel and undemocratic legislative body. In addition,

240
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.380
once the final text of the new constitution is agreed upon and voted on by two

241
00:13:37.381 --> 00:13:41.040
thirds, citizens must endorse it. And what is known as an exit referendum,

242
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:44.250
which is basically a consultation for approval or rejection of the new

243
00:13:44.251 --> 00:13:45.030
constitution.

244
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:49.380
Now don't start the parade just yet because despite the legal guarantees that

245
00:13:49.381 --> 00:13:51.090
make the Chilean constitution process,

246
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.610
one of the cleanest and most advanced in Latin America,

247
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.570
the truth is that the risks of doing all this at precisely this point in time

248
00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:01.740
are many, and here is the enormous dilemma that exists in this whole issue.

249
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:06.540
And my friends believe me, this is perhaps the most dangerous point, listen up.

250
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:15.930
<v 2>Uh, high voltage, new constitution.</v>

251
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.500
<v 0>It is what it is.</v>

252
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.590
If there was one thing that will notably frame the process of writing this new

253
00:14:22.591 --> 00:14:26.940
constitutional text and Shelly right now is precisely it's social political and

254
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.160
no it's economic situation as well.

255
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.160
And the fact that the constitutional convention has been chosen as the method

256
00:14:32.161 --> 00:14:35.090
for carrying out and even more risk to this delicate game.

257
00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:43.260
Think about it for just one moment and the face of the outbreak of violence and

258
00:14:43.261 --> 00:14:44.094
mobilizations.

259
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.730
And now also the economic and social crisis produced by the Corona virus.

260
00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.120
The vote of the members of the constituent convention could be a real danger.

261
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.800
It's no secret that in times when societies are struggling are also times when

262
00:14:54.801 --> 00:14:58.340
radical movements have the most opportunity to achieve broad levels of power.

263
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.730
And of course the most significant risk that arises from this whole scenario is

264
00:15:01.731 --> 00:15:06.230
that Shalynn's with such a political situation and above all a social explosion

265
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.500
will elect a majority of constituents with very radical possessions,

266
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:13.400
perhaps very linked to what has become known in Latin America as 21st century.

267
00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:20.080
Can you imagine that people who defended the regime of Venezuela or the policies

268
00:15:20.081 --> 00:15:23.800
of the governments of Bolivia or Argentina, for example, may participate in,

269
00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:28.570
or may have even brought this whole process on this is not a minor question.

270
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:35.650
Being the exception in Latin America to a constant succession of great

271
00:15:35.651 --> 00:15:37.540
frustrations and broken dreams. Yes,

272
00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:41.080
the country has many problems such as a broken social mobility elevator,

273
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.120
or a poorly implemented pension system,

274
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:47.080
but still these problems are a far cry from what is the norm at a regional level

275
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.970
where things are obviously much,

276
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.420
much worse at the regional level generally has been a model of success,

277
00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:54.940
democracy and stability for the last three decades.

278
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.770
And the question we can ask ourselves as well,

279
00:15:56.771 --> 00:16:00.340
the new constitution guarantee that the essence of what is known as the Chilean

280
00:16:00.341 --> 00:16:04.210
model remains in place and be careful because it is very easy to promise all

281
00:16:04.211 --> 00:16:08.560
kinds of rates, but then to enforce them well, that is not so easy anymore.

282
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:09.190
What's more,

283
00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:12.280
the constant violence to which Chileans have had to become accustomed during the

284
00:16:12.281 --> 00:16:15.370
last year could be used by the radicals as a method of pressure against the

285
00:16:15.371 --> 00:16:18.250
citizens who are drafting the new constitution. On top of that,

286
00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.340
the short tightened limit of one year will force the constituents to be very

287
00:16:21.341 --> 00:16:23.620
quick and not to be each article too much.

288
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.890
If they want to have the full text approve on tape. In other words,

289
00:16:26.891 --> 00:16:30.370
we run the risk of trying to heal a wound by pouring boiling hydrogen peroxide

290
00:16:30.371 --> 00:16:34.150
on it. Something that is, of course not recommended a new constitution,

291
00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.470
undoubtedly was necessary,

292
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.350
but was this the best point in time to get down to business.

293
00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:42.130
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

294
00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.430
<v 0>And that is precisely why there is quite a lot of concern about what kind of</v>

295
00:16:45.431 --> 00:16:47.680
constitution may emerge from these conditions.

296
00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.890
It certainly does not seem that the new constitution will be orientated to limit

297
00:16:50.891 --> 00:16:54.400
the power of the state and its president as is the case with the United States,

298
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:55.000
for example,

299
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.150
but rather that it will end up being a text that gives the state enormous

300
00:16:58.151 --> 00:16:59.680
powers, many responsibilities,

301
00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:03.370
and a great deal of public intervention on a lot of issues concerning society

302
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.180
and the economy.

303
00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.870
It's easy to see that one wants to resemble countries like Sweden or Norway,

304
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.380
but isn't there a danger that it will end up looking more like the Argentinian

305
00:17:11.381 --> 00:17:15.580
model. All of this is not an easy process. The Scandinavian models demand a lot.

306
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.410
And I mean, a lot of competitiveness,

307
00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.430
something that the Chilean economy does not have. So the risk is on the table,

308
00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.270
but that said,

309
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.540
it's now over to you after understanding all the horrible things that chili went

310
00:17:25.541 --> 00:17:28.900
through in the 1980s, do you think that Shelly does need a new constitution?

311
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.870
Do you think now is the right time to launch a new national charter?

312
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.840
And what would you put in one, if you've got to design one from the bottom up,
