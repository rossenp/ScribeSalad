let's see what Josh has for us.

22
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.453
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

23
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.950
<v 2>2020 Is such a terrible year,</v>

24
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.100
but we can already start using it as a synonym for misfortune.

25
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.810
I'm a little 2020. My car is falling apart. That match was a 2020.

26
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.410
We lost the game by eight goals. However, as terrible as it has been this year,

27
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.900
it looks like we're going to end with some very good news.

28
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.270
There are at least two very promising vaccines already.

29
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.250
One from Pfizer BioEnTech and another from Moderna both are about 95% effective

30
00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:49.130
in early human trials. And by the time this video is uploaded,

31
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.100
they will probably have received emergency approval in the United States.

32
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.380
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

33
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.950
<v 2>This is much more than a light at the end of the pandemic tunnel. In addition,</v>

34
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.250
these two vaccines use a unique technology that could revolutionize the

35
00:02:04.251 --> 00:02:05.390
pharmaceutical world.

36
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.650
Both vaccines will be the first in history to use M R and a technology. Come on,

37
00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:13.040
we're talking about a giant leap in the history of science. In other words,

38
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.130
humanity is in luck and yet not everyone believes this stuff.

39
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:17.683
<v 1>Kate's listen up.</v>

40
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.520
<v 2>Percentage of Americans who say they would get a COVID 19 vaccine is falling.</v>

41
00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:29.540
CNN poll finds exactly many people in the United States and around the world.

42
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.180
Do not trust these new vaccines. The hold on just a second,

43
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.650
before you make any judgements,

44
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.460
many of these people are not anti-vaxxers by any means. In fact,

45
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.160
there is a legitimate concern about the safety of these vaccines.

46
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.300
In previous visual politic videos, we told you how most vaccines takes years,

47
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.220
even decades to be ready for the market.

48
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.650
And this is because of all the controls they have to go through.

49
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.280
This means that the COVID-19 vaccine could be approved in record time.

50
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.710
And it's understandable that many people are suspicious.

51
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.480
Many of them are informed people.

52
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.280
<v 1>Take a look. Why emergency COVID.</v>

53
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.370
<v 3>Vaccine approvals pose a dilemma for scientists.</v>

54
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.690
<v 2>Anti-vaxxers are having a field day. You know,</v>

55
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.430
those who think that vaccines are dangerous.

56
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.870
Many of them also think that the entire pandemic is a conspiracy,

57
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.370
a conspiracy created by big pharma in order to make money selling vaccines.

58
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.690
So the question is,

59
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.750
is this really going to be such a huge business for the pharmaceutical

60
00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:24.480
companies? Do we really have to worry about vaccine safety?

61
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.260
How is it possible that coronavirus vaccines have been released in record time

62
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.240
today? We're going to look at these questions,

63
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.100
but first let's look at a little history.

64
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.100
<v 1>Are we going to be Guinea pigs?</v>

65
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.610
<v 2>How is it possible that the Corona virus vaccine is appearing so soon?</v>

66
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.180
One good answer is the public support. It has received to give you an idea.

67
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.080
The white house has invested more than $18 billion in funding research and

68
00:03:49.081 --> 00:03:52.800
buying vaccines in advance. The European union has not been far behind,

69
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.010
more over almost all pharmaceutical companies and laboratories,

70
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.630
both public and private have jumped on.

71
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.503
<v 1>The bandwidth.</v>

72
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.810
<v 2>There are currently 198 vaccine candidates in the testing phase.</v>

73
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.330
We have never seen such a global effort to find a vaccine,

74
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.200
but this is not the only reason the creation of a vaccine has several phases.

75
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.110
The first is laboratory studies. Then come the animal tests,

76
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.380
the so-called preclinical trials, then come the human trials.

77
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.520
That is the clinical trials, which in turn are divided into three phases.

78
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.680
The first is with dozens of volunteers.

79
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.220
The second with hundreds and the third with thousands finally comes the

80
00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:30.150
manufacturing part,

81
00:04:30.151 --> 00:04:33.990
which is also very long because it is necessary to build a factory specifically

82
00:04:33.991 --> 00:04:34.770
for each vaccine.

83
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.280
We explained all of this in more detail in a video that I'll link for you in the

84
00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:40.500
description. Well, in order to reduce the timeline,

85
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.600
many laboratories have overlapped these phases.

86
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.520
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

87
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.500
<v 2>For example, in may of this year,</v>

88
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.070
Novavax started building a vaccine factory in the Czech Republic,

89
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.340
very close to Prague it's the vaccine has not yet been approved by the

90
00:04:56.341 --> 00:04:57.480
authorities. However,

91
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.950
they have already spent a whopping $160 million to build the factory.

92
00:05:01.951 --> 00:05:05.400
If the vaccine doesn't work, all of that money will be lost. However,

93
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.820
if they are approved, they will have vaccines ready to send to hospitals.

94
00:05:08.821 --> 00:05:11.910
The next day, something similar is happening with clinical trials.

95
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.100
There is no shortage of volunteers to participate.

96
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.220
Everyone wants to do their part to enter this pandemic, to give you an idea.

97
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.690
Pfizer needs 42,000 volunteers to test its vaccine and do they have already

98
00:05:21.691 --> 00:05:24.180
managed to complete half of the testing? And finally,

99
00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:26.610
the authorities are working as fast as they can.

100
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.010
In fact measures like this are being considered.

101
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.000
<v 3>Pfizer applies for emergency FDA approval for COVID 19 vaccine.</v>

102
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:38.310
<v 1>During.</v>

103
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.230
<v 3>The CEO says COVID 19 vaccine could get emergency approval in December.</v>

104
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.650
Okay?

105
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.380
<v 2>You say, what's the story with this emergency approval? Well,</v>

106
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.580
it's a legal body that was created in the United States in 2009 in emergency

107
00:05:50.581 --> 00:05:53.100
situations, us food and drug administration,

108
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.640
which is the authority in charge of health regulations can allow a drug to go to

109
00:05:56.641 --> 00:06:00.620
market, even if it is not completed or the clinical trials. For example,

110
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.510
this is the law that allowed COVID PCR tests to be used as early as February,

111
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.050
2020. It has also been used to test for other diseases such as the Zika virus.

112
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.880
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

113
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.840
<v 2>In these cases,</v>

114
00:06:13.841 --> 00:06:17.740
the FDA closely monitors who is taking these drugs and how the moment the

115
00:06:17.741 --> 00:06:20.980
slightest problem is detected. The emergency approval can be revoked.

116
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.600
And I know what many of you are going to say.

117
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.190
I don't want to be anyone's Guinea pig.

118
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.880
I don't want to get the vaccine until it's passed all the checks. In this case,

119
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.900
I can reassure you.

120
00:06:28.901 --> 00:06:32.620
It will be a long time before you will be able to get any vaccine against

121
00:06:32.621 --> 00:06:34.690
COVID-19 the first ones to get it.

122
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.020
Assuming that one of these vaccines received this emergency approval,

123
00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.330
would it be the United States health care providers?

124
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.120
So unless you are a healthcare worker in the United States,

125
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.570
you can be rest assured probably by the time you were eligible for the vaccine.

126
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.820
It will have been more than tested and studied.

127
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.450
That said the question some may be asking is what if this all was just a

128
00:06:52.451 --> 00:06:56.170
conspiracy by the pharmaceutical companies to become billionaires after all the

129
00:06:56.171 --> 00:06:59.560
whole world is waiting for the vaccine against COVID-19 we're the first to get

130
00:06:59.561 --> 00:07:02.080
their vaccine out, become the biggest company in the world. Well,

131
00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.820
right now we're going to have a look at that.

132
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.830
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

133
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.540
<v 2>Pfizer is going to make a fortune.</v>

134
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.290
This is a warning to all those who want to invest in the stock market without

135
00:07:14.291 --> 00:07:17.260
knowing much about finance. Be careful. Yes, indeed.

136
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.800
Being the first to get an approved coronavirus vaccine is good news for any

137
00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:23.830
company. The question is how good is that news? Well,

138
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.820
Pfizer announced that it had completed phase three of the trials of its vaccine

139
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.680
on 18th of November, 2020,

140
00:07:29.681 --> 00:07:33.130
the day before their shares were at $36 and four pimps.

141
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.850
At the time of making this video, they are at $37 and 24 pounds.

142
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:39.960
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

143
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.570
<v 2>So the month of March Pfizer has grown around 35% on the stock market.</v>

144
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.040
Of course, that is good news,

145
00:07:45.041 --> 00:07:48.790
but it is not the gold mine that many would have imagined. So why is that?

146
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.240
Shouldn't that trial success line them up for company of the year? Well,

147
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.010
let's take a look at these numbers at the moment.

148
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.640
The United States has already bought a lot of vaccines in advance from Pfizer.

149
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.140
In total, the white house has paid 1.9, $5 billion to this company.

150
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:05.590
It seems like a lot of money, but in reality, it's not such a huge figure.

151
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:10.150
If we compare it to the $16 billion Pfizer made in profit in 2019,

152
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:10.990
think about it.

153
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.600
Pfizer is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world,

154
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.390
Such successful drugs as Lipitor Celebrex, and the hugely famous Viagra.

155
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.800
In other words, the COVID-19 vaccine is just one more medicine on a long list,

156
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.870
but not only that, it may surprise you,

157
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.600
but the pharmaceutical business has more complications than it is.

158
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.470
<v 1>Of course.</v>

159
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.580
<v 2>Everyone needs medicine,</v>

160
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.060
but the research alone to bring in a new medicine to the market involves

161
00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:43.060
millions of dollars of investment and of all research projects,

162
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:46.690
only about 15% receive approval from the authorities. In other words,

163
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.600
most pharmaceutical research does not even reap benefits.

164
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.450
And what about the 15% of drugs that can be marketed? Well,

165
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.320
many of them have a shelf life of around 20 years,

166
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.410
20 years is the time the patent lasts before it expires.

167
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.830
And after that time patents are released and generic drugs can be manual.

168
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:02.813
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

169
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.810
<v 2>Viagra is one of Pfizer's biggest best sellers. However,</v>

170
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.940
after a lot of legal battles this year,

171
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.810
the patent has expired in the United States. Or this means that as of April,

172
00:09:14.811 --> 00:09:15.380
this year,

173
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:19.220
Pfizer will have to face the tough competition of the generic Viagra from other

174
00:09:19.221 --> 00:09:20.570
companies. For that reason,

175
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.810
Pfizer needs to be constantly taking out new patents. In fact,

176
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.830
the rise in Pfizer stock market price is not only explained why the COVID-19

177
00:09:27.831 --> 00:09:31.070
vaccine, this company is working to get other drugs approved as well,

178
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.920
such as a cure for breast cancer, which could be approved soon.

179
00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.960
And you're probably thinking, okay, okay,

180
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.330
perhaps Pfizer is not part of this conspiracy,

181
00:09:38.331 --> 00:09:40.200
but what can you tell me about Moderna?

182
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.710
Why has modernist share price gone through the roof?

183
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.380
Perhaps its vaccine is better than Pfizer's. Let's take a look.

184
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:50.000
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

185
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.820
<v 3>A star is born. If there's one lesson we can.</v>

186
00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:53.780
<v 2>From this story,</v>

187
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:57.260
it's that even the smallest companies can take on giants like Pfizer.

188
00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.730
This is the story of them.

189
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:02.690
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

190
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:05.780
<v 2>Upon a time in 2010 in Cambridge, Massachusetts,</v>

191
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.500
a small biotechnology startup was bought this company specialized in a

192
00:10:09.501 --> 00:10:10.041
technology,

193
00:10:10.041 --> 00:10:14.030
almost unknown at the time R N a this technology would make it possible to

194
00:10:14.031 --> 00:10:16.490
create synthetic cells with which to cure diseases.

195
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:20.240
And since this company was going to focus solely on researching MRI, RNA,

196
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:23.060
they decided to call their company Moderna mode.

197
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.410
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

198
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:31.400
<v 2>Harrison Pfizer is a huge company with dozens of patents to bits credit.</v>

199
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:36.280
They researched a lot of technology. I'd have 88,300 employees modern.

200
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.790
However, it specializes in a single technology and they only have 840 employees.

201
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.880
<v 1>The story.</v>

202
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.180
<v 2>If this company could be a story of failure until this year,</v>

203
00:10:47.181 --> 00:10:49.370
they hadn't released a single drug to the market.

204
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:54.080
That means that last year they made losses of more than $500 million yet their

205
00:10:54.081 --> 00:10:58.040
shareholders still trusted these guys. And that trust began to pay off in April.

206
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:01.610
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

207
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.240
<v 3>But during a submits application to advanced coronavirus vaccine testing.</v>

208
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.471
<v 2>We'll say, okay,</v>

209
00:11:06.471 --> 00:11:10.220
but how can such a small company compete with such a giant like Pfizer?

210
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.470
It stands to reason with so many losses,

211
00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:16.100
how can they possibly build a acting factory given how expensive such factor.

212
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:19.880
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

213
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.840
<v 3>Well Dharna and Lonza announced worldwide strategic collaboration to</v>

214
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:28.040
manufacturer Moderna's vaccine and RNA. One, two seven,

215
00:11:28.041 --> 00:11:30.320
three against novel coronavirus.

216
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:34.370
<v 2>Lonza is a Swiss company that manufacturers medicines, thanks to this agreement.</v>

217
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.490
Moderner provides its technology and Lonza the factories.

218
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.760
And this is how such a small company could bring out the product to take on the

219
00:11:40.761 --> 00:11:43.010
giants like Pfizer. And you'll probably say yes,

220
00:11:43.011 --> 00:11:46.670
but how is it possible that they have grown so much in the stock market? Well,

221
00:11:46.671 --> 00:11:47.504
that's very simple.

222
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.510
We're Donna has gone from having losses in the millions to having a product to

223
00:11:50.511 --> 00:11:52.820
sell and not just any product. In this case,

224
00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:57.850
the States has already bought $1.5 billion worth of doses for a company

225
00:11:57.851 --> 00:12:01.720
with a staff of 840 workers. This is a huge difference.

226
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.870
And this could explain why they have grown so much on the stock market,

227
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.880
but let's do a little recap at best.

228
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:11.620
Pfizer has said it can manufacture 1.5 billion doses of its vaccine by 2021.

229
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.490
And Madonna has said, it will be able to make about 750 million. In other words,

230
00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:18.640
we're talking about 2.2 billion doses of vaccine.

231
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:22.060
If we take into account that both of them are donor and Pfizer vaccines require

232
00:12:22.061 --> 00:12:22.894
two doses.

233
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.710
We're talking about 1.1 billion people who will be able to be vaccinated in

234
00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:31.150
2021. However, the world kind of has 7.8 billion inhabitants.

235
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.550
How are we going to be able to vaccinate all of them?

236
00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:34.493
<v 1>Let's see</v>

237
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.013
global.

238
00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:40.620
<v 2>Challenge,</v>

239
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.470
both the United States and the European union have already made massive

240
00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:44.790
purchases of vaccines.

241
00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:48.180
Some like Madonna and Pfizer seem to be on the verge of being approved.

242
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.110
Others such as AstraZeneca are less effective and may take longer in the coming

243
00:12:52.111 --> 00:12:54.780
months. New vaccines are likely to come onto the market.

244
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.790
Some may be better for certain population groups,

245
00:12:56.791 --> 00:12:59.340
such as the elderly or aesthetics, for example,

246
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:02.310
but the truth is that each country is starting to come up with its own

247
00:13:02.311 --> 00:13:03.144
vaccinations.

248
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.130
<v 1>[Inaudible] almost.</v>

249
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:12.060
<v 2>I agree on the essentials health workers will be vaccinated first, then elderly,</v>

250
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.570
who are at the greatest risk will be vaccinated. Then other groups at risk,

251
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.960
such as athletics will be treated finally, the rest of the world.

252
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.850
In other words, we will have to wait months,

253
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.880
even years until we all have the COVID-19 back.

254
00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.320
<v 1>[Inaudible] the question. The real question is.</v>

255
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.690
<v 2>What about developing countries? Of course,</v>

256
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:37.200
both the United States and Europe can't afford the vaccines. For example,

257
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.200
Europe is buying modern vaccines at $25 per unit,

258
00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:44.370
and the United States has negotiated a little better and is buying at $15 per

259
00:13:44.371 --> 00:13:47.820
unit. But what happens in countries that cannot afford such an outlay,

260
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.460
remember that we are not only talking about solidarity.

261
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:54.300
We are also talking about self-interest to be able to save that we have ended

262
00:13:54.301 --> 00:13:55.080
this pandemic,

263
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:58.830
that we can go back to traveling as before to doing businesses before we need to

264
00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.130
all be immunized. And that's where initiatives like this come in.

265
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:06.900
<v 1>Pillar aims to ensure that every country gets fair and equitable</v>

266
00:14:06.901 --> 00:14:10.890
access to eventual COVID-19 vaccines. Basically.

267
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:15.180
<v 2>The idea is for both private foundations and rich countries to put money into</v>

268
00:14:15.181 --> 00:14:16.980
creating a global vaccine fund,

269
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.520
these vaccines would then be distributed to all the countries of the world.

270
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:24.510
The goal is to have at least 2 billion people vaccinated by the end of 2021 in

271
00:14:24.511 --> 00:14:27.780
principle, this would be enough to end the acute phase of the pandemic.

272
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.900
If you take into account this mass vaccination campaign and the improved

273
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.730
treatments that will emerge in the coming months,

274
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.100
we will soon be able to return to our normal lives.

275
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:44.340
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

276
00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.091
<v 2>The question is,</v>

277
00:14:45.091 --> 00:14:48.570
do you think this massive vaccination campaign will be a reality by the end of

278
00:14:48.571 --> 00:14:49.381
2021?

279
00:14:49.381 --> 00:14:52.670
Do you think that all of these efforts will enough leave your answer in the

280
