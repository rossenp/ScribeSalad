00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.230
<v 0>Hi, my name's grant.</v>

2
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.960
And I'm the new host of visual politic and keeping with the theme of the

3
00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:06.780
channel. I'm British, I'm wearing a cool shirt and on bold,

4
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.410
you're all welcome on this episode, the ruthless world of biological weapons.

5
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.050
Should we worry? Is there a biological warfare threat?

6
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.813
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

7
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.490
<v 0>I'm going to tell you a story and I want you to think about whether this is a</v>

8
00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:28.850
real case or just some scifi movie, probably starring Nicholas cage,

9
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.270
Six places, and an important setting of several hundred thousand inhabitants.

10
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.270
I city nestled.

11
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.433
<v 1>On a day of day.</v>

12
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.100
<v 0>Fog, a ship appear suddenly on a stealthily hidden inside the car.</v>

13
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.833
<v 1>Folk.</v>

14
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.990
<v 0>And with an aerosol dispersed in Kennan,</v>

15
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.810
the ship starts expelling something strange into.

16
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.910
<v 1>The air. It turns out.</v>

17
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.100
<v 0>While they're dispensing is nothing less than by</v>

18
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.800
That's the end of my story. Is it real or is it not?

19
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.130
<v 1>Well.</v>

20
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.340
<v 0>I described to you isn't the beginning of any Saifai film or any experiment by</v>

21
00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:08.180
Dr. Mengele.

22
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.260
I'm telling you something that really happened in 1950 and the city involved

23
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.320
with San Francisco, which goes a long way to explaining why it's.

24
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.243
<v 1>Like that.</v>

25
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.490
<v 0>This army despairs over the city, over San Francisco, not once,</v>

26
00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:26.220
but at least six times the bacteria are bacillus subtilis and [inaudible]

27
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.570
Marston insists without the population of the setting. Knowing at that time,

28
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.480
these bacteria were not considered harmful to humans. However,

29
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.440
this experiment caused at least one person's death and the hospitalization of at

30
00:01:36.441 --> 00:01:37.274
least 10.

31
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.380
<v 1>What's more.</v>

32
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.960
<v 0>In the case of the bacteria. Massara Tara Marson sinensis.</v>

33
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.760
It was proven that it was harmful to health.

34
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.060
And the use of experiments of this type have meant that to this day,

35
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.820
as a bacteria, which is very resistant to antibiotics,

36
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.880
and that usually produces serious outbreaks with some frequency

37
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.500
at this point, I'm sure many of you are asking yourself a question.

38
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.820
Why on earth would the United States decide to fumigate its own population with

39
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.350
bacteria? What were they hoping to do?

40
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.130
<v 1>The keys phone.</v>

41
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.960
<v 0>And the biological weapons programs that United States put into action in 1943</v>

42
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.580
and for at least 20 years,

43
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.320
between 1949 and 1969 gem tests were conducted for war purposes,

44
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.870
which goes a long way to explaining why America is like that.

45
00:02:26.871 --> 00:02:29.720
Now your tests that were carried out on cities using the civilian population

46
00:02:29.721 --> 00:02:33.050
themselves as unwitting, Guinea pigs. Yes, yes.

47
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.470
<v 1>No.</v>

48
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.150
<v 0>The one think for a moment that they were the first,</v>

49
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.920
nor the last nor the pioneers,

50
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.630
it's something that's been in place for many years.

51
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.070
<v 1>Many years.</v>

52
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.530
<v 0>Want to know more about the ruthless world,</v>

53
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.150
biological weapons and the threat they can really pose.

54
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.500
Do you think that in today's world you're prepared to face a possible biological

55
00:02:54.501 --> 00:02:55.880
attack? Why don't you check.

56
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.743
<v 1>Okay. This video.</v>

57
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.790
<v 0>Biological weapons, the murkiest military history,</v>

58
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.000
before we begin this story, here's some light relief.

59
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.510
The development and experimentation of biological weapons has been been since

60
00:03:12.511 --> 00:03:17.280
1975 by the convention on the prohibition of the development

61
00:03:17.281 --> 00:03:19.650
production and stockpiling of bacteriological,

62
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.380
bacterial and toxin weapons and on their destruction.

63
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.650
That's what that agreement is known as always snappy these agreements.

64
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.590
<v 1>And practice.</v>

65
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.590
<v 0>The vast majority of the world's countries have stopped developing and</v>

66
00:03:31.591 --> 00:03:35.880
experimenting with them, which is new to them. But up until 1975,

67
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.710
the real several countries that developed,

68
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.760
and in some cases even use these types of weapons with some frequency.

69
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.600
We're talking mostly about the United States, the Soviet union and Japan,

70
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.300
And they weren't pioneers long before these powers launched their

71
00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:53.760
bacteriological development plans for military purposes,

72
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.850
biological weapons already had a long, long history.

73
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.930
First of biological weapons date back to at least the 16th century BC with the

74
00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:04.560
headaches.

75
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.980
There is also evidence that their common use as early as the fourth century BC,

76
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.680
when the site, the inspired, poisoned arrows, their enemies,

77
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.530
it was also a normal that it was common for the peasants, the Greeks,

78
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.190
and the Romans to poison the Wells and water sources of their enemies with dead

79
00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:19.680
animals that had been killed by infectious diseases.

80
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:23.340
Something similar was done with the talk tars in the 14th century,

81
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.900
they threw plague infected bodies on the general disease and cafes. Similarly,

82
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.010
the British gave blankets infected with smallpox to native American Indians and

83
00:04:32.011 --> 00:04:34.560
the 18th century. And on behalf of Britain would like to say, sorry,

84
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.050
that's something you're going to hear a lot during the course of these videos.

85
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.380
<v 1>But of course.</v>

86
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.860
<v 0>We don't have to go so far back in time to observe frequent use of biological</v>

87
00:04:43.861 --> 00:04:44.370
weapons.

88
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.300
Japan used this type of weaponry extensively during the first half of the 20th

89
00:04:48.301 --> 00:04:49.134
century.

90
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:51.060
<v 1>The.</v>

91
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.580
<v 0>Empire of Japan even had a specific unit,</v>

92
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.660
the seven three one to investigate the effects of certain bacteria and viruses

93
00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:58.950
on 11 prisoners.

94
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.550
These passages were then used indiscriminately during the Asian invasion

95
00:05:02.551 --> 00:05:06.320
campaigns. For example, in 1939,

96
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.650
Japan used the bacteria salmonella typhi to pollute water reservoirs in the

97
00:05:10.651 --> 00:05:11.790
former Soviet union.

98
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:14.160
<v 1>In fact.</v>

99
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.610
<v 0>As because of this history, because of this growing use of biological weapons,</v>

100
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.210
but United States established its own program in 1943,

101
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.100
right in the middle of world war II, a program that remained active for decades.

102
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.400
And that leaves the American power with the questionable distinction as the most

103
00:05:29.401 --> 00:05:32.670
advanced country in terms of biological warfare technology.

104
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.220
The question is at what price,

105
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.750
how did we get to that point? Well, hold onto your chair. And in my case,

106
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.510
hairpiece, because there's a lot to talk about here and you know what,

107
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.840
I'm pretty sure that some of you are in for a nasty shock.

108
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.350
If the story of what happened in San Francisco that we told you at the beginning

109
00:05:52.351 --> 00:05:56.760
of this video has already surprised you, what comes next is even worse.

110
00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:57.623
Let's take a loop.

111
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.810
[inaudible].

112
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:03.740
<v 1>Citizens.</v>

113
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.930
<v 2>Laboratory, Guinea, pigs.</v>

114
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.060
<v 1>The San Francisco.</v>

115
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.100
<v 0>Thing. Wasn't just a one-off right.</v>

116
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.963
<v 1>Can you believe it?</v>

117
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.050
<v 0>Because it States with biological weapons and also chemical weapons were</v>

118
00:06:17.051 --> 00:06:19.330
relatively common for years.

119
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.690
The main objective of these tests was to understand how the population would be

120
00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.200
affected and the spread of damage that the biological attack of the enemy or

121
00:06:26.201 --> 00:06:27.100
terrorists could have.

122
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.173
<v 1>Wow.</v>

123
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.560
<v 0>Is that to advance such research,</v>

124
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:37.180
the us military released bacteria that were considered harmless or an

125
00:06:37.181 --> 00:06:42.160
Oculus known as replacement agents, sometimes alongside chemicals as well.

126
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.600
And then the air was analyzed to understand how far and in what concentration

127
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.463
the agent.

128
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

129
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:51.430
<v 0>Definitely. However,</v>

130
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.020
some American field tests were not always particularly surgical or precise,

131
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.820
something that America has kept up to this

132
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.640
During 1957 and 1958,

133
00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.970
the U S army flew low altitude aircraft in areas such as St.

134
00:07:06.971 --> 00:07:08.080
Louis and Minnesota.

135
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.570
But that's the thing I'm mixture of Pat me himself and zinc,

136
00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:13.390
sulfate over urban areas. And for those of you who don't know,

137
00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.170
cadmium is toxic and carcinogenic, I should know that's how I lost my hair.

138
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.470
The point is that these experiments were conducted on a completely unprepared

139
00:07:20.471 --> 00:07:24.130
civilian population, mainly on black minority and low income neighborhoods.

140
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.030
<v 2>These aerosols could be spread over large areas.</v>

141
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.770
Submarines could release aerosols near coastal cities.

142
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.220
<v 0>But if you can believe it is not all and different parts of the country,</v>

143
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.810
similar experiments continue to take place until 1968,

144
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:51.100
1968. You can probably guess the consequences years later,

145
00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.340
several studies observed an increase in the incidents of various cancers in the

146
00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:56.200
areas where these experiments were conducted

147
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.050
And wait for the best part. When people questioned the strange clouds and Hayes,

148
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.050
the us government basically told people that those planes were actually

149
00:08:08.051 --> 00:08:11.560
conducting an experiment to cover the settees and a kind of fog that would hate

150
00:08:11.561 --> 00:08:14.650
these cities in the face of an airstrike. Oh my God,

151
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:19.060
who on earth can think of fumigating the civilian population from planes just to

152
00:08:19.061 --> 00:08:21.730
conduct an experiment. It's crazy. It is crazy.

153
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.860
But if this seems a radius to you,

154
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.850
wait till you see what they did in 1966 in New York city itself.

155
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:31.750
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

156
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.440
<v 0>Several experiments were conducted with the bacteria are bacillus subtilis on</v>

157
00:08:35.441 --> 00:08:38.530
the New York subway during rush hour. And this case,

158
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.530
the experiments consisted of lunging bacteria filled bulbs onto the tracks and

159
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:42.800
say,

160
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.540
the trains themselves are through the air ducts to see how far and how bluntly

161
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.600
our real biological attack could expand. If the subway were a target.

162
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.980
<v 1>These bulbs as broke, released.</v>

163
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.130
<v 0>Millions of bacteria into the air, not in many cases,</v>

164
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:03.270
entered the trains and were transported miles and miles through the subsoil of

165
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:03.780
the city.

166
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.620
The study found that if a biological attack had the New York subway as a target,

167
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.440
millions of people would be exposed to this disease.

168
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.050
Therefore the spread of the attack could reach most of them.

169
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:17.630
<v 1>Yes.</v>

170
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:18.560
<v 0>You heard that right?</v>

171
00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.040
Real tests with real bacteriological charges on the New York city,

172
00:09:22.041 --> 00:09:25.880
subway and instigated by the U S government. But then again, are you surprised?

173
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:30.380
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

174
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.110
<v 0>Just as impressed at the New York city hall, because far from morning,</v>

175
00:09:33.111 --> 00:09:35.950
the local authorities, it was not until 1980.

176
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:39.200
So the New York government became aware of these tests with bacteria in there.

177
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.380
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

178
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:48.560
<v 0>A couple of you will be thinking, okay, okay, let's see, this is terrible.</v>

179
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.800
And maybe, maybe reprehensible, but let's get to the point.

180
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:55.400
So I've all these exercises at least improve the United States ability to deal

181
00:09:55.401 --> 00:09:58.400
with a biological attack. How prepared is the country and the world to date,

182
00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:02.180
what's such an attack pose a global threat. Well, let's investigate.

183
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.670
<v 3>A reality check despite everything.</v>

184
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.350
<v 0>So is the U S ready? It will come as a surprise to absolutely. No.</v>

185
00:10:15.351 --> 00:10:17.420
One of the answer is not really.

186
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.240
If you think that all these experiments we've seen have made America truly

187
00:10:20.241 --> 00:10:23.750
prepared to deal with a real biological attack today, you are very wrong.

188
00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.900
At least that's what many of us biodefense experts say, listen up.

189
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.830
<v 3>The census that we haven't fully prepared if you've had an attack.</v>

190
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.040
And even if we had the treatment or the vaccine that everyone needed,

191
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:37.880
we don't have the capacity to get that to 330 million Americans,

192
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:40.760
us government official not authorized to speak on record.

193
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.170
<v 0>But how is it possible that a country that invests $6 billion in biodefense</v>

194
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.600
every year is not prepared for a biological attack?

195
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:50.670
<v 1>Well.</v>

196
00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.510
<v 0>Understand us. We will give you an example with smallpox,</v>

197
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.330
a deadly disease caused by the very of virus.

198
00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.160
There's already been eradicated in the wild,

199
00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.380
but which is preserved and laboratories,

200
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.350
especially in the U S and Russian laboratory.

201
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.500
The virus was suddenly released in a setting whether accidentally or

202
00:11:09.501 --> 00:11:13.430
intentionally its initial expansion would be virtually impossible to detect and

203
00:11:13.431 --> 00:11:16.820
stop since between the attack and the onset of the first symptoms.

204
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.420
There's an incubation period of several days during which the virus will be

205
00:11:20.421 --> 00:11:22.100
moving within the city at its leaf.

206
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:23.143
<v 1>Yes.</v>

207
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.300
<v 0>And then when you finally realized that biological attack has occurred,</v>

208
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.880
you could already have hundreds and hundreds, thousands,

209
00:11:31.881 --> 00:11:35.090
and thousands of people infected people who would suddenly become real

210
00:11:35.091 --> 00:11:38.840
biological weapons and their own rights they themselves would inadvertently

211
00:11:38.841 --> 00:11:41.240
spread the virus. And in fact, many more people

212
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:44.990
To give you an idea of their defenses.

213
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:48.770
The United States currently has a real stock of just over 15 million units of

214
00:11:48.771 --> 00:11:52.370
the smallpox vaccine. Vaccines are practically ready to use at any time,

215
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.600
but what this protect against a possible biological attack?

216
00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.340
Well, the truth is it's not at all clear.

217
00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:03.780
<v 1>You see.</v>

218
00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:07.080
<v 0>The time it would take to detect the virus will launch a massive vaccination</v>

219
00:12:07.081 --> 00:12:08.940
campaign in the effected city or region,

220
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:13.260
and actually vaccinate all its inhabitants would be considerable. Of course,

221
00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.380
during that period, the number of infections would continue to spread.

222
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.490
And this way, dozens,

223
00:12:17.491 --> 00:12:21.120
perhaps hundreds of thousands of people would become infected as a result of the

224
00:12:21.121 --> 00:12:22.050
biological attack.

225
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.800
Before the protective measures began to work more over an increasingly

226
00:12:25.801 --> 00:12:26.940
interconnected world,

227
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:30.750
it would be just a matter of days before the virus spreads across the country

228
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.100
and even across the globe.

229
00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:33.413
<v 1>Luke.</v>

230
00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:41.610
<v 0>Of course there are just over 15 million vaccines available and the whole of the</v>

231
00:12:41.611 --> 00:12:45.630
United States that means even in the country with the world's largest reserves,

232
00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.170
barely over 7% of the population could be vaccinated.

233
00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:51.870
<v 1>And still.</v>

234
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.840
<v 0>Is not. The only problem is that despite the 50 million stock,</v>

235
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.860
only 90,000 doses would be available for immediate use in a matter of days,

236
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.080
just 90,000 doses.

237
00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:03.930
<v 1>And the situation.</v>

238
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.580
<v 0>Is merit at the international level.</v>

239
00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:08.160
<v 1>To give you.</v>

240
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.450
<v 0>An idea is estimated that worldwide, there are 60 million more doses in stock.</v>

241
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:15.630
So imagine that as a result of a biological attack or an accident,

242
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.010
there was a global outbreak. It would be.

243
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:17.963
<v 1>Ridiculous.</v>

244
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.220
<v 0>Take into account that the interconnection between territories and countries is</v>

245
00:13:23.221 --> 00:13:26.580
now infinitely greater than at the time of any of the natural outbreaks of this

246
00:13:26.581 --> 00:13:28.020
virus before it was eradicated,

247
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.980
the results could actually pose a threat to humanity itself.

248
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:32.910
So what's my point here.

249
00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:36.960
SARS COVID 19 has just been a good example of the viruses ability to spread in

250
00:13:36.961 --> 00:13:37.794
our world today.

251
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:40.380
<v 1>But putting.</v>

252
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.210
<v 0>This really marquee SU site,</v>

253
00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.780
there is another issue that worries biosecurity experts just as much,

254
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.640
or if possible, even more.

255
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.450
I'm talking about the simplicity and cheekness of being able to genetically edit

256
00:13:51.451 --> 00:13:53.790
pathogens Lake of bacteria and viruses.

257
00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:56.910
<v 1>In recent years.</v>

258
00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.090
<v 0>Progress has been made in this area thanks to a new method of genetic editing</v>

259
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:00.990
called CRISPR.

260
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.560
There's a technique that allows genes to be edited much more accurately,

261
00:14:07.561 --> 00:14:08.100
quickly,

262
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.060
and also more cheaply than the genetic editing technology that existed up until

263
00:14:12.061 --> 00:14:12.894
a few years ago.

264
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.680
And he can consists mainly of using an enzyme called cast knife to cut the

265
00:14:19.681 --> 00:14:21.870
thread, the DNA sequence, wherever you want,

266
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.470
thus giving you the possibility of splicing new genetic material and to the gap

267
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.890
material that may belong to another completely different bacteria or virus.

268
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.560
So that features can be added or removed artificially.

269
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.530
Anyone who's seen the masterpiece that has the original Jurassic park will know

270
00:14:34.531 --> 00:14:35.670
exactly what I'm talking about.

271
00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:38.160
<v 1>It would.</v>

272
00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.680
<v 0>Be similar to taking some old trousers that no longer fits us,</v>

273
00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.650
cutting the fabric and putting in a piece in between them to make them bigger.

274
00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.650
Only that fabric can be of another completely different garment and with

275
00:14:46.651 --> 00:14:47.850
different characteristics.

276
00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.100
<v 1>However, this system has reduced.</v>

277
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.570
<v 0>Costs for the average cost of such operations being just over $3,000 on average</v>

278
00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.140
operations, that with old techniques would have cost much more. So come on.

279
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.900
These weapons don't require military budgets of hundreds, of billions,

280
00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:05.690
of dollars, nor hundreds of soldiers, nor fleets of drones,

281
00:15:05.691 --> 00:15:07.490
nor aircraft carriers, just alum,

282
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.580
and some small investment to create absolute chaos.

283
00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.550
It's not just a matter of reduced costs.

284
00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:19.630
This technique has also allowed the process to be shortened robotic 18 months to

285
00:15:19.631 --> 00:15:22.570
just over three weeks, three weeks.

286
00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.760
There's been a revolution in the field of biomedicine.

287
00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:29.410
One with very positive results.

288
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:31.960
<v 1>For example.</v>

289
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.230
<v 0>As reduced and simplified the modification of plant genomes to make them</v>

290
00:15:35.231 --> 00:15:36.790
resistant to pests and bacteria,

291
00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:39.880
thereby ensuring food security and many impoverished countries that are

292
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:41.350
constantly suffering from such disease.

293
00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:42.663
<v 1>Masters.</v>

294
00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:48.070
<v 0>Even though the existence of CRISPR CAS nine is undoubtedly positive.</v>

295
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:52.090
What really unsettles biosecurity experts is what could happen if this genetic

296
00:15:52.091 --> 00:15:55.480
editing system is used at advanced levels by the wrong people.

297
00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:57.880
<v 1>If a.</v>

298
00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.550
<v 0>Country or even on lone terrorist organization,</v>

299
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.390
secretly use this method to create genetically modified bacteria or viruses to

300
00:16:04.391 --> 00:16:05.320
make them more resistant,

301
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:09.070
more lethal or more contagious in order to use them as biological weapons,

302
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:12.880
we could be facing a challenge to biosecurity of astronomical magnet.

303
00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:19.720
Oh, the editing of genomes and viruses or bacteria is not an easy task.

304
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.560
CRISPR Castlemaine has simplified and shortened the process compared to older

305
00:16:23.561 --> 00:16:24.160
techniques.

306
00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.420
That is why it is essential to closely monitor who and what these techniques are

307
00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.463
using.

308
00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.680
See if we've learned anything from the SARS COVID 19 coronavirus pandemic. Okay.

309
00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:40.090
So that's even the country's supposedly best equipped and biosecurity can suffer

310
00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.080
catastrophic.

311
00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.360
That's precisely why many of us are wondering,

312
00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.600
could the world today be more vulnerable than ever to biological threats?

313
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.910
What measures should we take to try and control this threat?

314
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.690
Do you think your country could be overcome a large-scale biological attack as

315
00:16:55.691 --> 00:16:58.420
