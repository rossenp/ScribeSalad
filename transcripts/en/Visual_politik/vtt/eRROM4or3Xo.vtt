00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.530
<v 0>This video is brought to you by news voice, the news is broken.</v>

2
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.270
<v 1>All us media is owned by just a handful of big corporations.</v>

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.130
Fake news is obviously a huge problem as well.

4
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.380
And finding something and biased can be really hard.

5
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.960
News voice is revolutionizing the news landscape.

as well as international and independent media giving some much needed balance.

9
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.010
Each new story shows multiple sources,

10
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.500
which are all tagged with their bias and perspective.

11
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.660

12
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.290
what we hear and what we read shapes, which persons we trust, what we eat,

13
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.820
what we buy, how we vote,

14
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.570

21
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.880
<v 0>Friends.</v>

22
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.690
<v 1>The story you're about to see is not the script of an Eastern European spy film.</v>

23
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.980
It is what has happened and what is happening today in the heart of Russian

24
00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:24.800
politics. And the fact is that to the Russian Federation,

25
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.100
the country of [inaudible] vodka and the mythical Kalinka song,

26
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.370
we could just as easily add poison to that list of the country's defining

27
00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:34.520
features. Yes, yes, that's right poison by now.

28
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.040
I'm pretty sure that you have all heard stories like this.

29
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.590
<v 0>Russia's Navani fell ill after drinking from poisoned water bottle in his hotel</v>

30
00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:43.850
room eight, say CNN.

31
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.440
<v 1>Alex say Navani who we discussed not long ago on visual politic has basically</v>

32
00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:52.580
become the main enemy of president Vladimir Putin within contemporary Russian

33
00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:56.270
politics and enemy who Putin has become more and more obsessed with.

34
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.720
As this character has been able to unite to the opposition and create what is

35
00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:04.130
possibly the strongest alternative to the Russian ruler in a long, long time,

36
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.670
by the way,

37
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.670
I'll leave the link to the video that we made recently about Navani in the

38
00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:08.690
description below. Well,

39
00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:12.350
the point is that daring to confront the powerful Vladimir Putin has its risks

40
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.920
in a country where the rule of law is virtually absent and the secret services

41
00:02:15.921 --> 00:02:16.880
do as they please,

42
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.820
it should come as no surprise that the elimination of opponents is.

43
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:20.743
<v 0>Commonplace.</v>

44
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.740
<v 1>Think about attacks against influential people, such as politicians,</v>

45
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.550
journalists, activists, and even artists who do not agree with the government.

46
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.400
And remember that these attacks don't only happen on Russian soil,

47
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.443
but also abroad.

48
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.320
Many of you probably remember the case of the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia

49
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.670
scrip pal in Saulsbury,

50
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.620
UK by two Russian agents in 2018 and attack for which they used a nerve agent

51
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:48.890
called a two, three, four from the novel shock group. In other words,

52
00:02:48.891 --> 00:02:52.130
we're talking about the fact that we have witnessed real chemical weapon

53
00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:52.910
attacks.

54
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:53.743
<v 0>Foreign soil.</v>

55
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.410
<v 1>I don't think for a moment that this poisoning is something new in mother,</v>

56
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:01.030
Russia, not at all. In fact,

57
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.750
these techniques have been part of the politics of this country for much longer

58
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.680
than you might think to give you a couple of examples. In 1453,

59
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.790
Prince Dimitri sham Yucca was eliminated by poisoning when his chicken dinner

60
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:14.770
was laced with arsenic in 16, 10,

61
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.700
another Russian Prince Mikayla's scorpion shoe whiskey was poisoned by his own

62
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:21.220
wife because the SAR considered him a threat.

63
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.330
And the truth is that since then poisoning has been a constant in Russia and in

64
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.110
factually reached an age of excellence with the arrival of the Soviet union.

65
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.113
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

66
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.750
<v 1>Lennon himself,</v>

67
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.320
the father of the Russian Bolshevik movement promoted the creation of a network

68
00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:43.170
of secret laboratories to research and develop new poisons.

69
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.110
And then during the Stalin era, many more were added.

70
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.500
The most famous was lab X popularly known as Camaro.

71
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.280
The initial objective of these laboratories was to test and perfect existing

72
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.370
poisons and objective for which they did not hesitate in using life.

73
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.760
Prisoners held in their GoogleX, who were poisoned with mustard, gas,

74
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.440
rice in digit, in Cura and cyanide among many other toxic agents.

75
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.610
All of this following closely the style of Dr. Mengele or the Japanese seven

76
00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:09.630
three one squadron

77
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.210
And take notes because once they had the knowledge and the capacity,

78
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.780
what is possibly one of the most horrible and frightening arms races of the

79
00:04:18.781 --> 00:04:22.350
entire Soviet era was set in motion, the chemical weapons race.

80
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.303
<v 0>Listen up</v>

81
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.590
the Soviets shadiest heritage.

82
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.403
One question.

83
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.280
<v 1>Why are poisons used against the opposition so frequently in Russia? Well,</v>

84
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.850
I'm sure it's pretty obvious to make sure the obstacle is fully eliminated,

85
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.450
but why use poisons and toxic agents instead of other methods? Well,

86
00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:46.410
think about it for a moment.

87
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.430
We're talking about the fast silent method with effects on the human body that

88
00:04:50.431 --> 00:04:52.800
mimic those of a natural death. And in fact,

89
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.250
progress in the creation of lethal substances that could go completely

90
00:04:56.251 --> 00:04:58.380
undetected advanced very, very quickly.

91
00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.273
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

92
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.460
<v 1>1928 And 1935,</v>

93
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.340
the secret Soviet laboratories of biochemist Grigory,

94
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.080
[inaudible] managed to create a wide catalog of tasteless, colorless, odorless,

95
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.650
and lethal poisons that could be poured into food or drink without the victim

96
00:05:16.651 --> 00:05:18.030
being aware of their presence.

97
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.300
Thanks to the advances he was making Myra Navasky became part of the team,

98
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.500
or [inaudible] an agent of the Soviet and KVD secret service,

99
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.100
which was dedicated to executing anyone, considered an enemy of the state.

100
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.323
<v 0>State.</v>

101
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.510
<v 1>And this in fact was what allowed Sue to play it off and its team to change</v>

102
00:05:36.511 --> 00:05:37.620
their modus operandi.

103
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.190
They played with bizarre methods like giving away boxes of chocolates containing

104
00:05:41.191 --> 00:05:41.850
explosives,

105
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.210
just simply spicing up an enemy's food or drink with one of their custom

106
00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:48.060
poisons. It was so simple that they quickly got the hang of it.

107
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.810
And poisoning became one of the main methods of annihilation against dissent in

108
00:05:51.811 --> 00:05:54.300
the Soviet union. By the way, after Stalin's death,

109
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.680
suitor plateau was arrested in the context of stylization.

110
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.300
He spent 15 years in prison.

111
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.810
Of course the Soviets were well aware that such methods were effective.

112
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.490
So despite their condemnation,

113
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.360
it didn't take them long to devote more and more resources to developing new

114
00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:11.360
substances, which were becoming more potent and more difficult to treat.

115
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.573
<v 0>Right.</v>

116
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.180
<v 1>But why on earth? Did they need other poisons, more discrete ones? Well,</v>

117
00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.600
friends, the answer to this question is given by historian Boris [inaudible].

118
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.890
<v 2>They must make the victim's debts or illness appear natural,</v>

119
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.130
or at least produce symptoms that will baffled doctors and forensic

120
00:06:30.131 --> 00:06:31.660
investigators. To this end,

121
00:06:31.661 --> 00:06:36.160
to the Camaro developed its defining specialty combining known poisons into

122
00:06:36.161 --> 00:06:39.790
original and untraceable forms, Loris Villa Dark-Sky.

123
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.710
<v 1>Of course, as the poisons advanced.</v>

124
00:06:41.711 --> 00:06:44.920
So did medical and forensic techniques as we've doping in sport,

125
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.040
it was a struggle, a continuous effort to stay. One step ahead,

126
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.270
fast began a whole race to develop poisons more and more secretively up until

127
00:06:52.271 --> 00:06:53.104
that point. However,

128
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.290
it had remained relatively common to use methods such as polonium two,

129
00:06:56.291 --> 00:07:00.070
one Oh a toxic substance that leaves a wide trail of radioactive contamination

130
00:07:00.071 --> 00:07:03.280
that is easy to track with a Geiger counter that led the Soviets to launch a

131
00:07:03.281 --> 00:07:07.090
nerve agent development program that was unique in the world. In the 1980s,

132
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.840
friends falling into is born the program that created the dreaded Nova chalk

133
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.730
agents Over chalk,

134
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.150
which literally means newcomer in Russian is a group of highly lethal

135
00:07:19.151 --> 00:07:23.410
neurotoxins developed by Soviet scientists in laboratories in Northern Catholic.

136
00:07:23.411 --> 00:07:28.330
Stan is Pakistan and in Russia itself carried in the form of a liquid powder or

137
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.960
aerosol.

138
00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.650
They are extremely easy poisons to transport to another country in order to

139
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.310
eliminate even exiled dissonance without being detected at international

140
00:07:36.311 --> 00:07:36.880
borders.

141
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.260
This group of poisons inhibits Colin Estrace like attacking neuro-transmitters,

142
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.890
which are substances in the nerve cells that regulates the essential functions

143
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.580
of the body.

144
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.180
This causes a failure in an essential organ that can be masked as a coincidental

145
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.320
illness. In addition,

146
00:07:50.321 --> 00:07:54.070
these poisons have the advantage that depending on the dose used conserve both

147
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.890
to end life or to scare rivals with warnings,

148
00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.260
that is to cause harm without eliminating the

149
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.980
Who could prove in Soviet times that the cause of the ailment was the workings

150
00:08:05.981 --> 00:08:10.000
of the state. And not just a sudden illness, I assure you that no one could,

151
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.660
this is why no one knows exactly how many people the USSR could have been

152
00:08:13.661 --> 00:08:17.770
employed with this type of secret operation against opponents and dissidents.

153
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.900
But friends, let's be very clear about one thing,

154
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:22.900
the programs and equipment to carry out these operations existed.

155
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.540
So surely the victim tally is in the thousands.

156
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.051
Any case.

157
00:08:29.051 --> 00:08:33.730
What is clear is that today this modus operandi is alive and well in Putin's

158
00:08:33.731 --> 00:08:34.690
Russia as well,

159
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.500
either because he is a tough guy or because he's a former KGB agent.

160
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.680
It seems that the Russian president loves to break out the poisons to prove that

161
00:08:41.681 --> 00:08:45.340
you are either with him or against him. And in fact, the FSB,

162
00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:49.390
the Russian federal security service has inherited not only the structures,

163
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.040
but also the methods of the KGB.

164
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.070
And no one seems able or to want to do anything about it.

165
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.510
But how is it possible that in the 21st century and with all the medical

166
00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:01.170
advances that have been made this archaic and ancient method of eliminating

167
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.480
adversaries still exists. And another question,

168
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:07.350
is there any reaction or resistance in Russian society when such a case comes to

169
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:08.184
light? Well.

170
00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:20.420
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

171
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.490
<v 1>New Russia, old habits.</v>

172
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:27.710
If there is one thing Putin likes to show off to his friends,

173
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.960
it is surely the fact that no one can touch him.

174
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.740
The events within an outside Russia under the presidency of this new species of

175
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.700
SAR shows us that his methods and his mentality have not stopped evolving every

176
00:09:37.701 --> 00:09:39.740
year that he has been at the helm of the Kremlin,

177
00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:43.940
the factors that Putin who first became president of Russia back in 1999,

178
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.510
and since then has not relinquished power has been crossing more and more

179
00:09:47.511 --> 00:09:50.780
ethical and moral lines. For example, in 2004,

180
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:55.430
Russia poisoned the former president of Ukraine pro European Victor U Shanko.

181
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:57.500
When he was in the middle of his election campaign.

182
00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:01.760
This was discovered after you Shanko suddenly developed acute pancreatitis as a

183
00:10:01.761 --> 00:10:04.160
result, doctors in Vienna, where he was treated,

184
00:10:04.161 --> 00:10:07.670
discovered such high levels of TCD dioxin in his body,

185
00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.240
that it became the second highest level ever measured in a human being.

186
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.700
A couple of years later, Alexander Litvinenko,

187
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.960
a former KGB agent residing in London who was anti Putin died of radioactive

188
00:10:17.961 --> 00:10:19.070
poisoning. Of course,

189
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.310
in order to understand the possible relationship between this event and the

190
00:10:22.311 --> 00:10:25.970
Russian government, you have to go back one month to October, 2006,

191
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.080
when Russian journalist,

192
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.350
Anna Pollitt coughs Gaia was shot in the elevator of her apartment.

193
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:35.780
<v 0>It.</v>

194
00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:39.860
<v 1>Yeah, it was an anti Putin journalist who always got around threats, censorship,</v>

195
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.210
and all the other obstacles,

196
00:10:41.211 --> 00:10:43.610
the Russian government put in the way of doing her job.

197
00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.630
That was until she started investigating Putin's crimes in the Chechnya and

198
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.290
various corruption cases that apparently made her a priority targets.

199
00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:56.180
One that had to be silenced. And in fact, all those Ubers killed in October,

200
00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:56.210
2006,

201
00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:00.380
a couple of years before that she had been poisoned on an Aeroflot flight with a

202
00:11:00.381 --> 00:11:02.810
poison that remains undetermined to this day.

203
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.530
The journalist began to feel very unwell after drinking tea on board the

204
00:11:06.531 --> 00:11:08.300
aircraft. However, in that case,

205
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.540
the prompt actions of the crew and an emergency landing safe.

206
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.943
<v 0>Life.</v>

207
00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:19.400
<v 1>The fact is that Alexander Litvinenko decided from London to investigate the</v>

208
00:11:19.401 --> 00:11:24.140
strange circumstances of Politkovskaya his death in the elevator of her house.

209
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.460
And only a month later,

210
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:30.110
he himself died from poisoning the method polonium 200 poisoning after

211
00:11:30.111 --> 00:11:33.800
meeting with two Russians in a London hotel who were allegedly business

212
00:11:33.801 --> 00:11:37.610
contacts, the trace of radio activity, however, was left all over the room.

213
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.510
And not only that,

214
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:42.260
but also on the stairs of the hotel and in a nearby discotheque where the

215
00:11:42.261 --> 00:11:46.070
Russian agents had been a towel loaded with radioactivity even turned up in the

216
00:11:46.071 --> 00:11:46.580
laundry.

217
00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.090
All these traces in fact were precisely what it helps Scotland yard to know

218
00:11:50.091 --> 00:11:53.060
where the killers had been and when the poisoning had occurred.

219
00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:59.670
However, if what you've heard already seemed serious,

220
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.150
the truth is that since then, things have only gotten worse. For example,

221
00:12:03.151 --> 00:12:05.880
an activist and journalist who has spoken out against Putin,

222
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:09.990
Vladimir Kara Mercer has been poisoned twice once in 2015, and again,

223
00:12:09.991 --> 00:12:13.680
in 2017 becoming seriously ill POS of a seal, a, right?

224
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.850
Activists suddenly lost his sight hearing and mobility in 2018 and was later

225
00:12:17.851 --> 00:12:21.510
confirmed as having been poisoned when he traveled to Germany for treatment in

226
00:12:21.511 --> 00:12:22.200
the same year,

227
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.950
Sergei and Yulia ScripPal were poisoned with a nerve agent from the novice shock

228
00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.980
group in Salisbury, UK, as we mentioned at the beginning of this video.

229
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.070
And most recently, as you all know, there is the case of Alexa.

230
00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.053
<v 0>And Elvani.</v>

231
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:37.981
<v 1>As you can see,</v>

232
00:12:37.981 --> 00:12:42.420
this is a long list of known cases that has escalated in the last five years.

233
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.050
And that's without counting the cases of poisoning within the country itself and

234
00:12:46.051 --> 00:12:49.050
carried out on people, not as prominent as the opposition leader.

235
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:52.050
Let's just say that what happens in Russia stays in Russia.

236
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:56.130
<v 2>One of poisons, great virtues for the politically minded murderers,</v>

237
00:12:56.131 --> 00:13:00.330
their capacity to combine easy deniability and vicious theatricality.

238
00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:04.110
Even while the murder denies any role, perhaps with a sly wink,

239
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.140
the victim dies a horrific and often lengthy death,

240
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.360
a message in a poison bottle, Mark Delhi,

241
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:13.890
Opti senior associate fellow at the Royal United services Institute.

242
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:15.030
<v 1>Friends.</v>

243
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:19.140
One key factor that runs throughout this story is that the cases we know about

244
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.830
we only know about because they either occurred outside of Russia,

245
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.770
all the victims managed to go abroad for medical treatment.

246
00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:29.880
How many more cases can go undetected within Russia itself? It is difficult,

247
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:34.410
very difficult, practically impossible to find out, but okay, at this point,

248
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.660
the question that comes up is, and in the meantime,

249
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.880
what does the Russian government make of all this?

250
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:44.130
<v 0>Well, you can probably.</v>

251
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.640
<v 1>The imagine of course they know nothing. And certainly what the instigators,</v>

252
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.290
maybe it was the work of a personal enemy,

253
00:13:49.291 --> 00:13:53.400
a fatal attraction situation answers that at the end of the day are not at all

254
00:13:53.401 --> 00:13:54.420
convincing. Isn't it.

255
00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.250
<v 2>Hearing this argument for like many years from political Skyah to lift the</v>

256
00:13:59.251 --> 00:14:02.490
Namco, to scrape all that. It could not possibly be the Kremlin,

257
00:14:02.491 --> 00:14:04.140
but someone trying to please the Kremlin.

258
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:06.690
But the problem with this argument is that in 2020,

259
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.410
the situation is not what it was in 2004, 2006.

260
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.520
It's really difficult to imagine that somebody would dare do something that

261
00:14:14.521 --> 00:14:19.410
drastic and not first secure some kind of agreement to be sure that he or she

262
00:14:19.411 --> 00:14:23.640
is on the safe side, Andre Soldatov expert on the Russian security.

263
00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.790
<v 1>It makes perfect sense. Doesn't it? But, okay.</v>

264
00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:29.910
I'm sure many of you are also asking yourselves, okay, Josh,

265
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.050
but what about the people?

266
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.570
What do the regular Russian citizens think about all this?

267
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:38.490
Well,

268
00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.820
that question is also somewhat difficult to answer because the truth is that

269
00:14:41.821 --> 00:14:44.820
Russian society, if it has learned anything over the last century,

270
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:48.090
is that when it comes to matters of power, it's better to keep your ears,

271
00:14:48.091 --> 00:14:50.790
eyes and mouth shut. Nevertheless, in spite of this,

272
00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:55.730
the opposition reap good results in the regional elections on 13 for September,

273
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:56.630
2020, Navani's allies,

274
00:14:56.631 --> 00:15:00.650
one regional representatives for the first time in history and made United

275
00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:05.570
Russia Putin's party lose the majority in two Siberian cities and

276
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:07.430
Marvis a bit. But in any case,

277
00:15:07.431 --> 00:15:10.730
the truth is that to express yourself actively is not only something extremely

278
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:14.090
dangerous for Russians in terms of repression and political consequences.

279
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.190
It is also difficult for them to find protection.

280
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.370
The information blackout in this respect is practically total.

281
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.760
So you see the consequences of going off script are pretty much those you have

282
00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:25.640
seen in this video. So from all of the visual politic team,

283
00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:29.900
our thoughts and our respect goes to all those people that have lost their lives

284
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:33.770
or have risked their lives fighting for a freer and more democratic Russia.

285
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.970
But at this point,

286
00:15:34.971 --> 00:15:38.780
how do you think the international community should act against the poisoning of

287
00:15:38.781 --> 00:15:42.170
the Russian opposition should Russian operations to kill opponents abroad,

288
00:15:42.171 --> 00:15:45.470
to be considered a violation of sovereignty against the foreign nation.
