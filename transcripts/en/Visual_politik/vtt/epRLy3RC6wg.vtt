00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.493
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.090
<v 1>If I asked you to name the biggest company in Latin America,</v>

3
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.390
in terms of market value, many of you think of giants like Petrobras,

4
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.640
the Brazilian oil company, or America Movil,

5
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.090
the multinational telecommunications company founded by Carlos slip.

6
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.920
You may even think of banks like Brazil's,

7
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.970
it's how or mining corporations like the Brazilian Bali or the Chilean called

8
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.223
Belco

9
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.750
Unless you follow the latter market very closely, or you live there,

10
00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:36.080
of course you will most likely be surprised to hear that it's an e-commerce

11
00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:39.950
company that is making the run for first place. And if that didn't surprise you,

12
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.030
the more stunning news is that the company in question is also Argentinian,

13
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.130
especially when we see headlines like that.

14
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.500
<v 2>Argentina's economic wounds send companies, fleeing investors, fear,</v>

15
00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:55.220
leftist governments, interventionists moves to stabilize, struggling economy.

16
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.120
The financial Titans.

17
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.350
<v 1>I'm referring to is Mercado Libra, uh,</v>

18
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.950
giants that is listed on the NASDAQ along with other stock exchanges.

19
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.140
And that at the time of preparing this video,

20
00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:08.570
the market value is that just over 50 billion,

21
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.110
Something like the Latin American Amazon, although in reality,

22
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.700
Mercado Libra is much more like Alibaba because unlike the North American giant,

23
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.870
this South American Titan that already operates in 18 countries in the region,

24
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.040
rarely trades in itself.

25
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.293
<v 0>Nice.</v>

26
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.760
<v 1>It works as a kind of marketplace that makes available to buyers and sellers,</v>

27
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.300
all the services they need in exchange for a small commission for each

28
00:01:35.301 --> 00:01:38.750
transaction and service provided buying and selling logistics,

29
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.760
financial operations, et cetera, et cetera.

30
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.110
The fact is that with more than 44 million buyers and 11 million sellers,

31
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.220
this is by far the largest e-commerce platform in all of Latin America.

32
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.940
It's been a huge commercial success,

33
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.690
which as you can imagine has also become a huge financial success.

34
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.350
Mercado Libra shares have been one of the best investments of the last.

35
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.513
<v 0>Okay.</v>

36
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.510
<v 1>Illustrate that point. If in 2010,</v>

37
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.570
you had invested $10,000 in shares in this company.

38
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.980
Those same shares would be worth almost $160,000 today.

39
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.440
That's if that you haven't sold them along the way, of course,

40
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.820
and appreciation that is six times higher than the one registered by the S and P

41
00:02:19.821 --> 00:02:22.820
500 total return that is even including dividends.

42
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.800
This has made us here at visual politic in collaboration with value school,

43
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.680
ask a few questions. What is behind such an increase?

44
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.900
What business model does Macondo Libra have?

45
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.830
What are its main strengths and weaknesses? What does the market make of it?

46
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.980
Well, as always in this video, we're going to answer all these questions,

47
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.330
but first you have to get to know the business model of the biggest Argentinian

48
00:02:53.331 --> 00:02:54.710
company of all time.

49
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.970
<v 2>Much more than online shopping.</v>

50
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.560
<v 1>God. A Libra was not a company founded in a garage far from it.</v>

51
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.480
It's co-founder and president Marcos Schell Perrin was studying for a MBA at

52
00:03:09.481 --> 00:03:13.560
Stanford university in 1999. When he mapped out this potential business.

53
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.750
<v 0>At.</v>

54
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.440
<v 1>That time micro-scale Perrin decided study and worked in the financial</v>

55
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.910
department of the Argentinian oil company YPF but when Repsol took control of

56
00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:27.450
that company, he found himself unemployed. It created a kind of now more,

57
00:03:27.451 --> 00:03:28.620
never situation for him.

58
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.800
So Galperin calls on his contacts to move his project forward.

59
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.030
Even from very early on,

60
00:03:33.031 --> 00:03:37.230
it obtained the support of significant investors and entities as prominent as JP

61
00:03:37.231 --> 00:03:41.430
Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Banco Santander in October, 2001,

62
00:03:41.431 --> 00:03:45.240
just two years after it's launched McCarter Libra signed a partnership agreement

63
00:03:45.241 --> 00:03:49.620
with E-bay whereby the American company became its largest shareholder a status

64
00:03:49.621 --> 00:03:51.330
they maintained until 2016.

65
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.150
But the fact is that since its expansion began, it has been unstoppable.

66
00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.980
And what began as an e-commerce space,

67
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.820
that is a simple space for buying and selling has become a whole commercial

68
00:04:02.821 --> 00:04:05.130
ecosystem present in 18 different kinds.

69
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.270
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

70
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.600
<v 1>This company currently operates with the following six divisions,</v>

71
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.380
first Mercado Libra, which is strictly speaking the e-commerce market.

72
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.380
<v 0>Then.</v>

73
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.580
<v 1>There is Mercado Pago,</v>

74
00:04:20.581 --> 00:04:23.820
the FinTech service division that deals with digital payment methods.

75
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.960
It's roughly equivalent to what ant financial with its Alli pay system is to

76
00:04:27.961 --> 00:04:29.250
Alibaba and take note,

77
00:04:29.251 --> 00:04:32.700
because as we will see later on this division already accounts for most of the

78
00:04:32.701 --> 00:04:33.534
company's revenue,

79
00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.050
and it has even begun to deliver products such as investment funds to its

80
00:04:37.051 --> 00:04:37.884
clients.

81
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.553
<v 0>In third place.</v>

82
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.100
<v 1>We find Mikado envious, which is in charge of logistics. Yeah.</v>

83
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.610
Mikado shops, which is the Latin American Shopify.

84
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.390
That is to say it offers software and templates to be able to create and manage

85
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.350
online stores.

86
00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.690
<v 0>In.</v>

87
00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.520
<v 1>Fifth place, Mercado Libra, publicity,</v>

88
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.100
that which manages the online advertising within the planet.

89
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.820
<v 0>Form itself, and finally.</v>

90
00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.230
<v 1>McCarter credit over a purely financial arm dedicated to providing cash advances</v>

91
00:05:10.231 --> 00:05:11.100
and small loans. Yeah.

92
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.993
<v 0>Sellers and buyers.</v>

93
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.870
<v 1>As you can see, just with Alibaba,</v>

94
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.620
this company has gradually extended its activity to new markets. Well,

95
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.040
the fact is that with all these lines of business Mercado Libra achieved a

96
00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:27.060
turnover of almost $2.3 billion in 2019.

97
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.200
I figured that in 2020 could exceed 3.5 billion.

98
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.890
Now wait a minute.

99
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.420
How can a company that had the turnover of just over 2 billion in 2019 and lost

100
00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:42.960
almost $200 billion be valued at over 50 billion?

101
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.930
What does the market see in this company? Well, let's take a look.

102
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.260
<v 0>The dream of Eldorado,</v>

103
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.680
let's do that.

104
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.550
<v 1>Between Tierra Del Fuego at the Southern most tip of South America and the</v>

105
00:05:56.551 --> 00:06:00.200
border with the lifts, some 655 million people,

106
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.500
almost twice the population of the United States with an average per capita

107
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:04.540
income, similar to that.

108
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.823
<v 0>China.</v>

109
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.200
<v 1>However, despite this in the Latin American and Caribbean region,</v>

110
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.820
e-commerce spending represented only 4.4% of all retail sales in

111
00:06:15.821 --> 00:06:17.380
2019, by comparison,

112
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.300
this figure was almost 11% in the United States and more than 20% in China for

113
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.660
the same.

114
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.920
<v 0>Period, we would have to.</v>

115
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.390
<v 1>At least a decade in North American data to find similar figures to those that</v>

116
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.390
Latin America has today in terms of e-commerce. However,

117
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:37.780
what this low figure presents is an opportunity for the future,

118
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.770
an opportunity that could drive the growth of the Macado Libra business for many

119
00:06:41.771 --> 00:06:42.430
years to come.

120
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.700
And do you know what that has been precisely what's been happening recently

121
00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:46.810
during the last few years,

122
00:06:46.811 --> 00:06:49.900
the growth of e-commerce in Latin America has been very similar to that

123
00:06:49.901 --> 00:06:51.070
registered in the rest of the.

124
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.470
<v 0>Well.</v>

125
00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.160
<v 1>The fact is that today the company featured in this video is by far the leader</v>

126
00:07:00.161 --> 00:07:03.610
in all major markets in the region, Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile,

127
00:07:03.611 --> 00:07:04.270
and Colombia.

128
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.800
So it seems to be in an unbeatable position to take advantage of the upsurge in

129
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.890
e-commerce that this region is experiencing. And just remember,

130
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.090
we are talking about a market of just over $80 billion in 2020,

131
00:07:16.091 --> 00:07:18.880
that is expected to grow by 50% in the next three years.

132
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:19.803
<v 0>He is alone.</v>

133
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.141
<v 1>This point,</v>

134
00:07:23.141 --> 00:07:26.770
we need to discuss an important issue that those of you who follow visual

135
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.390
politics know all too well,

136
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.380
Latin America is a difficult region to do business in only two of its largest

137
00:07:32.381 --> 00:07:35.770
economies, Brazil, and Argentina even rank in the world,

138
00:07:35.771 --> 00:07:39.460
banks doing business index or ranking that attempts to rank countries,

139
00:07:39.461 --> 00:07:41.770
according to how easy it is to do business there,

140
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.750
their rankings are 124 and 126 respectively proof that in this

141
00:07:46.751 --> 00:07:49.780
index, Latin America usually rates badly year after year.

142
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.860
And not only that trade in the region has some very unusual characteristics.

143
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.730
Barriers to international trade are high. Bureaucracy is suffocating.

144
00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.740
The vast majority of companies are small.

145
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.460
And the proportion of transactions in the economy that occur outside of banks is

146
00:08:03.461 --> 00:08:04.480
overwhelming. Well,

147
00:08:04.481 --> 00:08:08.590
it is precisely in this environment that Mercado Libra has specialized at that.

148
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.500
That is something that could give it a certain competitive advantage.

149
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.590
Their knowledge of the local market may be more difficult to replicate then

150
00:08:14.591 --> 00:08:16.540
simply copying models from other regions.

151
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.290
<v 0>Well, in other words.</v>

152
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.140
<v 1>If there's one thing that makes this company stand apart,</v>

153
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:27.880
it is precisely its ability to read and adapt to the regional reality, but okay.

154
00:08:27.881 --> 00:08:31.540
Okay. This is easy to say, and it could just sound like a bunch of hot air.

155
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:33.670
So do you want a concrete example? Well.

156
00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.630
<v 0>Check this out. Latin America.</v>

157
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.900
<v 1>Okay. Is a region with many, many peculiarities, for example,</v>

158
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:45.400
although it may be hard to believe according to existing research today in 2020,

159
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.420
more than 50% of the population does not even have a bank account.

160
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.590
And depending on the country,

161
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:55.620
the use of credit card or debit cards is only common amongst 20% to 55 of the

162
00:08:55.621 --> 00:08:56.280
population.

163
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.300
And of course it goes without saying that this can be a huge problem when you're

164
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:04.230
trading online. If consumers don't have a bank account or use cards,

165
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.610
how on earth are they gonna.

166
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:06.763
<v 0>Hey, you.</v>

167
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:13.160
<v 1>That is precisely why in 2004, five years after the company was founded,</v>

168
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:17.180
Mercado Libra created Mercado, PayGo, its own payment platform.

169
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.310
Something like what Ali is in China,

170
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:23.450
a platform adapted to the local reality that even facilitates cash payments

171
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.710
using local locations,

172
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:28.010
such as convenience stores and take note because this division of their business

173
00:09:28.011 --> 00:09:29.990
was not only a winner for the commercial division,

174
00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.000
but since the second quarter of 2020,

175
00:09:32.001 --> 00:09:35.420
it has contributed most of the revenue of the entire company.

176
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.290
Mercado PayGo is no longer only in charge of managing payments on the Mercado

177
00:09:39.291 --> 00:09:40.700
Libra platform itself,

178
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.810
but has made the leap to the outside world where its growth is by the way,

179
00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:46.070
even more phenomenal.

180
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.420
Their off-platform business has grown at an annual rate of 75%.

181
00:09:50.421 --> 00:09:51.860
Over the past five years.

182
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:52.993
<v 0>Take a look.</v>

183
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:57.950
<v 1>During 2019,</v>

184
00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:01.820
this division facilitated more than $28 billion in payments.

185
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.030
I figured that in 2020 could increase to around $40 billion.

186
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.750
And although Latin America continues to be the region of the world where cash is

187
00:10:08.751 --> 00:10:12.260
King, the trend that is happening in the rest of the world is clear.

188
00:10:12.261 --> 00:10:14.510
Cash is losing favor to the rest of the options,

189
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.370
which are becoming more and more extensive.

190
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.080
<v 2>They have an incredible opportunity to become the company of prepayments and</v>

191
00:10:21.081 --> 00:10:23.090
Latin America. So dark Sean Murphy,

192
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.270
senior analyst and fund manager at GQ G partners.

193
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.770
<v 1>This is what explains why in March,</v>

194
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:35.750
2019 PayPal announced an Alliance with an investment of $750 million in the

195
00:10:35.751 --> 00:10:39.140
Argentinian company and pay attention because in 2020,

196
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.740
this company has found even more unexpected wind in its sails.

197
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.833
<v 0>Coronavirus.</v>

198
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:47.450
<v 1>Yes, yes, that's right.</v>

199
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:51.290
McCarter Libra has been one of those companies that has benefited the most from

200
00:10:51.291 --> 00:10:52.220
the pandemic. Why?

201
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.970
Because social distancing measures and fear of contagion have propelled its two

202
00:10:55.971 --> 00:10:59.180
main business divisions like a rocket on the physical level, quarantine,

203
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.020
confinements,

204
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:04.040
and other social distancing measures have driven the transition to E commerce.

205
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:04.761
And on the other hand,

206
00:11:04.761 --> 00:11:08.300
fears of contagion have accelerated through decline of handling cash.

207
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.990
<v 2>Thanks to COVID consumers don't want to touch anything.</v>

208
00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.470
And that is creating a virtuous circle for us. Michael Maybeck,

209
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.750
president and CEO of MasterCard.

210
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:24.650
The pandemic generated significant changes in consumer behavior resulting in a

211
00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:28.430
new milestone and the penetration of e-commerce and online payments in the

212
00:11:28.431 --> 00:11:31.730
region. Pedro Arndt, chief financial officer, Mercado, Libra.

213
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.030
<v 1>And all this is something that naturally has been reflected in the Mercado.</v>

214
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:42.320
Libra is accounts. The second quarter of 2020 was simply a month of new records.

215
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:45.530
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

216
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.210
<v 1>I'll give you an idea during this period,</v>

217
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.050
the sales facilitated by Macado Libra grew 102%.

218
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.790
And the total value of the payments managed was hundred and 42% higher.

219
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.570
This is what explains why the stock price has had such positive growth

220
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:03.280
throughout 2020. Now hold on a moment because not everything is so rosy. Yes,

221
00:12:03.281 --> 00:12:07.180
the company is growing at a dizzying speed of that. There can be no doubt.

222
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:11.110
For example, look out to this graph that shows how income has evolved since 26.

223
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.440
<v 0>How about the, this graph must be viewed in tandem with this one.</v>

224
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:30.180
<v 1>As revenues have increased, the operating margin has continued to worsen. Why?</v>

225
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.090
Well, it's quite simple, firstly, because in many cases,

226
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.540
mainly because it's the cost of shipments, the company sells at a loss.

227
00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:37.440
And secondly,

228
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.550
because the company is spending a lot of money on marketing and on expanding its

229
00:12:41.551 --> 00:12:42.384
capacity.

230
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:45.780
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

231
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:46.440
<v 1>In other words,</v>

232
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.250
Mercado Libra is following the trends of the new Silicon Valley and wall street

233
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.610
where growth comes first and profits don't matter so much. On the other hand,

234
00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:57.420
it should be noted that the company shares are not exactly cheap. For example,

235
00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:01.320
at the time of making this video, McArdle Libra was trading at almost 15 times,

236
00:13:01.321 --> 00:13:05.580
the value of all its revenue forecast for 2020 while companies like Amazon or

237
00:13:05.581 --> 00:13:09.930
Alibaba are trading at four and seven times, those values respectively. And if,

238
00:13:09.931 --> 00:13:13.650
instead of looking at the revenue, we look at the bitter, which as you know,

239
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.860
is the gross operating profit before interest taxes,

240
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.780
depreciation and amortization.

241
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:22.500
Then this company is trading at a whopping 252 times.

242
00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.630
It's a bit D 252 times.

243
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.760
It seems to believe that this company is going to grow like crazy over the next

244
00:13:32.761 --> 00:13:36.870
few years until it becomes the new Alibaba or the new Amazon. The question is,

245
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.800
will it make it,

246
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:42.120
will it be able to meet its goals in a region as complicated as Latin America?

247
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.871
Does it make sense?

248
00:13:42.871 --> 00:13:47.040
There's a company that loses money and has a turnover of just over $3 billion is

249
00:13:47.041 --> 00:13:51.450
valued at over $50 billion. We don't know. Only time will tell. However,

250
00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:54.210
if one thing has become clear over the last few years,

251
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:58.350
it is that this type of company is an incredible business, but at this point,

252
00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.960
it's your turn. What do you think of Mercado Libra?

253
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.360
Do you think it could be a good investment opportunity?

254
00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:07.590
Will it have to face new competitors as just in LeBron's Invesco's emerging

255
00:14:07.591 --> 00:14:09.450
markets, investment manager suggests.

256
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.710
<v 2>Mercado. Libra has no chance of winning the business of Mexico.</v>

257
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:16.800
Amazon is free to operate there because of the free trade agreement.

258
00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:20.070
And Walmart has a large presence through wall mix, Justin Levine.
