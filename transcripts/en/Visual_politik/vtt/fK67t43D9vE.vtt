00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.820
<v 0>Hi, my name is grant I'm bald, I'm British. And most importantly,</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.940
I don't have a beard because I'm not Simon just before we get into this video.

3
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:07.950
Let me thank today's sponsor. Skillshare.

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.800
Skillshare is an online learning community for creators,

5
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.170
with thousands of classes in design business, and.

6
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.510
<v 1>More. We've.</v>

7
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.330
<v 0>Talked about Skillshare a few times on this channel and mentioned the various</v>

8
00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:20.550
courses and things you can learn on that platform,

9
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.470
but maybe you haven't got Skillshare yet,

10
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.540
and you are totally skill less like me.

11
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.420
That's a shame because there are thousands of classes on Skillshare for you to

12
00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:30.930
level up your design business, video, social media, whatever skills,

13
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.110
or just take from them. Nothing. You can do that too.

14
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.690
Here in visual politic, we've taken to video production courses, camera courses,

15
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.240
YouTube type stuff for making the channel better.

16
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.730
We also want to squeeze out as much as possible from our date.

17
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.100
So we watched this course by a guy called Thomas Frank,

18
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.860
who is also a YouTuber on getting more stuff done in a day.

19
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.580
Great stuff is worth Jack and I, if you want more done out of your 24 hours,

20
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.060
but yes, Skillshare just go do it. You'll like it.

21
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.650
It's also free for two months,

22
00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:01.140
so you can try it out and I'm pretty sure you'll continue your membership

23
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.820
because it is fantastic.

24
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.730
You can also support visual politics by supporting Skillshare.

25
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.850
There's a link below which will let you use the platform for two months for

26
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:11.820
free, as I already mentioned, but you guys know that I'm Scottish.

27
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.580
We love free stuff. So let's get into the video

28
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.920
Again. And what is almost an endless story? Korea is on fire.

29
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.980
It almost seemed that peace negotiations between North Korea,

30
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.870
South Korea and the United States.

31
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.840
We're on the right track yet far from claiming victory.

32
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.100
Things may have become complicated yet again. So my visual politic geeks,

33
00:01:46.101 --> 00:01:49.280
the peace talks that have taken place in recent years have resulted in the

34
00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:53.720
longest period of stability on the Korean peninsula and the last 20 years,

35
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.860
not since the days of the sunshine policy promoted by president Kim de Jong,

36
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.600
has there been as much positive news?

37
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.790
All this is thanks to this man.

38
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.720
The current president of South Korea Mingy and has made the approach to polling

39
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.990
young,

40
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.530
the main objective of his team in government or reaching out the ultimately

41
00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:15.620
seeks the signing of a peace agreement that would bring a final ends to the

42
00:02:15.621 --> 00:02:17.390
Korean war once. And for all,

43
00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:20.900
because let's not forget this war has technically been ongoing since

44
00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:24.890
1953. It's only buffered by a simple armistice,

45
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.800
much like the arguments between me and any girlfriend I've ever had.

46
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:30.410
<v 1>The hold on a woman.</v>

47
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.100
<v 0>Because just no less than two years before he finishes his term and against all</v>

48
00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:35.270
the odds Mungy ends.

49
00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:38.900
Dream of such political success may have been definitively crippled.

50
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.230
And the obvious question is what exactly happened to make those peace talks

51
00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:46.190
suddenly blow up. Will moon have enough time to reroute dialogue towards peace?

52
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.090
What role does the United States Trump and the November election in the U S play

53
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.750
in all this mess and perhaps the most important question of all,

54
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.650
will we be witnessing the rise of a new leadership in North Korea and this

55
00:02:57.651 --> 00:03:00.250
video, we will tell you all about it. So.

56
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.173
<v 1>Listen up</v>

57
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.590
the metaphor of a controlled explosion.

58
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.590
Before we start take a look at these images.

59
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.123
What you've done.

60
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.211
<v 0>Seeing,</v>

61
00:03:21.211 --> 00:03:25.380
being blown to pieces is none other than the inter Korean liaison office,

62
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.500
a place that was established in September, 2018,

63
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.350
and that functioned in practice as a kind of embassy,

64
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.370
a place to meet and advanced negotiations between the two careers. However,

65
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.350
the communist regime decided on June 16 to 2020 to use a massive load

66
00:03:40.351 --> 00:03:44.220
of explosives to blow this building to kingdom, come an explosion.

67
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.810
This symbolizes just how they do things and how they understand negotiations in

68
00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:52.530
Pyongyang. This was the latest, bold move by the North Korean regime,

69
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.610
a move that began with the unilateral cutting of the telephone lane used by both

70
00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:59.850
countries to speak and coordinate military and civilian matters.

71
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.010
<v 1>North Korea cuts off all communication lines to South Korea, the New York times.</v>

72
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.780
<v 0>What it was the liaison offices explosion that felt like a real slap in the face</v>

73
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.100
to [inaudible] government.

74
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.660
Basically it serves as a vivid depiction of how North Korea has blasted those

75
00:04:18.661 --> 00:04:21.720
peace talks that had been underway for more than two years,

76
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.650
our turning point and a story and a Southern romance that to tell the truth was

77
00:04:25.651 --> 00:04:27.450
a story that pong yang never quite.

78
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.380
<v 1>And look.</v>

79
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.570
<v 0>Because this exclusion does not bear his signature.</v>

80
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.480
It was not directly ordered by Kim Jong as is typical.

81
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.830
And as we might logically think, but by his little sister, Kim, you, John,

82
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.250
who we covered in a recent video about North Korea as possible political ears,

83
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.220
I'll leave that link to the video and the description. Hang on a minute.

84
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.550
His sister ordered the communication links to South Korea to be destroyed.

85
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.020
Something strange is going on.

86
00:04:52.021 --> 00:04:54.030
Don't you think that is unless you have a little sister,

87
00:04:54.031 --> 00:04:56.400
in which case you understand how destructive that can be.

88
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.480
We'll get into that in a moment though.

89
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.660
But first we have to take a look at what on earth has caused North Korea to

90
00:05:00.661 --> 00:05:03.540
destroy all of the progress made over the last two.

91
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:05.003
<v 1>Years.</v>

92
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.590
<v 0>What it all amounts to some helium balloons.</v>

93
00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.640
This whole mess has been caused by some helium balloons. Seriously,

94
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.510
we are talking about helium balloons, but they're balloons loaded with leaflets,

95
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.060
CDs, pen drives, dollar bills, radios,

96
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.570
and hundreds of other objects that help North Koreans get informed about what's

97
00:05:24.571 --> 00:05:26.910
going on outside of the so-called hermit kingdom.

98
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.930
They're released 11 times a year by a group of North Korean defectors known as

99
00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:32.910
the fighters for a free North Korea.

100
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.420
A group of activists led by the notorious disaster park sang hack.

101
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.500
The main objective of these actions is for the former fellow citizens to know

102
00:05:40.501 --> 00:05:43.020
the reality of what is happening abroad and in this way,

103
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.000
a rod confidence in the Northern regime. Well, the last release was May 31st,

104
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.710
2020, and the next was scheduled for June.

105
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.040
And it was precisely this launched the unleashed North Korea's wrath.

106
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.130
<v 1>But wait, just one moment. Why would something that takes.</v>

107
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.420
<v 0>Place 11 times a year for several years suddenly now under the communist regime</v>

108
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:06.580
so much? Well,

109
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.770
right there is where the crux of the matter is.

110
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.080
Let's just say that theoretically,

111
00:06:11.081 --> 00:06:14.710
it doesn't make much sense to derail all of the earlier advances and an issue

112
00:06:14.711 --> 00:06:16.390
that after all it's not new,

113
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.510
what's more as a response to something that is not even the fault of the South

114
00:06:19.511 --> 00:06:20.321
Korean government,

115
00:06:20.321 --> 00:06:24.100
but the work of groups of defectors who do this by exercising their freedom of

116
00:06:24.101 --> 00:06:24.880
speech.

117
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.140
But if we were also to tell you that the South Korean government itself sided

118
00:06:29.141 --> 00:06:32.710
with North Korea, then this whole thing makes even less sense.

119
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:33.880
Take a look at this.

120
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.100
<v 2>South Korea says mulling leaflet ban after Kim's sister threat France</v>

121
00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:43.390
24, and he act that she could pose a threat to the life and property of the

122
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.910
residents in the border area should be stopped,

123
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.800
said unification ministry spokesman, yo song ki youngie orders,

124
00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:54.910
entry ban in border areas to block anti North leaflets.

125
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.930
The Korea Harold violators will be arrested on the scene and face imprisonment

126
00:06:58.931 --> 00:07:01.390
of up to one year or a fine of 10 million,

127
00:07:01.391 --> 00:07:05.830
one equivalent to 8,300 United States dollars under the framework act on the

128
00:07:05.831 --> 00:07:07.630
management of disasters and safety.

129
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.360
<v 0>So after years and years of being released now,</v>

130
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.500
suddenly the South Korean authorities think this whole balloon thing is a clear

131
00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:18.280
threat to life and property. Something that as you can probably imagine,

132
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.940
has not gone on noticed for many analysts and experts.

133
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.840
This decision violates the political freedom and freedom of expression of this

134
00:07:25.841 --> 00:07:27.730
group of North Korean activists.

135
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:38.320
However, despite this,

136
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.620
the decision of the South Korean authorities was made after receiving these

137
00:07:41.621 --> 00:07:45.220
threats from Kim Jong herself, the sister of the great leader.

138
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.900
<v 2>Clearly speaking,</v>

139
00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.050
the South Korean authorities will be forced to pay a dear price.

140
00:07:50.051 --> 00:07:54.010
If they let the situation go on while making these sorts of excuses,

141
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.790
if they fail to take the corresponding steps for the senseless act against their

142
00:07:57.791 --> 00:07:58.780
fellow countrymen,

143
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:02.650
they had better get themselves ready for the possibility of a complete withdraw

144
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.410
of the already desolate case song, industrial park,

145
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.140
following the stop to tours of Mt. Coombe gong,

146
00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.230
or shut down of the North South joint liaison office,

147
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:15.490
whose existence only as to trouble of the scrapping of the North South agreement

148
00:08:15.491 --> 00:08:19.900
in the military field, which is hardly of any value. Kim [inaudible] Kim Jong.

149
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:21.250
<v 0>Of course,</v>

150
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.880
the rhetoric of insults and threats to the little sister Kim Joan carried out

151
00:08:24.881 --> 00:08:27.760
for days was not only aimed at the South Korean government,

152
00:08:27.761 --> 00:08:30.040
but also at the defectors themselves,

153
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.980
who they called more than just a few names, which again,

154
00:08:32.981 --> 00:08:35.440
anyone with a little sister will recognize, check it out.

155
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.180
<v 2>The human scum,</v>

156
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:41.920
little short of wild animals who betrayed their own Homeland are engrossed in

157
00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:43.540
such unbecoming acts.

158
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.440
They are sure to be called mongrel dogs as they bark in places where they should

159
00:08:47.441 --> 00:08:48.730
not cameo jump.

160
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.630
<v 0>To be fair. If a North Korean leader tells you this, it's sort of a compliment.</v>

161
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.103
<v 1>The point is.</v>

162
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.070
<v 0>Whole thing has generated a lot of controversy. In any case,</v>

163
00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.280
what has happened is that moon's government has prioritized as relations with

164
00:09:04.281 --> 00:09:06.740
North Korea over political rights in the South.

165
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:09.800
That's a very controversial move. This is something to keep an eye on.

166
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:13.760
The background is more complex than it seems should a democratic government

167
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:17.750
limit as citizens rights or capacities to act in order to improve its relations

168
00:09:17.751 --> 00:09:20.300
with the [inaudible] regime. That's where I leave it up to you.

169
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:25.010
<v 2>We in South Korea have our own sovereignty. And in this democratic country,</v>

170
00:09:25.011 --> 00:09:29.120
people have three basic rights and one of them is freedom of speech.

171
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.840
If the leaflets get blocked, we will send drones. They cannot stop.

172
00:09:32.841 --> 00:09:35.060
Us fact in truth cannot be stopped.

173
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:39.860
The voice of 45,000 defectors who seek truth will continue

174
00:09:39.861 --> 00:09:44.330
park song, Huck, defector, and leader of the fighters for free North Korea.

175
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:48.290
<v 0>In any case, the worst thing is that in the end, all of this has been fun.</v>

176
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:49.243
<v 1>Nothing.</v>

177
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:52.940
<v 0>Let's get to the most important question.</v>

178
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.380
Why is Camille Jong making this play and why note let's take a look.

179
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.390
<v 2>The empowerment of the chosen one.</v>

180
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.420
<v 0>We talked in a recent video about what could happen in North Korea at Kim young</v>

181
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:12.830
earn date. And that case,

182
00:10:12.831 --> 00:10:16.640
the dictator sister cameo Jones would be in pole position to be the successor

183
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.400
and my visual politic nerds keep one thing in mind,

184
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:23.030
although rumors of young ans death turned out to be grossly exaggerated.

185
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:27.800
The fact that this dictator is still alive doesn't mean that he may not be very

186
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.560
ill. You kind of know who their schools already, the regime secrecy.

187
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.860
Doesn't let us know for sure what's going on or what the future Kim young and

188
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:34.370
faces.

189
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:38.390
But what we can do is did you see what's going on in the regime by analyzing how

190
00:10:38.391 --> 00:10:39.350
he's behaving?

191
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:43.580
And the truth is that this latest North Korean tantrum has been really very

192
00:10:43.581 --> 00:10:47.750
strange and bear in mind that we're talking about North Korea as strange due to

193
00:10:47.751 --> 00:10:50.960
the fact that the person chosen to shatter two years of peace talks.

194
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:52.580
Wasn't the Supreme leader, Kim young,

195
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.740
but his sister Kim Jong and these events can be read and several possible

196
00:10:57.741 --> 00:10:58.574
ways,

197
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:03.320
Hunt and diplomatic terms.

198
00:11:03.321 --> 00:11:07.130
The fact that it is Kim Jong and not Kim Jong-un who abruptly ends,

199
00:11:07.131 --> 00:11:09.680
the dialogue could be a way of belittling South Korea.

200
00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:13.340
That is to lower the level of importance that school apparently has for

201
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.640
Pyongyang after all you're Jong as an important figure and the regime,

202
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.800
but she is not the Supreme figure.

203
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:23.270
Therefore we could be looking at a cunning move to show that South Korea as not

204
00:11:23.271 --> 00:11:26.570
as important to them as North Korea as to moon's government.

205
00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:27.523
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

206
00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.100
<v 0>Okay. So this would be one possibility,</v>

207
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.310
but if you look at the implications that this has for the regime itself,

208
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.220
there is much more to it than meets the eye with this operation.

209
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:41.840
Kim Jong demonstrates or at least may have wanted to prove that she is a strong,

210
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.550
determined and unscrupulous woman,

211
00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.390
a person capable of carrying out hard setting actions without any qualms.

212
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.780
And this in order to present herself as number two in the regime,

213
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.880
or even as the possible successor as

214
00:11:58.410 --> 00:11:59.040
North Korea,

215
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.490
there has never been the possession of deputy leader or anything resembling it.

216
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.240
There has never been a number two in the circle of power and the dentisty yet.

217
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:10.260
That is precisely what seems to be being built around the figure of you John,

218
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:14.130
a second figure with decisive power and capable of operating with some

219
00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.390
independence. Kim Jong-un has not said a word throughout this entire episode.

220
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.360
And although he was surely the one who signed off on everything that has been

221
00:12:21.361 --> 00:12:24.000
done and the eyes of his people and of the world,

222
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.890
the visible face has been that.

223
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:27.143
<v 1>His sisters.</v>

224
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.360
<v 0>Tension, because that is not the end of it.</v>

225
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.660
Several South Korean experts on the subject, such as we assume luck,

226
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:40.530
a former South Korean ambassador to Russia consider what North Korea has done to

227
00:12:40.531 --> 00:12:42.420
actually be a very thoughtful maneuver.

228
00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:46.500
So it was not to have too much prominence. And the upcoming November, 2020 U.

229
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:47.730
<v 1>S election check out.</v>

230
00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.990
<v 2>Provocations like an ICBM test could backfire.</v>

231
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:55.770
So Kim must be thinking hard not to overplay his hand until November X

232
00:12:55.771 --> 00:12:56.640
ambassador wheat.

233
00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.010
<v 0>The question you're probably asking is why,</v>

234
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.850
because a major provocation for the United States could be a bit of a bonus for

235
00:13:02.851 --> 00:13:04.890
Joe Biden's foreign policy planning.

236
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.070
And we already know that Kim Jong UN and Donald Trump get along.

237
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:08.993
<v 1>Very well.</v>

238
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.180
<v 0>So think about it for just one moment,</v>

239
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.720
repressing the launch of Intercontinental ballistic missiles or returning to the

240
00:13:18.721 --> 00:13:23.250
path of nuclear testing are things that would be a direct threat to the United

241
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:23.280
States.

242
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.660
And obviously that could be used by Baden to attack Trump's policy towards

243
00:13:27.661 --> 00:13:31.860
North Korea and possibly even to argue that Trump is the cause of North Korea,

244
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.000
gaining strength,

245
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:35.940
and let's not forget the huge role that North Korea has played.

246
00:13:35.941 --> 00:13:38.100
And Donald Trump's foreign policy agenda.

247
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:39.923
<v 1>My friend.</v>

248
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.900
<v 3>I just wish him well. I've had a very good relationship with Kim Jong-un.</v>

249
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:49.050
If I weren't president you'd be in war, you would have been in war with Korea.

250
00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:51.930
You would have been in war with North Korea. I wasn't president that.

251
00:13:51.931 --> 00:13:56.910
I can tell you he expected that, that I can tell you. I hope he's fine.

252
00:13:58.980 --> 00:13:59.130
So.

253
00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:02.880
<v 0>This might be a good explanation for why North Korea has chosen to blow up the</v>

254
00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.940
inter Korean liaison office launch a few short range missiles,

255
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.650
or do things like this.

256
00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:11.850
<v 2>North Korea, reinstalling propaganda loudspeakers, the Korea times.</v>

257
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.920
<v 0>Although in typical North Korea fashion,</v>

258
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.920
as it turns out three days after putting up those loads speakers and without

259
00:14:16.921 --> 00:14:19.320
using them at all, most of those speakers disappeared.

260
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.630
You see,

261
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:28.740
these are strange maneuvers that seem designed to wind up and stress mainly

262
00:14:28.741 --> 00:14:32.070
South Korea and also possibly Japan, but importantly,

263
00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.500
not uncle Sam following that logic.

264
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:38.430
It could mean that North Korea does not want under any circumstances to break

265
00:14:38.431 --> 00:14:40.020
the negotiations with Washington,

266
00:14:40.021 --> 00:14:44.070
but instead they want to strengthen the great leaders sister. And by the way,

267
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.340
sticking your finger in the eye of the South Korean government for who knows

268
00:14:47.341 --> 00:14:51.180
what is something that has become almost a hobby from North Korean dictators.

269
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.280
But at this point,

270
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.790
it's up to you guys is Korea doomed to be debated forever and never reach a

271
00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:56.720
mutual understanding.

272
00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:00.440
What is North Korea really looking for by dynamiting peace stocks for the

273
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:01.520
umpteenth taint?

274
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:05.030
Is this all just a strategy to position Kim you're John at the top of the pale

275
00:15:05.031 --> 00:15:08.150
and the event, there is a change of leadership in the near future. So as always,
