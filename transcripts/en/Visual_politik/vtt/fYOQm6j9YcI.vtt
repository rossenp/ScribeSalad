<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.650
<v 1>The debacle and this Latin American country seems to be going on forever and a</v>

3
00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.420
day. And far from getting better.

4
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.590
This situation only seems to get worse and worse and worse,

5
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.600
Venezuela and GVP failed by our own 35% in 2019.

6
00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:33.740
And yes, I did say 35% and the last six years alone,

7
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.160
the country has lost two thirds of its wealth. In other words,

8
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.940
we are talking about a rapid decline that has virtually no historical precedent

9
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.570
and the world,

10
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.440
especially given that this is not a country that is technically at war and my

11
00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:47.990
friends, as we have already told you in previous videos,

12
00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:51.410
one of the great reasons for the shocking failure of the Bali vari and political

13
00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:55.040
and economic system has to do with its very high dependence on.

14
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.820
<v 0>Oil. Because.</v>

15
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.330
<v 1>For years, when crude oil was selling for more than $100,</v>

16
00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:06.230
a barrel Hugo Chavez on his accolades were able to indulge themselves in all

17
00:01:06.231 --> 00:01:09.920
kinds of wasteful spending. They scared away and punished private investment.

18
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.110
And despite this even went around with their heads,

19
00:01:12.111 --> 00:01:14.930
held high boosting of their great prosperity. However,

20
00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.700
since then things have changed a lot and have gotten much worse.

21
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.200
And now in 2020,

22
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.190
the coronavirus crisis has been the last straw for the Venezuelan oil industry

23
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.490
that as we will see has been treading water for years,

24
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.160
just take a look at this one fact viral event is wheeling oil sold for $9 and 90

25
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.220
cents in April, 2020.

26
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.450
And that's a long way down from the nearly $57 average pair viral in

27
00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:39.530
2019.

28
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.490
And let's look closer because this isn't even the worst of it.

29
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.850
Check out this chart that shows us how Venezuelan oil production has evolved

30
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.260
over the past 10 years.

31
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.750
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

32
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.900
<v 1>So you see my friends despite having the largest oil reserves in the world</v>

33
00:01:56.901 --> 00:02:00.020
today, the Boulevard and policy disaster has been a such magnitude.

34
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.460
The Venezuela today produces about six times less oil than it did just six years

35
00:02:04.461 --> 00:02:04.910
ago.

36
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.740
By 2020 crude oil revenues will be more than 95% less than they were just

37
00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:12.200
six years ago. And don't forget for a moment,

38
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.440
but we are talking about an economy that developed with basically a rentier

39
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:15.860
model,

40
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.640
the Boulevard and government never used the immense resources gained for the

41
00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:22.310
sale of oil to develop or diversify its economy.

42
00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:25.940
They didn't even invest in the very industry that was their golden goose.

43
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.290
It may be hard to believe,

44
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:31.040
but the truth is that oil production began to fall just when prices were.

45
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.533
<v 0>Soaring.</v>

46
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.470
<v 1>We are not only talking about oil extraction, but also it's refining.</v>

47
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.640
That is the process by which crude oil is transformed and diffuse in order to be

48
00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:46.580
used. And here the numbers are no better. In fact,

49
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.630
the truth is that they are much, much worse. Over the past two decades.

50
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.720
Venezuela's refinement capacity has only fallen further.

51
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.350
The lack of investment maintenance and the practice of replacing professionals

52
00:02:57.351 --> 00:02:59.800
with thousands of friends without competence.

53
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.250
Our training has caused Venezuelan refineries to have suffered a lot of

54
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:06.940
accidents, breakdowns and fires in recent years, I've gradually reduced.

55
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:09.760
Venezuela's refining capacity to basically zero.

56
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.680
In fact, 2020 began with news.

57
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.220
<v 2>PD, VSA shuts its last two operating refineries in Venezuela. Um,</v>

58
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.443
why Cardone?

59
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.160
<v 1>Right? You heard that correctly.</v>

60
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.610
One of the major players and the oil industry sector has been forced to close

61
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.210
its complexes. This includes the crown jewel, the Amway refinery,

62
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.020
the basis of what became one of the three largest all refining complexes on the

63
00:03:34.021 --> 00:03:34.650
planet.

64
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.340
I know don't think this is a move to fight climate change or anything positively

65
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.920
that fires breakdowns, electricity costs,

66
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.970
and even a lack of oil or what finally forced the Venezuelan government to shut

67
00:03:44.971 --> 00:03:45.360
down.

68
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.160
And that that's what explains why in a country that literally floats on oil.

69
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.470
We come across news stories like this one.

70
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.020
<v 2>Iranian petrol tanker arrives in Venezuela in defiance of us financial</v>

71
00:03:58.021 --> 00:03:58.854
times.

72
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.180
<v 1>Know what that is? What is the Boulevard and government going to do? Now,</v>

73
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.250
if it is no longer able to extract and refine the minimum quantity of oil that

74
00:04:07.251 --> 00:04:09.690
the Venezuelan economy needs in order to function,

75
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.940
how are they going to maintain their revolution now,

76
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
where are they going to get the resources they need to keep on breaking all the

77
00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:17.160
high ranking officers in the army and government.

78
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.880
So they remain loyal well it's right here where the last card from Nicolas

79
00:04:20.881 --> 00:04:22.920
Maduro is government comes into play

80
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.360
Because Wheeler has a region known as the Orinoco mining art that could count as

81
00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:33.540
one of the largest deposits of mineral riches in the world.

82
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.460
According to Venezuelan government data,

83
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.970
this region could hold 7,000 tons of gold, which by the way,

84
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.780
it would make it the second largest reserve in the world.

85
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.140
Millions of tons of kimberlite diamonds, iron bauxite,

86
00:04:46.141 --> 00:04:48.960
and another 40 high volume minerals, including Coulton,

87
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.230
which is currently one of the most prized minerals and the electronics industry.

88
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.730
If these figures are real,

89
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.810
which does not seem farfetched and Venezuela managed to exploit as potential on

90
00:04:57.811 --> 00:04:58.860
a regular basis,

91
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.610
the country could raise billions of dollars each year dollars that could,

92
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.160
of course also be used to revive the oil industry,

93
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.990
the procurious national electricity system,

94
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.790
improve water treatment and distribution,

95
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.810
or be used to fund plans to industrialize and develop the Venezuelan economy.

96
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.580
In other words, when the time comes,

97
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.480
the Orinoco mining arts could play a key role in Venezuela's recovery.

98
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.670
Hold on just one moment because we have stumbled upon one inconvenient truth.

99
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.870
And so what does it, well,

100
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.250
these mining regions are anything but quiet and peaceful areas for doing

101
00:05:32.251 --> 00:05:35.340
business. In fact, the pretty much the opposite. So my friends,

102
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.850
do you want to know more about this wild story? If so, I'll ask it correct.

103
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.870
<v 0>The gold rush.</v>

104
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.050
<v 1>If there's one thing that characterizes the Venezuelan government is that they</v>

105
00:05:52.051 --> 00:05:54.030
wipe everything out, everything,

106
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.000
absolutely anything that implies a potential source of wealth,

107
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.180
they steal it or expropriate.

108
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.333
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

109
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.030
<v 1>Mining sector was not going to be treated any differently.</v>

110
00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.410
What is the metal that the Vista government is most interested in today as

111
00:06:14.411 --> 00:06:15.640
Germany have you already guessed?

112
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.373
<v 0>Cool.</v>

113
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.710
<v 1>Only is gold scarce,</v>

114
00:06:20.711 --> 00:06:24.220
but it's one of the few minerals and practically the only one that has a high

115
00:06:24.221 --> 00:06:29.020
value as soon as it is extracted, that is even without being processed. In fact,

116
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.570
native gold, which is what unrefined gold is called,

117
00:06:31.571 --> 00:06:35.590
has so much value that is more sought after than a lollipop on the playground.

118
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:39.340
And that is precisely why the Venezuelan government back in Chavez Titan made

119
00:06:39.341 --> 00:06:43.120
the control of its production distribution unseal. One of its main objectives,

120
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.160
a target that led Chavez to expropriate.

121
00:06:45.161 --> 00:06:49.480
A lot of concessions held by private mining companies between 2008 and 2011,

122
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.330
especially Canadian ones. Something that by the way,

123
00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.660
caused the Venezuelan government to be convicted by an international arbitration

124
00:06:55.661 --> 00:06:57.160
tribunal. Of course incorrect us.

125
00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.130
That's almost like getting a purple heart or military merits metal,

126
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.600
or if you don't know anything about the military,

127
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.290
imagine someone turns up at the party at 2:00 AM with a whole bunch of new boos,

128
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.430
but you know, it's the fight against imperialism. So let me ask you a question.

129
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.430
What do you think was the result in terms of production? Well,

130
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.570
not surprisingly gold production plummeted by 80% in just three years.

131
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.990
Exactly what you might've expected Boulevard and government has the uncanny

132
00:07:19.991 --> 00:07:22.390
ability to destroy everything it touches,

133
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.000
but let's just take it a moment before we pass judgment because things have

134
00:07:25.001 --> 00:07:26.680
changed somewhat in recent years,

135
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.040
not least because the material government knows that gold is one of the last few

136
00:07:30.041 --> 00:07:32.260
cards that has to play in order to cling to power,

137
00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.350
or should I say continue to looting the country with MPS.

138
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.213
<v 0>Unity.</v>

139
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:39.340
<v 1>In recent years,</v>

140
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.010
the material government has signed agreements with new mining companies,

141
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.000
mainly Russian and Chinese ones. And in 2015 they approved decree

142
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.040
2,165 11, the reinstatement of private companies and the sector. However,

143
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.730
companies can only operate through a joint venture with the state and always on

144
00:07:54.731 --> 00:07:59.050
the condition that at least 55% of that company is under the control of the

145
00:07:59.051 --> 00:08:00.970
Venezuelan government. And this way,

146
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.390
the state wants to continue to control production whilst benefiting from the

147
00:08:04.391 --> 00:08:05.890
experience of mining companies,

148
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.620
at least those that are daring to enter such a risky venture.

149
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.080
What's more as recently as April, 2020,

150
00:08:11.081 --> 00:08:14.860
the exploitation of gold mines and river areas was legalized up until that

151
00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:15.160
point.

152
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.090
This was prohibitive actively because it implies very high environmental damage,

153
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.780
but Maduro,

154
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:24.670
he now wants no needs Gould by any means possible and as much as

155
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.713
possible.

156
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:29.710
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

157
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.330
<v 1>It might not sound sort of strange,</v>

158
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.150
but look closer because here there is a slight problem.

159
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.200
Most mineral holdings and particularly gold are illegal and in the hands of

160
00:08:38.201 --> 00:08:41.980
criminal groups and traffickers who, and many cases are not exactly lately.

161
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:43.323
<v 0>Perfect.</v>

162
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:51.610
<v 1>No, there are around 2000 mains of this tape operating and this is not</v>

163
00:08:51.611 --> 00:08:52.444
insignificant.

164
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.620
The illegal mining currently carried out by non-government groups represents a

165
00:08:55.621 --> 00:08:59.850
good chunk of the gold production in the country. If not the majority of it,

166
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.270
these mines controlled by criminal groups and cleanse I've turned to Bali of our

167
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:03.690
state,

168
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.840
which is where the Orinoco mining art is located and to our region that is now

169
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.650
practically out war groups, such as that belonging to John Valdez,

170
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:14.520
AKA El Toto have become one of the government's greatest enemies by succeeding

171
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:15.390
and bringing the army,

172
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.230
the ELN or the national liberation army and former FARC guerrillas to their

173
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:23.880
knees. Yeah, that's right. The E L N and the X-bar forces as well.

174
00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.300
These guerrilla groups that were once purely Colombian I've now become criminal

175
00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:30.840
gangs of Colombian Venezuelan traffickers with whom that Chavista government

176
00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.090
openly collaborates to give you an idea.

177
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.600
It is estimated to have all the proceeds from Alyssa activities obtained by the

178
00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:40.860
ELN. 60% comes from illegal mining in Venezuela, and yes,

179
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.030
also in Columbia.

180
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:45.240
And this is something we will get into in a few moments because the truth is,

181
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:48.360
is that there is a lot and I mean a lot going on here.

182
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:52.370
Well,

183
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:56.030
we're going to review how gold production works in Venezuela and what role the

184
00:09:56.031 --> 00:09:58.430
central bank plays in this whole story.

185
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.090
As we will see the Venezuelan law States that all gold production must be

186
00:10:02.091 --> 00:10:04.130
delivered to the central bank of Venezuela,

187
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.760
which manages the gold reserves and the exports of the extracted gold to be

188
00:10:07.761 --> 00:10:10.340
traded. In addition, in order to export this mineral,

189
00:10:10.341 --> 00:10:12.920
the operation needs to be approved by the national assembly,

190
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:13.860
a legal requirement.

191
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.270
The [inaudible] government has ignored since the Venezuelan parliament fell into

192
00:10:17.271 --> 00:10:19.340
the hands of the opposition. But by far,

193
00:10:19.341 --> 00:10:22.910
the biggest problem is that due to the gigantic smuggling and illegal mining

194
00:10:22.911 --> 00:10:26.600
networks that may take gold out of Venezuela, mainly through Brazil and Ghana,

195
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:30.230
it is estimated that only one out of every three or four tons extracted are

196
00:10:30.231 --> 00:10:32.060
delivered to the Venezuelan central bank.

197
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:36.170
So an effect the government has already lost control over most of the gold

198
00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:38.030
trades and of course of that income.

199
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:41.810
And that is why the Vista government of Nicolas Maduro has declared war on

200
00:10:41.811 --> 00:10:43.520
illegal mining. They don't want to end it,

201
00:10:43.521 --> 00:10:46.520
but essentially to restore their power and take over the activity.

202
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.130
Or in other words, the idea is not to solve the problem,

203
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.600
but to replace the key player.

204
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.770
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

205
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.980
<v 1>The ugliest part of the story appears maintaining States,</v>

206
00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:01.490
especially Boulevard States have descended into a kind of violent anarchy or

207
00:11:01.491 --> 00:11:04.670
government criminals and smuggling, criminals, Kelly, each other for control.

208
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:07.280
It's a terrible scenario that is causing Savage killings.

209
00:11:07.281 --> 00:11:10.220
Like the ones we were used to watching on television or in Hollywood films,

210
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.710
the victims of these killings are miners from both sides,

211
00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:16.700
collaborators carriers, and of course all kinds of mercenaries and ringleaders.

212
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.530
So do you want to come with us to this place,

213
00:11:18.531 --> 00:11:21.290
to find out more about what's going on and to see how the balance is shifting?

214
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.570
Of course you do. So let's get started.

215
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.093
<v 0>Cool.</v>

216
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:38.390
<v 1>The Venezuelan government on the ELN gorillas and ex FOC forces have generated a</v>

217
00:11:38.391 --> 00:11:42.590
curious criminal symbiosis to take back control of the Orinoco gold.

218
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.920
And if the presence of these criminal groups already casts a dark shadow.

219
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.760
Imagine if we add to the mix, a corrupt military, or more specifically,

220
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.100
very corrupt taught officers the military,

221
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.240
instead of working to ensure that gold and his profits improve the country's

222
00:11:55.241 --> 00:11:59.650
economic situation are dedicated to filling their own pockets and have no qualms

223
00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:03.820
about working and collaborating with criminal gangs. And it turns out surprise,

224
00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:06.100
surprise. That's exactly what's going on.

225
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.280
The methods the military uses to fill their pockets in this particular criminal

226
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:13.120
ecosystem are known to be similar to those used by the ELN gorillas and the ex

227
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:13.990
FARC forces.

228
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.950
They collect a kind of tool in the form of gold Colton diamonds or whatever is

229
00:12:17.951 --> 00:12:21.250
extracted something like an enchained tax on the illegal groups.

230
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:22.810
They extract the ore. And you know,

231
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.240
if you aren't willing to jump through the hoop, then say goodbye,

232
00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:29.110
because they're after you. And then full out war is just around the corner,

233
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:32.950
but pay attention here because don't think that these are the only players

234
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.930
Venezuela's state owned mining company.

235
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.830
Minerva is also fully implicated in all of this murky history.

236
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.260
You're talking about a company that is sanctioned by the United States for

237
00:12:46.261 --> 00:12:48.630
illegally enriching Maduro and the trivia stick gang.

238
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.770
It has gone from extracting gold itself to being a mere channel for illegal

239
00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:53.760
gold. These days.

240
00:12:53.761 --> 00:12:57.240
Most of the gold that McNevin brings to the central bank of Venezuela to sale or

241
00:12:57.241 --> 00:12:58.140
take out of the country,

242
00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.270
comes from the extractions made by criminal groups controlled by the.

243
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:02.813
<v 0>Government.</v>

244
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.660
<v 1>That is to say in Venezuela, the extraction of many minerals and above all else,</v>

245
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.500
gold, no longer depends on the government concessions or private companies,

246
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.090
but simply on illegal groups.

247
00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:18.330
This is what the Boulevard and revolution has convected Venezuela into,

248
00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.340
but let's not go off track.

249
00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.190
Let's get back to the goal that the Venezuelan government manages and those

250
00:13:23.191 --> 00:13:25.650
become its last great source of income.

251
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.520
The point is the Jew to international sanctions.

252
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:36.180
The options that the Venezuelan government have to export their gold have also

253
00:13:36.181 --> 00:13:39.720
been considerably reduced. For example, before the sanctions,

254
00:13:39.721 --> 00:13:43.590
much of the native gold was sent to Switzerland for refining before being sold

255
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.750
or deposited in the coffers of the central bank.

256
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.580
But now after the U S sanctions,

257
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:50.100
the Swiss have become suspicious of this activity. Uh,

258
00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:53.700
no longer accept gold from Venezuela and as history buffs might know,

259
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:57.450
it takes an awful lot for the Swiss to not accept gold.

260
00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.690
That is something that forced Venezuelan leaders to change their routes today.

261
00:14:00.691 --> 00:14:03.960
The gold that the Venezuelan government manages to export is sent to places like

262
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:07.380
Turkey, Dubai, or Uganda. No,

263
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.630
really you Gunda listen up.

264
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:14.520
<v 0>73 Tons of Venezuelan gold slew to Turkey, Dubai,</v>

265
00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:16.110
and Uganda insight crime.

266
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.720
<v 1>According to information from insight crane,</v>

267
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.600
it is believed that the Venezuelan gold could be leaving the country on

268
00:14:21.601 --> 00:14:23.640
scheduled flights of Turkish airlines,

269
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:27.780
the largest Turkish Isla and flying between Turkey and Venezuela flight started

270
00:14:27.781 --> 00:14:32.580
in 2016 with three weekly services and were extended to five just one

271
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:37.200
year later. Does that sound at all suspicious? So what happens next?

272
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:39.510
What happens once the goal arrives in Turkey?

273
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.020
Well,

274
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.740
it appears that many of the refined gold bars later end up well protected in

275
00:14:46.741 --> 00:14:47.250
Iran,

276
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:51.230
which is a loyal ally of the Venezuelan regime or their deposits to banks in

277
00:14:51.231 --> 00:14:53.450
Singapore. Many of these operations of course,

278
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:57.440
are framed as sales to companies over dubious reputation and serve either to

279
00:14:57.441 --> 00:15:00.230
fill their own pockets or to pay for the supplies and suppliers.

280
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:03.950
The Venezuelan government needs to stay in power. But as we said before,

281
00:15:03.951 --> 00:15:07.610
it's not only Turkey that is used. Uganda has become another priority.

282
00:15:07.611 --> 00:15:11.330
Destination Venezuelan gold is refined there by the African gold refinery,

283
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.080
a company owned by the Belgian company go it's gold, which is based in Dubai.

284
00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:19.120
<v 0>Turkey.</v>

285
00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.480
<v 1>Uganda, Dubai, what are racket by the way,</v>

286
00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:26.500
this Belgium company is suspected of being part of an international blood gold

287
00:15:26.501 --> 00:15:27.310
trafficking network.

288
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.700
What does the term you use for gold illegally extracted in war zones or for

289
00:15:30.701 --> 00:15:34.480
whose trade and controlled? There are arms disputes between criminal gangs.

290
00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:38.350
I mean, come on. Just what is going on in the Orinoco mining arch?

291
00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:47.020
The worst part is that all these million dollar transactions,

292
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:50.440
regular Venezuelans see virtually nothing because sadly,

293
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:53.530
most of the gold that leaves the country under the pretext of refining,

294
00:15:53.531 --> 00:15:57.310
it never returns or even enters the central bank event. As we look again,

295
00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.940
neither in the form of gold bars, nor in the form of cash deposits,

296
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.640
it just disappears. So where could it possibly go?

297
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.460
I'm pretty sure that you already know the answer to that though. Don't you,

298
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:07.210
what's more,

299
00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:10.870
don't forget that between two thirds and three quarters that is most of all the

300
00:16:10.871 --> 00:16:14.320
gold production in the country is not controlled by the government or at least

301
00:16:14.321 --> 00:16:16.600
not through legitimate channels set by the law.

302
00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:19.630
<v 0>So.</v>

303
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:20.350
<v 1>In a nutshell,</v>

304
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.500
the corruption of the Vista regime and the state's lack of control over the

305
00:16:23.501 --> 00:16:26.980
smugglers causes Venezuelans to lose hundreds of tons of gold, hundreds,

306
00:16:26.981 --> 00:16:30.970
and hundreds of billions of dollars are taken and mined with impunity from the

307
00:16:30.971 --> 00:16:33.580
country, unfortunately is not only impoverishing Venezuela,

308
00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:38.230
but is bathing the country and blood as well. And it's not just about the gold.

309
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:41.440
It's a very similar story with the diamonds or the Venezuelan Colton.

310
00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:43.570
And of course, let's not forget the governments,

311
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:45.940
other source of income drug trafficking,

312
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.190
but that's something we covered in this video.

313
00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.070
So my friends,

314
00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:54.730
the Boulevard revolution has turned Venezuela into a great mafia States to the

315
00:16:54.731 --> 00:16:55.600
point of that note,

316
00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:59.350
the Boulevard and government itself is on its knees because it is no longer able

317
00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:02.770
to control those criminal groups operating within its own country.

318
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.700
So now the question is,

319
00:17:03.701 --> 00:17:06.700
do you think that Venezuela will be able to take advantage of all these immense

320
00:17:06.701 --> 00:17:08.470
riches to finally get back on its feet?

321
00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:12.070
Is there any solution to institutionalized corruption and organized crime in the

322
00:17:12.071 --> 00:17:16.600
country? Could Venezuela have already reached the point of no return as always.

323
00:17:16.601 --> 00:17:19.330
We ask the questions and leave it up to you to leave your answers,

324
00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.400
