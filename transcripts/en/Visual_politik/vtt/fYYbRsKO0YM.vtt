00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.420
<v 0>This video is made possible by Nord VPN. If you're online,</v>

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.200
you really should be using a VPN. And that's where Nord VPN comes in.

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.480
<v 1>I know it's tempting.</v>

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.950
<v 0>Not to bother and hope for the best,</v>

5
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.220
but really those stories you've read about people having their data stolen do

6
00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:17.130
happen. And you don't want to make it easy for anyone to do that.

7
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.430
But using a VPN offers more than just security. For example,

8
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.360
Nord VPN lets you access any of its thousands of servers and different countries

9
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.300
all around the globe. So if you've had the end of your Netflix queue,

10
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.660
simply try changing the location of your server and get access to content

11
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:34.470
libraries that due to licensing agreements are only available in specific

12
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:36.330
geographic locations. For example,

13
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.450
most of European countries have strong licensing agreements restricting which

14
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:42.570
soccer matches can be viewed depending on the location of the viewer with Nord

15
00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:46.020
VPN, you can change your country without even moving from your sofa.

<v 1>Let's get cracking</v>

34
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.223
[inaudible].

35
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.400
<v 0>From Hong Kong to the Sino Indian border throughout the South China sea and up</v>

36
00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:06.650
to the Senkaku islands and the East China sea,

37
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.430
the Chinese giant has been proving itself to be a strict and insatiable

38
00:02:10.431 --> 00:02:14.090
superpower with its neighbors for months. Making it clear that from now on,

39
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.840
it wants to be the one pulling the strings of power entry and politics,

40
00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:22.070
and this region of the world in order to do so as not hesitated to antagonize

41
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.370
practically all of its neighbors. During the last two years alone,

42
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.930
China has had clashes with Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, South Korea,

43
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.820
Brunei, Japan, and Hong Kong, and all of this without counting the coronavirus,

44
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.540
the trade war with the United States or the diplomatic clash with Australia.

45
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.480
And of course, Taiwan has been no exception.

46
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.170
The relationship between the people's Republic of China and Taiwan is also going

47
00:02:45.171 --> 00:02:48.470
through one of its most tense periods in recent decades.

48
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.380
During the last few months, we have seen economic threats,

49
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.030
large-scale military maneuvers,

50
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.780
an active campaign of political pressure to exclude Taiwan from international

51
00:02:56.781 --> 00:03:01.750
institutions and also a recurrent violation of Taiwanese airspace and waters by

52
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:03.070
the people's liberation army,

53
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.700
which is the formal name of the armed forces of the people's Republic of China.

54
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.820
And all of this has brought some key questions to the table.

55
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.980
How can Taiwan be defended?

56
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.430
Would it be possible to protect the Island from a possible invasion of what is

57
00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:18.010
happening in Taiwan? You want to know more.

58
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:19.493
<v 1>Listen up.</v>

59
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.810
<v 2>It's a threat of the red dragon.</v>

60
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.570
<v 0>The communist party of China claims Taiwan full sovereignty over the small</v>

61
00:03:33.571 --> 00:03:36.720
prosperous and democratic country of 24 million inhabitants.

62
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.660
As we have told you on other occasions they have been doing so since the

63
00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:43.380
politics of this Island separated from those of mainland China in 1940,

64
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.970
Over the last few decades,

65
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.360
Beijing thought that the growing economic and social ties that have been forged

66
00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:54.780
since the Chinese economy opened up to the world would facilitate the future

67
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.870
peaceful integration of Taiwan under some special model.

68
00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.960
Like the one that has existed for years in Hong Kong,

69
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.220
following the doctrine of one country, two systems, however, freedom,

70
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.670
democracy and openness to the West have fueled the opposite sentiment today.

71
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.180
At least two thirds of Taiwanese people no longer identify themselves as

72
00:04:12.181 --> 00:04:14.940
Chinese, but simply as Taiwanese, likewise,

73
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.570
more than 60% of the population has a negative image of mainland China,

74
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.840
especially of course of its government and political system.

75
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.340
Taiwan is less and less Chinese possession certainly shared by president Tsai.

76
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.050
Ing-wen herself. Of course,

77
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.890
the bad news is that China has never given up what it considers to be legitimate

78
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.140
rate to reunify Taiwan with the mainland,

79
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.340
even if it means resorting to force G Zhang Peng have self has clearly defended

80
00:04:38.341 --> 00:04:42.150
by DIA and take note because the deadline they are considering in Beijing is

81
00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:45.600
2049 when they will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the company.

82
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:46.643
<v 1>Just revolution.</v>

83
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.580
<v 0>What once might have been a remote possibility has no, perhaps become a,</v>

84
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.050
not so improbable threat.

85
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.600
The G Jang Penn government,

86
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.990
perhaps as a way of politically compensating for the economic slowdown that

87
00:05:03.991 --> 00:05:08.040
China has experienced in recent years has set in motion, a nationalist agenda.

88
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.010
The likes of which has not been seen for decades.

89
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.050
<v 2>China is doubling down on its territorial claims and that's causing conflict</v>

90
00:05:16.051 --> 00:05:17.760
across Asia, CNN,

91
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.830
China taking on more conflict around the world from remote Himalayan valleys to

92
00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:26.910
small tropical islands and Western capitals, and increasingly assertive.

93
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.330
China is taking on conflicts around the world, like never before,

94
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.330
as the United States retreats, Bangkok post.

95
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:34.410
<v 0>Let's put it this way.</v>

96
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.590
No sooner is China out of one fight than it is already in another.

97
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.310
And now given the coronavirus crisis, things could be even worse.

98
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.490
You know what better way is there to divert attention than to start a

99
00:05:44.491 --> 00:05:47.670
confrontation where national pride itself as its stake.

100
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.390
But do you want some concrete examples here? Well, take the South China sea,

101
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.410
I see dotted with small islands reefs and sun banks that is also crucial for

102
00:05:55.411 --> 00:05:58.430
world trade. Some of the world's busiest shipping routes pass through here,

103
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.360
practically a third of all global maritime trees. Well look at the way,

104
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:03.194
things are.

105
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.800
<v 1>Chinese.</v>

106
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.400
<v 0>Argues that practically all of the sea belongs to China,</v>

107
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.390
that it is part of its territorial waters as had no qualms about confronting at

108
00:06:16.391 --> 00:06:20.290
least five other countries regarding this claim, the Philippines, Vietnam,

109
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.910
Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei. And not only that to protect its claims.

110
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.110
Jaina has been building artificial islands on reefs and sun banks since 2014,

111
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.250
strongly to artificial islands on which airstrips Michele launching systems and

112
00:06:33.251 --> 00:06:35.140
air defenses have been installed. Of course,

113
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.320
the disapproval of the Chinese government by the international community has

114
00:06:38.321 --> 00:06:39.154
made a virtually.

115
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.263
<v 1>New difference.</v>

116
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.920
<v 0>A little further North and the East China sea.</v>

117
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.820
It maintains a territorial confrontation with the government of Japan over the

118
00:06:48.821 --> 00:06:51.940
Senkaku islands, a chain of Rocky and uninhabited islands,

119
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.450
which have nevertheless caused situations of great tension.

120
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.310
Also during the summer of 2020,

121
00:06:57.311 --> 00:07:00.190
there was a clash between Chinese and Indian soldiers in the Himalayas.

122
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.810
The event did not go beyond a brawl,

123
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.050
but we are talking about a B-roll that resulted in 20 casualties among Indian

124
00:07:05.051 --> 00:07:05.620
soldiers,

125
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.250
according to new Delhi and the occupation of about 40 kilometers squared of his

126
00:07:09.251 --> 00:07:13.530
territory on the border with China and in Hong Kong. What can we say about.

127
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:14.463
<v 1>Hong Kong?</v>

128
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.630
<v 0>China has forcibly imposed a new security law that is basically ending freedom</v>

129
00:07:22.631 --> 00:07:24.550
of expression and political participation.

130
00:07:24.551 --> 00:07:28.900
And what had been one of the freest places in the world for almost 70 years and

131
00:07:28.901 --> 00:07:30.910
my friends, we must keep one thing in mind here.

132
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.410
It might be hard for us to imagine,

133
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.410
but what we have seen in Hong Kong has been something like the equivalent of

134
00:07:35.411 --> 00:07:39.250
what it may have meant. If Warsaw pack troops had occupied West Berlin,

135
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.680
China has sidestepped international agreements,

136
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.100
the political regime that existed in the city state and the civil liberties of

137
00:07:45.101 --> 00:07:47.350
the Hong Kong people with impunity.

138
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:51.910
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

139
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:54.670
<v 0>All this. We have to add the trade war with the United States,</v>

140
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.980
the imposition of punitive tariffs against Australia,

141
00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.250
the persecution of local minorities as is the case with the weekers.

142
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.600
And of course the acts of pressure against Taiwan during 2020,

143
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.930
China had put its strategy of harassment and demolition into fifth gear.

144
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.960
The Chinese army has staged some of its largest air and Naval maneuvers,

145
00:08:10.961 --> 00:08:13.540
and a long time around Taiwan, including some exercises.

146
00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:17.230
The official Chinese press itself described as a real invasion drill.

147
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:17.860
In addition,

148
00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.490
China has not hesitated to violate Taiwanese airspace on repeated occasions,

149
00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:24.160
having their fighters and bombers crossed the so-called meddling,

150
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:25.090
the border of the device,

151
00:08:25.091 --> 00:08:27.790
the waters of the Taiwan Strait between the two countries.

152
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.840
We are talking about dozens and dozens of cases. During 2020 alone,

153
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:36.370
You see my friends for almost 60 years,

154
00:08:36.371 --> 00:08:40.480
the Chinese threat to Taiwan seemed more bravado than a real possibility. Why?

155
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.850
Because although the Taiwanese army was much smaller,

156
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:47.290
it has traditionally been much, much better armed as far superior technology,

157
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.190
better training and the support of the United States whose fleet to control to

158
00:08:51.191 --> 00:08:55.830
the region. However, in the last 15 years, everything has changed.

159
00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:03.050
China is executing a huge program of modernization of its armed forces.

160
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.010
To give you an idea.

161
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.820
Their air force currently has more fourth generation aircraft than all of the

162
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.300
planes of the Taiwanese air force is commissioning aircraft carriers,

163
00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.090
destroyers and vessels with amphibious transport capacity.

164
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.220
It has developed more than 1000 short range.

165
00:09:16.221 --> 00:09:20.030
Ballistic missiles aimed directly at Taiwan is continuously conducting maneuvers

166
00:09:20.031 --> 00:09:23.900
around the Island and even has an it division whose mission is to launch cyber

167
00:09:23.901 --> 00:09:27.470
attacks against strategic Taiwanese elements and be prepared to freeze their

168
00:09:27.471 --> 00:09:31.850
communications and key infrastructure if necessary. So for the first time,

169
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.600
the idea of a Chinese invasion does not seem so far fetched.

170
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.330
<v 2>Our concern is whether in times of war,</v>

171
00:09:38.331 --> 00:09:41.720
our command and control systems can function without hindrance,

172
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:44.930
whether the country could still be under effective command,

173
00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.400
wanting you deputy of the ruling democratic progressive party and the chairman

174
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:50.480
of the defense committee.

175
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:53.270
<v 0>And of course at this point, many of you are probably thinking,</v>

176
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:58.040
but grant the United States remains committed to the defense of Taiwan and yes,

177
00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:02.360
that's true, but the problem is how far does this commitment go?

178
00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:04.820
And is it enough and enormous.

179
00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:06.733
<v 1>Listen up</v>

180
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.940
strategic ambiguity.

181
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.120
<v 0>The United States officially cut off his relations with the Republic of China.</v>

182
00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:23.570
And that meant with Taiwan and auditor recognize the people's Republic of China.

183
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.080
By the way,

184
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.840
we have already covered this mess on visual politics videos that we'll link for

185
00:10:26.841 --> 00:10:27.860
you in the description,

186
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:30.980
the U S Congress approved to the Taiwan relations act a law,

187
00:10:30.981 --> 00:10:31.940
which reaffirms that.

188
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.330
Although the Taiwanese government is not recognized as the legitimate government

189
00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:36.560
of mainland China,

190
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.860
special commitments are maintained with the Island commitments,

191
00:10:39.861 --> 00:10:43.790
such as recognizing any non peaceful Chinese intervention as a threat reserving

192
00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:46.580
the right to come to Taiwan's defense and make available to them.

193
00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.730
I E sell them all the weapons they need. Well,

194
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.240
the fact is that from that moment on what came to be known as the policy of

195
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.880
strategic ambiguity was set in motion.

196
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.393
<v 1>Taiwan.</v>

197
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.730
<v 0>Acts did not strictly state that the United States would intervene in the event</v>

198
00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:06.980
of aggression, but it did reserve the right to do so.

199
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.850
It was an ambiguous strategy that ultimately paid off on the one hand.

200
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.150
Beijing has never been sure what the us response would be. Therefore,

201
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.100
they can't be sat in the attack on the Island.

202
00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:19.220
Won't lead to a direct war with the American power. On the other hand,

203
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:24.110
this strategic ambiguity meant the Taiwanese were never quite sure how far USAID

204
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.300
would go. So they had no choice,

205
00:11:26.301 --> 00:11:29.570
but to secure their own defenses while also improving their relations.

206
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:30.703
<v 1>With China.</v>

207
00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:34.341
<v 0>My friends,</v>

208
00:11:34.341 --> 00:11:37.940
the question we really need to ask ourself as how far does the U S commitment

209
00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:38.930
actually go?

210
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.170
Let me explain if the United States government was never able to commit to the

211
00:11:42.171 --> 00:11:45.380
defense of Taiwan when its military superiority was enormous,

212
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:49.250
will it really do so now with a China that has become a superpower?

213
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:53.770
This is not a minor question, especially for the Taiwanese, of course

214
00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:01.660
China's growing military power has not only become a threat to Taiwan's defacto

215
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:02.350
independence,

216
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:06.910
but also increases the price of U S involvement or conflict with China today

217
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.580
could well become the prelude to world war three.

218
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.690
<v 2>When the bullets really start flying the American people,</v>

219
00:12:12.691 --> 00:12:17.190
most of whom can't find Taiwan on a map, we'll be hard pressed to say, no,

220
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.830
I'm really willing to trade Los Angeles for Taipei,

221
00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.380
Michael Hunziker of George Mason university.

222
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:26.160
<v 0>And it's not only that the United States has geography against it. Why?</v>

223
00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:30.240
Because its capacity in the area depends on its Naval fleets and a handful of

224
00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.850
Asian basis with end range of Chinese muscles.

225
00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:36.090
And they may not be nimble enough to get there in time. And you know what?

226
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.250
The worst thing is that the same idea,

227
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.530
the suspicion that could be shared by the Chinese government,

228
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.350
but when the time comes, the reaction of the United States will be more,

229
00:12:43.351 --> 00:12:47.340
more than a formal protest as has happened with Hong Kong could fuel the Chinese

230
00:12:47.341 --> 00:12:48.660
intervention. In other words,

231
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:52.620
this policy of strategic ambiguity could act as a catalyst in this conflict

232
00:12:52.621 --> 00:12:53.010
today.

233
00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:56.430
That is precisely why many voices in Washington are calling for an end to this

234
00:12:56.431 --> 00:12:58.290
policy once. And for all.

235
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.990
<v 2>We need to make clearer where we stand,</v>

236
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:05.520
especially by ending any remaining ambiguity about how we'd react to the use of

237
00:13:05.521 --> 00:13:10.500
force and altering our military force structure and posture Elbridge Colby of

238
00:13:10.501 --> 00:13:14.880
former senior Pentagon official and co-author of the Trump administration's

239
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.380
national defense strike.

240
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:17.663
<v 0>On the other hand,</v>

241
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.880
it makes it clear that the Taiwanese have to be able to defend themselves at

242
00:13:20.881 --> 00:13:23.070
least for a while, until they can receive help.

243
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.720
But the question is who the hell do you defend yourself against a giant Lake

244
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:28.980
China and listen up?

245
00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:39.930
[inaudible] sending Taiwan [inaudible] well,

246
00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:43.290
despite all we have seen Taiwan is not a country that goes crazy with its

247
00:13:43.291 --> 00:13:47.130
military budget. Just to give you an idea, the defense spending plan for 2021,

248
00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.810
it's about 15.4 billion.

249
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:52.890
This is approximately between 2.2 and 2.4% of the country's GDP,

250
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:54.720
depending on what we count or don't count.

251
00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.410
It represents an increase of a little more than 10% compared to 2020.

252
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.320
But the truth is that if we look at the last 10 or 20 years,

253
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:04.560
what we are going to see is that the proportion of military spending has been

254
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:09.150
reduced. Check this out, curious,

255
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.740
isn't it, of course, at some point,

256
00:14:10.741 --> 00:14:13.530
this downward trend will probably cease to seem so strange to you.

257
00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:21.360
In any case, despite this apparent budgetary restraint. Over the past few years,

258
00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:25.050
the Taiwanese government has continued to close important deals to buy military

259
00:14:25.051 --> 00:14:29.070
equipment from the United States, very advanced military equipment. For example,

260
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.240
in 2019,

261
00:14:30.241 --> 00:14:34.500
it closed a $2 billion acquisition to acquire 108 Abrams

262
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.820
[inaudible] tanks. The American fighting vehicle par excellence.

263
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:43.770
Then in 2020 president sign and wing has pledged another $8 billion for 66

264
00:14:43.771 --> 00:14:46.470
state-of-the-art F sixteens. These are just two examples.

265
00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.480
We have to add missiles, Naval mines,

266
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.590
and a lot of technology and gadgets of all kinked in total,

267
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.920
more than $15 billion committed in the last two years alone.

268
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.720
And they're still pursuing the F 35,

269
00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:00.830
which has been another huge amount of multimillion dollar contracts. And that.

270
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.330
<v 1>It's not all the time.</v>

271
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:07.480
<v 0>Government is also spending billions to boost local production,</v>

272
00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:10.150
helicopter carriers, destroyers, and their own fighters.

273
00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:14.380
They're even developing the rune submarines a cost of over $1 billion per unit.

274
00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.350
The first one is expected to enter service in 2025.

275
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.033
<v 1>What.</v>

276
00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:25.570
<v 0>Because the truth is that all of this may serve practically no purpose.</v>

277
00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:29.620
<v 1>Right?</v>

278
00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.520
<v 0>Well, because the difference with China is still enormous. And evidently.</v>

279
00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:35.193
<v 1>Check this out.</v>

280
00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:42.280
<v 0>China and Taiwan had practically the same budget at the end of the 1990s today,</v>

281
00:15:42.281 --> 00:15:45.730
the Chinese giants budget is 25 times greater.

282
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:49.510
And obviously that has a direct reflection on the capabilities of the two

283
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:50.050
armies.

284
00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:53.680
Look at how the Chinese foreign ministry itself has assessed the increase in

285
00:15:53.681 --> 00:15:56.350
Taiwan's military budget and names for 2021, right?

286
00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.730
<v 2>No matter how much you spend, as we all know, Taiwan is a small Island.</v>

287
00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.410
If you want to fight mainland China,

288
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:07.300
it's like an ant trying to move a tree jowly Xian spokesperson for the Chinese

289
00:16:07.301 --> 00:16:08.350
ministry of foreign affairs.

290
00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:12.070
<v 0>As you can see the most likely scenario in the event of a Chinese attack,</v>

291
00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:15.250
as many experts have suggested is that in a relatively short time,

292
00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.080
a large part of the Taiwanese air force,

293
00:16:17.081 --> 00:16:20.500
most of the Naval force and a lot of key infrastructure would be destroyed,

294
00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.980
raised and nailed it. And as if that wasn't enough,

295
00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.780
all of the problems don't end there,

296
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:28.930
it seems that the Taiwanese army that does not participate in international

297
00:16:28.931 --> 00:16:31.030
missions also has a training problem.

298
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.330
Let's just say that it's not hard to find officers who have never actually used

299
00:16:34.331 --> 00:16:35.890
heavy weapons in the field

300
00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.460
Matters worse. The shortage of soldiers as another headache,

301
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.380
Taiwan is not exactly a young country,

302
00:16:44.381 --> 00:16:47.410
and there are young people who prepare to devote their lives to other tasks.

303
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.530
Just to give you an idea between 1993 and 2020,

304
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.880
the number of troops in Taiwan's armed forces has been reduced by more than 60%.

305
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:58.600
It has gone from 500,000 to less than 200,000 soldiers.

306
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:01.660
<v 1>What's.</v>

307
00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:05.950
<v 0>At this point, the question is, how on earth can Taiwan be defended? This,</v>

308
00:17:05.951 --> 00:17:07.630
my friends is the million dollar question

309
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:15.700
Last video, which I will link for you in the description.

310
00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.580
We told you what the political and economic strategy was. Well,

311
00:17:18.581 --> 00:17:20.110
my friends from the defense point of view,

312
00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:23.590
according to most analysts and the Pentagon's own recommendations,

313
00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:27.790
Taiwan could only succeed by completely turning around its military strategy

314
00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:30.280
that is instead of buying expensive military equipment,

315
00:17:30.281 --> 00:17:31.540
that would be practically worthless.

316
00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:35.500
Taiwan has to focus primarily on making the envision such a rescue mission,

317
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.980
but the Chinese would consider it impossible. And in order to do that,

318
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:42.100
it has to take advantage of its own unique characteristics.

319
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.650
For example, their geography works somewhat in their favor.

320
00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.390
Taiwan only has 14 that are considered suitable for Marine invasion.

321
00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:55.620
The rest of the 1,200 kilometers of coastline is protected by reefs rocks.

322
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.950
Cliffs are concrete peers and friends in order to invade,

323
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.400
China would have to carry out the largest landing in history.

324
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.640
So you can already see, it would not be easy at all. In addition,

325
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:09.240
the terrain is mountainous and the flat areas are either urbanized or flooded

326
00:18:09.241 --> 00:18:10.020
with rice fields,

327
00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.410
which makes it serene complicated for large deployments and very conductive to

328
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.400
asymmetric warfare.

329
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:20.610
And my friends that is the key asymmetric warfare.

330
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:25.130
<v 1>Most analysts.</v>

331
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:28.460
<v 0>And certainly experts of the Pentagon think that this is the path that Taiwan</v>

332
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:29.900
should take to recompose.

333
00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:32.480
Their reserves officially made up of 2 million members,

334
00:18:32.481 --> 00:18:34.970
but that when it comes to the crunch, lack training,

335
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:39.410
train them and prepare them properly acquire many mobile weapons, Naval mines,

336
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.320
cheap and agile systems drones, many drones,

337
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:45.530
small boats are autonomous of measureables land mains missiles,

338
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:49.370
modern anti aircraft sets. Them's subterranean operations and supply systems,

339
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.760
radars and missile launch batteries and side mountains, drones,

340
00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:57.020
more drones and myself factories protected from air fire, et cetera, et cetera,

341
00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.320
et cetera. In short, be prepared to contain the enemy,

342
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.870
to be able to hold out until reinforcements arrive at,

343
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.880
to make things so difficult for the Chinese,

344
00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:07.730
that they will consider it essentially impossible.

345
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.970
We're talking about a strategy that does not require large resources,

346
00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:15.290
which is argued for by experts in Washington and which president site and when

347
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.310
no seems to have decided to implement, to prepare for gorilla warfare.

348
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.010
Unfortunately, however, this does not end the threat.

349
00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.920
At least not completely China could try to block it. The Island,

350
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:25.820
instead of invading it,

351
00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:29.690
it could seek a kind of economic war and it could even establish specific

352
00:19:29.691 --> 00:19:30.320
punishments.

353
00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.070
And so now the questions at hand are what should the international community do

354
00:19:34.071 --> 00:19:36.920
to safeguard Taiwan's independence, stand idly by,

355
00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:40.490
as it has done with Hong Kong or mobilize and support of the Island,

356
00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.460
if mobilization is chosen, what exactly should be done?

357
00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:47.960
And just how many Chinese bots where we get in the comments leader answers along
