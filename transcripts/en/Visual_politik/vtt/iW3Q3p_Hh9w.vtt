<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.250
<v 1>Argentina. Yup. Yup. Argentina, once again is in the spotlight. Honestly,</v>

3
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.420
I give you my word.

4
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.330
It's not that we here at visual politic habit and for this country,

5
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.410
or even particularly mean to focus on it, but what can we see?

6
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.830
Argentina is the country that during the first half of the 20th century was the

7
00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:32.510
great Latin American superpower.

8
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.200
It just keeps on giving us bad news to talk about. For example,

9
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.070
relatively recently,

10
00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:40.490
we told you here on this channel about the habit being rocked by the world's

11
00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:43.100
longest warranty at the time of making this video,

12
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.170
even though it was no longer quite so strict,

13
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.790
Argentines have been in confinement or restricted activity for more than 250

14
00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:52.970
days. As you can imagine, this is something that is setting the economy,

15
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.390
heart and economy that already had been having a lot of problems,

16
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.420
even by Argentinian standards since 2018.

17
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.900
So you could say that the Corona virus has been something like the nail in the

18
00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:06.680
coffin, a very hard blue that is already having many consequences.

19
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.460
In particular.

20
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.520
One of them is a wave of companies that are seriously considering leaving

21
00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:13.490
Argentina. Even though this could incur great financial losses,

22
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.290
of course weighing up the situation.

23
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.960
Many are thinking the staying could be much worse,

24
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.590
but what companies are we referring to and why are they considering leaving

25
00:01:21.591 --> 00:01:25.190
Argentina? Why exactly is the current situation in this troubled country?

26
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.370
And this video, we're going to give you all the details. But before we do,

27
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.370
I just want to remind you of our new channel visual Academy, March.

28
00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:35.270
The end of the Holy Roman empire is made from the whole team here at visual

29
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.460
politic. I'm going to cover some of the most interesting people,

30
00:01:37.461 --> 00:01:39.320
places and periods in history.

31
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.830
Do you want to know more of a Gangas can of course you do well by the ancient

32
00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:44.960
Greeks, obviously they're pretty cool.

33
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.450
And the invented democracy and my personal favorite,

34
00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:50.540
you can find out all about the Vikings. It's got amazing animation,

35
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.170
fantastic storytelling, and some voiceovers that you might recognize.

36
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.100
So check out visual Academy here on YouTube and know all that.

37
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.230
<v 0>Potential power.</v>

38
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.951
<v 1>And my friends.</v>

39
00:02:09.951 --> 00:02:13.550
Every time we talk about Argentina is almost impossible for us to not be

40
00:02:13.551 --> 00:02:15.070
surprised by its perpetual,

41
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.280
inability to escape from what we can know openly call the problem of the

42
00:02:19.281 --> 00:02:22.190
permanent crisis. After all, if we think about it,

43
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.550
clinically Argentina is a country with enormous potential,

44
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.540
a qualified population, plenty of cultural activity, a reasonably good climate,

45
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.590
a lot of natural resources, a large territory, et cetera, et cetera.

46
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.380
The list of positive attributes is very long.

47
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.560
And of course this observation is not unique to us,

48
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.600
nor are we the first ones to bring it to life

49
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.330
Way back in the 1960s, eventual Nobel prize winner.

50
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.720
Simon Kuznets stated that there were four types of countries according to their

51
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.860
economic performance,

52
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.560
the developed the underdeveloped Argentina and the

53
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:02.650
economic evolution of the countries that were in the first two groups could be

54
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:06.010
explained without many problems, but in the case of Japan and Argentina,

55
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.160
their evolution was exactly the opposite of what could be expected,

56
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.430
Japan for the better and Argentina for the worse,

57
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.260
another Nobel prize winner in economics.

58
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.370
Paul Samuelson described Argentina situation in 1980 in this way,

59
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:19.500
less than half.

60
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.570
<v 2>If someone had asked me in 1945,</v>

61
00:03:21.571 --> 00:03:25.410
what part of the world do you expect to experience the most dramatic economic

62
00:03:25.411 --> 00:03:27.030
takeoff in the next three decades?

63
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.290
I would probably give a similar answer to the one below Argentina is the wave of

64
00:03:31.291 --> 00:03:33.030
the future. It has a temperate climate,

65
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.230
its population density offers a favorable endowment of natural resources per

66
00:03:37.231 --> 00:03:39.120
employee by historical accident.

67
00:03:39.121 --> 00:03:43.500
Its current population constitutes the most homogenous progeny of the nations of

68
00:03:43.501 --> 00:03:47.880
Western Europe and the Argentina of 1945 is that intermediate state of

69
00:03:47.881 --> 00:03:52.200
development from which one can easily expect rapid growth. Paul Samuelson

70
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.530
[inaudible] exterior volume, 30 number eight, Mexico, August,

71
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.600
1980 pages eight 21 to eight 29.

72
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.430
<v 1>So I don't think we're going too far.</v>

73
00:04:05.431 --> 00:04:09.300
If we define Argentina as a lost opportunity and not just once,

74
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.350
but several times,

75
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.980
For example, during the last 30 years,

76
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.430
the world has experienced economic growth as never seen before. However,

77
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.670
Argentina has been underperforming since the 1940s,

78
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.740
since the imagines of Dwan Domingo, Peron,

79
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.100
they keep applying practically the same policies and getting the same results.

80
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.520
This is something we have already covered in several videos here on visual

81
00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:35.880
politic. In fact, since the advent of democracy in 1983,

82
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.110
Argentina has been ruled by Peronism for 25 of the last 37 years.

83
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.810
And if we only focus on the province of windows eddies,

84
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.680
which is the largest and most populated in the country for 29 of those 37 years,

85
00:04:46.681 --> 00:04:51.060
Peruna ism has ruined that is almost 80% of the time to make matters worse.

86
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.910
The rest of the leaders have not destined themselves much from policies that we

87
00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:58.380
can almost consider typical for Argentina. There is Argentinian as Mara Donna.

88
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.060
Well, the point is that no,

89
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.230
in 2022 elements have come together that are capable of making even the hardiest

90
00:05:04.231 --> 00:05:07.650
investor nervous, the Corona virus and a new government.

91
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.290
You see my friends on the 10th of December, 2019,

92
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.510
Alberto Fernandez took over the presidency,

93
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.140
although it's not clear exactly how far has power extends and how far the,

94
00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:20.070
of his vice-president, the powerful Ms. Christina Fernandez. The Kitchener does.

95
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.960
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

96
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.680
<v 1>In all fairness,</v>

97
00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.490
Alberto Fernandez came to the presidency of a badly damaged country under very

98
00:05:29.491 --> 00:05:33.390
precarious conditions because if the legacy that Maricio McCree received in his

99
00:05:33.391 --> 00:05:34.590
day was not exactly great.

100
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.530
So the one he left behind certainly doesn't have anything to envy.

101
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.180
We have covered this topic in detail,

102
00:05:39.181 --> 00:05:42.210
in a previous video here on visual politic high unemployment,

103
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.200
high public spending,

104
00:05:43.201 --> 00:05:46.620
high inflation and a considerable drop in the central banks reserves practically

105
00:05:46.621 --> 00:05:49.200
all the indicators were very, very red.

106
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.240
And to top it all off two months after he came to office,

107
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.460
the Corona virus crisis Brocade turning the global upside down and leaving

108
00:05:58.461 --> 00:06:00.380
Argentina, almost like a desert,

109
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.000
the most conservative forecasts point to a 12% fall in GDP in 2020,

110
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.910
an unemployment rate above 22% poverty rate,

111
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:12.590
close to 45% and inflation that could exceed the 50% barrier. In other words,

112
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:16.220
we could be talking about an economic tsunami rather than a perfect storm.

113
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.850
And remember,

114
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.840
this is taking place in a country that has been going from bad to worse since

115
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:24.530
2012, we've already mentioned the baggage received from previous governments,

116
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.650
but the truth is the policies is the current government could make things even

117
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:28.580
worse. Listen up.

118
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.910
<v 0>Turning their backs on the world.</v>

119
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.730
<v 1>And Argentinian government has a unique plan to get out of the crisis.</v>

120
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.040
A plan as unique as,

121
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.860
as peculiar and so far as it involves doing the opposite of what most countries

122
00:06:47.861 --> 00:06:50.560
that have gone through a crisis have done in order to get out of it.

123
00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.540
So do you want some examples? Well,

124
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.020
let's take a look at two of president Oberto Fernandez policies that have the

125
00:06:56.021 --> 00:06:58.540
most impact on the Argentinian economy. First of all,

126
00:06:58.541 --> 00:06:59.890
we have the exchange controls.

127
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.290
You see the Argentine government uses money as humans.

128
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.770
This is particularly known as the money-making machine to finance a large part

129
00:07:05.771 --> 00:07:06.760
of public expenditure.

130
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.630
This is something that the Argentine government has been doing for decades to

131
00:07:13.631 --> 00:07:17.080
the point that the value of their local currency has practically disappeared.

132
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.530
This is the cause of the enormous inflation that year after year plagues the

133
00:07:20.531 --> 00:07:21.010
country,

134
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.220
and also explains why Argentines always jumped at the chance to switch to the

135
00:07:24.221 --> 00:07:25.054
dollar. Yes,

136
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.760
when [inaudible] is one of those places where you can get discounts,

137
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.410
if you pay and foreign currency

138
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.030
And an effort to stop the collapse of the peso,

139
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.340
the government applies exchange controls this way.

140
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.820
If you want to buy dollars in the official market about 80 pesos per dollar,

141
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.150
you will have to meet a series of requirements, which is usually difficult.

142
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.310
That's why the alternative is the black market where the dollar doesn't trade

143
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:51.370
ATP. So it was around 145. In addition, if you're a company that exports,

144
00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.100
the government will take away the dollars you receive and change them into

145
00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:58.000
pesos, the official exchange rate about 80 pesos. But of course,

146
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.160
if you want to buy dollars again, for example,

147
00:08:00.161 --> 00:08:02.980
to pay for imports and you can't get them on the official market,

148
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.310
you have to get them on the black market at 145 pesos.

149
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.750
Each that's a loss of almost 40%. In addition, foreign companies have a very,

150
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.570
very difficult time getting their hands on any benefits,

151
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:14.590
reaped from the country.

152
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.440
So you see that things aren't easy for Argentina exporters,

153
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.350
or at least I personally would not like to be one of them.

154
00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.860
And then we have the labor regime, which was already costly in Argentina,

155
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.500
but during the pandemic, as even prohibited layoffs,

156
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.410
as illustrated in this quote from Alberto Fernandez.

157
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.940
<v 2>As I said at the [inaudible], no one is saved alone. You have to be supportive,</v>

158
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:38.860
put yourself in the other shoes and help them.

159
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.460
Some miserable people forget those who work for them. And in the crisis,

160
00:08:42.461 --> 00:08:45.580
they fire them to those wretches Pope Francis spoke.

161
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.870
Now I tell them that I will not let them do it. Oberto Fernandez on Twitter.

162
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.070
<v 1>All sound pretty good, but usually reality is a little bit different.</v>

163
00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.720
Imagine that you have a company right now because of the pandemic has low sales

164
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.220
or even no sales.

165
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.610
If you can't make stopping adjustments or resort to strategies to reduce losses,

166
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.540
even temporarily,

167
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:06.450
then the whole company may end up closing dime and all the workers will be out

168
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:08.550
on the streets. Reality is sometimes unpleasant,

169
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.850
but if you turn your back on it, you might have a problem. In any case,

170
00:09:11.851 --> 00:09:15.000
Fernandez messages don't seem to be the best for encouraging investment in the

171
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:16.110
country, but that's not all,

172
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.240
it's not just the current crisis the country is going through.

173
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.240
And the kind of policies that have been put in place so far in 2020,

174
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.180
if we also add those that were already in place, such as Argentina,

175
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.480
being in the top three countries in the world for imposing the highest taxes on

176
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:28.170
businesses.

177
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.780
And we can already understand why many companies are starting to consider

178
00:09:30.781 --> 00:09:34.770
fleeing or at least stopping any investment altogether. In fact,

179
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.500
according to a UN report, even before the Corona virus,

180
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.860
Argentina was the second country on the list for the worst evolution of foreign

181
00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:43.380
direct investment so far in the 21st century.

182
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.830
Imagine their ranking now and take note because it's not just a boat.

183
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:47.833
<v 0>Companies.</v>

184
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:52.130
According to us.

185
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.910
<v 1>Survey conducted by the consulting firm to and research strategy and association</v>

186
00:09:55.911 --> 00:09:58.340
with the company's inclusion. And Guesty on our patio.

187
00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.670
I have 10 Argentinians were able to weigh up what their situation will be like

188
00:10:01.671 --> 00:10:05.000
in 10 years with leave the country if they have the conditions to do so.

189
00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.030
The bottom lane is the Argentinians with the capacity to think about the long

190
00:10:08.031 --> 00:10:09.270
term or thinking about.

191
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:13.070
<v 0>We've been on the other hand.</v>

192
00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:13.820
<v 1>In September,</v>

193
00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.910
the financial times published a report in which it proposes the exit of a

194
00:10:16.911 --> 00:10:19.850
growing number of foreign companies from the country. For example,

195
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.330
the Buenos Aires correspondent of this newspaper told her at the same time that

196
00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:27.380
the minister of economy Martin Guzman was presenting the 2021 budget with

197
00:10:27.381 --> 00:10:28.880
relatively optimistic projections,

198
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.400
but Chilean department store company file Bella, uh,

199
00:10:31.401 --> 00:10:33.650
noticed his progressive exit from Argentina.

200
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.800
It will start with the immediate closure of four of the 19 stores they have in

201
00:10:36.801 --> 00:10:39.590
the country while they look up buyer for the rest of the operations.

202
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.890
But having said that, I'm sure many of you are thinking, but wait a minute,

203
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.590
grunt, isn't this an isolated case, something specific,

204
00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.880
are there really more companies who want to bail out in a market of 45 million

205
00:10:49.881 --> 00:10:51.440
people? Well, yeah,

206
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.980
the truth is that there are more and more companies are starting to propose this

207
00:10:54.981 --> 00:10:58.550
strategy. This is the case with airlines. For example, in June,

208
00:10:58.610 --> 00:10:59.510
the Chilean airline,

209
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.440
LATAN confirmed this departure from the country and began to negotiate with its

210
00:11:03.441 --> 00:11:07.340
1,700 employees. It happened in Argentina for 15 years,

211
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.810
maintain flights to 12 local destinations and held a 16% market

212
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.150
LATAN was followed by air New Zealand,

213
00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.910
which has confirmed that even one's normal air travel is restored.

214
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:23.240
It will no longer provide connecting services between New Zealand on the land of

215
00:11:23.241 --> 00:11:27.410
tango. Exactly the same news was announced by Qatar airways in August Emirates,

216
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.110
an instant suspension of its operations for an indefinite period.

217
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.600
A Norwegian airlines has sold its domestic operations.

218
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:33.733
<v 0>In the company.</v>

219
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.710
<v 1>Obviously a lot of airlines are having some trouble with the Corona virus,</v>

220
00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.690
but it's not just the airlines and fire Bella.

221
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.660
Many other companies from very different sectors are considering following the

222
00:11:44.661 --> 00:11:45.830
same steps. Of course,

223
00:11:45.831 --> 00:11:48.590
most of them are very cautious because they obviously want to reduce the

224
00:11:48.591 --> 00:11:51.440
conflict. And at the same time, try to sell their businesses.

225
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.340
You see that Chilean are leaving because.

226
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.430
<v 2>There was a clear anti market anti-business bias.</v>

227
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:02.110
So it is worrisome that Alberto Fernandez administration continues in that line.

228
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.830
One CTO, president of the Confederation for production and consumption.

229
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.040
<v 1>Between 1919, 2016.</v>

230
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.820
Chile has certainly been the second largest investor in Argentina, after Brazil.

231
00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.540
In any case,

232
00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.660
some companies have already announced their intentions that is they're going to

233
00:12:15.661 --> 00:12:18.120
leave or at least reduce their presence considerably.

234
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.670
Do you want to know which ones then let's start with a list.

235
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:25.380
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

236
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.560
<v 1>German chemical company bus has announced the transfer of a large part of his</v>

237
00:12:28.561 --> 00:12:31.890
operations to Brazil. The same as being done by the French company, Sango bane,

238
00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.160
which has moved its windshield production to Brazil and has closed its factory

239
00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:37.920
and the town of component in the province of winter Saudis.

240
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.410
During the month of July, the French laboratory company,

241
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:43.950
Pierre Fabry sold his installations and concluded his activity in the country.

242
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.070
The same was done by the German packaging and pharmaceutical supplies company.

243
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:50.880
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

244
00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.000
<v 1>This was on Ray star, a manufacturer of cell phones for brands,</v>

245
00:12:54.001 --> 00:12:58.080
such as Samsung and LG as a plant in Rio grenade with 500 employees has

246
00:12:58.081 --> 00:13:01.440
finalized the sale of his production facilities in the country in exchange for

247
00:13:01.441 --> 00:13:03.900
the symbolic figure of $1. Let's just say,

248
00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:08.730
but their priority was to leave at any price for S part a bedroom company. Nike,

249
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.040
I noticed that at the beginning of the year that it was transferring us

250
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:13.800
operations and the country, along with those in Brazil, Chile,

251
00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.200
and Uruguay to the Mexican company axle,

252
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.190
then there's also the North American giant Walmart that has 92 establishments

253
00:13:20.191 --> 00:13:23.760
distributed in 21 provinces and the employees more than 10,000 people,

254
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.400
they have also confirmed that they are seeking to leave completely.

255
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:29.010
They're looking for a buyer for its Argentina activities.

256
00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.960
Everything indicates an addition to those companies.

257
00:13:30.961 --> 00:13:32.790
We have mentioned companies such as soda,

258
00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.580
muck burger King and Starbucks would also leave Argentina.

259
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.380
If they phoned someone to take over their business,

260
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.150
You see my friends, this trend seems to be the last stage of a long process.

261
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.660
I seen Argentina become a country allergic to foreign investment to put this in

262
00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:49.290
perspective,

263
00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:52.830
the land of tango has gone from representing around 20% of all foreign

264
00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:55.770
investment coming into Latin America to less than 5%.

265
00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.070
Obviously any foreign company leaving the country as bad news,

266
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.070
large international groups have a greater capacity to invest more.

267
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.300
Know-how more modern management systems and usually more technology at the same

268
00:14:06.301 --> 00:14:06.630
time,

269
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:10.050
the great economic success stories of the world and their success by attracting

270
00:14:10.051 --> 00:14:13.530
investment. And in many other places, we find new stories like this one.

271
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:18.900
<v 2>A Swiss Canton will soon surpass Hong Kong is the best tax Haven in the world</v>

272
00:14:18.901 --> 00:14:19.710
for companies.

273
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:23.310
Hong Kong will soon lose its status as the place with the lowest corporate tax

274
00:14:23.311 --> 00:14:27.450
in the world and will be replaced by the small mountainous Canton of [inaudible]

275
00:14:27.451 --> 00:14:28.284
in Switzerland,

276
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:33.060
Bloomberg Greece to offer a 50% tax break for returning professionals

277
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.100
and digital migrants writers.

278
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:38.850
<v 1>The case of Argentina is unique because this country aspires to get endless</v>

279
00:14:38.851 --> 00:14:42.150
crisis by doing exactly the opposite by scaring off foreign investment,

280
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.360
imposing more taxes, more currency exchange controls, and much,

281
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.410
much more regulation, perhaps that is precisely why as an eternal crisis.

282
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:50.970
What do you think at this point?

283
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.980
It's your turn to tell us what future do you think awaits Argentina will that

284
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.600
manage to overcome the current crisis?

285
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.060
Does it really matter to all these big companies are leaving?

286
00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.090
And if you are watching us from that country, as we know, many of you are,

287
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.220
how do you rate our bear tool, Fernandez management?

288
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:05.990
What do you think he should change?
