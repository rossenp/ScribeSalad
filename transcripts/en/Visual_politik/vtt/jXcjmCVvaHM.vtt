1
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.020
<v 1>Is one of those historical oddities whereby a piece of land ends up becoming a</v>

2
00:00:09.021 --> 00:00:11.990
kind of Russian Island in the middle of the European union,

3
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.770
a place surrounded on all sides by countries, belonging to the European union,

4
00:00:15.771 --> 00:00:19.730
and also NATO, something like Vladimir Putin's, Trojan, horse friends.

5
00:00:19.731 --> 00:00:22.700
We are talking about a place with a population of less than a million,

6
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.500
and which is economically insignificant $7 billion of GDP, or in other words,

7
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.350
some $7,300 of GDP per year.

8
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.573
<v 0>What's up.</v>

9
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.740
<v 1>Say that besides being the land that saw the birth of the philosopher,</v>

10
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:37.610
Emmanuel Kant,

11
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.650
this place located almost 400 kilometers away as the Crow flies from the great

12
00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:46.400
Russian landmass is a little more than a giant military base today.

13
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.100
Its value as a commercial, financial or industrial,

14
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.820
and clave is practically insignificant despite being located in the center of

15
00:00:52.821 --> 00:00:56.270
Europe. If the Colleen and grid of blast were an independent country,

16
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.090
it would be poorer than countries like Peru or Gabon.

17
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.630
To give you an idea it's per capita. GDP is less than half of that,

18
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.740
of neighboring Poland and much of its economy depends directly on the Russian

19
00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:07.850
armed forces station.

20
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.020
As you can imagine, back in the days of the cold war and the Warsaw pact,

21
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.830
this enclave was under Soviet sovereignty and that was not a problem today.

22
00:01:18.831 --> 00:01:20.810
However, things are very different.

23
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.840
Glenn and Greg has become a challenge for its neighboring countries,

24
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.410
a political and above all big military challenge friends.

25
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.950
Would you like to know more about this little known and amazing place? Well.

26
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.143
<v 0>That's good.</v>

27
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.060
<v 1>Friends of visual politics to understand what glean and Greg is today.</v>

28
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.120
We cannot ignore its history. So before we get to Kaliningrad,

29
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.330
we have to talk a little bit about Prussia, Germany, and also the Soviet union,

30
00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.140
This Russian enclave, which was under German sovereignty until 1945.

31
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.940
We sounded by the Teutonic Knights in 1255 under the name of Koenigs Berg

32
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.600
during the crusade to conquer and Christianized Prussian territory.

33
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.100
From that moment on the city,

34
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.310
Koenigsberg prospered as an important commercial enclave.

35
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.080
It was part of the Hanseatic league and was the Capitol of Prussia for 300 years

36
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.640
until in 1815 pressure became a founding state of the German Confederation and

37
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.520
fuss. The city came under German sovereignty. However,

38
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.600
the history of Koenigsberg took a bit of a turning point in 1945 during the

39
00:02:29.601 --> 00:02:32.930
second world war between January and April, 1945,

40
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:36.890
very harsh battles before that culminated in the total destruction of the city

41
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.550
and the capture of almost 100,000 German soldiers by the red army.

42
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.700
Then after the end of the war, in order to control it strategic port,

43
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.920
which was also free of ice during the winter,

44
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.720
the Soviet union annex to this place,

45
00:02:47.721 --> 00:02:50.930
drop to the name Konigsberg and renamed it in honor of the Bolshevik

46
00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:54.290
revolutionary Mikhail cleaning with the name that we all know today.

47
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.130
<v 0>So what do think happened after.</v>

48
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.270
<v 1>The Russian annexation?</v>

49
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.470
<v 0>Well.</v>

50
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.101
<v 1>The Germans live in,</v>

51
00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:09.180
in cleaning rod were forcibly expelled from the region between 1947 and

52
00:03:09.181 --> 00:03:10.110
1948.

53
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.130
And the blast was colonized with Soviet families from areas destroyed by the war

54
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.940
and by the military, a lot of military, yeah, that's South Joseph Stalin road.

55
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.380
The point is that this is how Kaliningrad basically became what is today a huge

56
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.500
amphibious military base Naval air and land,

57
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.490
a base that saw its strategic importance only increased with the end of the

58
00:03:29.491 --> 00:03:31.860
Soviet era and the fall of the Eastern block.

59
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.100
Since then it has become a Russian stronghold in the heart of now.

60
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.050
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

61
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.840
<v 2>A Russian army in the middle of the EU.</v>

62
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.510
<v 1>Pay attention to this data,</v>

63
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.160
nearly 20,000 soldiers stationed and 58 Naval units among which we can find

64
00:03:50.161 --> 00:03:54.120
destroyers for Gates, missile launches, submarines, torpedo boats,

65
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.050
and assault ships more than 800 tanks and 1200 armored vehicles,

66
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.030
345 artillery systems of over a hundred millimeter caliber and almost 200

67
00:04:03.031 --> 00:04:04.710
aircraft and helicopters friends.

68
00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:07.500
These are just some of the details of are known about the current Russian

69
00:04:07.501 --> 00:04:09.620
deployment and this kind of a macro military

70
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.300
Because the inventory could actually be higher because the Euromaidan riots in

71
00:04:18.301 --> 00:04:22.350
Ukraine and the annexation of the crime mere tension between Europe and Russia

72
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.100
escalated.

73
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.570
This led to a kind of arms stockpiling in 2014 that has continued to this day

74
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.150
and has left a trail of news headlines like this.

75
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.620
<v 2>Trump confirms more us troops will be sent to Poland, DW,</v>

76
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.380
Russia forms, new division deploys,

77
00:04:37.381 --> 00:04:40.650
more ships and aircraft and Kaelin and grit reports,

78
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.360
L R T U S tanks and troops headed to Lithuania for

79
00:04:45.361 --> 00:04:47.850
lengthy deployment stars and stripes. Yeah.

80
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.510
<v 1>Diplomatic relations between the West and Russia are colder than ever,</v>

81
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.790
but pay special attention to this headline.

82
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.020
<v 2>Russia deploys Eskander nuclear capable missiles to Colin and grads.</v>

83
00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.580
Are I a Reuters?

84
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.400
<v 1>In addition to this list of trips that we've mentioned,</v>

85
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.820
Putin's government has deployed what is considered to be the cream of its

86
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.690
critical weaponry to Colleen and grit, a type of weaponry that you only deploy.

87
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.260
If you want to raise the threat to something like a state of imminent war,

88
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.350
that is a level of threats that takes us back to the times of the day.

89
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.610
<v 0>Cold war. We.</v>

90
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.500
<v 1>Above all about the Iskander missile launch brigades missiles with nuclear</v>

91
00:05:25.501 --> 00:05:29.730
capability and whose launch systems are capable of attacking simultaneously with

92
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.280
32 such projectiles in a single salvage.

93
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.690
These missiles have a range of between 380 and 500 kilometers depending on their

94
00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:40.620
variant. The Iskander K for example, can reach up to 500 kilometers,

95
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.160
which would allow them to attack practically any position in Poland, Latvia,

96
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.780
Lithuania. This obviously includes NATO military bases in the area. Furthermore,

97
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.270
the launch system is mobile located on a kind of truck,

98
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.620
which allows them to change locations and be undetected with some.

99
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:55.523
<v 0>Ease.</v>

100
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.790
<v 1>And remember that the danger is not only in the controversial is scanned as they</v>

101
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:05.150
have gleaned. And it is also a real air raid fortress.

102
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.720
If the Russian military industry has stood out for anything in recent years,

103
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.320
it has been above all for its S 400 anti-aircraft system,

104
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.580
very advanced anti-aircraft system that Russia exports halfway around the world.

105
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.630
We are talking about a system capable of shooting down almost any enemy aircraft

106
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:22.370
within 250 kilometers.

107
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.060
And that means that Russia could control the passage of NATO aircraft between

108
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:29.180
Western Europe and the Baltic countries from its cleaning grid base.

109
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.880
<v 0>Wow.</v>

110
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.390
<v 1>The fact is that this entire system of land sea and air armaments,</v>

111
00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.650
which combines both offensive and defensive equipment constitutes a military

112
00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:45.490
strategy called [inaudible] this strategy or military capability,

113
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.870
which go beyond the acronym anti-access area denial consists of creating a

114
00:06:49.871 --> 00:06:54.010
virtually armored zone where an army is able to control any possible enemy

115
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.670
military movement to the millimeter. And when I say any movement,

116
00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.740
I'm talking about land sea and air,

117
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.210
And I'm sure that as you can imagine,

118
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.720
that something like that situated practically in the heart of Europe is

119
00:07:07.721 --> 00:07:10.360
something that is of great concern to the members of NATO,

120
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.960
especially its Eastern European members. To a large extent.

121
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.650
This is indicative of the more strange political relations with Russia.

122
00:07:17.651 --> 00:07:19.510
Since the cold war to give you an idea,

123
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.040
confidence is so low that the Polish army has erected six observation towers

124
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.250
along the border with Kaliningrad and they've done so with funding from the

125
00:07:27.251 --> 00:07:28.210
European union,

126
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.780
each tower is about 50 meters high and equipped with surveillance and tracking

127
00:07:31.781 --> 00:07:35.230
equipment to monitor Russian movements along its 200 kilometer border.

128
00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.110
But hold on a moment because if we leave the military retention aside,

129
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.050
the truth is that on the social level, the level of the people,

130
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.100
the picture is somewhat to do.

131
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.910
<v 0>See.</v>

132
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:47.500
<v 1>Since the fall of the Soviet union,</v>

133
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.920
the exchange of people between Kaliningrad and the Polish city of Gdansk has

134
00:07:50.921 --> 00:07:54.580
been constant more than 6 million people poles and Russians from gleaning grad

135
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.330
cross the border every year, just before the post Crimea tension escalated.

136
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.960
After all,

137
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.590
we are talking about cities that are just over a hundred kilometers away by car.

138
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.560
So it was common for the Russian population to travel, to Gdansk,

139
00:08:05.561 --> 00:08:09.100
to buy products that they did not have access to in Kaliningrad. And of course,

140
00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.040
you know that when there is such an extensive and continual exchange of

141
00:08:12.041 --> 00:08:14.140
travelers between one territory and another,

142
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.740
well in the end aspects of the foreign culture and society always remain.

143
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.490
And that is what explains why the people of Kaliningrad one of the least pro

144
00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:24.460
Putin and most pro Europe groups in all of Russia.

145
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.713
<v 0>Take a look,</v>

146
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.340
coexistence, dissipates, everything.

147
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.250
As we have mentioned.

148
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:39.910
<v 1>Despite the fact that relations between Europe and Russia collapsed in 2014,</v>

149
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:43.450
the truth is that cleaning grid has a very European flavor and is much more

150
00:08:43.451 --> 00:08:46.690
international. And open-minded then what is difficult in mother Russia?

151
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.710
Here's an example while only 30% of Russians have a passport to travel abroad.

152
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.860
If we focus only on the citizens of Coleen in Gradle blast,

153
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.310
that percentage rises to over 70%.

154
00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.600
This is jus above all to the huge transit of people that has existed since the

155
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:04.890
late 1990s and early two thousands between Colleen and grant and its European

156
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:05.730
union neighbors,

157
00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:10.140
Poland and Lithuania trips that beside tourism have a lot to do with shopping.

158
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.540
If there is one thing that makes Kaliningrad stand out,

159
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:16.080
it is that it is a place where there are not a lot of things to do nor too many

160
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:19.620
interesting products to buy a situation that was further reinforced in 2014,

161
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.040
when president Putin banned the sale of land multitude of Western legally

162
00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:26.850
European and American food stuffs and products in response to sanctions imposed

163
00:09:26.851 --> 00:09:29.400
on Russia over the mess in Ukraine. And as you can imagine,

164
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:33.600
this meant a drastic reduction in the variety and quality of goods available in

165
00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:35.700
Russian supermarkets and shopping centers.

166
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:39.240
So the citizens of cleaning grads who are geographically privileged began to

167
00:09:39.241 --> 00:09:41.310
travel to their neighboring countries so often,

168
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.700
even if it was only to buy Parmesan cheese, come on, bear or ham, the,

169
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:46.830
we can almost say it became their favorite pastime.

170
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:50.630
<v 0>This.</v>

171
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.360
<v 1>This is much more significant than it might seem at first sight.</v>

172
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:54.470
Thanks to all these trips.

173
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.410
Russian citizens have had very close contact with the economic,

174
00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.950
political and social developments that countries such as Poland or Lithuania

175
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.560
have experienced in recent years. For example,

176
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.130
they have witnessed firsthand the enormous wave of prosperity that these

177
00:10:07.131 --> 00:10:08.150
countries have achieved.

178
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.960
It also means that Putin's NTU revision carries less weight here.

179
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.170
The vision of a hostile Europe coming from the official Russian television

180
00:10:15.171 --> 00:10:16.850
channels. It doesn't gel with the Europe ADV.

181
00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.290
<v 2>I traveled to pull in the lots and see how people relate to Russians.</v>

182
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.420
Everything is fine. There are no problems.

183
00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:27.500
The pools are people just like us Alexander office worker from Colin and Greg

184
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.363
for the guardian.

185
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.940
<v 1>Because far from what you might expect in light of everything that we've told</v>

186
00:10:31.941 --> 00:10:32.660
you in this video,

187
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:36.020
the truth is that the Russian government has made the entry of foreigners into

188
00:10:36.021 --> 00:10:37.100
Kaliningrad more or less.

189
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:46.130
One of the latest milestones in this regard was the introduction of the free

190
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:50.930
electronic visa in mid 2019 a visa that can be obtained online just four days

191
00:10:50.931 --> 00:10:52.340
before visiting the territory.

192
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:56.330
This type of visa is available to citizens of 53 countries, including Spain,

193
00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.450
Germany, Lithuania, and Poland. I hope the UK is on that list.

194
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.100
It'd be cool to come and see this place. However,

195
00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:04.550
there is no access for citizens of the United States or South Korea,

196
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.130
but curiously there is for North Korea. Anyway,

197
00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.870
one of Putin's quirks as it stands,

198
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.590
the military tensions between NATO and Russia concerning Kaliningrad does not

199
00:11:12.591 --> 00:11:14.540
seem to have much relevance at street level.

200
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:17.690
This is one of those many occasions in which the troubles of the rulers,

201
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.380
the officials,

202
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.040
and some more than questionable interests are super-imposed on what it should be

203
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:26.810
in reality, a much calmer coexistence in any case. Now it's your turn.

204
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.390
What do you think about a Russian territory full of soldiers,

205
00:11:29.391 --> 00:11:34.070
missiles and warships in the heart of the EU and NATO should Russia and NATO

206
00:11:34.071 --> 00:11:37.280
make more of an effort to understand each other instead of increasing the

207
00:11:37.281 --> 00:11:40.460
military presence more and more, leave your opinion below in the comments.
