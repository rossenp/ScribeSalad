00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.050
<v 0>November 3rd, 2020, the U S elections.</v>

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.350
The controversial era of Donald Trump is coming to an end.

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.330
The time has come to take stock.

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.200
What have been the key takeaways from the administration of the 45th president

5
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.580
of the United States of America?

6
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.613
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.210
<v 0>Difference in this video,</v>

8
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.420
we're going to examine and analyze how Donald Trump's term,

9
00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:35.870
as head of the United States has been. This video is neither for,

10
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.360
nor against president Donald J. Trump.

11
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.080
No many of you will see it and will agree with the results or this will surely

12
00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:45.860
not many of you will think that we have left things out or that we've been too

13
00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:49.640
hard or equally too complimentary. But in all honesty,

14
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.360
I think that what we're going to see is a good approximation of what the Trump

15
00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:57.740
administration has been beyond the marketing scandals and political folk law.

16
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.020
And yes, we have probably left a lot out,

17
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.450
but we have had to select and prioritize.

18
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.270
So I encourage you to let us know in the comments,

19
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.290
if you think there is something missing or left out and to open a debate that

20
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.000
said difference that start with what the 45th president of the United States,

21
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.440
Donald John Trump always considered to be his number one priority. After all,

22
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.170
we are talking about a president who came to the oval office,

23
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.740
boasting of his business management skills. So we have no choice,

24
00:01:24.741 --> 00:01:25.820
but to start exactly.

25
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.630
<v 2>And built the greatest economy in the history of the world.</v>

26
00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:34.100
And now we are very simply, we're doing it again. And we're on track to have,

27
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.530
as I said, the best year we've ever had next year, you just had the best.

28
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.060
<v 1>It's the economy.</v>

29
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.630
<v 0>Election campaigns are the times when politicians sell us all kinds of promises,</v>

30
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.470
less taxes, more vacations, more roads, better democracy,

31
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.860
the best education in the world, better sports facilities, whatever.

32
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.710
In that way, elections become a kind of bizarre,

33
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.150
a Turkish Souk where politicians try to win our votes with grand promises,

34
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.200
Promises as lofty and bombastic in the run-up to the election.

35
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.220
As they usually are insipid. When the elected finally comes to power,

36
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.320
that's something I'm sure. And I mean,

37
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.080
absolutely certain that we're all used to by now.

38
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.800
Let's just say it's part of the show. However, friends in 2016,

39
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.280
Donald Trump went much further. It was an ode to the imagination.

40
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.393
You don't believe me.

41
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.790
<v 1>How about I remind you, just check it out.</v>

42
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.040
<v 0>The 2016 election campaign, Donald Trump really put his foot down.</v>

43
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.710
He said over and over again,

44
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.440
that his arrival in the oval office would mean that for the first time United

45
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.350
States would be run professionally by an experienced businessman.

46
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.540
Something that would obviously have results.

47
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.230
Donald Trump pledged to change the United States forever. For example,

48
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.800
the 45th president promised that he would multiply economic growth to between

49
00:02:54.801 --> 00:02:56.390
four and 6% annually.

50
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.130
Something that he would achieve through deep tax cuts and a new trade policy.

51
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.230
In fact, following the same line,

52
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.220
the president also committed himself to ending the enormous trade deficit.

53
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.910
That according to him was a burden on the us economy and that's not all,

54
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.420
he also gave his word that he would manage to balance the public accounts and

55
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.900
even better that his policies would make it possible to pay off the entire

56
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.040
federal public debt.

57
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.700
That's more than $19 trillion in just eight years with these changes,

58
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.510
the American people would enjoy a prosperity, never seen.

59
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.380
<v 1>But remember.</v>

60
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.850
<v 0>These promises are not ours, but president Trump's of course, four years later,</v>

61
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.840
we can say that what has happened has been very different even without the SARS

62
00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:37.674
coronavirus.

63
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.543
<v 1>Pandemic</v>

64
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.493
beyond all the Mark.

65
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.800
<v 0>Thing that has been poured on Donald Trump's alleged economic miracle.</v>

66
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.790
Perhaps we should be asking what other real numbers that his administration has

67
00:03:50.791 --> 00:03:54.030
achieved. Well, it must be said that the first years were not bad,

68
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.660
but not particularly great either now. I'm sorry, but this is not an opinion.

69
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.210
It's just the numbers. Do you want specific data? Well,

70
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.570
let's take a look during the first three years of the Trump administration

71
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.350
employment growth was lower than the second term of the Obama administration.

72
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.480
Meanwhile, the average economic growth was higher,

73
00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:13.050
but very similar wages also grew more. That's true, but very slightly,

74
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.550
just two tenths of a percent more each year from an average of 1% during the

75
00:04:17.551 --> 00:04:21.990
entire bomber era to one of 1.2% during the Trump era.

76
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.860
And on the flip side,

77
00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:27.450
foreign investment fell in 2019 to its lowest level since 2006

78
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.600
friends take note, because this is important. This scenario,

79
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.280
all these results were also baked in an enormous increase in public spending and

80
00:04:35.281 --> 00:04:38.850
the monetary expansion policy of the federal reserve. Take a look at this chart.

81
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.893
<v 1>For example.</v>

82
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.810
<v 0>The Trump administration in just three budgets,</v>

83
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.860
public spending has skyrocketed not counting coronavirus rescue packages by

84
00:04:49.861 --> 00:04:54.420
around 20%. This represents an annual increase of more than 6%. In other words,

85
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.720
public spending under Trump has grown three times more than the national

86
00:04:57.721 --> 00:05:02.640
economy. And of course, if you also lower your taxes,

87
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.560
what you find is a gaping hole.

88
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.220
And that's exactly what has happened in spite of the economy growing by more

89
00:05:08.221 --> 00:05:11.520
than 2% and the nation being practically in full employment,

90
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.700
the federal public deficit in 2016 was almost

91
00:05:14.701 --> 00:05:19.470
$980 billion. That's 4.5% of the GDP.

92
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.980
And that's not all for this year, even without the coronavirus,

93
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.840
a deficit of almost 5% was projected 5% with the economy growing and operating

94
00:05:27.841 --> 00:05:31.500
at full employment. That's crazy. So imagine where these figures would go in.

95
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.880
I don't know, in a crisis, well, what the heck? It's 2020 and we're already.

96
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.840
<v 1>You know what?</v>

97
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.100
<v 0>The federal government is expected to close 2020 with a public deficit of over</v>

98
00:05:44.101 --> 00:05:47.970
17%. Yes, that's right. 17%. You're not mistaken.

99
00:05:47.971 --> 00:05:52.410
And we haven't misplaced any decimal points, 17%. And this,

100
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.700
this is what explains why the public debt has not only not been repaid,

101
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.340
but has actually skyrocketed

102
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.740
At Donald Trump's first three years at the helm of the country.

103
00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.710
Public debt grew by more than $3 trillion. Yes,

104
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.870
that's trillions with a T of dollars.

105
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.710
If we add that to the impact of the Corona virus by mid 2020,

106
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.100
it had passed the $6 trillion Mark to give you an idea.

107
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.080
This is more than the entire GDP of Japan or practically the total of the GDP of

108
00:06:23.081 --> 00:06:24.010
Germany and France.

109
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.600
<v 1>Reduce our 18 trillion in debt. Because believe me,</v>

110
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.033
we're in a bubble,

111
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.200
we have artificially low interest rates be careful of a bubble.

112
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.790
Cause what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what

113
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.220
happened. So be very, very careful.

114
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.160
<v 0>My friends are the numbers. Of course,</v>

115
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:55.690
these are facts that have been largely camouflaged by what has been a huge

116
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.600
marketing campaign spurred on by statements like this.

117
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.610
<v 1>We made and brought this country to the greatest point in its history.</v>

118
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.960
We never had an economy like we had, we never had numbers like it.

119
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.810
We're going to have them again, Donald Trump.

120
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:13.780
Well.

121
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:17.350
<v 0>By now we all know Trump and his usual relationship with the truth that said his</v>

122
00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:20.890
government did have some significant successes with its economic policy.

123
00:07:20.891 --> 00:07:22.870
During this time there was for example,

124
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.950
the tax cuts and jobs act that's the administration pushed through and managed

125
00:07:26.951 --> 00:07:29.020
to pass at the end of 2017.

126
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.260
The biggest tax reform in 30 years got the biggest tax cut.

127
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:33.633
<v 1>Jake.</v>

128
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.470
<v 0>Are talking about the law. That's largely reduced personal income, taxed,</v>

129
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.220
encouraged tax competition between States and above all reduced corporate income

130
00:07:48.221 --> 00:07:52.330
tax by establishing a kind of flat tax. In addition, this is one of the keys.

131
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:56.530
It changed the scope of this tax, which is no longer worldwide. In other words,

132
00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:00.010
American companies no longer have to pay in full for the profits they make.

133
00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:04.180
For example, in Europe where they have obviously already paid their taxes.

134
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.780
The fact is that these measures allowed for an increase in corporate profits and

135
00:08:07.781 --> 00:08:11.320
therefore boosted the strength of North American companies that competitiveness

136
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.550
and their stock market value.

137
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.700
This is one of the factors that has contributed to the good performance of the

138
00:08:15.701 --> 00:08:18.010
North American stock market over the last few years,

139
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.190
Of course,

140
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:28.600
what Trump forgot as we have already seen was to adjust public spending as well,

141
00:08:28.601 --> 00:08:31.810
and obviously less taxes and more public spending.

142
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.020
It's a combination that is not usually very advisable in any case,

143
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:37.390
this tax reform had a reasonably good impact.

144
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:42.280
<v 1>So this is what we have now. This is where it would work.</v>

145
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:47.170
<v 0>Another area where we can say that Trump has had some success has been in</v>

146
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.530
limiting the expansion of federal regulations. As you can see,

147
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:54.940
as soon as he came to power on January 30th, 2017, president Trump,

148
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:57.510
executive order one, three seven, seven,

149
00:08:57.511 --> 00:09:01.950
one ordering the elimination of two existing regulations for every new

150
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:03.510
regulation that was approved.

151
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:05.670
<v 1>And.</v>

152
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.950
<v 0>Although in the end it didn't work exactly like that.</v>

153
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.140
It is true that during his mandate,

154
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.230
the creation of new federal regulations has been contained.

155
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.920
One way to look at it is to look at the number of pages of the code of federal

156
00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:20.820
regulations that each year codifies existing federal regulations.

157
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:22.920
Well notice how during the last few years,

158
00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:25.950
the number of pages of this code has remained relatively stable.

159
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:29.010
Of course,

160
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:32.790
less regulation is often something that makes life easier for businesses,

161
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.290
especially small businesses.

162
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.200
And it's not that Trump has reduced the number of federal regulations,

163
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.480
but at least they haven't continued to multiply,

164
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:43.050
but it's clear that despite these achievements, there were also great failures,

165
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.500
Greece, for example, the case of the trade war.

166
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:52.010
One of the key policies of this administration in less than three years since

167
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:56.390
its launch in early 2018, Trump has almost turned global trade upside down.

168
00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:00.080
Suddenly he launched into an entire trade war with China and also with allied

169
00:10:00.081 --> 00:10:04.280
countries, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, the European powers, et cetera,

170
00:10:04.281 --> 00:10:06.620
et cetera. And this has been a huge failure,

171
00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:10.670
not only because it undermined their competitiveness of many us companies that

172
00:10:10.671 --> 00:10:13.190
now have had to pay lots of tariffs on their purchases,

173
00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.630
but also because it has not fulfilled its essential purpose to reduce the trade

174
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.100
deficit, which in fact.

175
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.580
<v 1>It's at a maximum October 6th,</v>

176
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:27.020
2020 U S trade deficit jumps to largest and 14 years in August

177
00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:28.453
writers.

178
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.060
<v 0>It's apart from the fact that tariffs are costing American citizens and</v>

179
00:10:32.061 --> 00:10:35.180
businesses tens and tens of billions each year, to give you an idea,

180
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.380
Trump has more than doubled the average tariff on all us exports equivalent to

181
00:10:39.381 --> 00:10:44.180
one of the largest tax increases since 1940 and offsetting much of the 2017 tax

182
00:10:44.181 --> 00:10:47.180
reduction. Yes, president Trump doesn't usually count that,

183
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.790
but the accounts are the accounts and that's not the end of it.

184
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.120
Tariffs have caused other countries to take reciprocal actions. So that,

185
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.840
for example,

186
00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:00.200
the figures of Chinese purchases of products manufactured in the United States

187
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.570
is now lower than before the trade war. Again,

188
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.860
many American companies are facing cumbersome bureaucracy and higher costs while

189
00:11:06.861 --> 00:11:10.370
foreign investment in the United States has plummeted to its lowest level since

190
00:11:10.371 --> 00:11:11.450
2006.

191
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:14.900
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

192
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:19.850
<v 0>Um, a phenomenal success because by the time of the 2020 election in the United</v>

193
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:21.650
States, there were fewer industrial jobs.

194
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.200
And when Trump came to the white house and take notes,

195
00:11:24.201 --> 00:11:25.700
because this is not over yet,

196
00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:34.340
The latest country in the spotlight is Vietnam. On October, the second 2020,

197
00:11:34.341 --> 00:11:37.850
the department of commerce launched an investigation into alleged unfair

198
00:11:37.851 --> 00:11:41.930
competition that may result in new tariffs. And here we go again, by the way,

199
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.020
do you know how the president is fixing many of the messes that have been

200
00:11:45.021 --> 00:11:48.380
created by these policies? Well, by means of subsidies. Yes.

201
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:49.880
That's what I said with substance.

202
00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.000
<v 1>May 23rd, 2019 Trump,</v>

203
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:58.360
his new $16 billion aid package for American farmers hit in trade war,

204
00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:59.830
Washington, post friends.

205
00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.980
<v 0>Do all these results that we've seen so far.</v>

206
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:05.400
We should add the pressure on the federal reserve to devalue the dollar and

207
00:12:05.401 --> 00:12:07.740
increase its policy of hitting the money machine,

208
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.380
which we already talked about in a video that'll link for you.

209
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.850
<v 1>I think the fed is out of control. I think what they're doing is wrong.</v>

210
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:19.170
<v 0>All of the governments abysmal response to the Corona virus pandemic in the end</v>

211
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:23.250
in economic matters, Trump's term in office has had some high points. Yes,

212
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.310
but in general, he leaves the country much more indebted,

213
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.990
more close to global markets.

214
00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:31.920
And now thanks to the effects of the coronavirus with fewer jobs and many more

215
00:12:31.921 --> 00:12:35.910
unemployed. And when he came to power and this light,

216
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:39.570
we can almost say that Trump has been a good example in the United States of

217
00:12:39.571 --> 00:12:44.100
what we would call historical Peronism and Nope, I haven't gone crazy. Not yet.

218
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.910
You have the data and the policies that have been put in place in front of you.

219
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.780
Trump has blown up many historically basic fundamentals of the Republican party,

220
00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:52.860
but friends, of course,

221
00:12:52.861 --> 00:12:57.510
the Trump legislator has not limited itself exclusively to the economic arena.

222
00:12:57.630 --> 00:12:58.463
Listen up.

223
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.720
<v 1>[Inaudible] a world of fists, flags and steel.</v>

224
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:11.670
<v 0>On the question of foreign policy.</v>

225
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:15.510
Trump's mandate has been anything but quiet from poor relations with Western

226
00:13:15.511 --> 00:13:19.770
leaders to surprise and closeness to many or authoritarian leaders or directly

227
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:24.660
objects dictators, such as Kim Jong UN of course Trump's term has broken many,

228
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:25.583
many molds,

229
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:29.250
but this time we will focus exclusively on the many pros and cons of what has

230
00:13:29.251 --> 00:13:33.870
been perhaps the most unpredictable foreign policy in a long time and friends.

231
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:37.230
It starts positively because the first thing we could say is that Trump has

232
00:13:37.231 --> 00:13:41.460
become the first us president, not to declare war since 1980.

233
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.170
And that's definitely a good thing.

234
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:47.880
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

235
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.730
<v 0>But that is not, of course is only achievement.</v>

236
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.900
This administration has achieved milestones as important as the Abraham Accords,

237
00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:58.620
a historic agreement in which the United States played an important role.

238
00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:02.550
And for which the United Arab Emirates has formally recognized the state of

239
00:14:02.551 --> 00:14:05.790
Israel, a recognition, which Bahrain has since made as well,

240
00:14:05.791 --> 00:14:08.490
and which will probably lead to the rest of the Arab countries,

241
00:14:08.491 --> 00:14:12.090
such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia following the same path in the near future,

242
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:16.110
we are talking about the full normalization of relations between Arab countries.

243
00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:17.483
<v 1>Is right.</v>

244
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.410
<v 0>The strength of Trump's foreign policy has been, for example,</v>

245
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.280
the return to the policy of deterrence with Iran following the early 20,

246
00:14:26.281 --> 00:14:30.750
20 execution of general Soleimani, the powerful head of the elite Coots forces.

247
00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:35.490
He was one of the heavyweights of Iran's theoretic regime to Trump's credit are

248
00:14:35.491 --> 00:14:39.840
also the defeat of ISIS with the execution of the leader of the caliphate Abu

249
00:14:39.841 --> 00:14:43.230
Bakr al-Baghdadi or his support for Taiwan. Because my friends,

250
00:14:43.231 --> 00:14:46.710
this administration has been particularly close to this besieged Island that we

251
00:14:46.711 --> 00:14:49.470
covered very recently on visual politic. And finally,

252
00:14:49.471 --> 00:14:53.210
there's the peace agreement in Afghanistan or rather the U S withdrawal because

253
00:14:53.211 --> 00:14:57.260
of the defacto agreement gives the Taliban back all of its influence. Of course,

254
00:14:57.261 --> 00:14:58.730
in this case, to be fair,

255
00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:02.150
it is not clear that there was actually any other possible alternative,

256
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.940
but wait a moment, because along with all these successes,

257
00:15:04.941 --> 00:15:08.720
we also find great failures and among them the most important,

258
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.610
without a doubt has to be China.

259
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:15.880
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

260
00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.170
<v 0>After his arrival in the white house,</v>

261
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:21.220
Donald Trump launched a kind of cold war against the Asian giant and so far,

262
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:22.420
well, he's not winning it.

263
00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:25.300
The Chinese government of judging ping is spreading its tentacles,

264
00:15:25.301 --> 00:15:26.740
like never before Africa,

265
00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:30.670
central Asia and even countries of the former Yugoslavia are examples of

266
00:15:30.671 --> 00:15:34.360
territories where China's influence is even more significant than that of the

267
00:15:34.361 --> 00:15:36.100
United States. And not only that,

268
00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:40.270
the modernization of the people's liberation army has made the entire East Asian

269
00:15:40.271 --> 00:15:44.710
region red hot To make matters. Worse.

270
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.930
XE Jingping has debts to put a defacto,

271
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.150
enter the regime of freedom in Hong Kong,

272
00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.730
without Washington being able to do anything about it.

273
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:55.600
It's a far cry from Ronald Reagan's tear down this wall in West Berlin.

274
00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:59.710
<v 1>Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall.</v>

275
00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:05.650
<v 0>Instead we have moved onto the most absolute inaction in the case of Hong Kong,</v>

276
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:09.040
which until now was one of the freest places on earth.

277
00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.990
Asia may seem far away to us,

278
00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.110
but think about what this means in what is already demographically and

279
00:16:14.111 --> 00:16:17.200
economically the most important region in the world. Friends,

280
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:20.890
this inaction was partly due to the fact that all the cartridges had already

281
00:16:20.891 --> 00:16:22.420
been spent in the trade war.

282
00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:26.410
So now the free world is left with tariffs without Hong Kong. And with China,

283
00:16:26.411 --> 00:16:27.820
that is more expansionist.

284
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:31.780
<v 1>Then ever. What was the name of that book that he wrote? You know,</v>

285
00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.430
the art of the deal.

286
00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:42.040
<v 0>With respect to such delicate issues as North Korea, Ukraine, or Venezuela,</v>

287
00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:45.250
the administration's achievements have been practically nil. In fact,

288
00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:49.090
we now know that we will have to get used to the idea of a permanently nuclear

289
00:16:49.091 --> 00:16:53.830
North Korea. And if we add to all of this,

290
00:16:53.831 --> 00:16:56.560
the strained relations with many of the historical allies,

291
00:16:56.561 --> 00:16:58.180
the president's trade policy,

292
00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.480
which brought the United States out of the biggest free trade agreement in

293
00:17:01.481 --> 00:17:03.130
history, something that Gigi ping,

294
00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.770
Shirley celebrated Trump's portrayal of the Kurtz,

295
00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:10.450
his role in feeding the confrontations with Qatar or his inability to hold Saudi

296
00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.020
Arabia accountable for the murder of Washington post journalist and columnist,

297
00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:18.100
Jamal Khashoggi. What we have is a real mixture of hits and misses.

298
00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:23.450
<v 1>On the one hand.</v>

299
00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:26.890
<v 0>The agreement between Israel and the Arab countries has been a historical event.</v>

300
00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:30.490
And the fact that the United States is involved in fewer Wars is undoubtedly

301
00:17:30.491 --> 00:17:33.310
good news for the United States. But on the other hand,

302
00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:37.270
Trump leaves us with a less open world with a new cold war,

303
00:17:37.271 --> 00:17:38.440
potentially underweight,

304
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:42.220
for which we may be under prepared and many tyrants running around with a sense

305
00:17:42.221 --> 00:17:45.100
of total impunity. Those are the dark sides, okay.

306
00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.173
<v 1>He's legacy</v>

307
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:57.690
from the wall to justice and a pandemic well.

308
00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:00.050
<v 0>Internal policy level. We could say many things,</v>

309
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.710
but I think there are three issues that stand out in their own right immigration

310
00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:08.210
justice and the Corona virus. As far as this healthcare reform plan goes well,

311
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.010
that's to say, it's neither here nor there,

312
00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.170
despite all the times it's been promised friends.

313
00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.490
If Trump has had one obsession,

314
00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.880
it has been the border wall and reducing immigration, all members.

315
00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.193
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

316
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.780
<v 0>The one hand, the war has been a huge failure.</v>

317
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.300
Trump promised it both actively and passively,

318
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.270
but four years later there has been hardly any progress. In fact,

319
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:33.770
despite all the efforts only 480 kilometers of war has been built of which

320
00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:37.160
420 kilometers by the way are not new construction,

321
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:41.360
but rather repairs to existing structures. In other words, the Trump wall,

322
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:46.040
the new Trump wall after four years of promises amounts to a 60 kilometer

323
00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:50.480
extension along the border of more than 3000 kilometers. And of course,

324
00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.130
Mexico has not paid a single.

325
00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:55.220
<v 1>Of course.</v>

326
00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.680
<v 0>That hasn't been their only policy on immigration</v>

327
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.180
Since taking office.

328
00:19:02.181 --> 00:19:06.290
The Trump administration has taken over 400 executive actions on immigration.

329
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:09.470
His obsession has even extended to H one B visas,

330
00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.590
which are grantees to high-level professionals, such as mathematicians,

331
00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:15.650
computer scientists and engineers. Since Trump came to power,

332
00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.390
the percentage of rejected applications.

333
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:22.850
<v 1>Triple top CEO's denounced Trump immigration policy is threats to U S</v>

334
00:19:22.851 --> 00:19:24.320
economy. The New York times.

335
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.830
<v 0>We are talking about highly qualified professionals who are key to the</v>

336
00:19:27.831 --> 00:19:29.630
competitiveness of American companies.

337
00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.380
And this is certainly one of the reasons why support for Biden is so high in

338
00:19:33.381 --> 00:19:34.130
Silicon Valley.

339
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.010
Perhaps the only thing his administration has achieved in the area of

340
00:19:37.011 --> 00:19:41.570
immigration is that Mexico has stopped a good deal of the migratory flows from

341
00:19:41.571 --> 00:19:43.850
central America that had made him so unhappy.

342
00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.713
<v 1>Comfortable.</v>

343
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.270
<v 0>On the other hand, where he has reaped,</v>

344
00:19:50.271 --> 00:19:53.780
great triumphs has been in the area of justice in 2018.

345
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:58.430
And after a bipartisan agreement, he signs the first step act, a law that is,

346
00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.780
and as its name indicates a first step towards reforming the judicial system and

347
00:20:02.781 --> 00:20:06.410
giving a greater role to rehabilitation and reinsertion policies.

348
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:09.800
He has also succeeded in placing thanks to the Republican majority in the

349
00:20:09.801 --> 00:20:13.100
Senate, three conservative judges on the Supreme court,

350
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:16.020
which presumably guarantees a conservative majority for me.

351
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:16.963
<v 1>Yes.</v>

352
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:23.150
<v 0>This has enormous influence on us policy. And finally, the failure,</v>

353
00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.350
the great thing.

354
00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:25.573
<v 1>Galia.</v>

355
00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.290
<v 0>Perhaps my friends,</v>

356
00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:34.070
the greatest failure of his entire presidential term has been the way in which

357
00:20:34.071 --> 00:20:38.060
this administration has dealt with the pandemic as evidenced in recordings with

358
00:20:38.061 --> 00:20:40.880
Bob Woodward. Trump knew very early what we were up against,

359
00:20:40.881 --> 00:20:43.640
but he didn't do anything. Well, not only did he not do anything,

360
00:20:43.641 --> 00:20:47.350
but he tried to downplay the seriousness of it and that my friends has come a

361
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.930
very high cost to American society, more than

362
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.380
235,000 deaths at the time of making this video,

363
00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.300
we've barely 4% of the world's population.

364
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:59.050
The United States accounts for around 20% of all recorded deaths.

365
00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:02.050
And of course a huge economic crisis.

366
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:07.710
Well friends, we may have left out many things,

367
00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.890
including impeachment proceedings, but what we have selected,

368
00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:15.360
we believe to be the main markers of the Trump era with its high points and its

369
00:21:15.361 --> 00:21:16.110
low points.

370
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:20.460
What seems clear in any case is that the supposed economic miracle promoted by

371
00:21:20.461 --> 00:21:22.320
the president simply never existed.

372
00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:24.390
The time has come to ask whether so much tension,

373
00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:27.510
so many confrontations and so many threats have been worthwhile,

374
00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.690
but now it's your turn. What do you think of the Trump era so far?

375

What do you think we have failed to comment on leave us your response in the
