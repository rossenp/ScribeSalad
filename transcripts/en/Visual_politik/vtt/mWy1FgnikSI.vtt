So far in 2020,

5
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.380
multiple events have brought this kind of confrontation to the field of economy

6
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.190
and big finance. You don't have to look far to see news stories like this.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.520
President Trump has even gone so far as to mention a possible financial

19
00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:07.880
disconnection. If Beijing does not agree to change its rules of the game,

20
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.040
Just about the white house on the 21st of April,

21
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.870
the securities and exchange commission,

22
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.800
the body responsible for regulating the stock markets issued an alert,

23
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.070
a warning about the risks involved in investing in emerging markets,

24
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.910
especially in China because of the regulatory deficiencies that exist.

25
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.940
<v 2>Emerging market investments entail significant disclosure, financial reporting,</v>

26
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.290
and other risks remedies are limited as a result in many emerging markets,

27
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.220
including China,

28
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.060
there is substantially greater risk that disclosures will be incomplete or

29
00:01:41.061 --> 00:01:42.530
misleading. Sec.

30
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.630
<v 0>Then.</v>

31
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.790
<v 1>Shortly afterwards, in the same vein,</v>

32
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.810
the United States Senate approved the holding foreign companies accountable act

33
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.470
by a large bipartisan majority on 20th of May, 2020.

34
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.840
It's a law that States in a cautious manner.

35
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.410
They're Chinese companies listed in the United States that do not comply with

36
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:02.810
the requirements of the accounting oversight board.

37
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.830
For us listed companies will be expelled from U S markets. Yes,

38
00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:08.330
that's what I said. Expelled.

39
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.670
<v 3>If Chinese based companies want to be listed on the stock exchange or access to</v>

40
00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:18.200
the U S capital markets, we must make them comply with us laws. If they do not,

41
00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:22.910
we must remove Chinese base companies from us, stock exchanges, mucker, Rubio,

42
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.380
Republican Senator from Florida.

43
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.820
<v 1>In other words,</v>

44
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.150
if things do not change this law could ultimately lead to American stock

45
00:02:29.151 --> 00:02:33.980
exchanges, expelling Chinese giants like Baidu, a Google style search engine,

46
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.270
or even Alibaba.

47
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.940
<v 0>Because.</v>

48
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.080
<v 1>You see the law introduced by Republican Senator John Kenneth and Democrat.</v>

49
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.130
Chris van Hollen requires that Chinese companies listed in the United States

50
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.330
certify that they are not under the control of the Chinese government and comply

51
00:02:50.331 --> 00:02:53.030
with the supervisory standards that are customary in the country,

52
00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:55.670
because the truth is that until now such bodies,

53
00:02:55.671 --> 00:02:59.980
such as the sec or the accounting oversight board have not been able to access

54
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:03.400
the accounting and audit work on these companies simply because the Chinese

55
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:04.750
government does not allow it.

56
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.050
Beijing considers this kind of material to be state secrets.

57
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.800
This means that supervision and scrutiny of Chinese companies has so far been

58
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:15.820
much weaker, even if they were listed on United States, stock exchanges.

59
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.980
<v 0>And there's even.</v>

60
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.730
<v 1>More agencies such as the federal retirement savings investment board,</v>

61
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:25.210
which manages the retirement savings of governments and military employees.

62
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.980
We're talking about around $600 billion have decided to freeze their plans to

63
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:30.820
invest in Chinese.

64
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.653
<v 0>Stocks.</v>

65
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.150
<v 2>May 13th, 2020 federal retirement fund.</v>

66
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.810
Holt's planned China investment under pressure and Y times.

67
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.710
<v 1>However, let's not fool ourselves. In spite of everything,</v>

68
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.150
it is clear that the man of Chinese market is a tasty and appealing carrot,

69
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.020
not only for the big multinationals, but also for investors all over the world.

70
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.020
China carries increasing weight in the world economy.

71
00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.470
That is why in this new installment of the series we are doing in collaboration

72
00:03:58.471 --> 00:04:01.230
with value school, we are asking the following questions,

73
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.920
how much influence does the Asian giants really have in the boat of finance?

74
00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.730
Why are us regulators alerting us to the risks of investing in Chinese

75
00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:13.290
companies? How could those risks affect world finance? What are these risks?

76
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.270
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

77
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.430
<v 1>In this video, we want to answer all these questions.</v>

78
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.390
And we are also going to give you many details about some of the latest cases of

79
00:04:27.391 --> 00:04:31.560
extensive fraud committed by Chinese companies. Some of which by the way,

80
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.540
are even listed in the United States stocks.

81
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.410
These are fraud cases consisting of a systematic falsification of company

82
00:04:40.411 --> 00:04:43.440
accounts to build up an image that had nothing to do with reality.

83
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.900
Have you heard, for example, of Luckin coffee,

84
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.140
the great Chinese company that was to rival Starbucks? Well.

85
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.333
<v 0>Let's get into it.</v>

86
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.540
<v 2>He's Chinese and more Chinese.</v>

87
00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.060
<v 1>Everybody. Everybody wants a piece of China. We're talking about a huge market,</v>

88
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.400
almost 1.4 billion consumers,

89
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.600
a middle class of over 600 million people and a purchasing power that just grows

90
00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:11.100
and grows and grows. China is a huge opportunity to make billions in profits.

91
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.910
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

92
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.570
<v 1>Now the question we can ask ourselves is from the point of view of financial</v>

93
00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:20.970
economics, how exactly are things going? Well,

94
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.270
the truth is that despite all the drums of war that we've been hearing lately,

95
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.970
things aren't going badly at all in 2019,

96
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.510
Chinese regulators began to relax many of the restrictions that prevented

97
00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:34.290
foreign players from participating in the financial industry. And since then,

98
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.410
well, let's just say that the sector has been a veritable party,

99
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.610
a nonstop party,

100
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.630
check it out between 2019 and 2020.

101
00:05:42.631 --> 00:05:46.110
We have seen PayPal acquire 70% of the Chinese company.

102
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.800
GoPay thus becoming the first foreign company to provide online payment

103
00:05:49.801 --> 00:05:50.940
services. In China.

104
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.840
We have seen Goldman Sachs take a majority stake in the securities firm with

105
00:05:54.841 --> 00:05:58.280
which it operated in this country. Exactly the thing Morgan Stanley did,

106
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.930
then JP Morgan has started to operate a futures company with 100% foreign

107
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:06.890
capital and American express has received approval to become the first foreign

108
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:10.280
credit card company to launch land-based operations in China,

109
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.040
visa and MasterCard are now following in the same path.

110
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.750
Even the rating agencies,

111
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.650
SNP and Fitch have been approved to perform credit rating services in the

112
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:23.330
country and dear friends of visual politics. These are just a few examples,

113
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.290
despite the constant rumblings of eminent war China's financial integration has

114
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:30.800
accelerated over the past two years. And if we think about it for a moment,

115
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.780
it's nothing unusable China's potential market is so huge that international

116
00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:39.410
companies could make billions in profits by taking even a small share of it.

117
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.500
But it is not just the financial services industry.

118
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.150
The truth is that capital flows,

119
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.670
especially those known as portfolio of investment,

120
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:51.170
that is financial investment flows that do not involve taking control of a

121
00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:55.460
company such as minority shareholdings or the purchase of debt securities are

122
00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:57.080
growing substantially year by year.

123
00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.233
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

124
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.440
<v 1>You can see from this graph, by the end of Q1,</v>

125
00:07:02.441 --> 00:07:07.240
2020 foreign investor ownership of Chinese stocks and bonds exceeded 4 trillion

126
00:07:07.241 --> 00:07:09.190
Yuan, about $600 billion,

127
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.480
a number that is expected to grow very strongly over the next few years,

128
00:07:13.481 --> 00:07:15.970
as large companies that produce the best known indices,

129
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.410
such as MSEI are gradually increasing the weight of Chinese listed companies in

130
00:07:20.411 --> 00:07:21.880
their indices. Let's take a look.

131
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.810
MSEI increases weighting of China,

132
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.880
Asia shares in indexes to 20% rich, all things considered.

133
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.270
It makes a lot of sense because the Chinese capital markets is getting bigger.

134
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.100
For example, take a look at this other group.

135
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:40.720
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

136
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.351
<v 1>As you can see,</v>

137
00:07:41.351 --> 00:07:45.070
the Chinese stock exchanges are already the second largest in the world in terms

138
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.880
of the market value of their listed companies. And yes. Okay. You got me.

139
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:49.480
It's true.

140
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.230
Although this chart prepared by asset manager Alliance Bernstein includes the

141
00:07:53.231 --> 00:07:56.620
Hong Kong stock exchange. The truth is that if we exclude that data,

142
00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.000
the chart wouldn't change much.

143
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.720
And obviously that means that more and more international investors are going to

144
00:08:01.721 --> 00:08:04.630
set their sights on the Asian giants capital markets.

145
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.650
After all it is precisely here that many business opportunities are emerging as

146
00:08:08.651 --> 00:08:13.210
well as many of the new unicorns. And that's not the end of it.

147
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.960
Then we also have to take into account that there are almost 230 Chinese

148
00:08:16.961 --> 00:08:19.900
companies listed on the NASDAQ and the New York stock exchange.

149
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.360
We're talking about companies like Alibaba, Neo,

150
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:26.500
or Baidu known as the Chinese versions of Amazon Tesla and Google

151
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.040
retrospectively. In other words, the Asian giant is not only,

152
00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:32.860
only present in industrial and commercial markets,

153
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.410
but it's also increasingly present in the financial world.

154
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.990
And it doesn't really seem like that's something that can be reversed,

155
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.930
but so what, why so many warnings and misgivings,

156
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.590
why has the U S given the green lights to a bill that could end up driving many

157
00:08:44.591 --> 00:08:46.990
Chinese companies out of the us stock exchanges?

158
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.680
Why so many sec warnings about the risk of investing in the Chinese capital

159
00:08:50.681 --> 00:08:53.200
markets? Well, let's take a closer look.

160
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.460
<v 0>A rampage announced.</v>

161
00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:58.820
<v 1>It is clear.</v>

162
00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.780
Events have shown us very clearly that both the corporate governance and the

163
00:09:02.781 --> 00:09:06.500
legal system in China are weak in preventing and dealing with all kinds of

164
00:09:06.501 --> 00:09:07.850
corporate fraud. And that,

165
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:11.450
that has meant that fraud and accounting manipulation scandals in Chinese

166
00:09:11.451 --> 00:09:13.760
companies are not something strange.

167
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:17.720
The latest big scandal occurred in the company known as the Chinese Starbucks.

168
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:18.830
Have you heard of login coffee?

169
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:23.690
Well pay attention because the story is not to be missed lucky and coffee.

170
00:09:23.691 --> 00:09:28.310
It was launched in 2017 with one objective to popularize coffee consumption in a

171
00:09:28.311 --> 00:09:32.390
country where this product is still very unpopular to give you an idea in 2018,

172
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:36.680
the annual per capita consumption of coffee in China was only six cups compared

173
00:09:36.681 --> 00:09:41.090
to more than 200 in Taiwan and almost 400 in the United States. However,

174
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:45.410
Lukkin had a plan to offer cheaper coffee through stores in busy places to

175
00:09:45.411 --> 00:09:48.860
achieve this. They developed an application to order and pay for orders,

176
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.130
which would allow the company to reduce labor costs on the one hand and on the

177
00:09:52.131 --> 00:09:55.250
other to continually send customers new offers, gifts,

178
00:09:55.251 --> 00:09:58.790
and discounts so that they would come back again and again and again,

179
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.670
and take notes because just one year after its inception,

180
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.600
this company received a significant capital injection from joy capital,

181
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.520
the largest venture capital fund in China,

182
00:10:07.521 --> 00:10:09.740
and also from Singapore sovereign wealth fund,

183
00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:14.300
the operation value to this startup at $1 billion with a new capital lucky and

184
00:10:14.301 --> 00:10:16.700
began to grow at full speed. In just two years,

185
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:21.590
it opened more than 4,500 stores throughout China on may 17, 2019.

186
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.790
It's made its debut on the NASDAQ. Come on.

187
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.380
This company seems to have it all.

188
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:31.220
It was growing at full speed rather than Starbucks in the Chinese market.

189
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.800
And it had an app, an app. And do you know what that means?

190
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.930
Even though it was just a company that sold coffee,

191
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.020
it suddenly became a fully fledged technology company.

192
00:10:39.021 --> 00:10:42.950
And so this is how it stock market debut became a huge success.

193
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:47.330
After the opening bell was rung lock-in shares jumped almost 50% from the

194
00:10:47.331 --> 00:10:49.520
initial offer price. And in the following eight months,

195
00:10:49.521 --> 00:10:53.240
the share price practically multiplied by three friends expectations for this

196
00:10:53.241 --> 00:10:55.040
company were sky high.

197
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:59.900
<v 2>November 13th, 2019 in sales top forecast,</v>

198
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.970
as it chases Starbucks in China.

199
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.080
<v 4>December 2nd, 2019.</v>

200
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:09.950
<v 2>China's Luckin coffee matching Starbucks at its own game logins.</v>

201
00:11:09.951 --> 00:11:14.510
Digital focus is shining according to one analyst that poses a particular threat

202
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:19.460
to Starbucks is China business. Jan, 17 of 2020.

203
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.130
This coffee upstart could be a stronger growth stock.

204
00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.310
Then Starbucks in the near term says Gina Sanchez,

205
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.300
founder and CEO of investment consulting firm Chante co global.

206
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.550
<v 1>At the end of January, 2020, the scandal broke muddy waters research.</v>

207
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:38.510
A private investment firms specializing in short sale was published an 89 page

208
00:11:38.511 --> 00:11:42.350
report. Apparently showing how this company Luckin coffee was systematically

209
00:11:42.351 --> 00:11:45.590
misrepresenting its financial statements, especially its turnover.

210
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.970
The report stated for example,

211
00:11:46.971 --> 00:11:49.340
that the so-called Chinese Starbucks was inflating.

212
00:11:49.341 --> 00:11:52.370
The number of products sold by 60 to 88%.

213
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.060
Each the company initially denied it.

214
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:59.260
But finally on April 2nd had to admit that all the accusations were true.

215
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.370
Of course, as you can imagine,

216
00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:04.480
the stock price automatically plummeted between February and the end of June.

217
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.880
When the NASDAQ expelled this company from their market,

218
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.550
it shares lost 95% of them.

219
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:20.250
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

220
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.530
<v 3>They were aggressive and expanded very quickly either.</v>

221
00:12:22.531 --> 00:12:25.220
They got people to drink coffee and they would make a lot of money or it

222
00:12:25.221 --> 00:12:29.130
wouldn't work when big or fail fast, a very reasonable strategy. However,

223
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.260
when I visited their stores, they were empty.

224
00:12:31.261 --> 00:12:34.560
There were simply no customers while Starbucks across the street were full

225
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.160
Jeffrey Towson professor of the MBA program at Peking university.

226
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:43.050
<v 1>That the lucky and coffee case was no exception. Over the last few years,</v>

227
00:12:43.051 --> 00:12:47.910
scandals involving Chinese companies have been frequent as of 2022 other Chinese

228
00:12:47.911 --> 00:12:50.670
companies listed in the United States, the online training company,

229
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.700
talent education group under the streaming video platform,

230
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.200
Ikea have been linked to or admitted to alleged fraud. And in large part,

231
00:12:58.201 --> 00:13:01.890
this is what explains both the sec warnings and the new legislation passed by

232
00:13:01.891 --> 00:13:05.100
the Senate. So the question we can now ask ourselves is what now,

233
00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:06.780
what consequences can we expect? Okay,

234
00:13:06.781 --> 00:13:10.380
let's take a look on Kong style.

235
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:15.660
New legislation passed by the United States Senate and the growing hostility of

236
00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:19.170
the Trump administration has set off alarm bells in many Chinese companies.

237
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:23.250
The most likely scenario is that eventually China will give in on this issue and

238
00:13:23.251 --> 00:13:27.120
it will strengthen its control over corporate governance and allow us regulators

239
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.900
access to the accounting and audit working documents of Chinese companies.

240
00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:31.740
But of course,

241
00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:35.670
we're talking about a probable scenario or to certain one relations between

242
00:13:35.671 --> 00:13:38.790
Washington DC and Beijing are becoming increasingly tense.

243
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:43.920
So the affected companies are putting contingency plans in place that basically

244
00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.650
involve preparing for a listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange.

245
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.480
This is a path that has already been taken by companies such as Alibaba,

246
00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:55.230
jd.com and the video game company net ease among others.

247
00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:59.370
Then for its part China's largest semiconductor company for semiconductor

248
00:13:59.371 --> 00:14:00.090
manufacturing,

249
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:03.840
international corporation even left the New York stock exchange and is now

250
00:14:03.841 --> 00:14:05.160
listed only in.

251
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.560
<v 0>Hong Kong in total.</v>

252
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.720
<v 1>According to the investment bank, UBS,</v>

253
00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.530
at least 42 companies listed in the United States now have plans to start

254
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:15.930
trading in Hong Kong as a preventative measure.

255
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.690
And that's not all in the face of so much uncertainty.

256
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.890
It seems that Chinese companies that want to go public are thinking very hard

257
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.140
about whether to use American markets at all.

258
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.930
The most famous case is undoubtedly that one of the,

259
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:33.270
the most valuable unicorn in the world friends group is a financial technology

260
00:14:33.271 --> 00:14:35.340
company associated with Alibaba,

261
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:39.240
which is also one of its largest shareholders and which among other assets

262
00:14:39.241 --> 00:14:40.074
controls.

263
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:44.250
Ali-pay the dominant mobile payment platform in China with more than 500 million

264
00:14:44.251 --> 00:14:46.650
users, to give you an idea of what we are talking about.

265
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.510
According to existing estimates,

266
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:52.700
it could go public with a valuation of approximately hundred billion dollars and

267
00:14:52.701 --> 00:14:53.090
friends.

268
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.780
We're talking about a giant that from what we can gather has decided to discard

269
00:14:56.781 --> 00:15:00.350
the United States for now and has opted to go forward with listings only on

270
00:15:00.351 --> 00:15:02.660
Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges.

271
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.640
<v 0>Well.</v>

272
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.630
<v 1>That's the way it seems.</v>

273
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:09.080
Although China's financial ties with the rest of the world are steadily growing.

274
00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.720
Everything points to the fact that in the near future,

275
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.580
as far as Chinese companies are concerned,

276
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.730
we will see Hong Kong playing a greater role than that of American stock

277
00:15:16.731 --> 00:15:17.630
exchanges. Yes,

278
00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:21.560
it's the financial center of Hong Kong that may benefit most from this new clash

279
00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.990
between China and the United States. In fact,

280
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:26.090
in an upcoming video here on visual politics,

281
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.270
we will tell you how important Hong Kong remains for China.

282
00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.520
And for the time being until things change,

283
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:35.300
you have to be aware of the additional risks that can come with investing in

284
00:15:35.301 --> 00:15:36.860
Chinese companies. In fact,

285
00:15:36.861 --> 00:15:40.760
this is one of the reasons why these companies are often quoted, for example,

286
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:43.610
lower P E R levels than their Western counterpart.

287
00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:47.411
With this video,

288
00:15:47.411 --> 00:15:51.010
we wanted to bring you closer to the growing role that China has in world

289
00:15:51.011 --> 00:15:54.940
finance and the risks that this poses risks that we can never lose sight of if

290
00:15:54.941 --> 00:15:58.600
we're talking about investment. But the question is as an investor,

291
00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:01.630
what do you think of Chinese companies? Do you consider them,

292
00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.760
do you think they are worth the risk or not

293
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:12.670
