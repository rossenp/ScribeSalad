00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.470
<v 1>The health crisis unleashed by the coronavirus as led to an unprecedented</v>

2
00:00:12.471 --> 00:00:15.980
situation for the first time, multiple offices, factories, cities,

3
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.350
and virtually entire countries have closed

4
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.470
During the first half of 2020, we have faced an unimaginable scenario.

5
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.540
Think about it for a minute. If in December,

6
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.460
someone had told us that during this year,

7
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.120
we would see the collapse of the aviation sector, the collapse of oil prices,

8
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.860
the wide-scale closure of factories,

9
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.130
or the multiple declarations of States of alarm and States of exception

10
00:00:40.131 --> 00:00:43.400
throughout the world. We would have said something like, come on, come on.

11
00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:44.210
Where's the hidden.

12
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.043
<v 0>Camera.</v>

13
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.920
<v 1>As has happened so many other times before reality ends up being stranger than</v>

14
00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:52.400
fiction.

15
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.790
Of course we don't yet know the full extent of the economic crisis that may

16
00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:58.850
occur closing the doors of entire countries. Doesn't exactly come cheap,

17
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.130
Right? To prevent things from getting out of hand,

18
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.820
virtually every government in the world is approving plans of all kinds.

19
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.330
If you only consider the approved stimulus in public spending loans and

20
00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:12.890
interventions by central banks,

21
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.350
the bill already amounts to trillions of dollars.

22
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.070
<v 0>Trillion dollars.</v>

23
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.660
So you're talking about a $6.2 trillion bill.

24
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.520
This is about all of us,

25
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.180
and it is way bigger than any of us.

26
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.910
This is Europe's moment.

27
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.440
We have been conducting purchases under our new endemic

28
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.050
emergency purchase program,

29
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.780
which has an overall envelope of 750 billion

30
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.733
euros.

31
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.280
<v 2>The European central bank pulls out its bazooka and bricks.</v>

32
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.410
All asset purchase records in a week,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.240
the Senate unanimously approves the largest economic bailout and us history of

00:01:56.241 --> 00:02:00.980
$2.2 trillion to deal with the coronavirus LPs European

35
00:02:00.981 --> 00:02:05.480
commission proposes recovery plan of 750 billion euros. El Mundo.

36
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.590
<v 1>Right at this point is when many economists scientists and politicians and</v>

37
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.150
entrepreneurs have put forward a very particular idea why not take advantage of

38
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.540
all these plans to drive new non-polluting technologies?

39
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.100
Have you heard of green recovery,

40
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.580
Or this has made us ask ourselves a question at visual politics.

41
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.200
Does this really make sense?

42
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.130
Can governments boost economic activity while making a big leap towards a

43
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.090
greener economy? What did this plan end up being profitable

44
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.230
And friends? One important detail?

45
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.500
It doesn't matter if you care more or less about climate change,

46
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.010
or if you consider it more or less dangerous because I'm sure everyone,

47
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.310
absolutely. All of us wants a cleaner world, a greener world,

48
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.980
one in which we are more considerate of other creatures,

49
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.060
and that is much less polluted. And if on the way to achieving this end goal,

50
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.650
we also managed to boost prosperity, the number of jobs and economic growth,

51
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.110
then who on earth is not going to stand for this year.

52
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.353
<v 0>Age.</v>

53
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.110
<v 1>In order to achieve this, we have to keep a few things very clear.</v>

54
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.500
The fight against pollution will only be possible if we can make it profitable

55
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.310
and make no mistake.

56
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.310
Having to be economically profitable is a noble goal as well.

57
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.910
It means achieving a better world while allowing people to live better to of

58
00:03:23.911 --> 00:03:26.040
course, the question is, is this actually possible.

59
00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.450
<v 0>A different recovery today?</v>

60
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.800
<v 1>European union is the institution that is investing the most resources in combat</v>

61
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.753
in class.

62
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.000
The so-called European green patch was introduced in December, 2019,

63
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.840
an action plan that aims to make Europe the first carbon neutral continent by

64
00:03:51.841 --> 00:03:54.330
2050, that is in net terms.

65
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.710
It will not emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that eventually European

66
00:03:58.711 --> 00:04:03.450
emissions are lower than the CO2 that is withdrawn naturally from it by plants.

67
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.060
Of course it is not an easy task and it's not cheap.

68
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.720
The European commission itself has estimated the investment needed to achieve

69
00:04:09.721 --> 00:04:13.050
that objective at more than 250 billion euros per year.

70
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.380
Something like the complete GDP of Finland or the Czech Republic.

71
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.410
<v 0>Okay.</v>

72
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.390
<v 1>Now, after the coronavirus crisis,</v>

73
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.140
the European commission wants to speed things up on the 27th of May commission,

74
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.100
president Ursula Vonda land presented a fund for economic reconstruction,

75
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.560
totaling 750 billion euros.

76
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.380
That's just over $830 billion.

77
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.610
<v 3>The commission is today proposing a new recovery instrument called next</v>

78
00:04:41.611 --> 00:04:45.870
generation issue worth 750 billion Euro.

79
00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.090
<v 1>Which had been set aside for the commission's political priorities,</v>

80
00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.970
but most important among them, the European green pact,

81
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.880
that is the fight against climate change. In this way,

82
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.050
the European commission joins a strategy known as.

83
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.353
<v 0>Screen recovery.</v>

84
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.090
<v 1>And in this video,</v>

85
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.940
we are not going to discuss the conditions plan because it still lacks many

86
00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:07.530
details. And besides, well,

87
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.770
you know what these kinds of plans tend to rely too much on regulations,

88
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.200
public spending and the capacity of bureaucrats.

89
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.340
So beyond how the European plan might work this time here on visual politics,

90
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.090
we will take a close look at a few examples in this whole green recovery

91
00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:24.390
adventure and how it could make sense depending on the approach to use.

92
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.583
<v 0>Well.</v>

93
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.120
<v 1>The first thing is to be clear,</v>

94
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.320
very clear about the three key objectives that these kinds of strategies have to

95
00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:37.950
follow. First. They need to improve the efficiency with which we use energy.

96
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.760
Second. They have to be able to drive cleaner ways to produce that energy.

97
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.330
That means not only in the richest countries, but also in developing countries.

98
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.990
And third,

99
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.170
they have to encourage the development of new technologies that allow us to

100
00:05:49.171 --> 00:05:52.470
achieve the challenge of becoming carbon neutral or what was being cost

101
00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.540
effective and contributing to the improvement.

102
00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.530
<v 0>Well.</v>

103
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.050
<v 1>With these ideas, clearly in mind, let's start this journey.</v>

104
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.580
Do you want to see in a concrete way,

105
00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.940
how green recovery can contribute to the economic recovery? Well,

106
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.013
let's get stuck.

107
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.590
<v 0>Little big changes.</v>

108
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.990
<v 1>The first thing we can do is take a look at our cities.</v>

109
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.400
You see, when we think of carbon dioxide emissions,

110
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.750
we usually imagine huge factories with large chimneys pouring out lots of smoke

111
00:06:28.751 --> 00:06:30.820
morning, afternoon, and night. However,

112
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.540
according to data from the European union and the United nations environment

113
00:06:34.541 --> 00:06:35.050
program,

114
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.800
the building's taken into account the construction maintenance and above all the

115
00:06:38.801 --> 00:06:43.090
energy and electricity they consume they account for almost 40%. Yes,

116
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.940
40% of all carbon dioxide emissions in the.

117
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.773
<v 0>World.</v>

118
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.020
<v 1>Surprised well friends,</v>

119
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.840
let's take a look at one of the most iconic buildings on the planet.

120
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.880
The most famous skyscraper in New York city.

121
00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.853
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

122
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.130
<v 1>2009.</v>

123
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.670
The owners of the empire state building decided to carry out a comprehensive

124
00:07:03.671 --> 00:07:06.910
reform to reduce the energy consumption of this old giant,

125
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.920
a reform that was done. And this is important,

126
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.220
not only with the aim of reducing its carbon footprint, but also,

127
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.040
and perhaps above all to reduce electricity and heating.

128
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:18.880
<v 0>It turns out.</v>

129
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.870
<v 1>This reform consisted of things as spectacular as changing the window panes to</v>

130
00:07:22.871 --> 00:07:24.670
special ones with greater installation,

131
00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.400
changing the lights of the arcade to led lights,

132
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.830
putting reflective barriers behind the radiators,

133
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.280
assembling a shutter management system and installing motors in the lifts that

134
00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.200
allow them to generate energy as they move.

135
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.780
Do you think that sounds trivial well pay attention to these numbers in total,

136
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.950
the work's amounted to an investment of $31 million and have managed to reduce

137
00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:47.080
the emissions of this building by 40%.

138
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.360
But do you know what this means in economic terms? Well,

139
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.350
it works out to a supply saving of more than $4 million each year,

140
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:57.100
$4 million saving for an investment of just over $30 million.

141
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.680
This represents a return of 14%. And if we also take into account the financing,

142
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.740
then we find that the profitability of the project for the owners and tenants

143
00:08:05.741 --> 00:08:08.350
can easily exceed a return of 20% per year.

144
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:11.860
I'm sure you don't think that is so trivial now.

145
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.600
Well now do the owners of the empire state build

146
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.990
New York city council has calculated that if this intervention were extended to

147
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:24.520
the cities, other major buildings,

148
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.720
that would be the equivalent of taking more than 1.3 million vehicles off the

149
00:08:28.721 --> 00:08:31.960
road while saving hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars.

150
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.640
If you think about it, it makes a lot of sense.

151
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:38.260
So why continue to waste energy and money? But anyway,

152
00:08:38.290 --> 00:08:40.300
let's go a little bit further for the next example.

153
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.210
We're going to travel to India. One of the poorest countries in the world.

154
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:48.880
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

155
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.010
<v 1>Between 2014 and 2018,</v>

156
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.440
the size of the led bulb market in this country multiplied by a hundred in

157
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:58.440
2014, 5 million led bulbs for sold a year.

158
00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:03.090
And that had jumped to more than 670 million, just four years later. And yes,

159
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.690
just as we were asking about the empire state empire case, a priori,

160
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.230
we may find this change trivial to at least until we start taking a look at the

161
00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:11.064
numbers.

162
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.460
Replacing traditional led light bulbs in India has saved more than 30 terawatt

163
00:09:17.461 --> 00:09:17.880
hours.

164
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.870
The equivalent of all electricity consumption in a country like Denmark for an

165
00:09:21.871 --> 00:09:22.620
entire year.

166
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.580
And that's in a country where 75% of electricity is generated by coal,

167
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:31.230
which means that simple switch to LEDs has eliminated a lot of CO2 emissions.

168
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.680
And that was in the only benefit led bulbs consume up to 75%,

169
00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:36.210
less than traditional bulbs.

170
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.810
Therefore we're talking about enormous savings for many of India's poorest

171
00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:40.290
families,

172
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.950
families who thanks to the savings have seen their purchasing power growth.

173
00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.180
Again, why keep wasting energy and money? Well, friends,

174
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.970
there are just two examples among many best of all.

175
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
These kinds of policies could be carried out without having to increase public

176
00:09:54.001 --> 00:09:55.080
spending. How can that be?

177
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:01.910
For example,

178
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.750
instead of handing out subsidies something many politicians are far too used to

179
00:10:05.751 --> 00:10:06.080
doing,

180
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.890
you can reduce consumption taxes on products with a lower environmental impact

181
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.090
such as electric cars,

182
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.900
or you could also extend financing lines on preferential terms or boost

183
00:10:14.901 --> 00:10:16.400
so-called green bonds,

184
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:22.130
green bonds are debt securities that companies or institutions issue to carry

185
00:10:22.131 --> 00:10:24.260
out environmentally responsible projects.

186
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.180
One way to boost them would be for example,

187
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:29.000
to improve the taxation conditions for private investors,

188
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.480
something that is already partially happening in countries like the United

189
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.630
States, that is if you've invested your money in financing green projects,

190
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.820
then you pay less tax on the profits you make.

191
00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:40.130
<v 0>It makes.</v>

192
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.680
<v 1>Sense. Doesn't it? This could drive economic recovery,</v>

193
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:46.700
reduce carbon dioxide emissions and save hundreds and hundreds of billions of

194
00:10:46.701 --> 00:10:49.580
dollars that are commonly used completely. Unproductively.

195
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.310
This is exactly what green recovery is, but wait a minute,

196
00:10:52.311 --> 00:10:53.540
because it doesn't end here.

197
00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:00.860
<v 0>New strategies for new teams.</v>

198
00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.550
<v 1>The second goal we need in this entire strategy is to promote cleaner ways of</v>

199
00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.570
obtaining pertaining energy. And do you know what?

200
00:11:08.571 --> 00:11:09.950
We have some good news here too.

201
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:16.370
According to data from the Lazard investment bank over the past decade,

202
00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.480
wind energy costs have fallen by 69% and the costs of solar energy,

203
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.980
even more by about 88%. In other words, thanks to technological advancement.

204
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.670
These energy sources are three to eight times cheaper than just 10 years ago.

205
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:33.620
You may find it surprising, but in many cases,

206
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:37.100
wind and solar energy are already fully competitive in the market.

207
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.473
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

208
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:45.440
<v 1>In fact, this explains why, for example, a place like Texas, the Mecca,</v>

209
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:46.280
the epicenter,

210
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.330
the heart of America's oil and gas industry is already the leading us state with

211
00:11:50.331 --> 00:11:54.040
the highest installed wind capacity and assumed to be the second in solar

212
00:11:54.041 --> 00:11:56.290
energy. To give you an idea in the United States alone,

213
00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.130
there are already more than 3 million green energy related jobs. Friends.

214
00:12:00.131 --> 00:12:03.760
We're talking about a paradigm shift that along with the closure of dirty coal

215
00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:06.550
mining plants that have caused CO2 emissions to fall,

216
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.370
even though the U S economy has continued to grow in recent years,

217
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.040
I don't know. I'll just call it advancement in this field.

218
00:12:14.041 --> 00:12:16.350
Doesn't stop from the land we move on to the oceans.

219
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.800
<v 0>Take.</v>

220
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.070
<v 1>This Iberdrola project, the East Anglia one in the North sea,</v>

221
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.060
the largest initiative of a Spanish company in the history of renewables and one

222
00:12:30.061 --> 00:12:32.850
that will become one of the largest offshore wind farms on the planet.

223
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.720
We are talking about a macro project that's in total will involve an investment

224
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:44.490
of more than 7.5 billion euros for a capacity of 3,100

225
00:12:44.491 --> 00:12:45.120
MW,

226
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.710
a project that already today and its first phase is generating more than 1,300

227
00:12:49.711 --> 00:12:53.100
jobs and has taken a huge leap in the technological learning curve.

228
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.020
You need to look at the big picture because the problem of carbon dioxide

229
00:13:01.021 --> 00:13:02.430
emissions is a global one,

230
00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:04.380
not just something that happens in developed countries.

231
00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:08.880
<v 0>That is.</v>

232
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.770
<v 1>If we really want to achieve a cleaner world,</v>

233
00:13:10.771 --> 00:13:14.070
we have to find solutions for developing countries as well. In this way,

234
00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:18.120
we could take advantage of the crisis to promote the transition from dirty

235
00:13:18.121 --> 00:13:19.980
energies, like coal to cleaner ones.

236
00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:23.130
And I'm not talking about renewable energies, but also for example,

237
00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:24.623
liquified natural gas.

238
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:27.660
<v 0>Today.</v>

239
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.050
<v 1>This gas is cheaper than coal and although it is still a fossil fuel,</v>

240
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.040
it is much cleaner.

241
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:35.850
Think of coal as producing almost half of all CO2 emissions in the world.

242
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.940
In fact, according to data from the international energy agency,

243
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.840
if we simply replaced coal with other fossil fuels such as natural gas,

244
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:46.890
our total global emissions would be reduced by almost 25%. I mean,

245
00:13:46.891 --> 00:13:49.290
we could have the same energy but much cheaper.

246
00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:50.783
<v 0>Cleanup.</v>

247
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.770
<v 1>To achieve this governments in the most developed countries could promote</v>

248
00:13:55.771 --> 00:13:58.800
private funds that pilot and finance this entire transition.

249
00:13:58.860 --> 00:13:59.880
It would be a good thing for everybody

250
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.480
Along with the benefits of green bonds or financing programs,

251
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:09.990
the substitution of conventional taxes, such as corporation tax,

252
00:14:09.991 --> 00:14:14.370
or part of VAT for new taxes linked to environmental impact could be considered.

253
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.180
These are taxes that already work with relatively good results in some countries

254
00:14:18.181 --> 00:14:21.480
such as Canada. In other words, make those who pollute pay and reward.

255
00:14:21.481 --> 00:14:22.314
Those who strive.

256
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.633
<v 0>Multiple loops.</v>

257
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.970
<v 1>It's complete sense. On one hand,</v>

258
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.750
this change would allow negative externalities to be taxed such as the damage

259
00:14:33.751 --> 00:14:35.400
from pollution. And on the other hand,

260
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:38.820
it would promote investment in competitive clean technologies and after rules.

261
00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.080
That's what we want. Isn't it

262
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:43.951
There's even more,

263
00:14:43.951 --> 00:14:47.850
all these kinds of changes would also drive research and development of even

264
00:14:47.851 --> 00:14:52.190
newer and more exciting technologies such as hydrogen or capture among many

265
00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:52.520
others.

266
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.970
Something that would ultimately allow us to make a new leap in prosperity

267
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.833
standard of living.

268
00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:58.683
<v 0>Okay.</v>

269
00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.850
<v 1>This way even governments could participate in venture capital funds led by</v>

270
00:15:03.851 --> 00:15:07.090
private investors. It's something that we talked about a long time ago,

271
00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:10.960
and it's exactly what Israel did to become one of the most innovative countries

272
00:15:10.961 --> 00:15:12.880
in the world and experienced an economic.

273
00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:16.840
<v 0>Anyway.</v>

274
00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.830
<v 1>As you could see, there are lots of possibilities which indicate green recovery.</v>

275
00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.220
Not only makes sense, but could also be quite an opportunity,

276
00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:27.520
an opportunity to face the crisis, become more competitive, reach,

277
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:31.090
higher levels of prosperity and achieve a greener world with the figures we've

278
00:15:31.091 --> 00:15:33.700
seen. It seems something that's perfectly possible to achieve.

279
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:37.210
<v 0>Cool.</v>

280
00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:38.170
<v 1>It is not clear,</v>

281
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:42.160
not at all clear that these are the kinds of policies that the politicians who

282
00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.340
for example are leading the European union have in mind.

283
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.630
That's why here on this channel,

284
00:15:46.631 --> 00:15:48.460
we wanted to put on the table some alternatives,

285
00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:51.100
which might be good for everyone. But having said that, it's your turn.

286
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:52.750
What do you think of green recovery?

287
00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.000
Do you think our government should move in that direction?

288
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.640
What do you think is the best formula for dealing with this crisis?

289
00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:00.850
