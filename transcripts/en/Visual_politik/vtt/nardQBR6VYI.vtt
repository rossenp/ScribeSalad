<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.260
<v 1>Sylvania is the Transylvania of America. Just as in the land of count, Dracula,</v>

3
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.600
Pennsylvania has some incredible forests.

4
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.440
It is also cold and could well be the scene of one of the worst nightmares for

5
00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:21.470
at least one American president Donald Trump. Right now,

6
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.850
we are going to explain why that is.

7
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.390
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

8
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.430
<v 1>Remember that American voters do not decide to directly which president they</v>

9
00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:34.670
want, but choose the composition of the electoral college.

10
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.760
The electoral college is made up of 538 voters.

11
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.420
The distribution of electoral college members is more or less according to the

12
00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:42.710
population of each state.

13
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.550
And this is where Pennsylvania becomes very important because we're talking

14
00:00:46.551 --> 00:00:49.130
about the fifth most populous state in the United States.

15
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:53.330
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

16
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.470
<v 1>So in Pennsylvania, there are no less than 20 Electra seats at stake.</v>

17
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.260
There are many States that traditionally vote for the same party,

18
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.290
but there are also States where victory is more closely contested.

19
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.790
They are the so-called swing States and Pennsylvania is one of them in 2016.

20
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.510
Trump won this state, but in 2020, it is not clear what will happen.

21
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.850
There are even polls that are very favorable to Biden.

22
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.960
They indicate that Pennsylvania could be instrumental in bringing about a change

23
00:01:17.961 --> 00:01:19.340
of tenant in the white house.

24
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.270
So what may happen in States like Pennsylvania has prompted headlines.

25
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.493
<v 0>Yes.</v>

26
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.120
<v 1>Commit to accepting election results, Forbes.</v>

27
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.800
And now I'm sure you're all wondering,

28
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.910
but what is the problem that Donald Trump only trusts that the elections are

29
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.230
cleaned when he wins?

30
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.870
Why does Trump say that he doesn't trust the election results? Well,

31
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:44.540
the explanation basically comes down to postal voting.

32
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.780
Keep in mind that in us elections in all but two States,

33
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.320
the party that gets the most votes interstate takes all its representatives in

34
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.340
the electoral college.

35
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.940
It doesn't matter if a candidate wins the election by one vote or by a million.

36
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.370
The most important thing is to

37
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.590
A lot of attention is paid to Pennsylvania because although 20 electoral votes

38
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.010
may not seem like much to you keep in mind that along with Florida,

39
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.420
Pennsylvania is the swing state that puts the most folks into play. And in 2016,

40
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:19.220
it was a matter of just 44,000 folks in a state of almost 13 million people

41
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.700
that were enough to make all 20 of those electors fall on Trump's side,

42
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.850
even though the difference was only seven tenths of a percent.

43
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.610
And of course what Trump won by a narrow margin.

44
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.570
He could also lose by a narrow margin. Now those 20 electors could.

45
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.463
<v 0>Beef or Biden.</v>

46
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.070
<v 1>You lose sight of the fact that we're talking about 20 votes,</v>

47
00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:44.030
that one candidate wins and 20 votes that the other candidate fails to win.

48
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.990
Four years ago,

49
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.000
77 electoral college votes separated Trump and Clinton from these figures.

50
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.200
Pennsylvania represents

51
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.090
Halfway to the Democrats turn around. That's why Trump is so concerned.

52
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.830
This is an election where every detail could make a difference.

53
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.280
<v 2>It was a mail-in ballots.</v>

54
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.540
2020 will be the most rigged election in our nation's history.

55
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.910
Unless this stupidity is ended.

56
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.720
We voted during world war II and world war two, no problem.

57
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.100
But now they're using COVID in order to cheat by using Malins Donald Trump.

58
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.680
<v 1>Just around the corner. The question is why is voting by mail so scary to Trump?</v>

59
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.590
How might it affect States like Pennsylvania, more importantly,

60
00:03:31.591 --> 00:03:35.010
how do Pennsylvanians view this election today on visual politics?

61
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.130
We're going to answer all of these questions, but first let's take a look here.

62
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.170
<v 3>So history, sleepy,</v>

63
00:03:43.171 --> 00:03:44.004
Joe.

64
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.540
<v 2>Rides through Pittsburgh, they are.</v>

65
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.050
<v 1>A few places that you can feel as close to the history of the United States.</v>

66
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.100
As you do in pencil.

67
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.500
<v 3>Pennsylvania.</v>

68
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.980
<v 1>It's a state where Philadelphia is located and it was in the city that in the</v>

69
00:03:58.981 --> 00:04:02.040
18th century, the independence of the United States was.

70
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:06.060
<v 3>This.</v>

71
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.220
<v 1>Ring, the Liberty bell in the independence hall,</v>

72
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.350
a bell that you can still visit today.

73
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:13.390
<v 3>During the.</v>

74
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:14.970
<v 1>Civil war in the 19th century,</v>

75
00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:17.850
Pennsylvania was the scene of one of the most decisive battle.

76
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.590
<v 0>The battle of Gettysburg.</v>

77
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.250
<v 1>And during the 20th century,</v>

78
00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:27.090
Pittsburgh steel was the material from which new York's great skyscrapers like

79
00:04:27.091 --> 00:04:31.320
the empire state building were made. So basically Pennsylvania is rich.

80
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.100
<v 0>With American history. In fact.</v>

81
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.090
<v 1>Friends to talk about steel is to talk about the high point in Pennsylvania's</v>

82
00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:39.540
economy.

83
00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.990
The steel industry was the state's main industry along with coal mining.

84
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.110
But I think that you will agree with me that these are industries that have been

85
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:48.720
losing important since world war two. And since then,

86
00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:51.720
new ways of generating energy have displaced coal. Meanwhile,

87
00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.900
steel has been imported from Asian countries, such as China. However,

88
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:55.681
in many cases,

89
00:04:55.681 --> 00:04:59.040
this means taking advantage of unfair competition or even dumping.

90
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.490
I think it's a commercial practice that consists of selling a product below its

91
00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:07.950
normal price, or even below its cost of production.

92
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.590
In order to eliminate competitors take over the market,

93
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.690
a very risky tactic for a private company,

94
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.490
but within reach of Chinese companies,

95
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.290
which are strongly supported by the state.

96
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.220
Therefore many industries in Pennsylvania have been slowly.

97
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.850
<v 0>Losing their doors. Pennsylvania.</v>

98
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.160
<v 1>Was once a very important to the U S economy,</v>

99
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.460
but for several decades now its influence has been declining today.

100
00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:33.120
We find a state without major cities, beyond Philadelphia or Pittsburgh.

101
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.870
27% of the population is rural while throughout the rest of the United States.

102
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.290
The average is 19%. So many of the steel mills are gone,

103
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:42.450
but Pennsylvanians still have their farms

104
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.350
As a state in which the primary sector also plays a very important role.

105
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.630
They are one of the largest producers of mushrooms.

106
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.550
<v 0>Apples, and very products. Of course,</v>

107
00:05:56.551 --> 00:05:57.950
right now you're asking.

108
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.000
<v 1>So given the state of affairs, what party do Pennsylvanians usually vote for?</v>

109
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.230
Well, as I mentioned before,

110
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.530
Pennsylvania is a swing state and things are usually pretty close,

111
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.390
but we could say that in the last few decades,

112
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.470
it has been a democratic state since 1988 to Pennsylvania and has voted for the

113
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:14.900
democratic party presidential candidates six times,

114
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.480
Moreover its current governor Tom Wolf is from the democratic party.

115
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.050
He took office in 2014 and is pretty popular. That's why,

116
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.420
what happened four years ago was such a surprise.

117
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.510
Pennsylvania's 20 electoral college voters went to Donald Trump,

118
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.070
the anti-globalization speech and America first message actually worked many

119
00:06:36.071 --> 00:06:39.790
people, including many Pennsylvania voted for Trump to do just that.

120
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.120
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

121
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.010
<v 2>Donald Trump to slap 25% tariff on steel imports. Financial times.</v>

122
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.460
<v 1>That was the beginning of the cascade of tariffs that brought about the trade</v>

123
00:06:51.461 --> 00:06:54.750
war with China. And now that Trump's first term is over it's time to take.

124
00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.660
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

125
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.160
<v 1>2001 Pennsylvania steel industry employed 54,000 workers.</v>

126
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.720
George Bush's presidency ended with 24% fewer jobs as a result of the great

127
00:07:07.721 --> 00:07:09.190
recession and Chinese dumping.

128
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.940
Obama's eight years in office did not improve things much employment in the

129
00:07:12.941 --> 00:07:17.680
secretary fell another 18% in contrast the data with Trump has improved

130
00:07:17.681 --> 00:07:21.130
somewhat employment in Pennsylvania steel mills Rose 4%.

131
00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:24.130
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

132
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.320
<v 1>Of course the industry has far from recovered,</v>

133
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.450
but at least Trump has managed to stop the trend.

134
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:32.290
So basically we could say that Pennsylvania is one of the States that has gained

135
00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.660
from Trump's policies and yes, it's true.

136
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.990
Many other States and many other industries have been hurt by steel tariffs,

137
00:07:37.991 --> 00:07:39.460
but we have to recognize one thing.

138
00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.100
Donald Trump has created a trend around the world. Listen.

139
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:45.910
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

140
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:50.560
<v 2>Canada's Trudeau hits China for dumping steel on global markets</v>

141
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:51.423
business inquire.

142
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.290
You extends anti-dumping duties on Chinese steel you're at.

143
00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.140
<v 1>So we agree that Trump has made the correct call.</v>

144
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.160
However he possibly overdid it and his solutions were not the most appropriate.

145
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.460
It is one thing to take a series of targeted measures in particular sectors,

146
00:08:06.461 --> 00:08:09.370
but it is quite another to launch an entire trade war.

147
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.180
The exchange of Paris between China and the United States has made it difficult

148
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.840
for Pennsylvania and companies to sell abroad and has increased their costs.

149
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.830
And this is the downside of protectionism. Yes. In the short term,

150
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.620
steel exporters have regained some of the market they lost,

151
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.870
but other industries are paying the price.

152
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.590
<v 2>Trump tariffs costs Pennsylvania more than $700 million in</v>

153
00:08:32.591 --> 00:08:34.570
2019. WITF.

154
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.990
<v 1>This cost increase has spread to many sectors of the economy in this state.</v>

155
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:41.440
Also the agricultural sector, still Trump is not planning to back down.

156
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:45.250
This is his policy and America first is what makes him different from previous

157
00:08:45.251 --> 00:08:48.250
white house tenants. It also serves to appeal to good Patriots.

158
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.610
That's why he says China would rather sit down and negotiate trade agreements

159
00:08:51.611 --> 00:08:52.870
with Biden. Then with him.

160
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:58.290
<v 0>They'd say it is sleepy, Joe, sir, just sign right there.</v>

161
00:08:58.291 --> 00:08:59.190
Okay.

162
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:08.520
We've been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year to China.

163
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.110
That's the stop. They understand that.

164
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.920
<v 1>Trump has taken the steps. People expected him to take,</v>

165
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.720
but the result isn't quite what they expected.

166
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.590
So his worst nightmares are about to come true this year, 2020,

167
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.380
it's a horror movie for Trump. Let's take a closer look.

168
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.243
<v 0>Right now.</v>

169
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:29.570
<v 2>[Inaudible] to the COVID vampire.</v>

170
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:34.310
<v 1>Is there anything worse than being in Transylvania, surrounded by vampires? Yes.</v>

171
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.850
Yes. There is that besides sucking your blood, you get the coronavirus

172
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.840
In the United States.

173
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:46.160
There have already been 220,000 deaths from coronavirus and more than 8 million

174
00:09:46.161 --> 00:09:46.940
infections,

175
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.840
Pennsylvania rates eight for the state with the most deaths by COVID-19 more

176
00:09:50.841 --> 00:09:55.220
than 8,500 infections already surpass 180,000.

177
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.070
There is a particularly serious circumstance in Pennsylvania.

178
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:01.700
It ranks four from the list of States with the oldest population in the country.

179
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.850
It was also one of the places most effected at the beginning of the pandemic.

180
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:11.930
The only reason the numbers aren't worse is because they don't have large

181
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.600
metropolises other than Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.

182
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.820
Pennsylvania's governor moderate Democrats,

183
00:10:16.821 --> 00:10:20.870
Tom Wolf took confinement measures for some counties in mid-March before

184
00:10:20.871 --> 00:10:22.850
extending them to all of Pennsylvania.

185
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:26.780
The deescalation was also County by County and in different phases that lasted

186
00:10:26.781 --> 00:10:30.170
until early June. Was there an alternative? Well in may,

187
00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:31.850
there was at least one man who fought.

188
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:36.630
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

189
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:41.420
<v 2>People of Pennsylvania want their freedom now and are fully aware of what that</v>

190
00:10:41.421 --> 00:10:45.800
entails. The Democrats are moving slowly across America for political purposes.

191
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.190
They would wait until November 3rd. If we were up to them, don't play politics.

192
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.380
You're safe. Move quickly. Donald Trump.

193
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:58.940
<v 1>Here is one more example of how tight the presidential elections are going to</v>

194
00:10:58.941 --> 00:11:00.140
be. As you can imagine,

195
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:03.500
the incidence of the coronavirus in Pennsylvania was concentrated,

196
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.450
especially in the beginning in Philadelphia,

197
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:09.380
Philadelphia County massively supports the Democrats. Four years ago,

198
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:13.670
Hillary Clinton got 82% of the vote that was almost half a million votes,

199
00:11:13.671 --> 00:11:17.810
more than Trump. They brutal figure in Pittsburgh. The Democrats also won,

200
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.070
but the fight was more balanced

201
00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:23.961
In contrast.

202
00:11:23.961 --> 00:11:27.980
Rural Pennsylvania is closer to the Republican party and is emerging relatively

203
00:11:27.981 --> 00:11:29.480
unscaved from the pandemic.

204
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.600
So you can get an idea of who supported president Trump's calls to end for

205
00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.350
quarantine in Pennsylvania. President Trump is recovering from the Korea.

206
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.720
<v 0>Virus. And so is America.</v>

207
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.680
<v 1>Even major protests against social distancing. What's more,</v>

208
00:11:42.681 --> 00:11:46.040
the Republicans controlled the state legislature and tightened the court on

209
00:11:46.041 --> 00:11:49.850
deescalation so much that they forced the governor to use his veto power.

210
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.300
<v 0>Governor Vito's bills to allow counties,</v>

211
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:59.080
various industries to reopen WJ act.

212
00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:03.810
<v 1>We therefore find an even more polarized electorate in Pennsylvania than we did</v>

213
00:12:03.811 --> 00:12:04.590
four years ago.

214
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:08.070
The divide has widened between the urban pro Democrat send supporters of

215
00:12:08.071 --> 00:12:11.850
restrictive measures to contain the virus and the rural pro Republicans who

216
00:12:11.851 --> 00:12:15.120
believe that governor Wolf's measures have stifled the state's economy and its

217
00:12:15.121 --> 00:12:17.340
businesses. The infection of Trump, his wife,

218
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.910
his son and half the white house has certainly been a blow to Republican

219
00:12:20.911 --> 00:12:21.690
aspirations.

220
00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:25.290
We no longer need any further proof that the Corona virus is rampant in the

221
00:12:25.291 --> 00:12:26.124
United States.

222
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.740
This is not to say that we are much better off in the rest of the world,

223
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:31.860
but understand that the American voter cares about his or her own.

224
00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.180
So in Pennsylvania,

225
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:36.150
the Republicans have looked for other issues to hurt the Democrats with.

226
00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.610
And another issue they think they could take advantage of is.

227
00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:44.370
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

228
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:48.360
<v 1>Is a hydrocarbon extraction technique that consists of injecting a special fluid</v>

229
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.830
at high pressure into the subsoil to break up the rock and extract the gas or

230
00:12:52.831 --> 00:12:53.310
the oil.

231
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:57.510
It requires the use of more expensive technology than that used in conventional

232
00:12:57.511 --> 00:12:58.290
energy fields.

233
00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:02.400
The high price that crude oil reached in the last 15 years made fracking viable

234
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.820
the subject of a whole energy revolution in the United States.

235
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:09.390
Since then Pennsylvania has become the second largest natural gas producing

236
00:13:09.391 --> 00:13:11.850
state in the United States. Only behind Texas.

237
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:16.410
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

238
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.560
<v 1>Trump has tried to use the Democrats opposition to fracking,</v>

239
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:23.820
to gain support in the areas surrounding Pittsburgh and Biden has had to hold

240
00:13:23.821 --> 00:13:27.750
the greenest faction of the democratic party, uh, hopes to end fracking.

241
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.350
He knows that announcing such a measure could end his chances of winning over

242
00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.210
Pennsylvania voters. But then again,

243
00:13:33.211 --> 00:13:36.090
he did choose Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate.

244
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.850
And I assure you that Pennsylvanians have good memories.

245
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:41.580
Here is Kamala Harris in September, 2019.

246
00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:46.080
<v 0>There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking. Yeah.</v>

247
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.770
<v 1>You heard it yourself. Kamala Harris, herself,</v>

248
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:54.300
future vice president of the United States. If Biden wins and possibly more,

249
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.690
if anything else happens in the near future, she knows where she stands.

250
00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.820
She is in favor of banning fracking.

251
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:04.410
So it's clear this election in Pennsylvania is going to be very, very close.

252
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.090
Who knows if it will be decisive,

253
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.600
but now let's talk about something that could make one or the other candidate

254
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:10.463
win.

255
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.180
<v 0>Nightmare on Pennsylvania Avenue.</v>

256
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.860
<v 1>You now know that Donald Jr and Ivanka Trump,</v>

257
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.030
we're not afraid of the terrifying characters of the eighties like Freddy

258
00:14:24.031 --> 00:14:26.730
Krueger. No, their nightmares were played by the boogeyman,

259
00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.380
but the boogeyman who brings them back,

260
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.180
Why the United States little is being said about this issue.

261
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.760
And it is possible that from November 4th onwards,

262
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:42.300
little else will be talked about at stake would be the person who gets to reside

263
00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.240
at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington.

264
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.480
And of course you can think about whether at this point in the film,

265
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.200
voting by mail is really such an important issue.

266
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.200
Well remembered that it's 2020 and anything is possible.

267
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.630
2020 has changed the rules of social behavior.

268
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:59.360
It's so many areas and also electoral base.

269
00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:02.680
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

270
00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.800
<v 1>Iris is in the streets and there are many people who would prefer to avoid</v>

271
00:15:05.801 --> 00:15:09.670
crowded places like public relations States have had to rush through new methods

272
00:15:09.671 --> 00:15:13.150
of voting because some did not contemplate the possibility of voting before

273
00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.190
election day, without a justified reason.

274
00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:19.900
It is expected that in this election mail-in voting will skyrocket because

275
00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:22.150
people are afraid. And of course in California,

276
00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.180
we're not talking about a handful of votes, but in the swing States,

277
00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.060
it could be crucial. That may be the case in Pennsylvania,

278
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:31.060
traditionally for a vote by mail to be valid in the United States.

279
00:15:31.061 --> 00:15:34.390
It had to arrive at the County elections office on election day.

280
00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:36.400
At the latest in August,

281
00:15:36.401 --> 00:15:40.390
the us postal service itself warned Pennsylvania ins that the backlog in their

282
00:15:40.391 --> 00:15:44.170
offices could cause their votes not to be counted if they did not vote more than

283
00:15:44.171 --> 00:15:45.580
15 days before the election,

284
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:49.390
all this has culminated in a new dispute between Republicans and Democrats that

285
00:15:49.391 --> 00:15:50.320
has ended up in.

286
00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.980
<v 0>Pennsylvania Supreme court sides with Democrats extends mail-in ballot deadlines</v>

287
00:15:59.981 --> 00:16:02.920
to three days after election day, AP news.

288
00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:03.640
<v 1>This way,</v>

289
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.940
Pennsylvania will consider the votes that arrive at the electoral office as good

290
00:16:06.941 --> 00:16:08.800
until three days after November.

291
00:16:08.801 --> 00:16:12.310
Third Republicans have appealed this decision at the federal level to the

292
00:16:12.311 --> 00:16:13.144
Supreme court.

293
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:16.150
But hold on a minute because the fights between Republicans and Democrats have

294
00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:17.770
only just begun Republicans,

295
00:16:17.771 --> 00:16:21.370
believe the conditions are in place for the electoral fraud of the century.

296
00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.580
They've also called for ballots to be rendered invalid for voters whose

297
00:16:24.581 --> 00:16:28.300
signatures are not accurately identified with the officially registered one or

298
00:16:28.301 --> 00:16:31.270
that voting by mail directly through a mailbox, not to be allowed.

299
00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.220
Everything is in the hands of the courts.

300
00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:36.970
And the worst thing is that in other States like Ohio or Texas,

301
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.940
the story is similar, uh, chaos off gigantic proportions.

302
00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.130
But to understand what is happening, you have to take a look.

303
00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.113
<v 0>Look at this.</v>

304
00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:51.040
<v 1>This poll conducted by the center for opinion, research in Pennsylvania,</v>

305
00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:55.000
more than half of Democrats plan to vote by mail while only 10% of the

306
00:16:55.001 --> 00:16:57.340
Republicans plan to do so. In 2016,

307
00:16:57.370 --> 00:17:01.000
there were 300,000 mail ballots in Pennsylvania. This year,

308
00:17:01.001 --> 00:17:03.610
that number will probably increase five or six fold.

309
00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.040
Bring the total closer to 2 million votes.

310
00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:08.380
This is when it pays to remember that in 2016,

311
00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:11.920
the elections in the state were decided by a ridiculous margin of folks.

312
00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:15.460
Trump had 44,000 more votes than Hillary Clinton.

313
00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.250
And I'll give you another fact before the postal vote was counted.

314
00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.940
Republican margin was only 20,000 votes higher. Where am I going with all this?

315
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.850
Well, I want to get to the point that election night promises strong emotion.

316
00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:29.380
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

317
00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:33.460
<v 1>It is certain that the count in Pennsylvania will begin in favor of Donald</v>

318
00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:37.030
Trump. Thanks to the count in rural areas, which is faster than in the cities.

319
00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:37.600
In addition,

320
00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:41.650
there are predictions from the economist that even we've up to 70% progress in

321
00:17:41.651 --> 00:17:45.490
the mail ballot counts, Pennsylvania may still hold onto a Republican victory.

322
00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.110
And here we have two scenarios.

323
00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.940
Imagine that those 20 electoral college votes at stake in the end of the

324
00:17:50.941 --> 00:17:51.810
decisive ones,

325
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.320
how would Donald Trump view his shift from a Republican Pennsylvania to a

326
00:17:55.321 --> 00:17:56.580
democratic Pennsylvania?

327
00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:00.410
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

328
00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:02.960
<v 1>Furthermore, I'm not talking about a last minute change,</v>

329
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:06.050
but rather after counting all the votes that have arrived by Friday,

330
00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.560
November 6th, I can imagine you all on Twitter, just constantly pressing F five.

331
00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:13.040
Then there is the other alternative. If things are very tight,

332
00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.910
it could be that if a figure as low as 3% of the postal votes were not counted

333
00:18:16.911 --> 00:18:19.490
because they arrived late or if they were not considered valid,

334
00:18:19.491 --> 00:18:22.100
for whatever reason, the balance would fall one way or.

335
00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:26.080
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

336
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.380
<v 1>So far absentee voting is Donald Trump's worst nightmare. After November 3rd,</v>

337
00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.790
it could be everyone's worst nightmare could something equally bad happened.

338
00:18:33.791 --> 00:18:36.830
If Trump didn't accept the election results? Well, yes,

339
00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:38.630
and they are already preparing us for it.

340
00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:47.240
<v 2>Biden says Chicago honoree at polls is the only way he could lose us</v>

341
00:18:47.241 --> 00:18:48.350
election. Roy.

342
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:52.220
<v 1>It is likely that if there is no victory to one of the two contenders,</v>

343
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:53.870
it will be a mess. Whatever happens.

344
00:18:53.871 --> 00:18:56.210
We will be keeping you posted here on visual politic,

345
00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.130
but now the questions are over to you.

346
00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.610
Do you think we will have a final result on election day or will we have to

347
00:19:01.611 --> 00:19:04.700
wait? Do you think the Pennsylvania results will be so close this time?

348
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:06.650
Furthermore, if you were from the state,

349
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.280
would you still be with Trump or would you bet on.

350
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.350
<v 2>[Inaudible] if you want to learn more about politics and world affairs and</v>
