00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:06.390
<v 1>Round.</v>

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.480
<v 0>News is the world's first news comparison platform.</v>

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.320
It will let you see how various media have processed information and alert you

5
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:14.640
to their political point of view.

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.240
This allows you to have a better awareness of what you are reading via a

7
00:00:18.241 --> 00:00:19.530
political spectrum at all.

8
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.040
See the news you're not seeing ground news is geographic filters.

9
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.210
Let you search everything from hyper local news to global events and with all

10
00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:30.120
the information coming out about the current events with the police and the

11
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.260
protestors in the U S you'll be able to find accurate statistics and reliable

12
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:37.980
facts. News changes quickly and cycles are shorter than ever,

13
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.450
but at ground news,

14
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.900
you can keep track of all the threats concerning your topics of interest,

15
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.580
refresh your memory on stories, or just observe the ways news spirals out.

16
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.760
You can also audit your own news. Yes, that's right.

17
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.450
They give you a simple view of who has covered a story and where each outlet

18
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:56.130
falls on the political spectrum.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.880
Now let's get into today's video.

23
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.003
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

24
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.630
<v 0>America has a problem protests over George Floyd's death are the last straw.</v>

25
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.350
And this video we're going to put the racial issue aside and focus on a much

26
00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:23.480
more specific problem. Police brutality.

27
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.880
<v 1>Think about it more than 1000 people.</v>

28
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.450
<v 0>Died at the hands of the police every year in the United States. Of course,</v>

29
00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:35.240
this number can be much higher in other countries. For example,

30
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.490
Venezuelan police killed more than 5,500 people in 2018, but let's be honest,

31
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.170
having these things happen in Venezuela,

32
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.070
given its recent political and economic problems is hardly surprising where the

33
00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:48.530
United States is. The world's greatest power,

34
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.610
even worse is the fact that the United States has the highest crime rates in the

35
00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:55.070
developed world. In other words, police in the USA,

36
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.080
I'm not doing their job well, and this is a more serious problem than it's.

37
00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.383
<v 1>Seems.</v>

38
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.190
<v 0>The state is an institution that offers services in exchange for our taxes of</v>

39
00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:09.740
all the services. The most important is security.

40
00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:13.310
It doesn't matter if we're talking about a system that's socialist capitalist or

41
00:02:13.311 --> 00:02:14.450
an absolute monarchy.

42
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.260
We all agree that the main function of the state is to provide security for

43
00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:21.950
citizens. In this sense, United States leaves much to be desired.

44
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.960
Make some comparisons.

45
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.990
Anyone who lives in Europe can walk down the street without being afraid of

46
00:02:29.991 --> 00:02:33.950
cops. Yet crime rates are much lower than in the USA in a country,

47
00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:35.720
such as Spain or the Czech Republic.

48
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.340
The murder rate is 0.6 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants in the

49
00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:43.700
United States. It is 4.958 times higher.

50
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.520
If someone were able to solve this one problem right now,

51
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.460
it would be enough to really make America great again.

52
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.850
And we're talking about something that interests both Democrats and Republicans.

53
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.500
<v 1>But that's an old surprising.</v>

54
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.250
<v 0>As it may seem. This is a problem that have a solution.</v>

55
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.080
There is no need to reinvent the wheel here,

56
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.300
just copied what other countries have already done.

57
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.080
And we have an example that could provide many ideas to the U S politicians.

58
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.003
<v 1>Yes.</v>

59
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.220
<v 0>Official politic the Spanish police have much to contribute to the world.</v>

60
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.083
To give you an idea.

61
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.780
Spain has one of the lowest crime rates in the world and how many people died at

62
00:03:21.781 --> 00:03:25.350
the hands of the police last year? Zero, absolutely zero. In fact,

63
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.830
this is not the first time the Spanish police have been used as an example for

64
00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:29.664
other countries.

65
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.270
<v 1>A new civil guard,</v>

66
00:03:36.271 --> 00:03:40.050
contingent to parts for Afghanistan to train police in Herat and Kaboom.

67
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.620
<v 0>The question is how can the U S solve its problem with the police?</v>

68
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.230
What could Spain contribute to that solution today?

69
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.200
We're going to answer these questions, but first let's look at some history.

70
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.070
<v 1>The police army.</v>

71
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.850
<v 0>You may be surprised, but 6% of the us population are war veterans.</v>

72
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:00.600
That's right.

73
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.660
We're talking about people that have been fighting at the front and who's

74
00:04:03.661 --> 00:04:07.170
returned to civilian. Life often comes with a lot of truffles.

75
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.600
Many of them suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder,

76
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.260
which is a real nightmare that many cannot escape from others are unable to find

77
00:04:13.261 --> 00:04:14.520
a job. And at the end of the day,

78
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.910
the skills they have learned on the front line are of little use in civilian

79
00:04:17.911 --> 00:04:22.590
life. It's a fact, the us owes a huge debt to its veterans. And in many cases,

80
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.880
it's not able to repay it.

81
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.970
This explains the government's programs to help integrate these veterans.

82
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.150
One of them is the police that's right for decades. All governments,

83
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.890
both local and federal have prioritized war veterans when hiring new cops and

84
00:04:40.891 --> 00:04:41.940
the result today,

85
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.690
one in five police officers in the United States is a war veteran.

86
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.670
And you're probably thinking where's the problem.

87
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.030
After all a former soldier seems to be the right person to be a cop, right?

88
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.190
He or she knows how to use a weapon,

89
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.300
how to work as a team and how to deal with high stress situations. And yes,

90
00:04:57.301 --> 00:04:58.230
you will be right there.

91
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.270
Well,

92
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.080
the problem is that there are more than 18,000 different police forces in the

93
00:05:07.081 --> 00:05:10.620
United States and each one works completely independently.

94
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.600
And this set up becomes a really serious problem.

95
00:05:12.601 --> 00:05:15.870
When we talk about the war on drugs until the 1970s,

96
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.840
most of the criminals encountered by the police were petty thieves,

97
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.070
armed with guns and knives,

98
00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.600
but everything changed in the 1980s with the advent of the big drug cartel.

99
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.673
<v 1>Yes.</v>

100
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.770
<v 0>Suddenly criminals were using top-notch weapons, assault, rifles,</v>

101
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.080
Uzi machine guns, and even grenade launches.

102
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.830
So what was the outcome that the police had to update their weapons in order to

103
00:05:37.831 --> 00:05:40.890
stand a chance against this new threat, consider this so far,

104
00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:43.320
we've talked about the numbers of murders committed by the police,

105
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.290
but we should also talk about the number of cops killed in the us

106
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.130
between 2020 14 alone.

107
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.920
More than 2,400 policemen were killed by criminals who increasingly

108
00:05:57.921 --> 00:05:59.960
better trained. Think about it for a minute.

109
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.830
We're talking about a country where it's incredibly easy to get a firearm at

110
00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:05.930
this, to the arrival of well-organized gangs.

111
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.710
And you have the ideal cocktail for an ultra violent society.

112
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.950
In circumstances like this, you need a police officer who is up to it.

113
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.860
And so in 1981, the United States Congress passed.

114
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.893
<v 1>This law.</v>

115
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.400
<v 2>Let's read cooperation with civilian law enforcement agencies act as a United</v>

116
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:24.401
States.

117
00:06:24.401 --> 00:06:28.960
Federal law enacted in 1981 that allows the United States armed forces to

118
00:06:28.961 --> 00:06:31.990
cooperate with domestic and foreign law enforcement agencies.

119
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.020
<v 0>Words. This law allowed all Pentagon weaponry.</v>

120
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.560
That was no longer being used in conflicts to be reused by the police.

121
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.920
Think about it more and more war veterans are working as cops,

122
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.370
and they're also using the same weapons they used on the war front of the

123
00:06:45.371 --> 00:06:45.820
problem.

124
00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.880
The problem is that the streets of Baghdad have nothing to do with the streets

125
00:06:48.881 --> 00:06:49.714
of Kansas city.

126
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.290
A wartime soldier needs totally different training than a cop who has to work

127
00:06:53.291 --> 00:06:54.910
together with his own neighbors.

128
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.880
And the question is to what extent do us cops get the training?

129
00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:58.743
<v 1>They need.</v>

130
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.250
<v 0>Selves to be a cop in Texas.</v>

131
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.550
You need to spend about four months at the police Academy to be a policeman in

132
00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:10.060
Finland. You need to do a two year master's degree and Norway.

133
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.460
We're talking about three years training and in Spain,

134
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.220
it's between nine months and one year. In other words,

135
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.690
over the past few decades,

136
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.400
nearly all of those 18,000 us police forces have assumed that all war veterans

137
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:24.460
were more than prepared to be a cop of just a few weeks of class.

138
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.730
And as you can imagine, it's not enough, but hold on a minute because that,

139
00:07:27.731 --> 00:07:28.630
isn't the only problem.

140
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.590
If you thought that the purpose of this video is to criticize the us army. Well,

141
00:07:32.591 --> 00:07:34.030
you're very, very wrong. Actually,

142
00:07:34.031 --> 00:07:37.150
there is a very big difference between the army and the police and the

143
00:07:37.151 --> 00:07:37.990
differences. This.

144
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:44.320
<v 2>Us military personnel have been convicted of $5 million worth of cranes.</v>

145
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.580
<v 0>Oddly enough, this is good news. It means there's justice in the U S military.</v>

146
00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.020
If you do wrong, you pay the price.

147
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.860
And this is explained by the fact that the U S military has a long tradition of

148
00:07:53.861 --> 00:07:56.560
respect for institutions. If a soldier commits a crime,

149
00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:57.730
no one's going to defend it.

150
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.870
This explains why soldiers who tortured prisoners of war in Abu Ghraib prison

151
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.900
were immediately tried for example. And you'll probably be wondering,

152
00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:06.550
so what about the police?

153
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.630
Are there any laws governing the police in the U S well, I'll let you.

154
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.713
<v 1>Yourselves.</v>

155
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.810
<v 2>For Chicago police officers fired and an alleged cover-up for Jason van.</v>

156
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.740
<v 0>This is just one example of what we've been able to find out about.</v>

157
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.330
No matter what report you read,

158
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.870
no one doubts that many police officers cover for their colleagues,

159
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.120
regardless of whether they were in the rights or wrong.

160
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.850
All of this helps explain why in recent years,

161
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.180
us police have killed more than 7,600 citizens,

162
00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.300
but only 48 policemen have actually been convicted.

163
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:38.380
And the rest haven't even met.

164
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:39.423
<v 1>It's a trial.</v>

165
00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:48.280
<v 0>For this qualitative immunity and trade unions. You see, unlike the military,</v>

166
00:08:48.281 --> 00:08:52.210
the police in the United States can join a trade union and police unions have

167
00:08:52.211 --> 00:08:56.520
enormous power in that country, especially this one, the order of police,

168
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.450
they have more than 340,000 members and are a pressure group with a lot of

169
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:03.240
influence in Washington. It's influence explains news headlines.

170
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:04.303
<v 1>Yes.</v>

171
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:11.060
<v 0>We screw up director. Obama caused a war on cops. Exactly.</v>

172
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.630
Every time a politician has tried to reform the police in the United States,

173
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:18.170
they have clashed with the refusal of police unions and all of this puts the

174
00:09:18.171 --> 00:09:20.450
murder of George Floyd into clear context.

175
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.050
The cop who killed him knew it was almost impossible for him to go to jail for

176
00:09:24.051 --> 00:09:26.690
something like that. At the end of the day, who was going to judge him,

177
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.500
judicial doctrines are in his favor and the other policemen are going to defend

178
00:09:30.501 --> 00:09:30.770
him.

179
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:34.280
And the political institutions are not going to raise their voices for fear of

180
00:09:34.281 --> 00:09:36.500
reprisals from trade unions. And you'll say,

181
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.280
does the white house really not dare regulate the police for fear.

182
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:40.933
<v 1>Bunions?</v>

183
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.970
<v 0>Well, the truth is that all kinds of programs have tried to solve this problem.</v>

184
00:09:46.971 --> 00:09:50.000
In the past, for example, during the Obama administration,

185
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:54.020
the innovative police program was approved. Its intentions were fantastic.

186
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.140
Train the cops to learn how to use physical force proportionately, the problem,

187
00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:58.760
the execution in the end,

188
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.930
all those good intentions resulted in well visits to museums of African-American

189
00:10:02.931 --> 00:10:06.560
history and days of debate among policemen to discuss the problems of race in

190
00:10:06.561 --> 00:10:07.490
the United States.

191
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.880
And I think you can probably imagine how effective these programs have been.

192
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.050
And you're probably wondering,

193
00:10:12.051 --> 00:10:16.280
is there any way to improve the police in the USA? Well, the truth is yes.

194
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.330
Let's take a look right now.

195
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.380
What spin can. Sure. The United States by now,

196
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:27.500
I'm sure you've all seen the video of George Floyd's murder.

197
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:30.830
And if you haven't seen it well, you can find it on any social network.

198
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.770
We are not going to include the footage here. As a matter of respect,

199
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.550
the truth is what the cop does in the video is not anything that police don't do

200
00:10:37.551 --> 00:10:40.430
in any other country. It's, what's called a ni restraint.

201
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:43.700
That is the pop immobilizes, the criminal by placing his knee.

202
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.520
<v 3>Oh, I don't know if [inaudible].</v>

203
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.550
<v 0>What's the problem. As we always say here, or visual politic,</v>

204
00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.160
the devil is in the details. The copy in this video, places,

205
00:10:58.161 --> 00:11:00.980
the knee over Floyd's neck, instead of his back in addition,

206
00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:04.160
the knee restraint is a maneuver that lasts between one and two minutes.

207
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:07.490
The time needed to be able to handcuff the suspect for transport to the police

208
00:11:07.491 --> 00:11:09.110
station. I mean, in this case,

209
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.960
we'd be talking about negligent practice in the very least.

210
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:15.440
So the question is what would have happened if the death of George Floyd had

211
00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:18.920
occurred in Spain instead of the United States? Well, in that case,

212
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.070
the policemen would have had to write a very detailed report of everything that.

213
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:23.143
<v 1>What happened.</v>

214
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:28.640
<v 0>Well, the cop hadn't lied,</v>

215
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:32.270
medical examiner could analyze the body to find out why the victim died.

216
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.750
And this report would be grounds for George Floyd's family to report the Spanish

217
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:36.380
policemen.

218
00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.920
And chances are that the cop would end up sentenced to several years in prison.

219
00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.860
According to the Spanish legal system, this crime is a torture.

220
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:44.180
This isn't something I just made up.

221
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.540
The truth is that there have been very similar cases. Look at this.

222
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.340
<v 1>Spain for several guards convicted.</v>

223
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.710
<v 2>Of torturing members of the terrorist group atta.</v>

224
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.520
<v 0>And I know what many of you will be thinking, Josh, that's a lie.</v>

225
00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:03.270
Spain has a lot of convictions from the human rights court in Strasburg for

226
00:12:03.271 --> 00:12:05.160
police brutality vans. Yes, you're right.

227
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:09.300
There are many cases of alleged police brutality in Spain for a start amnesty

228
00:12:09.301 --> 00:12:13.290
international has denounced several human rights violations during protests,

229
00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.920
by Catalan independence. The question is what happens in other countries.

230
00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:20.760
And the truth is that Spain does not have many more combinations than other

231
00:12:20.761 --> 00:12:24.330
European countries, such as France or Germany. In other words, in every country,

232
00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.570
there are bad cops, but if we compare Spain to the rest of the world,

233
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.350
we discover a police force that stands out for being particularly novel.

234
00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.870
This is truly surprising when you take into account the history of Spain,

235
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.450
for those of you who don't know until 1975,

236
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.090
Spain was under the thumb of a military dictatorship,

237
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.710
like all military dictators,

238
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.970
general Francisco Franco was not concerned with human rights for decades.

239
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.140
The Spaniards suffered unthinkable levels of police repression worse than in any

240
00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:58.320
other European country. But everything changed in 1986,

241
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:59.850
the year in which this law passed.

242
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:06.360
<v 2>Ganache law two forward slash one nine, eight, six,</v>

243
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.850
March 13th on the security forces and bodies.

244
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.560
<v 0>So what is this law all about?</v>

245
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:14.340
Basically this law introduced a concept never seen before in Spain,

246
00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:15.690
gradual violence,

247
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.870
but another way we all understand that the police may need to use violence at

248
00:13:18.871 --> 00:13:22.590
some point, unfortunately, many criminals don't listen to reason for that.

249
00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:25.110
The police need to use some force. This is a fact.

250
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.660
Now there is violence and violence,

251
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:31.380
and this is how the principle that the Spanish police has been guided by since

252
00:13:31.381 --> 00:13:33.630
the eighties opportunity, congruence,

253
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.300
proportionality at least possible force was born.

254
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:40.200
That means a Spanish police officer can't hit you unless there is any indication

255
00:13:40.201 --> 00:13:41.100
that you might hit him.

256
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.130
A Spanish cop can't pull out his gun unless there is clear evidence.

257
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:47.880
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

258
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.690
<v 0>In particular,</v>

259
00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:52.170
there is a very specific principle called the operational intervention system.

260
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.630
It consists of the following before using force,

261
00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.480
a policeman has to give you a verbal warning, tell you something like,

262
00:13:57.481 --> 00:13:59.130
please get out of the car. We have to search you.

263
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.020
The next level is hand to hand combat.

264
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.780
If the suspect in question shows signs of being armed,

265
00:14:03.781 --> 00:14:05.880
the policemen may move on to the next level of force.

266
00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:10.140
So-called percussion techniques, battens, extendable bars, or electric tasers.

267
00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:13.410
Finally, as a last resort, if the situation continues to escalate,

268
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.120
the policeman can then use a firearm.

269
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.750
All these principles are taught at the Spanish police Academy for nine months in

270
00:14:18.751 --> 00:14:21.330
that course, techniques are taught as self-defense.

271
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.570
That knee restraint is practiced many times, but it doesn't end here.

272
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:29.130
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

273
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:30.750
<v 0>Example within the Spanish police,</v>

274
00:14:30.751 --> 00:14:33.900
there is a body called the civil guard and this body has its own training

275
00:14:33.901 --> 00:14:34.740
program. Check it out.

276
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:41.070
<v 2>The patio operational intervention plan, and the civil guard is implemented.</v>

277
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:45.030
<v 0>This patio program consists of continuous training for all civil guards.</v>

278
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.210
Every six months, they are required to do special two day courses.

279
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.240
These courses have exercises to improve police techniques.

280
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.500
Things like searching or knee restraints are tested for hours.

281
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:57.320
This has nothing in common with the visits to museums like they're doing in

282
00:14:57.321 --> 00:15:00.290
America. To give you an idea. The obsession with police training in Spain,

283
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.400
reaches extremes.

284
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.943
<v 1>This</v>

285
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:09.850
the interior ministry will provide police and civil guards with almost 1,200

286
00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:10.830
tasers.

287
00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.060
<v 0>Order to use those 1,200 electric guns.</v>

288
00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:16.570
So-called tasers cops are required to take a special clearance course.

289
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.630
That is until they learn how to use a new weapon. They can't use it.

290
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:23.890
What's more,

291
00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.550
I'm going to share with you a very curious detail in those courses where using

292
00:15:27.551 --> 00:15:28.420
tasers are taught.

293
00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:31.870
It is very normal for cops to experience it on their own flesh. I mean,

294
00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.620
they grab a cop between two people and shoot him with a taser shot to see how it

295
00:15:35.621 --> 00:15:37.870
hurts. And I know what a lot of people will be thinking,

296
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.960
especially those who are watching this video from the United States.

297
00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:44.050
Is it really possible to import these policies into the U S police?

298
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:49.420
<v 1>Well.</v>

299
00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.450
<v 0>There's a small detail. Unlike the United States in Spain,</v>

300
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.790
police unions have very little power. Moreover,

301
00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:58.660
some law enforcement agencies like the civil guard are prohibited from joining

302
00:15:58.661 --> 00:15:59.350
any union.

303
00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:02.830
All this has allowed reforms to be implemented almost without any problems.

304
00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.020
It is very likely that in the United States,

305
00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.840
such a move to reform would be much more complicated.

306
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.650
The advantage is that the United States is on the threshold of an election and

307
00:16:11.651 --> 00:16:16.030
protests over the assassination of George Floyd are a very good opportunity to

308
00:16:16.031 --> 00:16:19.750
incorporate the issues of police brutality and appropriate training into the

309
00:16:19.751 --> 00:16:20.584
political debate.

310
00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:25.390
So now the question is over to you.

311
00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:27.400
Do you think the U S Cambra form it's police,

312
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.860
to what extent can you repeat in countries be a model?

313
00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.430
How could this country improve? If it could fix one of its worst problems,

314
00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.010
you can leave me your answer in the comments as always,
