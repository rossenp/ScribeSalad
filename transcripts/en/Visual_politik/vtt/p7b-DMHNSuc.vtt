00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.210
<v 0>This video is made possible by Nord VPN. If you are online,</v>

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.360
you really must be using a VPN. And that's where Nord VPN come.

3
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.543
<v 1>In.</v>

4
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.080
<v 0>It's tempting not to bother and hope for the best,</v>

5
00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:15.620
but really those stories you read about people having their data stolen do

6
00:00:15.621 --> 00:00:18.710
happen. And you don't want to make it that easy for anyone to do that.

7
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.250
But using a VPN offers more than just security, for example,

8
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.030
nor VPN lets you access any of its thousands of servers in different countries

9
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.640
around the globe. So if you've hit the end of your Netflix queue,

10
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.210
simply try changing the location of your server and get access to content

11
00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:35.930
libraries that due to licensing agreements are only available in specific

12
00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:37.850
geographic locations. For example,

13
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.630
most European countries have strong licensing agreements restricting which

14
00:00:41.631 --> 00:00:44.840
soccer matches can be viewed depending on the location of the viewer with Nord

15
00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:48.500
VPN, you can change your country without even moving from your sofa.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.870
Nord VPN is super fast. So watching a video is a breeze, no lag whatsoever.

17
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.320

Android Chrome windows, Linux, and on up to six different devices.

20
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.690
One account also, there are no logs kept at all.

21
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.040
Unlike companies based in the EU or us Nord VPN is based in Panama,

22
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.430
so they don't have to keep logs all great for your privacy.

00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:27.020
to get 70% off a three-year plan with an extra month thrown in for free.

26
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.100
And now let's get into it.

27
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.233
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

28
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.800
<v 0>In 2020,</v>

29
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.640
almost every country in the world is going to suffer a huge recession from the

30
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:44.990
pandemic of the new SaaS coronavirus to where all of them struggle. No,

31
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.740
there is a select club of countries that in principle will benefit and

32
00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:52.040
everything indicates that the biggest winner of this pandemic is going to be

33
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.600
none other than Vietnam.

34
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.820
I know the first word that comes to your mind when you hear Vietnam is war the

35
00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:03.890
Vietnam war in the 1960s,

36
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.340
thousands of young Americans left at this country with their military boots and

37
00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:12.260
rifles. But the story has an ironic twist because now 65 years after all that,

38
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.350
the grandchildren of those young people are returning to Vietnam.

39
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.490
Although this time they are dressed in ties and armed with tablets and laptops.

40
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.510
Yes, friends of visual politic Vietnam is on trend. We could say.

41
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.463
<v 1>It's the new China.</v>

42
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.910
In fact.

43
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.810
<v 0>Many companies that had factories in China already moving much of their business</v>

44
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:36.530
to Vietnam. This process was already happening before the coronavirus hit,

45
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.950
but the pandemic has accelerated this trend and we're not talking about small

46
00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:40.784
businesses, either.

47
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.130
<v 1>Samsung shifts some smartphone production to Vietnam due to coronavirus.</v>

48
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.970
<v 0>And yes,</v>

49
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.750
much of this change is because Vietnam has been one of these countries that have

50
00:02:53.751 --> 00:02:56.210
best managed the pandemic. That's right here on this channel,

51
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.940
we have detailed how countries such as South Korea, Taiwan,

52
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.650
or the Czech Republic could be used as examples of how to manage the pandemic.

53
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.080
Perhaps you haven't heard about Vietnam's progress,

54
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.510
but the truth is they've done surprisingly well.

55
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.520
We're talking about a relatively poor country.

56
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.390
We have more than 95 million inhabitants that shares a border with China.

57
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.610
So how many deaths would you say they've had?

58
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.213
<v 1>Well, the answer.</v>

59
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.980
<v 0>Is zero. Exactly. At the time we're making this video,</v>

60
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.580
Vietnam has not had any deaths from COVID-19. What's more,

61
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.850
one of the videos the government has released about public health information

62
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.860
has gone viral and no wonder people look.

63
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.630
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

64
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.570
<v 0>But this whole story goes far beyond the coronavirus.</v>

65
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.110
Vietnam has been growing and attracting companies for decades. In fact,

66
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.590
here's a very curious fact. Vietnam is a communist dictatorship,

67
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.970
much like China. However,

68
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.540
Vietnamese society is a supporter of the free market in the world.

69
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.580
At least that's what a Pew research center survey carried out in 2015 sets.

70
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.090
And it makes a lot of sense more and more companies are setting up in Vietnam

71
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.840
furniture, clothing, shoe factories, to give you an idea.

72
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.110
One out of every two pairs of Adidas, sneakers are labeled made in Vietnam.

73
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.480
And this is funny because 10 years ago, half of Adidas,

74
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.750
his production was in China. The change has been very rapid.

75
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.080
And I know what many of you are going to tell me, let's see Josh.

76
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.060
That's not necessarily an improvement.

77
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.280
That's just swapping one sweatshop for another.

78
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.880
We all know the textile industry doesn't pay good wages. Look at Bangladesh.

79
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.250
Bangladesh is the Mecca of the fashion industry,

80
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.510
but they have been anchored in poverty for decades. And yes, you're right.

81
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.690
The textile industry is a low value added industry, but unlike Bangladesh,

82
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.670
Vietnam is already starting to make a technology.

83
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.360
Technological products certainly have added value and much higher salaries.

84
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.960
And you'll say made in Vietnam. What kind of technology has made in Vietnam?

85
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.260
Well, for starters, these gauges that many of you will be using right now.

86
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.260
<v 1>Apple is reportedly starting to build some of its AirPods in Vietnam to give you.</v>

87
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:56.910
<v 0>In the last 10 years,</v>

88
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.080
Vietnam's GDP has doubled and this extra cashflow has resulted in real

89
00:05:01.081 --> 00:05:04.200
improvements for the lives of all the Vietnamese. As an example,

90
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.130
unlike the Chinese 97% of Vietnamese have health coverage,

91
00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.900
it is true that wages are still low,

92
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.590
but it is also true that there is official protective housing and all sorts of

93
00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:14.850
programs to reduce poverty

94
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.300
Cities like [inaudible] city or so I've gone have impressive skylines filled

95
00:05:21.301 --> 00:05:22.110
with skyscrapers.

96
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.710
And even the slums have much better infrastructure than other countries like

97
00:05:25.711 --> 00:05:29.640
Bangladesh or India. So the question is what's going on in Vietnam?

98
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.240
How is it possible that a country that was once at war with the United States

99
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.790
has integrated so well into the world's market?

100
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.060
How is it possible that they will benefit so greatly from the Corona virus

101
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.830
today? We're going to answer these questions,

102
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.390
but first let's look at some history.

103
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.040
<v 1>Good morning, Vietnam.</v>

104
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.540
<v 0>Few walls have inspired more movies and more songs than the Vietnam war.</v>

105
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.050
We've all seen apocalypse. Now we've listened to Creedence Clearwater revival.

106
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.100
And if you haven't,

107
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.910
I honestly don't know what you're doing with your life seriously. Yet.

108
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.070
All of that is coming from the American view of the war.

109
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.150
What I'm sure you don't know so well is how the Vietnamese lived during and

110
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.380
after the war. And believe me,

111
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.190
it's a much sadder story than any non movie you've already seen whilst it's true

112
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:13.580
that Vietnam won the war. The country was completely destroyed

113
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.180
Between 1 million and 3 million Vietnamese lost their lives.

114
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.270
And unlike world war II, Vietnam had no martial plan.

115
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.270
Obviously the U S wasn't going to help them rebuild. By that time,

116
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.720
the Soviet union had more important things to worry about than a country that

117
00:06:31.721 --> 00:06:34.210
they hardly knew was on the map to make matters worse.

118
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.750
The Vietnamese government was not exactly an example of responsible management.

119
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:38.170
Oh,

120
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.010
men had died during the war and his success has made even Stalin looked like a

121
00:06:42.011 --> 00:06:45.250
moderate politician to give you an idea within just a few years,

122
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.400
the Vietnamese communist party expropriated all farmland,

123
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.350
and it put more than 250,000 South Vietnamese in reeducation camps,

124
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.360
But it doesn't invent.

125
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.750
Many of you probably think that all communist countries get along right. Well,

126
00:07:01.751 --> 00:07:05.140
you're wrong. During the 1980s, Vietnam and Cambodia went to war.

127
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.280
Cambodia was supported by China. Basically China ended up attacking Vietnam.

128
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.970
In other words, it was as if the war with the United States was not enough.

129
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.180
The Vietnamese suffered two Wars for the price of one. As you can imagine,

130
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.580
by 1986, the country was a real echo,

131
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.700
homo fat in hyperinflation and extreme poverty.

132
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.150
And that's when the communist party convened a meeting. As with China,

133
00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.700
the younger politicians told the older ones, this.

134
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.830
<v 2>We have made mistakes due to leftist and frontalis ism idealism.</v>

135
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.130
These mistakes were manifested in maintaining the bureaucracy centralized

136
00:07:39.131 --> 00:07:40.930
mechanism of economic management,

137
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.510
true wrong chin Vietnamese communist politician.

138
00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.590
<v 0>This is how the DOI program was born. The great Vietnamese reform.</v>

139
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.860
Basically the DOJ was something similar to the opening of China,

140
00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:55.210
but on steroids, unlike China, Vietnam did not make special economic zones.

141
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.340
They made it national. And in 10 years,

142
00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:01.150
they changed the whole country from top to bottom, to give you an idea in 1986,

143
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.110
having a company, even if it was a family farm was forbid 10 years later,

144
00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.710
Nike was already opening its first factories on Vietnamese soil.

145
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.650
And I know what you're thinking, right? We've seen this story before.

146
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.320
Basically it's the same thing that happened in China. Isn't it?

147
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.780
What makes Vietnam so special? Let's look at that right now.

148
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.100
<v 1>Like trainer, but with low Tara.</v>

149
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.440
<v 0>If you have a company I want to open a factory.</v>

150
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.650
Vietnam has two unbeatable advantages over China,

151
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.530
lower salaries and a younger population. We have already explained this.

152
00:08:32.531 --> 00:08:33.341
In other videos,

153
00:08:33.341 --> 00:08:38.260
the one child policy in China has resulted in a very lopsided aging society in

154
00:08:38.261 --> 00:08:39.700
Vietnam. They did the opposite.

155
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.150
The government gave all kinds of aid for families that have many children as a

156
00:08:43.151 --> 00:08:46.600
result, almost all Vietnamese are of working age. Meanwhile,

157
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:50.410
North of the border, Chinese salaries are getting higher. For example, today,

158
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.020
a Shinzen worker is paid equivalent to one in hungry.

159
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.280
<v 1>So.</v>

160
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.140
<v 0>What usually happens in these cases? Well,</v>

161
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.760
China specializes in higher value added tasks that is they start producing their

162
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:05.880
own smartphones. There are drones and their own electric cars,

163
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.360
things that require workers with education and the more mechanical jobs are

164
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:12.360
outsourced to Vietnam. That explains news headlines like.

165
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.223
<v 1>This.</v>

166
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:19.040
<v 2>Yarn giant tech song to invest $500 million in Vietnam.</v>

167
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.180
<v 0>Exactly. The first step in Vietnam's development was to become China's China.</v>

168
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.420
At this point, this was not anything that we hadn't seen in other countries.

169
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:31.100
However things changed in 2018, specifically on the 5th of July, 2018.

170
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.100
<v 2>Trump's trade war with China is officially underway.</v>

171
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.490
<v 0>That's when Trump started putting tariffs on Chinese products,</v>

172
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.240
China responded with more tariffs on us products. And in the meantime,

173
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.810
many companies that had factories on Chinese soil started to wonder,

174
00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.960
where else could we go? And the answer was crystal clear, Vietnam.

175
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.550
It's right next door to China. In fact,

176
00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.240
many companies have circumvented the U S tariffs by exporting goods from

177
00:09:56.241 --> 00:09:57.074
Vietnam.

178
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:01.500
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

179
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.080
<v 0>You, you're a Chinese steel producer.</v>

180
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.660
If you send steel beams directly to the United States,

181
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:09.890
you have to pay a 25% tariff, but there's a loophole you can send the beans do.

182
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.730
Haiphong port you relabel your goods made in Vietnam and Hey Presto,

183
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.700
you can ship it to Los Angeles. Duty-free of course this practice,

184
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.220
what is known as trans shipping is beginning to be bad,

185
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.950
but many exporters have been taking advantage of this loophole.

186
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.410
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

187
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:28.130
<v 0>Cheating aside.</v>

188
00:10:28.130 --> 00:10:32.180
There are also many legitimate businesses that are beginning to see Vietnam as

189
00:10:32.181 --> 00:10:35.180
their new China. And we're not talking about shoe factories anymore.

190
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.100
We're talking about much more important.

191
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:42.420
<v 1>Googled it.</v>

192
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.350
<v 2>Shift pixel smartphone production from China to Vietnam.</v>

193
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.770
<v 0>Of course, this is not the first smartphone factory to be set up in Vietnam.</v>

194
00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:52.850
Nakia had factories there for years, but this is just one example, Samsung,

195
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.640
Apple, and many other companies are already doing the same thing.

196
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.190
Vietnamese mobile phone brands are even emerging,

197
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.730
even more in their favorite is the fact that Vietnam has many political

198
00:11:01.731 --> 00:11:02.540
advantages.

199
00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.630
In a way we could say that they are in the same place that China was before

200
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.380
using ping arrived a country that is increasingly opening up to the world.

201
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.000
A communist dictatorship. Yes,

202
00:11:11.001 --> 00:11:13.820
but where almost all decisions are made in a collective manner.

203
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:18.583
<v 1>Or if you like.</v>

204
00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.230
<v 0>G Jinping is China's most undisputed leader.</v>

205
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.870
He has almost unlimited power in Vietnam.

206
00:11:23.871 --> 00:11:27.050
There is a general secretary of the communist party, a prime minister,

207
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.450
a party president, and a communist assembly.

208
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.460
Of course they all belong to the same party,

209
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.310
but some are controlling the others. It's still a dictatorship,

210
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.830
but a much softer one than China's. And that shows.

211
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:41.120
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

212
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.260
<v 0>Vietnamese. People can watch YouTube videos. Obviously many videos are censored,</v>

213
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:49.130
but the platform is totally legal. What's more, there are Vietnamese YouTubers,

214
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.130
probably even this video will be able to be viewed in Vietnam.

215
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.500
The same goes for Facebook, Google,

216
00:11:53.501 --> 00:11:55.570
and any other internet company can give you an idea.

217
00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:59.110
Whilst China is increasingly protectionist, Vietnam is making deals.

218
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:00.023
<v 1>It was like this.</v>

219
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.300
<v 2>Vietnam council gave us final green light to free trade agreements,</v>

220
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:12.180
free trade agreement between the Eurasian economic union and Vietnam to enter

221
00:12:12.181 --> 00:12:14.540
force on October 5th, 2016. But.

222
00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.970
<v 0>This was happening before the pandemic. And we promise that this video,</v>

223
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.960
would it be about how Vietnam is the great beneficiary of the coronavirus?

224
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.790
Right. Well, right now we're going to see.

225
00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:28.590
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

226
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.390
<v 2>The Corona virus winners. We said it.</v>

227
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:31.620
<v 0>At the beginning of this video,</v>

228
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.770
even though it's growing Vietnam is still a poor country.

229
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.680
If China has a per capita income of $20,000,

230
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:40.380
Vietnam is only around $8,600.

231
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:44.280
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

232
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:44.670
<v 0>However,</v>

233
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:48.690
the Vietnamese government has managed to ensure health coverage for 97% of the

234
00:12:48.691 --> 00:12:50.610
population. Because of that, the government,

235
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.490
despite being a dictatorship has been very transparent with everything that it

236
00:12:54.491 --> 00:12:56.730
is linked with the coronavirus from day one,

237
00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.060
they launched all sorts of campaigns to have informed citizens why they had to

238
00:13:00.061 --> 00:13:00.720
wear masks,

239
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.930
the correct method for washing hands and why it was important to stay at home.

240
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.250
Conclusion to date,

241
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:10.080
Vietnam has 334 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and zero

242
00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:13.020
deaths. That's what I said. These results are impressive on their own,

243
00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.390
but considering that they share a border with China,

244
00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:18.600
they are truly worthy of applause, but we're not just talking about health.

245
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.370
We're also talking about economics.

246
00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:26.100
<v 2>Shine up. Plus one strategy could help to keep supply chains robust.</v>

247
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.830
<v 0>Basically if there's one thing that we've learned from the pandemic,</v>

248
00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.040
it's that it's not good to depend on a single country to produce things.

249
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.410
And we're not just talking about mobile phones. For example,

250
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:38.550
95% of the ibuprofen consumed in the United States comes from China.

251
00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.710
It's a similar story with other things like masks.

252
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.370
So when something like a pandemic arrives or the production disappears into thin

253
00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.880
air, we'll explain this further in another video, but stick with this concept,

254
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.390
China plus what that is. Okay. We have a supplier in China,

255
00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.360
but we're going to have another one as a backup in another country,

256
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.480
just in case companies are already taking note. And so on.

257
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.910
<v 2>Japan sets a saves 243.5 billion yen to help firms shift production</v>

258
00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:06.720
out of China.

259
00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.870
<v 0>All of this helps explain why we are seeing so many companies moving part of</v>

260
00:14:09.871 --> 00:14:13.170
their production to Vietnam in 2020, from Google to Microsoft.

261
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.920
If you notice we're no longer talking about Nike or Adidas. In other words,

262
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.440
we're no longer talking about workshops with cheap flavor.

263
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.170
Increasingly we are seeing technology companies,

264
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.380
opening factories in this region. That means better skilled, better patients.

265
00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:26.243
<v 1>Jobs.</v>

266
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:33.090
<v 0>Many of you were thinking, Oh my God, Vietnam is paradise.</v>

267
00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.900
Now all those companies that once went to China are going to go like sheep to

268
00:14:36.901 --> 00:14:39.600
Vietnam. Not really, of course not in principle.

269
00:14:39.601 --> 00:14:42.060
Vietnam still has a lot of problems. Think about it.

270
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.370
China has been the world's factory for decades.

271
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.660
That means that it is currently very easy to find skilled workers there.

272
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.500
People who have studied at universities and who know how to produce high value

273
00:14:51.501 --> 00:14:52.820
added goods. In addition,

274
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.690
China already has luxury infrastructures and suppliers of all kinds.

275
00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.230
Vietnam is many years away from reaching that level. And of course,

276
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.710
other countries like Thailand now also have an opportunity to join the trend.

277
00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:04.490
And other words,

278
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:08.360
Vietnam needs to invest much more in education and building roads. Moreover,

279
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.090
we must not forget that the country is still a dictatorship with all the

280
00:15:11.091 --> 00:15:12.620
political risks that this entails.

281
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:16.670
But right now we can say that while almost every nation is facing a recession,

282
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.610
Vietnam is one of the few exceptions and we'll continue to do.

283
00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:25.930
<v 1>So.</v>

284
00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.660
<v 0>Christian is over to you. Is this going to be Vietnam's decade?</v>

285
00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:32.290
How long will it take before we see Vietnamese tourists walking through our

286
00:15:32.291 --> 00:15:36.580
cities, can Vietnam become a democracy or will they follow in China's footsteps?

287
00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:38.860
You can leave me your answer in the comments. And as always,

288
00:15:38.861 --> 00:15:40.960
