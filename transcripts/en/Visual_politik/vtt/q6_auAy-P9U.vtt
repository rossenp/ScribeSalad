2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.120
grow news is the world's first news comparison platform.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.390
It will let you see how various media have processed information and alert you

4
00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:13.800
to their political point of view.

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.010
This allows you to have a better awareness of what you are reading via a

6
00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:18.210
political spectrum tool.

7
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.140
See the news that you're not seeing ground news is geographic filters.

8
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:25.590
Let you search everything from hyper-local news to global events.

9
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.780
And with all the news stories, breaking up a current events.

10
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:31.230
These days you'll be able to find accurate statistics and reliable facts.

11
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.470
News changes quickly, and the cycles are shorter than ever,

12
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.010
but at ground you can keep track of all the threads concerning your topics of

13
00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:39.870
interest, refresh your memory on stories,

14
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:44.220
or just observe the way the news spirals out. You can also audit your own news.

15
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.390
Yeah, that's right.

16
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.810
They give you a sample of view of who has covered a story and where each outlet

17
00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:50.340
falls on the political spectrum.

18
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.030

21
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.780
now that's out of the way let's get into today's video.

22
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.843
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

23
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.000
<v 0>So my friends are visual politic.</v>

24
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:17.840
When we think of war surely the first images that come to mind for most of us

25
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.160
are of tanks, missiles,

26
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.820
and soldiers with huge automatic weapons and the middle of a battlefield.

27
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.580
Am I wrong? Because I bet I'm not. However,

28
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.630
the truth is that lately things are changing and changing a lot.

29
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.070
This type of war let's call it.

30
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.250
Traditional warfare looks to be in danger of extinction.

31
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.070
At least as far as the superpowers are concerned.

32
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.870
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

33
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.870
<v 0>You see the countries that have historically be most active in the military</v>

34
00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:45.230
field,

35
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.400
such as the United States or Russia are less and less involved in sending huge

36
00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:53.090
contingents abroad to defend their interests. Why? Well,

37
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.930
because this type of operation not only involves an enormous financial cost in

38
00:01:56.931 --> 00:01:59.900
terms of weapons, transport, and all kinds of logistics,

39
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.350
but also has a high cost in terms of human lives,

40
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.750
a factor that is becoming increasingly difficult to,

41
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.680
to exempt because say during world war II or the Korean or Vietnam Wars,

42
00:02:09.681 --> 00:02:14.030
the lives of soldiers were perceived as how should I put this less valuable than

43
00:02:14.031 --> 00:02:16.400
the final objective over time, however,

44
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.170
political and social sensitivity to the massive human cost of war has changed.

45
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.160
And in fact, we can probably say that the Iraq war and the war on terrorism,

46
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.910
where the real.

47
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:26.743
<v 1>Turning points.</v>

48
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.170
<v 0>This video,</v>

49
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.950
we are going to talk about what the near future of war modern warfare might be.

50
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.320
We're talking about special operations.

51
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.370
<v 1>No.</v>

52
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.910
<v 0>What on earth is that? And what do we mean by all this special operations stuff?</v>

53
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:44.450
Well,

54
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.860
let's just say these are those clinical military operations whose objective for

55
00:02:48.861 --> 00:02:51.560
example, is to strengthen or weaken an insurgent movement,

56
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.250
perhaps to bring political and social chaos to an enemy country by attacking key

57
00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:56.450
fingers or infrastructure,

58
00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.030
or to intervene and guerrilla warfare and irregular all of this, of course,

59
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.110
depending on the interests of the power involved. For example,

60
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.830
if it is in the interest of the United States to strengthen a group hostile to

61
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:12.820
the regime of the Iranian Ayatollah is the best way to do so maybe to send a

62
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:16.390
command, a special forces command to support, equip, advise,

63
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.400
and train that group. And this type of operation,

64
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.240
the rule of the conventional army is merely one of support. For example,

65
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.150
if the special forces command has problems and its mission and has to be

66
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.110
assisted or evacuated to the conventional army would intervene at that point.

67
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.920
As long as the problem could not be solved with another special operations team.

68
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.300
But having said that,

69
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.500
which countries can play a relevant rule on a global scale and this increasingly

70
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:43.960
active field of special operations? Well,

71
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.590
surely there are several candidates on the list box, my friends and this video,

72
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.130
we're going to look at the capabilities of three of the major players in this

73
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:54.880
new kind of multilateral cold war that we seem to be starting to have to live

74
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:59.170
with. I'm talking of course about the United States, Russia and China.

75
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.130
So my friends could special operations and unconventional warfare be the future

76
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:06.700
of warfare and even political confrontation. Well, the find out.

77
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.243
<v 1>Get cracking</v>

78
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.790
the elite of elite. Let me.

79
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.460
<v 0>I'll ask you a question. When you think of a military elite,</v>

80
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.860
what is the first thing that comes to mind? But wait,

81
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.430
don't answer that just yet, because I'm almost 100% certain,

82
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.600
it's something very similar to what we're going to see next because yes,

83
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.320
special forces are an essence that small group of super equipped soldiers with

84
00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:36.990
advanced weapons and Nate vision equipment, thermal cameras,

85
00:04:36.991 --> 00:04:40.110
and lots of gadgets that we've all seen at one time or another on the bank,

86
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.860
or if like me, you play video games on lane, the small screen,

87
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.010
they're always the guys who shoot me in the back column running away.

88
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.340
So how does it really all work well to get to know them better?

89
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.400
Let's see what they look like. The United States, special forces commanders,

90
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.100
presumably the best in the field and the whole world

91
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.860
Modern us special forces.

92
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.760
As we know them were created during world war two later while the cold war was

93
00:05:05.761 --> 00:05:07.950
still raging throughout the 1980s and nineties,

94
00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:12.120
the United States employed such commands mainly under the direction of the CIA.

95
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.510
We are talking about commanders who carried out missions of all kinds from

96
00:05:15.511 --> 00:05:19.020
training and supporting what we've become warlords in Afghanistan to fighting

97
00:05:19.021 --> 00:05:22.740
Pablo Escobar's cocktail or the F a R C in Colombia. However,

98
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.840
in 2001 after nine 11,

99
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.780
there was a change in strategy and the special forces began to become

100
00:05:27.781 --> 00:05:30.180
increasingly significant within the army. Hey,

101
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.200
is precisely in this area that the U S special operations command U S UConn

102
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.951
based in Tampa,

103
00:05:34.951 --> 00:05:38.430
Florida is the body tasked with supervising and coordinating the different,

104
00:05:38.431 --> 00:05:42.960
special operations bodies of the army air force Navy and Marine Corps. Today.

105
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.550
It is estimated that the United States has around 70,000 such units of which

106
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.730
about 13,000 are deployed around the world, mostly,

107
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.990
obviously in the middle East,

108
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.720
but also in places as disparate as Latvia and South Korea,

109
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.850
where they train South Korean special forces

110
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.310
And take notes, because if there are no about 70,000 units of this tape,

111
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.850
back in 2001, this figure was just under three.

112
00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.290
That is to put it lightly a wild increase,

113
00:06:14.291 --> 00:06:17.050
which is due to the fact that the Bush administration multiplied and

114
00:06:17.051 --> 00:06:19.330
strengthened the special forces after nine 11,

115
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.240
because they became a key element in the war on terrorism.

116
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.570
This policy was later continued by the following two administrations,

117
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.260
both the Obama administration and the Trump administration.

118
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.900
This is how groups like the Navy seals or Delta force,

119
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.430
which I'm sure you've heard of even if,

120
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.490
only from the movies or from my enrage screaming into my microphone.

121
00:06:36.491 --> 00:06:40.660
When I'm playing on lane have become fundamental pieces of us foreign policy.

122
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.960
Now, the question is, why exactly do they do well?

123
00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.620
These units are employed primarily in the counter terrorism and counter

124
00:06:47.621 --> 00:06:49.510
insurgency missions. For example,

125
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.410
us special forces have done the vast majority of their work fighting ISIS and

126
00:06:53.411 --> 00:06:56.980
Iraq and against Al-Qaeda and Iran. And also in Afghanistan,

127
00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.700
they've also trained Iraqi and Afghan forces to be able to operate effectively

128
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:01.593
on their own.

129
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.380
Their operations are not usually highlighted in the media and in many cases are

130
00:07:05.381 --> 00:07:07.450
not even public knowledge, but without them,

131
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.470
the weakened state of many of these radical groups today would probably not be a

132
00:07:11.471 --> 00:07:14.200
fact, but let's focus on a more concrete case.

133
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.530
I'm sure you all remember the elimination of a Sama bin Laden in Pakistan,

134
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.110
right? Those images went around the world,

135
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:27.070
A Navy seal command composed of two dozen units supported by CIA agents,

136
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.490
landed a helicopter near the house where thanks to intelligence work.

137
00:07:30.491 --> 00:07:34.660
Ben Latin had finally been discovered. The operation was Swift,

138
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.340
a stealthy and organized assault,

139
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.570
neutralizing all defensive targets on ending at last with the iconic leader of

140
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.350
Al-Qaeda. This intervention was textbook. In fact,

141
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:48.370
if one had to define what the modus operandi of a special forces command is,

142
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.350
this operation would be the primary.

143
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.873
<v 1>Exempted.</v>

144
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.940
<v 0>I don't think that this was the only one nor the most top to vote without going</v>

145
00:07:57.941 --> 00:08:00.910
beyond at the beginning of this year, at the beginning of 2020,

146
00:08:00.911 --> 00:08:05.800
the United States carried out yet another disposal operation in Baghdad. Yes,

147
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.380
it seems like years ago. I'm sure you remember.

148
00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:14.500
<v 1>We are indeed.</v>

149
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.710
<v 0>He's talking about the assassination of Iranian general Kasseem stolen money,</v>

150
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.470
which was actually carried out quite differently. For example,

151
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.040
instead of eliminating him by sending a command to physically engage in battle

152
00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:27.280
against him and his gardens on this occasion, a drone was used.

153
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.700
But if you thought that the operation consisted of a simple drone attack,

154
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:33.130
you are very, very wrong. In this case.

155
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:37.450
Us special forces vehicle was following Solomanis convoy very closely before the

156
00:08:37.451 --> 00:08:40.480
attack from the drone. Furthermore, the attack from the drone was successful.

157
00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:44.050
Thanks to the communication between that treeline command and the air force,

158
00:08:44.051 --> 00:08:47.200
which was controlling the aircraft. Are you surprised? Well,

159
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.760
wait and see what comes next.

160
00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:52.570
Because as well as this type of surgical attack to eliminate heads of rebel

161
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.160
groups or key figures,

162
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:58.290
there are other of operations in which special forces are typically very

163
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.760
efficient. We are talking about much riskier operations in which Russia.

164
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.630
Yes,

165
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:08.310
Russia Putin's Russia has demonstrated an amazing and yet highly worrying

166
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:11.430
proficiency. Do you have any idea where this might be headed? Well,

167
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.080
let's push on and find out.

168
00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.360
<v 1>Just silent invasions.</v>

169
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.160
<v 0>That's it, it's something that's and one way or another,</v>

170
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.410
we have already talked about on several occasions,

171
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.150
Russia has developed special forces whose main specialty is silent invasions.

172
00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.840
We are talking about the dreaded Spetsnaz, which with its 3000 units,

173
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:39.560
occasionally metals in Eastern Europe to defend the Russian bears area of

174
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.220
influence.

175
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.150
We are talking about a type of invasion that occurs without anyone noticing it

176
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.860
at first with almost no destruction and without killing almost anyone that's as

177
00:09:48.861 --> 00:09:51.200
long, of course, as they don't get in the way.

178
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.270
Do you want an example of what we are telling you though?

179
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.400
I'm sure you know exactly where we are going,

180
00:09:55.401 --> 00:09:57.980
because we are talking about where else Crimea

181
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.470
Invasion of the Crimean peninsula in 2014 was from a military point of view,

182
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:10.670
practically a historical landmark. Think about it for just one moment,

183
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:11.810
capturing a territory,

184
00:10:11.811 --> 00:10:15.560
almost the same size as Maryland with a little more than 2 million inhabitants

185
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:20.360
without firing a single shot is without a doubt, something impressive suddenly.

186
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.130
And without anyone being able to prevent it,

187
00:10:22.131 --> 00:10:26.360
some mysterious soldiers without flags began to arrive and the Crimea to

188
00:10:26.361 --> 00:10:28.820
well-equipped to be irregular forces or groups of rebels,

189
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:32.120
and who also appeared to have an elite military formation.

190
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:36.170
We are talking about the so-called little green men who appeared overnight and

191
00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:39.470
took control of the key infrastructure in the Crimean region, the media,

192
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.560
all the headquarters of public administrations and short they rapidly took

193
00:10:42.561 --> 00:10:46.040
control of all the relevant enclaves with practically no use.

194
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.023
<v 1>A force.</v>

195
00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.520
<v 0>Quite a different scenario from the Dawn bus. By the way, of course,</v>

196
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.650
all this it must be said,

197
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.660
was done with the logistic and military intelligence support of the conventional

198
00:10:56.661 --> 00:11:00.590
Russian army, which has a Naval base in Sevastopol. The capital of Crimea,

199
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.310
a base that you can see is important because it's the main base of the Russian

200
00:11:04.311 --> 00:11:05.600
fleet and the black sea.

201
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:10.460
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

202
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.290
<v 0>And this is something important to take into account.</v>

203
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.040
According to information that later became known Putin spent weeks sending

204
00:11:16.041 --> 00:11:19.310
reinforcements to Sebastopol reinforcements in the form of ground troops on

205
00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:22.490
standby to act in case things got complicated. You see,

206
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.090
despite what we might think the truth is that the trend in recent years,

207
00:11:26.091 --> 00:11:29.480
for those special bodies to not act in isolation as may have happened in the

208
00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:31.100
seventies, eighties, and nineties,

209
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:34.550
but to act in coordination with conventional armed forces.

210
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.080
That's explains why today,

211
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.350
despite the fact that this new form of targeted warfare seems increasingly

212
00:11:39.351 --> 00:11:40.550
prepared by the superpowers,

213
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.910
it is still necessary for them to expand their military bases and strategic

214
00:11:43.911 --> 00:11:45.350
alliances throughout the world

215
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:50.241
Example.

216
00:11:50.241 --> 00:11:53.410
I'm sure many of you will be aware of the enormous military and territorial

217
00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:54.070
expungement,

218
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.970
but China is pursuing and the countries of Southeast Asia and the famous dispute

219
00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:01.180
regarding the artificial islands of the South China sea. Well,

220
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.160
all of this may have at least in part, an explanation,

221
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:06.100
closely links to what we have just seen.

222
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.200
If you control the territory militarily,

223
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.870
you may be able to also control the States nearby.

224
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.170
Although the Chinese special forces are still in their infancy.

225
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:18.070
The truth is that they have been investing a lot of money and effort since the

226
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:22.180
1990s to bring the elite forces up to the level of the Americans and the

227
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.860
Russians, My friends.

228
00:12:25.861 --> 00:12:28.440
Would you like to know a little bit more about what the future of the people's

229
00:12:28.441 --> 00:12:30.270
liberation army could be? If you do.

230
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:31.583
<v 1>Let's check out</v>

231
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:38.820
three way, future.

232
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:45.810
<v 0>Anything is clear after everything we have told you in this video is that today</v>

233
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.050
the difference between having a good armed forces and an armed force that can be

234
00:12:49.051 --> 00:12:53.640
decisive and influential on a global level lies and its special forces. Yes.

235
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.410
Okay. You can have lots of tanks,

236
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.960
impressive fighter bombers and fleets of frigates,

237
00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:01.980
but which power is willing to use all that force at once.

238
00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:05.160
Do we really need to declare all out war if we can act?

239
00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:09.750
And another way is more discreet quicker and with infinitely less economic and

240
00:13:09.751 --> 00:13:12.090
most importantly human costs. Well,

241
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:15.390
as precisely for all these reasons that the country that is currently making the

242
00:13:15.391 --> 00:13:19.290
most effort to increase its capacity to act with special operations groups is

243
00:13:19.291 --> 00:13:23.010
none other than the Chinese Tatum. China has built not one,

244
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.740
but several special operations forces and facts,

245
00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:29.400
each defense group into which the army is divided as its own elite unit.

246
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.370
And in this case, unlike the United States and Russia,

247
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.040
there is no single command at the moment,

248
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.130
but do you want some concrete examples? If you do check.

249
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.173
<v 1>This ain't.</v>

250
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.820
<v 0>The Navy has the giant long unit meaning sea dragon,</v>

251
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:48.750
which was created in 2002 and among other missions recovered a cargo ship

252
00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.390
hijacked by Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden.

253
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.300
Another example of Chinese special forces as the least Shen unit,

254
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:55.770
which is part of the air force.

255
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.040
The curious thing about this paratrooper command is that it came to receive

256
00:13:59.041 --> 00:14:02.340
training at the military Academy of the Boulevard and national guard of

257
00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:05.790
Venezuela, a training that was intended to improve their ability to fight.

258
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.300
<v 1>Into junk. Anyway.</v>

259
00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:09.900
<v 0>Well,</v>

260
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.930
one like best to list at least 15 different special forces units within the

261
00:14:12.931 --> 00:14:14.400
Chinese people's liberation army.

262
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:18.180
Each of the forces specializing in a different area at present is not known how

263
00:14:18.181 --> 00:14:19.890
many soldiers compromise these units,

264
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.550
but it is estimated to be between 7,000 and 14,000. Yes,

265
00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:27.360
that does seem like a far cry from the 70,000 to trained and equipped units that

266
00:14:27.361 --> 00:14:28.500
make up the U S Corps,

267
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:32.400
but also many more than the barely 3000 soldiers that U S handled at the

268
00:14:32.401 --> 00:14:34.440
beginning of the century. In other words,

269
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:37.380
the difference is much less than we might think at first school

270
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.000
And my friends, if China manages to fully develop this new capacity,

271
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:46.740
we could be facing a new paradigm,

272
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.370
a scenario in which the three major superpowers would be able to intervene in

273
00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:55.100
complex operations operations that could influence the future of many countries,

274
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:57.770
their internal politics that could remove and establish governments,

275
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.160
feed rebel groups, and a Marriott of other actions of all Kings.

276
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:05.210
But hold on one moment, if this type of intervention becomes widespread,

277
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.660
how far could it go with the governments of Russia and China have any scruples

278
00:15:08.661 --> 00:15:11.960
about meddling in countries allied with the United States or even an advanced

279
00:15:11.961 --> 00:15:14.000
democracies to fool conflicts of all kinds.

280
00:15:14.001 --> 00:15:16.610
Could this end up triggering a clash between the great powers.

281
00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:21.340
<v 1>Take notes?</v>

282
00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:25.150
<v 0>Because there are experts who even argue having tens and tens of thousands of</v>

283
00:15:25.151 --> 00:15:26.980
operatives prepared to act continuously.

284
00:15:26.981 --> 00:15:30.400
And these types of covert operations could become a risk to international

285
00:15:30.401 --> 00:15:34.450
security attain bomb of future conflicts on a massive scale,

286
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:38.320
undoubtedly as is always the case. New strategies typically bring benefits,

287
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.910
also risks that we cannot ignore. But having said that it is now over to you.

288
00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.210
Do you believe that the indiscriminate use of special forces for missions abroad

289
00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:50.080
as a beneficial opportunity, or is that a risk to global security?

290
00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.150
And as we asked you at the beginning of this video,

291
00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.030
do you think this could be the future of armed confrontation?
