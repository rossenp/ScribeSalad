00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.330
<v 0>This video is made possible by Nord VPN. If you're online,</v>

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.900
you really must be using a VPN. And that's where naughty VPN comes in.

3
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.480
I know it's tempting not to bother and hope for the best,

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.020
but really those stories you read about people having their data stolen do

5
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:18.870
happen. And you don't want to make it easy for anyone to do that.

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.530
But using a VPN offers more than just security. For example,

7
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.700
Nord VPN lets you access any of its thousands of servers in different countries,

8
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.460
all around the globe. So if you've hit the end of your Netflix queue,

9
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.910
simply try changing the location of your server and get access to content

10
00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:36.450
libraries that due to licensing agreements are only available in specific

11
00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:38.460
geographic locations. For example,

12
00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:42.000
most European countries have strong licensing agreements restricting which

13
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:45.450
soccer matches can be viewed depending on the location of the viewer with a Nord

14
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:48.810
VPN, you can change your country without even moving from your sofa.

15
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.720
No VPN is super fast. So watching a video is a breeze,

16
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.040
no lag whatsoever. If you've ever used a VPN and thought they were slow, well,

One account also there are no logs kept at hall.

21
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.470

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.250
So they don't have to keep logs at all. Great for your privacy.

29
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.963
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

30
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.410
<v 0>When we think of Germany and try to do a mind map of what this country is like</v>

31
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:04.220
and how it works. Most of us probably think of a very cohesive territory,

32
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.430
a country where the economy is doing well and where prosperity reaches

33
00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:12.230
practically every corner, a real superpower in short, the powerhouse of Europe,

34
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.100
a country whose problem seems small compared to those we can find in other parts

35
00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:17.360
of the old continent. Well,

36
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.440
friends hope that fault because the truth is that this is not the real story or

37
00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:25.700
rather Germany is not exactly like that. At least not completely. You see,

38
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.100
although the division of Germany into two parts,

39
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.180
a capitalist West and a communist East formally ended on the 3rd of October,

40
00:02:32.181 --> 00:02:35.900
1990, following the fall of the wall in November, 1989,

41
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.930
the country is still somewhat divided. Believe it or not,

42
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.890
we can still observe the existence of two great blocks. Yes, that's right.

43
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.030
We have not gone mad.

44
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.490
You could say that there is an invisible wall that divides two quite different

45
00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.500
Germany's in this video, we're going to give you all the details. Friends,

46
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.770
the former territories of the German democratic Republic presents some

47
00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:58.610
surprising and profound differences to those of the former federal Republic of

48
00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:00.040
Germany that even today,

49
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.580
30 years after reunification have not been completely sorted out.

50
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.470
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

51
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.300
<v 0>Let's start the story from the very beginning,</v>

52
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.480
after being politically divided since 1945,

53
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.230
the communist government of East Germany closed the borders with the West in

54
00:03:16.231 --> 00:03:17.190
1952,

55
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.970
the only exception that allowed relative freedom in moving from East to West was

56
00:03:20.971 --> 00:03:24.210
Berlin. However, some years later in 1961,

57
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.070
the communist government of the GDR,

58
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.850
the German democratic Republic in view of a high number of defections that were

59
00:03:29.851 --> 00:03:32.940
occurring, built the infamous Berlin wall since then,

60
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.810
the historic capital of the German empire became the living representation of a

61
00:03:36.811 --> 00:03:40.770
division that conditioned politics of the whole world for decades,

62
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.830
East versus West capitalism versus communism,

63
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.990
NATO versus the Warsaw pact.

64
00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.740
And not only that that's physical border then extended throughout Germany in

65
00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:52.560
some areas in the form of a wall and in others of fences,

66
00:03:52.561 --> 00:03:55.080
surrounded with watchtowers and armed soldiers.

67
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.530
And it was no bluff because the soldiers deployed on the border had a clear

68
00:03:58.531 --> 00:04:01.920
order shoots to kill anyone who tried to escape in some places.

69
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.210
The separation consisted of double Gates with central areas full of concertina

70
00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:07.044
wire. In fact,

71
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.680
almost one and a half million anti-personnel mines were laid along the border.

72
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.300
We're talking about a division,

73
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.980
a mutual isolation that contributed to creating an economic political and above

74
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.880
all a social wound, a wound that would Mark the future right up to them.

75
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.013
<v 1>Today.</v>

76
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.680
<v 0>Think about it for a moment overnight 44,000 soldiers from the German democratic</v>

77
00:04:28.681 --> 00:04:31.620
Republic were given the mission of keeping the German people apart.

78
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.350
Their motto was to avoid any contact between the two sides.

79
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.570
Evidently since then, even beyond the ideological question,

80
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.720
the puffs that both countries followed in all orders were very,

81
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.070
very different over time.

82
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.130
The existence of these two Germany's generated important differences,

83
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.060
not only in terms of economic development levels, but also in social terms,

84
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.290
friends in this video,

85
00:04:55.291 --> 00:04:58.530
we're going to try and look at the differences that even today,

86
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.030
30 years after reunification are still visible and that continue to condition

87
00:05:03.031 --> 00:05:07.230
the political, social and economic reality of the new unified Germany.

88
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.730
<v 1>Unfinished reunification.</v>

89
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.580
<v 0>No secret just as destroying is much easier than building.</v>

90
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.480
So is separating much easier than putting back together in the case of Germany,

91
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.190
which is the subject of this video,

92
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.880
the differences and peculiarities between both parts of the formerly divided

93
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.760
Germany remained to this day. And even beyond the economy,

94
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.210
perhaps the most difficult thing to equalize and integrate is precisely their

95
00:05:39.211 --> 00:05:40.320
different societies

96
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.870
In social and political terms.

97
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.500
There are important differences between the two former German republics.

98
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.180
And although it may seem surprising,

99
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.650
there is even mistrust and suspicion between East and West Germany, for example,

100
00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.500
many Germans from the former few underrepresented in political and judicial

101
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:02.540
institutions and positions, fuss,

102
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.390
fueling a certain feeling of inequality to give you an example,

103
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.800
eight out of 10 judges and prosecutors in the East grew up in the West and no

104
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:13.580
major listed company in the country is based in the East, outside Berlin,

105
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:18.050
nor are there any of the large research development and innovation centers that

106
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.370
underpinned the competitiveness of large tonic companies located in this part of

107
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:23.204
the country.

108
00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.650
There are even clearly marked political boundaries. In fact,

109
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.100
using the election results of the right-wing populist party alternative for

110
00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:37.000
Germany and to the socialist de-linking, which translates as the left.

111
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.730
We could almost perfectly draw the border between these two.

112
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.650
And not only that, if we look concretely at the city of Berlin,

113
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.860
you can see that the areas where these two parties reap the most support

114
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.860
correspond exactly to what was once East Berlin,

115
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.120
the side that was under communist control. And the obvious question is why,

116
00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.680
what explains such a difference?

117
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.890
What is behind these differences that even determined voting preferences?

118
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.110
Well friends, the truth is that in general,

119
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.250
Germans from these two sides still maintain different ways of seeing society and

120
00:07:09.251 --> 00:07:12.670
understanding concrete aspect of politics. An example, well,

121
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.630
without digging too deep, let's take immigration and that is look closely at it.

122
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:25.300
The success of alternative for Germany in the East has a lot to do with the

123
00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:27.940
rejection of Angela Merkel's refugee policies,

124
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.780
which have seen the country open its doors to nearly a million people since

125
00:07:31.781 --> 00:07:32.560
2015.

126
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.310
And it makes sense after all East Germany has never traditionally been a place

127
00:07:36.311 --> 00:07:37.060
of immigration.

128
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.720
So many East Germans view this influx with suspicion and distrust,

129
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.600
that is you may be more or less in favor of this type of policy,

130
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.270
but when you have not had any previous experience,

131
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.870
the fear rejection suspicion is usually much.

132
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:49.743
<v 1>Great, sir.</v>

133
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.230
<v 0>But in the East, unemployment is somewhat higher and the wages are lower.</v>

134
00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.520
So that anti-immigration,

135
00:07:57.521 --> 00:08:00.850
and even anti-European discourse has a better breeding ground.

136
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.960
The vast majority of Germans consider their lives to have improved since

137
00:08:07.961 --> 00:08:08.770
reunification.

138
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.100
It is precisely the East Germans who consider themselves to have benefited the

139
00:08:12.101 --> 00:08:15.520
most. I'm sure this is something that doesn't surprise you in the least.

140
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:16.300
In fact,

141
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.020
East Germans who currently rate their quality of life seven or higher have could

142
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.700
report between 1991 and 2019 reaching 59% of the total

143
00:08:24.701 --> 00:08:25.120
group.

144
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.300
But hold on a moment just because things have improved does not mean that the

145
00:08:28.301 --> 00:08:30.070
differences have completely disappeared.

146
00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.130
German cohesion is not coming as quickly as was fought.

147
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.400
And now it is clear that the 20 year period that was initially estimated for

148
00:08:36.401 --> 00:08:39.400
handling this was far too short. Of course, at this point,

149
00:08:39.401 --> 00:08:41.620
I'm sure many of you were thinking, but Josh,

150
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:45.490
what exactly are these economic differences that are hidden behind this kind of

151
00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:49.000
invisible wall and how do they stay hidden? Well, let's take a look.

152
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.310
<v 1>One Germany, two speeds, friends.</v>

153
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:03.200
<v 0>It's a cool field is not the only area where we can find a Bismal differences</v>

154
00:09:03.201 --> 00:09:06.530
between the two Germany's. The economy also shows a similar phenomenon,

155
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.250
obviously moving overnight from a socialist economy where everything belongs to

156
00:09:10.251 --> 00:09:13.040
the state and there is no private property to the capitalist.

157
00:09:13.041 --> 00:09:17.270
One is not always easy or rather it is not always so easy to close the gap and

158
00:09:17.271 --> 00:09:21.110
even more so when one of the sides was three or four times poorer than the other

159
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:26.600
after reunification, less than 10% of Eastern businesses operated at a profit,

160
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:29.930
most of the new companies were not up to the standards of the Western market.

161
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.880
DIW German Institute for economic reasons. Note that in 1991,

162
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.660
East Germany had a GDP per capita, three times lower than the West.

163
00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:42.140
And its citizens had an annual gross income, 50% below that,

164
00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:43.550
of their Western compatriots.

165
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:47.330
And although those differences have since narrowed substantially 30 years on

166
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.100
full alignment has still not been yet.

167
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.053
<v 1>The chief.</v>

168
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:58.280
<v 0>The GDP per capita in the East is still 30% lower than in the West annual</v>

169
00:09:58.281 --> 00:10:02.150
household. Incomes are almost 20% lower. A difference that is even greater.

170
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.490
If we exclude the public sector, in addition,

171
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:08.750
unemployment is higher and the Eastern Landers income is no more than

172
00:10:08.751 --> 00:10:10.730
60% of the federal average.

173
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:15.560
What's more an adult in the West has an average net worth of 120,000 euros,

174
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:19.610
which is more than double the average of 55,000 euros in the East of Germany.

175
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:20.390
In addition,

176
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.930
the reversal of the population pyramid is much more pronounced because many

177
00:10:23.931 --> 00:10:28.340
young people have moved West the flow of investment and capital into the former

178
00:10:28.341 --> 00:10:32.360
German democratic Republic was immense, but people went in the other direction,

179
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.210
the children who should have been born there are not there. Christina Von duvet,

180
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.850
DIW economist. You see, no matter how you look at it, there are differences.

181
00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.660
And surprisingly,

182
00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.930
there are some very particular things in the East as are actually better than in

183
00:10:44.931 --> 00:10:48.050
the West. For example, the infrastructure. Yes, that's right.

184
00:10:48.051 --> 00:10:50.870
I have not mixed these two things up. It's better in the East.

185
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.270
You see when the two sides were first reunited,

186
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.840
the socialist zone of the GDR had a huge lack of modern freeways.

187
00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.680
The railroads were basically obsolete and basically all the transport networks

188
00:11:00.681 --> 00:11:01.514
were defeated

189
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:06.710
Mostly because of this.

190
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.490
And to change this outlook West Germany embarked on a multi-million dollar

191
00:11:10.491 --> 00:11:14.150
investment program in the East paid for by the taxes of the Germans of the

192
00:11:14.151 --> 00:11:17.540
former federal Republic of Germany. And also with European funds,

193
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:22.280
the result was the building and reconstruction of 2000 kilometers of new main

194
00:11:22.281 --> 00:11:22.700
roads.

195
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.930
And they completely renovated railroad network for which some 30 billion euros

196
00:11:26.931 --> 00:11:30.020
was invested. The checkbook, the German politicians pulled out.

197
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:33.390
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

198
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.950
<v 0>Of course, such an act of generosity was not without controversy.</v>

199
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.860
As all these investments were made. The former West Germany,

200
00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:44.090
the epicenter of Teutonic competitiveness and wealth fell behind to the point

201
00:11:44.091 --> 00:11:45.740
where it had worse infrastructure,

202
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.700
especially railroads than in the East of the country where brand new ones had

203
00:11:49.701 --> 00:11:52.520
just been built. In fact, if you travel through Eastern Germany,

204
00:11:52.521 --> 00:11:56.050
you will see for yourself how many train stations are much more modern than

205
00:11:56.051 --> 00:11:56.980
those in the West.

206
00:11:56.981 --> 00:12:00.670
While the road infrastructure is also better planned and organized as well as

207
00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:03.310
being in better shape. This is something that by the way,

208
00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.710
causes resentment amongst Western Germans,

209
00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.290
who are after all the ones who paid for it all,

210
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.290
but why undertake such a large investment in infrastructure?

211
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:16.380
<v 1>See.</v>

212
00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.250
<v 0>Fundamental idea in addition to uniting the territory was to facilitate the</v>

213
00:12:20.251 --> 00:12:24.000
industrialization of the former communist Republic and thus reduce the

214
00:12:24.001 --> 00:12:28.110
differences between the two sites in economic terms, production and wages,

215
00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.200
something that has more or less been achieved. Okay. Not quite,

216
00:12:31.201 --> 00:12:33.150
but at least it's something on the other hand,

217
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:37.170
the main problem just before reunification was what to do with the huge

218
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.910
practically inoperative and very unproductive public enterprises in the GDR

219
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.420
here,

220
00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.470
the only solution was to initiate a process of privatization that was by no

221
00:12:46.471 --> 00:12:47.580
means an easy task.

222
00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:50.970
And that had been ordered by the government of the GDR just before its

223
00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:55.320
extinction through the so-called Troy [inaudible] or trust agency

224
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.520
Agency was a body created in 1990 by the East German council of ministers and

225
00:13:05.521 --> 00:13:07.470
was operational until 1994.

226
00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.550
Its aim and function was to privatize or sell the more than 8,000 public

227
00:13:11.551 --> 00:13:13.290
enterprises of socialist Germany,

228
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.750
which employed almost 4 million people at the time.

229
00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.320
The challenge they faced was the difficulty in placing all these companies and

230
00:13:19.321 --> 00:13:20.940
their assets in the market. Why?

231
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.780
Because these massive and inefficient organizations were mostly oriented to

232
00:13:24.781 --> 00:13:26.160
trade with the communist block.

233
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:30.090
And many of their factories also had obsolete machinery that did not meet

234
00:13:30.091 --> 00:13:31.830
Western standards. And of course,

235
00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.380
as the communist block was in a state of full collapse,

236
00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:37.710
the turnover of these companies plummeted to such an extent that they were

237
00:13:37.711 --> 00:13:42.060
plunged into a deep crisis at which point, the idea of ever becoming profitable,

238
00:13:42.061 --> 00:13:44.430
again seemed a Miraj. Therefore,

239
00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.150
one of the solutions they came up with was to divide some companies into smaller

240
00:13:48.151 --> 00:13:51.960
entities to facilitate the access of small investors in the privatization

241
00:13:51.961 --> 00:13:52.794
process.

242
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.830
That was not the only thing the trust agency did to prepare the country for

243
00:13:58.831 --> 00:13:59.880
total annexation,

244
00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:04.170
about 2.5 million hectares or almost 6.2 million acres of

245
00:14:04.171 --> 00:14:08.550
agricultural land for privatized properties of the ministry of state security

246
00:14:08.551 --> 00:14:12.450
were sold as well as army property and assets of the official political parties.

247
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.040
In any case, despite the problems,

248
00:14:14.041 --> 00:14:17.910
the result was that many West German companies ended up buying all or parts of

249
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.000
East German companies who've established branches or production sites,

250
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.850
their first take advantage of lower wage costs.

251
00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.380
<v 1>And this was good.</v>

252
00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.890
<v 0>In the sense that a lot of jobs were preserved and production was secured.</v>

253
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.940
The only drawback for the future was that these regions subsequently specialized

254
00:14:35.941 --> 00:14:39.660
in the lover value, added production and assembly phases. In other words,

255
00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:41.700
the most qualified workers who research,

256
00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:45.960
invent and create value stayed in the West whilst just some of those factories

257
00:14:45.961 --> 00:14:50.010
of those products were moved to the East to further illustrate this in 2016,

258
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.060
400,000 from the East migrated to the West,

259
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.930
while only 150,000 Germans from the West migrated to the East.

260
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.130
This is something that over time has perpetuated the differences in income and

261
00:15:01.131 --> 00:15:04.220
wages between Germans in the East and West of the country.

262
00:15:04.221 --> 00:15:08.600
And obviously also the GDP of the new and old Landers in any case.

263
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:12.170
It also must be said that the progress that has been made is remarkable.

264
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:13.100
Of course now,

265
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.880
as you can imagine to balance the country as poor as the GDR with an industrial

266
00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:17.780
and economic power,

267
00:15:17.781 --> 00:15:21.380
like the FRG was far from cheap infrastructure levels of wellbeing,

268
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.070
reconstruction of the productive fabric remodeling of the cities, et cetera,

269
00:15:25.071 --> 00:15:27.170
et cetera. So the question that comes up is,

270
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.920
but really how much has this whole process cost? Do you want to know the answer?

271
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:31.813
Well.

272
00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:44.770
<v 1>The price of division friends.</v>

273
00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.180
<v 0>No mistake, the German reunification has been and remains a very,</v>

274
00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.700
very expensive experiment. Hold onto your chair.

275
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:56.290
According to estimates by the whole Institute for economic research between 1990

276
00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.670
and 2009 alone,

277
00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:02.680
the former capitalist FRG spent more than 1.3 trillion euros trillion

278
00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.580
to subsidize the economic and social convergence of the former GDR.

279
00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:07.443
To give you an idea,

280
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.140
this is almost double the entire recovery fund approved by the European

281
00:16:11.141 --> 00:16:14.800
commission to deal with the coronavirus crisis. And that's not the end of it.

282
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:19.330
It is estimated that billions still flow from the West every year, every year.

283
00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:21.520
Now, what has all this money been spent on?

284
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:24.190
And how has all this spending been financed? Well,

285
00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.580
here comes another somewhat controversial story because much of that money was

286
00:16:27.581 --> 00:16:31.690
spent for very different purposes than originally intended something that those

287
00:16:31.691 --> 00:16:35.350
in the West did not find very funny. I'm basically referring to social service.

288
00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.000
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

289
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.180
<v 0>Although the initial investment was aimed at improving the competitiveness of</v>

290
00:16:43.181 --> 00:16:46.480
the East. For example, by promoting the modernization of companies,

291
00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:49.780
it has been calculated that a large part of the funds have gone to other

292
00:16:49.781 --> 00:16:53.830
purposes, such as social benefits, retirement, pensions, subsidies,

293
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:58.060
and aid of all claims in short, a lot of handouts were given to the citizens.

294
00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:01.570
This is a handy carrot for any politician who aspires to win votes,

295
00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.530
but in practice,

296
00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.770
it does not create any productive structure that will serve to improve

297
00:17:05.771 --> 00:17:09.100
sustainability, autonomy and living conditions in the future.

298
00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:13.690
And of course,

299
00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:17.260
those in the West of Germany began to complain and rightly so that their

300
00:17:17.261 --> 00:17:21.550
compatriots in the East were becoming dependent on these handouts at the expense

301
00:17:21.551 --> 00:17:25.780
of companies and taxpayers in the West sanctions were even demanded for Eastern

302
00:17:25.781 --> 00:17:29.080
Landers who did not spend the money properly. This was never enforced.

303
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:32.710
The point is that they have many reasons to be angry because a good part of the

304
00:17:32.711 --> 00:17:36.850
money that Eastern Germany has received since 1995 has been financed by a

305
00:17:36.851 --> 00:17:40.600
solidarity tax or rather a surcharge popularly known as the soul.

306
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:45.670
Well, this surcharge,

307
00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.250
the Sali has collected 331 billion euros since its creation in

308
00:17:50.251 --> 00:17:51.270
1995,

309
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:56.250
through a 5.5% surcharge added to or income tax capital gains tax

310
00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.280
and corporate tax payments above a certain income threshold.

311
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.560
According to the calculations of the Frankfurter,

312
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.480
Allgemeine those items without this tax,

313
00:18:03.481 --> 00:18:05.610
the average income would save about 900 yeah.

314
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.823
<v 2>Euros a year.</v>

315
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.620
<v 0>Something that those in the West will experience soon as it is a tax that will</v>

316
00:18:12.621 --> 00:18:13.880
disappear in 2020.

317
00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.740
<v 2>German government moves to end solidarity tax for Eastern Germany.</v>

318
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:23.000
<v 0>So there you have it. German reunification has cost a lot of money.</v>

319
00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:24.980
Yet there are still important economic,

320
00:18:24.981 --> 00:18:29.180
political and social differences today that invisible wall that separates the

321
00:18:29.181 --> 00:18:31.730
East from the West still seems very much in place.

322
00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.420
And you can also see how it is much easier to divide them put back together.

323
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:37.310
But having said that, it's your turn.

324
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:40.850
