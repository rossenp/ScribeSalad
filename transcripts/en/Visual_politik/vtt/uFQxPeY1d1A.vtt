1
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.220
<v 1>Take a look at the t-shirt you're wearing or your jeans,</v>

2
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.560
or even the money you have in your pocket. I'm Scottish.

3
00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:14.540
So I don't have any to show you, unfortunately,

4
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.460
but all those things are made of cotton. Yeah. The dollars and Euro bells too.

5
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.090
Well,

6
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.960
I have some bad news to tell you one in five of you maybe wearing a product made

7
00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:25.550
by slave labor, right?

8
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.360
Unfortunately as pure mathematics,

9
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.050
a quarter of all the cotton in the world is produced in China. Within China.

10
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.170
88% of the cotton crops are grown in the yang Jang region.

11
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.300
And if you're a regular follower, visual politic,

12
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.010
you'll be aware of what is happening right now.

13
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.560
And yang discrimination against the younger people,

14
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.310
reeducation camps and forced labor. Okay. Back to the myth,

15
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.730
if a quarter of the world's cotton is produced in China and off this cotton,

16
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.500
88% comes from Jinjiang.

17
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.950
We only have to make the rule of three to find out what percentage of cotton is

18
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.970
produced in this region where the wheat or minority is practically enslaved by

19
00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:02.804
the Chinese.

20
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.680
You don't even have to get out your calculator because I'm going to tell you

21
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.920
it's 22%. Yeah, that's right. 22%,

22
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.030
or just over a fifth of all the world's cotton that we all like so much is the

23
00:01:17.031 --> 00:01:21.860
product of forced labor. And it's used by big brands like H and M Adidas, Ikea,

24
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.090
a Nike. And in case anyone thinks it's not a big deal brace yourselves,

25
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.920
because this is not the worst thing.

26
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.760
China is not the only country that is covering up human rights abuses in cotton

27
00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:32.270
production.

28
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.920
And although it may be hard to believe there is something even worse than forced

29
00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:37.754
labor.

30
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:38.773
<v 0>Check this out.</v>

31
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.090
<v 2>Nimble fingers. Myth is particularly relevant to cotton seed production,</v>

32
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.620
where employers claim that tasks of cross-pollination emasculation and hand

33
00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:56.330
pollination are best undertaken by prepubescent female children as is the case

34
00:01:56.331 --> 00:01:59.510
in India, ILO international labor organization.

35
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.880
<v 1>Yup. That's right. And the 21st century,</v>

36
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.710
there are still producers who publicly argued the benefits of child labor.

37
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.290
Unless we clear, we are not talking about teenagers,

38
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.350
but about children who start work from the age of five,

39
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.650
They're also very often employed to pet cotton because compared to adult

40
00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:23.000
pickers, they have two advantages. One is that because children are shorter,

41
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.070
they don't have to bend down to pick up the cotton.

42
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.420
And two is that they can be paid much, much less than any adult.

43
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.020
So if you are an unscrupulous business person with no government control,

44
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.850
the best thing you can do in your cotton field is to enslave an entire

45
00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:40.250
school. And I was seeing that as a joke,

46
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.700
but there are countries that do exactly that when the fall comes,

47
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.600
they take students out of the classroom to go and pick cotton.

48
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.170
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

49
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.970
<v 1>And you're probably thinking, so in this video,</v>

50
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.890
we're going to talk about terrible things, right?

51
00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:57.380
Like modern slavery and child labor. Because if we are grunt,

52
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.880
I need to go make myself a cup of tea.

53
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.370
And this is going to be one of those ones.

54
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.550
But the truth is that we are not because in the midst of this very bleak

55
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:05.860
situation, we actually have some good news,

56
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.820
forced and child labor in Uzbek, cotton fields continues to fall ill. So names.

57
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.670
So what's the point. If you remember, and a visual politics,

58
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.500
which we talked about as Becca, Stan,

59
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.620
we said the country was won by a wild object dictatorship,

60
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.160
and that it had no scruples about enslaving its population to pick cotton.

61
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.880
And in case anyone was wondering the same dictator who ruled Ben is ruling.

62
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.940
We are talking about Mr. Chef Kat mere soil yet,

63
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.360
and I may have gotten that name wrong, but he's a dictator. So who cares?

64
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.670
No expect nothing has changed.

65
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.120
The Uzbeks continued to suffer under a regime that considers human rights to be

66
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.910
at best optional. And you may ask then,

67
00:03:47.911 --> 00:03:51.390
how is it possible that all of a sudden this dictates or has had an attack of

68
00:03:51.391 --> 00:03:54.300
conscience and he's going to end both forced and child labor.

69
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.320
Has he been visited like Scrooge by three Dickensian ghosts and realized that he

70
00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:01.650
has to change his ways? Well, not exactly.

71
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.040
So why has this Pakistan decided to eliminate forced and child labor?

72
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.940
How is it doing it?

73
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.060
And to what extent can it serve as a model for other cotton producing countries

74
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.280
today, we are going to answer all these questions.

75
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.780
And before we take a look at some history,

76
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.530
I just want to tell you about our new channel visual Academy from the coast,

77
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.940
the Spanish penetrated,

78
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.370
and began to it's covering all the most interesting people,

79
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.160
places and periods in history with some great animation.

80
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.280
And I can only assume a very handsome sighting voiceover. Yeah, yeah.

81
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.050
That man's name was Gingiss. Can you check out? No,

82
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.543
let's get cracking

83
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.560
it's everywhere. It may surprise you. But cotton is one of the 10,

84
00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:45.060
most widely planted crops in the world behind wheat, corn, race soybeans,

85
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.410
and some serious arrives.

86
00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:50.610
2.6% of all cultivated land on the planet is planted in cotton.

87
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.640
That's about the same surface area as Germany pull it.

88
00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.600
Furthermore, as you know, unlike wheat or corn, cotton is not eaten,

89
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.950
but even so occupies twice as much land. As for example, potato fields,

90
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.840
what's more up to 300 million.

91
00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:10.980
People are almost 3% of the world's population worked at some stage of the

92
00:05:10.981 --> 00:05:12.960
cotton production chain. And you're probably thinking,

93
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.420
why do we need to plant so much cotton?

94
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.630
If in principle it's only used for clothing and not all blues,

95
00:05:18.631 --> 00:05:21.840
because there are also clothes that are made of linen or hemp or a myriad of

96
00:05:21.841 --> 00:05:23.580
other fabrics, then that might be true,

97
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.540
but it turns out the cotton is used for pretty much everything. Enlightened.

98
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.580
Look, this five-year old bill is actually pure cotton. Think about it.

99
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.900
If the bills were made of paper,

100
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.960
it would be impossible for them to last very long to withstand getting dumped,

101
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.470
not to mention the occasional spin in the washing machine. On the other hand,

102
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.920
if they are made with cotton fiber, they are more robust, flexible,

103
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.993
and resistant,

104
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.040
but that's not all cotton is also used in a multitude of objects that we use in

105
00:05:53.041 --> 00:05:56.160
our daily lives, home textiles, coffee filters, shoelaces,

106
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:59.300
and it's even component of some flat screen TVs.

107
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.300
The seeds and oil is extracted as used in the production of soaps Margery,

108
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.780
and some plastics, cotton is even used in spacesuits.

109
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.370
And here's a fun fact.

110
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.600
In 2019 trainer tried to plant cotton on the far side of the moon.

111
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.910
The importance of cotton in our lives is easier to understand why there are so

112
00:06:24.911 --> 00:06:27.850
many countries that grew cotton. There are at least 90 of them,

113
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.180
practically half of the world, the main producers are India, China,

114
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.790
and the United States and uncle Sam exports.

115
00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:36.880
The most cotton to the rest of the world for its part.

116
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.580
The European union is pretty far behind.

117
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.510
The only cotton grown here is in Spain and Greece and production does not come

118
00:06:43.511 --> 00:06:45.250
close to that of other continents.

119
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.800
But today we are going to focus on a different region.

120
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.070
One where cotton is so important and relative terrors,

121
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.120
they are one of the largest producers of this white gold per square kilometer

122
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.410
and pear inhabitants.

123
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.590
We are talking about countries that are so dependent on cotton cultivation.

124
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.620
They've even drawn the plant on their national coat of arms.

125
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.100
And they also have quite favorable climatic conditions for producing wine.

126
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.233
<v 0>Cool.</v>

127
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:15.820
<v 1>We're talking about central Asia or as we know it is Pakistan Turkmenistan,</v>

128
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:20.800
Tajikistan Kurt's extend Kazakhstan, Pakistan and Afghanistan. You know,

129
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.933
the stems

130
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.890
Bottom has a very curious property because it is a plant that does not tolerate

131
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.510
frost and needs a warm climate,

132
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.690
but without exceeding 35 degrees Celsius and addition,

133
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.630
the ideal environment is one where there is little moisture because during the

134
00:07:37.631 --> 00:07:41.950
process of harvesting the cotton, it has to be drained. But at the same time,

135
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.610
the plant itself needs a lot of water. For example,

136
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.640
to plant 200 grams of cotton, which is what is used to make,

137
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:53.830
let's say this t-shirt 2000 liters of water are needed of all the water used

138
00:07:53.831 --> 00:07:58.540
in agricultural work. 3.5% goes exclusively to the production of cotton.

139
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.050
So tonight, if you look on a map for a place that is warm,

140
00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:08.050
but not too hot without frost with a moderately dry climate,

141
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.400
but it still has a lot of water.

142
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.910
The truth is that you will find that there are quite a few areas with optimal

143
00:08:12.911 --> 00:08:15.310
conditions for growing cotton. These days,

144
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:19.210
73% of the world's cotton is produced thanks to irrigation systems.

145
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.750
And that means if you grew a lot of cotton, you use up a lot.

146
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:26.740
And I mean a lot of water so much that there are regions that are losing their

147
00:08:26.741 --> 00:08:29.890
rivers and lakes because of the massive production of white gold.

148
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.660
Remember this because in a few minutes,

149
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:35.350
I'm going to tell you about the biggest water tragedy ever caused by color.

150
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:40.170
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

151
00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:43.000
<v 1>Set up. We are not only talking about ecological disasters,</v>

152
00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:46.630
but also humanitarian wounds because there are countries where cotton is

153
00:08:46.631 --> 00:08:49.540
harvested by slave labor or even children.

154
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:53.500
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

155
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.000
<v 1>What's worse. It is very difficult.</v>

156
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.320
Know if the t-shirt you are wearing right now is one of the garments made by

157
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:01.800
forced labor because the cotton supply chain is one of the most complex and the

158
00:09:01.801 --> 00:09:05.310
world. I mean, this one could be made by slave labor.

159
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.710
No, I'm going to tell you the story of a dirty slave labor made cotton.

160
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.430
T-shirt like, I've never worn first. A seed is planted. And one of those fields,

161
00:09:16.431 --> 00:09:19.880
we talked about warm, dry, and with a lot of water, a few months later,

162
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.060
someone has to pick off the typical cotton balls and take them to a ginning

163
00:09:23.061 --> 00:09:26.510
factory where the Lindt is separated from the seat and any kind of impurities,

164
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.850
the cotton lint, which is used in the textile industry,

165
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.020
travels to another place,

166
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.470
whereas washed and pass through a press to become a block of cotton,

167
00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.400
which is also called.

168
00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.590
<v 0>Weirdly a cake. This.</v>

169
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:37.940
<v 1>Goes to the next stage of production,</v>

170
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.230
where transformed into a yarn then comes the weaving or knit process in which

171
00:09:42.231 --> 00:09:45.800
this yarn becomes a fabric. And finally someone will make our t-shirts,

172
00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:46.820
which can then go on display.

173
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.860
And one of the windows of the major fashion brands,

174
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:56.120
Everything I have told you could happen in one country,

175
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.310
but the truth is that this is not often the case.

176
00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.740
The most common story is that the cotton is picked in country,

177
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:05.480
a transformed into a fabric and country B made up in country C and finally

178
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:06.830
sold in country.

179
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.550
D we are talking about a super traditional sector with a very long production

180
00:10:10.551 --> 00:10:14.240
chain and a lot of hands through which the cotton weaves its way before becoming

181
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:18.890
a team. Therefore, at the end of the day,

182
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.220
it was very difficult to know who produces the raw cotton used to make,

183
00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.180
for example, Zara's t-shirts and I know what you're wondering right now,

184
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:30.020
if cotton is in such high demand, why isn't it pecked by machines?

185
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:30.980
It may surprise you,

186
00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.980
but agriculture is one of the sectors that has changed the most in the last

187
00:10:33.981 --> 00:10:38.420
century. Nowadays, almost nobody harvests wheat by hand harvesting machines.

188
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:43.340
They do it. So why in the case of cotton, are children still being used? Well,

189
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.510
let's take a look at that.

190
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.823
<v 0>Right now,</v>

191
00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:50.533
the Soviet.

192
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.900
<v 1>Crap. Normally, when we talk about the great empires of the world,</v>

193
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.830
we think of the British, the French, the Spanish colonizers,

194
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.800
maybe even the Americans, but not the Russian empire,

195
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:04.460
because most of us take it for granted that the Russian empire is so big because

196
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.340
well, Russia is of it's as simple as that, right?

197
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.250
I think maybe when the countries of the world were dividing up all the lens of

198
00:11:10.251 --> 00:11:14.360
the planet, Russia said, you give me two, but instead through the joker,

199
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.430
but the truth is no. In fact,

200
00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:21.140
the great Russian empire expanded very slowly and only became great as

201
00:11:21.141 --> 00:11:24.260
such in the 18th century. When they took over all of Siberia,

202
00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.350
they continue to expand in the South until they reached central Asia.

203
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.350
And that's where they found the perfect place to plant corn.

204
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:38.630
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

205
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:42.410
<v 1>Warm, dry climate with several rivers to boots. So what's the problem.</v>

206
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:46.490
The problem was that for some reason, they didn't trust the entire population.

207
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:49.100
They had just forcibly annexed, you know,

208
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.950
colonizer stuff besides like all good colonizers.

209
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.120
They thought they were the superior.

210
00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:56.740
And that's why all the production was always in the hands of Russian

211
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.990
businessmen. Now we jump ahead to October, 1917. What happened on this date?

212
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.900
Exactly goodbye, Russian empire, hello,

213
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:09.580
union of Soviet socialist republics. At that point,

214
00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.670
the communist party said, no, we are all a brotherhood.

215
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.850
We are all comrades today for you to borrow for me.

216
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.900
So central Asian republics keep planting cotton as if they will know tomorrow.

217
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.590
And in return, the rest of the USSR will see to it that you will lack nothing.

218
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:28.150
And that helps to explain why it was Pakistan produced two thirds of all the

219
00:12:28.151 --> 00:12:29.530
cotton in the Soviet union.

220
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:34.110
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

221
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.410
<v 1>So you're probably thinking though, well, that's good, right? I mean,</v>

222
00:12:37.411 --> 00:12:40.800
what's wrong with, is Pakistan producing a lot of cotton? Well, believe me,

223
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.100
it is a problem. You remember that growing cotton requires a lot of water,

224
00:12:44.101 --> 00:12:47.940
right? And I mean, a lot of water, well is Pakistan is a desert country.

225
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.480
So where did he get all the water? The answer is in the ROC.

226
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.220
If I asked you to point it out on a map,

227
00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:56.700
you had better be pretty quick because it has practically disappeared.

228
00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.910
That's right. The RLC is one of the largest lakes in the world.

229
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.930
Or rather we should say at once, check this out.

230
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.590
You're talking about one of the largest salt lakes in the world,

231
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:12.810
on the border between Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan,

232
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.750
which in turn was fed by several rivers. Well,

233
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.660
what the communist party did was to say, well, let's see here.

234
00:13:18.661 --> 00:13:21.870
Do we have the fourth largest Lake in the world with a lot of aquatic life and

235
00:13:21.871 --> 00:13:23.580
totally dependent on two rivers,

236
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:27.240
we can divert the water from these rivers to the cotton plantations and see what

237
00:13:27.241 --> 00:13:30.990
happens. As you can imagine. When the two rivers stopped filling the ROC,

238
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:33.930
it began to gradually shrink. And at the same time,

239
00:13:33.931 --> 00:13:37.410
keep in mind that as the Soviet union was the communist country, par excellence,

240
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.270
all production, including cotton plantations was in the hands of.

241
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.213
<v 0>The state.</v>

242
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:45.990
<v 1>What does this mean? Well,</v>

243
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:48.270
those who worked in these fields did not own the land.

244
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.830
They did not keep the cotton, the pecs,

245
00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.920
and they had to meet very high delivery quarters for cotton.

246
00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.030
But on the other hand,

247
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.210
the field was not their property and they could stop managing it at any point

248
00:13:57.211 --> 00:13:59.580
that the committee on duty told them to in conclusion,

249
00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.550
they had no incentive to invest in machinery.

250
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.540
And I know what you're going to tell me.

251
00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:07.170
Now it's been almost 30 years since the fall of the Soviet union. In fact,

252
00:14:07.171 --> 00:14:09.360
it was, Pakistan is no longer a Soviet Republic,

253
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:12.360
but it's own independent country. And yes you are. Right.

254
00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:14.730
But as far as ownership of the countryside is concerned,

255
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.160
the system remains virtually and tucked.

256
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:20.100
And now I know what you thinking in the 1990s,

257
00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.210
both is Pakistan and to GICA Stan became independent and yes, you're right,

258
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.850
but their economies were designed to export a single product.

259
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.673
<v 0>Cotton.</v>

260
00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.870
<v 1>Think about it. If depending on oil is problematic,</v>

261
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.480
a commodity in which has much more demand. And for your producers,

262
00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:41.010
imagine what happens if your nation is dependent on cotton from one day to the

263
00:14:41.011 --> 00:14:41.430
next,

264
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:45.450
it was Pakistan was competing face-to-face with the United States and China.

265
00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:49.590
They had no technology and no industry, the produced. Anything else,

266
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.240
no matter that the countries of central became independent from the Soviet union

267
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.120
land ownership remained in the hands of the state.

268
00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:57.453
<v 0>Listen up.</v>

269
00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:06.070
<v 2>The land it's minerals, waters, flora, and fauna.</v>

270
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:10.090
Other natural resources shall constitute the national wealth and shall be

271
00:15:10.091 --> 00:15:14.890
rationally used and protected by the state article 55 constitution of

272
00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:19.330
Uzbekistan land it's end trails,

273
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.460
water airspace, flora, and fauna,

274
00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:25.640
and other natural resources shall be owned by the state and the state guaranteed

275
00:15:25.641 --> 00:15:28.240
their effective use in the interest of the people.

276
00:15:28.241 --> 00:15:30.790
Article 13 constitution of Tajikistan.

277
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.450
<v 1>That's right. And these countries, the very earth itself belongs to the state.</v>

278
00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.940
That means that you may be lucky enough to be given a farm,

279
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:41.530
but in return you will have to plant what the state tells you. So once again,

280
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.560
it doesn't pay for farmers to make large investments in machinery,

281
00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.500
but that's not the only reason that harvesting is mechanized.

282
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.180
Even if it's less efficient, handpick,

283
00:15:49.181 --> 00:15:52.690
cotton pays much better because it's better quality. Just to give you an idea.

284
00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:56.980
A kilo of picked cotton pays 16 cents more than machine picked cotton.

285
00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:00.730
In other words, both of the United States and Europe machine harvest cotton,

286
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:04.270
and can therefore offer more competitive prices than is Pakistan and the other

287
00:16:04.271 --> 00:16:05.590
central Asian countries.

288
00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.430
The only way these countries can compete is in the niche market of handpicked

289
00:16:09.431 --> 00:16:12.280
cotton. Mostly because there are very few producers of this type.

290
00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.640
If we also keep in mind that these producers tend to be wilds dictatorships,

291
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.470
we find ourselves with barbarities.

292
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:18.963
<v 0>Yes.</v>

293
00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:25.390
<v 2>Because Pakistan has second highest prevalence of modern slavery in the world,</v>

294
00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:26.290
Euro Asia net.

295
00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.710
<v 1>Every year up to 2 million people worked on Uzbek,</v>

296
00:16:29.711 --> 00:16:33.160
cotton plantations against their wealth. And that included children,

297
00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.370
basically September came and instead of getting out of their new textbooks,

298
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.150
students and their teachers would take a bus, go to a cotton plantation.

299
00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:45.140
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

300
00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.450
<v 1>May seem incredible to you,</v>

301
00:16:46.451 --> 00:16:50.020
but this has been the reality and is Pakistan until just a couple of years ago,

302
00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.940
when this came out in the international media,

303
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.780
you do spec government tried to backpedal a little bit and banned child labors

304
00:16:55.781 --> 00:16:58.450
in the cotton fields, but they didn't do it quite right.

305
00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.730
Although the children's stopped working on the plantations,

306
00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:05.920
their teachers still spent September, October, and November picking cotton.

307
00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:09.400
So what the outcome is Beck children couldn't go to school.

308
00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:11.320
So now the burning question is,

309
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.320
so what has happened more recently to change this situation?

310
00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:17.560
Why has this Pakistan banned slavery almost overnight? Well,

311
00:17:17.561 --> 00:17:19.600
that is what we're going to look at right now.

312
00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.170
<v 2>The market decides mate, look.</v>

313
00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.770
<v 1>The label on your possibly dirty slave made t-shirt you degenerate.</v>

314
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.800
I would never wear such a thing. I'm sure it doesn't say maiden is Pakistan.

315
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:36.070
It probably says something like made in Turkey or made in Bangladesh.

316
00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.400
And you'll say, what, why are they lying to us as is always the case?

317
00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.293
The answer is

318
00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:47.020
For the cotton production gene. We talked about before,

319
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:50.370
which is one of the longest and most complex in the, and what have I told you?

320
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.550
But the country that imports the most cotton from countries like Afghanistan to

321
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:54.990
Pakistan and his Pakistan.

322
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:56.263
<v 0>Is Turkey.</v>

323
00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:00.830
<v 1>Turkey.</v>

324
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:04.370
Turkey is one of those countries where companies like Nike or H and M have their

325
00:18:04.371 --> 00:18:08.000
textile factories. Now it should begin to make sense. Indeed.

326
00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.840
Turkey is one of the largest cotton hubs in Europe ever seen as a raw material

327
00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:15.590
from central Asia and converts it into clothing or sends fabric to large textile

328
00:18:15.591 --> 00:18:16.190
factories.

329
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:17.023
<v 0>Other countries.</v>

330
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.290
<v 1>It's impossible to trace where the cotton and your t-shirt comes from. However,</v>

331
00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:28.130
I'm sure none of you would buy a t-shirt knowing that slave labor has been

332
00:18:28.131 --> 00:18:30.170
involved. I certainly would. Of course,

333
00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.620
there's already a huge debate around companies outsourcing to countries with

334
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:38.300
cheap labor, but no one absolutely movement defends the use of slavery.

335
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:41.180
And some will think the multinationals don't care about it and slipping anyone

336
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.270
if it means making money. And though sometimes that's true.

337
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.910
Consumers don't think the same way.

338
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:51.740
And neither does NGOs nor most importantly the courts.

339
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:56.660
So what is the solution? Well, on the one hand quality signals right now,

340
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.570
there are a lot of agencies that oversee cotton production and only quit.

341
00:18:59.571 --> 00:19:00.860
The seal on finished items,

342
00:19:00.861 --> 00:19:03.860
have no children or slaves have been involved in production.

343
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.450
And that explains news.

344
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:06.523
<v 0>Like this.</v>

345
00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:13.610
<v 2>Pakistan over 100 companies as shoe who's, Beck, cotton, Euro Asia net.</v>

346
00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.460
<v 1>Wait, this is what happened in 2012,</v>

347
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:19.400
suddenly it was Pakistan lost almost all of its buyers.

348
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:22.850
We're not just talking about companies here. We're talking about governments.

349
00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.140
<v 2>You lawmakers block textile deal with who's Becca Stan,</v>

350
00:19:30.141 --> 00:19:33.140
over child labor concerns, R F E R L.

351
00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.530
<v 1>Certainly it was Pakistan became the Golem of countries,</v>

352
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:41.390
small despised and obsessed with its precious cotton. But not only that,

353
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:45.080
it was done needed to reduce its dependence on cotton. For example,

354
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:47.900
they needed to start growing wheat. So they wouldn't have to import it.

355
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.270
On the other hand, if they wanted to continue selling cotton,

356
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.210
they had no choice, but to leave slavery behind.

357
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:58.250
And that explains why since 2012, the country has been reforming its policies.

358
00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:01.430
First, they stopped forcing children to grow and pick cotton.

359
00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:03.800
Then they stopped and sleeping officials.

360
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:06.560
And we're not just talking about a superficial change here,

361
00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:09.080
according to the international labor organization,

362
00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.720
which is not exactly friendly to the Islamic government,

363
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:16.070
94% of the people who were picking cotton in 2019 did so

364
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:20.090
voluntarily. Of course, that still means there is 6% of slave labor.

365
00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.940
But remember that we're talking about changing a system that has sustained the

366
00:20:22.941 --> 00:20:26.510
entire national economy for decades. And now, uh,

367
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:28.340
nor you're thinking about what we were thinking about,

368
00:20:28.341 --> 00:20:31.220
what you thought before is Pakistan has no technology and no,

369
00:20:31.221 --> 00:20:34.040
they have no sleeves. How can they be competitive in the marketplace?

370
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.020
The answer lies in the roots of the problem.

371
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:40.310
Why are there no tractors and is Pakistan exactly because there is no private

372
00:20:40.311 --> 00:20:43.100
initiative. So it's time to change the rules.

373
00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:48.160
<v 0>Of the gate. These buckets Buckystown to start.</v>

374
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.870
<v 2>Land privatization next year</v>

375
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:57.130
Is trying to face this us forced labor sanctions whose Pakistan becomes a model

376
00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:57.993
Forbes.

377
00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:01.590
<v 1>And now I know what you're thinking about, what you were thinking about,</v>

378
00:21:01.591 --> 00:21:03.090
what you thought before, what you thought before,

379
00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.910
come on grind is a dictatorship as corrupt as the Uzbek one,

380
00:21:05.911 --> 00:21:09.300
really going to sell off their fields transparently. And on that one,

381
00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:10.410
you are absolutely right.

382
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.280
The privatization of Uzbek cotton is anything but squeaky clean.

383
00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.650
And also the laws are pretty confusing.

384
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:20.040
So what they've actually done has been to seed the cultivation of the cotton

385
00:21:20.041 --> 00:21:22.830
fields and then the processing of it to private entrepreneurs,

386
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:25.410
one per each region. In other words,

387
00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.610
each of these entrepreneurs has a monopoly on cotton in their region.

388
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:31.020
And without a doubt,

389
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:35.100
the greatest beneficiary of all this privatization is a local company called

390
00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.490
whose tanks. We are talking about the largest conglomerate and is Bekenstein.

391
00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.490
And one that has very clear connections with the government.

392
00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:46.200
This company has taken over crops from most of the regions, but to be honest,

393
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:49.290
corruption is nothing. The per is backs don't already know about. No,

394
00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.740
at least they're starting to see farm machinery in their fields.

395
00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:54.203
<v 0>Listen to, it.</v>

396
00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:01.710
<v 2>Was Buckystown to speed up mechanization of cotton picking.</v>

397
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.110
<v 1>But wait, just one woman,</v>

398
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.290
if you thought that privatizing the countryside was enough to and slavery once,

399
00:22:07.291 --> 00:22:09.210
and for all, you are very much mistaken.

400
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.690
Many of these factories are having trouble finding labor.

401
00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:16.800
So think about this before. It was as simple as forcing everyone to pick cotton.

402
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:21.000
Now they have to get used to making work contracts. And in many cases,

403
00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:24.990
some of these private farms are turning to local authorities to get people back

404
00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:25.590
to work.

405
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:29.580
Remember that we are still talking about a dictatorship where there is no rule

406
00:22:29.581 --> 00:22:30.750
of law. Even today,

407
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:34.350
many local politicians can use the police to enslave the population.

408
00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:39.030
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

409
00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:39.510
<v 1>Other hunt,</v>

410
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:43.440
independent contracted workers do not have enviable conditions either.

411
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:44.100
At the moment,

412
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:48.390
the going rate for a cotton picker is about two and a half years ID.

413
00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:51.870
This is a low wage even by Uzbek standards. However,

414
00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:56.790
these Pakistan of 2020 is much fairer than that of 2012. More importantly,

415
00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:00.630
all of these new landowners are starting to invest in cotton pressing technology

416
00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:05.160
today. 70% of the countryside of is Pakistan is already in private hands and is

417
00:23:05.161 --> 00:23:08.910
starting to use agricultural machinery. But not only that,

418
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:10.200
all these new landowners,

419
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:13.710
especially those belonging to the ooze tax group are starting to invest in

420
00:23:13.711 --> 00:23:17.130
cotton processing factors. In other words, in a few years,

421
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:20.940
it was Pakistan could stop exporting rock often and start selling higher value

422
00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:23.970
added products, such as cotton yarn, or even a little bit.

423
00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.120
Do you think that the Uzbek reforms are a good example for other cotton

424
00:23:27.121 --> 00:23:28.020
producing countries?

425
00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:31.080
Do you think the international sanctions could be more effective now again,

426
00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:32.460
slave labor and gene Jang.

427
00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:36.330
And do you think that I was ever wearing a t-shirt because you are mistaken,

428
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:39.870
it was always just this silk shirt, have your answer in the comments as always.
