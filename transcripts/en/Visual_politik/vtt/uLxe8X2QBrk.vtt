00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.760
<v 0>Just before we get into today's video. Let me thank today's sponsors.</v>

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.593

with thousands of classes in design business, and more.

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.070
We've talked about skill Gere a few times on this channel and mentioned various

6
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:16.170
courses and things you can learn on that platform,

7
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.530
but maybe you haven't gone Skillshare yet, and you were totally skinless.

8
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.950
That's a great shame because there are thousands of classes on Skillshare for

9
00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:26.250
you to level up your design, your business, your video, your social media,

10
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.840
whatever skills as you want to improve,

11
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.420
or just take them from nothing to something. You can.

12
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.760
<v 1>Do that too. At.</v>

13
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.790
<v 0>The time, when so many important conversations are happening in our world,</v>

camera courses, loads of YouTube stuff.

17
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.760
And we also want to squeeze as much out of our day as possible.

18
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.040
So we watched this course by a guy called Thomas Frank,

19
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.650
who is also a YouTuber on getting more stuff done in a day.

20
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.530
It's great stuff and worth checking out if you want to be more productive.

21
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.800
So yes, Skillshare just go do it. You'll like it.

28
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.420
We warn you that this video may hurt your sensibilities and cause you a strong

29
00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:20.400
sense of indignation. And it's.

30
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:23.220
We are going to talk about the Royal house with possibly the most reprehensible

31
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:25.590
and despotic behavior in the entire world.

32
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.250
Saturn Royals from my country's own reprehensible behavior, not withstanding.

33
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.001
We are going to tell you,

34
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:33.780
I have a Salton has turned these people into a kind of cash cow that he milks

35
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.050
relentlessly. Are you ready? So let's get started.

36
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.850
Can you to think of a country in Southeast Asia, other than Singapore,

37
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.330
and that has a GDP per capita, similar to that to Spain or South Korea?

38
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.350
What country would you think of? I'll give you a few seconds. Three, two, one,

39
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.160
any ideas I'm sure. Very few of you would have thought of Brunei that says,

40
00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:02.930
if you haven't already read the title of this video,

41
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.790
which admittedly is a little bit of a giveaway,

42
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.180
and it's very unlikely that the vast majority of you have heard of the small

43
00:02:08.181 --> 00:02:11.960
country nestled on the Island of Borneo and surrounded by territories belonging

44
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:13.850
to the Malaysian Federation after all.

45
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.060
It's not only small in terms of territory, but also in population.

46
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.550
The country officially known as the state of Brunei.

47
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.100
Doris alum has barely half a million and a half,

48
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.910
Despite not being well known.

49
00:02:28.911 --> 00:02:31.970
We are talking about one of the countries with the highest wealth per capita

50
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.350
ratios in the world. It's oil and gas reserves are relatively huge.

51
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.310
And Salton has an Al bulkier has been able to take advantage of oil and

52
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.391
liquified natural gas,

53
00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:44.870
which they also process generate more than half of the nation's GDP.

54
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:45.590
What's more,

55
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.430
most of these resources are extracted from its exclusive economic zone at sea

56
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.091
giving Brunei.

57
00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:52.870
One of the best preserved natural environments on the face of the.

58
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.130
<v 1>Wow, so far.</v>

59
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.130
Thanks. So pretty good. Right? But hold.

60
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.150
<v 0>On just one moment,</v>

61
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.630
because you already know that all that glitters is not gold and this couldn't be

62
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:06.580
more true than in the case of Bruno.

63
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.643
<v 1>Right?</v>

64
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.850
<v 0>Swiping such a wealthy country.</v>

65
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.710
The reality is that Bruneians millions for new Orleans Bruneians they enjoy a

66
00:03:16.711 --> 00:03:18.390
fairly average standard of living.

67
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.640
The thing is though national bank balance is a site.

68
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.470
If we're talking about freedoms or human rights,

69
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.440
it's not just that this Asian countries track record is poor,

70
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.620
is that it keeps getting worse. But having said that,

71
00:03:28.621 --> 00:03:30.570
I'm sure you already have a few questions.

72
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.450
Questions like F this alternate is apparently so rich.

73
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.630
What happens to all the money that Brunei citizens just don't see what's

74
00:03:36.631 --> 00:03:38.130
happening politically in the country.

75
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.350
So that's unlike most of the rest of the world.

76
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.170
Civil rights and freedoms are actually in decline. Well,

77
00:03:43.171 --> 00:03:44.850
my visual quality goes and there's a video.

78
00:03:44.851 --> 00:03:46.470
We are going to answer those two questions.

79
00:03:46.471 --> 00:03:49.830
And we are going to tell you some things about the most extreme eccentricities

80
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.310
and the most totalitarian leanings of the current Sultan. Are you ready?

81
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.600
So let's go to Brunei, but not really because their human rights are appalling.

82
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.100
<v 1>The wasteful sultanates.</v>

83
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.790
<v 0>And to see next as a story that seems to be taken entirely from a Hollywood</v>

84
00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:14.880
movie, you know, it's one of those stories of mega wealthy sell tons.

85
00:04:14.881 --> 00:04:18.090
There's a random sales with the most extravagant luxuries you can possibly

86
00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:21.540
imagine and who even have a harem of women all to themselves, you know,

87
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.780
like Hollywood movies or that dream I had last night. Well,

88
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.170
that's not too far off of what the current Royal house of Brunei has become a

89
00:04:28.171 --> 00:04:32.250
Royal house that not only likes to own things, but also likes to flaunt them.

90
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.480
Take, for example,

91
00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:37.620
the 14 million gold rolls Royce limousine owned by CELTA and has Hassanah.

92
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.010
I know don't think that's the only expensive car he keeps in his garage,

93
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.530
not by a long shot. In fact,

94
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.850
it is estimated that the Royal house has more than 7,000 vehicles at his

95
00:04:47.851 --> 00:04:48.480
disposal.

96
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.140
We are talking about a fleet with an estimated value of around wait for it's

97
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.530
$5 billion in cars alone. That's right.

98
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.420
$5 billion.

99
00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.673
<v 1>A beat.</v>

100
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.950
<v 0>Of course we are talking about assault on whose wealth is estimated to be more</v>

101
00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:08.760
than a $20 billion to give you an idea that figure is much,

102
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.630
much higher than the entire gross domestic product of the entire country.

103
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.260
In fact,

104
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.520
if we take into account that the country's GDP is around about 13.5 billion,

105
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.780
this means that the assault on fortune is almost 50% greater to give you an

106
00:05:21.781 --> 00:05:24.450
example of what that's like. That would be equivalent to, I don't know,

107
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.310
the British Royal family managing a wealth of almost $4 trillion with a

108
00:05:29.311 --> 00:05:34.110
T that's more than the entire GDP of Germany. And that is nuts.

109
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.540
The fact is that among the immense in Venturi,

110
00:05:39.541 --> 00:05:42.630
that makes up the cell towns assets, we can find a 10 luxury yachts,

111
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.610
at least 17 airplanes have more than 150 mansions and 12 different countries.

112
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.600
And that is not all as if these assets were not enough of a display of

113
00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:52.950
ostentatious and luxury.

114
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.100
This self-tan lives in the largest private palace in the world,

115
00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.650
a policy that has no than 1,788 rooms, 257 bathrooms,

116
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.513
five swimming pools,

117
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.690
it's own private mosque and a garage for 110 of its thousands of cars along with

118
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.550
many other features. For example,

119
00:06:07.551 --> 00:06:11.210
the entire pilot is lined with 38 types of Italian, marble Shanghai,

120
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.570
granted English, crystals, and Indian silk decorations. In other words,

121
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.380
we are talking about a guy who does not skimp when it comes to luxury to

122
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:21.590
illustrate this during his wildest days, when he was just a little younger,

123
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.320
it's estimated that the Salton spent almost $750,000 a day for 10.

124
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.940
<v 1>Of course.</v>

125
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.010
<v 0>It's not all about flashing the luxury goods.</v>

126
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.830
The Sultan also has his business side. For example,

127
00:06:35.831 --> 00:06:39.640
he even has his own hotel chain. Well, technically the chain,

128
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.640
the Dorchester collection is owned by the country's sovereign fund.

129
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.370
A fund that in turn depends on the ministry of finance,

130
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.240
which surprise surprise is run by self-tan has an ally himself.

131
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.680
Let's just say the end night,

132
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.070
there is basically no difference between the public patrimony and the patrimony

133
00:06:54.071 --> 00:06:56.980
of the Royal house, or rather the, in this alternate,

134
00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.010
the public patrimony belongs to the Royal house.

135
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:03.280
<v 1>Of course.</v>

136
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.830
<v 0>All this immense fortune is not only enjoyed by the Sultan,</v>

137
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.650
but also by his entire family who, by the way,

138
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.640
don't hold back and exhibiting that wealth on social media networks. In fact,

139
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.110
his 10th child is quite the Instagram star with more than 2 million followers on

140
00:07:17.111 --> 00:07:19.870
Instagram, young team at just 29 years old.

141
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.120
It doesn't hold back and showing his helicopter flights,

142
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.730
his parachute drops his yachting, his love of polo,

143
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.220
or his travels around the world by private jet.

144
00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:30.670
And if I sound a little better that's because I am I'd hardly have any Instagram

145
00:07:30.671 --> 00:07:33.190
followers. If you want to follow me at the grantee graced,

146
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.540
please do I create validation? How does that,

147
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.290
that you've got to hand this to them because these are clearly productive

148
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.020
people. They're more than productive. They're super productive. I mean,

149
00:07:41.021 --> 00:07:43.600
think of all the things they managed to pack into their days. Well,

150
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.550
I'm here just recording.

151
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.130
<v 1>How to use, but as you.</v>

152
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.620
<v 0>Know, visual politics is not a celebrity gossip shoe.</v>

153
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.850
If we tell you all these things,

154
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.720
it's simply to get ourselves a little better situated because keep one thing in

155
00:07:55.721 --> 00:07:59.500
mind, Brunei is not just any country and neither is the Sultan.

156
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:00.730
Just any Sultan

157
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:09.340
Personnel is considered one of the last absolute monarchs of the 21st century.

158
00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:13.030
And it's the second longest ruling Monarch a past only by the queen of England

159
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.380
who we all know, we'll never know

160
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.400
The more precise he has been on the throne since 1967.

161
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.740
And take note because he is not only the Sultan.

162
00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.540
He also holds the possessions of prime minister,

163
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.920
minister of defense minister of finance and minister of foreign affairs.

164
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.900
And who knows maybe during the making of this video,

165
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:35.230
he's put himself in charge of yet another ministry like the ministry of polo or

166
00:08:35.231 --> 00:08:37.420
yachting or having too many cards. So yeah,

167
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:39.250
the government is basically just heavy.

168
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.050
Can you imagine a meeting of the executive?

169
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.600
It's basically one of those houses of mirrors that you get in the circus,

170
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.580
unless you see between the ministry of defense,

171
00:08:45.581 --> 00:08:48.010
the ministry of finance and the ministry of foreign affairs.

172
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.450
There will always be a consensus because it is pretty difficult not to agree

173
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:56.670
with yourself. The minister's council sessions must be pretty boring and short.

174
00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.960
This is an example of what absolute power looks like. Now at this point,

175
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:02.580
I'm sure many of you were thinking, okay,

176
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:05.760
this man must be the typical desk bot who rules in dollar bills at night while

177
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:09.660
there's people starved. Right? Well, the truth has no, not really.

178
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:10.860
At least not completely.

179
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.103
<v 1>Wheatley.</v>

180
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.870
<v 0>Not make system developed in Brunei is anything but typical Brunei is the</v>

181
00:09:17.871 --> 00:09:20.450
textbook definition of a rentier welfare state.

182
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.290
But let me explain the Royal house of Brunei buys the loyalty and silence of the

183
00:09:24.291 --> 00:09:27.020
people and exchange for certain services, which are of course,

184
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.850
trifles compared to the potential wealth,

185
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.420
but it citizens should enjoy considering the immense riches of the country.

186
00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.630
So how do they get away with it? Well, let's take a look

187
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:42.740
Because basically the Brunei government uses a small parts of its oil and gas

188
00:09:42.741 --> 00:09:47.390
revenues to ensure that it's 460,000 inhabitants do not lack the basics and the

189
00:09:47.391 --> 00:09:49.430
rest they keep for themselves.

190
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.570
And this way they can continue to live like gods without risking that the people

191
00:09:53.571 --> 00:09:55.700
will rebel against them due to hunger or poverty,

192
00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.000
or even questioned the unethical behaviors of their leaders.

193
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.880
So basically what they do is they throw the citizens, a few parents,

194
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.840
some crumbs from the table, if you will. And they also rule with an iron fist,

195
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:09.440
because if there is one thing that is expressly for bed and above all others and

196
00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:11.600
Brunei does speaking ill of the royalty.

197
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.793
<v 1>Emily.</v>

198
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.020
<v 0>Careful though, because when we say that Brunei citizens receive the basics,</v>

199
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.640
we mean a house and a car,

200
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.610
both of which are subsidized with Lewins at very low rates,

201
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.830
but also receive free health care and dental care,

202
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.110
free education and old age pensions,

203
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.560
even funerals are subsidized by the government. Of course,

204
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.800
don't be fooled by thinking that the health and education are high quality.

205
00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:37.160
The government keeps a tight purse. It's a question of incentives.

206
00:10:37.161 --> 00:10:40.520
The more money you have left over, the more money goes into your pocket.

207
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:44.630
<v 1>I mean.</v>

208
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:48.050
<v 0>To be fair, this description may not be technically accurate, but in practice,</v>

209
00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.570
this is pretty much how things work in Brunei.

210
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.990
We are talking about a country and what citizens have become highly dependent on

211
00:10:53.991 --> 00:10:57.590
state revenues and therefore on whatever the cell tan wants to give them.

212
00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.400
But standard of living is nowhere near that of developed countries.

213
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:05.240
And as the saying goes, there is no such thing as a free lunch.

214
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.880
And in Berneice case, the trade-off is freedom,

215
00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.800
human rights and social mobility.

216
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.920
Unless of course you happen to have the good fortune to be born into the

217
00:11:12.921 --> 00:11:15.350
wealthier upper classes that maintain close ties,

218
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.570
very close ties with the Royal house.

219
00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.650
And that is what explains headlines like this found in 2019.

220
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:27.680
<v 2>This new penal code would enshrine quote, cruel and inhumane punishments,</v>

221
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:31.700
UN rights, chief warns, United nations news. So.

222
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.580
<v 0>What on earth is happening now with politics and Brunei? So the,</v>

223
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.140
even the UN itself,

224
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:39.470
which typically looks the other way in political issues is jumping up and down

225
00:11:39.471 --> 00:11:42.620
and sending all the alarms. What are the evils that are so serious?

226
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:47.060
The Sultan eight has decided to punish them and accrue an inhumane way. Well,

227
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.313
let's see.

228
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.900
<v 1>Islamism, vice and hypocrisy Brunei.</v>

229
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.300
<v 0>The Muslim majority country,</v>

230
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.060
approximately three out of every four and hot buttons are Muslim.

231
00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:06.450
The rest are a mixture of Christian, Buddhist and indigenous beliefs.

232
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.040
But despite the fact that one in four people is not Muslim since 2014,

233
00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:14.400
the country has introduced reforms and punishments from Islamic law,

234
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:15.960
the Sharia to his penal code.

235
00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:19.110
It was an idea that came to Sultan Hassanah at the end of the nineties.

236
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:21.750
And that most of us citizens kind of didn't think it was all that bad.

237
00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.670
Although seeing how things work here,

238
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.640
it looks like their opinion wouldn't have mattered, basically a tall.

239
00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.420
So my friends, do you want to know more about evil ideas? Well, if so,

240
00:12:30.421 --> 00:12:32.190
then hold on to your seat

241
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.300
Because the reforms that began to be implemented in 2014 were completed in

242
00:12:39.301 --> 00:12:42.450
April, 2019. They stipulate for example,

243
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.190
the consensual sexual relations between men carry the death penalty by stoning.

244
00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:51.600
Those between women are punishable by up to 40 lashes with a stick or 10 years

245
00:12:51.601 --> 00:12:52.110
in prison.

246
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:56.190
And amputation of limbs has been imposed for themes starting with the right hand

247
00:12:56.191 --> 00:13:00.300
and continuing with the left foot. If they re-offend. In other words, in 2019,

248
00:13:00.301 --> 00:13:03.810
the Sultan of Brunei completed what most of the stretch establishment of Sharia

249
00:13:03.811 --> 00:13:06.870
law throughout the entire country and an environment in which no neighboring

250
00:13:06.871 --> 00:13:09.560
Muslim country, as established capital penalties for this type of.

251
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:10.463
<v 1>Behavior.</v>

252
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:14.581
<v 0>This way,</v>

253
00:13:14.581 --> 00:13:18.630
Brunei has become the only country in Southeast Asia to impose a strict version

254
00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:21.360
of Islamic law in the style of Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia.

255
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:23.003
<v 1>Right?</v>

256
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:25.921
<v 0>Of course,</v>

257
00:13:25.921 --> 00:13:29.580
to date Brunei has not yet applied the death penalty for any of these cases.

258
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:34.110
And in fact has not executed anyone since 1957 when the country was still a

259
00:13:34.111 --> 00:13:36.840
British protectorate. But the fact that they have added Shari,

260
00:13:36.841 --> 00:13:39.300
a lot of the penal code sends out a dangerous warning.

261
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.640
The power of the Sultan is above all else,

262
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.820
and he will continue to be the guarantor of the purity of Islam and the

263
00:13:44.821 --> 00:13:48.180
application of its law in the most fundamentalist version possible.

264
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.780
But hold on just one moment, because given all of these rules,

265
00:13:51.781 --> 00:13:53.430
I'm sure many of you are thinking, okay,

266
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.620
if the salt mine is so devoted to Islam,

267
00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:59.520
then he should also live as the Islamic tradition and rules dictate, right?

268
00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.340
Well, it will come as a surprise to none of you. That's new,

269
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:05.550
not really in finance. He seems to do quite the opposite,

270
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.400
a religious figure being hyper-critical surely not.

271
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.550
It's not only because there's luxurious way of life and his flaunted wealth run

272
00:14:11.551 --> 00:14:13.650
contrary to the humility that Islam promulgates,

273
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.750
but also because of his personal behavior,

274
00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.560
you see both Al and his brother Jeffrey have a lifestyle. That's a bet.

275
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:24.540
How can we put this controversial as controversial as it has notorious

276
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:28.290
throughout the world. For example,

277
00:14:28.291 --> 00:14:31.230
there are many women who have claimed to have been part of a kind of personal

278
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.590
harem of the Sultan's brother with dozens of them housed within the palace

279
00:14:34.591 --> 00:14:36.390
compound itself and semi confined.

280
00:14:36.391 --> 00:14:39.030
But that being able to communicate with the outside world at all,

281
00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.860
these are women who on many occasions also surprise, surprise,

282
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:47.580
had relations with the Sultan himself. In fact, Jillian Lauren,

283
00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:50.220
one of the former Hiram girls tells of her experience in her book,

284
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.650
some girls where she recounts,

285
00:14:51.651 --> 00:14:55.340
how her life was in these parts and how the girls were used and discarded at

286
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:56.503
well, listen.

287
00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:00.100
<v 3>I have more money than anyone else. I know that they both,</v>

288
00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:03.460
the Salton and Jeffrey had been married and divorced multiple times.

289
00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.350
It's really hypocritical, Jillian Lauren.

290
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.090
<v 0>And of course, she's right. Well,</v>

291
00:15:07.091 --> 00:15:10.780
the Sultan of Brunei also imposes the death penalty by stoning for adultery.

292
00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:13.540
He and his brother had been running wild parties with dozens,

293
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.810
hundreds of Western women for years. In fact, another woman,

294
00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.930
Shannon [inaudible] Mr. United States in 1992, don't, you know,

295
00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.470
she went so far as to the nice, the Sultan in a court in the United States,

296
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:27.250
which eventually dismissed the complaint. Juju has immunity as a head of state,

297
00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.880
however, the case did to help to make her story famous and what she related,

298
00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.840
for example, that she accepted a job in Brunei for $3,000 a day.

299
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:38.680
The ended up being as a sort of Sammy slave for the Sultan's brother Jeffrey,

300
00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:40.510
and for the Sultan himself.

301
00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:45.520
<v 1>It is a great pleasure to welcome my good friend, his majesty, the salt.</v>

302
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:53.200
<v 0>But don't think for one second,</v>

303
00:15:53.201 --> 00:15:56.950
but these two characters are the only party goers involved in scandals scandals

304
00:15:56.951 --> 00:16:00.550
that almost always end with, let's say an unethical waste of money.

305
00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:02.740
Another brother of the self-tan Mohammed bulkier,

306
00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:06.490
who allegedly detested Hasson Allen Jeffrey's wastefulness received a settlement

307
00:16:06.491 --> 00:16:08.350
of $2 billion.

308
00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:12.040
No questions asked when he sees to be minister of foreign affairs and trades in

309
00:16:12.041 --> 00:16:16.900
2015. But I mean, who's not going to shell the disgust for $2 billion,

310
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.090
but just remember though, he really hates waste.

311
00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.850
The fact is that the opulence of the Royal family and their behavior,

312
00:16:21.851 --> 00:16:24.130
which is totally opposed to the teachings of Islam,

313
00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.370
make them probably one of the most hypocritical governments on the international

314
00:16:27.371 --> 00:16:31.420
stage today. And think about what kind of a statement that is.

315
00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:34.480
But not only that, if we add the social stagnation due to the countries,

316
00:16:34.481 --> 00:16:36.280
rent to your model, the lack of freedoms,

317
00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:40.390
the breaches of basic human rights and a Royal family base and wealth,

318
00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:44.710
vice and hypocrisy. What we end up with is modern Brunei,

319
00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.330
but now it's over to you.

320
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.840
What do you think of this curious system whereby Libertas idle laws are applied

321
00:16:49.841 --> 00:16:52.480
to citizens, but not to royalty Wilburn,

322
00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.750
I'll be able to move forward while such a large part of its hydrocarbon revenue

323
00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.610
goes directly to the Royal household.

324
00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:00.460
And will I ever get more followers on Instagram?

325
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.310
So we really hope you enjoyed this video. Please hit a Lake if you did.
