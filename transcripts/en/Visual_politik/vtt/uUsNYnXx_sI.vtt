00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.770
<v 1>Hi, welcome back to visual Baltic. I'm grunt over the past few decades.</v>

2
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.280
Technology has transformed our world radically and in every way,

3
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.780
thanks to technological advances.

4
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.320
The lifestyle we enjoy today has very little to do with the lifestyle that our

5
00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:25.850
parents led, let alone our growth.

6
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.630
<v 0>Parents, things like that.</v>

7
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.760
<v 1>Being able to monitor your pulse in real time,</v>

8
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.090
generate automatic graphs of your cardiac activity through your smartphone

9
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.630
control.

10
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.930
Every last parameter of your physical activity always be connected with your

11
00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:42.020
friends and family or the facts that you can have business meetings from your

12
00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:45.950
beach apartment by video conference would have sounded like madness until just a

13
00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:49.310
few years ago. No, like everything in this world,

14
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.140
it's not all as rosy as it seems.

15
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.260
Technological advancement has also brought with it some dome sites.

16
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.680
And of course,

17
00:00:57.681 --> 00:01:01.700
we can also find double standards as to how States and some multinationals use

18
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:05.060
technology for purposes that are maybe not so good.

19
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.870
Especially when we talk about technologies that allow the monitoring and

20
00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:10.850
tracking of people's activity.

21
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.570
But check out the start of 2020 has been a good example of the potential of new

22
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:21.170
technologies for dealing with health crises, such as the one with SARS cov two,

23
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.760
for example, in many countries,

24
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.870
digital applications are currently being used to track and geo-locate citizens

25
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.660
who may have been in contact with infected persons or places.

26
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.080
<v 2>By voice or location is really apps can determine your risk of</v>

27
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:37.880
coronavirus. But times of Israel.

28
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.510
<v 1>Good example is that, uh, South Korea,</v>

29
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.960
where one of the greatest successes in the prevention of infection and the early

30
00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:49.160
detection of SARS cov two cases has come from the intensive use of technological

31
00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:51.380
means even to controversial limits.

32
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.890
<v 2>South Korea, to impose tracking wristband for defying quarantine orders,</v>

33
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.753
Bloomberg.

34
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.630
<v 1>I think we talk about in great detail and a video we made about how South Korea</v>

35
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.060
has dealt with the Corona virus. The link is in the description.

36
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.120
<v 0>Now.</v>

37
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.630
<v 1>Of course, this use of technology doesn't always go so smoothly.</v>

38
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:14.720
As you can imagine,

39
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.860
such applications and tracking systems may sometimes have flaws. Listen up.

40
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.070
<v 2>Two days, holed up in my bedroom,</v>

41
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.850
thanks to a buggy health ministry virus app times of Israel.

42
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.940
<v 1>Wasting two days in your bedroom may not seem so banned. However,</v>

43
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.260
beyond this kind of anecdotal mess up other much more important dangers lurk,

44
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:38.121
I guess,

45
00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:41.390
problem presented by these new technologies has to do mainly with the new

46
00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:43.850
capacity of States to control their people.

47
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:47.000
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.780
<v 1>Yes. Okay.</v>

49
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.720
You may be watching this from solid democracies from countries where essential

50
00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:53.450
freedoms are guaranteed. And all of this is something that today,

51
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.100
at least for today will not consume.

52
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.100
<v 0>But think how different situation could be.</v>

53
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.800
<v 1>And dictator led countries or by governments with fuse.</v>

54
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.570
<v 0>Triples, it's such cases.</v>

55
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.380
<v 1>These new technological capabilities can become a real weapons of solutions.</v>

56
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.820
<v 0>Control sync.</v>

57
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.510
<v 1>For example,</v>

58
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.800
in the case of you guessed to China using the Corona virus as an excuse,

59
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.940
the government has extended and generalized geolocation systems that are highly

60
00:03:23.941 --> 00:03:28.350
intrusive and people's private lives systems that have gone far beyond simply.

61
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.273
<v 0>Tracking.</v>

62
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.270
<v 1>Taking advantage of this crisis to boost social codes that have existed for some</v>

63
00:03:36.271 --> 00:03:37.280
years, such as the new.

64
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.070
<v 0>Hell's coat. These are codes.</v>

65
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.270
<v 1>The rate individuals based on certain parameters and determine whether or not</v>

66
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:47.130
those individuals can do certain things.

67
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.070
<v 0>Things as crazy.</v>

68
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.460
<v 1>Is that my son, but what does all this really mean? Where's the danger?</v>

69
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.370
Are they temporary measures or will they become permanent?

70
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.160
Even once the coronavirus crisis is no longer a threat.

71
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.530
What can the Chinese government do with these new identification and geolocation.

72
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.950
<v 0>Technologies to learn more about this issue.</v>

73
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.910
<v 1>This video,</v>

74
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.360
we are going to tell you how technology is also changing the way States

75
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.670
governments are monitoring our lives.

76
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.850
And this way we will try to address the risks that may arise.

77
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.890
<v 0>No, no, no.</v>

78
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.660
<v 1>I don't think we're just going to talk to you about China. Believe me.</v>

79
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.890
I bet there are things you're going to hear in this video are going to amaze you.

80
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.070
<v 0>China from dictatorship to police state.</v>

81
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.170
<v 1>No,</v>

82
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.680
I'm sure many of you have heard the China has one of the most advanced social

83
00:04:43.681 --> 00:04:45.480
surveillance technologies in the world,

84
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.600
especially when we consider their application on a massive scale.

85
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.463
<v 0>Something.</v>

86
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.280
<v 1>During the coronavirus pandemic to establish systems of surveillance,</v>

87
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.380
restrictions and prohibitions, like never.

88
00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.333
<v 0>For before.</v>

89
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.560
<v 1>For example, about the infamous health code,</v>

90
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.130
which uses the colors of a traffic light to classify people according to whether

91
00:05:08.131 --> 00:05:10.290
or not they have recovered from the Corona virus,

92
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.930
whether they have had any contact with people who had it,

93
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.480
or whether they've visited high risk areas.

94
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.870
This system was initially developed by the hung zoo, local government,

95
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.830
but has spread throughout the country. It is currently installed on Weechat,

96
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.130
Chinese WhatsApp and Ali pay. Alibaba is payment platform.

97
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.713
<v 0>Well, as we.</v>

98
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.780
<v 1>Chat and Wickson, it's Chinese version have 1.1,</v>

99
00:05:33.781 --> 00:05:37.170
6 million users and Ali pay about 900 million.

100
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.590
We can say that virtually all Chinese citizens have at least one of those two

101
00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:43.230
applications that they use every day. Well,

102
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.410
many functions have been restricted or conditioned by the health code.

103
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.720
<v 0>But how.</v>

104
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.850
<v 1>Exactly does this traffic late talking of citizens.</v>

105
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:51.923
<v 0>Work?</v>

106
00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.500
<v 1>Let's see, there are several ways on the hand,</v>

107
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.660
if health authorities determined that you have,

108
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:03.440
or recently had the coronavirus or that you've been in contact with an infected

109
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:05.990
person, then you will be given the rent status.

110
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.210
Then if contact is not so obvious,

111
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.690
you just also have to fill out a questionnaire, which combined with other data,

112
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.580
such as geolocation through mobiles,

113
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.810
determines your chances of having been exposed or having been close to the

114
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:21.644
virus.

115
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.130
And this way you could be classified as yellow or at best as green,

116
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.040
the green color is the one that gives you almost absolute freedom within the

117
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:34.040
current restrictions. And look,

118
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.130
don't think for a moment that it's something only used by a few,

119
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.170
not at all in China,

120
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.860
these health codes are being used for almost everything to allow access to the

121
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:45.950
subway, to go shopping, to go to a restaurant, to a cafe,

122
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.370
even to authorize payments for plane or train tickets

123
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.390
and short life.

124
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.260
The freedom of many people now revolves around the color they have been

125
00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.940
assigned. Yes, this may seem like a story taken from black mirror,

126
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.270
but what we're telling you is what's already working. There's no Saifai here.

127
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.130
Surely many of you are thinking, but what's wrong with all this.

128
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.023
At the end of the day,

129
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.640
it's a really effective tool for fighting the Corona virus.

130
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.490
Isn't that what's made China so successful in controlling the spread of the

131
00:07:16.491 --> 00:07:20.450
pandemic. Well,

132
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.860
let's see the problem is,

133
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.250
and the indiscriminate use that our government can make of these tools.

134
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.820
Indeed, the use of such technologies in China to control or restrict freedoms.

135
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.850
It's not something that is only a resident as a result of the coronavirus

136
00:07:34.851 --> 00:07:37.040
crisis. And of course, as we all know,

137
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.240
China is not exactly the poster child for human rights and civil liberties.

138
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.470
It's more like the opposite. In fact,

139
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.340
what seems to be happening is that the Corona virus is being used as the perfect

140
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:53.720
excuse to popularize and perpetuate measures as controversial or sensitive.

141
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.010
As these check out.

142
00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.470
<v 2>China is installing surveillance cameras outside people's front doors,</v>

143
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.370
and sometimes inside their homes. After a trip to Southern China,

144
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.900
the 34 year old Irish ex-pat and his family were starting their two week home

145
00:08:07.901 --> 00:08:08.590
quarantine,

146
00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:12.790
a mandatory measure enforced by the Beijing government to stop the spread of the

147
00:08:12.791 --> 00:08:14.020
novel coronavirus.

148
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.500
You said he opened the door as the camera was being installed. Without warning,

149
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.760
having a camera outside your door is an incredible erosion of privacy.

150
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:24.790
And I don't know how much of it is actually legal CNN.

151
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:28.570
<v 1>Cameras, even on the front door at home. Are you surprised? Well,</v>

152
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.463
you shouldn't be

153
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:35.050
the things that are being put into practice during this health crisis have been

154
00:08:35.051 --> 00:08:40.030
in the pipeline for many years. Indeed.

155
00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:43.750
China has cities where it is virtually impossible to escape the eyes of the

156
00:08:43.751 --> 00:08:46.060
authorities. To give you an idea. Nationally,

157
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:50.380
there are about 200 million surveillance cameras and some cities have literally

158
00:08:50.381 --> 00:08:52.240
become a kind of begged brother set,

159
00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.470
For example, and this idea of brace yourself,

160
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.250
cause I'm going to butcher this Chung yang,

161
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.390
the most monitored setting on the planet 2019 ended with over two and a half

162
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.870
million surveillance cameras for 15.5, 3 million inhabitants.

163
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.600
That is one camera for every 5.9. Okay.

164
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:13.123
<v 0>Habitats.</v>

165
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.820
<v 1>The most troubling thing from the point of view of privacy and freedom are</v>

166
00:09:19.821 --> 00:09:23.150
advances in facial recognition techniques for surveillance purposes,

167
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.600
a subject in which China is the undisputed leader worldwide.

168
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:27.463
<v 0>Right?</v>

169
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:31.970
<v 1>Well take for example, brace yourself,</v>

170
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.570
Zang zoo and industrial setting located in the central part of the country.

171
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:40.130
<v 0>Here.</v>

172
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.670
<v 1>Authorities have massively combined video surveillance with Telekom tracking to</v>

173
00:09:43.671 --> 00:09:47.300
create one of the most advanced and accurate facial detection systems in the

174
00:09:47.301 --> 00:09:48.134
world.

175
00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:50.870
<v 0>And how does it work?</v>

176
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:51.200
<v 1>Well,</v>

177
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.010
the police have white boxes that are mobile antenna trackers installed next to

178
00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:55.850
many of the surveillance.

179
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.990
And this way the image is captured by the cameras can match people's faces with

180
00:10:02.991 --> 00:10:06.560
their mobile phones and their geo positioning so that the system can determine

181
00:10:06.561 --> 00:10:09.890
whether the person detected by the camera is really the one. And that.

182
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:10.993
<v 0>Please.</v>

183
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.600
<v 1>The question is what does the Chinese regime want? All this technology?</v>

184
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:21.440
<v 0>Well.</v>

185
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:22.760
<v 1>You find a clue to what weights,</v>

186
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.720
the Chinese and the near future and the coastal city of wrong champ. Once again,

187
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.140
I apologize to any Chinese people watching I'm Scottish. I barely speak English.

188
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:33.380
<v 0>Hello.</v>

189
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:37.500
<v 1>Works is that each of the 670,000 inhabitants of the city of Rome,</v>

190
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:41.660
Chang receives 1000 citizen points and depending on how they behave and what

191
00:10:41.661 --> 00:10:44.360
they do, they can lose or Aaron points. For example,

192
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.640
you're fighting with your neighbor five points deducted.

193
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.100
Don't do what you have to do when you take the dog out 10 points,

194
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.440
go donate blood. And five more points.

195
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:55.550
Of course you can forget speaking out against the authorities or make any

196
00:10:55.551 --> 00:10:59.090
negative comments about the political economic or social situation of the

197
00:10:59.091 --> 00:11:03.050
country, because then things could get very, very complicated for you.

198
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.393
<v 0>Very fast.</v>

199
00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:09.501
<v 1>Like the system,</v>

200
00:11:09.501 --> 00:11:13.550
the authorities have set a rent list of actions and activities and daily life

201
00:11:13.551 --> 00:11:17.930
that may or may not be undertaken depending on the number of points you have.

202
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.810
For example, if you lose a certain level of points,

203
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.400
then your most basic freedoms,

204
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:26.060
such as mobility begin to be restricted and watch out because we're talking

205
00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:30.050
about a system that could prevent you from accessing a bank loan or even booking.

206
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:31.303
<v 0>Green tickets.</v>

207
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.880
<v 1>You sink, it seems a bit crazy, doesn't it? Well,</v>

208
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:39.320
they're pilot schemes at the moment,

209
00:11:39.321 --> 00:11:42.770
but the risk of them being rolled out across the country seem to be increasing

210
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.550
each day.

211
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:47.210
And that's skating with the Chinese government's use of these technologies.

212
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.110
The Chinese dictatorship could always know we're an opponent or simply a suspect

213
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.070
in one might be.

214
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.630
They could also know precisely what people they have met with and what places

215
00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:56.141
they frequent.

216
00:11:56.141 --> 00:11:59.620
I guess you can get an idea of what this may mean in terms of individual

217
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:01.360
freedoms. Overall, it's not looking at.

218
00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:02.243
<v 0>Good.</v>

219
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.680
<v 1>If this seems like something incredible that could only happen in countries like</v>

220
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:08.670
China. Well,

221
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:12.030
you may be surprised to learn that in countries that we consider free,

222
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:15.630
the use of surveillance technologies for social monitoring is not as rare or as

223
00:12:15.631 --> 00:12:18.300
uncommon as we might originally think. Let's take a look.

224
00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:29.130
<v 0>Troll a universal vice. So first of all.</v>

225
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:29.850
<v 1>A question,</v>

226
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.690
do you think it's justified to undermine the privacy of people in public spaces

227
00:12:33.691 --> 00:12:35.040
and exchange for greater.

228
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:35.963
<v 0>Security?</v>

229
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:40.290
<v 1>No, this is a complex issue.</v>

230
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.860
And the truth is that I don't think there was a clear answer to any of this.

231
00:12:43.861 --> 00:12:47.640
There are people who prioritize privacy and freedom above all else and others

232
00:12:47.641 --> 00:12:49.290
who would say that security is much more.

233
00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:53.280
<v 0>However.</v>

234
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.360
<v 1>Other things we are seeing today,</v>

235
00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:58.230
even outside China make us wonder whether perhaps the path has been set in some

236
00:12:58.231 --> 00:13:00.630
countries is not exactly the most appropriate.

237
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:01.463
<v 0>Yes.</v>

238
00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.710
<v 1>Several countries considered free and democratic such as the United States or</v>

239
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:09.270
especially the United Kingdom,

240
00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.430
which you're also trying to develop Chinese style.

241
00:13:11.431 --> 00:13:14.700
Facial detection systems who'd look in the UK, we've all got terrible teeth.

242
00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:18.930
We'll see how that works. Of course today,

243
00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:21.990
the limitations of technology fortunately, or unfortunately,

244
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.540
depending on whoever is looking at it are still very sick.

245
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.793
<v 0>Okay.</v>

246
00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.730
<v 1>A test conducted by the police in South Wales and the United Kingdom with a</v>

247
00:13:32.731 --> 00:13:35.130
camera detection system called Neo face,

248
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.900
determined that during the 55 hours and operation of the 2,900 possible marches,

249
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:42.480
only 145 were real positive.

250
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:46.740
That means only 145 were posted the facial surveys of the right person.

251
00:13:46.741 --> 00:13:47.330
See what I mean.

252
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.163
<v 0>About the teeth?</v>

253
00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.750
<v 1>It's clear that this technological gap can be closed very quickly. Listen up.</v>

254
00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:00.060
<v 2>London police are taking surveillance to a whole new level London's police</v>

255
00:14:00.061 --> 00:14:04.320
department said that it would begin using facial recognition to spot criminal

256
00:14:04.321 --> 00:14:07.350
suspects with video cameras. As they walk the streets,

257
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:12.090
adopting a level of surveillance that is rare outside China, the New York times,

258
00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:14.040
you did hear that.

259
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:14.963
<v 0>Correctly.</v>

260
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:22.290
<v 1>The British capital wants to make use of more than the 627,000 surveillance</v>

261
00:14:22.291 --> 00:14:23.700
cameras spread throughout the city.

262
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:27.480
The largest infrastructure of this cane on the entire European continent.

263
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.390
We're talking about 68 cameras for every one site.

264
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:31.463
<v 0>Londoners.</v>

265
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.990
<v 1>Clearly the result of the use of these systems will not be the same in the</v>

266
00:14:36.991 --> 00:14:40.710
country like the United Kingdom as an autocratic, China, but privacy,

267
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:42.870
privacy seems increasingly doomed.

268
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.720
And that forces us to ask ourselves a few questions.

269
00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.590
Is it justified to expand video surveillance in the name of security and to

270
00:14:49.591 --> 00:14:51.120
every corner of our lanes?

271
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.230
Should we accept that governments be provided with the localization data from

272
00:14:54.231 --> 00:14:57.800
our smartphones to eventually resolve a crime what's more important to you,

273
00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.420
security or privacy?

274
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.540
Is it possible to reach a happy medium or do you think there will always be a

275
00:15:02.541 --> 00:15:06.860
tendency to monitor more and more and more and an upcoming video we'll look in

276
00:15:06.861 --> 00:15:10.400
detail at some such plans put in place by some of the world's most powerful

277
00:15:10.401 --> 00:15:12.980
governments, but at the moment, we'd love to know your opinion.
