00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.050
<v 0>This video is brought to you by news voice, the news.</v>

2
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.360
<v 1>He's broken almost all us media is owned by just a handful of big corporations.</v>

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.550
Fake news is obviously a huge problem as well.

4
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.440
And finding something unbiased can be hard.

5
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.780

given some much needed balance. Each new story shows multiple sources,

9
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.750
which are all tagged with their bias and perspective.

10
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.680
The news affects almost everything in our lives. What we hear and read shapes,

11
00:00:30.681 --> 00:00:34.130
which persons we trust, what we eat, what we buy, how we vote,

12
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.460
and even how we think news voice is created by its readers.

13
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.150
As you can vote stories that you find interesting. So more people will see them.

18
00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:58.130
on both Google play and Apple app store. And let's get into the video.

19
00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.173
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.450
<v 1>2020 Is advancing as fast as the Corona virus is spreading.</v>

21
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.020
Then the third is getting closer and closer.

22
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.840
That means the U S election is coming up.

23
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.010
Friends going to the polls after a president's first term is always kind of like

24
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.950
a referendum on how the current administration is doing.

25
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.790
But if we also take into account the enormous role that the current tenant of

26
00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:33.680
the white house has played during this term,

27
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.550
then we find that these elections promised to be a referendum on Donald Trump

28
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:41.060
himself and difference of visual politics. Donald J.

29
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.690
Trump is at the time of making this video going through one of his worst periods

30
00:01:44.691 --> 00:01:45.524
as president.

31
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.030
He faces a pandemic with more than 165,000 debt with economic hardships,

32
00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:51.680
for millions who have lost their jobs.

33
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.640
And with the streets filled with massive protests against institutional racism

34
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.720
for one reason or another.

35
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.410
The fact is that the end of his term is proving to be worse than anyone could

36
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:01.244
ever have imagined.

37
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.420
So in view of this, I think it's time to take a look at the alternative.

38
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.510
Let's see what the democratic party and its presidential candidate,

39
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.460
Joseph Robinette Biden Jr.

40
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.180
Better known as Joe Biden have to offer a bomber's form.

41
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.210
Former vice-president seems to be a bet on moderation, a bet on stability,

42
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.570
but who exactly is Joe Biden? How long has he been in politics?

43
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.000
What exactly does he stand for more importantly,

44
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.760
what can he bring to the United States on visual politics today?

45
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.740
We are going to answer all these questions,

46
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.350
but first we're going to take a look back at some history.

47
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.060
<v 0>A lifetime in politics.</v>

48
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.620
<v 1>Joe Biden is a native of Scranton, Pennsylvania,</v>

49
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.340
a super boring little town that became famous as the setting for the popular

50
00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:52.190
comedy series, the office, if you haven't seen it, write that one down.

51
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.790
Joe Biden is the perfect example of what it means to be a professional

52
00:02:55.791 --> 00:02:59.180
politician. In fact, it is said that when he was a baby, he didn't cry.

53
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.070
He gave speeches.

54
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.800
And if Bernie Sanders has been in politics for half of his life,

55
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.620
Biden can go one better before becoming vice president.

56
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.550
He was a Senator for the state of Delaware and no less than 36 years.

57
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.510
Just to give you an idea.

58
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.020
He took office almost as soon as he celebrated his 30th birthday,

59
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.470
which by the way, is the minimum age required to be a United States,

60
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:20.320
Senator and friends. Since he first sat in the Senator chair,

61
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.780
he did not budge until 2009.

62
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.500
When he became a bombers vice-president during his eight years in the white

63
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:30.850
house. But let's start back at the beginning.

64
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.950
Joe Biden was born in 1942 a time when battles like Guadalcanal or Stalingrad

65
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.540
were being fought around the world.

66
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.970
He was the first born of an Irish Catholic family.

67
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.620
And when Joe was just 10 years old,

68
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.010
the Biden family sought to improve their economic situation by moving to

69
00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:48.490
Claymont a town in Delaware where Joe completed his studies before going to

70
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:51.700
college, it was here that Biden spent most of the 1960s.

71
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.600
He first did a double major in history and political science at the university

72
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:58.090
of Delaware, and then went on to study law at the Sierra.

73
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.830
<v 0>University. And of course.</v>

74
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.580
<v 1>Leave the stereotypes. And you add university life duties, his Irish background,</v>

75
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.810
you would perhaps imagine a young Biden going on a binge of debauchery paved in

76
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.220
alcohol, wouldn't you? Well,

77
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.970
no that wasn't the case because Biden doesn't drink, which we celebrate,

78
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.880
but which on the other hand is no guarantee of anything I've ever.

79
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.100
<v 2>America will have a T total or president and either Donald Trump or Joe Biden.</v>

80
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.170
<v 1>The fact is that in 1969,</v>

81
00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.070
after his college years Biden began working as a lawyer at about the same time.

82
00:04:29.071 --> 00:04:33.210
He also began his political activity in the democratic party as a member of the

83
00:04:33.211 --> 00:04:37.050
new castle County council. We're talking about the year 1970.

84
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.320
This was the first step before launching his candidacy for the Senate.

85
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.780
Just two years later in the elections of 72,

86
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.240
Those were bad times for the democratic party,

87
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.400
but young Biden achieved the impossible.

88
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.610
He took over the post from a very experienced Republican Senator.

89
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.750
That's a time when Richard Nixon was taking the presidential elections by storm.

90
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.390
<v 2>Biden is not an academic. He's not a theoretical thinker. He's a great St. Paul.</v>

91
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.320
He comes from a long line of working people in Scranton auto salesman,

92
00:05:07.321 --> 00:05:11.820
car dealers, people who know how to make a sale. He has that great Irish gift,

93
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.850
Howard Fineman, former chief political correspondent at noon.

94
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.440
<v 1>Unfortunately, however,</v>

95
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.430
a joy in the Biden household quickly faded before he even took office.

96
00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:24.660
As Senator Biden's wife was in a car accident that cost the lives of herself and

97
00:05:24.661 --> 00:05:28.530
her daughter. The accident also puts the other two Biden children in hospital.

98
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.040
At this point, it is said that good old Joe was on the verge of resigning,

99
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.030
but the Democrats insisted that he continue making it into the Senate before the

100
00:05:36.031 --> 00:05:38.310
Republican roll call was a symbol of change.

101
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.090
And the new generation of politicians would have to prevail in the post Nixon

102
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.953
era.

103
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.950
<v 2>Politics is a matter of personal honor. A man's word is his bond.</v>

104
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.130
You give your word, you keep it. If you do politics the right way,

105
00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.740
I believe you can actually make people's lives better.

106
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.250
And integrity is the minimum ante to get into the game, Joe Biden,

107
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.113
but let's keep.

108
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.060
<v 1>In 1997, he became chairman of the Senate judiciary committee,</v>

109
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.240
a period that he took advantage of to push through tough legislation,

110
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.170
to combat crime,

111
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.950
organized crime and drug trafficking legislation that even included the death

112
00:06:11.951 --> 00:06:12.430
penalty.

113
00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.570
This is certainly noteworthy since he now proposes abolishing the death penalty,

114
00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.130
of course thinking is evolving naturally. It does, by the way, in 1991,

115
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.800
he also conducted to the investigations of the candidates.

116
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.280
Clarence Thomas ahead of his appointment as judge of the Supreme court,

117
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.300
Thomas will undoubtedly go down in history for his harsh tone against Anita

118
00:06:31.301 --> 00:06:34.630
Hill. The woman who accused the later confirmed judge of sexual harassment.

119
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.920
<v 0>To this day,</v>

120
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.000
I regret I couldn't come up with a way to get her a kind of hearing.

121
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.050
She deserved given the courage he showed by reaching out to us

122
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:46.743
in any case.

123
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.010
<v 1>It is not change is Biden's objective because Biden always had one destination</v>

124
00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:52.450
in mind, the white house,

125
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:56.621
You know,

126
00:06:56.621 --> 00:07:01.240
when Biden announced his first democratic primary run way back in 1987,

127
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.330
well positioned for his restraint and with an ability to raise funds for his

128
00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:08.290
campaign Biden, nevertheless lasted barely two and a half months in the race.

129
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.070
He was accused of copying speeches by British labor politicians and even

130
00:07:12.071 --> 00:07:13.450
president Kennedy himself.

131
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.380
When it became public that he had already had incidents of plagiarism during his

132
00:07:17.381 --> 00:07:20.260
university days, Biden had no choice, but to pull out.

133
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.190
<v 0>The race such as life.</v>

134
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:29.770
<v 1>These luck changed again.</v>

135
00:07:29.771 --> 00:07:33.850
When the new century brought him the chairmanship of the powerful Senate foreign

136
00:07:33.851 --> 00:07:37.450
affairs committee Biden had been a strong advocate of military intervention in

137
00:07:37.451 --> 00:07:40.480
the Balkans against Milosevic after the nine 11 attacks.

138
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.440
He did not hesitate in working with the Republican administration of George W.

139
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.220
Bush to support the attack on the Taliban in Afghanistan first and later on

140
00:07:48.221 --> 00:07:50.290
Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq.

141
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.840
And although he later acknowledged that he was wrong,

142
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.720
this can be read into ways for critics of the war,

143
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.670
a majority group in the democratic party.

144
00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:01.450
It is clear that he was wrong and it is a burden on him. But on the other hand,

145
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.170
it shows us a politician who has no problem working with the Republicans to

146
00:08:05.171 --> 00:08:09.460
reach consensus and that that's in the current times, couldn't be a very,

147
00:08:09.461 --> 00:08:11.290
very valuable asset as we will see.

148
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:14.860
<v 0>In 2000.</v>

149
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.770
<v 1>Biden relaunched his candidacy for the democratic party,</v>

150
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.720
but he didn't make it past the first vote.

151
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:23.530
He came in fifth in Iowa and saw that he had no chance against candidates like

152
00:08:23.531 --> 00:08:25.690
Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. However,

153
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:29.320
Obama who had barely been in Washington for three years as a Senator bet on

154
00:08:29.321 --> 00:08:33.370
Biden's experience his moderation and his knowledge of foreign policy to offer

155
00:08:33.371 --> 00:08:36.100
him the spot on his ticket as a candidacy for vice versa.

156
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:40.000
<v 0>And the tree.</v>

157
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.760
<v 1>If he's there, he was a very popular vice-president and yet, well,</v>

158
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:43.511
let's be honest.

159
00:08:43.511 --> 00:08:47.200
Biden's profile would have been very badly received four years ago in an

160
00:08:47.201 --> 00:08:49.420
election dominated by Trump. In other words,

161
00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:53.440
he would have been no match for a popular businessman who appears on TV facing

162
00:08:53.441 --> 00:08:56.880
off against the political cost that is pulling the strings in Washington.

163
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.620
However, in November,

164
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.350
2020 is moderate approach and all his experience in management,

165
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:05.580
maybe Biden's main selling points in these times of coronavirus and crisis.

166
00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:09.440
<v 0>The.</v>

167
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.680
<v 1>It will be a true referendum on Trump and the alternative to the current tenants</v>

168
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:16.520
of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is the Pennsylvania man,

169
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.200
Joseph Robinette Biden Jr.

170
00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:22.100
A politician well-known to all Americans who promises to leave behind the

171
00:09:22.101 --> 00:09:26.210
tumultuous era of the Trump administration and who will also have the support of

172
00:09:26.211 --> 00:09:30.290
those nostalgic for Obama. And of course the former president himself.

173
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.530
<v 3>The kind of leadership that's guided by knowledge and experience,</v>

174
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:37.100
honesty and humility, empathy, and grace,

175
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:41.060
that kind of leadership doesn't just belong in our state capitals and mayor's

176
00:09:41.061 --> 00:09:41.894
offices.

177
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:46.970
It belongs in the white house and that's why I'm so proud to endorse Joe Biden

178
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.860
for president of the United States.

179
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:54.950
<v 1>If the death of his first born son took him away from the 2016 presidential</v>

180
00:09:54.951 --> 00:09:57.470
elections. Now after two failed attempts,

181
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.370
he has a real opportunity to finally take his place in the oval office.

182
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.030
<v 0>Of course.</v>

183
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:08.690
<v 1>Well, some people wonder if Biden isn't a little too late to the party because</v>

184
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:10.580
friends, if he does win the election,

185
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:14.630
he will be 78 years old when he takes the office 78 years,

186
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:19.040
which by the way is about the same as the average life expectancy in the United

187
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.800
States. It's certainly an advanced age by any standards.

188
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.340
Of course the alternative is not so different at 74.

189
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:29.840
Trump is along with Reagan, the oldest president seeking re-election friends.

190
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.930
It's clear that this is no game for the young, the times are progressing.

191
00:10:32.931 --> 00:10:36.800
And certainly don't think that such an advanced age necessarily implies having

192
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:40.430
old fashioned ideas as movements have emerged within the democratic party.

193
00:10:40.431 --> 00:10:41.240
Biden has.

194
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.020
How shall I put it step to the left to keep up with the times listen app?

195
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:49.610
<v 0>I shouldn't say it on time. Um, I, I like speed</v>

196
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.273
sounds good

197
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.170
strengths in unity.

198
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.710
<v 1>At first glance, Biden might not be the best candidate in the world.</v>

199
00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.830
You only have to see him for a minute to know that he is not the life of the

200
00:11:12.831 --> 00:11:15.140
party or the best person to mobilize voters.

201
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.750
But at this time that's kind of working in his favor.

202
00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:21.350
The health and economic crisis caused by the Corona virus has worn Trump down,

203
00:11:21.351 --> 00:11:25.850
much more than his usual eccentricities and outbursts were ever able to do.

204
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.420
Let's not forget. That's the presidential team that takes the office in January.

205
00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:33.020
We'll have to deal with the destruction of the 42 million jobs caused by the

206
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.420
Corona virus. So far a huge budget hole,

207
00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:39.140
courtesy of four years of the Trump administration and a rather complicated

208
00:11:39.141 --> 00:11:41.000
international relationship. Yes,

209
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:44.690
the current situation is terrible for the United States, but friends for Biden,

210
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.710
it's quite an opportunity.

211
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:50.560
<v 0>Biden camp finds selling point in alien economy. His work on 2009.</v>

212
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.740
<v 1>Similarly,</v>

213
00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:55.150
the Obama administration was faced with the effects of the great recession as

214
00:11:55.151 --> 00:11:56.200
soon as it took office.

215
00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.590
And vice-president Biden was personally responsible for administering the

216
00:11:59.591 --> 00:12:01.600
stimulus launched by the white house,

217
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.900
a stimulus plan of nearly $800 billion.

218
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.860
So Biden can trade on the fact that he has already faced a scenario like this

219
00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:10.600
and that things didn't turn out so badly.

220
00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:14.940
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

221
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.820
<v 1>Of course, despite whether you agree with this kind of policy or not,</v>

222
00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:22.350
we can't deny that such experience is a better credential than virtually any

223
00:12:22.351 --> 00:12:23.850
speech a candidate could make,

224
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.300
especially when you're not the most skillful at choosing words, take,

225
00:12:27.301 --> 00:12:30.600
for example, what happened to Biden when he talked about violence against women?

226
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.410
<v 4>No,</v>

227
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:36.300
man has a right to raise a hand to a woman in anger

228
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.870
other than in self-defense and that's rarely ever occurs.

229
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:44.580
And so we have to just change the culture period and keep punching at it and

230
00:12:44.581 --> 00:12:46.140
punching and punching it.

231
00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.460
<v 1>You couldn't come up with any better word.</v>

232
00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:54.930
So what is the biggest potential obstacle facing Obama's former vice president?

233
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.320
Well,

234
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.520
the Hillary Clinton effect that is that's what happened in 2016 will happen

235
00:12:59.521 --> 00:13:03.360
again when a good part of Sanders democratic supporters refuse to vote for the

236
00:13:03.361 --> 00:13:06.660
Democrats and a few even voted for Trump. But then again,

237
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.130
things have changed in 2016.

238
00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.020
On one hand, let's be honest.

239
00:13:13.021 --> 00:13:17.280
There's nothing uniting the democratic party more right now than the desire to

240
00:13:17.281 --> 00:13:19.830
avoid four more years of Trump. And on the other hand,

241
00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:23.640
because Biden could end up offering a candidacy more to the left than Hillary

242
00:13:23.641 --> 00:13:24.450
Clinton offered.

243
00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:27.780
This is something that we've discussed in previous visual politic videos,

244
00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:32.040
the great success of Sanders Warren and rising stars like Acacia Cortez would be

245
00:13:32.041 --> 00:13:35.640
to move the democratic party much further to the left and exchange for their

246
00:13:35.641 --> 00:13:39.720
support. That is their votes. And it seems that's exactly what has happened.

247
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:40.440
For example,

248
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.400
Hillary Clinton's proposals to expand the healthcare program known as Obamacare

249
00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:49.140
were to cost $200 billion over 10 years by didn't put nearly four times as much

250
00:13:49.141 --> 00:13:52.470
on the table with plans reaching $750 billion.

251
00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:55.590
Another difference is that the Democrats no longer label initiatives,

252
00:13:55.591 --> 00:14:00.390
such as doubling the minimum wage as radical a $15 an hour minimum

253
00:14:00.391 --> 00:14:02.700
wage as long overdue, but it's just the start.

254
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:06.390
We have to make sure every single worker receives the pay and dignity they

255
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:07.591
deserve and friends,

256
00:14:07.591 --> 00:14:12.030
let's not fool ourselves in this pandemic era defending and even expanding

257
00:14:12.031 --> 00:14:15.570
Obamacare could be a very, very popular drawcard. Then again,

258
00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:19.440
getting close to the proposals in Sanders manifesto would require several

259
00:14:19.441 --> 00:14:22.530
federal budgets to support that much spending. In fact,

260
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.010
it was precisely the radicalism of Vermont socialist candidates that led

261
00:14:26.011 --> 00:14:29.880
moderate democratic candidates to withdraw from the primaries race in order to

262
00:14:29.881 --> 00:14:32.640
clear the way for the more moderate Biden. And yes,

263
00:14:32.641 --> 00:14:35.640
it is true that Biden's positions are still far from those of Sanders,

264
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:38.490
but they clearly have moved closer. So the question is,

265
00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.430
how does Biden expect to finance his campaign promises?

266
00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:44.280
Is he going to raise taxes? Well, yes, he will.

267
00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.820
At least that's what he's advocating in a very moderate way. Of course,

268
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.870
Biden is proposing to restore the highest tax rate to 39.6%.

269
00:14:56.871 --> 00:15:00.770
For those earning over $400,000, Trump lowered it to 37%.

270
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:05.840
He also pledges to raise corporate tax from 21% to 28%. Whereas before Trump,

271
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:07.910
it was 35%. In any case,

272
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.870
what is not in his plan is to boost public spending as much as Sanders advocated

273
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:16.040
or to adopt debatable economic theories that could have serious consequences for

274
00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:18.110
inflation. Like the modern monetary theory.

275
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:21.280
<v 0>Know.</v>

276
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:25.000
<v 1>Perhaps raising taxes too much in these times of economic crisis just may not be</v>

277
00:15:25.001 --> 00:15:28.270
the best idea, but as you can see, his measures are far from radical.

278
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.823
And as we all know,

279
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:36.730
campaigns are one thing and the presidency is quite another because in this

280
00:15:36.731 --> 00:15:37.151
election,

281
00:15:37.151 --> 00:15:40.660
Biden may have to pitch his speeches more to the left than he would like to in

282
00:15:40.661 --> 00:15:42.640
order to ensure the vote of Sanders and company.

283
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:46.810
But the truth is that Biden has always represented the ideological center of the

284
00:15:46.811 --> 00:15:49.690
Democrats. In fact, he was a Senator for Delaware,

285
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:53.590
a state that many accused of being a tax Haven and which we recently talked

286
00:15:53.591 --> 00:15:55.990
about here on visual politic. I'll leave you with Lincoln,

287
00:15:55.991 --> 00:15:59.410
the description friends for out a very, very long political career,

288
00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.130
but I didn't have defended conservative positions on abortion on some racial

289
00:16:03.131 --> 00:16:06.280
issues. And as we mentioned earlier, he not only defended,

290
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:09.550
but proposed a strong hand in fighting crime. In other words,

291
00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.360
he ticked all the boxes to be a majority candidate in the United States,

292
00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.970
but of course, as the center of the party moved to the left.

293
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.610
So did he have that, that brings us straight to the key question.

294
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:23.320
What can we really expect if Joe Biden becomes the 46th president of the United

295
00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.153
States? Well, let's see.

296
00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:30.940
<v 0>Joe Biden's America.</v>

297
00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:37.240
<v 1>Slight tax increases much more health spending stimulus plans and the push to</v>

298
00:16:37.241 --> 00:16:40.870
raise the minimum wage. These are his main promises so far in economic matters,

299
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.330
but what would Biden's America look like? Well,

300
00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:46.150
probably his first goal would be to undo what Trump has done.

301
00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:50.200
This would include restoring the U S prominence among Western democracies and a

302
00:16:50.201 --> 00:16:53.770
return to the multilateral strategy on the international stage.

303
00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:57.250
I'm sure many Asian countries would be glad to see someone in Washington.

304
00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.950
Finally looking beyond America. First in addition,

305
00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.610
Biden has already spoken of returning to the nuclear agreement with Iran and of

306
00:17:03.611 --> 00:17:06.970
signing the Paris agreement. Thank God. And of course, domestically,

307
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.880
as you could imagine, his choice would also have consequences.

308
00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:14.950
For example,

309
00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:18.280
the white house would almost certainly softened its discourse on illegal

310
00:17:18.281 --> 00:17:19.390
immigration. In fact,

311
00:17:19.391 --> 00:17:23.170
Biden wants to offer a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented

312
00:17:23.171 --> 00:17:25.390
immigrants already living in the United States.

313
00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:30.070
But a revolution cannot be expected either if the legislative elections of two

314
00:17:30.071 --> 00:17:33.550
years ago proved anything. It's that in order to regain the presidency,

315
00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.160
Democrats must attack from the center. If Biden wins,

316
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:39.670
he will surely dominates the house of representatives butts to have a majority

317
00:17:39.671 --> 00:17:40.450
in the Senate.

318
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.290
Democrats would need to snatch three of the 23 Republican Senator seats that

319
00:17:44.291 --> 00:17:45.580
will be in play in November.

320
00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.340
And to have a super majority that would undo a blockage,

321
00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.870
he would need more no less than 13 of those 23 senators,

322
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:53.700
a totally unlikely scenario,

323
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.610
unless there's an outright to the buckle for Trump and the Republican yeah.

324
00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:57.853
<v 0>Party.</v>

325
00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.970
<v 1>Hold on a minute because while it may surprise us,</v>

326
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.430
the truth is that Biden is counting on the Republicans.

327
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:08.000
It seems that his bet is after a hypothetical defeat of the current president,

328
00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.610
the Republican party would recover a more centrist tone.

329
00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:13.490
And let's not forget that he himself has always stood out as the type of

330
00:18:13.491 --> 00:18:17.150
politician capable of bringing Democrats and Republicans together to push

331
00:18:17.151 --> 00:18:20.630
through legislation. So the key question is what could he accomplish now?

332
00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:21.733
<v 0>Well.</v>

333
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:25.580
<v 1>Well, if you remember the video on Mitt Romney,</v>

334
00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:29.300
the Obamacare program was basically inspired by the earlier healthcare reform

335
00:18:29.301 --> 00:18:33.050
agreement between Republicans and Democrats in the state of Massachusetts.

336
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:36.290
And if we add to that, to the impact of the current Corona virus pandemic,

337
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:36.800
I don't know,

338
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.550
it just doesn't seem like fantasy to think that any representative of the

339
00:18:40.551 --> 00:18:43.670
Republicans could get behind an entire federal health pact.

340
00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:49.340
<v 2>Joe Biden's healthcare plan would spend $750 billion more on Obamacare and</v>

341
00:18:49.341 --> 00:18:50.600
cap drug place. Inflation.

342
00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.170
<v 1>Biden's plan is to offer a public option in healthcare. In this sense,</v>

343
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:57.620
it would go further than what was put in place in Massachusetts by offering to

344
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.210
buy government health insurance,

345
00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.090
the goal for millions of Americans to purchase this public insurance.

346
00:19:02.091 --> 00:19:05.630
Do you have a large enough volume of policy holders to make this public option

347
00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.620
affordable, sustainable and competitive with private insurance?

348
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.650
In addition by them wants to extend to the public Medicare program,

349
00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.370
which guarantees health care for the elderly and disabled from the age of 60,

350
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.570
instead of the current 65 and friends, if both measures are implemented,

351
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.770
the future Biden administration would for better or worse transform American

352
00:19:24.771 --> 00:19:26.780
healthcare, as we know it. And frankly,

353
00:19:26.781 --> 00:19:30.020
it doesn't seem farfetched to think that such a plan could have the support of

354
00:19:30.021 --> 00:19:30.980
many Republicans.

355
00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:36.380
<v 0>This is.</v>

356
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.890
<v 1>The only issue on which Biden is proposing a U-turn on Trump starts.</v>

357
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:45.650
<v 2>Biden's sets out $2 trillion plan for carbon free electricity by 2035.</v>

358
00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:46.190
Let's see.

359
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:50.450
<v 1>Going from zero to a climate plan that invests $2 billion over four years.</v>

360
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.690
I don't know. It's like going from classical music to death metal,

361
00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.650
but I didn't propose is achieving a zero emissions economy by 2050 in order to

362
00:19:57.651 --> 00:19:58.220
do so.

363
00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:01.970
He is committed to electric vehicles promoting clean energy and supporting

364
00:20:01.971 --> 00:20:05.570
research into technologies that capture CO2 from the atmosphere.

365
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.130
But hold on a moment because we've already told you that Biden plays for this

366
00:20:09.131 --> 00:20:13.010
center and here you can see it again perfectly to give you an idea of Obama's

367
00:20:13.011 --> 00:20:16.160
former vice president does not reject nuclear energy or fracking.

368
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:17.300
So I don't know,

369
00:20:17.301 --> 00:20:20.810
is it so crazy to think that he could get the support of the Republicans for a

370
00:20:20.811 --> 00:20:22.100
federal plan in this year?

371
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:26.660
<v 0>Don't.</v>

372
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.000
<v 1>Forget that no one knows what the future holds. Not even.</v>

373
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.020
<v 0>Him, he's going to be your president because some people don't love me. Maybe.</v>

374
00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.930
<v 1>In short extend medical care,</v>

375
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:39.680
provide stimulus to deal with the crisis and establish a national policy towards

376
00:20:39.681 --> 00:20:43.610
the reduction of carbon emissions. This is the Biden plan. In a nutshell,

377
00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.190
you could take or leave those ideas, but they are not radical.

378
00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.860
And if we take into account,

379
00:20:47.861 --> 00:20:50.530
the Democrats eagerness to reach agreements with the opposition,

380
00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.410
the result would probably not be any disruptive change.

381
00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:57.610
Basically what Biden is proposing is simply to bring order to Washington.

382
00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.290
But at this point, it's your turn.

383
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.480
What do you think of Joe Biden's election promises?

384
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:04.480
