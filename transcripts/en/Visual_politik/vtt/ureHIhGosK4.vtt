00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.750
<v 0>Welcome to this new installment in this series of videos about the world of</v>

2
00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:08.160
finance that we're making in collaboration with value school, Hey, by the way,

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.350
their website is now available in English.

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.110
I'll leave the link here in case you want to learn a little bit more about this

5
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:16.020
project value school, but having said that let's get.

6
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.443
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

7
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.820
<v 0>Friends.</v>

8
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.450
I don't think it's too hard for me to convince you that Harley Davidson is the

9
00:00:29.451 --> 00:00:32.420
largest motorcycle manufacturer in the United States.

10
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.350
And one of the most legendary and iconic brands in the American economy.

11
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.243
<v 1>Today.</v>

12
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.670
<v 0>Just in the United States.</v>

13
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.020
According to the popular ranking made by the consultancy firm into brands on

14
00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:49.070
brand valuation,

15
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.880
Harley-Davidson remains one of the 100 most valuable brands in the us.

16
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.163
<v 1>Well.</v>

17
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.710
<v 0>Nick engine noise firing from its pistons and it's iconic place in popular</v>

18
00:01:00.711 --> 00:01:01.130
culture.

19
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.240
Can you imagine Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper in easy rider without their

20
00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:08.630
customized Hollies? How about that scene in born to be wild? Well,

21
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.260
with a Kimco one 25, it just wouldn't have been quite the same

22
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.450
Anyway, who hasn't heard of the King of bike culture.

23
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.690
You don't have to know anything about motorcycles to know what a Holly is.

24
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.240
Although to be fair, if you ask younger people this question,

25
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.810
then the answer may be very different from what we all think you'll soon.

26
00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:27.644
See what I mean?

27
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.120
Despite everything the last six years have been terrifying for Holly Davidson

28
00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:37.340
stakeholders. Over this time, the Milwaukee,

29
00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:42.110
Wisconsin based company has seen its share price plummet by nearly 70%.

30
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.420
We're talking about a company with a straightforward and easy to understand

31
00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:51.140
business. Basically Holly Davidson operates two business areas,

32
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.010
the production and sale of motorcycles and accessories on the one hand,

33
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.540
which accounts for 88% of the company's revenue and the financial division on

34
00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:03.680
the other, that roughly accounts for the remaining 12% of revenue from there,

35
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.130
we can identify its brand has a clear competitive advantage,

36
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.570
and usually its product,

37
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.500
the bikes directed towards customers with higher disposable income,

38
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.110
which in principle represents more strengths.

39
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.550
And as if that weren't enough over the last few years,

40
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.960
this company has quoted a price to profits PP ratio that is

41
00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:28.400
substantially lower than that offered us stock exchange average about 13 times

42
00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:29.234
its profits.

43
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.250
<v 1>That.</v>

44
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.810
<v 0>Is we have an uncomplicated business, a valuable brand, a leadership position,</v>

45
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.780
and they've very reasonable people.

46
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.733
<v 1>Ratio.</v>

47
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.990
<v 0>During these last six years,</v>

48
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.040
this company should have been squarely on the radar of many investors. However,

49
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.260
as we have already mentioned during this time,

50
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.040
the share price has actually collapsed by 70% for many analysts.

51
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.100
This makes it an example of what is known as a valuation.

52
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.160
<v 1>So what is a value trap? Let's say.</v>

53
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.420
<v 0>That in financial slang,</v>

54
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.500
a value trap is a company that seems to trade below its intrinsic value,

55
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.030
but that's, for some reason it is not undervalued, but in fact, the opposite,

56
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.250
therefore becoming a risky investment.

57
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.340
These are usually companies in decline we've structural problems.

58
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.410
<v 1>Well.</v>

59
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.730
<v 0>The fact is that this company,</v>

60
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.230
one of the great icons of made in the USA is currently going through one of the

61
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:26.680
most turbulent and complicated periods in its entire history.

62
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.650
And the obvious question we should ask is what is going on with one of the most

63
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:31.930
legendary companies in American industry?

64
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.770
What could possibly explain its share price, experiencing such a collapse

65
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.060
Once more right now in the face of the enormous difficulties,

66
00:03:42.061 --> 00:03:46.200
it faces a plan has been put in place to restructure the entire company from top

67
00:03:46.201 --> 00:03:49.410
to bottom. What is this plan? Can it succeed in this video?

68
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.680
We will tell you all about what's happening with the most well-known motorcycle

69
00:03:52.681 --> 00:03:55.050
manufacturer in the world. So let's begin.

70
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.920
<v 1>The golden age.</v>

71
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.480
<v 0>Any good success story in the United States.</v>

72
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.140
This one also begins at home though this time, not in a garage.

73
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.320
The first workshop was in the basement of the Davidson family home.

74
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.030
Although soon after the activity was moved to a small shed in the family.

75
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.910
<v 1>It was there.</v>

76
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.260
<v 0>In the early 20th century in 1903, to be exact that Milwaukee engineer,</v>

77
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.130
William Holly and his friend Arthur Davidson designed a motorized bike,

78
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.970
a device whose first engine had a leather belt transmission and a total of three

79
00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:32.880
horsepower. Yes, that's what I said. Three horses.

80
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.053
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

81
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.540
<v 0>You had to put your feet on the ground and push to help the machine move even.</v>

82
00:04:39.541 --> 00:04:41.970
So that's where the great success story began. Gradually.

83
00:04:41.971 --> 00:04:45.660
The company grew and just three years later in 1906, the new company,

84
00:04:45.661 --> 00:04:49.860
and now grated a new workshop of 200 meters square and had six employees.

85
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.130
And from there, well, from there, the takeoff was meteoric

86
00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.090
By 1920 Harley Davidson was already the world's largest motorcycle

87
00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:03.390
manufacturer. Largely thanks to the role it played during the world war one.

88
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.350
Throughout this time,

89
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.430
the Milwaukee company manufactured more than 20,000 motorcycles for the U S

90
00:05:08.431 --> 00:05:09.480
army. Over the years,

91
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.080
military conflicts played a key role in the development of this company during

92
00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:14.400
world war II, for example,

93
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.480
Harley Davidson manufactured nearly 90,000 motorcycles for the U S military.

94
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.860
It could be said that this involvement boosted Harley Davidson's image as a 100%

95
00:05:22.861 --> 00:05:23.310
American.

96
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.143
<v 1>And product.</v>

97
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.170
<v 0>So after the war,</v>

98
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.110
this company not only maintained its strong position in the North American

99
00:05:31.111 --> 00:05:34.740
market, taking more than 50% of all motorbike sales,

100
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.850
it also became an emblem, an unmistakable icon in American culture.

101
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:42.150
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

102
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.260
<v 0>Groups of bikers, war, veterans, and appearances and films such as Terminator,</v>

103
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.230
Robocop, pop fiction, or Rocky among many of us.

104
00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.790
And of course it's had its tough years.

105
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.930
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

106
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.420
<v 0>From European and especially Japanese add Harley Davidson on the ropes in the</v>

107
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:04.010
1980s in 1982, sales fell just to over 28,000 units.

108
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.360
And the worst was expected.

109
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.170
This was something that had already happened to Holly's well-known rival Indian

110
00:06:09.171 --> 00:06:12.950
motors, which ended up filing for bankruptcies on successive occasions.

111
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.300
And passing from hand to hand,

112
00:06:14.301 --> 00:06:18.200
as manufacturing was constantly interrupted by financial problems. However,

113
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.740
president Reagan's decision to set tariffs on Japanese motorcycle imports,

114
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.590
along with a complete restructuring of the company, changed everything.

115
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.480
And so year after year Harley-Davidson has maintained its top position and the

116
00:06:29.481 --> 00:06:31.070
North American market. Of course,

117
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.680
the problems it is now facing are a little different.

118
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.780
<v 1>A cold engine.</v>

119
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.170
<v 0>As we've told you already,</v>

120
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.710
Harley Davidson is going through one of the most complicated periods in its

121
00:06:44.711 --> 00:06:49.120
entire history that their shares have plummeted by 70% in the last six years.

122
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.300
It's no accident. The truth is this old rockstar of the highways.

123
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:53.380
Hasn't really rocketed.

124
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:54.250
<v 1>For many years.</v>

125
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.560
<v 0>You see in this table that while over the last six years virtually all of its</v>

126
00:06:59.561 --> 00:07:03.790
rivals have seen their motorcycle sales grow from one year to the next Holly

127
00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:08.350
Davidson has seen its motorcycle sales reduce at an average rate of 4% per

128
00:07:08.351 --> 00:07:09.970
year, year after year.

129
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:12.190
<v 1>Even if.</v>

130
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.640
<v 0>We take into account the relatively strong revenues in its financial division,</v>

131
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.070
the result is that corporate sales have been losing ground.

132
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.993
<v 1>For years.</v>

133
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.610
<v 0>In fact, in terms of the number of bikes sold sales in 2019,</v>

134
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.280
we're at the lowest levels of the loss.

135
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.513
<v 1>15 Years.</v>

136
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.430
<v 0>This in companies,</v>

137
00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.580
we have so much operational leverage that require a lot of investment in

138
00:07:33.581 --> 00:07:37.720
capital, such as factories, machines, distribution centers, et cetera. Well,

139
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:38.860
it is a problem. And, uh.

140
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.100
<v 1>The serious one, for example.</v>

141
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:46.390
<v 0>The return on invested capital in this company in 2019 was 50% lower than the</v>

142
00:07:46.391 --> 00:07:49.810
averages of the previous five years and less than half of what the company

143
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.550
pertained in 2014,

144
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.370
A similar evolution to that's recorded by its net margin that has dropped from

145
00:07:57.371 --> 00:08:00.040
levels of close to 15% to just over half that.

146
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:04.030
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

147
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.250
<v 0>It swelled. The company has seen its leveraged levels,</v>

148
00:08:06.251 --> 00:08:10.300
skyrocket the combination of more debt and poorer results brought the debt to

149
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.150
EBI TDA ratio to be above seven.

150
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:21.370
And now in 2020, especially after the impact of the coronavirus,

151
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.100
the suggestion is that it could be much, much worse.

152
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.160
What's really going on with Harley Davidson.

153
00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.890
Why on earth are its bikes having such a hard time?

154
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.130
Isn't it still one of the great American brands at the end of the day? Well,

155
00:08:36.131 --> 00:08:41.020
that's exactly what we want to do. You see,

156
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:45.640
according to an analysis published in 2019 by the investment bank UBS,

157
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:49.600
the typical owner of a Holly is a white man married about 50 years old and with

158
00:08:49.601 --> 00:08:52.330
an income of above $90,000 per year,

159
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.820
that is a generational shift is making the younger lose the special attraction

160
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:01.620
for types of motorcycles that are large, heavy and above all very expensive.

161
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:03.420
<v 1>So.</v>

162
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.180
<v 0>What we have is a buyer with an average age of more than 50 years.</v>

163
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.060
And although the company has sought to reach out to a younger audience,

164
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:11.940
the truth is that so far, it has really not succeeded.

165
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.830
And that is certainly not a good idea.

166
00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:18.460
<v 1>As the baby.</v>

167
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.550
<v 0>The boomer generation ages,</v>

168
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.460
it stands to reason that the potential customer base shrinks.

169
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.790
And besides that we have to add in the increasing competition that comes with

170
00:09:25.791 --> 00:09:27.830
this kind of generational change. For example,

171
00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.200
there are the good results obtained by the rival company,

172
00:09:30.201 --> 00:09:34.250
Polaris after relaunching the legendary American brand Indian motorcycle,

173
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.350
a brand that specializes in large motors,

174
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.580
Despite the predictable lows of April and March,

175
00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.880
2020 at the time of making this video for thrice of Harley Davidson shares has

176
00:09:46.881 --> 00:09:51.170
just soared to over 75% from the $15 to

177
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.210
$27 27 cents.

178
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:56.720
And not only that to many analysts have also changed their recommendation on

179
00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:57.950
this company and all this,

180
00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:01.100
all this has a lot to do with a change that occurred in February.

181
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:04.520
<v 1>Oh game changer.</v>

182
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.520
<v 0>After trying many things such as pushing models, focused on a younger audience,</v>

183
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:11.870
boosting loyalty programs,

184
00:10:11.871 --> 00:10:15.470
betting on developing electric models or seeking to reduce costs with factories

185
00:10:15.471 --> 00:10:19.550
in India. Finally in February, 2020, the company's former CEO,

186
00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.350
Matt [inaudible] decided to set up.

187
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:22.723
<v 1>Side.</v>

188
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:25.850
<v 0>Until that point.</v>

189
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.690
Nothing had worked the position of maximum responsibility and the management of

190
00:10:29.691 --> 00:10:33.260
the company then fell into the hands of someone with a completely different

191
00:10:33.261 --> 00:10:34.094
profile.

192
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:36.650
Madeline [inaudible] was an engineer with a long history in the industry.

193
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.500
The new person chosen to take charge of Harley Davidson was Joe.

194
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.450
[inaudible] a marketing specialist,

195
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.880
environmental activists and collector of African. Yeah.

196
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.013
<v 1>Oh.</v>

197
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.631
<v 0>Evidentially.</v>

198
00:10:47.631 --> 00:10:51.050
A very clear example of how the company wants to change from top to bottom and

199
00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:52.850
from left to right. Completely.

200
00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.650
But who exactly is he? Well, to give you an idea,

201
00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.890
we're talking about a marketing specialist who started his career in the

202
00:11:00.891 --> 00:11:05.690
personal care multinational Colgate's Palm leaf and who rapidly Rose to fame

203
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:09.920
and earned his fortune. When at 30, he became the CEO of Puma,

204
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.860
a company that was practically bankrupt at the time, incidentally,

205
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:17.180
he was the youngest CEO of a publicly traded company in the history of Germany

206
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:21.020
before long Zeist managed to straighten things out and change the company's

207
00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.770
image into a fashion brand links to a sporting lifestyle. For example,

208
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.120
they made an agreement with Madonna,

209
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:28.940
the queen of pop to wear their trainers during her tours.

210
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:33.380
When he left the post two decades later, whom his shares had increased 27 fold.

211
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:35.930
<v 1>Well.</v>

212
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:39.290
<v 0>That's exactly what he intends to do with Harley-Davidson to carry out a</v>

213
00:11:39.291 --> 00:11:43.130
complete corporate revolution that puts the iconic American brand back on top.

214
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:47.000
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

215
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.330
<v 0>For example, plans include substantially reducing the number of bike models,</v>

216
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.800
which improves factory productivity and efficiency one hand,

217
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.400
and on the other enables them to focus on the most cost-effective models.

218
00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:01.643
<v 1>He is.</v>

219
00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:06.390
<v 0>Harley Davidson will focus exclusively on the 50 geographic markets where the</v>

220
00:12:06.391 --> 00:12:10.830
company is strongest. That is in locations where the numbers don't work a week.

221
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.083
<v 1>Well, he closed them.</v>

222
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.810
<v 0>The laying off of 13% of the workforce worldwide,</v>

223
00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.650
the suspension of share buyback programs and plans to reduce current expenses

224
00:12:22.651 --> 00:12:24.510
and capital investment have been also.

225
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:29.100
<v 1>So far all this together.</v>

226
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:31.680
<v 0>With a reinforced commitment to electric motorbikes,</v>

227
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.460
and a new approach to marketing is what this CEO hopes we'll be able to turn

228
00:12:35.461 --> 00:12:38.880
around with a difficult situation that this Milwaukee manufacturer is good.

229
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.133
<v 1>Three.</v>

230
00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:42.540
<v 0>Question is,</v>

231
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:46.800
will Holly Davidson succeed or will it continue to destroy its value on its own

232
00:12:46.801 --> 00:12:48.060
race to the abyss?

233
00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:52.110
Can you make the shares of an American icon take off or are they doomed to

234
00:12:52.111 --> 00:12:52.980
remain a value?

235
00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:58.530
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:01.470
