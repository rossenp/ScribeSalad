<v 0>This video is a little different.</v>

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.510
<v 1>This occasion.</v>

3
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.900
We want to answer some of the most important questions facing the world today.

4
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.960
And at the same time, the questions that shock us the most,

5
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.350
why are so many countries issuing debt at negative interest rates?

6
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.440
Why are investors willing to pay money to finance nations?

7
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.770
How do politicians hope to finance the immense public spending plans?

8
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.590
They are approving in response to the coronavirus.

9
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.100
And what if I were to tell you that these two questions are closely related to

10
00:00:28.101 --> 00:00:31.880
the increase in the wealth gap that has been recorded over the last few decades

11
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.110
in developed countries?

12
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.400
Are you ready to get into the ins and the outs of the global economic system?

13
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.600
Well, let's get started.

14
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:45.283
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

15
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.560
<v 1>Coronavirus crisis is a harsh and unavoidable reality for economies and</v>

16
00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:55.730
governments around the world.

17
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.270
Measures taken to tackle the health crisis such as quarantine or business

18
00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:03.200
closures have not only sunk economic activity, but also tax revenues.

19
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.123
At the same time,

20
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.400
governments are putting in place all sorts of stimulus plans to try and get

21
00:01:07.401 --> 00:01:08.270
around the crisis.

22
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.320
I E they are taking public spending do previously unknown levels,

23
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.450
coronavirus Trump signs into law, largest bailout in us history.

24
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.310
BBC Germany announces 130 billion Euro stimulus

25
00:01:22.311 --> 00:01:26.030
package. As unemployment rises in Europe, Euro news,

aims to pay 10 million laid off workers, their full wages,

28
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.930
Asia Nikai review just last month on 21st of July, 2020,

29
00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:43.250
the 27 partners of the European union agreed to approve an emergency plan,

30
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.880
an economic stimulus plan of 750 billion euros,

31
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.350
or just over 850 billion us dollars at current exchange rate.

32
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.273
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.670
<v 1>And that requires the European commission to issue huge amounts of debts to the</v>

34
00:01:58.671 --> 00:02:00.260
market in order to be financed,

35
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.310
that is to say the public debt of minor States will now also be added on a

36
00:02:04.311 --> 00:02:07.070
larger scale to that of the European commission itself.

37
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.460
The recovery fund agreed at the European council,

38
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.310
total 750 billion euros,

39
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.600
a general Marshall plan to provide a strong response to the COVID 19 crisis

40
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.530
focused on the transformations needed to achieve a more resilient green,

41
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.710
digital and inclusive economy. Pedro Sanchez,

42
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.340
president of the government of Spain added to this European community plan.

43
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.720
All the stimulus plans approved by each member country on an individual basis.

44
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.530
We are talking about a combined response of hundreds and hundreds of billions of

45
00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:38.360
euros. Meanwhile, outside of Europe,

46
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.570
other countries throughout the world are doing exactly the same thing.

47
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.490
Now it stands to reason that if,

48
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.840
as a result of the economic crisis unleashed by SARS coronavirus to public

49
00:02:47.841 --> 00:02:52.460
revenues, fall and government spending increases, what do we find? Three, two,

50
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:53.323
one,

51
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.820
Exactly huge public deficits. And that's exactly what's happening.

52
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.230
Let's take a look for example,

53
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.490
at the case of the great North American giant United States started 2020 with a

54
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:10.900
public debt that was already above 105% of GDP. But that fact,

55
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.780
that fact has become outdated faster than Badu Rose boulevards.

56
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.740
After the coronavirus crisis unfolded us Congress to prove to the largest

57
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:21.610
bailout in history, a rescue of more than $2.3 trillion,

58
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.390
the federal government has started burning dollars at full speed to give you an

59
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:28.930
idea, just looking at the period between mid April and mid June, 2020,

60
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.950
the us national debt increased by more than $2 trillion. Yes.

61
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.800
2 trillion with a T in just over two months.

62
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.710
And take note because the forecast is that the federal government will close

63
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:40.540
2020 with a huge public.

64
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.620
That's a fit really hold onto your chair of nearly $4 trillion,

65
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.240
which in terms of GDP accounts for more than 17% of their entire

66
00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:51.700
economy. Yes, yes. You did hear correctly.

67
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.860
We're not talking about Argentina or anything like that.

68
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:57.340
We're talking about the United States. I'll repeat the figure. A public deficit,

69
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.600
more than 17% us federal budget deficit will approach

70
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.550
$4 trillion in 2020 CBO says as the economy continues to

71
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.360
nosedive Forbes, and it could be even worse if things don't get better soon.

72
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.450
And Trump manages to pull off a second term in the upcoming elections,

73
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.080
the president has already indicated that he is willing to burn all his bridges

74
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:17.914
to be reelected

75
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.120
In this way.

76
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.950
The United States will close 2020 with a public debt close to 130% of GDP,

77
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.690
more than $28 trillion for give you an idea that amount is equivalent to twice

78
00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:34.860
the entire Chinese economy,

79
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.340
seven times the German economy or 20 times the Spanish economy.

80
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.380
And that may explain news like this us to hit Japan like levels of government

81
00:04:43.381 --> 00:04:46.740
debt by 2050 budget group says market watch.

82
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.640
And the obvious question is how on earth are governments going to fund this

83
00:04:50.641 --> 00:04:54.660
gigantic torrent of public debt, billions and trillions of dollars,

84
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.490
more and more public debt? Well,

85
00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.570
it's right here where one of the most important institutions in global economic

86
00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:03.060
fabric swings into action central banks.

87
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.570
Do you want an example of the role this type of institution plays today? Well,

88
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.493
look at this.

89
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.243
<v 0>During March.</v>

90
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.320
<v 1>The us treasury department issues, $15.6 billion in uncle Sam's debt bonds.</v>

91
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.320
And the question is, do you know how much debt from the us government,

92
00:05:19.321 --> 00:05:23.250
the fed or the federal reserve bought during the same time? Well, no more,

93
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.690
no less than 15 and a half billion dollars that is during the month of March and

94
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.320
April, the federal reserve purchased the equivalent of all debt issued by the us

95
00:05:31.321 --> 00:05:34.500
government. It didn't do it directly. That's true.

96
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:37.410
These were debt purchases that had already been issued,

97
00:05:37.411 --> 00:05:39.180
but ultimately the result is the same.

98
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.240
The federal reserve creates artificial demand on public debt,

99
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.450
keeping the prices and interest rates of government issued debt bonds low,

100
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.040
as well as ensuring market liquidity.

101
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:50.130
<v 0>Yes.</v>

102
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.940
<v 1>That's right.</v>

103
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.480
The federal reserve is backing the debt issued by the United States government

104
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.430
at very high levels, never seen before.

105
00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.800
And the question many of you are surely asking here is how is the fed paying for

106
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:03.110
the purchase of this huge amount of us government debt?

107
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.080
Well friends. I'm sure if anyone is watching us from Argentina,

108
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.620
they know the process all too well with new money with money created out of

109
00:06:14.621 --> 00:06:16.210
nowhere. Yes, yes.

110
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.600
You heard me perfectly clear the fed just like the other central banks can

111
00:06:19.601 --> 00:06:21.340
create money out of nowhere.

112
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.890
You could say they've gone a bit nuts with the money printer. Of course,

113
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.210
it's actually much easier.

114
00:06:25.211 --> 00:06:28.240
These days just typing a few numbers into the computer to create new money,

115
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.260
new money with which they then make transactions like this. Wait a minute.

116
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.460
So are central banks creating new money to buy public debts as if by magic?

117
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.180
Well, yes, that's exactly what's going on now. What exactly is the strategy?

118
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.520
What consequences can these types of processes have?

119
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.350
How far do their operations go? Well,

120
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.050
these are the topics we'll look at in this video, but first,

121
00:06:47.051 --> 00:06:50.830
first we need to know exactly who they are and how the central banks work.

122
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.843
Let's go.

123
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.720
<v 0>The hearts of the financial system.</v>

124
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.740
<v 1>What exactly is the central bank? Yes.</v>

125
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.310
I know they are usually totally unknown entities to the general public,

126
00:07:06.311 --> 00:07:09.190
but nevertheless, when it comes to the moment of truth,

127
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.920
their involvement in our lives can have huge repercussions.

128
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.930
Central banks are the entities that manage the production and distribution of

129
00:07:16.931 --> 00:07:19.780
money. They control the monetary mass and level of interest rates.

130
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.770
They are the nerve center, the heart of the modern financial system. Of course,

131
00:07:23.771 --> 00:07:27.250
we're talking about a very special type of bank and not just because they don't

132
00:07:27.251 --> 00:07:30.490
interact with the public, their customers are basically commercial banks.

133
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.280
Their main objective is usually to maintain price stability.

134
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.880
And in some cases also support job creation and economic activity.

135
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.810
These institutions have become such important entities for the modern financial

136
00:07:43.811 --> 00:07:46.510
system that every time a crisis situation occurs,

137
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.960
they are often the first line of defense that politicians around the world turn

138
00:07:49.961 --> 00:07:51.760
to. And the question is, for what reason.

139
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:52.803
<v 0>What do they do?</v>

140
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.240
<v 1>You see central banks, traditionally resorted strategies,</v>

141
00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.710
such as changing interest rates,

142
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.160
injecting new money into the economy or supporting banks with liquidity

143
00:08:03.161 --> 00:08:06.850
problems. That's why they're also known as last resort lenders. In fact,

144
00:08:06.851 --> 00:08:08.770
I'm absolutely certain. And I mean,

145
00:08:08.771 --> 00:08:11.380
I'm really sure that everyone absolutely everyone,

146
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.230
no matter which corner of the globe you're watching us from has heard of the

147
00:08:14.231 --> 00:08:18.760
central bank lowering interest rates to stimulate investment and fast push the

148
00:08:18.761 --> 00:08:19.594
economy forward.

149
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.910
It stands to reason that when companies can finance themselves at lower interest

150
00:08:27.911 --> 00:08:29.380
rates, they tend to invest more,

151
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.980
which in turn generates more economic activity and more jobs. Of course,

152
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:33.850
as we will see,

153
00:08:33.851 --> 00:08:37.840
this has many other implications because the interest rate in practice is

154
00:08:37.841 --> 00:08:39.370
reduced by injecting new money,

155
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.160
which in turn can erode the value of existing money.

156
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.820
That is it can create inflation and many other economic problems.

157
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.020
Despite the downsides,

158
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:54.160
the fact is that lowering interest rates was the basic strategy you use right up

159
00:08:54.161 --> 00:08:58.590
until the last major, the 2008 financial crisis at that time,

160
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.070
the central banks in virtually every developed country on the planet lowered

161
00:09:02.071 --> 00:09:02.904
interest rates.

162
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:10.130
<v 0>For example.</v>

163
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.130
<v 1>Well, this chart shows what the federal reserve did at that time,</v>

164
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.850
which is something very similar to what the central bank of Japan wants to do.

165
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.900
The question is what happens when the rates are already incredibly low at

166
00:09:29.901 --> 00:09:32.990
levels, close to zero? What can central banks do in that situation?

167
00:09:32.991 --> 00:09:34.970
Careful here, it's not just any old question.

168
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.930
Everything that is happening today related to bailouts and economic policy

169
00:09:38.931 --> 00:09:41.810
hinges on this question, but, okay. I'll explain. For example,

170
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.410
when the coronavirus crisis broke out, central banks did the first thing,

171
00:09:45.411 --> 00:09:47.630
they always do lower interest rates,

172
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:52.580
but of course lowering them from 0.5 to 0%. Doesn't make much of a change.

173
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:56.270
It's not like when they were reduced from 6% to 3%, for example,

174
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:59.450
therefore the effectiveness of this action is much more limited.

175
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.910
Of course, that doesn't mean that they're going to stand around,

176
00:10:04.911 --> 00:10:06.680
scratching their noses. Not at all.

177
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.380
This problem was already brought into focus from 2008.

178
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.340
And that's when the central banks introduced the so-called unconventional

179
00:10:13.341 --> 00:10:17.360
monetary policy also known in pompous technocratic language as quantitative

180
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.270
easing. And what are these kinds of political strategies? Well,

181
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.450
basically get the machine printing, paper money over and over again,

182
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:27.470
which in modern terms means taking a keyboard and starting to compulsively press

183
00:10:27.471 --> 00:10:29.900
the number keys to create more and more new money.

184
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.420
And as we usually say around here, no sooner said than done.

185
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.430
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

186
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:38.270
<v 1>Look for example,</v>

187
00:10:38.271 --> 00:10:41.960
at how the federal reserve increased the amount of money in circulation from

188
00:10:41.961 --> 00:10:43.460
2008 onwards.

189
00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.820
And the question that we all need to ask is what on earth are they doing with

190
00:10:46.821 --> 00:10:47.900
all this new money? Well,

191
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:51.860
basically launching it on the market to buy all kinds of assets, mortgages,

192
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.950
bank bonds, and mainly outstanding government debts. That is,

193
00:10:54.951 --> 00:10:56.060
as we have already said,

194
00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:59.150
they buy it from other investors and not from the governments themselves,

195
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.480
because officially, unless you were a country such as Venezuela,

196
00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.970
it is forbidden to monetize bit. In other words,

197
00:11:04.971 --> 00:11:08.720
central banks cannot directly finance governance. Although in practice,

198
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.250
what they do is very similar

199
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:15.380
In any case.

200
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.100
The idea with this quantitative easing is to flood liquidity markets,

201
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.910
create artificial demand and thus reduce financing costs for governments, banks,

202
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:27.500
and businesses. For example, in just over six years, between 2008 and 2015,

203
00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:32.000
the Fed's balance sheet increased almost five fold from $1 trillion to more than

204
00:11:32.001 --> 00:11:34.970
4.5 trillion. So in just over six years,

205
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.930
the fed created more than 3 trillion new dollars to intervene in financial

206
00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:42.680
markets and adulterate financing costs, especially the cost of financing,

207
00:11:42.681 --> 00:11:46.190
the U S government. And it wasn't just something that the United States did,

208
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:47.510
the European central bank,

209
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.660
the central bank of Japan and the bank of England among many others,

210
00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.553
they did the same.

211
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.490
<v 0>But.</v>

212
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.080
<v 1>That, that was nothing compared to the response.</v>

213
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:59.560
They've now given to the coronavirus crisis. Friends. You may not know that,

214
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:03.760
but in 2020, we are witnessing a historic financial experiment,

215
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.960
the greatest quantitative expansion in history and take notes because this

216
00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:11.830
experiment is not without risks. You want to know what we're up against? Well,

217
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:12.723
listen up.

218
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.000
<v 0>Corona.</v>

219
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.700
<v 1>Recession, the heavy cavalry arrives.</v>

220
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:22.380
<v 0>Friends.</v>

221
00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:26.040
<v 1>This time the central banks have decided to jump in head first. Yes,</v>

222
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:29.880
as we have seen, they already played a decisive role in the previous crisis.

223
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:33.960
Now in 2020, they have decided to move to the next level, look closely.

224
00:12:33.961 --> 00:12:36.630
For example, at the, how the federal reserve has reacted.

225
00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:40.440
<v 0>Take notes.</v>

226
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.360
<v 1>Just in the four months from March to June,</v>

227
00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:46.740
the fed has created money and expanded this balance by nearly $3 trillion for

228
00:12:46.741 --> 00:12:47.574
you to get an idea.

229
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:51.960
This is more than the size of the entire economy of India did United Kingdom or

230
00:12:51.961 --> 00:12:55.590
France. It is such a large amount of money that hypothetically speaking,

231
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:59.550
the federal reserve could have bought almost all the companies listed on the

232
00:12:59.551 --> 00:13:01.560
London and Milan stock exchanges.

233
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.620
Or if you like all companies listed on the exchanges of Germany,

234
00:13:04.621 --> 00:13:05.640
Spain and Brazil.

235
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.153
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

236
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.980
<v 1>And then the key question comes back again,</v>

237
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.130
what exactly are they doing with such vast quantities of money? Well,

238
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.040
Boeing everything, federal government debts debt from States,

239
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.830
municipalities banks, mortgages, and even corporate debt from large private.

240
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.193
<v 0>Companies.</v>

241
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.380
<v 1>And it's not just about the federal reserve.</v>

242
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:31.830
If you take into account the federal banks of the U S Europe, Canada,

243
00:13:31.831 --> 00:13:35.340
and the UK, Japan and Australia, the forecast is that together,

244
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:39.150
they expect to increase their balance sheets by a minimum of more than $9

245
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.440
trillion by the end of 2020.

246
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.230
And if things don't get better by the time that stimulus runs out,

247
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.130
we could be talking about a lot.

248
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:46.463
<v 0>More money.</v>

249
00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.140
<v 1>We have it.</v>

250
00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.530
That's exactly how politicians around the world hope to find their gigantic

251
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.480
economic stimulus and rescue programs.

252
00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:58.170
They are basically relying on central banks to create enough new money to

253
00:13:58.171 --> 00:14:00.960
artificially stimulate demand for the debt they've created,

254
00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:04.470
that will allow them to finance all their huge public spending plans.

255
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.300
For example, by the end of 2020,

256
00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:11.100
the European central bank is expected to own more than 30% of all public

257
00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:15.630
debt issued by all Eurozone countries, more than 30%. In other words,

258
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:19.530
the main creditor of Eurozone member countries will be the European central bank

259
00:14:19.531 --> 00:14:20.940
itself. So in other words,

260
00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:24.240
central banks have become the tool that makes all public spending increases

261
00:14:24.241 --> 00:14:27.510
possible. But wait a minute, hold on, stop. We create new money and that's it.

262
00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:29.100
Is it that easy? Well, obviously not.

263
00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:32.910
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

264
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.340
<v 1>Printing more and more money has consequences.</v>

265
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.670
Those of you who are watching us from countries like Argentina or Venezuela,

266
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:40.140
know this all too well,

267
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.620
these kinds of policies eroded the value of money and cause problems such as

268
00:14:43.621 --> 00:14:48.090
inflation, financial instability, and bubbles of all kinds, even worse.

269
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.190
Your government is unlikely to tell you this,

270
00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.770
but they could also greater inequality, but here, some of you may be thinking,

271
00:14:54.771 --> 00:14:59.120
but Josh inflation, come on. Why if we're at minimum levels? Well,

272
00:14:59.121 --> 00:15:01.940
yes and no. It depends on how you look at it. For example,

273
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.870
over the past few decades, major technological innovations and globalization,

274
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:10.010
we have the entry of countries such as China into global markets have led to a

275
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:14.030
great increase in productivity and efficiency with that prices could have

276
00:15:14.031 --> 00:15:16.310
collapsed and yet they haven't have they. In other words,

277
00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.360
there has been inflation camouflaged by the effect of improvements in produce.

278
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:24.280
<v 0>No.</v>

279
00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.190
<v 1>Would be that what happens if we compare the evolution of house prices,</v>

280
00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.970
the evolution of stock exchanges and other assets, we have respect to wages.

281
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.780
In all cases,

282
00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:35.530
they have greatly increased at a rate much higher than wage increases.

283
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:38.980
And that coupled with the increasing difficulty in accessing housing,

284
00:15:38.981 --> 00:15:43.120
for example explains why inequality between the richest and the poorest is

285
00:15:43.121 --> 00:15:45.850
growing in developed countries. Yes, that's right.

286
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.480
Monetary policy has a lot to do with the growing wealth gap in developed

287
00:15:49.481 --> 00:15:52.150
countries over the past two decades. And as you will see,

288
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:54.160
along with this effect of inflation on assets,

289
00:15:54.161 --> 00:15:56.980
that obviously benefited those with the most net worth.

290
00:15:56.981 --> 00:16:00.040
There is also another phenomenon known as the Canty on effect.

291
00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:03.940
<v 0>You see.</v>

292
00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:04.661
<v 1>It could be confusing,</v>

293
00:16:04.661 --> 00:16:08.650
but creating new money fundamentally favors the first ones to receive it.

294
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.800
That is the first to finance themselves of this new money created out of

295
00:16:11.801 --> 00:16:15.040
nowhere. The first to be watered with the money of the central bank. Why?

296
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.700
Because they are the first to be able to trade with the new money before it has

297
00:16:18.701 --> 00:16:19.900
an impact on prices,

298
00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.800
whether in consumer goods or investment goods and who were the first to access

299
00:16:23.801 --> 00:16:27.010
these resources, well, governments, banks, and large companies.

300
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:30.490
And this is also why governments are getting bigger and making a life for small

301
00:16:30.491 --> 00:16:33.280
and medium sized enterprises, increasingly difficult.

302
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:39.160
What's more when the European central bank or the federal reserve buys debt

303
00:16:39.161 --> 00:16:42.760
bonds from companies such as not Telefonica or telecom Italia,

304
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:46.120
they get them to be financed at ridiculously reduced rates,

305
00:16:46.121 --> 00:16:48.010
despite being heavily indebted.

306
00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.090
What they do is favor them over smaller companies that have to pay much more for

307
00:16:52.091 --> 00:16:52.924
their finance.

308
00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:57.250
If we combine these three effects,

309
00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.940
the result is that these kinds of monetary policies not only carry the risk of

310
00:17:00.941 --> 00:17:03.250
creating new bubbles and fueling public spending,

311
00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:07.540
but they also increase inequality between the richest and the poorest surprise

312
00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:12.160
friends. The coronavirus crisis is screaming out for strong action, but aren't,

313
00:17:12.161 --> 00:17:14.950
we trusting the capacity of central banks, a little too much,

314
00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:18.730
all the incentives of decision makers or politicians in our best interests,

315
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.940
or are they looking more at the short term to the next election?

316
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.480
Are we really prepared to face the consequences of all these policies?

317
00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.250
Aren't we in danger of Japaneses,

318
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.960
our economies becoming addicted to debt hypertrophy in our States and damaging

319
00:17:31.961 --> 00:17:34.570
the value of our currencies at visual politic,

320
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.300
we will be paying close attention to how events take place.

321
00:17:37.301 --> 00:17:40.570
