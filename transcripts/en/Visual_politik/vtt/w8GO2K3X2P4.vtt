00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.830
<v 1>You don't have to be a genius to know that the SARS coronavirus two pandemic is</v>

2
00:00:15.831 --> 00:00:18.290
wreaking havoc on the economy worldwide. However,

3
00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:21.800
if there's one sector that is really taking a hit, it is the tourism sector.

4
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.410
Suddenly this activity, which was fundamental,

5
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.860
essential key in the economy of many countries, as our example,

6
00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.350
Spain has practically stopped in its tracks,

7
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.640
taking millions and millions of jobs with it, many, many hotels, restaurants,

8
00:00:34.641 --> 00:00:35.690
bars, cafes,

9
00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:39.140
and a long list of businesses of all kinds have been forced to pull down their

10
00:00:39.141 --> 00:00:41.270
blinds and closed their doors and friends.

11
00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:44.600
Keep in mind that the impact is not only touching small businesses.

12
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.030
There are also large groups that are also suffering.

13
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.750
We only have to look at the giants of the air transport sector giants that are

14
00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:53.180
very much affected by the drawing up of tourism,

15
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.130
but also by the collapse of business trends.

16
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:00.440
<v 0>Yes.</v>

17
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.000
<v 1>It's true that the air transport sector accounts for barely 0.3% of the value</v>

18
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:07.880
added to services in the ECB countries,

19
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.410
it is nevertheless a fundamental activity that supports millions of people and

20
00:01:12.411 --> 00:01:16.370
thousands and thousands of companies whose activity depends on people being able

21
00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:17.420
to move around the world.

22
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.860
And of course it could be a good gauge for measuring the trend of international

23
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.750
economic activity. But in the end,

24
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:29.690
it's pretty clear if the restrictions imposed to deal with the pandemic,

25
00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:30.800
don't allow you to travel.

26
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.730
Or if they turn the experience of traveling into a nightmare of restrictions and

27
00:01:34.731 --> 00:01:35.510
impediments,

28
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.930
who on earth is going to fill the planes that were once full of tourists

29
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.330
professionals and people looking to do business.

30
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.870
So how is the sector really doing what exactly has been the impact of the

31
00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:45.704
coronavirus.

32
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.880
<v 0>Friends? Yeah.</v>

33
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.570
<v 1>As you can imagine,</v>

34
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.350
as the months go by and the situation of the crisis and restrictions continues

35
00:01:54.351 --> 00:01:58.130
to be extended, the aviation sector is having an increasingly worse time.

36
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.300
<v 0>Coronavirus airline set for worst year on record.</v>

37
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.741
<v 1>In this video,</v>

38
00:02:03.741 --> 00:02:06.920
we're going to give you some important details about how various companies are

39
00:02:06.921 --> 00:02:10.190
dealing with this situation. And we will not only take a look at the airlines,

40
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.680
but also at the major aircraft manufacturers,

41
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.910
Boeing and Airbus manufacturers who obviously depend on the airline companies

42
00:02:16.911 --> 00:02:20.900
doing well after all, remember that without passengers, there are no flights,

43
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.780
the flights, there are no planes and without the need for planes,

44
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.350
there'll be no new planes sold. Then again, does this reasoning hold up,

45
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.243
let's take a look.

46
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.780
<v 0>The crisis in figures.</v>

47
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.360
<v 1>Pay attention to these figures because what we are going to tell you is the true</v>

48
00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:44.810
picture of what is probably already the biggest crisis we have seen and

49
00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:48.110
something that we may never see again in the air transport sector,

50
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.710
a crisis that makes the one that occurred in the wake of the nine 11 attacks

51
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.780
look like a walk in the park. Take, for example,

52
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.900
this graph that reflects the number of flights tracked by the flight radar,

53
00:02:56.901 --> 00:02:59.710
24 websites in 2019 and 20,

54
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.200
as you can see between March and April, 2020,

55
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:05.770
the number of air operations slumps to around a quarter of those registered in

56
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:09.880
2019. And during the rest of 2020, barely half of that loss has been recovered.

57
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.450
All of this obviously translates into multimillion dollar losses,

58
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.350
firstly for the airlines and also potentially for the aircraft manufacturers.

59
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.160
And of course,

60
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.190
for all those sectors that depend directly on this activity from the Aero

61
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.520
nautical Caitlin companies to the ubiquitous duty free stores,

62
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.110
but let's just focus on the airlines.

63
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.963
<v 0>For now.</v>

64
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.480
<v 1>The recent market analysis by the ITA,</v>

65
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.440
the international air transport association has tried to calculate the impact of

66
00:03:37.441 --> 00:03:41.880
the pandemic. Total industry revenues are expected to fall by 46% in 2020,

67
00:03:41.881 --> 00:03:45.060
compared to those of 2019 airlines faced the loss of

68
00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:48.270
$314 billion in ticket sales revenue.

69
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.110
Putting half of the world's airlines at serious risk of bankruptcy airlines have

70
00:03:52.111 --> 00:03:55.950
reduced their set supply by an average of 70% since January,

71
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.670
2020 and have burned through more than $10 billion a month in uncovered costs

72
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.060
such as aircraft leasing, maintenance, payroll fees,

73
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.810
and a host of other fixed costs that whether the planes fly or not have to be

74
00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:10.920
dealt with, And by 2021,

75
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.130
the situation is not expected to be particularly buoyant either.

76
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.600
The forecast is for airlines to burn through a total between $5 billion and

77
00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:22.290
$6 billion a month in cash. And that helps to explain what we see in this.

78
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.770
See,

79
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.490
there's a huge Gulf that only promises to become even greater considering that

80
00:04:32.491 --> 00:04:34.980
2020 is not yet finished. Traditionally,

81
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.350
the second half is the most profitable for airlines,

82
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.470
but that is unlikely to be the case in the midst of new restrictions,

83
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.740
but friends, the impact is not only to be felt in the loss of trips.

84
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.490
The huge drop in demand for flights is compounded by the extra costs that the

85
00:04:47.491 --> 00:04:51.630
pandemic travel brings and which may remain a heavy burden for a long time.

86
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.261
For example,

87
00:04:52.261 --> 00:04:56.610
airlines now have to invest much more in cleaning sanitizing and disinfecting

88
00:04:56.611 --> 00:05:00.210
planes, which also means spending more time on the ground and less than the air

89
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.240
passengers also have to spend more time on the ground because of increased

90
00:05:03.241 --> 00:05:04.500
controls at airports,

91
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.950
which means the air connections between flights are no longer as short as they

92
00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:09.210
once were without a doubt.

93
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.550
This poses a challenge for flight scheduling and you know,

94
00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:14.130
how it goes any plane on the ground costs money,

95
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.810
But that's not all flood crews now also have to be provided with self filtering

96
00:05:21.811 --> 00:05:25.260
masks and in many cases, goggles and even complete PPE,

97
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.460
almost like healthcare workers equipment that is currently in use on many Asian

98
00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:32.880
airlines, such as air Asia, Korean air, and most Chinese companies.

99
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.360
All of these factors are just some of the many that have led companies around

100
00:05:39.361 --> 00:05:42.990
the world to end up on the brink of bankruptcy or even to declare bankruptcy

101
00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:44.310
already. Unfortunately,

102
00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:48.360
the damage that the Corona virus is doing to the aviation industry could be in

103
00:05:48.361 --> 00:05:50.970
many ways, it repairable for a certain period of time,

104
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.500
perhaps several years years during which the trend for low cost flights or at

105
00:05:55.501 --> 00:05:59.240
least low cost in the sense we've known them could be greatly effected. Now,

106
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.990
will it get to that point? What effects is this crisis having on the airlines?

107
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.410
What role are the governments playing in all this? Well, let's take a look.

108
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.600
<v 0>Airlines on the break.</v>

109
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.490
<v 1>Only two thirds of the world's 26,000 passenger aircraft grounded and some 25</v>

110
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.870
million jobs at risk airlines have faced a major dilemma this 2020 find ways to

111
00:06:25.871 --> 00:06:26.704
avoid closure,

112
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.010
even if it means resorting to bankruptcy or public Baylor mechanisms,

113
00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.050
mechanisms that work better or worse,

114
00:06:32.051 --> 00:06:34.900
depending on the country and the particular region we are talking about.

115
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:35.621
For example,

116
00:06:35.621 --> 00:06:39.220
if we look at the evolution of airlines in the first months of 2020 and what

117
00:06:39.221 --> 00:06:42.430
their financial risk is, we see a pattern that benefits East Asia,

118
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.100
but it's particularly damaging for Africa and Latin them.

119
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.323
<v 0>Erica.</v>

120
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.350
<v 1>In Latin America, many airlines have already begun filing for bankruptcy,</v>

121
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.860
such as AVN cause operations in the United States air in Mexico,

122
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.730
let's ham and team. While in Africa airlines such as South African airways,

123
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.950
which already had problems before the Corona virus,

124
00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.950
ambitious and common air are in a similar situation.

125
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.310
And although bankruptcy does not necessarily imply the disappearance of the

126
00:07:09.311 --> 00:07:13.060
company, the truth is that the issue is usually resolved in two ways,

127
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.630
either with the liquidation of the assets and the end of the brand or with the

128
00:07:16.631 --> 00:07:20.590
financial restructuring of the debt delivery of a state aid package and if

129
00:07:20.591 --> 00:07:23.980
necessary the replacement or dilution of the former shareholders.

130
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.740
And it is possible that it is precisely the situation that will generate

131
00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:32.710
differences between some regions of the world in the near future.

132
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.760
Because it's clear that this drain from economic losses leaves few airlines that

133
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.060
will be able to weather the storm on their own without state aid in the form of

134
00:07:40.061 --> 00:07:43.810
subsidies investments or loans, or at least that's what the politicians say.

135
00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:44.853
You know,

136
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.030
Although it is true that the risk of messy bankruptcy proceedings could be

137
00:07:52.031 --> 00:07:52.864
great.

138
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.250
<v 2>The governments have done a good job in financially supporting aviation jobs</v>

139
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.220
where this has not happened in Latin America. For example,

140
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.730
we see bankruptcies airlines continue to burn through cash,

141
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.420
and that is expected to persist into next year without a second traunch of

142
00:08:07.421 --> 00:08:10.450
financial aid. Many airlines will not make it through the winter.

143
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:14.290
Alexandra at the uni ACC director general of the international air transport

144
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.153
association.

145
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.260
<v 1>Not only does this risk that once again,</v>

146
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.590
we taxpayers will end up paying the price for our politicians decisions,

147
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:25.000
but it also risks falling back into the catastrophic renationalisation policies

148
00:08:25.001 --> 00:08:28.810
of many airlines, of course, apart from that potential risk airlines,

149
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.350
as you can imagine, support public rescues at all costs,

150
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.530
According to them in this case,

151
00:08:38.531 --> 00:08:41.800
it is not that a company is performing badly and is going bankrupt,

152
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:43.900
but that the health measures imposed by governments,

153
00:08:43.901 --> 00:08:47.170
such as confinements quarantines, curfews, hotel closures,

154
00:08:47.171 --> 00:08:50.860
and other measures taken to combat the pandemic directly attack the business of

155
00:08:50.861 --> 00:08:55.560
the airlines, which above all depends on transporting tourists and people.

156
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.071
In other words,

157
00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:59.580
it is not that one or another company is sinking due to bad management,

158
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.940
but rather than this very special situation, that few companies in the sector,

159
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.390
however much cash and savings they have will be able to bear on their own for

160
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:07.110
the airlines.

161
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:11.040
It has meant putting a hold on their source of income while expenses continue to

162
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:11.874
run high.

163
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.090
But let's say that to be more or less than supportive public bailouts depend on

164
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:18.870
each airline.

165
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:23.610
And I suppose also on how that support materializes nonrefundable aid is

166
00:09:23.611 --> 00:09:26.220
not the same as loans with preferential conditions.

167
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.890
The fact is that in the first six months of 2020 alone,

168
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.910
the world's airlines have received $162 billion in state aid,

169
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.660
a huge amount of money of which they have already consumed around 80%.

170
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.340
And of course, if we consider the air,

171
00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:42.870
traffic is not expected to return to 2019 levels until at least 2020 for more

172
00:09:42.871 --> 00:09:44.580
money will be needed, much more money.

173
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.290
But the question is, what else is being done besides transferring public money?

174
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:52.640
Well, check this out.

175
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:57.290
<v 2>Cathay Pacific is regional carrier and 8,500 jobs,</v>

176
00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.180
BBC Korean air to buy Asiana emerges as world's 10th

177
00:10:02.181 --> 00:10:04.460
largest airline Yonhap news agency.

178
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:09.740
China's top airline returns to profit as domestic routes, bloom Nikkei Asia.

179
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.540
<v 1>I stopped to think about it for a moment.</v>

180
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:15.170
These three new stories may represent the living image of what the aviation

181
00:10:15.171 --> 00:10:17.600
market is going to be like over the next few years.

182
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:19.760
It's a market that faces several challenges,

183
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:22.220
cuts in flight frequencies and less supply,

184
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.370
which will mean less employment in the sector, elimination of subsidiaries,

185
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.940
especially those in the low cost market re centralization of the parent

186
00:10:28.941 --> 00:10:32.360
companies, mergers of companies to create larger and stronger entities,

187
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:35.600
which will greatly reduce competition and the war for low prices.

188
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.390
And finally a turn towards the Chinese market,

189
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:42.350
especially for aircraft manufacturers in this last point above all that may

190
00:10:42.351 --> 00:10:44.330
prove key to the future of Boeing and Airbus.

191
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.280
The two main aircraft manufacturers,

192
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:50.390
which have seen their orders for a new aircraft cancellations multiply in recent

193
00:10:50.391 --> 00:10:50.780
months,

194
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:54.860
it's Boeing and Airbus that are the next link in this chain of crisis in a

195
00:10:54.861 --> 00:10:55.850
faltering market.

196
00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:00.050
So what does the future hold for the world's two leading aircraft manufacturers?

197
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.130
Well, let's take a look.

198
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.400
<v 0>Please buy my planes.</v>

199
00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.170
<v 1>If there's one thing that Boeing would have wanted to avoid at all costs,</v>

200
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.270
it is precisely a global pandemic.

201
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.850
Those of you who have been following visual politics for some time now,

202
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.841
we'll know in detail,

203
00:11:20.841 --> 00:11:25.160
what has happened to Boeing in recent years due to the disaster of its seven 37

204
00:11:25.161 --> 00:11:27.380
max model, the defects in the seven, eight, seven,

205
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:31.220
and the delay in the launch of the triple seven X and the crisis that all this

206
00:11:31.221 --> 00:11:33.920
has generated for the company. Well, on top of that crisis,

207
00:11:33.921 --> 00:11:38.330
we must now add that of the SARS cov to a crisis that given the uncertainty of

208
00:11:38.331 --> 00:11:41.120
its flagship model translates into news like this.

209
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:45.170
<v 2>Boeing suffers second consecutive month with no airline orders,</v>

210
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.100
the associated press.

211
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:50.870
<v 1>Something that by the way, had not happened since 1962. And as you can imagine,</v>

212
00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.760
not selling anything for two months as a,

213
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.280
for any company let alone for one like Boeing that was already seriously

214
00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.410
affected by damage done in 2019.

215
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:04.620
<v 0>Look.</v>

216
00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.360
<v 1>To the third quarter of 2020,</v>

217
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:10.650
Boeing has lost more than $3.5 billion while in 2019,

218
00:12:10.651 --> 00:12:13.110
it earned $444 million,

219
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:17.880
which was already a long way from the 8.35 billion earned in profits from the

220
00:12:17.881 --> 00:12:22.650
same time period in 2018, all of those losses accumulated in 2020,

221
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:26.580
nearly 3 billion occurred in the fateful second quarter when the most severe

222
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.640
period of the global confinement was being experienced. In addition,

223
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:33.030
the difficult situation faced by airlines has resulted in cancellation of

224
00:12:33.031 --> 00:12:34.950
aircraft orders. Boeing, for example,

225
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:39.960
already has a net loss of 1020 orders and had only sold 67 aircraft

226
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:42.180
up to the October, 2020. What's more,

227
00:12:42.181 --> 00:12:46.980
it has only delivered 111 aircraft in that period compared to the 321

228
00:12:46.981 --> 00:12:48.630
last year for the same timeframe,

229
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:52.201
These results.

230
00:12:52.201 --> 00:12:56.040
It is not surprising that Boeing is going to lay off more than 30,000 workers

231
00:12:56.041 --> 00:13:00.810
worldwide, which will mean getting rid of 18.7% of its entire workforce.

232
00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.390
Yes, it's true that in the medium and longterm,

233
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.430
everything will return back to normal. In fact,

234
00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.030
the recovery of the aviation sector in a year's time may see an increase in

235
00:13:09.031 --> 00:13:10.710
orders because at the end of the day,

236
00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.440
planes need to be renewed sooner rather than later.

237
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:16.260
But the pitcher in the short term is not so rosy

238
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.000
At Airbus, you got a hand,

239
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.940
things seem to be going a little better and they will come out of the crisis in

240
00:13:23.941 --> 00:13:26.070
a slightly stronger position. Although of course,

241
00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.840
this doesn't mean that it isn't effecting them,

242
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:31.470
but having been the go-to manufacturer for airlines that wanted medium range

243
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.570
aircraft after the Boeing seven 37,

244
00:13:33.571 --> 00:13:36.600
max fiasco has also given them some orders and deliveries

245
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.670
Between January and October. Airbus has delivered 413 aircraft. Yes,

246
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:49.080
413 compared to 111 from Boeing. It's not bad, don't you think?

247
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:53.970
But even so that's 234 less than the number delivered between January

248
00:13:53.971 --> 00:13:55.470
and October, 2019.

249
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:59.670
And Airbus has also had to cut jobs it as announced 15,000 layoffs,

250
00:13:59.671 --> 00:14:02.130
worldwide equating to 11% of its work.

251
00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.053
<v 0>Of course.</v>

252
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.820
<v 1>So you see the aviation crisis is here and everything points to it.</v>

253
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.910
Being here to stay at least for a while, in any case,

254
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.300
it is almost certain that the aircraft manufacturers will recover better than

255
00:14:15.301 --> 00:14:18.540
the airlines, particularly because there are countries like China,

256
00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:22.350
where the demand for airplanes has not only not fallen, but continues to grow.

257
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.173
<v 0>The Asian.</v>

258
00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.170
<v 1>We'll buy 8,600 new planes by 2039 worth about</v>

259
00:14:31.171 --> 00:14:33.330
1.4 trillion. Yes,

260
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.840
that's with a T if Boeing soon overcomes the effects of the grounding of the

261
00:14:36.841 --> 00:14:38.250
seven 37 maxes,

262
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:42.780
which it seems we will soon see flying again and Airbus manages to save star

263
00:14:42.781 --> 00:14:44.520
programs like the 82 20,

264
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.970
the near future for both manufacturers may not be so bad after all,

265
00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:51.290
but that is if you're looking particularly at Asia, however,

266
00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:53.300
in the airline industry, there is a long way to go.

267
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.060
The big debts they are facing in order to maintain their fleets,

268
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.600
jobs and face fixed costs will drag them down for many years.

269
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:03.410
If we also add to this, the mergers and takeovers, that undermined competition,

270
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.020
which is unavoidable in the short and medium term,

271
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.420
the things get even worse for the passengers.

272
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.990
The only hope for airlines today is to fight back by raising prices and reducing

273
00:15:11.991 --> 00:15:13.280
costs. For example,

274
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:16.670
by eliminating free passenger services and making travelers pay all that.

275
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.790
Of course, if they manage to get some government help, but at this point,

276
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:20.780
we want to hear from you.

277
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:24.260
Do you think that the coronavirus will change the world of aviation for river or

278
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:25.970
where we go back to traveling as before,

279
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.300
could this pandemic push Airbus into the role of the world's leading aircraft

280
00:15:29.301 --> 00:15:31.400
manufacturer, if your answers in the comments.
