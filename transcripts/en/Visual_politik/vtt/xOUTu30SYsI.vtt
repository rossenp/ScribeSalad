<v 0>This video is made possible by Blinkist.</v>

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.040
<v 1>And it's to read all the books you want to get all the knowledge you need. Well,</v>

3
00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:09.500
probably not. Right. Everyone is busier than ever.

4
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.200
It's harder than ever to spend time learning. And even when you try it,

5
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.770
there are so many distractions like that tempting video about some nonsense over

6
00:00:15.771 --> 00:00:18.560
there on the rights, or maybe it's the opposite right now,

7
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.410
you're stuck at home due to the Corona virus and the thought of going to a

8
00:00:21.411 --> 00:00:24.080
library or browsing a bookshop seems a bit too risky.

9
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.960
Or you might think that you don't have enough time to read. Well, good news.

10
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.480
Even if you don't, you do, if you use Blinkist,

11
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.990
Blinkist is an app that takes the best insights and need to know info from

12
00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:37.040
thousands of nonfiction books and condenses them into 15 minutes salaries,

13
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.630
which you can read or listen to. They have a huge library and 14 million users,

14
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.470
14 million the team at visual politic, our ideal Blinkist customers.

15
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.430
We find we can actually fit reading a book through Blinkist into a break time or

16
00:00:49.431 --> 00:00:52.880
a commute to a shoot whilst still keeping up with a pretty crazy work schedule.

17
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.420
They've got tons of popular titles, like thinking fast and slow from Daniel.

18
00:00:56.421 --> 00:00:58.580
Conaman also tons of political books.

19
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.590
And if you want to take a look back at the history,

20
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.870
they've got great condensed versions of books,

21
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.060
like the silk roads by Peter Frank Japan,

22
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.630

to reading the seven day trial it's completely free.

27
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.030
And you can cancel at any time during that trial,

28
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.100
if you're not completely into it, but I'm sure. Yeah.

29
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.053
<v 0>You will be.</v>

30
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.470
<v 1>Scene 79 was a difficult year in that year.</v>

31
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.070
Iran's Islamic revolution and the seizure of the United States embassy

32
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.850
interferon took place in Afghanistan after a series of assassinations,

33
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.600
including that of the United States ambassador himself and accrue to tar.

34
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.200
The Soviet union began its armed intervention by deploying thousands and

35
00:01:57.201 --> 00:02:01.310
thousands of men. Thanks. And all kinds of military equipment do Afghan soil.

36
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.400
Also in 1979, Saddam Hussein came to power.

37
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.090
There was the occupation of a great Moscow Mecca that put the Saudi Arabian

38
00:02:08.091 --> 00:02:09.830
Royal family up against the ropes.

39
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.340
And to top it off the signing of the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt

40
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.360
serves to infuriate the Arab world. And as if all that weren't enough,

41
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.290
Iran's Islamic revolution caused oil production in Iran at the time,

42
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.790
one of the world's largest crude oil producers to collapse by about 75%,

43
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.940
75% something, which I'm sure you can imagine.

44
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.540
Let's do an immediate energy crisis around the entire planet.

45
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.680
And just a few months,

46
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.390
the price of oil sword by 150% inflation and unemployment

47
00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:45.290
skyrocketed throughout the Western world and fuel shortages caused Americans to

48
00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:48.680
wait hours in long Hughes, just to be able to fill up their gas tanks.

49
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.220
Suddenly Americans understood that the distant Persian Gulf was essential

50
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.090
imperative, absolutely key to the health and stability of the world economy.

51
00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.550
And at the time things looked so bad that in 1980 U S president Jimmy Carter,

52
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.910
and remember this is a president known mostly for not wanting to know anything

53
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:06.520
about military interventions was forced to take action

54
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.190
In his state of the union address in January,

55
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.730
1980 Carter blue came to that United States would use whatever force was

56
00:03:17.731 --> 00:03:20.850
necessary to safeguard the oil fields in the Persian Gulf.

57
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.040
It is what became known as the Carter doctrine.

58
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.330
Of course at the time the Soviet union was first and foremost in his mind in

59
00:03:27.331 --> 00:03:29.850
Washington, they were terrified that the Soviet empire,

60
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.750
which at the time was bordering Iran and also had thousands of combat troops

61
00:03:33.751 --> 00:03:38.010
deployed in Afghanistan would take advantage of the chaos to invade that region.

62
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.910
<v 2>This situation demands,</v>

63
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.680
careful thought steady nerves and resolute action, not only for this year,

64
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.110
but for many years to come,

65
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.860
it demands collective efforts to meet this new threat to security in the Persian

66
00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:54.600
Gulf and in Southwest Asia.

67
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.230
<v 1>And since then, all us presidents,</v>

68
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.980
both Democrats and Republicans alike have adopted the Carter doctrine as their

69
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.150
own, since it was launched.

70
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.990
This policy was perhaps the most important item on the U S foreign agenda.

71
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.680
And one of the critical elements on which international order is based.

72
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.480
Don't forget the we're talking about a strategy,

73
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.020
a policy that has resulted in endless military interventions.

74
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.190
These include operation.

75
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.780
Ernest will the largest Naval escort operative since world war two to the first

76
00:04:21.781 --> 00:04:26.520
Gulf war operation desert Fox and the Iraq war among dozens and dozens of

77
00:04:26.521 --> 00:04:27.354
operations.

78
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.300
It is also the same car to doctrine,

79
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.500
but explained to the United States having more than 55,000 combat units

80
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.330
permanently deployed in the middle East.

81
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.700
According to data collected by the Washington post,

82
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.750
we are talking about a mammoth deployment that includes intelligence units,

83
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.020
special operation groups, bomber squadrons. And for example,

84
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.470
the us Navy fifth fleet, a fleet led by the aircraft carrier,

85
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.120
USS Dwight D Eisenhower and consisting of more than 20 warships and more than

86
00:04:57.121 --> 00:04:59.970
15,000 soldiers since mid 2019.

87
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.660
This presence in the Gulf even includes the Juul of the us air force,

88
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.130
the F 22 rappers.

89
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:09.150
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

90
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.750
<v 1>Despite such an arsenal being poised and ready to face all out war.</v>

91
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.020
The truth is that the Obama administration in its second term,

92
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.290
and particularly the Trump administration have tried to enter this Carter

93
00:05:19.291 --> 00:05:20.520
doctrine Watson for RO,

94
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.830
why we've talked about this a lot here on visual politics,

95
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.480
thanks to the fracking revolution.

96
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.170
The Persian Gulf is apparently no longer as important to the world economy as it

97
00:05:28.171 --> 00:05:29.130
was just a few years ago.

98
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:34.590
<v 0>But.</v>

99
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:35.610
<v 1>When it comes to the truth,</v>

100
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.040
the United States has come up against the harsh reality.

101
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.850
All signs indicate that its Arab allies are enabled to ensure stability in this

102
00:05:41.851 --> 00:05:45.060
region of the world. And that's something that makes us sit up and take notice.

103
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.200
When we consider that Gulf Petro monarchies have been spending real fortunes on

104
00:05:49.201 --> 00:05:51.420
their armed forces for years, for example,

105
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.860
Saudi Arabia alone has spent more than $300 billion on its armed forces over the

106
00:05:55.861 --> 00:05:57.890
past five years, year after year,

107
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.340
Saudi Arabia is the third ranking country in the world for having the largest

108
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:04.520
military behind only the United States and China. And of course,

109
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:06.020
it's not just about Saudi Arabia,

110
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.830
the rest of the Arab Gulf countries also spend a real fortune on their armies to

111
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:14.060
get an idea that United Arab Emirates has a military budget equivalent to that

112
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.500
of.

113
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.333
<v 0>Right.</v>

114
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.910
<v 1>However,</v>

115
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.540
despite all the tens and tens of billions of dollars that Petrie monarchy spent

116
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.630
every year on their armed forces, every time something happens,

117
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.880
we always end up encountering news like this.

118
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.220
<v 0>October, 2019,</v>

119
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.820
Trump is sending more troops to Saudi Arabia foreign policy.

120
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.880
<v 1>And it's at this point that two questions need to be asked.</v>

121
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.000
Why do golf shakes spend so much money on their armed forces?

122
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:43.900
And more importantly,

123
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.610
what on earth is going on that these forces continue to be so inept friends,

124
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.450
Saudi Arabia has one of the largest and most expensive armies on the planet.

125
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.970
It's the most significant buyer of us weaponry.

126
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.590
And yet when it comes to the crunch,

127
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.530
a simple drone strike is able to bring the kingdom to its knees.

128
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.860
Let's not even get started about defending the sea lanes in the Strait of

129
00:07:02.861 --> 00:07:07.300
Hormuz. For those of you who don't know,

130
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.140
the Strait of Hormuz is a narrow strip of water through which about one fifth of

131
00:07:11.141 --> 00:07:13.600
all oil production in the world passes every day,

132
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.130
almost 20 million barrels of oil. That is we are talking about the main artery,

133
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.150
the most important artery in the economic systems of all Arab countries,

134
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.590
the place where their crude oil exports pass through and therefore the path for

135
00:07:26.591 --> 00:07:29.650
converting their oil into the coveted petrodollars. Well,

136
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.280
despite this and the tens and tens of thousands of millions of dollars spent

137
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.810
each year on their armed forces,

138
00:07:34.811 --> 00:07:37.540
it is not clear that they were even able to keep this passage open.

139
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.100
What's the reason for such a disaster.

140
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.270
How is it possible that so much money is spent and yet they are not even able to

141
00:07:46.271 --> 00:07:49.300
protect the root that guarantees their immense wealth? Well,

142
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.870
we can find at least three reasons for such abject failure, listen up.

143
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.880
<v 0>Siri sticky fingers, let's be on it.</v>

144
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.450
<v 1>Defense spending is often the most patriotic and at the same time,</v>

145
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.020
the most opaque and touchy part of all budgets for the vast majority of

146
00:08:11.021 --> 00:08:13.870
governments, according to transparency, international estimates,

147
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:18.280
more than $20 billion each year disappears due to corruption linked to the

148
00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:20.890
military industry. And you know what? It's not that surprising.

149
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.910
Think about it for a moment.

150
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.510
Military equipment purchases are made from very few manufacturers.

151
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.920
So competition is reduced.

152
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.980
Contracts are arbitrarily decided by just a few people.

153
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:34.210
And it's very easy to justify virtually any move with two magic words,

154
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.130
national security, As you can see,

155
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.830
we are looking at the perfect breeding ground for corruption,

156
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.530
and you may be surprised, but scientific studies seem clear.

157
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.950
There is a direct correlation between military spending and corruption.

158
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.090
Of course not all places are the same.

159
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.060
The more opaque the institutions in a particular country, the,

160
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.940
the impact these issues will have.

161
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.370
And I'm sure no one will be surprised to hear that in this matter,

162
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.090
the Petro monarchies in the Persian Gulf take first prize with the exception of

163
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:03.540
Kuwait,

164
00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:07.590
which more or less has a relatively operational parliament in these countries,

165
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.340
the making of any government decision and especially those related in military

166
00:09:11.341 --> 00:09:14.880
spending is absolutely dependent on the Royal families in practice.

167
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:18.240
These countries are managed as family estates and that makes the institutions

168
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.910
very opaque and with very limited scope to control,

169
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.770
if you have influence and are well connected,

170
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.860
you're in the perfect situation to fill your pockets with public contracts.

171
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.850
This explains why it is that in these countries. Yeah,

172
00:09:31.851 --> 00:09:36.050
acquisition of weapons has usually been accompanied by enormous overpricing and

173
00:09:36.051 --> 00:09:37.130
kickbacks bribes,

174
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.550
and the greasing of palms that are filled the pockets of many princes and high

175
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:41.503
or authorities.

176
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:46.340
<v 3>Defense related projects are highly secretive and subject to no ministry of</v>

177
00:09:46.341 --> 00:09:50.540
finance oversight or controls Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin. Talal.

178
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.960
<v 1>One of the most famous cases was that off Prince Bandar in Salta,</v>

179
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:57.950
former Saudi ambassador to Washington and former head of the Saudi intelligence

180
00:09:57.951 --> 00:09:58.784
service.

181
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.580
This has been disclosed. This Prince bought an entire village,

182
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.930
an 800 hectares of land in an area of central England with the money he received

183
00:10:08.931 --> 00:10:13.430
in bribes for his part in a mega contract signed in 1985 to buy the tornado

184
00:10:13.431 --> 00:10:15.830
fighter bomber a contract that in 20 years,

185
00:10:15.831 --> 00:10:19.370
but a total of more than 40 billion pounds in the coffers of the British

186
00:10:19.371 --> 00:10:22.100
military aircraft manufacturer BAE systems,

187
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.700
we are talking about the biggest agreement to sell military equipment in UK

188
00:10:25.701 --> 00:10:26.990
history, a contract,

189
00:10:26.991 --> 00:10:30.290
which more than 6 billion pounds in bribes could have been paid according to

190
00:10:30.291 --> 00:10:34.820
sources in the British press itself. That is more than $12 billion in bribes.

191
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:35.361
In fact,

192
00:10:35.361 --> 00:10:38.990
Prince Bandar himself was pretty clear about the matter listen closely to the

193
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.730
statements he made in 2000. And one.

194
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:45.350
<v 3>If you tell me that building this whole country out of 400 billion that we</v>

195
00:10:45.351 --> 00:10:48.530
misused or got 50 billion, I'll tell you. Yeah.

196
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:50.870
So what we did not invent corruption.

197
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.170
This has happened since Adam and Eve it's human nature, Prince Bandar.

198
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.200
<v 1>Another example is that of Prince Minitab bin Abdullah,</v>

199
00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.320
who is suspected to have diverted a few billion dollars, you know,

200
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.720
just some small change from the Saudi national guard

201
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.590
to divert the money.

202
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:10.310
He hired Phantom employees and use them to pay real fortunes,

203
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.010
to buy equipment from companies that he owned. For example,

204
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.870
the purchase of walkie-talkies come on,

205
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.350
walkie talkies with a price tag similar to that of a Mercedes S-Class.

206
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:21.500
Can you imagine what a deal straight to your pocket? Of course,

207
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:22.131
but wait a minute.

208
00:11:22.131 --> 00:11:25.220
Don't think just for a moment that these princes were just a couple of isolated

209
00:11:25.221 --> 00:11:29.390
cases, not at all, perhaps these two cases illustrate a special kind of greed,

210
00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.570
but the truth is that it is a fairly common practice. In fact,

211
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.050
this explains why the countries of the Persian Gulf are among those with the

212
00:11:36.051 --> 00:11:39.920
worst results in defense integrity index developed by transparency

213
00:11:39.921 --> 00:11:43.430
international, but that's not the end of it. No, no, there's still more.

214
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.500
<v 0>[Inaudible] question of diplomacy.</v>

215
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.900
Look at this headline for the Gulf States, diplomacy involves buying weapons.

216
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.370
They don't need the economist.

217
00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:05.010
<v 1>In 2018 when the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia announced the blockade on</v>

218
00:12:05.011 --> 00:12:08.520
Qatar, this country's air force was almost a joke. However, do you know what?

219
00:12:08.521 --> 00:12:11.610
One of the first things the Qatari government did to respond to this blockade

220
00:12:11.611 --> 00:12:15.390
was nothing less than signing more than $20 billion in contracts.

221
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:19.800
So by nearly 100 new aircraft from three different countries, the American FFT,

222
00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:24.120
the French Rafale and European Euro fighters PATAR did not even have enough

223
00:12:24.121 --> 00:12:27.600
pilots to operate this new air force, a new combat force larger than that.

224
00:12:27.601 --> 00:12:28.980
Of most European countries.

225
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.640
You see Gulf Petrie monarchies have a common practice spending a fistful of

226
00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.320
Petro dollars on new military toys.

227
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.050
Every time they want to improve their international relations.

228
00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:39.720
And the truth is it's not such a foolish plat after rule.

229
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.060
The military industry only sells to governments.

230
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:46.260
So it's marketing campaigns of basically aimed at lobbying and the Arab shakes

231
00:12:46.261 --> 00:12:47.430
are very clear about it.

232
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.910
What better way to win the support of a bunch of politicians than to use the

233
00:12:50.911 --> 00:12:52.380
resources of the military.

234
00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.213
<v 0>Industry.</v>

235
00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.290
<v 1>Petri monarchies, not only buy equipment,</v>

236
00:12:58.291 --> 00:13:00.270
they don't need all that is overpriced.

237
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:04.050
They sometimes buy non-compatible equipment from different sellers. For example,

238
00:13:04.051 --> 00:13:04.531
in the case,

239
00:13:04.531 --> 00:13:08.910
we have seen of Qatar buying the fifteens Rafale and Euro fighters will mean

240
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.360
having to train their pilots in three different combat systems stocking up on

241
00:13:12.361 --> 00:13:15.930
spare parts for the various aircraft and having to develop different processes

242
00:13:15.931 --> 00:13:17.880
for the maintenance and use of each of the models.

243
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:21.773
<v 0>Which doesn't make sense.</v>

244
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.420
<v 1>Not only does it make the budget more expensive,</v>

245
00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.340
but it undermines combat capacity,

246
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:29.850
but what difference does it make fundamentally the purpose of the contract had

247
00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:32.850
as much to do with public relations as it did with defense.

248
00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:38.910
<v 0>It's all about control.</v>

249
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:46.620
<v 1>There is still a third factor that explains why Arab armies are often so</v>

250
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.380
expensive and at the same time. So in operative,

251
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:53.250
this factor has a lot to do with control and what the international Institute

252
00:13:53.251 --> 00:13:57.480
for strategic studies calls the brightness factor that is to take on the most

253
00:13:57.481 --> 00:13:58.110
expensive,

254
00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:02.250
most modern and most striking weapons to reinforce the popularity of governments

255
00:14:02.251 --> 00:14:06.150
among the people to feed national pride and ultimately to act as a highly

256
00:14:06.151 --> 00:14:08.610
visible elements of deterrence to their enemies.

257
00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.200
Then there's also the issue of the arms race.

258
00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.020
The first goal of Arab monarchies is to protect themselves.

259
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.840
So armies have to be very well controlled. In other words,

260
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.810
if you're an Arab shake, you don't necessarily want the best army,

261
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.850
but a very loyal army. And for that,

262
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:27.420
it takes three things to keep the military happy and feeling that you take them

263
00:14:27.421 --> 00:14:30.590
into account, what better way than to give them the latest equipment,

264
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:32.820
pay them well, and make sure that the officers remained.

265
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.043
<v 0>Loyal.</v>

266
00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.810
<v 1>In these countries. Military careers are not about choosing the best candidates,</v>

267
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.150
but the most submissive or those closest to power.

268
00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.140
That is why high ranking commanders tend to be chosen from certain circles or

269
00:14:46.141 --> 00:14:49.350
clans, particularly close to those of the Royal family, even.

270
00:14:49.351 --> 00:14:53.480
So the applicants are subjected to investigation, not only for their background,

271
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.850
but also the background of their family. Then once chosen,

272
00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.110
they are paid very well.

273
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:01.070
For example,

274
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:06.050
a Colonel's monthly salary in the United Arab Emirates is just over $27,000 per

275
00:15:06.051 --> 00:15:08.960
month tax-free and if they also travel abroad,

276
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:12.920
then they get paid an additional $1,000 for each day that they spend outside the

277
00:15:12.921 --> 00:15:13.754
country.

278
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.050
Once you've chosen them and then pay them very well,

279
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.960
then you give them the best ways to keep them entertained. And that's it.

280
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:23.540
You're all set friends. As you can see, in many cases,

281
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:27.230
the armies in these Arab countries have been built on very weak foundations

282
00:15:27.231 --> 00:15:29.960
where military effectiveness was the least important factor.

283
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:33.830
And that explains precisely why they're so expensive and at the same time.

284
00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:34.693
So defective.

285
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.900
Now when the time of reckoning arrives,

286
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.870
which armies are best prepared for confrontation,

287
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.710
the Iranian army or those armies from Arab Petrie monarchies. Well,

288
00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:48.080
that is something that we'll examine in an upcoming video.

289
00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.900
So don't forget to subscribe to visual politics in any case,

290
00:15:50.901 --> 00:15:53.270
despite everything that has happened over the last few years,

291
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.870
there has been one country that has made a huge leap forward in terms of the

292
00:15:56.871 --> 00:15:58.460
preparation of its armed forces,

293
00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.070
a country that is even being dubbed the Arab spotter.

294
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:04.490
We talked about it here in this past video here on visual politics,

295
00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.060
but now has this story of armies and petrodollars been interesting for you.

296
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:11.120
Well, if it has been, give us a, like, I really hope you enjoyed this video.
