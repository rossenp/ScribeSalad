<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.660
<v 1>Nagorno-Karabakh is one of those regions that you didn't even know existed until</v>

3
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.440
two weeks ago.

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.950
Suddenly it's now all over the media because it's the scene of the first open

5
00:00:15.951 --> 00:00:18.350
war between two nations that we've seen in a long time.

6
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.940
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

7
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.540
<v 1>You know, in visual politic, we often talk about asymmetric warfare gorillas,</v>

8
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:27.830
or maybe civil Wars,

9
00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:31.700
but it seemed that open Wars were kind of a thing of the past. However,

10
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.930
from Sunday, the 27th of September, 2020, until the time of making this video,

11
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.760
the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia has clocked up more than 6,000 deaths,

12
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.380
including about 50 civilians.

13
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.130
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

14
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.490
<v 1>Of course those numbers could be even higher because at least for now,</v>

15
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.900
the war is not over.

16
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.330
There is a real risk that we will end up seeing ethnic cleansing or even.

17
00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.810
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

18
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.260
<v 1>And for all this conflict is the issue of control of Nagorno-Karabakh.</v>

19
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.420
We are talking about a region of 4,400 square kilometers with about 150,000

20
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:12.260
inhabitants. Officially this territory belongs to Azerbaijan,

21
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.910
but in reality, almost the entire population is ethnically Armenian.

22
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:17.540
Sadly,

23
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.390
this is not the first time that something like this has happened in this region,

24
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.290
the first war and the Garneau Karabakh broke out in the late 1980s and ended the

25
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.540
lives of more than 30,000 people,

26
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.990
as well as rendering 1 million people displaced from both Armenian and

27
00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:34.070
Azerbaijani backgrounds since then minor skirmishes between the two armies have

28
00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:38.180
been a regular occurrence. In fact, in 2016, there was another collage,

29
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.350
the left almost 200 soldiers dead from both sites and had 15 civilians.

30
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:47.000
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

31
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.660
<v 1>We were talking about a conflict that goes back decades and in which the great</v>

32
00:01:50.661 --> 00:01:54.140
powers are unsure, which side to support for the moment.

33
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.480
The only country that has taken sides is Turkey,

34
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.150
which supports the Azeris on Friday. The 9th of October,

35
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.660
Russia saw Armenia and Azerbaijan done it with the objective of achieving a

36
00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:04.550
ceasefire. But hours later,

37
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.840
the Azerbaijani guns were again bombing the capital of Nagorno-Karabakh a city

38
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.070
called [inaudible].

39
00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.400
Many media sources are reporting this war as if it were an invasion by

40
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.720
Azerbaijan over Armenian territories. But the real story is much more complex.

41
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.540
What's one is right backhoe or the element.

42
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.570
It is very difficult to have an opinion in this case, but in this video,

43
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.600
we are going to outline at least the main issues, the height, the culture.

44
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.630
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

45
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.490
<v 1>And I know what many of you are probably thinking,</v>

46
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.150
this is not the first time we've talked about Nagorno-Karabakh on visual politic

47
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.320
in April of this year.

48
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.310
We told you how it looked like Armenia and Azerbaijan might be on the verge of

49
00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:41.870
signing a peace agreement.

50
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.410
It was the Munich security conference where Azerbaijani president Elle hum,

51
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.400
Leo and Armenian prime minister nickel [inaudible] were discussing the matter in

52
00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:52.370
the same room, but clearly we were rolling.

53
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.970
International politics is unpredictable and no one has a crystal ball.

54
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.310
In any case, it's important to recognize mistakes.

55
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.120
And it is precisely that reason that we have made this,

56
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.840
The question we are asking today is who is Russia going to support and who are

57
00:03:09.841 --> 00:03:12.720
the United States and the European union going to support?

58
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.140
Why has this war broken out right now? What exactly is happening?

59
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.470
And a granola quarterback today, we're going to answer all those questions,

60
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.330
but first let's look at a little bit of history.

61
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.350
<v 0>A story without heroes.</v>

62
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.300
<v 1>So at this point, I know what you're all wondering,</v>

63
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.560
who are the good guys and this story and principle is easy to empathize with

64
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.100
Armenia.

65
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.970
The Armenians are one of the most abused peoples in history to give you an idea

66
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.200
during the first world war,

67
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.700
the ultimate empire killed more than 2 million Armenians. And even today,

68
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.630
Turkey refuses to acknowledge the Armenian genocide ever happened.

69
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.640
What's more Armenia as a democracy.

70
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.670
And an interesting side note was the first Christian country.

71
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.983
<v 0>In history.</v>

72
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.580
<v 1>Can we say about Azerbaijan is a corrupt dictatorship with few rivals,</v>

73
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.060
the classic case of a country with enormous gas reserves whose profits have gone

74
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.820
directly into the pockets of the ruling oats.

75
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.810
That's explains why the Azerbaijani dictator Ilham Alia has one of the world's

76
00:04:09.811 --> 00:04:10.770
greatest fortunes.

77
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.590
The best thing we can say about this country is that it is one of the most

78
00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:14.880
secular countries in the world.

79
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.880
However,

80
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.000
if you think that the Azerbaijanis are the villains and that the Armenians are

81
00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:27.150
the avenging angels, I am sorry to say that you are wrong.

82
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.440
And this story there are simply no good guys. You see for centuries,

83
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.220
the Nagorno-Karabakh region was populated by both Armenian Christians and Azeri

84
00:04:35.221 --> 00:04:39.090
Shiite Muslims. This is good firmed by numerous censuses from the 19th century.

85
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.040
That time with Armenia and Azerbaijan were part of the Russian empire. However,

86
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.720
in 1918, these two countries became independent and guess what happened next?

87
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.230
They went to war a war that ended with Russia at this time,

88
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.450
communist invading those two countries again.

89
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.810
So once more Armenians and those areas were forced to live together under the

90
00:05:00.811 --> 00:05:02.970
protective mantle of the Soviet union.

91
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:05.220
<v 0>Since.</v>

92
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.260
<v 1>The time of Stalin back in 1923,</v>

93
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.160
Nagorno-Karabakh has belonged to the socialist Republic of Azerbaijan. Why?

94
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.320
Well, because that's the way Stalin wanted it.

95
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.170
I just tried to find anyone who would dare to oppose it.

96
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.970
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

97
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.670
<v 1>Things changed in 1998. At that time,</v>

98
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.820
Armenians living in the Garneau quarterback took advantage of the new political

99
00:05:26.821 --> 00:05:30.210
freedoms that Mikhail Gorbachev had put in place to cast a vote in the regional

100
00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:30.780
parliament,

101
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.110
a vote in which they asked that the region ceased to be parts of Azerbaijan and

102
00:05:34.111 --> 00:05:36.690
become part of the Republic of Armenia and stent.

103
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.600
Armenians living in this area complained that the backhoe government did not

104
00:05:39.601 --> 00:05:43.320
allow them to watch television or receive education in Armenian for their part.

105
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.170
The Azeris took to the streets to protest because they were not willing to give

106
00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:49.650
up the region and the Armenians. And yet that the same,

107
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.990
that's how the Nagorno-Karabakh war broke out.

108
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.640
<v 0>That did not end until 1994.</v>

109
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.210
<v 1>This war caused more than 30,000 casualties, including lots of civilians.</v>

110
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.640
And it resulted in more than a million displaced people.

111
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.540
The $850,000 series we've been living in the region had to relocate to other

112
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:12.920
parts of Azerbaijan and the $250,000 millions living in Azerbaijan had to move

113
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.940
to Armenia. And other words, we are talking about a total ethnic cleansing,

114
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.380
but left indelible wounds.

115
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.660
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

116
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.100
<v 1>You will see. So who won, who won the war? Well,</v>

117
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.960
we could say that the winner was Armenia,

118
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.290
although Nagorno-Karabakh has officially a regional Azerbaijan. In fact,

119
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.720
we are talking about the so-called art SAC Republic,

120
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.340
a state where the police are Armenian.

121
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:39.880
The currency they use is Armenian and the official language is Armenian.

122
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.900
The place is so controlled by Armenia that two of the last Armenian presidents

123
00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:47.020
were born and stood upon a character that is the capital of the art SAC

124
00:06:47.021 --> 00:06:50.350
Republic. All of this helps explain why this war has never ended

125
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.150
Or a peace agreement. Only a ceasefire was agreed since 1992,

126
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.320
the O S C E or the organization for security and cooperation in Europe has been

127
00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:05.950
trying to bring both sides together to negotiate a territorial agreements.

128
00:07:05.951 --> 00:07:10.090
But this negotiating table is cheered by France, Russia and the United States.

129
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.700
All these countries have huge Armenian diasporas.

130
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.900
So Azerbaijan has never been willing to negotiate with them. Meanwhile, Armenia,

131
00:07:16.901 --> 00:07:18.490
not only to kind of go into a counter back,

132
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.580
but also conquered all the territories that connect us region two.

133
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.233
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

134
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.110
<v 1>That is about 20% of the territory of Azerbaijan.</v>

135
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.130
And remember that there are more than 800,000 people who were expelled from the

136
00:07:33.131 --> 00:07:34.510
land where they had always lived.

137
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.860
All this explains the auntie Armenian hatred professed in back who hate that

138
00:07:38.861 --> 00:07:40.480
translates into statements.

139
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:41.613
<v 0>Like this.</v>

140
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:49.090
<v 2>Well, main enemies are Armenians of the world and the hypocritical and corrupt</v>

141
00:07:49.091 --> 00:07:53.350
politicians under their control. It'll ham LEF as oppose yarn president.

142
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.230
<v 1>And as you can imagine for the Elliot family,</v>

143
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.840
hatred of Armenia has become a major political tool.

144
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.470
It is the perfect antagonist to justified all kinds of abuses of power.

145
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:03.400
To give you an idea.

146
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:07.450
People like Kim Kardashian are considered public enemies and Azerbaijan.

147
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.470
I don't know if you knew this,

148
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.610
but Kim Kardashian is of Armenian origin and for the [inaudible] narrative,

149
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.640
she is one more of the many Armenians who spread propaganda,

150
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.480
wherever they go consider that most of the Armenian population currently lives

151
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.560
outside the country.

152
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:24.220
There are more than 8 million Armenians living in countries like the United

153
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.270
States or Russia. And that's Armenian diaspora feeds Azerbaijan's persecution.

154
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.170
[inaudible] Because if you think that Armenia is willing to negotiate, boy,

155
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.390
Oh boy, are you wrong to date?

156
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.260
Armenia is only willing to maintain the status quo that has to keep its Republic

157
00:08:41.261 --> 00:08:45.580
of oxide clean of Azeris also, and all the surrounding regions too. For example,

158
00:08:45.581 --> 00:08:46.510
in 2007,

159
00:08:46.511 --> 00:08:49.840
the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan sat down to negotiate and

160
00:08:49.841 --> 00:08:52.600
Madrid. This led to the so-called Madrid principle.

161
00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:56.763
<v 0>[Inaudible] principles say.</v>

162
00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.060
<v 1>That Armenia should allow the return of the Azeris who were living in Nagorno.</v>

163
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.670
And afterwards all the inhabitants of the region,

164
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.330
including the Azeris to hold a referendum on self-determination.

165
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.570
This referendum would be monitored by international security forces.

166
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.140
This would imply the Armenia would withdraw its troops.

167
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.500
And that is something that neither Yerevan nor the rest of the Armenian

168
00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:17.010
diaspora,

169
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.670
except most significantly the Armenian association in the United States has

170
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:22.830
rejected these principles as undemocratic.

171
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:31.220
In other words, neither country is willing to give an inch to achieve peace.

172
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.600
And that is why to date no major power has decided to support either site.

173
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:40.580
So what has changed since then? Well, one thing that has changed is the economy

174
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:48.200
In 1994, Armenia and Azerbaijan were two equally poor countries.

175
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.840
We could say that they were in a kind of Mexican standoff,

176
00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.050
not as both countries had similar amounts of power and decided to approve a

177
00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:57.980
ceasefire since then Armenia's economy has grown at the same rate as the rest of

178
00:09:57.981 --> 00:09:59.660
the countries in the region. Meanwhile,

179
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.170
Azerbaijan story has been completely different in 1999.

180
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:07.940
Azerbaijan discovered something that changed his economy forever deep beneath

181
00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:12.320
the Caspian sea. A trillion cubic meters is waiting to be tapped.

182
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.740
We are talking about the shot in these guests fields in the Caspian sea,

183
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:17.630
one of the largest gas fuels in the world,

184
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.350
suddenly Azerbaijan's GDP skyrocketed take a look at this graph.

185
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:24.800
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

186
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.160
<v 1>To date, Azerbaijan has almost quadrupled Armenia's GDP,</v>

187
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.160
and all this wealth has been converted into an army.

188
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.050
Since Azerbaijan has become a guest power,

189
00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.320
they have not stopped signing defense agreements with a whole host of countries.

190
00:10:36.321 --> 00:10:38.750
And that includes Russia, Israel, and Turkey.

191
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.410
And at about that moment is when the powers and back who said Armenia.

192
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.440
Do you remember that ceasefire that we approved because of the Mexican standoff?

193
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.540
Well, you're going to find out what.

194
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:48.463
<v 0>We meet.</v>

195
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.910
<v 1>Oh, Karabakh violence,</v>

196
00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:58.130
worse clashes in decades killed dozens as news from 2016. At that time,

197
00:10:58.131 --> 00:11:01.280
the war lasted just five days and resulted in 200 casualties.

198
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.800
Despite the fact that Azerbaijan had more modern weapons,

199
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.450
the Armenians managed to hold them off.

200
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.570
Remember with the whole area is controlled by Armenian troops,

201
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.130
that these troops are very well.

202
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.500
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

203
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.830
<v 1>Other words Azerbaijan wanted to prove it's a periodicity over Armenia and</v>

204
00:11:18.831 --> 00:11:22.070
discovered that war was simply not a matter of money and weaponry.

205
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.400
Just ask the Saudi Arabian army in Yemen. Once again,

206
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.830
it seemed there was a certain balance of power at play.

207
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.500
So now you might be thinking, so what has changed? Well,

208
00:11:30.501 --> 00:11:33.890
listen up because to understand that we have to pack our bags and travel to a

209
00:11:33.891 --> 00:11:34.724
completely.

210
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:35.900
<v 0>Different country.</v>

211
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:45.530
<v 1>The awakening of the Ottoman giant 15th, 2016,</v>

212
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.230
we'll be forever remembered as the date of the failed coup d'etat.

213
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.213
<v 0>In Turkey.</v>

214
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.070
We've it several times here.

215
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.350
<v 1>On visual politic for Turkish president, everyone,</v>

216
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.140
this coup was a golden opportunity. Traditionally,

217
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:02.230
the Turkish army had been mainly Kemalists. In other words,

218
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:06.070
they were in favor of a secular and Western Turkey. Edwin however,

219
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.270
argued for the opposite. Many define his ideology as new optimism.

220
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:14.800
That is a return to the Ottoman empire or resurgence of Turkish nationalism.

221
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.090
As you can imagine, in order to carry out such an expansionist policy,

222
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.160
it's essential to have the army on your site.

223
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.020
And that is why after the coup de top,

224
00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.930
everyone changed the constitution and carried out policies.

225
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.273
<v 0>Yes.</v>

226
00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.950
<v 3>Ode again, purge is army and you disarray after failed coup.</v>

227
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:39.090
<v 1>And all this explains the turn that Turkish politics have taken since 2016,</v>

228
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:43.500
to give you an idea. Turkey is going through a very significant economic crisis.

229
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:47.700
In 2013, the GDP was $951 billion.

230
00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:52.200
Six years later in 2019, it is at 754 billion. However,

231
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.870
despite the fact that the Turkish economy is going from bad to worse,

232
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.290
everyone's army is present on all possible fronts. Take a look.

233
00:12:58.530 --> 00:12:59.363
<v 0>Right?</v>

234
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.540
<v 1>I present to you the doctrine of MAVA tan, the blue hormone,</v>

235
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:09.030
you're likely to get tired of hearing. It mentioned in the coming months,

236
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.510
Turkey wants to control all the seas surrounding the Mediterranean seat,

237
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.100
the GNC and the black seat.

238
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.430
This explains why the Turks are so present in the Wars and Olympia and why they

239
00:13:17.431 --> 00:13:19.620
have entered into confrontations with Greece.

240
00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:23.730
But not only that Turkey is also interested in controlling the Persian Gulf and

241
00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.920
the Caspian sea. And you'll probably be thinking,

242
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:30.990
why are they so interested in controlling the seas? Well, for two reasons,

243
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:34.320
on the one hand, pure nationalist rhetoric on the other hand,

244
00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:39.150
energy and dependence until recently both the oil and gas consumed by Turkey

245
00:13:39.151 --> 00:13:41.730
came from two suppliers, Russia and Iran,

246
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.950
both countries have been traditional antagonists.

247
00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.100
However things started to change in 2019.

248
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:51.690
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

249
00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.190
<v 3>Turkey and Azerbaijan,</v>

250
00:13:53.191 --> 00:13:56.850
Mark completion of tan app pipeline to take gas to Europe.

251
00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.720
<v 1>Remember how I told you that Neil automatism as a form of ethno nationalism,</v>

252
00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:04.860
that is Turkish. Nationalism is not based on religion nor on a political system,

253
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.870
but on a common race and culture.

254
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.230
The Azeris are a Turkic people with very similar language, ethnicity,

255
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.160
and culture. And that's why both LEF and everyone get along so well.

256
00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:15.690
And previous visual policy videos,

257
00:14:15.691 --> 00:14:17.640
we told you about the Turkish military industry,

258
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.470
but has been revived thanks to air to war.

259
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.650
No Turkey has its own mess out of launches, laser weapons,

260
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:27.330
and even its own drones. For example, the [inaudible] is very well known. Well,

261
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.270
one of his biggest buyers is none other than Azerbaijan.

262
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:34.500
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

263
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:39.180
<v 3>Turkey as a [inaudible] deepen defense industry cooperation with new bilateral</v>

264
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:39.840
agreement.

265
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.850
<v 1>This news headline is from May, 2020,</v>

266
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.060
but this time the by Johnny army was already supplied with Turkish,

267
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.150
Russian and Israeli weapons. And this means one thing and the coop,

268
00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.150
we can finally beat the Armenians. Not only did their dictator,

269
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.810
Elle Hom Ali I've think so, but so did the Azerbaijanis.

270
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.010
<v 0>[Inaudible] protestors demand war after Armenia clashes.</v>

271
00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:03.940
<v 1>Around this time,</v>

272
00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.990
some countries like Canada decided to stop adding fuel to the fire and bond on

273
00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.700
sales to Azerbaijan. Meanwhile,

274
00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.550
Ankara has been encouraging back here to give you an idea.

275
00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.220
Turkish support of the Azerbaijani army is so evident.

276
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.100
They even on the website of the ministry of defense in Azerbaijan,

277
00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.600
we find pictures like.

278
00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.553
<v 0>This.</v>

279
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:24.670
<v 1>But I know what many of you are thinking.</v>

280
00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.850
Turkey is not the only country that has sold arms to Azerbaijan.

281
00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.690
So why is Turkey support so important and this war? Well, to understand this,

282
00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.950
we have to go back even further and tight watch out because a spine movie is

283
00:15:35.951 --> 00:15:36.784
about to start.

284
00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.570
<v 0>The impossible alliances.</v>

285
00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.170
<v 1>Syria, 2012 Syrian rebels rise up against the dictator.</v>

286
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:50.200
Alisando many asks the us to intervene at that time.

287
00:15:50.201 --> 00:15:51.610
The president was Barack Obama.

288
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.880
Barack Obama was tired of sending his army to fight Wars in the middle.

289
00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:56.223
<v 0>East.</v>

290
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:03.730
<v 1>So instead of making big military moves, he chose to call the guys at Langley.</v>

291
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:07.150
That's how the CIA created the timber second war program to this day.

292
00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:10.660
This program remains classified. So there is very little information about it.

293
00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:14.770
But what little we do know is that the CIA has been buying weapons on the black

294
00:16:14.771 --> 00:16:19.450
market Balkans.

295
00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:20.500
And what kind of weapons,

296
00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.530
AK 40 sevens nightmares and goggles and grenade launchers.

297
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.410
These weapons were used to are many of the groups fighting. Alison,

298
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:29.350
on the other hand, the CIA was training these folks.

299
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:35.140
Yes, I know what you're thinking. And you're right.

300
00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:39.520
Many of these groups were organizations of how should we put this organizations

301
00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:40.600
of the dubious?

302
00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.650
Stancher it's still not clear who received these weapons and training from the

303
00:16:44.651 --> 00:16:45.400
CIA,

304
00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:48.760
but it will not be the first time the United States ends up giving weapons to

305
00:16:48.761 --> 00:16:50.350
those who will later on. Okay.

306
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:51.663
<v 0>Enemies.</v>

307
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:58.210
<v 1>As soon as Donald Trump set foot in the white house,</v>

308
00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.120
the timber second more program was canceled overnight.

309
00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.000
Tens of thousands of Syrian gorillas with first class,

310
00:17:04.001 --> 00:17:08.770
military training were left without us support. This is where Turkey comes in.

311
00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:11.140
This is who the Syrian national army was born.

312
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.930
A group of mercenaries in the service of Turkey.

313
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:18.820
Each one charges between $1,502,000 a month and has the right to apply for

314
00:17:18.821 --> 00:17:19.654
Turkish citizens.

315
00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:20.493
<v 0>Sure.</v>

316
00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.610
<v 1>Remember I told you that the army of Azerbaijan is not as well trained as that</v>

317
00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:32.050
of Armenia. Well, no Turkey has been able to solve this problem.

318
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:36.430
It is estimated that between 701,000 Syrian mercenaries under contract to

319
00:17:36.431 --> 00:17:39.430
Turkey, I've been fighting in the war and Nagorno-Karabakh of course,

320
00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:43.150
everyone denies all these accusations, but news headlines like this,

321
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.433
we speak for themselves.

322
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.280
<v 0>No goal, no Karabakh at least three.</v>

323
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.110
<v 4>Syrian fighters killed. Of course.</v>

324
00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:56.390
<v 1>Some might say that these Syrian fighters were just passing by and said,</v>

325
00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.450
come on, let's get involved in a war in a country that we don't know.

326
00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.640
Let's go fight over there and see what happens.

327
00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:06.380
But it seems more reasonable to think that Turkey has paid them to fight their

328
00:18:06.381 --> 00:18:08.750
war. So we have Azerbaijan on the one hand,

329
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:10.640
which has four times the money than Armenia,

330
00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.790
large gas reserves and the unconditional support.

331
00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:14.913
<v 0>Turkey.</v>

332
00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:21.290
<v 1>So the question now is who is supporting Armenia.</v>

333
00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:23.630
And for the time being the answer is no one,

334
00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.120
one of his possible allies would be around. But for the moment,

335
00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.900
Iran has limited itself to securing its border by placing 200 times along the

336
00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:32.660
frontier to prevent the war from spilling over to their site,

337
00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.510
Russia as a traditional ally of Armenia. In fact,

338
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:39.320
as a military based in the city of camaraderie with more than 3000 soldiers,

339
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:46.610
We're over Armenia is a member of the collective security treaty organization,

340
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.890
which is something like the Russian NATO and principle.

341
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:50.780
If Azerbaijan were to attack Armenia,

342
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:53.420
Russia would be obliged to come to its defense,

343
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:57.980
but don't forget that Nagorno-Karabakh is officially part of Azerbaijani

344
00:18:57.981 --> 00:19:01.970
territory. Technically Azerbaijan has not invaded any country.

345
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.270
It is simply trying to regain a territory that belongs to.

346
00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.990
And now you're probably thinking since when is Russia a country that respects

347
00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:12.170
international law? Is it not in Putin's interest to control the caucuses,

348
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.270
of course, as, but for several years now,

349
00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:17.240
Moscow and Bakula have been cultivating good relations.

350
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.730
We explained it to you on visual politic two years ago,

351
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.420
Russia and Azerbaijan need each other to be able to send their guests to Europe.

352
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.480
What's more, Russia has serious problems in the caucuses regions,

353
00:19:26.481 --> 00:19:30.050
such as Chechnya and Dagestan are possible focuses of Islamic terrorism.

354
00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.500
The last thing most school wants is to have Islamic attacks on its own

355
00:19:33.501 --> 00:19:36.740
territory. If all of a sudden Russia were to attack Azerbaijan,

356
00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:40.020
which is a Muslim country back who could very well straight back.

357
00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:47.300
The truth is that the European union needs gas from Azerbaijan to reduce its

358
00:19:47.301 --> 00:19:49.400
dependence on Russia. In other words,

359
00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.370
Turkey is the only power that wants to enter this conflict.

360
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:56.180
And all of this explains Moscow's interest and trying to negotiate a ceasefire

361
00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.320
as soon as possible.

362
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:02.660
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

363
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.540
<v 4>Armenia and Azerbaijan agree ceasefire.</v>

364
00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:06.410
<v 1>However,</v>

365
00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:10.430
this ceasefire has been agreed on without Turkey and air one has already said

366
00:20:10.431 --> 00:20:13.790
that it's just a truce I Teresa Armenia to withdraw all of its troops from

367
00:20:13.791 --> 00:20:17.480
Nagorno-Karabakh new concessions. So hours after the ceasefire was approved,

368
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.600
the Azerbaijani guns again, fired missiles. I should a panic.

369
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.090
So no, the question is over to you.

370
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:29.660
Do you think Russia or NATO will end up getting involved in this conflict? Well,

371
00:20:29.661 --> 00:20:32.630
we end up seeing the definitive end of this war with a peace agreement.

372
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:36.140
More importantly. What do you think about Turkey's role in this conflict?

373
00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:39.620
To what extent are they responsible for what is happening in the granola counter

374
00:20:39.621 --> 00:20:42.290
back? We'll leave your answers in the comments and as always.

375
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.850
<v 0>I'll see you next time.</v>
