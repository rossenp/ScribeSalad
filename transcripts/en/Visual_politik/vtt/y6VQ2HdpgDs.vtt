00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.200
<v 1>The cosmos the universe is an idea, a place,</v>

2
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.160
a concept that has been haunting the human mind for literally thousands and

3
00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:24.770
thousands of years from time and Memorial.

4
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.090
Our species has been strongly interested in and influenced by the stars.

5
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.720
Just think about it for one moment with the history of Meritain dread have been

6
00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:35.990
possible without the astrolabe with the development of agriculture and medieval

7
00:00:35.991 --> 00:00:39.290
Europe have been possible ever tangent had not been paid to do the cosmos.

8
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.400
Something that helped our ancestors knew when the time was right for each stage

9
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.320
of cultivation. And of course,

10
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.980
beyond studying the universe for such practical means we cannot forget or even

11
00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:52.580
deny that the stars have also had a strong influence and enormous attraction,

12
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.020
an amazing power to give flight to our fantasy and imagination all the way back

13
00:00:57.021 --> 00:01:00.140
in the second century and his work, a true story right there.

14
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.820
[inaudible] fantasize about the idea of reaching the stars of seeing extra

15
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.691
terrestrial worlds,

16
00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:08.990
and even imagined Wars between the monarchs of other planets.

17
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.600
And he was not the only one since then many others like Siriano to bear Jack

18
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.260
Daniel, the, and of course, Jules Verne.

19
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.340
They continued to fantasize about flying to destined alien worlds,

20
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.050
but don't worry. Don't panic.

21
00:01:21.051 --> 00:01:24.350
This video is not about the history of astronomy or science fair

22
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.570
On the 20th of December, 2019, president Donald J.

23
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.750
Trump signed as this customer in the defense budget for the following year.

24
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.810
However, in the act S one seven nine zero,

25
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.680
there was something that was far from normal. You see, on that day,

26
00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:43.910
Andrews air force base,

27
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.680
president Donald Trump created the U S S F the United States space force.

28
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.560
And the question is, was this more than just a headline?

29
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.320
Has there ever been anything like this before in the United States,

30
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.260
are there plans to militarize space with weapons, orbiting the earth?

31
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.950
Are we about to have all of our Saifai fantasies come true? Well,

32
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.990
today we will answer all of those questions,

33
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.880
but first we need to look at some history.

34
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.040
<v 0>The race for space domination.</v>

35
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.100
<v 1>The 1950s, the cold war two Titans at odds,</v>

36
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.650
a struggle between communism and capitalism,

37
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.010
the Soviet union versus the United States. You could say,

38
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.130
but the starting gun that marked the beginning of the space race was fired by

39
00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:31.640
the Soviet union. On the 4th of October, 1957. On that day,

40
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.300
the split Nick one satellite was put into orbit. And as you can imagine,

41
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.790
over in the land of rock and roll Apple pie and hamburgers,

42
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.700
the launch of Sputnik left a pretty bad taste in the mouth.

43
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.550
It was totally unexpected. And to top it all off,

44
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.370
it wasn't the only one less than a month later,

45
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.650
the USSR was launching its Sputnik too,

46
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.190
sadly famous for launching the poor little dog Laika as a crew member.

47
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.090
Let's all take a moment. It's just so sad.

48
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.030
The fact that as though it wasn't until the following year in 1958,

49
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.720
that the Americans were finally able to move their plane piece from the starting

50
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:05.680
box. And this particular risks, the Denso the launch of their first satellite,

51
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.970
the Explorer one.

52
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:12.060
<v 0>Blitz.</v>

53
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.970
<v 1>Although the Americans got their act together with their first satellite and the</v>

54
00:03:14.971 --> 00:03:19.620
creation of NASA in 1959 and 1961, the Soviets once again,

55
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.740
left the world at speechless on April 12th of that year,

56
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.910
a young Eureka garden became the first person to navigate and space upon his

57
00:03:26.911 --> 00:03:30.000
return. He was received as a true international superhero,

58
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.180
just a few weeks later, the American Alan Shepard followed him,

59
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.910
but of course they had already won that much and Moscow.

60
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.730
And the fact is during the first part of the space race,

61
00:03:38.731 --> 00:03:40.800
the Soviet union was clearly ahead.

62
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:44.400
The USSR managed to successfully conclude the mission after meshing,

63
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.190
abandoning the Earth's orbit landing on the moon. Yes.

64
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.730
Landing on the moon and even undertaking the first mission to Venus.

65
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.520
They seemed unstoppable. Listen up.

66
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.700
<v 2>Mine was the first soft landing mission on the moon.</v>

67
00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.750
The Soviet spacecraft rived three years before the first human stepped out on

68
00:04:00.751 --> 00:04:01.410
the surface.

69
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.000
It was part of a long range Soviet union program to photograph and learn more

70
00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:07.530
about the moon space.com.

71
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.090
<v 1>Hold on just one moment, because on the 25th of May in 1961,</v>

72
00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.090
something happened that would forever change the position of these counters.

73
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.070
On the particular game board, we're talking about.

74
00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.990
<v 0>Nothing.</v>

75
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.570
<v 1>John F. Kennedy gave a speech to the U S Congress.</v>

76
00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:29.520
And when she sets a new national priority to make a man clearly an American man

77
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.460
walk on the moon and returned home safely,

78
00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.870
they had to achieve this before the end of the 1960s. And as we often say,

79
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.980
no sooner said than done on the 20th of July in 1969,

80
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.120
the United States may be somewhat unique entry and to history on that day,

81
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.350
Neil Armstrong stepped onto the moon marking a giant leap from forward.

82
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.633
<v 0>Okay.</v>

83
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.700
<v 1>You're probably thinking at this point, you're thinking, all right, grant,</v>

84
00:05:02.701 --> 00:05:06.570
but these are all things that we know, but this is visual politic.

85
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.300
Our role is to try and look beyond and figure out what, wait,

86
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.050
what role and what political influence this kind of space race had.

87
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.020
And that is exactly what we're going to do. And the first thing,

88
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:19.590
the first key to understanding this whole story is to take a look at the main

89
00:05:19.591 --> 00:05:23.550
differences that existed between the Soviet and the American space programs for

90
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:24.330
decades.

91
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.163
<v 0>Geez.</v>

92
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:29.310
<v 1>You see,</v>

93
00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.940
although the Soviet union militarized its space race from very early on,

94
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.270
let's say that this was something that the Americans did not consider at first,

95
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.430
at least not in the same terms.

96
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.300
Let me explain president Eisenhower himself general, Dwight D Eisenhower,

97
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.710
Ike to his friends wrote to Bulgarian the president of the USSR council of

98
00:05:46.711 --> 00:05:49.140
ministers, and to Khrushchev his Soviet counterpart,

99
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:54.090
a series of letters in 1957 in 1958, to convince them to make the space mission,

100
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.030
a project of scientific cooperation between the two countries,

101
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.440
rather than a race. Of course he failed still.

102
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.190
The Americans did not throw in the toe soon after they created NASA and the same

103
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:07.820
spirit as a completely civilian, an independent agency. And not only that,

104
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:09.890
thanks to the space act of 1958,

105
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.760
American scientists had a lot of freedom to carry out the research on space.

106
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.440
This was very different from the USSR who space measuring was tightly controlled

107
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:21.080
by the ministry of general machine building of the USSR,

108
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.670
the ministry answering to the USS,

109
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:26.150
our military industrial commission of the USSR council of ministers,

110
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.920
who we go through, all those acronyms,

111
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.220
However, JFK, there's another acronym he tried again.

112
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.270
And the wake of Eisenhower.

113
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:39.710
JFK also tried to turn the space race into a space of Dante and cooperation with

114
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:42.500
his then arch enemy of the hammer. And second, and fact,

115
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.860
and his first speech as president, he uttered these words.

116
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.930
<v 0>Seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its parents.</v>

117
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.540
Again, explore the thought.

118
00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.300
<v 1>But my friends, Chris, Jeff,</v>

119
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:02.800
once again turned a deaf ear that selected hearing continued up until 1962,

120
00:07:02.801 --> 00:07:06.430
when the United States managed to put John Glenn into orbit. At that point,

121
00:07:06.431 --> 00:07:10.240
the Soviets finally began to test the ground for possible space cooperation with

122
00:07:10.241 --> 00:07:14.110
the Americans. And of course, Massa took up the gauntlet instantly.

123
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.950
The two great art enemies of the team reached an unprecedented agreement and

124
00:07:17.951 --> 00:07:21.910
agreement by which the undertook to share among other things, weather forecasts.

125
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.940
And yes, yes. I know it might seem insignificant,

126
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.750
but think about what that meant symbolically not to mention it was against the

127
00:07:28.751 --> 00:07:32.920
backdrop of the almost paranoid atmosphere of secrecy and the USSR.

128
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.100
So don't go thinking that this was a piece of cake because it was fun.

129
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:37.923
<v 0>It.</v>

130
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.780
<v 1>Of the Soviet union themselves. For example, Mr.</v>

131
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.640
[inaudible] president of the Academy of sciences did not see why on earth.

132
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.070
They had to share their findings with the enemy,

133
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.650
even though it was only about meteorological data,

134
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.910
but of course the context was terrible. Look at the case of coldish himself,

135
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.100
the president of the Academy of sciences checkup.

136
00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.530
<v 2>Academician coldish himself was the subject of paranoid secrecy for many</v>

137
00:08:05.531 --> 00:08:07.990
years. Kel dishes name was a state secret.

138
00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:12.730
He was known only as the anonymous chief theorist of cosmetics rolled

139
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.550
saga, Dave Russian expert in plasma physics,

140
00:08:15.551 --> 00:08:20.170
and a former director of the space research Institute of the USSR cademy of

141
00:08:20.171 --> 00:08:21.004
sciences.

142
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.031
<v 1>Seriously,</v>

143
00:08:22.031 --> 00:08:25.570
that kind of makes Cal there's something like the Voldemort of the USSR.

144
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.490
And as if that mistrust wasn't enough,

145
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.670
then Brezhnev came to the Kremlin and pulled the handbrake. And once again,

146
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.350
on all that, talking to the Americans.

147
00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:36.910
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

148
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:39.910
<v 1>I've had previously been the commissioner of all military industry issues before</v>

149
00:08:39.911 --> 00:08:42.160
entering the Politburo. And my friends,

150
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:46.330
Leonid Leonid was satin that the USSR had a clear advantage and that there was

151
00:08:46.331 --> 00:08:48.460
no point in collaborating with the Americans.

152
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:52.960
Why help them if they could beat them, but it turns out he was wrong.

153
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:57.690
Brezhnev had made a huge mistake. Why? Because just a few years later,

154
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.380
the next administration would overtake them with new Armstrong walking on the

155
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:05.340
moon and putting his little American flag on the surface of our closest heavenly

156
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.920
body. So with Armstrong's let those straw on the moon,

157
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.380
the moon and the Kremlin was no longer at the scene.

158
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.800
And then suddenly plot twist because it's here,

159
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:18.060
the Gregory Peck and gene Hackman appeared on the scene and yes, no, seriously,

160
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.230
I have not gone mental. I am being genuine. It turns out that in 1970,

161
00:09:22.231 --> 00:09:24.990
a top level meeting between the Soviet and American scientists,

162
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.870
the Americans came up with something that would leave the Russian scientists

163
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.610
very, very low

164
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.030
Phillip handler. Then president of the United States Academy of sciences,

165
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:39.290
starting talking to kale dish,

166
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:42.560
the chief scientist of the USSR about a film that had been released in

167
00:09:42.561 --> 00:09:43.394
Hollywood.

168
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.780
The film marooned told the story of three American astronauts who were lost in

169
00:09:47.781 --> 00:09:51.410
space and who were ultimately rescued by Soviet cosmonauts.

170
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:58.670
And let's just say that those raised in the land of the hammer and sickle had a

171
00:09:58.671 --> 00:10:02.060
little bit of trouble grasping all this. I mean, why,

172
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.480
why was Hollywood seeming to create Soviet propaganda?

173
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:08.960
What was up with that and take notes because handler actually managed to

174
00:10:08.961 --> 00:10:11.570
convince them that in the face of a catastrophic situation,

175
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.130
like the one presented in the film,

176
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:17.330
it would be necessary to have compatible systems in order to work together.

177
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:21.410
And what's even more surprising is they came to an agreement and not just a

178
00:10:21.411 --> 00:10:22.244
symbolic one,

179
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.960
but a historical agreement and the middle of the cold war with both

180
00:10:26.961 --> 00:10:29.720
countries, keeping their fingers poised on the nuclear button.

181
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:34.100
These two great enemies smoke to the peace pipe just long enough to develop the

182
00:10:34.101 --> 00:10:38.630
Apollo Soyuz collaboration project. That is impressive.

183
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:45.530
<v 3>New possibilities are opening up for fruitful</v>

184
00:10:45.531 --> 00:10:49.100
development of scientific cooperation between countries and the peoples in the

185
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.540
interest of peace and progress of all of humanity

186
00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:55.730
learned. But as still.

187
00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:00.620
<v 1>However, my friends on the 20th of January, 1981,</v>

188
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:05.330
the United States space strategy would take a 180 degree turn because my friends

189
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.290
on that day, a new man arrived at the white house. Listen to this.

190
00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.530
<v 0>Star Wars.</v>

191
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.420
<v 1>On the 20th of January, 1981,</v>

192
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:27.230
Ronald Wilson Reagan enter the white house with a seemingly crazy idea to

193
00:11:27.231 --> 00:11:30.380
disable the nuclear arsenal of their arch enemy, the Soviet union,

194
00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.430
his goal to render the threat, the idea of mutually assured destruction,

195
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.870
totally obsolete.

196
00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:40.040
So Ronald Reagan wanted to write off decades of military strategy.

197
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.420
<v 4>I call upon the scientific community in our country.</v>

198
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.700
Those who gave us nuclear weapons to turn their great talents now to the cause

199
00:11:49.701 --> 00:11:54.010
of mankind and world peace to give us the means rendering these.

200
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.010
<v 0>Nuclear weapons in an obsolete.</v>

201
00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:02.160
<v 1>And the question,</v>

202
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.630
the big question is how on earth did the then president of United States hope to

203
00:12:06.631 --> 00:12:10.920
turn all of the Soviet nuclear power and to just a bunch of harmless old bricks?

204
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.900
Well, in order to answer that question, my friends,

205
00:12:12.901 --> 00:12:15.390
I first have to ask you another question.

206
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.980
Does the term star Wars ring a bell and I'm not talking about three great movies

207
00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.420
and six terrible ones

208
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:32.970
On the 23rd of March, 1983, Ronald Reagan introduced the SDI,

209
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.200
the strategic defense initiative, better known as the star Wars initiative.

210
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:41.010
Their goal was to build a system both on earth and in space capable of

211
00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:44.790
dismantling and annihilating, any attempt a Soviet nuclear attack,

212
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:49.650
but wait a minute, this sounds simple, but how exactly do you do it?

213
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.510
The truth is that in spite of everything at the beginning,

214
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.690
there was really no clear idea of how to go about this.

215
00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:01.020
The scientists and experts put forward many different possibilities all the way

216
00:13:01.021 --> 00:13:04.410
from laser weapons installed on the ground or in space to different types of

217
00:13:04.411 --> 00:13:06.240
missiles and tracking systems. However,

218
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.990
later on what they seem to be betting on, because all of this as a top secret,

219
00:13:09.991 --> 00:13:11.940
highly confidential matter was developed.

220
00:13:11.941 --> 00:13:15.690
Small metals launched from space itself, known as brilliant.

221
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.553
<v 0>Pebbles.</v>

222
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.480
<v 1>And this way Reagan's idea was to make the Soviet nuclear military system</v>

223
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:26.400
obsolete by leaving the USSR totally exposed in offensive and defensive matters,

224
00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:30.600
but was Regan bluffing, or does he really think this was all possible? Well,

225
00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:32.580
the truth is that it really doesn't matter all that much.

226
00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:34.860
The point was that the Soviet union believed,

227
00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:38.250
and it seemed to all this STI star Wars stuff,

228
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.040
worried them a lot less than up.

229
00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:46.020
<v 2>The Soviet union believed that the great technological potential of the United</v>

230
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.620
States had scored again and treated Reagan statement as a real threat and a

231
00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:54.030
totally Dobrynin Soviet ambassador to the U S from 1962 to

232
00:13:54.031 --> 00:13:58.470
1986, maybe we should just stop being afraid of SDI.

233
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.170
Of course we can't simply disregard this dangerous program,

234
00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.510
but we should overcome our obsession with it.

235
00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:08.130
They're banking on the USSR fear of SDI in moral economic, political,

236
00:14:08.131 --> 00:14:09.210
and military terms.

237
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:14.190
They're pursuing this program to wear us out orbit in a speech

238
00:14:14.191 --> 00:14:16.770
to the Politburo in March, 1986.

239
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:22.530
<v 1>Here. The truth is that in the Kremlin,</v>

240
00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.860
they were starting to become obsessed with this whole star Wars thing. It went,

241
00:14:25.861 --> 00:14:28.890
I felt like this. I mean, okay, what are you going to just bluffing?

242
00:14:28.891 --> 00:14:32.460
And he does not have the technology at all, but okay. On the other hand,

243
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.520
what if they do have the technology that would be the end of the cold war?

244
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:47.130
So the fact is that the Soviets who were beginning to feel cornered did not

245
00:14:47.131 --> 00:14:51.440
stand idly by, and instead they raised the stakes in 19 seven,

246
00:14:51.441 --> 00:14:54.410
the Soviets launched the military spacecraft Polybius from the back of nor

247
00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:55.100
Cosmodrome.

248
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.370
This spacecraft was equipped with a scaffold laser system and a cast iron

249
00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.150
missile system,

250
00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:03.170
their goal to bring down Reagan's SDI spaceship by putting their own mega weapon

251
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.033
into orbits.

252
00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:11.050
What was the result though? They didn't succeed into putting it into orbit.

253
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:14.650
The ship was shattered in the blink of an eye. And in this way,

254
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.460
the star Wars strategy became an unprecedented bargaining chip for the Reagan

255
00:15:18.461 --> 00:15:19.294
administration.

256
00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.260
<v 0>No probiotic trust, but verify.</v>

257
00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.900
<v 1>No doubt about it. Every time Reagan and Gorbachev sat down,</v>

258
00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:36.640
star Wars always came up at the Geneva bilateral summer of 1985 at the

259
00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:37.070
Razorbacks.

260
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:41.200
I'm like I'm 1986 and the Washington summit of 1987 and the Moscow summit of

261
00:15:41.201 --> 00:15:42.100
1988.

262
00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:47.500
<v 2>The strategic defense initiative in fact proved to be the ultimate bargaining</v>

263
00:15:47.501 --> 00:15:51.700
chip. And we played it for all. It was worth George Schultz,

264
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.100
the U S secretary of state under Ronald Reagan.

265
00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:59.320
<v 1>But then in the 1990s with the collapse of the Soviet union star Wars seemed to</v>

266
00:15:59.321 --> 00:16:02.590
be redundant. And although the program was never formally canceled,

267
00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:06.400
its budget was drastically reduced after the fall of the USSR.

268
00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.870
So then is that it is the cold war over is the concept of space as a

269
00:16:10.871 --> 00:16:14.320
battlefield, dead and buried. Do I never get a laser gun? Well,

270
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:19.210
not at all because there is still much more because you see, in January, 2001,

271
00:16:19.211 --> 00:16:22.840
we would see a new turning point in terms of space policy that month,

272
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:26.410
Donald Rumsfeld, future secretary of defense and the new George W.

273
00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:29.020
Bush administration alerted Congress from an independent commission.

274
00:16:29.021 --> 00:16:31.540
He cheered to a new eminent danger.

275
00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:34.510
The United States was on the verge of a new peril Harbor,

276
00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:38.380
but it was a parallel Harbor and space. Listen to.

277
00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.030
<v 0>The space forces.</v>

278
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.330
<v 1>According to the latest available data from the union of concerned scientists,</v>

279
00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:57.250
United States has at the time of making this video 1,327 operational

280
00:16:57.251 --> 00:17:01.990
satellites and orbits of which approximately 30% belong to the government or the

281
00:17:01.991 --> 00:17:06.100
military, no other country has so many satellites to give you an idea.

282
00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.600
According to existing estimates,

283
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:11.980
Russia has their own 169 and China 363.

284
00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:15.970
And the influence of these American satellites on our daily lives is

285
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.080
astronomical. Get it. There is barely go date, but we don't use one.

286
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:22.270
When you ask for an Uber and it tells you when it has arrived,

287
00:17:22.271 --> 00:17:25.180
when you travel by plane, when you make a transfer through your bank's website,

288
00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:28.780
it's on and on and on. But as you might be able to imagine,

289
00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:32.410
this whole setup is not just to provide conveniences for the civilian world.

290
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:36.400
And the military field satellites have become a key to communications

291
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.670
navigation, reconnaissance metal detection, target setting,

292
00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:44.620
to be clear the Wars of the present and the future are already being fought from

293
00:17:44.621 --> 00:17:45.454
space.

294
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:50.010
<v 0>Thus.</v>

295
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.410
<v 1>As the Rumsfeld commission pointed out in 2001,</v>

296
00:17:52.411 --> 00:17:55.200
when it warned about a potential peril Harbor scenario in space,

297
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:58.260
I would look like a coordinated attack on us, military satellites,

298
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:02.130
which would render the most powerful army on earth blamed and an operative,

299
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.870
how would they control their drones?

300
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.230
How would they know what was happening in a location before they set foot on the

301
00:18:07.231 --> 00:18:09.330
ground? How would the communicate with the trip?

302
00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:13.130
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

303
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.280
<v 1>Basically the same concept of star Wars that once alleviated the fear of the</v>

304
00:18:16.281 --> 00:18:20.570
enemy in times past is today very, very worrying to the North American giant.

305
00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.680
And that fear is not for nothing in recent years, non allied countries,

306
00:18:24.681 --> 00:18:28.640
such as China assured themselves capable of destroying satellites with missiles

307
00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:29.570
without breaking.

308
00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:34.130
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

309
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:37.220
<v 1>Act in 2007 and a demonstration of force by Beijing,</v>

310
00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:40.850
the Chinese giant destroyed one of its own weather satellites, the fan Gwyn,

311
00:18:40.851 --> 00:18:44.390
one seat with a medium range missile, the SC one name,

312
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:47.870
a muscle that although launched without an explosive charge at chief,

313
00:18:47.871 --> 00:18:52.460
the destruction of the satellite by simply colliding with it. And here's a fun.

314
00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.750
And also depressing fact,

315
00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:57.380
this controlled collision generated more than 3000 fragments,

316
00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:00.440
but today orbit the earth in the form of space junk.

317
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:04.610
There are no records of any space event that has generated as much DeBry as this

318
00:19:04.611 --> 00:19:05.300
operation.

319
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.810
And this is important because due to the speed with which they circulate in

320
00:19:08.811 --> 00:19:09.320
space,

321
00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:13.010
even the smallest particles can be very dangerous for functioning satellites,

322
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.600
space stations or rocks.

323
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.793
<v 0>Yes.</v>

324
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.540
<v 1>But it didn't stop there. In 2013,</v>

325
00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:25.160
China launched a new anti-satellite weapon and to space this time much further

326
00:19:25.161 --> 00:19:29.870
away at reach some 18,600 miles a week approaching and

327
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:30.771
space terms,

328
00:19:30.771 --> 00:19:34.820
at least us satellites that were 22,000 miles away from the earth on that

329
00:19:34.821 --> 00:19:38.090
occasion, China claimed that it was just a scientific experiment,

330
00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.830
nothing to be concerned about.

331
00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:44.630
But today we knew that what China did that day was basically a performance

332
00:19:44.631 --> 00:19:48.530
test of its new weapon. The dog coming to a grantor space, myself,

333
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:52.340
or the ability to reach high earth orbits that is placing an object more than

334
00:19:52.341 --> 00:19:53.570
20,000 miles away.

335
00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:00.260
All these events made Rumsfeld's words of warning rezoned in the white house,

336
00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.270
a space parallel Harbor,

337
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:07.190
precisely because of this at the end of 2014 as Douglas lavaro deputy assistant,

338
00:20:07.191 --> 00:20:10.910
secretary of defense for space policy tells us Barack Obama gave the order to

339
00:20:10.911 --> 00:20:14.720
incorporate a lane item into the budget to resume research and this field of

340
00:20:14.721 --> 00:20:15.554
space.

341
00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:16.513
<v 0>Great.</v>

342
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.550
<v 1>My friend's a visual politic at this point. The question is, what about Moscow?</v>

343
00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.480
Did Putin just stand by and watch Zhang pangs China prepare for a possible space

344
00:20:26.481 --> 00:20:29.060
war? No, no, of course not. No, not that's all

345
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.330
In 2017 with Trump already in the white house,

346
00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:38.540
the Russian Federation launched a rocket like pay attention here.

347
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:39.470
And from that rocket,

348
00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:43.820
a satellite came out and from that satellite two more came out and the military

349
00:20:43.821 --> 00:20:47.300
community, this device came to be nicknamed the Russian nesting satellites.

350
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.200
Yeah. Just like those cute little wooden dolls. Well,

351
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:53.560
these satellites began to make maneuvers that allowed them to change orbits with

352
00:20:53.561 --> 00:20:56.740
all the unpredictability and shakiness that, that entails.

353
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.620
And that's not all on a separate occasion.

354
00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.920
Another Russian satellite followed several us and Alex satellites.

355
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.890
Of course you don't have to be Einstein to imagine that if your goal is to be

356
00:21:05.891 --> 00:21:07.150
able to destroy satellites,

357
00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.810
having the technology to carry out that goal is a pretty important step.

358
00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:14.690
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

359
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.070
<v 1>And the land of rock and roll Apple pie and terrible beer.</v>

360
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.110
How have they dealt with all these developments? Well,

361
00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.220
although in the United States,

362
00:21:20.221 --> 00:21:22.890
everything related to space has historically been channeled through the air

363
00:21:22.891 --> 00:21:24.630
force in August of 2019,

364
00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:29.310
Trump reactivated Reagan's former us space command and pay attention because the

365
00:21:29.311 --> 00:21:32.580
reactivation of this division was only the first step later that year,

366
00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:37.170
Trump decreed the creation of the U S S F the United States space force with

367
00:21:37.171 --> 00:21:40.920
fewer than 20,000 men, this new branch of the army dressed by the way,

368
00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:42.180
and camouflage uniform,

369
00:21:42.181 --> 00:21:45.510
because allegedly the personnel comprising the space forces in spite of their

370
00:21:45.511 --> 00:21:47.280
name are on the ground.

371
00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:51.150
It's in charge of chaining in the face of possible adverse scenarios related to

372
00:21:51.151 --> 00:21:55.830
satellites. I don't know. I imagine for example,

373
00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:58.350
a command is about to deploy, to carry out a special mission.

374
00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.131
And at that moment,

375
00:21:59.131 --> 00:22:02.550
the satellite they are communicating with mysteriously fails at that point,

376
00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.570
a division of the U S S F comes into action and would reassign a new satellite

377
00:22:06.571 --> 00:22:09.840
to the command. In addition, if the satellite fails as a result of an attack,

378
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:14.310
they will study how to disable or if necessary destroy the external agents

379
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.610
that said it must be stated that there's currently no clear and agreed upon

380
00:22:20.611 --> 00:22:22.950
version of what the U S S F should be.

381
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.790
It seems that the most accepted version would be of a coast guard Lake style

382
00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:28.830
space force. If you can imagine such a thing,

383
00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.020
responsible for ensuring as much as possible,

384
00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:35.760
a safe space environment for us and allied commercial satellites for their

385
00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:37.620
part throughout all of these developments,

386
00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:40.950
China and Russia have played a strong negotiating Trump card.

387
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.560
If you don't want us to install weapons in space,

388
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:47.400
let's make an agreement that we all sign up to. But on this occasion,

389
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.820
the responsibility United States has been a categorical. No,

390
00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:54.090
the Americans say that they are not sure that they can verify that the agreement

391
00:22:54.091 --> 00:22:56.670
is being fulfilled and that furthermore,

392
00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:01.530
this would not prevent the accumulation of S 80 devices on the ground ready to

393
00:23:01.531 --> 00:23:05.010
be launched into space. But what do you all think if it were up to you,

394
00:23:05.011 --> 00:23:07.290
would you say in such an agreement trusting the other countries,

395
00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:10.080
or would you use all available resources to be the first to achieve

396
00:23:10.081 --> 00:23:14.190
technological superiority and will help me get a laser done?
