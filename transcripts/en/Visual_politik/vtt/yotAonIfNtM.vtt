00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.910
<v 0>Just before we get into the video for today. Let me thank our sponsors.</v>

2
00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:03.744
Skillshare.

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.120
<v 1>Skillshare.</v>

4
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.280
<v 0>Is an online learning community for creators,</v>

5
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.310
with thousands of classes in design business. And more.

6
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.680
We've talked about Skillshare a few times on this channel,

7
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.320
and we've mentioned the various courses and things you can learn on that

8
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:18.750
platform, but maybe you haven't got Skillshare yet.

9
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.830
And therefore you're totally skill less. That's a great shame though,

10
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.560
because there are thousands of classes on Skillshare for you to level up your

11
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:28.980
design business, video, social media, whatever skills,

12
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.640
or just take them from nothing to something. You can do that to

13
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.710
a time when so many important conversations are happening in our world.

14
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.060
Your voice is more essential than ever explore classes to unlock your creativity

15
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.930
for social good here on visual politics, we've taken video production courses,

16
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:47.550
camera courses, YouTube stuff.

17
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.070
We also want to squeeze out as much as possible from our day.

18
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.490
So we watched a course by this guy called Thomas Frank, who is also a YouTuber,

19
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.970
great stuff, and worth checking out if you want to get more done in a day.

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.100
So yeah, Skillshare, just go do it.

21
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.760
You'll like it it's less than $10 a month with an annual subscription supports

22
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.980
visual politic by supporting Skillshare.

23

So you can explore your creativity and I'm pretty sure you'll continue your

26
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:16.830
membership because it is so great. I know let's get cracking.

27
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.463
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

28
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.040
<v 0>Do you remember the dinosaurs in Jurassic park? Well,</v>

29
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.290
it is likely that in the year 2025,

30
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.980
you'll be able to visit them in person and Saudi Arabia. And no,

31
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.470
I haven't gone crazy and what's more surprising.

32
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.280
This is one of their brilliant strategies to save them from the brink of ruin.

33
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.580
That's right. When we think of Saudi Arabia, we think of millionaire, sheikhs,

34
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.361
skyscrapers,

35
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:47.630
and the most extravagant luxuries oil has turned this country into one of the

36
00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:48.464
world's greatest.

37
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.240
However, Saudi Arabia is actually getting closer to economic collapse,

38
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.250
and I say collapse with a capital C Saudi Arabia could become the next Greece

39
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.900
before this decade is out.

40
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.770
Those of you who are veteran followers of visual politic already know why we

41
00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:08.900
have been covering the crisis in Saudi Arabia.

42
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.843
<v 1>Years.</v>

43
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.550
<v 0>Basically almost the entire economy of this country depends on dinosaur juice.</v>

44
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.020
Crude oil represents almost 90% of this country's exports.

45
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.990
And if there's one product that's been affected by the Corona virus.

46
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.600
<v 1>Oil prices.</v>

47
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.860
<v 0>Have collapsed. And as the price of a barrel of oil drops,</v>

48
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.630
all of their income drops.

49
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.170
We're talking about a country that has been used to living in an economic utopia

50
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.240
for decades to give you an idea,

51
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.800
almost all Saudi citizens work for the state and conditions unthinkable

52
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.190
elsewhere on the planet. They barely pay any taxes.

53
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.320
I receive a lot of state funded days.

54
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.020
<v 1>But those days.</v>

55
00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.940
<v 0>Are over and now they need diversify their economy.</v>

56
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.250
<v 1>And this.</v>

57
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.910
<v 0>Is where all those great projects you have heard about common mega cities in the</v>

58
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:10.240
middle of the desert, a Jurassic park flying cabs,

59
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.450
and even even an artificial moon.

60
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.470
So my friend's a visual politic Saudi Arabia is rebuilding itself from top to

61
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:20.110
bottom and it's doing so in a desperate measure to avoid it.

62
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.060
<v 1>In between.</v>

63
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.780
<v 0>No are ridiculous investments and to capital, a lot of killing.</v>

64
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.220
And that is what I said. So the question that we're asking today as well,

65
00:03:32.221 --> 00:03:35.580
the mega cities really save this country from economic ruin.

66
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.630
Why does Saudi Arabia want to put dinosaurs in the metal of the desert?

67
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.090
Will they really be able to carry out such measure projects?

68
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.110
And did I really say an artificial moon today?

69
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.880
We are going to answer all of these questions,

70
00:03:47.881 --> 00:03:49.380
but first let's look a little history.

71
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.990
The Mirage of the petrodollar in 2017 Mohammed bin Salman was appointed

72
00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.153
crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.

73
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.680
One of the first things he did, as soon as he came to power,

74
00:04:04.681 --> 00:04:08.070
it was to gather all the political and economic elites of the country and lock

75
00:04:08.071 --> 00:04:10.830
them up in a luxury suite at the Ritz hotel in regia.

76
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.650
And they were all accused of corruption. Since then,

77
00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:17.220
Ben Selman has been defacto, the absolute leader of Saudi Arabia,

78
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.400
and he has a very clear mission to modernize and diversify.

79
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.600
His country's economy.

80
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.340
Time is running out and Saudi Arabia needs to produce something other than the

81
00:04:29.341 --> 00:04:31.080
sweet, sweet, dinosaur juice.

82
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.220
The big question is what is it really possible to create competitive companies

83
00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.350
in this country? Well, the truth is that it's almost impossible. Yes, it's true.

84
00:04:40.351 --> 00:04:44.310
The Saudi population is very young. 40% are under 25 years old.

85
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.150
Many of these young people could be the next Elon Musk or the Mark Zuckerberg of

86
00:04:48.151 --> 00:04:51.270
the future. In fact, many of them have studied at Univerisity.

87
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.590
So what's the problem. Well,

88
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.120
only 20% of Saudi Arabian university students have studied technical careers.

89
00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.150
Most Saudi students choose degrees such as theology,

90
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.160
Arabic studies or Arabic literature.

91
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.200
As you can imagine with that kind of training,

92
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.070
it is difficult to set up a rival to Facebook. In fact,

93
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.180
most private companies and Saudi Arabia avoid hiring Saudi citizens.

94
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.480
To give you an idea of the Saudi workforce.

95
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.020
35% are immigrants working in the oil or construction sector.

96
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.980
38% are civil servants and 15% are unemployment.

97
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.490
Only 12% of Saudi citizens work outside the state.

98
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.320
And yet you did hear that correctly.

99
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.270
38% of the workforce works for the state as a comparison France,

100
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.740
which is also a country that supports a huge state has only 24%.

101
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.350
Mondu all this means two things.

102
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.200
The first is that it's very difficult to get new companies started.

103
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.410
The second is that at the time when the Saudi state has stopped hiring more

104
00:05:49.411 --> 00:05:51.630
officials, unemployment levels have scaled.

105
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.463
<v 1>I rocketed</v>

106
00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.160
this 2020.

107
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.220
<v 0>Youth. Unemployment is at 65%.</v>

108
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.040
So vision 2030 is really been Selma.

109
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.110
Ann's desperate plan to modernize the company.

110
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.810
<v 1>Part of this.</v>

111
00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:11.643
<v 0>Consists of a</v>

112
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.870
$445 billion sovereign wealth fund that invests in companies. For example,

113
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.130
Saudi Arabia has invested in companies such as Boeing, Facebook, and Disney,

114
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.850
but if you really want to modernize your country, you need much, much more than,

115
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.570
And since there were hardly any economic sectors beyond oil,

116
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.130
Ben Solman has decided to create them from scratch with mega projects.

117
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.720
So far, Saudi Arabia has Mecca, which is the religious capital of Islam.

118
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.620
Ben Salmond's plan is to build new MCAS, but not religious ones,

119
00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.700
economic ones, the Mecca of tourism, the Mecca of biotechnology,

120
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.380
the Mecca of green energies.

121
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.860
We are talking about whole cities built from scratch cities that would make

122
00:06:56.861 --> 00:06:59.260
those new Chinese metropolises that we have told you about.

123
00:06:59.261 --> 00:07:02.350
So many times on visual politic look like backward village.

124
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:07.150
For example, on the red sea coast,

125
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.890
they hope to finish five artificial islands by 2022 and 16 luxury

126
00:07:11.891 --> 00:07:14.980
hotels on the outskirts of radio, they are building cornea,

127
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.770
which aspires to be the capital of healthy leisure. In other words,

128
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.940
I kind of Las Vegas,

129
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.530
but with like casinos alcohol and without Elvis impersonators. So in my opinion,

130
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:24.423
Las Vegas,

131
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.810
without any fun with all this Saudi Arabia wants to copy the example of Dubai,

132
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.700
but to the extreme, however, the real jewel and the crone is the city of neon.

133
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.190
We're going to talk about this later and you're going to have to hold onto your

134
00:07:36.191 --> 00:07:40.300
chair because I guarantee you've never seen anything like it in your life.

135
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:41.920
And I know what you're thinking now. Okay.

136
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.580
So now he's going to say the Corona virus has ruined all these projects, right?

137
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.080
Well, I'm sorry to tell you.

138
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.393
<v 1>That you're wrong.</v>

139
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.100
Clean austerity and Megalodon.

140
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.800
<v 0>Mania Lake, almost every country in the world.</v>

141
00:07:56.801 --> 00:08:00.400
Saudi Arabia has had to pull out a Corona rescue for all the small businesses.

142
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.410
I've had to close down during a lockdown.

143
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:06.610
We're talking about more than $32 billion that have triggered debt levels.

144
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:08.440
And this explains news headlines.

145
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:16.000
<v 1>Kingdom of Saudi Arabia VAT rate to increase to 15% from the</v>

146
00:08:16.001 --> 00:08:18.100
1st of July, 2020 Deloitte.

147
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:22.030
<v 0>I know what you might be thinking, no, a goods and services tax a 15%.</v>

148
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.950
That's no big deal, but it is.

149
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:28.330
If we take into account that it used to be only 5% and before 2018

150
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.940
Saudi Arabia didn't even charge it. In other words,

151
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.960
the government has been forced to triple this tax overnight. And of course,

152
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:38.410
they also have to cut all the aid they gave to several sevens. However,

153
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.570
it is one thing to talk about current spending,

154
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.710
where they have made cuts is quite a different story when it comes to investment

155
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.510
with or without the Corona virus,

156
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.630
Saudi Arabia needs to start producing more than just oil.

157
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:53.380
And one of the sectors that is betting on is real estate and part of Benz

158
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:58.350
Elman's vision 2030 goal is that 70% of Saudis will order home by 2030.

159
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.590
All of this indicates that the government is building new residential areas.

160
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.193
<v 1>Everywhere.</v>

161
00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.700
<v 0>It's the case. For example, of sauteing murkier,</v>

162
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.000
a macro urbanization financed by the Saudi and Chinese governments.

163
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.700
The first phase is almost 6,000 new homes.

164
00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.790
And 90% of them have already been sold.

165
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.260
They gave me beyond luxury housing, artificial rivers, and many, many mosques.

166
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.720
These are just residential areas, projects,

167
00:09:26.721 --> 00:09:28.700
to some extent that are a bit average.

168
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.540
At least if we compare them to the jewel and the crone,

169
00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.610
Ben Salmond's personal pet project,

170
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.180
what could easily be called the most ambitious project in the history of

171
00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:43.340
mankind, check this out.

172
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.350
<v 1>The city of the future.</v>

173
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:52.310
<v 0>Let me present to you. The city of neon. It does not exist yet,</v>

174
00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.680
but supposedly in the year 2030,

175
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.260
the whole world will Marvel at the biggest city in the world,

176
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.540
built from scratch and the metal of the desert.

177
00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:02.930
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

178
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.960
<v 0>We're talking about a city of 26,000 square kilometers,</v>

179
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:09.140
but we'll make it 33 times bigger than New York city.

180
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:13.790
Imagine the whole territory that Belgium or Maryland occupies covered entirely

181
00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:14.800
with skyscrapers,

182
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.750
New Alma aspires to be the Mecca of tourism technology biotechnology,

183
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:21.763
and a lot more.

184
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.520
And all of this with zero two emissions into the atmosphere and ecological

185
00:10:25.521 --> 00:10:28.730
environmentally friendly synergistic, and 2.0 city,

186
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.910
by the way is curious that the country of oil and fossil fuels they know,

187
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.630
want to make a city free of CO2 emissions. But that is another story.

188
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:38.660
And you're probably thinking why, who would think the building,

189
00:10:38.661 --> 00:10:42.290
the largest city in the world in the middle of the desert would be a good idea.

190
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:44.960
Well, as strange as it sounds in principle,

191
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.380
it could make economic sense to prove it, take a look at it.

192
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:53.720
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

193
00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.330
<v 0>We'll look at it. New home is located on the red sea coast,</v>

194
00:10:56.331 --> 00:10:59.420
which is where 20% of the world's Meritain traffic passes through.

195
00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.970
It could easily be a logistics hub and addition.

196
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.890
It would be the ultimate tax Haven.

197
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.430
They could even consider greeting a Zune without taxes of Annie Kane,

198
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:08.810
a special economic zone,

199
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:12.890
independent of the government of Saudi Arabia and managed directly by Mohammed

200
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.330
To all this we add to the country itself would finance the first wave of

201
00:11:20.331 --> 00:11:24.050
construction. We have a good place to invest, and you're probably thinking, uh,

202
00:11:24.051 --> 00:11:25.430
no one lives on that land.

203
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:29.060
Can they really start building there without having to buy the land first? Well,

204
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.000
the truth is that it is a practically unpopulated area.

205
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:35.480
The only inhabitants of that region are a pneumatic trade. The Al who waited.

206
00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:37.730
But remember, we are talking about Saudi Arabia,

207
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.110
a country where human rights are best optional, preventing Selman,

208
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.420
displacing all these new mines is as simple as saying,

209
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.570
get out of here or I will send in the army,

210
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.190
But just how ambitious as this project. Well, at least on paper,

211
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.060
the idea for the new home is to have a Jurassic park with robotic dinosaurs,

212
00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:58.923
but that's not all,

213
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:02.830
they've also said that they're going to have an artificial moon.

214
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.120
So yet I did see that. So why do they need an artificial moon?

215
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:11.170
You might ask what return on investment and an artificial moon give you well,

216
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.680
I honestly don't know, but Ben Solomon has said he wants an artificial moon.

217
00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.670
So he gets an artificial moon. And what about the beaches? Well,

218
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.700
you see the beaches themselves are already beautiful.

219
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:26.050
We all love to see the sea and the waves, but what if we could make the waves.

220
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:27.443
<v 1>Shame.</v>

221
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:36.060
<v 0>Neon will also have waves that glow in the dark. It may seem incredible to you,</v>

222
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:39.240
but it is in fact possible to make the sea glow in the dark,

223
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.040
which is a sentence I honestly never thought.

224
00:12:41.041 --> 00:12:45.090
I'd say apparently there was a type of unicellular algae that when it reproduces

225
00:12:45.091 --> 00:12:48.420
without control generates a toxin that glows in the dark,

226
00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:49.560
have you searched on the internet,

227
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:52.440
you can find incredible images in Taiwan or California,

228
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.230
where they have suffered plagues of bioluminescence of this canine.

229
00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.410
This is a spectacular phenomenon, but at the same time,

230
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:03.540
our real problem as the name indicates this toxin that glows in the dark is

231
00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:07.320
toxic. That is, it kills all the flora and fauna in the water.

232
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:10.530
And I'm not sure how this fits in with the idea of making a completely green and

233
00:13:10.531 --> 00:13:15.330
environmentally friendly city, but who is going to argue with Ben Sellman?

234
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.670
And you're probably thinking, no, well, what about the roots?

235
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.220
What are they going to do with the cars to prevent them from polluting the

236
00:13:20.221 --> 00:13:24.600
atmosphere? Well, don't worry, but in Selma has thought of that painting.

237
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.910
<v 1>I don't want pavements in roads. In 2030,</v>

238
00:13:29.911 --> 00:13:34.200
we will have flying taxis quote, attributed to Muhammad bin Salmaan.

239
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.220
<v 0>This is just a taste of everything they want to do for the city.</v>

240
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.190
The schools we'll have teachers who teach through holograms.

241
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.850
The streets will be cleaned by robots and there will even be cameras on every

242
00:13:44.851 --> 00:13:48.480
corner, monitoring the citizens to give you an idea.

243
00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:52.560
The concept of neon is to create a model of what human life and the future will

244
00:13:52.561 --> 00:13:56.790
be. And Ben Solomon is more than ready to make that model, whatever.

245
00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:57.713
<v 1>It takes.</v>

246
00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.280
<v 0>At the time of making this video,</v>

247
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:05.280
Niamh already had an airport built and running.

248
00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.790
They have just built a water desalination plant with the capacity to process

249
00:14:08.791 --> 00:14:11.430
50,000 cubic meters of water per day.

250
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.310
And despite the austerity brought on by the Corona virus,

251
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.690
Saudi Arabia has already seen a lot of contracts with construction companies

252
00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:22.080
between March and September of this year. But the question,

253
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.780
the big question that you'll all be asking is,

254
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:28.860
is it really fair to call it a Jurassic park? If the dinosaurs are animatronic?

255
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:29.910
I'm kidding. Of course.

256
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.450
The question you're wondering is how much is this monstrosity going to cost?

257
00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.480
Well, remember I told you to hold onto your chairs, do that. No,

258
00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.590
because the budget to build the home from scratch as $500 billion,

259
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.480
$500 billion, that's the equivalent of Belgium's entire GDP. As you can imagine,

260
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:48.720
Ben Solomon's idea is not to finance this all from his own pocket.

261
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.440
Heaven's new Saudi Arabia takes the first step,

262
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:55.130
but the rest of that money should come from international investors at the end

263
00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:55.964
of the day,

264
00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:01.310
who wouldn't want to invest in such a promising project. Well,

265
00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:03.590
right now we're going to look at labs.

266
00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.350
<v 1>Selling is bad for business.</v>

267
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:12.970
<v 0>As strange as it sounds when Ben Salmaan a nose to the neon project in 2017,</v>

268
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.330
many people said they would join in and we're not just talking about any

269
00:15:16.331 --> 00:15:21.130
millionaires. Richard Branson said he wanted to invest in Norman foster.

270
00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.570
One of the world's most famous architects also said he wanted to build the

271
00:15:25.571 --> 00:15:30.130
city's first skyscrapers in the end, as crazy as this idea science,

272
00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:32.350
it is still a very inspiring project,

273
00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:36.370
especially if you're a Richard Brunson or Norman foster type who wouldn't want

274
00:15:36.371 --> 00:15:39.580
to be the first to build a city with artificial cabs, dinosaurs.

275
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.410
And I see again, an artificial Mooney. So yeah, back in 2017,

276
00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.170
Naomi seemed like a good idea, but in 2018,

277
00:15:47.171 --> 00:15:50.350
something happened that changed the perception of the project forever.

278
00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:58.300
<v 1>The CIA concludes Saudi crown Prince ordered Jamal Khashoggi, his assassination,</v>

279
00:15:58.330 --> 00:15:59.350
Washington post.

280
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.510
<v 0>Oh, the start of this video. I already told you that Ben,</v>

281
00:16:01.511 --> 00:16:05.890
some man had no qualms at all about putting the entire political elite of Saudi

282
00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:10.060
Arabia in prison. Although that prison was a luxury hotel, what's more in 2017,

283
00:16:10.061 --> 00:16:12.730
Ben Selman kidnapped the Lebanese prime minister.

284
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.730
We've covered the field story and another visual politics video in case you're

285
00:16:15.731 --> 00:16:17.710
interested. And after all, why wouldn't you be?

286
00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.810
But this is already on another level.

287
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:23.740
Homolka Shogi was a wall street journal journalist who was very critical of Ben

288
00:16:23.741 --> 00:16:24.574
Selma.

289
00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:30.760
One day he entered the Saudi embassy and Turkey and he came out,

290
00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.060
cut up in little pieces in plastic bags.

291
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.200
Ben Solman literally ordered him to be killed and quartered.

292
00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:39.160
As you can imagine,

293
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.530
anyone who may have been interested in doing business with Ben,

294
00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.530
Suleman abandoned the idea at that point,

295
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.970
it was no longer a question of ethics, but pure survival.

296
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.550
Would you really dare to have a business meeting with Ben MUN,

297
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:55.180
knowing that you could be killed at any moment? In fact,

298
00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:59.500
Ben Salmaan himself seems to have understood that this event doomed his project.

299
00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:02.170
This is what he said in 2018.

300
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.820
<v 1>No one will invest in the neon project for years,</v>

301
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.133
Mohammed bin Salmaan.

302
00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.890
<v 0>I imagined him saying that crying while washing the blood off of his hands.</v>

303
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:15.940
And now I ask you,

304
00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:19.300
what would you do if all your potential investors turned their backs on you

305
00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:21.610
because they were afraid you were going to kill them.

306
00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.040
Maybe a good idea would be, I don't know,

307
00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:26.350
to stop killing all the people around you,

308
00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:30.190
but instead when cell mines decided to call cause Shockey's relatives to have an

309
00:17:30.191 --> 00:17:31.660
official photo taken.

310
00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.493
<v 1>With them.</v>

311
00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:38.890
<v 0>He then for Bates Shuggie son to leave Saudi Arabia and Ben Salmond's personal</v>

312
00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:43.060
killers, the so-called Teicher squad continued to threaten all study activists,

313
00:17:43.061 --> 00:17:45.700
living abroad. Meanwhile, in order to clean up his image,

314
00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:50.100
Ben Salmaan has dedicated himself to organizing sporting events in neon.

315
00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:55.820
The city is not yet built and does not have any stadiums instead of big soccer

316
00:17:55.821 --> 00:18:00.200
competitions. They have organized extreme sports events, wakeboarding,

317
00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.870
paragliding, wingsuit flying. And not only that,

318
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.030
remember that new home is the city of the future.

319
00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:09.380
And what is the sport of the future? Exactly killing activists. No,

320
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:10.483
I'm kidding.

321
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:17.540
<v 1>[Inaudible] signs MOU to become global E gaming hub Arabian</v>

322
00:18:17.541 --> 00:18:18.374
business.

323
00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.980
<v 0>You may have heard in 2019 Ben Salmaan St.</v>

324
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:24.860
A contract to sponsor world cup events of e-sports such as Dota two and league

325
00:18:24.861 --> 00:18:27.790
of legends. And that does sort of fit with gamers like myself,

326
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.150
image of the world. I mean, yes,

327
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:32.210
he might be quashing political distance and murdering people, but at least,

328
00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.970
at least he's not charging for microtransactions. However,

329
00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.760
this ingenious plan has not turned out as he thought,

330
00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:41.330
do you remember that trade that lives or rather use to live on the land where

331
00:18:41.331 --> 00:18:42.590
the city of neon will be?

332
00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.890
That's the Al who wait out to trade and many members of this trade do not want

333
00:18:45.891 --> 00:18:46.520
to leave the land.

334
00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.490
They have lived on for centuries for the construction of the project.

335
00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:53.780
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

336
00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:55.220
<v 0>In other countries. When these things happen,</v>

337
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:58.490
there are lawsuits and governments compensate the owners with large sums of

338
00:18:58.491 --> 00:19:02.060
money. This is something called private property. However,

339
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:05.720
private property in Saudi Arabia is like human rights.

340
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.600
And that it is very much an optional, extra.

341
00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.950
<v 1>[Inaudible] forces kill man,</v>

342
00:19:12.951 --> 00:19:17.840
who refused to give up property Abdul Rakeem all hot tea was allegedly shot

343
00:19:17.841 --> 00:19:22.340
dead. After he refused to give up his property for a red sea mega project.

344
00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:23.210
I'll just.

345
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:24.020
<v 0>Meanwhile,</v>

346
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.110
many activists from this tribe living in other parts of the world say that they

347
00:19:27.111 --> 00:19:31.460
are receiving death threats of all canes. The tiger squad sends the messages.

348
00:19:31.461 --> 00:19:34.580
Like don't think that because you live in London, you are safe.

349
00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:38.390
And this explains why these e-sports have also abandoned. Ben Salma,

350
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.960
even gaming companies can only take so much. In this case.

351
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:46.100
It was the LEC workers themselves that is European league of legends tournament,

352
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.080
who went on strike to force riot games,

353
00:19:48.081 --> 00:19:51.650
to cancel all contracts with Saudi Arabia. And of course,

354
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.670
riot games listened to them. So see, gamers rise up.

355
00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:02.240
<v 1>This point. There were some problematic sponsors shell and Kit-Kat for example,</v>

356
00:20:02.241 --> 00:20:03.410
but this was a different level.

357
00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:08.180
This is a project to build a mega city directly overseen by a despotic leader of

358
00:20:08.181 --> 00:20:10.130
a country that murders journalists.

359
00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:14.210
I think that was the breaking point for a lot of people, Devin, pure technics,

360
00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.240
young league of legends. E-sport commentator.

361
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:22.160
<v 0>Two posts by now the message from the whole world to Ben Selman is pretty clear.</v>

362
00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.520
Stop killing people. It may seem like stating the obvious.

363
00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:29.210
You may even think that it is so obvious that is some store of black comedy,

364
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.310
but the truth is that for Ben Solman,

365
00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:36.290
this is apparently far from obvious and this situation where the whole world

366
00:20:36.291 --> 00:20:39.770
is turning its back on him. Ben Suleman is not thinking of stopping,

367
00:20:39.771 --> 00:20:42.650
killing people far from it. At the time of making this video,

368
00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.040
at least there was no announcement that Saudi Arabia is going to cancel that

369
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:49.000
tiger squad or that they are considering ending.

370
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:53.260
The killing the opposite in fact is true after these murders and all these

371
00:20:53.261 --> 00:20:56.770
canceled contracts, Ben Selman is trying a different strategy.

372
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.660
Hiring communications agency

373
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.450
and June,

374
00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:09.010
2020 Saudi Arabia announced contracts worth $3 million with two international PR

375
00:21:09.011 --> 00:21:12.400
agencies versus Kuhn and Wolf and render Finn, frankly,

376
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.830
no matter how many communications campaigns you do,

377
00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:18.820
I doubt very much that murders can be whitewashed,

378
00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.950
but apart from human rights violations,

379
00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:23.920
Saudi Arabia is still stuck with the same economic problem.

380
00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:24.970
Think about it for a month.

381
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:32.320
Then someone is on the ropes. On the one hand,

382
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.180
he needs to get this project off the ground,

383
00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:38.110
no matter what his whole public image is linked to New York, his success,

384
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:42.550
all Saudi Arabia is diversification plans are linked to neon success as are all

385
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.850
of the mega projects. And without the support of foreign investors,

386
00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:48.220
it is difficult to think that he can carry them out.

387
00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:52.450
And the financial treks he has been using so far are not exactly helping him in

388
00:21:52.451 --> 00:21:56.050
this case. For example,

389
00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:00.370
fluting Aramco on the stock market gave him 26.6 billion,

390
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.940
but that money that came almost entirely from Saudi citizens,

391
00:22:03.941 --> 00:22:08.290
themselves who bought shares after virtually being forced to by the government.

392
00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.530
The objective of that operation was to get money from outside the country.

393
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:15.910
And in that sense, our I'm cause IPU was an absolute failure. No,

394
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:20.110
it doesn't need 26 billion, but 500 billion.

395
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:25.870
So the burning questions are well.

396
00:22:25.871 --> 00:22:29.680
We really get to see a Jurassic park in Saudi Arabia and I'd argue, Nope,

397
00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:32.980
because they're animatronic dinosaurs, not real dinosaurs. Watch the movie.

398
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:35.260
It's pretty clear. Do you really think this mega project,

399
00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:39.430
this neon mega city is a good investment or will it be the ultimate ruin of

400
00:22:39.431 --> 00:22:42.370
Saudi Arabia? And what would you do most importantly,

401
00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.380
