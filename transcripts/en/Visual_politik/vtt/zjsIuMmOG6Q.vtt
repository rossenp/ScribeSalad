00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.910
<v 1>Friends Arizona is a state famous for the grand Canyon,</v>

2
00:00:05.911 --> 00:00:09.510
copper mines and cactuses. If there's one thing that is scarce in this state,

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.410
it is rain. However,

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.550
having a semi desert climate has not prevented Arizona from being the state with

5
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:17.760
the fastest growing population in the entire United States,

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.880
to give you an idea twice, as many people lived in Arizona today,

7
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.180
as 30 years ago, they just passed the 7 million Mark. In fact,

8
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.110
it is very striking to see how fairly similar neighboring States like Nevada,

9
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.340
New Mexico, and even Utah, each have less than half the population of Arizona.

10
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:35.340
And you might be asking yourself, so what on earth is going on? Well,

11
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.990
it seems that the answer is obvious.

12
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.000
Demographics offer little doubts today.

13
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.890
30% of Arizona's population is of Hispanic origin compared to only 19%,

14
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.753
30 years ago.

15
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.300
And take notes because the influence of the Hispanic population is only going to

16
00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:54.080
keep growing.

17
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.370
Since 2017 births to Latino mothers are higher than those of any other group.

18
00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.630
And of course, over the years,

19
00:00:59.631 --> 00:01:03.410
all this will have an effect on Arizona's electorate people under 18,

20
00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:07.280
can't vote this time around, but it's only a matter of time before they can.

21
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.330
That's why a report from Arizona state university estimates that the Hispanic

22
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.250
proportion of the electorate will grow from 15% in 2010 to 25% by

23
00:01:16.251 --> 00:01:19.880
2030. So difference visual politics. The conclusion is simple.

24
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.080
Arizona state fair helped Donald Trump to reach the white house in 2016 is

25
00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:26.720
becoming increasingly Hispanic. In this video,

26
00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:30.530
we will examine how all this could implement the presidential elections next

27
00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:33.350
Tuesday, 3rd of November and future elections. Yeah.

28
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.423
<v 0>Stop it.</v>

29
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.260
<v 1>Friends.</v>

30
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.340
Arizona has historically been a Republican stronghold since the end of world war

31
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.820
II and the victory of Democrat Harry Truman in 1948.

32
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.450
Arizona has supported the Republican party's presidential candidates except in

33
00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:03.500
1996. And on that occasion, bill Clinton won by a landslide. However,

34
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.600
now it seems that all this could be about to change.

35
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.350
<v 0>Widen leads by eight points in Arizona over time.</v>

36
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.430
<v 1>The importance of Arizona is considerable, especially for president Trump,</v>

37
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.810
but why? Well, basically,

38
00:02:14.811 --> 00:02:18.050
because it's quite clear that Trump's chances of staying in the white house,

39
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:21.470
depend on maintaining the support he received in 2016.

40
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.510
The same is also true for the Democrats.

41
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.900
It is actually more important for Biden to win now in Arizona,

42
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.110
which means 11 votes in the electoral college. Then for Clinton,

43
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.060
when he did it in 1996,

44
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.670
and there were only eight votes or in Harry Truman's time.

45
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:35.803
<v 0>There were only four.</v>

46
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.450
<v 1>Arizona is no longer a Republican stronghold could become a major headache for</v>

47
00:02:44.451 --> 00:02:47.930
Republicans for years to come because it's importance in the electoral college

48
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.793
is growing.

49
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.560
That's why Arizona is so important. In 2020,

50
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.840
we are talking about the 11 electoral seats that one candidate wins and the 11th

51
00:02:58.841 --> 00:03:01.030
that the other candidate fails to win. Four years ago,

52
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.740
77 electoral college votes separated Trump and Clinton and of those 77 Arizona

53
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:09.190
alone would represent 22 votes. Doesn't seem so few now does it.

54
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:13.540
So the question is could Arizona stop being a guaranteed red state and become a

55
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:14.350
swing state?

56
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.380
What makes us think that the people of this state are going to vote for Biden or

57
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:18.550
why they might stay with Trump?

58
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.480
Will Arizona be the state that decides in November who will occupy the white

59
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:25.210
house for the next four years today on visual politic,

60
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.720
we will answer all these questions, but first let's take a look at some history.

61
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.880
<v 0>Former sheriff of Maricopa.</v>

62
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.540
<v 1>Maricopa County is one of 15 counties in Arizona. It is home to Phoenix,</v>

63
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.580
the state's Capitol and most popular city.

64
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.220
And I assure you that we are not exaggerating one bit.

65
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.630
If we say that for many years,

66
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.050
the only news that reach us from here was that concerning Joe Arpaio,

67
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.060
the former sheriff of.

68
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.993
<v 0>Maricopa.</v>

69
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.990
<v 1>Joe Arpaio was elected sheriff of Maricopa County in 1993,</v>

70
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.130
when he was 60 years old, he remained in office for 24 years until 2017,

71
00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:11.070
having been reelected up to five times a sheriff,

72
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.590
he was always the Republican party backed candidate.

73
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.370
And he proclaimed himself as the toughest sheriff in the entire USA.

74
00:04:17.371 --> 00:04:21.060
His fame even reached an international level because of his harsh treatment of

75
00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:23.100
prisoners and his persecution of elite.

76
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.173
<v 0>Immigrants.</v>

77
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.960
<v 1>The biggest controversies was the tent city jail.</v>

78
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.030
You see before our pal became sheriff,

79
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.320
the number of inmates in Arizona exceeded the maximum allowed in the existing

80
00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:38.100
facilities.

81
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.280
So many inmates were released before they served their time in order to comply

82
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.320
with the rules and to avoid overcrowding.

83
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.570
But our power came up with a solution tents,

84
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.670
A prison made up of tents and watched over from century boxes from which was

85
00:04:53.671 --> 00:04:55.620
hung, a message that read free rooms.

86
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.530
This is how Arizona's prison policy suddenly changed.

87
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.980
All prisoners were sentenced to serve their full sentences because in the end,

88
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.370
if more space was needed, sheriff Arpaio would simply just put up more tense.

89
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.700
Of course the conditions were not exactly the best setting up a campsite in

90
00:05:08.701 --> 00:05:10.500
Arizona. Doesn't seem like a great idea.

91
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.480
Look at this news from just three years ago.

92
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.100
<v 0>Arizona is housing prisoners in a tent city and is 117 degrees.</v>

93
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.880
<v 1>That's 47 degrees Celsius, Celsius.</v>

94
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.010
If our power wanted his prison to resemble hell,

95
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.660
he clearly wasn't liking the heat.

96
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.740
Then there are other details that attracted the attention of the media all over

97
00:05:28.741 --> 00:05:29.370
the world.

98
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.300
The prisoners generally convicted of minor crimes were forced to wear pink

99
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.900
underwear and black and white striped suits. The classic costume of a prisoner,

100
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.860
all that was missing,

101
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.340
where the shackles and the ball and trained direct by foot to complete the look

102
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.150
of course human rights organizations denounced the denigrating treatment of

103
00:05:45.151 --> 00:05:45.601
prisoners.

104
00:05:45.601 --> 00:05:49.110
But the point is that deep down our power was delighted to receive such

105
00:05:49.111 --> 00:05:52.380
attention. Of course, in the long run. So much attention creates problems.

106
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.790
And boy has our power.

107
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.730
<v 0>To share raids.</v>

108
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.660
<v 1>By the sheriffs to search for illegal immigrants led to accusations of racial</v>

109
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:06.740
profiling. For years, a federal judge reached that conclusion in 2011,

110
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.010
he ordered our power to end his immigration roundups because they were detaining

111
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:12.440
people without evidence of having committed any crime.

112
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.020
The veteran sheriff ignore the order. And in 2017,

113
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.820
he was convicted of criminal contempt.

114
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.720
Our Powell was facing a possible sentence of up to six months in prison,

115
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.810
but he has very powerful friends in the 2016 elections.

116
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:26.810
He showed full support for Donald Trump's presidential candidacy.

117
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.960
So when he was convicted, the president came to his aid and pardoned him.

118
00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.680
<v 2>Sheriff Joe is a Patriot. Sheriff. Joe loves our country.</v>

119
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.480
Sheriff Joe protected our borders and sheriff Joe was very

120
00:06:40.481 --> 00:06:43.060
unfairly treated by the Obama administration,

121
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.650
especially right before an election, an election that he would have won. So,

122
00:06:47.651 --> 00:06:52.630
and he was elected many times. So I stand by my pardon of sheriff, Joe.

123
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:57.370
And I think the people of Arizona who really know him best would agree with

124
00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.353
that.

125
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.380
<v 1>It was Trump's first pardon and did not meet with the approval of many</v>

126
00:07:02.381 --> 00:07:06.070
Republicans nor with the man who had held the office of Arizona Senator for

127
00:07:06.071 --> 00:07:08.110
three decades. The late John McCain.

128
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.660
<v 3>Mr. Arpayo was found guilty of criminal contempt for continuing to</v>

129
00:07:13.661 --> 00:07:16.930
illegally profile Latinos, living in Arizona,

130
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.070
based on their perceived immigration status in violation of a judge's order.

131
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.030
The president has the authority to make this pardon, but doing so at this time,

132
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.570
undermines his claim for the respect of ruling law.

133
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.980
As Mr Arpayo has shown no remorse for his actions, John McCain.

134
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:33.371
<v 1>Well,</v>

135
00:07:33.371 --> 00:07:37.030
this was the Arizona that supported Trump to become president back in 2016,

136
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.170
Maricopa County,

137
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.830
whose voters reelected our power multiple times recognized in the mogul,

138
00:07:41.831 --> 00:07:44.620
the same anti-immigrant rhetoric and policy proposals.

139
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.470
He had already heard from the former sheriff there. Having said that,

140
00:07:47.471 --> 00:07:50.140
let's see what Arizona has been like during the Trump era.

141
00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:02.380
<v 0>The president's great wall in 2050.</v>

142
00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.420
<v 1>15, Trump launched his race for the white house.</v>

143
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:06.850
He soon made clear his views on Mexican immigration.

144
00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:11.710
<v 2>And they're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those</v>

145
00:08:11.711 --> 00:08:14.530
problems with us. They're bringing drugs,

146
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.410
they're bringing crime they're rapists.

147
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.790
And some I assume are good people. Donald Trump.

148
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.480
<v 1>Sturman office has grammatically reformed the U S immigration system since</v>

149
00:08:25.481 --> 00:08:26.140
taking office.

150
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:30.520
His administration has taken more than 400 executive actions on immigration.

151
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.880
So did Trump keep the promises he made four years ago to win over the voters?

152
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:37.510
Did he deliver on rhetoric that many might dismiss as populist? Well,

153
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.120
it might seem that no, he didn't not at all.

154
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.430
You see the promise to build a wall along the us Mexico border was one of Donald

155
00:08:45.431 --> 00:08:47.560
Trump's most controversial campaign promises.

156
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:51.760
The magnates spoke of a 1,600 kilometer concrete wall with the rest of the

157
00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:53.590
border secured by natural barriers.

158
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.360
What's more Trump also insisted that Mexico would pay for it and estimated the

159
00:08:57.361 --> 00:09:01.020
cost at around $8 billion. However, four years later,

160
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:05.490
the reality is that Mexico has not put up a single peso nor has Trump actually

161
00:09:05.491 --> 00:09:07.380
built the wall. It's precious wall

162
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.300
while we're on the subject and internal department of Homeland security report,

163
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:17.160
estimated that Trump's proposed wall would actually cost $21.6 billion more

164
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:18.630
than double the magnates estimate.

165
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.050
We're talking about an issue that has been brought up consistently in fights

166
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:24.060
between Republicans and Democrats.

167
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.030
And as the Democrats have controlled the house of representatives in recent

168
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:29.550
years, they have blocked the allocation of funds for the wall.

169
00:09:29.551 --> 00:09:32.700
Something that led Trump to declare a national state of emergency regarding the

170
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:34.410
border in February, 2019,

171
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.520
this declaration made it possible to gain access to $15 billion by diverting

172
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:41.910
funds, from the fight against drug trafficking and from the military budget.

173
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.930
Since then, the president says the 480 kilometers of warp have been built.

174
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:49.860
But what if it gets dimension is that 420 of those kilometers have been

175
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:54.450
replacement of, or repairs to existing border structures that had deteriorated,

176
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.540
but hold on a minute because the world is not the only immigration promise that

177
00:09:57.541 --> 00:09:59.520
candidate Trump made in 2016.

178
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.610
Trump also pledged to deport all undocumented immigrants.

179
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.500
This would have resulted in the expulsion of approximately 11.3 million people

180
00:10:12.501 --> 00:10:14.060
from the United States. However,

181
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.140
the Republican candidates softened his stance on somewhat as the 2016 election

182
00:10:18.141 --> 00:10:19.070
campaign progressed.

183
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:23.000
Trump reduced to the promise deportations to about two to 3 million people

184
00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:25.730
promising to focus his efforts on driving outgrew tunnels,

185
00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.380
gang members and drug trafficking.

186
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:28.423
<v 0>Yes.</v>

187
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.450
<v 1>The reality is that the total number of people deported by Trump and his first</v>

188
00:10:35.451 --> 00:10:37.190
term is around 1 million people.

189
00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.680
Although it is true that he has tried to expel more.

190
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.260
He has encountered enormous opposition. In fact,

191
00:10:42.261 --> 00:10:45.710
one of the most controversial measures was this attempt to end of Obama's

192
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.660
immigrant child protection program.

193
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.680
It's had to go all the way to the U S Supreme court to stop him in his tracks,

194
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.300
by ruling against his proposal,

195
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.170
to send to the so-called DACA or deferred action for childhood arrivals,

196
00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.760
which protect some 650,000 young people who entered the U S without

197
00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:03.140
papers when they were just children.

198
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:05.540
The point is that if there's one thing that has changed with Trump,

199
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.800
it has been the discourse.

200
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:10.100
And don't forget the implements that Hispanics already have in Arizona,

201
00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.310
but let's go on. If we're talking about Trump and the year 2020,

202
00:11:13.311 --> 00:11:16.220
it's impossible not to talk about the pesky coronavirus.

203
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:20.120
And here it is clear that the president has not found a wall capable of stopping

204
00:11:20.121 --> 00:11:20.870
the pandemic.

205
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.750
The numbers in the United States speak for themselves at this point,

206
00:11:23.751 --> 00:11:27.200
more than 8 million infections and more than 220,000 deaths. Well,

207
00:11:27.201 --> 00:11:30.950
the biggest problem for Arizona is that 95% of its population lives in urban

208
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.963
areas.

209
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:35.630
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

210
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:39.470
<v 1>Arizona is currently the 14th, most populous state in the United States.</v>

211
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:39.861
However,

212
00:11:39.861 --> 00:11:43.640
the fact that the population is more concentrated in cities has increased the

213
00:11:43.641 --> 00:11:45.020
incidents of the virus.

214
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.290
We're talking about the state with the eighth highest number of cases,

215
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.760
more than 230,000 infections and 6,000 deaths at the time of making this video

216
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.940
in the governor of Arizona, Republican,

217
00:11:54.941 --> 00:11:59.170
Doug doosey was forced to decree the confinement of the population from April

218
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:00.003
1st, for a month and a half.

219
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:02.470
<v 0>Friends.</v>

220
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:05.230
<v 1>The coronavirus has shattered the terms on which we thought this election would</v>

221
00:12:05.231 --> 00:12:09.100
move Trump bragging about economic growth to Democrats calling for more change

222
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:13.360
in social issues, such as immigration, but 2020 has changed everyone's lives,

223
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.840
including Americans. Now, if we take a step back and look beyond that,

224
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.500
we will see that if there is one thing that has changed during these past four

225
00:12:20.501 --> 00:12:23.080
years, it has been Arizona listen up now.

226
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:27.030
<v 0>More than ever. We need a president who will put service before self</v>

227
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:32.730
the new Arizona.

228
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.990
<v 1>We've said it before. Arizona is a historically Republican stronghold and yes,</v>

229
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:43.470
four years ago, they gave their 11 electoral college votes to Donald Trump.

230
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.450
They trusted the tycoon, but since then,

231
00:12:45.451 --> 00:12:48.570
we have seen many signs of breakup between the president and the Republican

232
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.920
electorate in Arizona.

233
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.730
A key factor has surely been the contempt with which Trump treated Senator John

234
00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:55.200
McCain on several occasions.

235
00:12:55.630 --> 00:13:00.150
<v 0>War hero. He's a war fighter. He's a war hero because he was captured.</v>

236
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:02.850
I like people that weren't captured. Okay. I hate that.

237
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.760
<v 1>Yeah. The former presidential candidates who ran against Obama,</v>

238
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:08.790
never hesitated to make public his disagreements with the tycoon.

239
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:13.500
<v 2>And then there's a individual lives in Phoenix and he's</v>

240
00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:18.330
92 and he weighed 110 pounds when he got out of the German prison camp.

241
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:23.130
And he said to me, he said, Senator McCain, why does the president not like me?

242
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:28.830
You know, that's, that's hard to explain to a 92 year old man.

243
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.570
<v 1>But things go beyond any small controversy.</v>

244
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:37.470
In addition to the terrible disregard and attacks that Trump directed at McCain,

245
00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:40.740
Arizona actually feels like the guardian of the conservative soul of the

246
00:13:40.741 --> 00:13:44.010
Republican party. The disciples of Senator Barry Goldwater.

247
00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:49.523
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

248
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:53.730
<v 1>Walter was a Senator for Arizona for 30 years under the Republican party's</v>

249
00:13:53.731 --> 00:13:57.600
presidential candidate in the 1964 election. He lost a Lyndon Johnson,

250
00:13:57.601 --> 00:14:01.440
but his legacy is considered key to the revival of the conservative movement.

251
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.980
Goldwater relied on a liberal ideology, focused on three goals,

252
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.750
reducing the power of the federal government,

253
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.680
promoting economic and political freedoms and combating communism abroad.

254
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.860
The result had a familiar first and last name, Ronald Reagan.

255
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:18.690
<v 0>Not all Republicans. It is a cause of Republican Islam,</v>

256
00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.540
concentrations of power, private or public.

257
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:28.470
<v 2>Barry Goldwater will always be the Senator from Arizona.</v>

258
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.330
The one history recalls with appreciation and delight

259
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.750
in all the histories of American politics.

260
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.290
He will remain a chapter unto himself.

261
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.460
The rest of us will have to make due as footnotes.

262
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:49.620
<v 0>The fact.</v>

263
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.330
<v 1>Is that the late John McCain was a very critical voice against president Trump,</v>

264
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.110
but six months after the magnate was sworn in McCain was diagnosed with terminal

265
00:14:57.111 --> 00:14:57.500
cancer.

266
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.460
So the voice of Republican conservatism happened to be vindicated by the other

267
00:15:01.461 --> 00:15:03.410
Senator from Arizona, Jeff flake,

268
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.350
condemned to Trump's influence on the conservative movement in a book.

269
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:10.070
He denounced the Republican party for giving up all its beliefs in ideology,

270
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:14.180
in exchange for the power offered by someone as authoritarians and populists as

271
00:15:14.181 --> 00:15:14.840
Donald Trump.

272
00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:18.350
This is how the Senator himself explained it when he announced that he would not

273
00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:19.550
run for reelection.

274
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:24.730
<v 2>It is clear at this moment that a traditional conservative who believes in</v>

275
00:15:24.731 --> 00:15:28.840
limited government and free markets who is devoted to free trade,

276
00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.940
who is pro immigration as a narrow and narrow path and nomination,

277
00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:35.020
and the Republican party,

278
00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:39.910
the party that has so long defined itself by its belief in those things.

279
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.320
I think that the party has been compromised by things like populism.

280
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:47.710
I admired John McCain, my entire life in 1992,

281
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:52.390
Mr. Republican Barry Goldwater endorsed the Democrat running for Congress over a

282
00:15:52.391 --> 00:15:55.420
Republican who we felt would not represent the party well.

283
00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.930
And so it is because of my conservatism and because of my belief in the

284
00:15:58.931 --> 00:16:01.240
constitution and in the separation of powers.

285
00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:05.590
And because I am gravely concerned about the conduct and behavior of our current

286
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.620
president, that I stand here today, oddly and wholehearted,

287
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:12.490
to endorse Joe Biden as an extra president of the United States of America.

288
00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:16.863
Jeff.

289
00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:20.950
<v 1>As Senator ended in 2018 in the Senate election to fill up his vacancy pro-Trump</v>

290
00:16:20.951 --> 00:16:23.050
candidate, Martha McSally was defeated.

291
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.650
It had been 30 years since the democratic party had been able to win one of the

292
00:16:26.651 --> 00:16:29.980
two senatorial seats for Arizona. Well in the upcoming elections,

293
00:16:29.981 --> 00:16:30.790
this November 3rd,

294
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:34.090
the person who will fill the vacancy after the death of John McCain will also be

295
00:16:34.091 --> 00:16:36.760
chosen. Look, Sally is once again, the Republican candidate.

296
00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:42.160
<v 2>I had to come up fast, fast,</v>

297
00:16:42.161 --> 00:16:44.050
come on quick, you got one minute,

298
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.230
one minute mother say they don't want to hear this spot that come on.

299
00:16:47.231 --> 00:16:48.300
Let's go quick, quick, quick, quick.

300
00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:51.490
<v 1>It would be the first time since 1952,</v>

301
00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:54.760
that both senators from Arizona have belongs to the democratic party.

302
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.880
And this aspect of the polls offers little doubt. That is exactly.

303
00:16:58.130 --> 00:16:58.963
<v 2>Clean. What will happen?</v>

304
00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:06.070
<v 1>Friends? The feeling is that Trumpism is falling apart in Arizona. In fact,</v>

305
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.790
the Democrats also won the last election for the house of representatives.

306
00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:11.140
And even Joe Arpaio,

307
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.380
Trump's loyal follower has suffered three electoral setbacks.

308
00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:17.830
He lost the Maricopa County Sheriff's race to his democratic opponent.

309
00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:21.760
Then he was pardoned and competed unsuccessfully against Martha McSally for the

310
00:17:21.761 --> 00:17:22.480
Senate seat.

311
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.570
And this time around the Republicans haven't even given him the chance to be

312
00:17:25.571 --> 00:17:28.570
reelected as sheriff, our power star burned out.

313
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.990
Let's see what happens to Trump because the race in Arizona shows signs of

314
00:17:31.991 --> 00:17:32.824
breakdown.

315
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:34.600
<v 2>Former Senator Jeff flake,</v>

316
00:17:34.601 --> 00:17:39.340
former Republican Jim Colby throw support behind Joe Biden, Joe Biden.

317
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:44.373
I'm a Democrat.

318
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:50.640
I love John McCain.

319
00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.970
<v 1>Is that we have all seen this movie before Republicans in California,</v>

320
00:17:55.971 --> 00:17:58.970
tried to stoke up the fear of illegal immigrants in the 1990s.

321
00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:02.600
And all it did was prop up support of the governor by relying on the popularity

322
00:18:02.601 --> 00:18:06.050
of Arnold Schwartzenegger. But since then, well, hasta LA Vista, baby Hispanics,

323
00:18:06.051 --> 00:18:07.190
never forgave themselves.

324
00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.490
And Hispanics are gaining more of a voice in Arizona too.

325
00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.390
But now it's your turn.

326
00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.630
Do you think Arizona will continue to be a Republican stronghold?

327
00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:17.630
