1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.580
<v 0>We have an announcement to make to you all. It's good news.</v>

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.040
We have many projects for visual politic in the pipeline,

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.860
starting with a new collaboration with value school,

4
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.520
a Spanish nonprofit organization that has the goal of expanding financial

5
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:13.920
culture through a range of tools, documentaries,

6
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.550
audio recordings for radio and podcasts, books, courses, and more.

7
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.100
I'll leave the link to their website here. It's currently in Spanish,

8
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.040
but soon it will be an English. Well in collaboration with them,

9
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.030
we will prepare a special weekly video that allows us to immerse ourselves fully

10
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.030
in the world of finance. And to begin with, we propose an idea.

11
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.580
Have you ever thought about what could happen if we brought together the

12
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:36.120
brightest minds from the mathematical and the financial world in the same

13
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:36.690
project,

14
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.320
a project which makes use of complex mathematical calculations and advanced

15
00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:44.010
software that is able to model reality and therefore know where, how,

16
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.330
and when to invest.

17
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.080
You think something like this is even possible.

18
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.170
What if I told you that this experiment has already been carried out and then it

19
00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:56.930
gave rise to the largest hedge fund on the planet?

20
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.370
Do you want to know what happened?

21
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.800
How far does the power of prediction really go?

22
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.530
This is the story of long-term capital management.

23
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.360
A gigantic hedge fund led by some of the world's brightest minds that in 1998,

24
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.630
Ken close to sparking a huge slump in the financial market.

25
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.913
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

26
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.280
<v 0>You may have never even heard of this fund, but in early 1998,</v>

27
00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.430
it was one of the most coveted jewels in the world of finance,

28
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.350
a role model to follow. Despite this just a few months later in September, 1998,

29
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.380
this same fund came close to collapsing, global finance.

30
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.543
<v 1>It's.</v>

31
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.920
<v 0>A sophisticated financial engineering system a month before it collapsed</v>

32
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.180
long-term capital management with just over $4 billion in equity had managed to

33
00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:50.360
control assets of more than $120 billion.

34
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.470
All thanks to enormous leverage and all kinds of complex financial operations.

35
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.040
In total,

36
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.850
we're talking about more than 60,000 transactions recorded on the balance sheet,

37
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.600
80% we're G seven country bonds and the remaining ones were stocks.

38
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.160
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

39
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.640
<v 0>However,</v>

40
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.600
the most impressive thing was it's off balance sheet operations through all

41
00:02:11.601 --> 00:02:15.380
kinds of financial derivatives futures, swaps and options.

42
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.020
To give you an idea of the magnitude of what we're talking about here,

43
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.160
according to the report, jointly prepared by the sec, the federal reserve,

44
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.920
the us treasury department and the futures commission,

45
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.520
the notional value defined as the value of the assets behind the derivatives

46
00:02:28.521 --> 00:02:33.410
contracts traded by this fund amounted to $500 billion in foreign exchange

47
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.040
futures,

48
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.960
$750 billion in swaps and another $150 billion

49
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.130
in options and other.

50
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.173
<v 1>That derivatives.</v>

51
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.480
<v 0>Important figures that made this fund, the largest hedge fund in history.</v>

52
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.410
However, on Wednesday, September 23rd, 1998,

53
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.730
the federal reserve urgently had to launch a large scale rescue operation so

54
00:02:58.731 --> 00:02:59.564
that the,

55
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.610
of this fund known until then as the rolls Royce of hedge funds would not cause

56
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:05.830
a real earthquake in global finance.

57
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.880
<v 1>Now.</v>

58
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.220
<v 0>Exactly this company do what is a hedge fund.</v>

59
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.060
What happened to make everything fall like a house of cards in 1998,

60
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.953
let's begin.

61
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.970
<v 1>The best of the best.</v>

62
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.260
<v 0>Long-term capital management was founded in 1994 by John Merryweather,</v>

63
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.270
a former executive at Solomon brothers,

64
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.730
one of wall Street's most historic investment banks.

65
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.460
But do you remember the question I asked you at the beginning of this video

66
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.610
about bringing together some of the brightest minds in mathematics and the

67
00:03:38.611 --> 00:03:40.830
financial world for the same project? Well,

68
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.070
that is exactly what John Merryweather did create something like the league of

69
00:03:44.071 --> 00:03:46.290
extraordinary gentlemen in the financial world.

70
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.020
<v 1>LTCM United the beautiful people from quantitative investment in an attractive</v>

71
00:03:52.021 --> 00:03:55.050
new hedge fund, Gregory Millman, 1995.

72
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.590
<v 0>Talking about characters, such as former federal reserve, vice president,</v>

73
00:03:58.591 --> 00:04:00.450
David Mullins, Eric Rosenfeld,

74
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.440
a former Harvard professor and future noble economics, laureates, Robert Merton,

75
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.530
and Myron Schultz authors of the popular black Sholes model.

76
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.250
A model used to value options that is studied in all economics and business

77
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.084
faculties.

78
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.313
<v 1>World.</v>

79
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.210
<v 0>We should point out that Robert Merton and Myron shells not only acted as</v>

80
00:04:18.211 --> 00:04:20.040
partners and consultants for the projects,

81
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.950
but also directly responsible for designing, implementing,

82
00:04:22.951 --> 00:04:27.120
and evaluating both the valuation algorithms and the complex computer software

83
00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:30.660
that traders used on a daily basis in order to decide what trading they should

84
00:04:30.661 --> 00:04:31.500
do in this way.

85
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.920
You could say that long-term capital management tried to implement that old

86
00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:38.400
dream of uniting academic knowledge with the practical experience of the

87
00:04:38.401 --> 00:04:42.630
markets. This goal was to model reality, using complex econometric formulas,

88
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.460
to be able to find the best investments and neutralize.

89
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.553
<v 1>The risk.</v>

90
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.411
<v 0>Said this approach.</v>

91
00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:53.940
They were able to secure just over $2 billion from very high level investors to

92
00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:56.640
give you an idea, the minimum subscription was $10 million,

93
00:04:56.641 --> 00:05:00.300
but having said that, what exactly was this fund? What was it investing in?

94
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.030
Let's answer these questions, but I think first of all,

95
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.940
we need to clear up just exactly what a hedge fund is.

96
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.160
<v 1>Don't you? Well.</v>

97
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.890
<v 0>It's not easy to define what is and what isn't a hedge fund.</v>

98
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.680
Let's say they are instruments similar to investment funds,

99
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.640
but usually aimed at professional investors and are subject to very scant

100
00:05:17.641 --> 00:05:18.240
regulation.

101
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.200
They virtually lack any limitation on how to trade a hedge fund aims to try to

102
00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:24.990
maximize its profitability through financial engineering,

103
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.160
different levels of leverage and the intensive use of financial derivative. Yes,

104
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.060
I think that pretty much describes it. Well, we'll see more in detail anyway,

105
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.540
in an upcoming video here on visual politic, but okay, let's move on.

106
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.090
Long-term capital was basically to be a hedge fund and the style known as long

107
00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:45.540
short. Let me explain it was looking for correlated assets in this case,

108
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.740
Mandy bonds that would historically have been related in a certain way and which

109
00:05:49.741 --> 00:05:52.220
for different temporal reasons had an anomalous.

110
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.250
<v 1>In this way. The hedge fund opened long positions.</v>

111
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.910
<v 0>I invested in relatively cheaper bonds. And at the same time,</v>

112
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.060
they were short selling relatively more expensive bonds,

113
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.230
venturing that over time it would return to its starting relation. For example,

114
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.920
one of the most important operations was to buy German bonds with a maturity of

115
00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:17.360
30 years and simultaneously short sell German bonds for 10 years. Why?

116
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.820
Because their models had determined that at the time,

117
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:22.550
the spread between the two types of bonds was extra ordinary.

118
00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.853
<v 1>Hi.</v>

119
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.770
<v 0>Look, when we talk about an abnormal differential, we may be talking about very,</v>

120
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.840
very small differences. In fact,

121
00:06:31.841 --> 00:06:35.680
in most trades margins were minuscule and so doing many trades and maintaining

122
00:06:35.681 --> 00:06:38.350
very high leverage was essential for increasing profits

123
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.210
To better understand the effect of leverage in a simplified way.

124
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.930
Take a look at this. That could be the balance sheet of a hedge fund like this.

125
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.230
Remember that equity is the resources provided by investors,

126
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.020
the rest of liabilities, debts and repayment commitments.

127
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.860
The fact is that this means that there are many more resources working to

128
00:06:59.861 --> 00:07:02.860
generate profits on the contributed capital. The problem, however,

129
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.670
is that the margins are so small that if an adverse scenario occurs and this

130
00:07:06.671 --> 00:07:08.770
capital may not be enough to bear the losses.

131
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.620
And then there is an asset hole and the company goes bankrupt,

132
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:12.483
but we'll talk about.

133
00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:13.443
<v 1>Later.</v>

134
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:17.800
<v 0>The way,</v>

135
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.250
remember this point for later on another big gamble of this hedge fund was to

136
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:24.700
invest in Spanish and Italian bonds against German bonds.

137
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.300
Thinking that the advent of the Euro would lead to a convergence in the yield

138
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.100
offered by the bonds of these countries.

139
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.060
So at this point,

140
00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.360
the question we need to ask is how did they do this with this strategy?

141
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.120
What were the early days of long-term capital management?

142
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.470
Like to what extent did all of these economic trick techniques managed to tame

143
00:07:44.471 --> 00:07:45.340
the market? Okay,

144
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:49.870
let's take a look from the days of wine and roses to the storm.

145
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.820
The truth is that these first few years were good, very good, better than good,

146
00:07:54.821 --> 00:07:56.710
even spectacular to give you an idea,

147
00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.370
the net profitability of commissions and management costs of long-term capital

148
00:08:00.371 --> 00:08:03.820
management with 42.8% in 1995,

149
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:08.380
40.8% in 1996 and even 17.1% in

150
00:08:08.381 --> 00:08:09.730
1997 apps,

151
00:08:09.731 --> 00:08:13.560
the outbreak of the Asian crisis that we will also talk about in depth here on

152
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.413
visual politic.

153
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.370
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

154
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:22.270
<v 0>And that's not all in 1997, Robert Merton and Myron Shoals,</v>

155
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.730
two of the firm's partners. And as we have already mentioned,

156
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:28.750
those responsible for the algorithms used to decide investments were awarded the

157
00:08:28.751 --> 00:08:30.400
Nobel prize in economics.

158
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.760
So you can already imagine how by early 1998,

159
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:38.470
this fund was one of the great stars of wall street algorithms,

160
00:08:38.471 --> 00:08:42.760
formulas, software computers, long-term capital management was a revolution,

161
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:46.930
the icon of a new era of unlimited profits and new risks. After all,

162
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.440
if algorithms were able to predict market trends and efficiently calculate the

163
00:08:50.441 --> 00:08:54.820
movements that were going to occur, what could possibly go wrong? However,

164
00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:57.090
these had one essential floor.

165
00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.660
They assumed that the market was fully rational and the past events could

166
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:02.550
efficiently predict future ones.

167
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.480
And that floor was something that in 1998 was going to become painfully clear as

168
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:09.390
it is often the case in markets, something which no one expected.

169
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.060
<v 1>Happened. The crisis.</v>

170
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.390
<v 0>That broke out in 1997, when Asian economies collapsed,</v>

171
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.350
continue to have repercussions. And to top it off in August, 1998,

172
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.900
Russia effected by its bad economic situation,

173
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:26.070
devalued the ruble and defaulted that is it's suspended payment of its sovereign

174
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:29.040
debt. And that that's caused a tsunami in the markets.

175
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:33.600
Suddenly there was a whole stampede towards safer markets and products such as

176
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:34.883
us government debt,

177
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:41.190
And this way the money began to flood out and everything seemed to be at risk.

178
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.290
This meant that liquidity in financial markets,

179
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:47.460
evaporated and spreads as well as risk premiums and companies and the most

180
00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:50.400
troubled countries skyrocketed. So in this situation,

181
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.830
this particular hedge fund took a huge hit.

182
00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:57.440
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

183
00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.040
<v 0>For example,</v>

184
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.490
long-term capital management was committed to some convergence between the yield

185
00:10:01.491 --> 00:10:03.740
on the us bonds and emerging market bonds,

186
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:07.040
because they had statistically determined that the spread between the two types

187
00:10:07.041 --> 00:10:09.860
of debt was very high. And that way, as we've seen before,

188
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.000
they invested in emerging country debt while selling short us debt well after

189
00:10:14.001 --> 00:10:15.080
the Russian default,

190
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.320
what happened was that that differential increased even more.

191
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.570
And the same thing happened with the stock markets.

192
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:25.160
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

193
00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.970
<v 0>Similarly the spread between the U S government bonds paid and bonds from Sylvan</v>

194
00:10:28.971 --> 00:10:32.030
companies had never moved more than two or three points in two days,

195
00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.030
but it suddenly moved 21 points on August 21st.

196
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.280
What LTCM has risk models judged,

197
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:40.820
practically impossible occurred less than five years after the founding of this

198
00:10:40.821 --> 00:10:44.180
hedge fund that move alone resulted in losses of several hundred million

199
00:10:44.181 --> 00:10:45.014
dollars.

200
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.940
And do you remember the bonds of the European countries that we mentioned before

201
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.270
and where long-term capital was committed to its convergence? Well,

202
00:10:53.271 --> 00:10:54.920
quite the opposite happened there as well.

203
00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.190
The risk premium of countries such as Spain or Italy compared to Germany,

204
00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.053
also in Greece,

205
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:05.270
The world was experiencing the exact opposite scenario as outlined in the

206
00:11:05.271 --> 00:11:06.800
strategy of this fund fear.

207
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:10.190
And current events proved too much for the algorithms and statistical records.

208
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.070
And so this is how LTC M's collapse occurred.

209
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:16.520
<v 1>The fall of geniuses.</v>

210
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.000
<v 0>After the Russian default things went from bad to worse by mid-September the</v>

211
00:11:23.001 --> 00:11:25.040
fund had already lost more than 40%.

212
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.033
<v 1>It's capital.</v>

213
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.150
<v 0>A situation that had two immediate consequences. On one hand,</v>

214
00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.340
the funds leveraged sought further. Of course,

215
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.730
the same liability to much lower capital costs, leverage to soar.

216
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:38.540
And on the other hand,

217
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.360
the fall in their positions forced them to provide more guarantees,

218
00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:42.260
but there was a problem.

219
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.470
It didn't have enough capital and their investors weren't willing to put in any

220
00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:48.290
more money. The Casa was beginning to Teeter very badly.

221
00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.600
And that's how we arrive at the moment before the rescue.

222
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:54.340
<v 1>Look at this, the abrupt and disorderly closure.</v>

223
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:58.600
<v 2>Of LTCM positions, poses, unacceptable risks to the U S economy,</v>

224
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.780
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the federal reserve in 1998.

225
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.140
<v 0>Avoid such a scenario.</v>

226
00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:07.950
The federal reserve coordinated the rescue for long-term capital management.

227
00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.280
A bailout that was carried out in practice are the world's leading investment

228
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:14.880
banks, entities, such as Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bush bank,

229
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:19.410
and a union of Swiss banks among others had to disperse more than $4 billion to

230
00:12:19.411 --> 00:12:20.520
stabilize the situation.

231
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.850
The great project of bringing together the brightest minds to model markets

232
00:12:23.851 --> 00:12:26.430
through algorithms and computer systems came to an end,

233
00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.240
the thesis of market efficiency and statistical predictability clashed.

234
00:12:30.241 --> 00:12:31.680
With reality there you have it.

235
00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.560
This is the surprising story of long-term capital management.
