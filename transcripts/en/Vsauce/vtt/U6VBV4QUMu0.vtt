00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.933
<v 0>No.</v>

2
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.510
<v 1>Vsauce Michael here. Why though? Why are any of us here?</v>

3
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.690
What's the purpose? What does it all mean? Well,

4
00:00:17.691 --> 00:00:20.060
sometimes if we listen closely enough,

5
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.620
when we ask why we can hear an answer and it's another

6
00:00:24.621 --> 00:00:27.740
question why, why,

7
00:00:27.741 --> 00:00:31.040
what our journey begins here.

8
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.920
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>

9
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.753
<v 1>Is that true?</v>

10
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.710
Is there really no rule against a dog playing middle school basketball,

11
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.990
Vsauce magic eight ball.

12
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.410
Is there really no rule against a dog playing basketball?

13
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.630
The answer is yes or is it?

14
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:01.850
We have begun.

15
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.990
<v 2>The actor who played air bud buddy.</v>

16
00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:10.610
The dog passed away in 1998 at the age.

17
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.940
<v 1>Of nine. I'll take a look at this.</v>

18
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.210
Let's talk about world war II

19
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.900
on June 28th, 1914, Franz Ferdinand,

20
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.160
the heir to the throne of Austria Hungary and his wife SoFi were

21
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:34.820
assassinated in Sarah Gevo while riding in a car,

22
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.070
the cars license plate was a I I one,

23
00:01:40.071 --> 00:01:43.490
one eight, they were killed by Gavrilo Princip.

24
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.110
Who said during his trial that he wanted the unification of all Hugo

25
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.870
slops free from Austria.

26
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.790
The event sparked a series of escalations in Europe, the July crisis,

27
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.430
which ultimately caused world war one,

28
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.850
a war that ended on armistice day,

29
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.720
November 11th, 1918,

30
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.780
pretty odd, huh?

31
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.470
A spooky coincidence, if you will,

32
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.440
but look odd things happen all the time.

33
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.320
Oddness is all around us,

34
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.220
especially in the form of odd numbers.

35
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.270
The grip they have on our reality is revealed.

36
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.610
When we release our grip,

37
00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.610
notice anything strange under the influence of gravity things,

38
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.130
move in an odd way.

39
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.600
If something starts moving because of gravity after say one second,

40
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.960
it will have traveled some distance. Now, interestingly,

41
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.840
during the next second, the distance,

42
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.450
it will travel will be three times.

43
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.860
As far as it moved during the first second, during the third, second,

44
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:57.140
it will travel five times as far,

45
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.540
then seven times then times 11, 13, 15,

46
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.010
we used seconds, but it doesn't matter what time interval you use.

47
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.770
You will always find this pattern.

48
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.960
The odd number rule hiding right there within the very

49
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:18.760
phenomenon that keeps us on earth or the odd numbers.

50
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.850
More like God numbers, right,

51
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.760
is the odd number rule the face of the universe. Looking back at us. Well,

52
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.950
here is something that Galileo wrote.

53
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.350
Philosophy is written in this grand book. I mean the universe,

54
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.350
which stands continuously open to our gaze,

55
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.880
but it can not be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language

56
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.020
in which it is written.

57
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.330
It is written in the language of mathematics and its characters are

58
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:53.020
triangles, circles, and other geometric figures,

59
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.760
without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it

60
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.890
without these one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth.

61
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.850
Before this pattern in the grand book of the universe was read and appreciated

62
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.150
people wondered why things fell. Uh,

63
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.740
maybe stuff just has a desire to be in its own proper place, right?

64
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.250
Rocks with the earth fire with the air. That makes sense, right? Oh,

65
00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:25.420
it was fun to imagine clauses and write our own stories.

66
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.600
But underneath our desire for explanations,

67
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.570
a story was already being told.

68
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.310
One that is written in the language of mathematics measure

69
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.960
and relation. Now,

70
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:41.050
many of these stories are being told all around us all the time,

71
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:45.040
one on top of each other. But if we can look past those disturbances,

72
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.080
each isolated event is narrating a quiet, simple story.

73
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.260
Not of why the universe is,

74
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.110
but of what the universe is.

75
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.300
Galileo recognized what this pattern is spelled mathematically it

76
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:05.560
spells, hello. I am speeding up at a constant rate.

77
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.000
And that was huge. All this time for millennia.

78
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:14.710
We had been wondering about the causes of gravity. It's cosmic purpose,

79
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.750
why it existed, but now here was someone saying, yeah, yeah, cool.

80
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.490
But like, what does it do? It makes things fall great. Well,

81
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.740
what does that mean? What does it mean to fall?

82
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.770
[inaudible] how now the human mind alone. I couldn't answer that,

83
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.560
but the universe was telling us,

84
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.450
we just had to speak its language and read it. This is,

85
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.130
I am gaining velocity at a constant rate spelled with odd numbers.

86
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.120
How well what's an odd number.

87
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.850
The concept of oddness comes from the observation that sometimes when you have a

88
00:05:53.851 --> 00:05:58.460
bunch of things, everything you have can be paired.

89
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.410
<v 3>Up, but sometimes that can't happen. Now,</v>

90
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.320
when it's possible, when you compare everything up that you have,

91
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:11.090
it is said that the number of things you have is even if you

92
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:15.620
can't do that, then the number of things you have is odd.

93
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.101
Now,

94
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:20.990
what this means is that the number of objects in an even group is

95
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:25.880
equal to two times N where N is just the number

96
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:30.260
of whole pairs that you have. So in is any whole number in could be,

97
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:34.940
for example, 50, giving us the even number of 100,

98
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.390
which is also the number of legs centipedes have,

99
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.843
or is it.

100
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.650
<v 1>Center 100 peed feet.</v>

101
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.160
Having 100 legs is right there in the name,

102
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.290
but it's only approximate centipedes have been observed to have anywhere from 30

103
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.660
to 345 legs.

104
00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.160
Now 100 falls pretty nicely in that range. Uh,

105
00:07:00.161 --> 00:07:05.020
but every pair of legs on a centipede is attached to a

106
00:07:05.021 --> 00:07:09.160
body segment, which means that in order to have 100 legs,

107
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.060
a centipede would need to have 50 body segments,

108
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:18.250
but not a single species of centipede has an even number of body segments.

109
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.930
50 segments is nowhere to be found in the library of centipede genomes.

110
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.600
So while centipedes on average have a number of legs, quite close to 100,

111
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.490
they never naturally have exactly. 100.

112
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.560
<v 3>Point is two N is the mathematical way to spell.</v>

113
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.250
Even if I add just one more thing,

114
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.340
the amount I have is no longer, even it's odd.

115
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.570
If I add yet another thing I've added another pair and has gone up by one.

116
00:07:49.571 --> 00:07:53.530
And the number is even again, this means that an even number,

117
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.910
plus just one more will always be odd now that we know how to

118
00:07:57.911 --> 00:07:59.740
mathematically spell odd.

119
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:04.690
And even we can move on to moving if

120
00:08:04.691 --> 00:08:08.410
you and me hugged. Well, that would be wonderful.

121
00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.090
We would both get so much out of it. But if during the hug,

122
00:08:13.091 --> 00:08:15.730
you suddenly ran away from me while yelling,

123
00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:20.940
I'm leaving you at a velocity of two meters per second. Well,

124
00:08:20.941 --> 00:08:24.520
I would be devastated, but I would know that deep down,

125
00:08:24.521 --> 00:08:28.480
you still cared for me because you told me your velocity.

126
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.190
And if I know your velocity,

127
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.480
I can know just how far away you are from me at all times.

128
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:38.680
All I have to do is take your velocity and multiply it by the number of seconds

129
00:08:38.681 --> 00:08:41.920
that have elapsed. Since you left now,

130
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:46.270
take a look at what a graph of your velocity would look like here.

131
00:08:46.271 --> 00:08:49.600
We have velocity in meters, away from me per second,

132
00:08:49.601 --> 00:08:53.200
and we have time in seconds since the hug ended. Now,

133
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.300
if your velocity is two meters per and that persists,

134
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.600
then here's a graph of your velocity. But look at this.

135
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.410
After a number of seconds have elapsed like after one second,

136
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:09.300
the distance you are away is just the rate times the time elapsed two times one.

137
00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:14.310
Well, that also happens to be the area of the rectangle bounded by a

138
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.450
line coming up from the time your velocity graph and our axes. Well,

139
00:09:18.451 --> 00:09:21.060
that's pretty convenient. After two seconds,

140
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.930
you are two times to four meters away from me,

141
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:29.250
which is also the area of this shape. We've created after three seconds.

142
00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:32.550
You are three times two, one, two, three, four, five, six meters away.

143
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.330
It's always the area. Well, that's pretty convenient,

144
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:39.560
but let's change up the story. What if we hugged?

145
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:45.470
And it was great. I mean, just, almost, not even a hug,

146
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.050
like something new is being invented here,

147
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:53.090
but then during that, you suddenly leave. You run away from me.

148
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:57.920
And while you run you yell, I am leaving you at an ever-changing velocity.

149
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.260
Why would say, you know what? That is a lot less helpful.

150
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.910
Now let's say that this changing velocity you have that I don't know,

151
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:12.530
happens to be an acceleration of two meters per second per second.

152
00:10:12.531 --> 00:10:13.460
What does that mean? Well,

153
00:10:13.461 --> 00:10:17.540
that means that your velocity is getting bigger by two meters per second.

154
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.080
For every second that you run, it would look like this on a graph.

155
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:25.190
You begin hugging me with no velocity. And then one second later,

156
00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:29.870
your velocity is two meters per second, larger two larger than zero is two.

157
00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.230
That's your velocity. After one second, after two seconds,

158
00:10:33.231 --> 00:10:38.120
your velocity is two larger, still so four, and then six,

159
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.900
your velocity graph would look something like this,

160
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.900
but now here's a question. If you're moving,

161
00:10:44.901 --> 00:10:49.640
like this is the distance you are away from me at any given time, time,

162
00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.780
still just the area of the shape. Bounded.

163
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:59.270
It's harder to see that because you don't maintain any single velocity for any

164
00:10:59.271 --> 00:11:01.490
amount of time. Your velocity is always changing.

165
00:11:01.491 --> 00:11:03.530
So we don't have nice rectangles.

166
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:08.990
We can see that it is true by putting ourselves in my shoes, abandoned alone.

167
00:11:08.991 --> 00:11:12.920
I don't even know your emotion. I don't even know how you're accelerating.

168
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.880
It's very scary, but I can decide.

169
00:11:16.881 --> 00:11:20.900
I had to take matters into my own hands and measure your velocity.

170
00:11:20.901 --> 00:11:25.370
As often as I like, let's say that I measure it just once. Um,

171
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.760
I measure it after let's say two seconds. All right, wonderful.

172
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:34.010
Now the question I want to answer is how far away you are after

173
00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:37.520
three seconds. All right. So I have this measurement.

174
00:11:37.521 --> 00:11:42.260
I know that you were traveling at four meters per second. Well,

175
00:11:42.261 --> 00:11:43.340
I mean, look,

176
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:47.720
if you're going four meters per second for one second,

177
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:53.170
then that's a rectangle like this and it's got an area of

178
00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:56.620
four. Um, but you're not four meters away. Are you?

179
00:11:56.621 --> 00:12:00.460
You're a lot further than that because you weren't traveling four meters per

180
00:12:00.461 --> 00:12:02.830
second for this entire second. You were at all times,

181
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:07.830
I was actually traveling a bit faster and I'm totally forgetting all the

182
00:12:07.831 --> 00:12:12.030
distance you covered before my measurement, which is not zero. Uh, okay.

183
00:12:12.031 --> 00:12:15.180
So clear, really? I need to measure your velocity more frequently.

184
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.080
So let's say that I measure your velocity twice during the three seconds.

185
00:12:19.081 --> 00:12:19.980
I'm curious about,

186
00:12:19.981 --> 00:12:24.480
let's say I measure it after one second and then after two seconds.

187
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.200
Well, now I can imagine rectangles here.

188
00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:31.920
This one is two by one. So it has an area of two.

189
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.410
This one is four by one.

190
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.800
So it has an area of focus or two plus four is six,

191
00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.910
but you're a lot more than six meters away as well because you weren't traveling

192
00:12:41.911 --> 00:12:45.060
two meters per second. This entire time you were actually speeding up,

193
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:46.380
covering more and more distance.

194
00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.560
I'm totally forgetting all the distance you covered over here.

195
00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.160
Basically this method will always leave me short,

196
00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:57.450
but the more frequently check your velocity, the better things. Get,

197
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.070
take a look at this. Oh yeah. Oh wow.

198
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:06.000
As you can see, the more frequently I check your velocity,

199
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:10.950
the closer my calculation gets to being based off of what you really did,

200
00:13:10.951 --> 00:13:15.690
your actual motion, but also the more frequently I check your velocity,

201
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.820
the closer the combined area of all of my rectangles gets to simply being

202
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.690
equal to the actual area bounded by your velocity curve,

203
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.510
which means that the area under your velocity curve,

204
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.590
even when your curve is like,

205
00:13:28.591 --> 00:13:32.160
this is still totally the distance you are away from me.

206
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.480
Now let's take this knowledge and apply it to the odd number. Rule

207
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:42.540
four people knew how things fell. There were some pretty good guesses. Uh,

208
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:43.890
for example, if the,

209
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:48.450
the reason things fall is that they have within them a desire to be in their own

210
00:13:48.451 --> 00:13:50.850
proper place, uh, in this example,

211
00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.590
well then maybe the closer this object gets to the table,

212
00:13:55.591 --> 00:13:58.350
the more excited it is to be there. And the faster it goes,

213
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.970
in which case it's velocity would change over time like this getting steeper and

214
00:14:02.971 --> 00:14:03.870
steeper and steeper.

215
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:08.250
But Galileo didn't think that he believed that when objects fell,

216
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.220
their velocities increased at a constant rate.

217
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:15.780
So graft like this velocity would just follow a straight line.

218
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.080
Let's draw a straight line. Beautiful.

219
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.270
Now let's divide this graph up into strips of equal time. Perfect.

220
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:28.470
All right. Now, as we know the areas of the shapes,

221
00:14:28.471 --> 00:14:33.030
we have bounded here are the distances traveled during their

222
00:14:33.031 --> 00:14:35.250
respective time intervals.

223
00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:39.750
So what's the area of our first shape here. A little triangle. Well,

224
00:14:39.751 --> 00:14:43.170
we don't know what it is. We don't have any, um, actual, uh,

225
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.260
markings here on our axes, but that's fine. It doesn't really matter.

226
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:50.520
We'll just call this one. So in the first second,

227
00:14:50.521 --> 00:14:51.800
or the first time interval,

228
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.920
our object traveled a distance of one unit of space.

229
00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:01.480
Perfect. Now, how far did our object travel during the second time interval?

230
00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:06.250
Well, that distance will be equal to that area. Well, what is this area? Well,

231
00:15:06.251 --> 00:15:11.050
one thing we can do to make this easier is to divide the shape like

232
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:14.680
this. Now we have two shapes, a triangle and a rectangle.

233
00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:19.630
This triangle has the exact same area as our initial

234
00:15:19.631 --> 00:15:22.870
triangle. That's because they are congruent triangles.

235
00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:25.120
They both have the same base length.

236
00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.810
And because this velocity line has a constant slope,

237
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:33.670
it rises the same amount per time elapsed all the time.

238
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:36.580
So their Heights are the same and they're both right triangles.

239
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.140
Their areas are the same.

240
00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:43.090
So the area of this space is the

241
00:15:43.091 --> 00:15:46.570
area of that triangle. Plus the area of this rectangle.

242
00:15:46.571 --> 00:15:48.760
What is the area of this rectangle? Well,

243
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:51.610
one thing we can do is divide the,

244
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.930
the rectangle in half with the diagonal like this, and look what we've created.

245
00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.850
This triangle has the exact same area as our initial triangle.

246
00:16:00.851 --> 00:16:04.540
It has the same height. It has the same base. They're both right angles.

247
00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.870
And look, the same goes for this one. It's a right triangle.

248
00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:09.730
It's base is the same as this space.

249
00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:12.490
It's height as the same as this one's height. Gosh,

250
00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:16.000
this is just the area of the initial triangle, but twice.

251
00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:20.650
So we have two of them and we have two of them one time.

252
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:26.080
Okay, perfect. Now let's move on to finding the area of that shape.

253
00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:27.011
Once again,

254
00:16:27.011 --> 00:16:31.420
I can divide this shape like

255
00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.810
that. And now I have a triangle, which as we know,

256
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:39.250
has the same area as our initial triangle right here.

257
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.830
So we have that area one.

258
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.990
And then we also have look at that two rectangles, which as we know,

259
00:16:46.991 --> 00:16:48.910
we can divide in half like this,

260
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:53.890
giving us now four triangles equal in area to the initial one.

261
00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:58.720
So what we've done is we've taken the initial area and we have doubled it, uh,

262
00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:03.010
well, once and then twice. So two times now, as we continue doing this,

263
00:17:03.011 --> 00:17:07.390
we find that we're always adding one more of our original areas.

264
00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:11.650
And then we're always doubling that original area. One more time here.

265
00:17:11.651 --> 00:17:15.310
We've doubled it. One to three times doubled three times.

266
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.920
We'll look at this pattern right here.

267
00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:22.900
We can think of one as being equal to two times zero plus one. Can't we, well,

268
00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:27.070
these numbers are whole numbers and they're just going up by one zero one, two,

269
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:27.700
three.

270
00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:32.290
This is all of the general form two N plus one.

271
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:35.710
That is how you mathematically spell odd.

272
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:39.910
So the odd number rule is not kind of magical coincidence.

273
00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.640
It's just what happens when an objects,

274
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.880
it increases at a constant rate.

275
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:50.160
The answer was right there in front of us, all written.

276

298
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:38.360
Welcome back. Now, Colorado looks like a rectangle,

299
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.300
a shape with four sides that all meet at the same angle,

300
00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.780
but Colorado doesn't have four sides.

301
00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:50.060
It has 697 making it not a rectangle,

302
00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.180
but instead a hex, a hectic, any eye contact high Pepticon.

303
00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:55.340
And this was all by mistake.

304
00:19:55.730 --> 00:20:00.020
The United States Congress initially defined Colorado as a geo spiritual

305
00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:00.863
rectangle,

306
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:05.420
the space bounded by two lines of latitude and two lines of longitude

307
00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:10.820
in the 19th century surveyors set out to demarcate it's shaped actually market

308
00:20:10.821 --> 00:20:15.740
on the ground. And they did a phenomenal job with the tools that they had,

309
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:17.210
but mistakes were made.

310
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.930
Some were large enough that you can spot them on many common maps of the state

311
00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.970
in 1925,

312
00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:27.950
the U S Supreme court ruled that the borders as surveyed were the correct

313
00:20:27.951 --> 00:20:32.450
ones and would legally stand as the official recognized edges of the

314
00:20:32.451 --> 00:20:33.284
state,

315
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:37.970
not the originally intended theoretically pure geosphere trickle rectangle,

316
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:42.920
thus ending the shaping of Colorado that began with lines drawn by the

317
00:20:42.921 --> 00:20:44.960
compromise of 1850

318
00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:48.700
1850.

319
00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.870
We have arrived article 18, section five,

320
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:59.400
paragraph zero of the Washington interscholastic activities association,

321
00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:01.950
1996 to 97 constitution.

322
00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:06.690
The set of rules air bud would have been subject to at the time and place of the

323
00:21:06.691 --> 00:21:10.890
movie States that in order to participate in an interscholastic athletic

324
00:21:10.891 --> 00:21:14.910
activity like basketball, a student must be a quote,

325
00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.980
regular member of the school defined as someone enrolled half-time

326
00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.053
or more.

327
00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:26.130
The section does refer to RCW 28 eight two two five Oh one Oh a

328
00:21:26.131 --> 00:21:27.900
list of approved exceptions,

329
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:32.400
but not one of these was considered in the case of air bud, had they been,

330
00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.700
it would have been discovered quite quickly that air bud,

331
00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:39.330
the dog qualified under absolutely none of them.

332
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:44.730
There is no rule that specifically States a dog cannot play basketball,

333
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:49.530
