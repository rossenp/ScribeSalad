00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.850
<v 0>Hey Vsauce Michael here.</v>

2
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.720
Do you want to see the most illegal thing I own?

3
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.840
It's a penny from 2027. That's right.

4
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.140
It's a piece of counterfeit us currency.

5
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.670
<v 1>Or is it, there are no 20, 27 pennies today,</v>

6
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.350
which means that this is a counterfeit of an original,

7
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.800
that doesn't exist yet. I mean, sure. If you didn't look at the date,

8
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.000
this could pass as real,

9
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.800
but will it not truly be counterfeit until 2027?

10
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.700
Well, what we do know is that it's novelty has a lifespan.

11
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:04.340
It's really cool to show people today. It's a penny from the future,

12
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.500
but in 2027, it will become indistinguishable from a common penny.

13
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.180
And it will cease to be as interesting. I cannot tell you where I got this,

14
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.250
but the point is I can break the law. I am free,

15
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.360
perhaps not free from punishment, but nonetheless, here we are.

16
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.310
The thing is though, I cannot break the laws of physics.

17
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.713
Nothing can.

18
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.473
<v 0>Why.</v>

19
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.050
<v 1>Today I want to look at the lawful behavior of spinning.</v>

20
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.240
Let's start with a physics classic.

21
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.360
As a spinning ice skater pulls their body in closer.

22
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.970
They spin faster and faster. It's really cool,

23
00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:49.370
but what is accelerating their rotation?

24
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.370
What is pushing them around faster and faster?

25
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.720
You can try this at home with a chair that spins and some really heavy books in

26
00:01:56.721 --> 00:02:01.250
both hands now to get started spinning. I'm going to have Jake, give me a push,

27
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.900
but I don't need Jake men. And I'll watch this with him gone.

28
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.410
I can nonetheless speed myself up by just pulling the books in.

29
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.180
If I move the books out.

30
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.453
<v 0>I slow down.</v>

31
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.800
<v 1>Somehow pulling the books in, speeds me up around. Now,</v>

32
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.390
if you look up why this happens,

33
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:25.370
you'll probably be told that it is because of the conservation of angular

34
00:02:25.371 --> 00:02:26.204
momentum.

35
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.213
<v 0>Oh.</v>

36
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.370
<v 1>Conservation of angular momentum. I love demonstrations of it.</v>

37
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.880
And this is one of my favorites. This is a Hoberman sphere,

38
00:02:37.881 --> 00:02:42.260
a toy that collapses and expands.

39
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.400
Doesn't it sort of remind you of me with the books far from my body and in the

40
00:02:46.401 --> 00:02:48.710
books, close to my body.

41
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.470
And it behaves in much the same way.

42
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.250
I need to give it some angular momentum to start. But once I do,

43
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.210
if I bring all of that mass towards the axis of rotation,

44
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.090
it speeds up and then it slows down and then it speeds up

45
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.860
and then it slows down. Speeds up, slows down.

46
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.620
I love this. Thank you. Cute conservation of angular momentum,

47
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.070
but what are you? Well, if you look it up,

48
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.020
this is what you will find for a particle in circular motion

49
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.000
around some center of rotation.

50
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.340
See the angular momentum of the particle is defined as the product of the

51
00:03:32.341 --> 00:03:34.860
particles, mass, the particles,

52
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.870
instantaneous velocity B and the particles distance from

53
00:03:39.871 --> 00:03:44.460
the center of rotation, R M V R.

54
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.530
This is angular momentum. If you divided me and the chair and the books,

55
00:03:49.531 --> 00:03:53.700
I'm holding into a bunch of tiny little particles and found the MBRs for every

56
00:03:53.701 --> 00:03:55.290
one of those particles and sum them all up.

57
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.650
You would have the angular momentum of the entire system of me,

58
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.180
the chair and the books. But notice that this is just a mathematical expression,

59
00:04:03.181 --> 00:04:07.170
combining three different measures. It's not a physical substance.

60
00:04:07.171 --> 00:04:10.500
You could pull out of a particle and holding your hand or put in a jar and

61
00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:12.600
study. It's kind of like, Oh, I don't know,

62
00:04:12.601 --> 00:04:16.500
taking like my weight and multiplying it by the number of countries on earth and

63
00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:20.430
then multiplying it by the time. However, unlike something like that,

64
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.870
this concept is really useful because we have found that in our universe over

65
00:04:24.871 --> 00:04:26.910
time, it is conserved.

66
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.620
If the particle is pulled towards the center of rotation,

67
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.030
it's our value will go down. But angular momentum is conserved.

68
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.530
So one of these other variables must go up well at low speeds,

69
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:41.880
mass is essentially constant.

70
00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:46.560
So the only option is for the velocity of the particle to increase for the

71
00:04:46.561 --> 00:04:49.800
particle to spin around faster than it was before.

72
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.630
If the R value gets smaller,

73
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.040
the velocity must get larger or else a law has been broken.

74
00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.740
But how do atoms and molecules know to follow this law? I mean,

75
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.790
is there some kind of physics police force in the universe bullying everything

76
00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:10.620
into compliance? How do all the atoms I pull in know to speed up?

77
00:05:10.621 --> 00:05:13.230
And why do they always obey our laws?

78
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.200
Like embodied presences guiding matter around?

79
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.810
No I have with me right now, three things, a lamp,

80
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.950
a nail and a shadow. Gotcha.

81
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.370
I actually have four things with me. The fourth is inks,

82
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.280
astonishing ruler designed by the sauce.

83
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.200
If you're subscribed to the curiosity box,

84
00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:36.330
you already have one or it's on its way to you.

85
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.880
And if you're not subscribed to the curiosity box, well,

86
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.090
you're missing out on the fruits of my mind.

87
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.860
I have always wanted a ruler like this.

88
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.790
So I made one. And now I, and you can have one.

89
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.260
It is exactly one light nanosecond long,

90
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.480
which means that this is the light travels in a vacuum during

91
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.260
1000000000th of a second. If I hold my hand,

92
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.120
just that far away from my eye,

93
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.160
I am seeing my hand as it was a billionth of a second in the past.

94
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.233
Pretty cool.

95
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.590
Now this ruler allows you to measure lengths of things in light picoseconds

96
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.920
sound microseconds, micro Everest's.

97
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:23.810
That's 1000000th of the height of Everest beard, fortnights decimal inches.

98
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:28.490
And of course, good old centimeters. Now, if you ask me, Hey, Mike,

99
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:33.170
why is the shadow of the nail four and a half centimeters long?

100
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.300
Well, I would say who's Mike, but then I would be helpful.

101
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.710
And I would answer that the length of the shadow is caused by the height of the

102
00:06:42.711 --> 00:06:45.080
nail and the position of the light source.

103
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.760
And that's a pretty good explanation because if the nail were taller and or if

104
00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:52.910
the light source were lower, the shadow would be longer.

105
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.330
Or if the nail were shorter and, or the light source was higher,

106
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.920
the shadow would be smaller. Now these three measures, the nails height,

107
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.300
the light's position, and the shadows length are all related. Mathematically,

108
00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:10.190
such that if you gave me only two of them, I could figure out the third always.

109
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.460
So I could declare this relationship to be a law,

110
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.470
but that does not mean that the law causes them to all have the

111
00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:22.400
measure that they do. For example, if you asked me, Hey, um,

112
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.420
why is the nail six centimeters tall?

113
00:07:26.421 --> 00:07:29.420
What causes the nail to have that height? Well, if I said, well,

114
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:33.320
the nails height is caused by the shadows length and the light's position.

115
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.940
You'd be like, uh, as if I'm I, right? I mean, sure.

116
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.840
We can figure out the nails height by knowing about the shadow and the light,

117
00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:45.950
but that does not mean that they are causing the nail to have the height that it

118
00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:49.190
does to know why the nail is six centimeters tall.

119
00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:52.910
We'd have to ask whoever manufactured it or whoever sets nail standards or

120
00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:57.320
whatever. The point here is that we should not confuse relationships.

121
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.880
Laws with causes explanations that involve the

122
00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:05.150
causal reasons for things are often better.

123
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.970
But what is an explanation? Well,

124
00:08:09.971 --> 00:08:13.900
that's easy to answer explanations, help us understand things,

125
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.650
but what does it mean to understand?

126
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.870
Does it mean to not stand up fully or does it mean to stand

127
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:27.640
underneath and to look at from below? If I can understand something,

128
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.820
can I also overstand something well,

129
00:08:30.821 --> 00:08:35.440
as it turns out the under in understand does not mean

130
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.240
beneath or below instead,

131
00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:41.890
it means inside to stand surrounded by,

132
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.240
to be a part of now, this sense of under is quite common. For example,

133
00:08:46.241 --> 00:08:49.840
when you say, well, under those circumstances,

134
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.400
you don't mean well when those circumstances are overhead and I'm under them

135
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:59.370
instead, you mean if I find myself in those circumstances,

136
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.320
and that is how under is used in understand to understand something

137
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:09.510
is to stand in the midst of it, to be part of it and to be within it.

138
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.390
And that is helpful to keep in mind.

139
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:17.310
I cannot walk into something that's crumbled up and closed off to truly

140
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:21.930
understand something. It needs to be opened up for me unfolded.

141
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.900
And that is what an explanation should do.

142
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.360
The word explain literally means to flatten plain out,

143
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.680
ex explain to make flat. Now,

144
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.180
if you'll excuse the analogy,

145
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.480
if this is a story I want to read and it's all crumbled up,

146
00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:42.600
a physical law basically just tells me a summary of the story.

147
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.400
It'll tell me how the story ends,

148
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.850
what language and grammatical rules were used to write it.

149
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:53.310
But an explanation will flatten the page out and allow me

150
00:09:53.311 --> 00:09:58.170
to see the details and actual word and the word that follows it and

151
00:09:58.171 --> 00:10:01.760
so on all the way through. So let's unfold.

152
00:10:01.761 --> 00:10:04.460
The phenomenon of me speeding up my rotation.

153
00:10:04.461 --> 00:10:09.350
When I pull the books in and find a physical mechanical cause for that

154
00:10:09.351 --> 00:10:10.520
increased rotation,

155
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:15.740
I have here two different circular motion paths around the center

156
00:10:15.741 --> 00:10:17.600
of rotation, which we'll call scene.

157
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:23.180
Now when a particle is traveling in this outer ring and is

158
00:10:23.181 --> 00:10:24.350
suddenly pulled in,

159
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:28.550
it doesn't stop moving around and suddenly just go right in.

160
00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.510
Instead it takes a bit of a curved path like this.

161
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.820
Now this is really interesting because in order for a particle to be in circular

162
00:10:37.821 --> 00:10:40.280
motion, it must have two things.

163
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.820
It must have put the particle there.

164
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.590
It must have a velocity that is tangential to the path,

165
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:53.090
but it must also have a centripetal force,

166
00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.680
a center seeking force that always points towards the center of rotation.

167
00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:02.570
Now notice that these two arrows are at a right angle to each other.

168
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:07.490
So the centripetal force is not speeding up or slowing down the

169
00:11:07.491 --> 00:11:12.020
particle. It's just changing its direction, constantly circular motion.

170
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.123
However,

171
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:17.900
when the particle is pulled in and it follows this curved path to this inner

172
00:11:17.901 --> 00:11:18.734
orbit,

173
00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:23.390
it's instantaneous velocity is no longer perpendicular to the

174
00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:27.470
centripetal force. It's a tangential velocity.

175
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.080
Tangent to that curve is going to look something like this.

176
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:35.000
But notice that now the centripetal force is no longer at a right

177
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:35.481
angle.

178
00:11:35.481 --> 00:11:39.200
The force that is changing that particles direction is no longer at a right

179
00:11:39.201 --> 00:11:40.550
angle to its velocity.

180
00:11:40.551 --> 00:11:44.300
Instead if this is the normal to its velocity,

181
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.710
the centripetal force is pulling the particle forward ahead and its rotation

182
00:11:48.711 --> 00:11:52.700
speeding up it's rotation. So as you can see,

183
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.210
I speed up when I pull the books in,

184
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.880
because when I accelerate the books towards myself,

185
00:11:57.881 --> 00:11:59.710
I'm not just accelerating them towards myself.

186
00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:03.190
I'm also accelerating them around. Now. Likewise,

187
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.170
if a particle were to be pushed out

188
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:12.610
from an orbit like this into a larger orbit, it's going to not, uh, you know,

189
00:12:12.611 --> 00:12:14.920
it's not going to do this. It's not going to go, Oh, time to go here.

190
00:12:14.921 --> 00:12:17.350
One straight line. No it's going to go like this. Okay.

191
00:12:17.351 --> 00:12:22.270
I'll go to the larger orbit. But look now on this line,

192
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:28.090
the particles instantaneous velocity is something like this and

193
00:12:28.091 --> 00:12:32.110
the centripetal force is not perpendicular to that line.

194
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:36.940
This is, let me give that a little V Oh yeah. Nice labeling.

195
00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.510
All right. So, Oh wait, now you can see it. Whoops. All right.

196
00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:43.480
So this is the one we're talking about though. This is the one that matters.

197
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:48.910
All right. So the, uh, the, the normal to that velocity might be like this.

198
00:12:48.911 --> 00:12:52.960
So now notice that the centripetal force is actually working against the

199
00:12:52.961 --> 00:12:57.280
velocity of the particle, decelerating it. So of course it slows down.

200
00:12:57.281 --> 00:12:58.870
When I move the books further out,

201
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:03.700
my rotation slows down because moving them out is also decelerating

202
00:13:03.701 --> 00:13:04.241
them. Now,

203
00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:08.620
this is why it is harder to pull your arms in when you're spinning than when

204
00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:11.620
you're not, because you're not just moving your arms into yourself.

205
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.340
You're also accelerating them in the direction of their rotation.

206
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.410
Not only is the magnitude of angular momentum, conserved,

207
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:24.540
so is the direction, but what is the direction of something spin?

208
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.520
What seems easy enough? Right? Look at this.

209
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.710
What's the direction of it's spin clockwise or is it someone standing on the

210
00:13:31.711 --> 00:13:36.600
other side would say that it was traveling counter-clockwise interestingly,

211
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:40.560
this means that if you were to ask the face of a clock, which way its hand spun,

212
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:43.200
it would say counterclockwise, of course,

213
00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.460
in order to unambiguously differentiate the direction of rotation,

214
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:52.230
we need a tool that has no access of symmetry in any of the three spatial

215
00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:56.850
dimensions of our universe. And luckily I've got a tool just like that in here.

216
00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.180
I've been keeping it fresh and Oh,

217
00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:07.410
I could have sworn I, Oh, there it is. It's my right hand.

218
00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.810
A human hand is asymmetrical in the X, Y, and Z directions.

219
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:17.040
We've got thumb, no thumb, wrist,

220
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.760
fingertips Palm knuckles. Now because of this property,

221
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:24.240
if we orient two pairs of opposite sides in a particular way,

222
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.880
the one remaining pair will be locked.

223
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:31.770
Now my fingers could only really curl in the Palm direction on the Palm

224
00:14:31.771 --> 00:14:35.400
side. So if I have my fingertips in the direction

225
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:38.160
of a wheel, spin,

226
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:42.960
curled such that an object on that spinning object travels from my wrist

227
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:47.250
around to my fingertips. Well then my thumb will only point in one direction,

228
00:14:47.251 --> 00:14:51.530
no matter which side I'm on from behind, this is now going clockwise,

229
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:56.150
but the right hand rule is still puts my thumb backwards. That's very cool.

230
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.960
We call the direction that the right-hand thumb is pointing the direction of the

231
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:03.080
wheels, angular momentum, but we could also use the left hand.

232
00:15:03.081 --> 00:15:05.270
We'd get opposite directions than the right hand gives us.

233
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.880
But so long as we all agree to use the same hand,

234
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.540
we will all always be on the same page. But as it turns out, of course,

235
00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:12.950
the right hand was chosen.

236
00:15:12.951 --> 00:15:17.270
And so determining the direction of angular momentum and velocity is called the

237
00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:19.940
use of the right hand rule. Okay.

238
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.760
So now that we know how to find the direction of angular momentum,

239
00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:26.570
we could explore how that part of it is also conserved.

240
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:30.820
I have here a very special wheel. Yeah.

241
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.060
It's pretty crazy looking that's because I wanted it to be really massive.

242
00:15:34.061 --> 00:15:37.870
So I wrapped the chain around it. I'm not sure it's really that safe,

243
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.900
but Oh man is the effect. Good. All right.

244
00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:43.870
Now let's say that I got to use my right hand free.

245
00:15:43.871 --> 00:15:47.200
Let's say that I start spinning the wheel like this,

246
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:51.310
the direction of its angular momentum can be found using the right hand rule.

247
00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:55.570
I curl my fingers in the direction of rotation so that something on the wheel is

248
00:15:55.571 --> 00:15:57.280
going from my wrist to my fingertips.

249
00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.010
And I look at which way my thumb is pointing was pointing up.

250
00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.710
Let's call up the positive direction.

251
00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:06.130
I don't know the magnitude of the angular momentum of the wheel right now.

252
00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:10.060
It's some number. Um, but let's just call it out. And since it's up,

253
00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:12.190
we'll call it positive. I could call it negative.

254
00:16:12.191 --> 00:16:14.680
All that matters is that I can differentiate, uh,

255
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.410
one direction from the opposite. All right, wonderful.

256
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.140
So notice that if I spun the wheel this way,

257
00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.650
I'd have to turn my right hand over to curl my fingers properly.

258
00:16:23.651 --> 00:16:26.020
Now my thumb is pointing down. So this would be negative.

259
00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.210
Let's call the magnitude of this wheels.

260
00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:33.100
Angular momentum Al positive L well,

261
00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:38.050
if I got the wheel spinning so that it had an angular momentum of

262
00:16:38.051 --> 00:16:41.380
positive L if I then turned it upside down,

263
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.350
its angular momentum will have changed direction.

264
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:48.400
It would have swapped from being positive to negative L however,

265
00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.140
if nothing else is interfering,

266
00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:53.680
that can't happen without angular momentum being conserved.

267
00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:58.690
So what plus negative L is positive

268
00:16:58.691 --> 00:17:01.720
L our original, well positive two L.

269
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.150
That is what we will see happen.

270
00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:09.310
If I spin this wheel like this such that it has an angular momentum

271
00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.970
of positive L and then I turn it upside down.

272
00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:18.010
Something else will have to have an angular momentum of positive two L.

273
00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:21.610
So like, imagine my thumb being twice as long. What is that? Something else?

274
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.760
Well, it'll be me and the chair is this very cool.

275
00:17:24.761 --> 00:17:26.620
So let's make sure we know what's about to happen.

276
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:30.850
I'm going to spin the wheel this way, then I'm going to turn it upside down.

277
00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:36.010
And so I'm going to see myself in the chair, wind up rotating this way.

278
00:17:36.011 --> 00:17:37.660
I'll rotate that way. All right.

279
00:17:37.661 --> 00:17:40.780
So what I'm going to do is have Scott step in and give this wheel a nice,

280
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.360
healthy spin in that direction.

281
00:17:43.361 --> 00:17:47.620
So it has an angular momentum of positive L I'll take my foot off the ground

282
00:17:47.621 --> 00:17:50.730
when he's done. So I'm more or less isolated system,

283
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:55.170
and I'll turn the wheel upside down and I should go that way. Whoa,

284
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.640
angular momentum is conserved. That's pretty cool.

285
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:03.960
But the conservation of angular momentum either its magnitude or,

286
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:12.330
or its direction is not Y turning the wheel upside down,

287
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.650
spun me this way. Website kicked my empty to cup, uh,

288
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:21.090
container. Anyway, what caused me to move? Well,

289
00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.720
if you do this yourself, you will feel the handles of the wheel.

290
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.630
Literally pushing you, putting a torque on your body.

291
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:32.460
And it has everything to do with a concept I've covered in my spinning video and

292
00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.040
my video on Dean about Oilers disc.

293
00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:39.840
If the wheel isn't spinning and I push it down right here, it'll tilt like that,

294
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:43.350
right? Not very surprising. That's the kind of tilt we would expect.

295
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.830
But when the wheel is spinning, all the piece of matter out here, well,

296
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:50.490
they all have some velocity before I hit them. For example,

297
00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:54.210
when a piece of matter on the wheel is out here, it's moving backwards.

298
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.810
And when I push it down, it doesn't suddenly stop moving backwards.

299
00:18:57.811 --> 00:18:59.640
The wheel doesn't stop. Instead,

300
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:03.990
the pieces I'm pushing are now going to go backwards as they already were and

301
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.180
down. So they go backwards and down,

302
00:19:06.181 --> 00:19:10.110
and then they come back up and the entire wheel is found to tilt this way

303
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.860
towards me, 90 degrees ahead,

304
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.010
from where I actually pushed it down, a push down here,

305
00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.290
causes the wheel to move like this.

306
00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:23.430
A push down here would cause the wheel to tilt like this.

307
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.000
A push up here would cause the wheel to tilt.

308
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:32.160
Like let's see 90 degrees ahead in the rotation like this and

309
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:36.990
this. And this is exactly what I'm doing when I turn the wheel upside down.

310
00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:40.680
So when I put a torque on the wheel to turn it while it's spinning, like this,

311
00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:44.760
the wheel actually turns this way, but I have two hands holding it.

312
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.850
My left hand winds up getting pushed backwards.

313
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.750
And my right hand pulled forwards. That puts a torque on my body,

314
00:19:51.751 --> 00:19:55.050
which causes me being pushed back here and pulled forward here.

315
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:58.710
It causes me to be turned. And so I turn this way,

316
00:19:58.711 --> 00:20:00.750
the way that we saw in the demo in the chair,

317
00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:05.520
and that is the physical origin of the phenomenon. We just witnessed.

318
00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:09.860
The key point here is that nothing you have seen happen today happened because

319
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:11.810
of the conservation of angular momentum,

320
00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:15.380
physical laws don't cause anything to happen,

321
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:18.740
but plenty of things are demonstrations of their them truth.

322
00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.670
Now don't get me wrong. I love physical laws.

323
00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:26.990
They truly do represent a conquering of mystery.

324
00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:32.240
When we find a way to project definite numbers onto reality and make

325
00:20:32.241 --> 00:20:34.250
predictions. That's amazing,

326
00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:39.620
but not coupled with causal mechanical physical explanations there,

327
00:20:39.621 --> 00:20:44.120
generality can come across like magic. Now magic is fun for sure,

328
00:20:44.121 --> 00:20:48.910
but congruences between mathematics and Oh,

329
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:54.760
and that's a sweet nectar in mathematics, we get to make the rules,

330
00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:59.260
pick the axioms. We can even decide what kinds of reasoning are allowed or not.

331
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:02.320
And after doing so, we get to play around and see what happens.

332
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.590
Mathematics is the plane of games.

333
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:10.990
Science is finding out what game you're playing and we still don't

334
00:21:10.991 --> 00:21:13.480
know what game we have found ourselves in,

335
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:18.790
but we should keep wondering and never be happy until we get answers that

336
00:21:18.791 --> 00:21:23.050
satisfy us, stay curious and as always.

337
00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:24.743
<v 0>Thanks for watching.</v>

338
00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:40.950
<v 1>I have some pretty exciting news to share with you as of today for the rest of</v>

339
00:21:40.951 --> 00:21:44.970
the year, every single episode of minefield, all three seasons,

340
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.290
all 24 episodes,

341
00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:50.310
we'll be free to view all around the world.

342
00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:54.510
I am thrilled. So go and check those out.

343
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:55.980
There's a very special, well,

344
00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:59.190
actually two very special things coming on this channel this month,

345
00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.530
can't wait for you to see them in the meantime,

346
00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:06.360
if you need more of me and I always need more of me check out, ding,

347
00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:09.630
I've done about 15 videos this year over there. It's a blast.

348
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.620
We learn a lot over there and things often get a little bit weird, you know,

349
00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:17.970
I guess maybe I don't know, check it out and find out and as always,

350
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:18.840
thanks for watching.
