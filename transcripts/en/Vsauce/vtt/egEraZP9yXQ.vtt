00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.800
<v 0>Hey, Michael ear, come on in.</v>

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.920
If you keep going, you will eventually emerge out my other end.

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.520
And for this reason, it has been said that the human body is like a donut.

4
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.600
Yeah. You are just a bunch of meat packed around a central hole,

5
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.340
or are you humans have more than one hole, right? I mean,

6
00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:30.810
we've got nostrils and ears.

7
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.560
The whole sweet pea out of the holes were born from nipples. Our pores.

8
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.930
There are subatomic gaps between the molecules were made out of where don't we

9
00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:43.710
have holes. Well, that is the rub.

10
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.480
Literally

11
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.250
cut a clove of garlic in half, and then rub that fresh,

12
00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:58.850
raw end on your foot. About an hour later,

13
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.420
you will start to taste garlic in your mouth.

14
00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.370
That's because the molecules that give garlic its taste are small enough and

15
00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:11.210
have just the right properties to permeate skin cells in your foot,

16
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.000
enter your bloodstream and reach your mouth.

17
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.820
But you are even holier than Matt every second day

18
00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:20.330
and night,

19
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.280
about 60 billion neutrinos from the sun pass through just your

20
00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:29.090
thumbnail. So clearly at small enough scales,

21
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.650
how many holes does a human have becomes a meaningless question. Ultimately,

22
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.340
the human body, isn't a solid thing that can even have holes.

23
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.430
It's just a loose constellation of atoms and molecules.

24
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.510
But if we accept a minimum hole size,

25
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.430
the answer becomes pretty interesting.

26
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.710
And a good choice for this minimum is about 20 to 60 millionths of a meter

27
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.520
about the width of a human hair, a magic spaceship,

28
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.430
60 microns wide could fly into your pores.

29
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.920
Like they were giant holes that craters,

30
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.320
but it couldn't continue on through the vasculature at the other end or diffuse

31
00:02:06.321 --> 00:02:10.520
through cells or slip between molecules. And that is significant.

32
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.330
It highlights the fact that not all holes are equal.

33
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.340
A 60 micron wide ship or stream could be threaded into your

34
00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:21.350
mouth and come out somewhere else.

35
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.370
But it couldn't do that by entering a poor or hair follicle.

36
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.930
This makes the GI tract,

37
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.220
what engineers call a through-hole whereas pores

38
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.670
urethras nipples, ears, hair follicles, birth canals,

39
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.420
and the sinuses are blind holes. They can be entered,

40
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.070
but eventually dead end,

41
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.990
usually at narrow capillaries permeable only by things smaller than a single

42
00:02:44.991 --> 00:02:48.020
blood cell and the determination to not be stopped.

43
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.630
The eyeball can be squeezed under,

44
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.570
but you'll eventually be stopped by the conjunctiva.

45
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.140
The sinuses are nice big rooms in our skulls,

46
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.200
but the only way out is the same ostia you came in through as for

47
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:05.770
the ear. Well, the ear is a blast to go inside,

48
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:07.360
but if you're 60 microns wide,

49
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.990
the airtight eardrum will block further passage.

50
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:15.700
It's a blind hole now altogether counting all of your pores and hair follicles.

51
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.660
You've got millions of blind holes all over your body,

52
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.050
but are they actually holes?

53
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.370
That's a real humdinger because you know what a hole is, what,

54
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.880
what a hole really is. It's a word,

55
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.370
a colloquial fuzzy imprecise Lexium that refers to a

56
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:37.840
host of disparate,

57
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.880
utterly unreconcilable things that alludes a single precise mathematical

58
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:44.920
definition. In fact,

59
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.660
holes might not even exist. I mean, think about it.

60
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.640
If I eat a whole donut, have I eaten the whole, like,

61
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.740
is the hole inside me? Or could I eat a donut without eating its hole?

62
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.970
Could I go to a store and buy Swiss cheese,

63
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.280
but leave the holes at the store.

64
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.330
Clearly holes are at best ontologically parasitic

65
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.070
there distance depends upon the existence of something else that they can

66
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.400
inhabit or be a disturbance in.

67
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.870
Of course the philosophy of holes rarely matters in your day to day life.

68
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.530
You can call something a hole and context will do its work and people will know

69
00:04:28.531 --> 00:04:30.840
what you're talking about, but take a look at this.

70
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.420
Does this have a hole in it? Well, yeah, right. Obviously right here,

71
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.660
there's a hole. I can put my hand in it. It can store things. It's got a hole,

72
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.940
but now imagine that I could mold it like it was made out of clay and I molded

73
00:04:44.941 --> 00:04:49.500
it down into the shape of a drinking glass. You could see how that could happen.

74
00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:52.470
Right? Well, does a drinking glass have a hole in it?

75
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.170
If this does then this should too, right? I mean,

76
00:04:55.171 --> 00:04:59.760
I didn't pinch the hole shut or glue anything together. I sure.

77
00:04:59.761 --> 00:05:03.600
Fine. I mean, I can accept that a drinking glass technically has a hole in it,

78
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.030
but now imagine that I took this glass and I molded it out and I widened

79
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.930
its opening until I had a shape like this, a bowl.

80
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.570
Now does a bowl have a hole in it?

81
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.020
Now we're really stretching the use of the word whole. I mean,

82
00:05:19.021 --> 00:05:20.700
if someone said their bowl had a hole in it,

83
00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:25.170
I would think that it had a hole somewhere else and it was leaking, but sure.

84
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.810
Let's call this a hole. It's not a very prototypical one,

85
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.730
but I think you see where I'm going with this.

86
00:05:29.731 --> 00:05:34.260
If I didn't molded the bowl and flattened it sides all the way out until I had

87
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.510
a plate, a shape like this, well, does a plate have a hole in it?

88
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.310
Not really. So if a plate doesn't have a hole in it,

89
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.230
but this shape did. And I continuously molded from here,

90
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.250
the glass to the bowl,

91
00:05:50.251 --> 00:05:54.030
to the plate and I never glued anything shut where'd the hole go.

92
00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.710
Clearly, blind holes are unique.

93
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.000
They can be removed without closing or pinching anything. Shut.

94
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.950
Compare that to the through hole of a donut.

95
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:12.200
There is no way to remove a donuts through hole or add a new through

96
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:15.350
hole without gluing stuff together,

97
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.550
squishing things together that used to not be together or ripping pieces apart,

98
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.380
poking a hole through and breaking it.

99
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.540
That is extremely significant, but let's go back to the body.

100
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.590
Before we get ahead of ourselves,

101
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.010
the mouth is an entrance to both blind and through holes,

102
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.290
eight 60 micron wide traveler could enter it meander down the esophagus and

103
00:06:41.291 --> 00:06:44.410
keep going until they were well dumped out,

104
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.490
but turn down the trachea and they would dead end in the lungs.

105
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.570
Now the area of the throat behind the mouth is called the pharynx.

106
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.370
It's a pretty chill place, except not really. It's actually quite warm.

107
00:06:57.371 --> 00:07:01.600
It plays a role in warming and moistening and filtering the air that we breathe

108
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.070
before it enters the lungs,

109
00:07:03.071 --> 00:07:07.000
including the air we inhale through our nostrils.

110
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.690
Now each nostril leads into a separate nasal vestibule.

111
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.990
That's the tunnel that you can explore when you pick your nose.

112
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:19.060
Eventually those tunnels meet and sniffed air enters the nasal cavity,

113
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:22.060
a hollow air filled room in your face.

114
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.920
Protruding from the walls of the nasal cavity are mucusy fins called the nasal

115
00:07:26.921 --> 00:07:31.000
conky or terminates that warm and moisten the air that passes around them.

116
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.140
From there, the air flows via the pharynx down the trachea.

117
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:38.710
So your nostrils and your mouth are connected.

118
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.970
A string could go into your mouth or nose and come out your,

119
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.720
but the nasal cavity is quite the hub.

120
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.260
I mean your ear holes would almost lead into it. Uh,

121
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.690
but the eardrum blocks the way. If it didn't,

122
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.270
there would be clear passage from the outside,

123
00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:00.280
into the middle ear and then down the U station tube into the nasal cavity

124
00:08:00.281 --> 00:08:02.560
via an opening about here,

125
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:06.880
the eustachian tube controls air pressure in the middle ear behind the eardrum

126
00:08:06.881 --> 00:08:09.010
and is normally collapsed, shut.

127
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.850
But if the outside pressure is dramatically different than the air pressure in

128
00:08:12.851 --> 00:08:13.810
the middle ear,

129
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.610
swallowing and yawning can gape it open equalizing the pressure.

130
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:23.200
That's what happens when you pop your ears. It's cool,

131
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.960
but it's not a through-hole and that's what we're looking for.

132
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.290
And as it turns out, there are four more,

133
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:33.730
four more orifices that lead from the outside, into this place,

134
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.720
your nasal cavity, and they are the lacrimal puncta.

135
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:42.010
There is one near each of your eyelids. They're tiny openings,

136
00:08:42.011 --> 00:08:44.860
about a third of a millimeter wide into which tears,

137
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.820
the fluid constantly moistening and protecting your eyeball drain.

138
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:53.050
Once inside the lacquer will puncta tears flow through nasal lack,

139
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:56.790
remote ducts tear ducts into your nasal cavity,

140
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:58.780
which is why when you're making.

141
00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.770
<v 1>Oh, a lot of tear fluid sniffly,</v>

142
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.600
and have to blow your nose. That's not snack.

143
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.850
<v 0>That's mainly tears.</v>

144
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.620
The point is a 60 micron wide string could be pushed into any of your,

145
00:09:15.621 --> 00:09:18.380
for lack rumble. Puncta threaded through your tear,

146
00:09:18.381 --> 00:09:20.780
ducts into your nasal cavity, into the pharynx,

147
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.290
and then pushed all the way out your butt. Pretty cool.

148
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.760
That gives us eight external openings that don't dead end.

149
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:33.350
But how many through holes is that? I mean,

150
00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:38.810
how many holes does a straw have? This clearly has two holes,

151
00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:43.460
but how many does this have? Is it one hole that forks?

152
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:48.170
Is it two that combine? Gosh, maybe it's three. Well, what about this?

153
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:51.170
How many holes does this thing have? Or this

154
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:57.290
topology can help us answer every single one of those questions here.

155
00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.530
I have two essentially identical pieces of material.

156
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:11.300
<v 1>Okay?</v>

157
00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.610
<v 0>Now they are no longer identical</v>

158
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.100
or are they geometrically shore?

159
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.780
Their shapes are now different, but what didn't change about them? Well,

160
00:10:23.781 --> 00:10:28.550
that is what topology studies topology is concerned with the properties that

161
00:10:28.551 --> 00:10:32.300
persist so long as something isn't ripped apart.

162
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:36.320
The famous joke that a topologist doesn't know the difference between a donut

163
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.550
and a coffee cup is based on the fact that a coffee cup can be gently,

164
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:44.900
continuously molded into a donut by simply stretching and squashing,

165
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.640
no cutting gluing ripping or sewing required topology.

166
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:54.980
Let's call these gentle continuous transformations, homeo, morphism,

167
00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.840
and the cutting and ripping and gluing that they

168
00:10:59.841 --> 00:11:04.730
disallow are exactly the kinds of actions required to make new holes or

169
00:11:04.731 --> 00:11:09.440
remove old ones. So since a coffee cup and a donut are homeo morphic,

170
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.880
they must have the same number of through holes and they do one.

171
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:18.140
We can now more precisely described the difference we saw earlier between blind

172
00:11:18.141 --> 00:11:22.130
holes and through holes and understand why we are separately. Counting them.

173
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:27.380
Now blind holes can be erased through a homeo morphism as such

174
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:29.780
topology lists don't even really consider them.

175
00:11:29.781 --> 00:11:33.560
They're just geometric disturbances. Topological holes.

176
00:11:33.561 --> 00:11:38.420
On the other hand cannot be massaged away and unlike a blind

177
00:11:38.421 --> 00:11:42.170
hole where what qualifies and what doesn't is a matter of opinion,

178
00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.610
the number of through holes, a surface like your body in three dimensions has,

179
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.010
can be clearly defined.

180
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:52.100
If we are having a hard time counting through holes,

181
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:56.200
all we need to is find something with an easy to count arrangement of through

182
00:11:56.201 --> 00:11:58.660
holes that it is homeo morphic with.

183
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.460
But first let's play around with some topological puzzles.

184
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:08.430
Here is a to hold donut with an infinitely long unbreakable unmovable rod

185
00:12:08.431 --> 00:12:13.350
through one it's holes without cutting or separating any part of

186
00:12:13.351 --> 00:12:16.260
the shape. Can you figure out how to manipulate it?

187
00:12:16.261 --> 00:12:20.340
Such that the rod goes through both holes, pause the video.

188
00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.480
If you want to think about it,

189
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:28.170
remember this shape, it looks like it might have three holes, right?

190
00:12:28.171 --> 00:12:31.680
It's got a hole there, a second hole there and a third hole here.

191
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:36.090
But if I flatten it, you can see that it only has two holes. It has one there.

192
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.870
And one there. If the rod is threaded through the shape,

193
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:44.280
such that one wire is in front and I choose one of the other wires to be the

194
00:12:44.281 --> 00:12:46.530
middle of the donut. For example, this one,

195
00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:50.490
then the rod passes through just one of the two holes.

196
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.840
But if I choose the wire in the front to be the middle of the donut,

197
00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.650
well then the rod is seen to be passing through two holes.

198
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:05.310
If you continuously deformed our original two whole donut into the three

199
00:13:05.311 --> 00:13:09.120
tube thing and pick this tube to be the new middle Tara,

200
00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:12.570
the rod is now going through two holes,

201
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.570
no cutting or gluing required.

202
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:20.370
One more puzzle without cutting or breaking. Can you unlock this shapes?

203
00:13:20.371 --> 00:13:24.120
Intertwined loops. Well, pause. If you want to figure it out yourself,

204
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.950
here's a solution.

205
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:30.270
Simply inflate the bulb of the shape until you can skate a leg of each loop

206
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.290
around until they're untangled and Tuttle freedom.

207
00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:38.370
All right, let's do I find homeo morphism a little better?

208
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:43.140
We said it was a rubber sheet or clay like molding procedure with no

209
00:13:43.141 --> 00:13:46.650
cutting or breaking or gluing. And that's a good introduction,

210
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.540
but honestly you can cut all you want during a homeo morphism.

211
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.960
So long as you glue everything back together,

212
00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.720
the way it was in the end, more,

213
00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:02.220
more precisely a homeo morphism is a by generative and by

214
00:14:02.221 --> 00:14:04.470
continuous function,

215
00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:09.210
it's a function because it is a list of ordered pairs where each point starts is

216
00:14:09.211 --> 00:14:13.770
paired with where it goes requiring that it be a projection means that it must

217
00:14:13.771 --> 00:14:16.020
be a special kind of function,

218
00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:20.250
where there is a one to one correspondence between points in one object.

219
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.330
And in the other,

220
00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:25.860
no two points can map to the same location and no point can get magically turned

221
00:14:25.861 --> 00:14:27.120
into multiple new points.

222
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.650
Basically material cannot be added or subtracted by

223
00:14:31.651 --> 00:14:35.970
continuous means that any cuts made must be later mended

224
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:40.830
perfectly with points going back amongst the same neighboring points they had

225
00:14:40.831 --> 00:14:45.420
before in a homie. Amorphism if parts are scooched over,

226
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.420
everything else must flow with the scooch.

227
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.970
As if all the points are kind of sticky.

228
00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.890
There is no smooth sliding along abrupt fissures.

229
00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:59.930
The precise test for whether a function is by continuous is pretty cool.

230
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:00.920
At first,

231
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.360
I consider a point in one arrangement now where the function takes that point is

232
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.620
its image. Okay?

233
00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:11.150
Now I choose some neighborhood around the image with a radius larger than

234
00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:13.730
zero, and I consider all of the points within it.

235
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.210
If the function is continuous in this direction,

236
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.560
I should be able to find a neighborhood around the pre-image the input point

237
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:26.540
that only contains points that map inside the images neighborhood

238
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.200
in this case I can, but in this case,

239
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:32.840
we've got an original point and where it went,

240
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:35.420
but given a neighborhood around where it went,

241
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.370
every neighborhood around the original,

242
00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:42.200
no matter how small will always contain some stuff that didn't make it

243
00:15:42.201 --> 00:15:46.220
over, which means points got separated, but not put back.

244
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:51.200
So the function is not continuous by continuity means

245
00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:55.160
that a function must be continuous in both directions. Okay?

246
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:59.720
Now that we can homie a mortifies, let's start using it to count holes.

247
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:01.250
Remember this shape,

248
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:05.930
it wasn't immediately obvious earlier how to count its holes, but it is easy.

249
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:09.140
If we can use a homeo morphism to turn it into something,

250
00:16:09.141 --> 00:16:12.500
with an easy to count number of holes, which we can,

251
00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.720
both of these shapes are homeo, morphic.

252
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:19.280
They both have two holes to see why simply drag and

253
00:16:19.281 --> 00:16:24.200
mold and flow the opening of one of the shapes holes into

254
00:16:24.201 --> 00:16:27.350
the tunnel of the other. And there we go,

255
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:31.520
since we didn't cut or glue the number of holes hasn't changed.

256
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:36.110
So this thing just like this thing always had two holes.

257
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:41.180
Okay. What about a straw? Well, short informally, it can often make sense,

258
00:16:41.181 --> 00:16:46.130
depending on the context to differentiate between two openings in a straw,

259
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:49.190
the one you put in your drink and the one you put in your mouth,

260
00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.180
but that does not mean it has two holes. It only has one.

261
00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.330
A straw is homie amorphic to a Taurus.

262
00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.750
Both openings are part of the same single hole,

263
00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:04.610
but this process is a homeo morphism, and thus does not create any new holes.

264
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:06.440
You can also see that openings.

265
00:17:06.441 --> 00:17:10.790
Aren't holes by stretching one of the straws openings until it becomes the outer

266
00:17:10.791 --> 00:17:15.020
part of a donut. There really was only ever just one hole,

267
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:19.040
but enough about straws. Let's get back to the body.

268
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.190
We found eight external openings,

269
00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:26.780
orifices interconnected by tunnels, but openings. Aren't holes.

270
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:31.850
They're parts of holes, and we can count those holes.

271
00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.180
As it turns out at a scale of 60 microns,

272
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:39.130
the human body has seven through holes.

273
00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:44.260
The human body is not a donut. It is a seven hold donut.

274
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:49.620
This shape can be molded and stretched into you. First.

275
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:54.510
We choose a whole to be the GI tract, the mouth anus tunnel. Now into this,

276
00:17:54.511 --> 00:17:56.910
we roll half of the other orifices. Okay?

277
00:17:56.911 --> 00:17:58.920
Now we've got something that looks pretty dang,

278
00:17:58.921 --> 00:18:03.480
human seven holes with eight external orifices that meet in a common space.

279
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.340
The nasal cavity, if we squish all the matter in towards the tunnels,

280
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:13.050
we'll notice that our seven hold Taurus is top logically equivalent to four

281
00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:17.250
pairs of pants sewn together at the wastes, your body.

282
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:22.110
Isn't a donut. It's a body suit for a spider. Okay. Now to finish,

283
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:27.180
let's make two of the legs, the nostrils, and four of them, the tear ducks,

284
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.110
one, the mouth and inflate the material into the form of a head.

285
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:35.040
Now let's inflate the boundary of the final tube into the shape of a body with

286
00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:37.220
its opening in the rear. And we've done it.

287
00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:47.540
The human body is a seven hold donut,

288
00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:53.840
or is it for every piercing you have that's one more

289
00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:56.960
hole in your body. Well, two more,

290
00:18:56.961 --> 00:19:00.380
if the piercing goes through a through hole, like, I don't know if you had a,

291
00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:04.880
a thin piercing into your face that went through a tear duct and came back out,

292
00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.270
or if, uh, something like a bullet pierced into your chest,

293
00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.990
through your esophagus and came out the other side that would mathematically

294
00:19:11.991 --> 00:19:16.910
count as two new holes. And there's more,

295
00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:22.040
some people have supernumerary lack remote puncta on their eyes.

296
00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:26.780
Each additional punctum they have over four total adds an additional hole to the

297
00:19:26.781 --> 00:19:27.740
standard seven.

298
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:33.710
And remember the sinuses and the ostia connecting them into the nasal

299
00:19:33.711 --> 00:19:36.380
cavity. Well, they're just blind holes, depressions,

300
00:19:36.381 --> 00:19:40.610
but as many as half of us may have at least one

301
00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:45.530
accessory ostium and extra hole connecting a sinus to the nasal

302
00:19:45.531 --> 00:19:48.020
cavity. Well, now we're talking about a through hole.

303
00:19:48.021 --> 00:19:51.260
You can enter one opening and exit via another.

304
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:56.510
Now these may not be external orifices, but for every accessory osteo you have,

305
00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:00.770
that's another top illogical hole you need to add to your body's total.

306
00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:06.440
The thing is though most of us have no idea how many accessory ostia we have

307
00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:11.060
unless you've had serious sinus problems or have had extensive scans of your

308
00:20:11.061 --> 00:20:13.790
nasal region that have been studied from multiple angles.

309
00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.850
So to answer this video's question,

310
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:21.350
the human body has millions of blind holes,

311
00:20:21.351 --> 00:20:25.880
like at least 5 million. And at birth seven through holes,

312
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:31.100
it would be better if there was a clear answer that applied to all of us for our

313
00:20:31.101 --> 00:20:32.150
entire lives,

314
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:36.590
or if finding out how many you had right now was easier,

315
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:40.310
but you'll have to speed. Lunken your sinuses to know for sure.

316
00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:42.200
And that's beautiful, isn't it?

317
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:47.560
We can rigorously define the properties of holes in all sorts

318
00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:48.311
of dimensions.

319
00:20:48.311 --> 00:20:51.940
And we can study the temperatures at the bottom of craters on Pluto,

320
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:56.530
but few of us will ever truly know the whole

321
00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.460
truth of our own bodies. And as always,

322
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:02.043
thanks for watching.

323
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:16.440
