00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.570
<v 0>The sauce, Kevin here. And I'm an idiot.</v>

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.660
I am the Duke of the dull and dumb witted.

3
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.480
I am breathtakingly brainless.

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.920
I am fabulously fat headed disastrously doltish and

5
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:16.320
confoundingly prejudice.

6
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.790
I've spent 10 years making hundreds of videos,

7
00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:23.010
celebrating knowledge and creativity.

8
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.260
I've highlighted the achievements of some of the smartest minds in science

9
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.150
and math. I've learned a lot along the way, and maybe you have too,

10
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.310
but for the last few weeks I've been pursuing peak

11
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:43.200
stupidity and, uh, it's going pretty well.

12
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.360
The fact is I hope this video makes you dumber because

13
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.580
sometimes being an idiot is the difference between life and death.

14
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.390
<v 1>Here's how, hold on. I got to get this barbecue sauce off my face.</v>

15
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.070
It's like literally burning my skin. Okay. Hang on. Oh, this is for a child.

16
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.340
Okay. I am going to smell like barbecue sauce for the rest of this video,

17
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.600
but it's what I do for you. Okay. Here's how.

18
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.030
<v 0>In 1942 psychologist,</v>

19
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.040
Alexander Lutens administered a problem-solving test using water and

20
00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:23.630
differently sized jars.

21
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.160
The goal is to fill and empty those jars with water in a

22
00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:30.770
combination to get the desired volume.

23
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.480
You've got an unlimited supply of water and you can throw out as much as you

24
00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:38.210
want in problem. Number one, jar,

25
00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:43.040
a holds 29 ounces and jar B holds three ounces.

26
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.770
The goal is to measure 20 ounces.

27
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.570
So you'd fill the 29 ounce jar and use that to fill the

28
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:55.400
three ounce jar three times 29, minus three, minus three,

29
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.700
minus three, leaving you with 20 ounces.

30
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.770
This is not a paradox problem to as a third jar.

31
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.520
This time jar a is 21 ounces jar.

32
00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:12.080
B is 127 and GRC is three ounces.

33
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.030
We have to get to 100 ounces and that's also pretty

34
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:17.570
easy.

35
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.490
127 minus 21 minus three minus three

36
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.390
equals 100. The third problem is a little bit trickier,

37
00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:29.660
but now we know how to solve these jar.

38
00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:31.730
A holds 14 ounces,

39
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.040
GRP holds 163 and juror C holds 25

40
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.580
ounces. Your goal is to get 99 ounces.

41
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.580
You can fill the 163,

42
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.620
then pour two 20 fives and one 14 for

43
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:53.600
163 minus 25 minus 25 minus 14 equals hour

44
00:02:53.601 --> 00:02:58.250
99. Once you're locked into the successful strategy,

45
00:02:58.251 --> 00:03:00.070
your on autopilot,

46
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.110
fill the biggest jar and use the other two smaller jars to read it,

47
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.780
deuce it until you've got the right amount. It all right,

48
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.210
one more jar,

49
00:03:12.211 --> 00:03:17.190
a holds 23 ounces jar B holds 49 ounces

50
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.020
jar C holds three ounces. We need 20 ounces.

51
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.490
So 49 minus 23, minus three,

52
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.170
minus three equals 20. Right? Well,

53
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.770
yeah, actually that is, that is right,

54
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.550
but it's not the most efficient solution.

55
00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:43.050
We could just fill jar a with 23 ounces and then pour three

56
00:03:43.051 --> 00:03:47.340
ounces into GRC and have the 20 ounces that we need

57
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:48.570
this time.

58
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.310
We don't need this largest jar and all learning an algorithm to

59
00:03:53.311 --> 00:03:57.900
solve these problems actually made us a bit

60
00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.393
stupider.

61
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.320
Lutyens found that after giving six problems that involve filling the largest

62
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.420
jar B and then taking away different amounts using jar a and jar

63
00:04:09.421 --> 00:04:14.160
C the research subjects were locked into using all

64
00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:16.890
three jars to solve each problem.

65
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.060
They didn't even see the simpler solution.

66
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.370
The final problem, 28,

67
00:04:23.371 --> 00:04:27.810
76 and three with a goal of 25 could only be solved

68
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.490
efficiently by using the two smaller jars, 28 minus three.

69
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.770
Many of the subjects tried to apply their algorithm and immediately said

70
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.940
the problem was impossible, impossible.

71
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.460
They gained too much knowledge. They were too experienced.

72
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.560
They'd become so smart that they got stupid.

73
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.860
Welcome to the Einstein long effect.

74
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.560
Unschooling is a German word that roughly translates as mindset.

75
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.660
It describes the overall method and frame of reference for solving a

76
00:05:06.661 --> 00:05:09.510
problem. When Lou chins conducted his experiment,

77
00:05:09.511 --> 00:05:14.220
he gave a second group that problem that contains two possible

78
00:05:14.221 --> 00:05:17.040
solutions as their very first task.

79
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.020
Most of them instantly recognized the simpler solution because

80
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.030
they weren't trapped in the big jar method of thinking about the

81
00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:30.420
problem. It wasn't that group B was smarter.

82
00:05:30.421 --> 00:05:35.250
It was that group a had learned just enough to make them

83
00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.410
dumber. Oh,

84
00:05:37.411 --> 00:05:41.640
and some of the people who were shown the simpler solution after they declared

85
00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:46.350
the final problem was impossible. They got mad.

86
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.600
Like they got really,

87
00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.220
really mad in his paper mechanization in problem solving Lutyens wrote

88
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.361
realizing it.

89
00:05:54.361 --> 00:05:59.150
He is embarrassed by the blindness and stupidity showed while solving them

90
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.051
puzzles,

91
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:05.030
how it was possible and feels shame at having been blinded to such a degree

92
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.810
rendered.

93
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.250
So incapable of reasonable action of intelligent

94
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.390
procedures,

95
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.550
basically some were upset that they felt dumb and then

96
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:21.470
decided to take that anger out on the experiment itself

97
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.760
in a footnote Lutyens explains instead of viewing their

98
00:06:25.761 --> 00:06:29.390
responses as stupid. Some of these subjects remarked,

99
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.040
heatedly that the tasks or the instructions were

100
00:06:34.041 --> 00:06:34.874
stupid.

101
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.600
They were embarrassed because they felt stupid and they

102
00:06:40.601 --> 00:06:43.990
felt stupid because they were too smart.

103
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.850
They'd have been smarter if they were stupider, it's,

104
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:55.030
it's a vicious cycle. The lung effect is a serious cognitive force.

105
00:06:55.031 --> 00:06:59.320
And it's so strong that when a similar experiment used eye tracking

106
00:06:59.321 --> 00:07:04.090
software to show whether expert chess players could recognize a simple

107
00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:07.930
solution after a specific series of moves,

108
00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.170
they literally did not even see it,

109
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.570
their brains wouldn't let them see it kind of like how

110
00:07:16.571 --> 00:07:20.860
you can't see that my face is not flat.

111
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.060
This is actually a concave photo of my face.

112
00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:29.560
As you can see what I turn it. This is not at all a flat image,

113
00:07:29.561 --> 00:07:34.270
but when seeing straight on your brain automatically fills in

114
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.400
that hollow shape and projects it outward because it's programmed

115
00:07:39.401 --> 00:07:41.230
to see faces that way.

116
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.480
Grand illusions has a hollow face Einstein masks that really shows

117
00:07:46.481 --> 00:07:51.280
just how biased our visual systems are in favor of seeing

118
00:07:51.281 --> 00:07:54.430
faces as convex your brain.

119
00:07:54.431 --> 00:07:58.960
Won't allow you to see the hollow face for the concave shape.

120
00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:03.370
It truly is because it's shortcut supersedes

121
00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:07.510
reality. It's why the phrase I can't unsee.

122
00:08:07.511 --> 00:08:11.800
It exists in the first place. Here's a different example.

123
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:13.683
Excuse me,

124
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:19.390
there's an old riddle about a plane crashing or a Starship enterprise

125
00:08:19.391 --> 00:08:24.220
crashing on an international border and being asked where

126
00:08:24.221 --> 00:08:26.440
to bury the survivors.

127
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.700
Your brain gets so wrapped up in processing. What, you know,

128
00:08:30.701 --> 00:08:35.020
that a country's borders could be relevant in determining how to deal with the

129
00:08:35.021 --> 00:08:39.430
situation that a certain number of people died in the

130
00:08:39.431 --> 00:08:44.170
crash. And all the other details were used to thinking about that.

131
00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.570
It takes a minute to realize that survivors don't have to be

132
00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:50.980
buried at all.

133
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:56.310
The [inaudible] effect has created a short term illusion.

134
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:01.290
That turns a simple obvious scenario into a ridiculous

135
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:02.490
brain teaser.

136
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.440
Sometimes it's just better to know a lot

137
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.370
less in a 1999 paper called the recognition.

138
00:09:11.371 --> 00:09:15.720
Heuristic Goldstein and giga runs are described a psychological experiment

139
00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:19.200
asking which of two cities had a larger population,

140
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.350
San Diego or San Antonio,

141
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:27.540
a group of Germans answered correctly more often than a group of

142
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:28.374
Americans.

143
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:33.030
The Americans likely consider the populations of Texas and

144
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.290
California,

145
00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:38.310
whether they thought the cities were growing and a ton of other factors,

146
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.200
the Germans, well,

147
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:45.420
more of them had heard of San Diego and not San Antonio.

148
00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:50.220
So they figured the famous city was bigger. The end that's it.

149
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.990
The less is more effect actually made them more likely

150
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.243
to be right.

151
00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:01.650
And we've just recently figured out that being dumb can make

152
00:10:01.651 --> 00:10:03.600
you smart, right wrong.

153
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:08.880
We've actually known about this problem for a really long time. In 16,

154
00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:13.500
20 Francis bacon wrote and know him or denim that the human

155
00:10:13.501 --> 00:10:17.250
understanding when it has once adopted an opinion,

156
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.840
neither as being the received opinion or as being agreeable to itself,

157
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:26.610
draws all things else to support and agree with it.

158
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.440
Bacon didn't know the cognitive science behind that phenomenon,

159
00:10:31.441 --> 00:10:35.130
but he had the basic idea, right? For efficiency sake,

160
00:10:35.131 --> 00:10:39.840
your brain tends to process new things by drawing on the

161
00:10:39.841 --> 00:10:44.460
knowledge it currently possesses. It's why I can't make this.

162
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:49.520
<v 2>Big stand up. Come on, work with me here.</v>

163
00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:55.010
Please stand the task here is to balance this egg on

164
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.530
one of its ends. And, uh,

165
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:01.790
it's not really working out for me too well.

166
00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:06.500
<v 0>In Girolamo Benzone is 1565 history of the new world.</v>

167
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:11.120
He wrote that Christopher Columbus challenged a group of noble Spaniards.

168
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:12.283
Gentlemen,

169
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:17.450
I will lay a wager with any of you that you will not make this end stand

170
00:11:17.451 --> 00:11:21.140
up as I will make it. And without anything.

171
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:25.010
<v 2>At all, I don't know why he had to be naked. This kind of weird.</v>

172
00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.410
<v 0>They tried and failed just.</v>

173
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.240
<v 2>Like I've been trying.</v>

174
00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.090
<v 0>Failing. And then Columbus just kind of</v>

175
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.510
smash the egg on the table and.

176
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.400
<v 2>Look at it stood up.</v>

177
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:43.010
<v 0>He wasn't trapped by Einstein along and neither was Alexander.</v>

178
00:11:43.011 --> 00:11:47.480
The great who solved the puzzle of the Gordian knot in the fourth

179
00:11:47.481 --> 00:11:51.950
century, BC, the knot was so complexity,

180
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.120
so intricate, a lot more complex.

181
00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:58.350
<v 2>Get them this. This is a pillow case.</v>

182
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.840
<v 0>That anyone who could untie it would immediately be declared King of</v>

183
00:12:03.841 --> 00:12:07.290
Phrygia. He just cut it.

184
00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.970
<v 2>In half with his sword,</v>

185
00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:13.613
something like that.

186
00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:18.330
<v 0>The way that Indiana Jones was badly outmatched by an expert swordsman.</v>

187
00:12:18.331 --> 00:12:21.300
And then he just shot him with his gun.

188
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:26.340
Everyone has understood this seemingly forever and a recognition

189
00:12:26.341 --> 00:12:31.170
of the Isilon effect is deeply rooted in Asian philosophies in

190
00:12:31.171 --> 00:12:32.100
Zen Buddhism.

191
00:12:32.101 --> 00:12:36.600
The term Shoshan refers to the beginners mind an

192
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:41.370
attitude of openness and eliminating the constraints of experience and

193
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.700
knowledge. Zen end, Dallas meditators,

194
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.650
try to achieve the motion,

195
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.960
the state of a mind without a mind free from attachments

196
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:55.200
and thoughts in Japanese martial arts,

197
00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.900
Zen chin is total awareness,

198
00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:02.220
not just focusing on what you know or think, you know,

199
00:13:02.221 --> 00:13:06.690
but letting every possibility present itself,

200
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.640
even when it's simple,

201
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.390
but this isn't just about illusions,

202
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.420
ancient philosophy or solving cute riddles.

203
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:20.610
Understanding the impact of [inaudible] long can literally save

204
00:13:20.611 --> 00:13:22.740
lives. In the 1970s,

205
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:27.390
a cardiologist named Lee Goldman compiled data on heart attack cases and

206
00:13:27.391 --> 00:13:31.800
found that taking an ECG reading and answering three basic

207
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:36.810
questions could determine whether someone was actually having a heart attack.

208
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:42.000
When this shortcut decision tree was implemented at cook County hospital

209
00:13:42.001 --> 00:13:45.840
in Chicago, the results were incredible.

210
00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.530
It beat the old diagnosis method by 70%.

211
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.010
And the hospital found that highly trained,

212
00:13:53.011 --> 00:13:57.840
experienced doctors diagnosed the most serious cases correctly,

213
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:03.120
75 to 89% of the time while the three step

214
00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:07.650
quick and dirty method was right over 95%

215
00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:08.843
of the time,

216
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.650
depending on a well-educated extremely knowledgeable

217
00:14:13.651 --> 00:14:16.770
professional actually made things.

218
00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:17.963
<v 2>Worse.</v>

219
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.860
People died because we were too smart.

220
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.960
<v 0>We are obsessed with being smart and knowing things.</v>

221
00:14:27.961 --> 00:14:32.910
It's why I'm so curious about science and math and people.

222
00:14:32.911 --> 00:14:36.690
And honestly, it's why this channel exists.

223
00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:41.130
And look, it's important to know stuff and have experience.

224
00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:44.910
And it's important to have a mechanized mind.

225
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:50.190
Luchin said mechanized responses have a place in one's behavior.

226
00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:55.490
They possess the advantages of releasing one from the bother of finding

227
00:14:55.491 --> 00:15:00.020
new responses to recurring every day situations.

228
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.770
They equip one with precise, ready,

229
00:15:03.771 --> 00:15:07.880
and speedy responses to certain aspects of his environment.

230
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:12.320
And they free the mind so that it can more adequately deal with

231
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.500
complicated tasks. Hey dad.

232
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:17.900
But he then went on to say,

233
00:15:17.901 --> 00:15:22.070
when a habit ceases to be a tool discriminately applied,

234
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:26.630
but becomes a Procrustean bed to which the situation

235
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.600
must conform. When in a word,

236
00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:34.430
instead of the individual mastering the habit, the habit masters,

237
00:15:34.431 --> 00:15:35.360
the individual,

238
00:15:35.361 --> 00:15:39.620
then mechanization is indeed a dangerous thing.

239
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.870
Intelligence experience and knowledge are freedom,

240
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:49.850
and they can also be a prison that takes away your

241
00:15:49.851 --> 00:15:51.920
freedom to think differently.

242
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.850
Your brain is the greatest computer ever invented,

243
00:15:56.210 --> 00:16:00.950
but it can also constrain your creativity and limit

244
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:05.150
your potential. We all want to get smarter,

245
00:16:05.151 --> 00:16:09.650
become more creative and solve bigger and more advanced problems and

246
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.750
everything from the video games we play to the society we

247
00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:18.470
live in. There's so much pressure to be smart.

248
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.780
And it's just not always about that.

249
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:27.490
Sometimes you just got to get stupid and as always,

250
00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.513
thanks for

251
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.380
[inaudible]. Hello.

252
00:16:44.381 --> 00:16:48.760

00:16:53.921 --> 00:16:58.150
this is something that Michael Jake and I work on all the time,

256
00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:03.070
and we're not making videos. We are working on this box. This is not merged.

257
00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:08.080
This is a community of people who are interested in living a life of

258
00:17:08.081 --> 00:17:08.914
the mind, Inc.

259
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:14.140
Streaking bird is one of the items that you won't get in this brand new box.

260
00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.500
As you can see this bird very, very, very,

261
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:20.650
very thirsty and has a great hat.

262
00:17:20.651 --> 00:17:25.390
You can see the Vsauce V hat might look a little familiar.

263
00:17:25.391 --> 00:17:30.070
I don't have a top hat. You know, maybe I should get a top hat, but for now,

264
00:17:30.071 --> 00:17:32.830
I'll just stick with this one. Yes.

265
00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:37.630
More water for all. Get your curiosity box at curiosity,

266
00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:42.610

thanks for watching. Oh,

268
00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:53.980
that was gross.
