00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.200
<v 0>The sauce, Kevin here,</v>

2
00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:05.340
and this briefcase contains the entire universe and everything that makes you

3
00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:06.180
mad at a human.

4
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.873
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

5
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.780
<v 0>Yeah, that's it. This is it. Paper, dollar, pencil, sugar cube, playing cards.</v>

6
00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.460
Rubik's cube. Let me explain.

7
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.393
<v 1>Piece of paper.</v>

8
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.420
<v 0>Paper is about 4,000 an inch. And to get the number of layers after folding,</v>

9
00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:35.750
we make two to the power of folds. We start with one.

10
00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:38.570
Then every fold raises that power. One more.

11
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.940
My folding is not going well.

12
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.420
The world record for paper folding is only 12 folds.

13
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.680
If we could fold it 30 times, it'd be thick enough to reach space.

14
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.190
42 gets us to the moon at 103 folds.

15
00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:56.630
The thickness of this paper would be around 93 billion light years.

16
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.250
So basically the diameter of our entire observable universe,

17
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.240
a piece of paper is the size of the universe.

18
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.440
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

19
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.200
<v 0>Inside this sugar cube. In fact,</v>

20
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.210
we all are or could be Adam's are tiny and their fundamental particles are

21
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.220
even smaller. A proton is like a centimeter, one quadrillions of a meter.

22
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.670
The simple way to think of our bodies makeup is that atoms are a collection of

23
00:01:25.671 --> 00:01:29.090
particles with a fair amount of empty space between them.

24
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.520
Quantum physics shows us that's not actually true,

25
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.740
and that a lot is happening and what appears to be

26
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.140
99.999999% empty space. That space matters.

27
00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:42.950
But if we compress the atoms of the human race into a tight ball and ignored

28
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:44.540
what's in between them all,

29
00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:48.800
nearly 8 billion of us would fit inside this sugar cube.

30
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.810
This is us 7.8 billion of us inside

31
00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:57.290
here. We can't hold be unique, right? Right. No wrong.

32
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.280
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

33
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.730
<v 0>108 Billion humans have been born throughout history.</v>

34
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.180
If you're one in a million, like my mom told me, I am.

35
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.590
That means there have been 108,000 humans. Exactly.

36
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.200
Like you, that's not good.

37
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:20.090
How can anybody possibly stand out? I know. Just do something.

38
00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:24.710
No human has ever done before. Like what? Shuffle a deck of cards.

39
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.890
Okay. People have done that, but not the same.

40
00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:30.650
Michael mentioned this in his math magic video, it goes like this.

41
00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:32.840
You've done 52 cards in a deck.

42
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.710
The number of possible combinations is 52 factorial.

43
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.770
So 52 times 51 times. 50 times 49. Yeah. Yeah,

44
00:02:41.771 --> 00:02:44.720
yeah. All the way down to one. Cool. That's.

45
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.480
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

46
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.450
<v 0>That number? Different orders of a shuffled deck.</v>

47
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.970
Every time you shuffle and deal,

48
00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:57.200
you've just created something that's virtually guaranteed to never have been

49
00:02:57.201 --> 00:03:00.610
done before and seriously unlikely to ever be done again.

50
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.530
So ignore your 108,000 clones opportunities to be unique

51
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.060
are actually everywhere. And there's no limit to what you can do because you,

52
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:14.830
my friend, you, you, you watching this video, you're a super computer.

53
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:17.723
<v 1>Uh.</v>

54
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.480
<v 0>Cube has six sides of a three by three grid and each square</v>

55
00:03:24.481 --> 00:03:29.250
is one of six colors. The question is how many permutations exists?

56
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.510
That's a good question. I think of it often he had just this 43 quintillion,

57
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.390
252 trillion, 3 trillion, 274 billion, 489 million, 856,000.

58
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.590
That's it.

59
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.510
And every single possible state of the cube can be solved in 20

60
00:03:45.511 --> 00:03:48.810
moves or fewer. That's called God's number.

61
00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:53.490
And it took Google 36 CPU, years of computing power to determine,

62
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.230
do you Shang soft? The classic three by three by three Rubik's cube in 3.4,

63
00:03:58.231 --> 00:04:00.600
seven seconds. Maybe it takes you longer,

64
00:04:00.601 --> 00:04:04.920
but you're mentally capable of processing any one version of 43

65
00:04:04.921 --> 00:04:09.900
quintillion problems and solving it in a surprisingly low number of steps.

66
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.320
You solve problems in the world. And if you're like me,

67
00:04:13.321 --> 00:04:16.860
you go outside once a month to get more peanut butter. And you notice, Hey,

68
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.630
there's other people around.

69
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:21.773
<v 1>Uh.</v>

70
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.760
<v 0>Helps connect us. But you've got to think about it the right way.</v>

71
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.240
This doesn't actually have intrinsic value money.

72
00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:33.810
Isn't actually worth anything it's paper,

73
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.000
but it does represent a way for everyone to exchange what they've got a thing,

74
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.790
a talent, whatever for what someone else has.

75
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:45.600
The Aztecs used cocoa beans and the ancient Chinese used calorie shells.

76
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.490
I've got a PlayStation. I like making videos and I want a pygmy goat.

77
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.200
It's a lot easier for me to use something that allows me to transfer my old

78
00:04:55.201 --> 00:04:57.150
PlayStation and my video production skills.

79
00:04:57.151 --> 00:05:01.950
And then use that to buy a pygmy goat then to find a

80
00:05:01.951 --> 00:05:05.790
pygmy goat farmer who really needs a PS one and a paradox video.

81
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.350
We have a system that converts what we've got into what we want and give someone

82
00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:13.410
else way to get what they want with what we've got.

83
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.060
And it's not just about money,

84
00:05:15.061 --> 00:05:19.140
currencies like love and trust and loyalty spent nicely too.

85
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.350
You can be you with others.

86
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.350
That's why we're capable of making incredible things.

87
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.193
<v 1>Uh.</v>

88
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.940
<v 0>Such as a number two pencil it's like Leonard reads eye pencil.</v>

89
00:05:32.941 --> 00:05:36.930
It shows the sheer insanity of human cooperation that results in making

90
00:05:36.931 --> 00:05:41.850
something as basic as a pencil, someone farmed the incense, Cedar,

91
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.310
someone built the tractors for that farm.

92
00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:47.520
Someone made the wheels for the tractor, someone minds,

93
00:05:47.521 --> 00:05:51.630
the graphite and clay for the lead. Others binds the metal for the Pharaoh,

94
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.970
no one planned this.

95
00:05:53.971 --> 00:05:58.580
We just all did our little piece and others combine pieces with our needs and

96
00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:01.070
desires to make a thing everyone uses,

97
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:04.760
but no individual person could ever make themselves.

98
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:08.510
We can't even comprehend what's happening in this sugar cube because it's too

99
00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:10.880
complex. What does my universe paper?

100
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.030
We do all of this because we know what zero is.

101
00:06:19.031 --> 00:06:21.040
It's not even just nothing.

102
00:06:21.041 --> 00:06:25.990
It's the absence of value value that exists somewhere. Just not where zero is.

103
00:06:25.991 --> 00:06:29.680
If infinity is so impossibly large, that we can't even really understand it.

104
00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:31.840
Zero is an impossibly deep void.

105
00:06:31.841 --> 00:06:34.840
We process mostly by what it isn't.

106
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:37.570
We do understand the power of something.

107
00:06:37.571 --> 00:06:41.380
That's a placeholder to make an identify greater things,

108
00:06:41.381 --> 00:06:46.090
but that on its own is sort of a terrifying lack

109
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.373
of meaning.

110
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.120
Zero makes the pencils happen and it's the absence of pencils.

111
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.550
It's never getting what we want.

112
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.490
It's never solving a Rubik's cube.

113
00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.270
It's the inability to be unique. It's inaction.

114
00:07:01.271 --> 00:07:03.610
It's an empty sugar cube.

115
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.710
It's being in this unfathomably large paper

116
00:07:08.711 --> 00:07:13.120
universe and fighting against the prospect of being and meaning

117
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.860
nothing. You know what it is, but your everything,

118
00:07:17.861 --> 00:07:20.500
because you're not zero.

119
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.870
The world is big.

120
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:27.670
The universe is complex and you can visualize conceptualize and appreciate some

121
00:07:27.671 --> 00:07:32.410
of the most complicated elements of life by studying

122
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.960
and researching and experimenting.

123
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.580
But also by messing around with some of the junk lying around

124
00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.170
your bedroom or stored in your extremely cool briefcase.

125
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.950
And it's always thanks for watching. Hey, real quick,

126
00:07:47.951 --> 00:07:52.720
this video was actually sponsored by the Ridge wallet. It's tiny, slim strong,

127
00:07:52.721 --> 00:07:56.620
and it won't bulge in your pocket. Are you still sitting on your wallet?

128
00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:00.940
I used to sit on this beast all day. Look at this thing. I can't even close it.

129
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.570
I don't even know what's in here. Receipts. What is this?

130
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.950
I am real Kevin. No, you're not. No,

131
00:08:08.951 --> 00:08:12.520
you're not get out of here. Give me back. My Ridge wallet.

132
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.250
