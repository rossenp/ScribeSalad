00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.360
<v 0>The sauce. Kevin here with two envelopes.</v>

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.050
One of them contains twice as much money as the other one.

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.160
And you get to choose which one you want to take.

4
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.290
But before you open your envelope and find out whether you've won the

5
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:18.540
smaller prize or the larger prize,

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.920
you have the opportunity to switch to the other

7
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.570
envelope. So.

8
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.740
<v 1>Do you, do you switch? The answer is.</v>

9
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.000
<v 0>Now irrefutably 100%. No,</v>

10
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:38.510
in our scenario it makes absolutely no statistical difference,

11
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.700
which envelope you choose.

12
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.110
Each one could contain the lower amount of money or the higher amount of money

13
00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:46.760
with equal probability.

14
00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:51.260
And you have zero information to help you choose one over the other

15
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.280
right.

16
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.080
<v 1>Wrong. The answer is irrefutably.</v>

17
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.480
<v 0>100%. Yes. Switch the envelopes.</v>

18
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.840
And there's a mathematical explanation for why, right?

19
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.940
<v 1>What is happening here?</v>

20
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.090
Let's look, let's,

21
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.700
let's start at the beginning.

22
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.240
<v 0>The origin of the two envelopes paradox is just as confusing as the</v>

23
00:01:20.241 --> 00:01:24.080
problem itself in 1953, Belgian mathematician.

24
00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:28.220
Maurice Krawczyk posed a scenario in his book about recreational mathematics,

25
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.610
in which two men compared the values of neckties,

26
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.810
their wives bought them with neither man. Knowing the prices.

27
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.060
Also in 1953,

28
00:01:38.061 --> 00:01:42.770
a math book credits a similar puzzle using plain cards to physicist,

29
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.760
Erwin, Schrodinger ever hear of Schrodinger's cat,

30
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.160
where a cat in a box is both alive and dead until you open the box

31
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.660
and find out, yeah, same God. And in our problem,

32
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.710
the forces at play on the same, whether we're using playing cards,

33
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.890
neck ties or envelopes, Oh,

34
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.220
also I'm wearing my brand new birthday paradox shirt.

35
00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:09.200
I have a floating the space,

36
00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:13.970
baby bracketed by the chart detailing the probability of at least two people

37
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:17.690
sharing a birthday versus the number of people.

38
00:02:17.691 --> 00:02:22.460
It's in my new Vsauce to store link below where it for all

39
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.390
the space children. So look,

40
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.370
the logic for not switching envelopes is pretty straightforward given that you

41
00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:36.320
don't know anything about either one or even what the higher and lower

42
00:02:36.321 --> 00:02:38.660
values are inside them.

43
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.870
One is just as good as the other,

44
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.100
but the math in favor of switch.

45
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.110
<v 1>Ching is kind of compelling.</v>

46
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:52.130
Let's.

47
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.850
<v 0>Say that the envelope you choose contains X dollars.</v>

48
00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.120
We don't know how much X is just that something in the envelope

49
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.010
we can call X.

50
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.780
The probability of that envelope containing these smaller value is

51
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.460
one half. And the probability of it containing the larger amount is,

52
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.030
is one half is, is 50%.

53
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.080
The other envelope either contains twice that amount,

54
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.390
two X or half that amount, one half X.

55
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.520
If X turns out to be the higher value than the other envelope contains

56
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.840
one half X.

57
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.850
If your envelope X is the lower value than the other envelope

58
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.340
contains two X makes sense.

59
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.690
I've talked about expected value in a few other Vsauce, two videos.

60
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.160
It's the average of the possible outcomes of a series of probabilistic

61
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.210
events,

62
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.040
which we can use to identify the most advantageous course of action.

63
00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:58.720
So to find the expected value of the envelope, we didn't choose.

64
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.910
We add the value of the only two possibilities weighted

65
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.290
by their probability

66
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.010
like this one over two times two X plus one over two

67
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.520
times, one, half X equals five,

68
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.180
over four X, half of the time,

69
00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:22.390
the other envelope will contain two X and half of the time,

70
00:04:22.391 --> 00:04:25.450
the other envelope will contain one half X,

71
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.100
which equals an expected value of five fourths.

72
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.500
X five fourths.

73
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:36.280
X is 25% more than just X.

74
00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:41.110
So our best possible choice is to switch to the other envelope.

75
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.980
Cool. We did it, but that makes no sense.

76
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.100
You have a simple, clean 50,

77
00:04:48.101 --> 00:04:52.180
50 chance of choosing the envelope with more money inside and

78
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.610
switching can't change that.

79
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:58.210
But the math just told us that it can,

80
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.360
don't worry though. It gets weirder.

81
00:05:01.361 --> 00:05:05.500
What if I said you could switch envelopes again, if you wanted to, well,

82
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.940
then you just go through the same process over and over again.

83
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.800
Always switching, never opening forever and ever, and ever,

84
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.250
and ever. And Nervar, and blurber those aren't words,

85
00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:23.170
but you get the point because switching makes the most mathematical sense with

86
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:27.190
switching, gaining you a 25% advantage.

87
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.330
And I just proved it. So

88
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.620
let's come back to math later. It's time for logic logician,

89
00:05:46.621 --> 00:05:50.970
Raymond Smulian posts two scenarios for the paradox. First,

90
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.400
the risk of gaining twice,

91
00:05:53.401 --> 00:05:58.040
the amount in your envelope is worthwhile when the alternative is only

92
00:05:58.041 --> 00:05:59.750
losing half of it,

93
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:05.150
you're gaining X or you're only losing half of X.

94
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.130
The potential payoff is twice as high as your risk of loss

95
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.020
makes perfect sense,

96
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:16.540
but why an envelope contains X and the other contains two

97
00:06:16.541 --> 00:06:17.374
X.

98
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.850
So you're either gaining X or losing X

99
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.370
also make sense, but both can't be true.

100
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.760
So we're gonna do this problem again, using economics, professor Barry,

101
00:06:33.761 --> 00:06:35.440
nail buffs variation.

102
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.990
Let's say that we give an envelope to player one and then flip a coin.

103
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.310
If it's heads,

104
00:06:42.311 --> 00:06:47.020
we put double that amount in the second envelope and give it to player

105
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.570
two. If it's tails,

106
00:06:49.571 --> 00:06:54.100
we put half that amount in the envelope and give it to player to me.

107
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:59.080
If their player knows how much is in their envelope or the outcome

108
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.310
of the coin toss, once they open their envelopes in secret,

109
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.810
they can switch with each other. If they both agree to switch it,

110
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.330
play your opens their envelope and finds 10 bucks with equal

111
00:07:13.331 --> 00:07:14.081
probability.

112
00:07:14.081 --> 00:07:18.700
They think that switching to player two's envelope will get them 20

113
00:07:18.701 --> 00:07:20.920
bucks for a $10 gain,

114
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.540
or take them down to five bucks for a $5 loss

115
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:27.821
player.

116
00:07:27.821 --> 00:07:32.470
One decides to switch because switching gives them a greater possible

117
00:07:32.471 --> 00:07:35.710
reward relative to what they might lose.

118
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.200
Player two who's in another room,

119
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.410
opens their envelope and finds five bucks.

120
00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:46.210
They think there's a 50% chance that switching to player one's envelope will get

121
00:07:46.211 --> 00:07:51.070
them 10 bucks for a $5 game or get them only $2 and

122
00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:54.610
50 cents for a $2 and 50 cent loss.

123
00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:00.220
So player two also thinks that what they stand to gain

124
00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.710
is greater than what they might lose.

125
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.540
They are absolutely sure that their upside is better than their

126
00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:08.380
downside,

127
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:13.180
but it's obvious that both players can't have an

128
00:08:13.181 --> 00:08:14.980
advantage in this game.

129
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:19.900
That's important if you're confused at this point,

130
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.450
good Martin Gardner, one of history's greatest puzzle solvers and care docs.

131
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:30.130
Explainers knew the answer, but admitted that there just,

132
00:08:30.131 --> 00:08:32.740
wasn't a simple way to communicate Kate,

133
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.960
the flaw in mathematical reasoning and sadly

134
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.620
that's where our journey ends. No,

135
00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:45.430
it's not because we can figure this out.

136
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.930
Think of it this way.

137
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:52.660
The total sum of money in the envelopes is three

138
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.470
units,

139
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:58.170
a small unit and a larger value that's made up of two

140
00:08:58.171 --> 00:09:02.580
smalls that combine to form a total of X.

141
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.430
If you've got these smaller envelope,

142
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.610
it's value is X over three.

143
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.280
And if you have the larger envelope,

144
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.790
it's value is two X over three.

145
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:20.760
When you switch from small to large, you gain X over three.

146
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.680
And when you switch from large to small, you lose X over three.

147
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:30.330
So the expected value of switching is one half

148
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.580
times, two X minus X,

149
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.500
over three plus one half times X minus two

150
00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:39.360
X over three,

151
00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.760
which equals

152
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:54.170
zero. There's just no value in switching. It doesn't help us.

153
00:09:54.171 --> 00:09:55.610
And it doesn't hurt us,

154
00:09:55.611 --> 00:10:00.320
which is probably what you knew on till we got math involves

155
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:05.240
the two envelopes problem is a lot more than just X

156
00:10:05.241 --> 00:10:06.770
and two X,

157
00:10:06.771 --> 00:10:10.460
which is what makes it a false cynical paradox,

158
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.940
because there appears to be a gain from switching.

159
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:17.840
When we fail to consider that the States of the two envelopes,

160
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:22.910
don't actually reflect simple values of X and two X,

161
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:27.950
a two X envelope is only two X when it's the larger

162
00:10:27.951 --> 00:10:28.550
amount.

163
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:33.140
And the one half X envelope is only one half X when

164
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:37.370
it's the smaller amount, without recognizing that difference.

165
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.340
Basic algebra playing off our common sense,

166
00:10:40.341 --> 00:10:45.200
fools us into thinking that each switch do gives you a gain of

167
00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:48.590
five over four or 25%.

168
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:52.070
It's really a matter of perspective,

169
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:55.820
depending on which envelope, your holding,

170
00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:59.720
which one you think you have, which one you think you don't have.

171
00:10:59.721 --> 00:11:04.640
And which one you want to wind up with your course of action might

172
00:11:04.641 --> 00:11:08.060
be incredibly clear or not.

173
00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:10.010
And then clear again.

174
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.840
And then not again until you realize that

175
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:18.050
no matter if you diagnose it mathematically,

176
00:11:18.051 --> 00:11:20.780
no matter if you deconstruct it logically,

177
00:11:20.781 --> 00:11:25.640
no matter what you do when it comes to the two envelope

178
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.380
paradox, you were right all along

179
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:33.050
and as always,

180
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.130
thanks for watching

181
00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:46.041
[inaudible] Hey,

182
00:11:46.041 --> 00:11:49.970
I actually started developing this video and began shooting it when

183
00:11:49.971 --> 00:11:54.340
brilliant.org came to me about sponsoring it. I really.

184
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:58.540
<v 1>Like working with brilliant because it's an entire platform based on learning</v>

185
00:11:58.541 --> 00:12:01.210
math and science, by playing with them,

186
00:12:01.211 --> 00:12:03.730
something you may have noticed,

187
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.200
I'm kind of a fan of and surprise, surprise.

188
00:12:08.201 --> 00:12:12.400
They have a really good explanation of these perplexing probability

189
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.450
scenarios.

190
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:18.460
They're interactive puzzles help you expose misconceptions and you are

191
00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:20.530
learning by playing.

195
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:38.220
