00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:00.960
<v 0>The sauce,</v>

2
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.940
Kevin here with a game so complex and so important that

3
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:10.410
it's the basis for an entire five day course on strategic

4
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.423
thinking.

5
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.410
<v 1>This is it, that's it. What is this?</v>

6
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.830
<v 0>Welcome to the El game developed by Edward DeBono over 50 years</v>

7
00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:25.400
ago,

8
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.380
the L game was designed to be the simplest possible game that could stretch the

9
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.590
player's ability to find not just any solution,

10
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.330
but the best solution in a constantly changing environment.

11
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.100
Here's how it works. The Elle game only has a handful of pieces,

12
00:00:43.101 --> 00:00:46.490
a very tiny board and hardly any rules.

13
00:00:46.491 --> 00:00:48.590
And it's deliberately indeterminate,

14
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.880
meaning that two perfect players could theoretically play

15
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.960
forever with no winner. And there's a point to that.

16
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.550
Let's look at the board.

17
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.470
It's just a four by four grid and each player has a single

18
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.970
L shaped piece that takes up four total spaces.

19
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.700
There are also two neutral pieces.

20
00:01:10.701 --> 00:01:14.060
These pennies that can be moved by either player.

21
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.980
And we start the game by nestling the two L's in the center and putting the

22
00:01:18.981 --> 00:01:22.970
neutral pennies in the top left and the bottom right corners.

23
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.470
So get ready to L each player is required to move their

24
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.700
LPs into a new unoccupied spot on the board,

25
00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:32.600
by picking it up.

26
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.130
<v 1>And moving it, flipping it, twisting it, turning it.</v>

27
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.900
<v 0>Whatever. As long as it cleanly occupies four squares.</v>

28
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.340
So like this, or like this, not like this,

29
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.890
or like this it's, you can't do that.

30
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.913
That doesn't work.

31
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.390
As long as at least one square is new and it doesn't

32
00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.890
overlap with the other LPs or a neutral spot.

33
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.310
Then the move is legal. After that move,

34
00:02:04.311 --> 00:02:09.050
the player can choose to move either neutral piece to an open space

35
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.700
or not. It's totally up to you whether you want to play defense,

36
00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:18.500
but you can't move the neutral piece before you move

37
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.270
your L the only object of the game is to make it so that the other player

38
00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:28.190
can't move their LPs. If they can't move, then you win.

39
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.010
Like if our pieces were in this position,

40
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.020
I could move my L here and the neutral piece here.

41
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.230
And I, when your L is locked in,

42
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.560
you can't go anywhere. See,

43
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.000
and that's it it's game over. It seems so easy.

44
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:51.890
So how can this game possibly take five days to master

45
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.470
consider the following board position,

46
00:02:54.471 --> 00:02:58.940
which DeBono uses in his 1967 book five day course in

47
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.760
which is actually three, five day courses. The L game is just one of them.

48
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.170
I'll be player one pink, and you'll be player two orange.

49
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.460
I only have three possible moves here. Uh, let me show you.

50
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.240
It's not that difficult to choose one, right wrong.

51
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.760
Choosing a legal move is easy.

52
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:23.440
Choosing the best move isn't I need to think about what's likely to happen

53
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.850
after I make my move. What will you do on the next turn?

54
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:32.680
And what kind of board position will you put me in for my next move?

55
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.570
Will you play perfectly or will you make a mistake? That gives me an advantage.

56
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.900
And if that's what I have to consider to make the best move,

57
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:43.060
what do you need to think?

58
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.000
It seems impossible to know,

59
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:50.500
and that difficulty is at the heart of DeBono, strategic thinking.

60
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.660
You can employ a few basic strategies to survive and conquer,

61
00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.610
like blocking off a three by three grid in the corner of a board using

62
00:04:00.611 --> 00:04:02.740
your L and a neutral piece,

63
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.940
and then manipulating the other neutral piece to eliminate your opponents

64
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:07.803
possibly.

65
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.640
Or you can think about the grid as two halves and lock your opponent.

66
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.320
In one half of the grid,

67
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.000
Those strategies are pretty good, but they're far from perfect.

68
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.650
Let's go back to my earlier scenario, given my three possible moves.

69
00:04:28.651 --> 00:04:31.860
You have countermoves for each counters,

70
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.640
a and B both result in a loss for me,

71
00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:39.840
because there's just nowhere for me to put my L because remember the neutral

72
00:04:39.841 --> 00:04:43.080
spot can only be moved after a player moves.

73
00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:47.790
The LPs countermoves C is my best possible move because I'm

74
00:04:47.791 --> 00:04:51.540
not locked in. I don't automatically lose with C.

75
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.610
The trick is whether I can see this coming in advance so

76
00:04:56.611 --> 00:05:01.590
that I can avoid taking the L alright, got it.

77
00:05:01.591 --> 00:05:05.520
Three moves. Think ahead. No big deal.

78
00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:08.520
But what if we have this situation?

79
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.010
This has 195 possible moves

80
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.870
with only one of them being the best at one out of

81
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.020
195. Awesome.

82
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.480
Given the confines of the board,

83
00:05:24.481 --> 00:05:28.950
there are 82 possible positions for the L pieces and

84
00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:33.570
2,296 board States all together.

85
00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.460
DeBono teaches that we should learn how to think about the L game

86
00:05:38.461 --> 00:05:42.780
by mentally ranking a move in one of four ways

87
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.310
fatal in which your opponent wins on the next move week,

88
00:05:47.311 --> 00:05:50.730
which leads you into a defensive position, neutral,

89
00:05:50.731 --> 00:05:54.000
which changes nothing for either player and strong,

90
00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:57.740
which gives you the advantage in this position.

91
00:05:57.741 --> 00:06:02.570
There are 65 possible moves. 22 are fatal.

92
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.050
17 are week 26 neutral.

93
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.100
<v 3>And zero strong. Okay?</v>

94
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.720
<v 0>When you consider all those possibilities and keep track of them</v>

95
00:06:13.721 --> 00:06:18.430
two or three moves down the line, perfect play entails,

96
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.380
collecting and evaluating every possible move and making the best choice

97
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.090
based on those results, which is perfectly impossible.

98
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.260
Even for a human mind, obsessed with Tetra.

99
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.200
Domino's like everyone,

100
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.440
modern humans love Ted traumas,

101
00:06:38.441 --> 00:06:43.360
which are geometric shapes made of four equal squares joined edge to

102
00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:47.140
edge. There are five free Tetra Domino's, which are the basic shapes.

103
00:06:47.141 --> 00:06:49.330
You'll probably recognize from Tetris,

104
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:54.160
the L square Z line and T and Tetris

105
00:06:54.161 --> 00:06:57.970
also has to [inaudible] of the L and the Z.

106
00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.780
They can be shifted, rotated, rejiggered,

107
00:07:01.781 --> 00:07:04.420
or reflected to fit all together,

108
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.000
like in this five by eight grid,

109
00:07:07.001 --> 00:07:11.500
which is one of 99,352 ways that

110
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.700
these pieces can fit within these boundaries

111
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.460
or this four by 10 rectangle,

112
00:07:18.461 --> 00:07:23.320
which can be formed any of 57,472 ways

113
00:07:23.321 --> 00:07:27.910
using Tetra Domino's until Minecraft Tetris was the number one

114
00:07:27.911 --> 00:07:30.010
selling game of all time,

115
00:07:30.011 --> 00:07:34.720
because our brains are fascinated with geometry puzzles and considering the

116
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.540
unknowns, a few moves ahead, or 100,000 moves ahead.

117
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.520
Okay, let's go back to Al on day three of training,

118
00:07:45.521 --> 00:07:49.480
DeBono says that a player can note the positions that made them lose,

119
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.000
and the positions that made the other player,

120
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.880
when that mindset is simple,

121
00:07:54.881 --> 00:07:59.290
you'll eventually learn to avoid the bad spots and put yourself in the good

122
00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:03.430
spots experience matters. And it trains us to think,

123
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.650
but it means it takes time and you'll lose a lot of games along the

124
00:08:08.651 --> 00:08:13.630
way you need strategic principles. And if you want to play it yourself,

125
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:17.080
I put a link down below to an online version of the L game.

126
00:08:17.081 --> 00:08:21.490
It'll show you how many possible moves you have in each board state and let you

127
00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:26.290
run simulation after simulation to see just how complex this

128
00:08:26.291 --> 00:08:31.150
simple looking game really is to make sense of the impossibility

129
00:08:31.151 --> 00:08:35.650
of calculating every possible move. In real time to bono advocates,

130
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:40.240
creating a set of several guiding principles that can inform your

131
00:08:40.241 --> 00:08:41.074
strategy,

132
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.610
like always keeping a neutral piece adjacent to your

133
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:50.770
LPs or taking corner positions whenever you

134
00:08:50.771 --> 00:08:54.940
can. There aren't any magic answers.

135
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.600
Possibilities here are endless,

136
00:08:57.601 --> 00:09:02.100
but your strategic principles informed by your experience are

137
00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:04.800
essentially shortcuts to success,

138
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:09.360
allowing you to avoid playing 10 million L games or considering

139
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.670
every single possible move.

140
00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:15.960
The more you play and the better your mental grouping of game situations

141
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:20.520
develops, the more accurate your guiding strategic principles will be

142
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.120
15 years after de Bono's book came out,

143
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.840
M E Goler devised a simple system that will guarantee a player,

144
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.400
at least an indefinite draw and provide opportunities to win.

145
00:09:32.401 --> 00:09:34.440
If their opponent makes a mistake,

146
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.150
if you can get your LP so that it occupies three of the four

147
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:41.370
central squares in the grid,

148
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:46.500
or so it occupies two central squares and no neutral piece occupies

149
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:51.390
any of the squares marked X you're in good shape to not

150
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.860
lose beyond that.

151
00:09:52.861 --> 00:09:57.210
It's up to you to use your strategic thinking skills,

152
00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:01.290
to win the game in an academic mathematical game.

153
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.640
You could spend a few years working out all the moves and ranking their

154
00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:07.860
utility, but in real life,

155
00:10:07.861 --> 00:10:11.040
when you're sitting across the table from the other player,

156
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:16.050
just like your sitting across the table from me, you can't take forever.

157
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.820
You got to make a move.

158
00:10:17.821 --> 00:10:22.530
And the player who can accurately think the furthest in advance is

159
00:10:22.531 --> 00:10:23.850
going to win,

160
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:29.250
which is what we all do every day in our own ways in

161
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.440
our own lives.

162
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:35.880
Today is another day in our never ending course on

163
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.860
strategic thinking.

164
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.220
We don't rotate ELLs on a board,

165
00:10:41.221 --> 00:10:45.750
but we do envision the future and alter our decisions in the

166
00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:50.190
present to give ourselves the best opportunity to succeed.

167
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:54.480
We break down our life boards into smaller,

168
00:10:54.481 --> 00:10:59.220
more manageable sections and create little systems based on what we've

169
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:01.650
learned and what we've come to value.

170
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:07.080
We gain experience and make shortcuts to give us the

171
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:11.970
