00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.440
<v 0>This video is sponsored by no one happy holidays from Vsauce, too.</v>

2
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.560
The sauce, Kevin here, and I've combined one of the Leah's games.

3
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.160
Anyone can play with one of the stupidest,

4
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.990
which is why I we'll need to complete morons to play it.

5
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.800
Thomas Edison and Nicola Tesla. Okay.

6
00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:25.190
They're actually two of the most legendary geniuses of all time,

7
00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:28.370
but their rivalry was serious,

8
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.420
especially over Tesla's alternating current AC electricity,

9
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.700
and Edison's direct current DC,

10
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.910
which we now call the war of the currents,

11
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.260
throwing decades of personal disputes. And they've got a score to settle.

12
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.480
Their balloon avatars will fight to the death with the help of a

13
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.800
toy revolver and a single needle dart.

14
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.180
There'll be playing a form of Russian roulette. Watch my surviving,

15
00:00:56.181 --> 00:01:00.890
the deadliest game video for the math on the original and the stupidest

16
00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:05.720
game humans have played is probably the classic duel where two people

17
00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:10.250
just stand there and shoot at each other on guard

18
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.240
that's that's fencing, but you know what I mean?

19
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.520
These two Titans of the electron are gunna duel with this

20
00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:23.450
one gun Russian roulette style. Okay. The game is simple.

21
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.370
Play your a modes. The cartridge spins the cylinder and shoots it.

22
00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:32.300
Player B. He's so close that it's impossible to miss.

23
00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:36.860
The gun will either fire and he'll win or not.

24
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.930
If it doesn't fire,

25
00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:43.280
he hands the gun to play or B who then spins the cylinder again,

26
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.180
and then shoots. I play her a Ben.

27
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.830
Eventually it goes on until one of them is crowned the emperor of

28
00:01:51.831 --> 00:01:56.750
electricity. First off, don't try this actual game, please,

29
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.790
especially because I'll show you exactly how to try this actual game

30
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.810
without trying this actual game anyway, for now,

31
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.370
what we really want to know is who's more likely to win Edison or

32
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.710
Tesla. Someone's got to go first.

33
00:02:12.711 --> 00:02:17.660
So I'll use an unbiased coin flip to determine the order heads

34
00:02:17.661 --> 00:02:20.960
for Edison tales for Tesla. Here we go.

35
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.310
Heads for Edison, Harrison.

36
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.620
All right, here we go. First shot for Edison to Tesla

37
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.230
who wait to figure out whether there's an advantage to going first.

38
00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:43.100
We can just map out the scenarios in which Edison wins.

39
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.740
We don't even need numbers. Sorry,

40
00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:50.540
numbers let's use E for when the gunfire is for Edison and an X.

41
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.610
When the gun does not fire,

42
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.360
here's a map of all the possible Edison victories.

43
00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.360
This goes on until the gun ease can only fall

44
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:06.190
on the odd rounds because Edison went first and that's really the

45
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:07.024
difference here.

46
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.740
Edison and Tesla have the same chance of winning every round one out of

47
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:12.221
six,

48
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:17.140
but Edison can win on the very first round before Tesla even gets a

49
00:03:17.141 --> 00:03:20.260
turn. That's a major advantage,

50
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.730
but how much and how has this first round

51
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:25.564
advantage?

52
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.680
Because one of the biggest games in the world to literally change its rules,

53
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.590
we'll get to that later for now. It's time.

54
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.870
<v 1>Edison's first shot Erie spin the old revolver.</v>

55
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.853
Here we go.

56
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.250
Tesla survives. Okay. Where are we? Let's think about this.

57
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.960
<v 0>Ability of Edison firing the gun is one over six from the first round,</v>

58
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.380
plus the probability of success in subsequent rounds.

59
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.120
And this goes on and on.

60
00:04:00.121 --> 00:04:04.380
As long as Edison and Tesla keep missing spoiler,

61
00:04:04.381 --> 00:04:08.520
the total probability of the gun firing for Edison comes out to six,

62
00:04:08.521 --> 00:04:12.180
over 11 or 0.5, four or five, four repeating.

63
00:04:12.181 --> 00:04:16.950
So Edison's got a 54.5% chance of winning

64
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.070
this dual, which means Tesla.

65
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:23.820
Tesla is at just 45.5%.

66
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.420
That's a 9% disadvantage for Tesla.

67
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.000
Even in this balloon rivalry,

68
00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:33.690
the deck is stacked in favor of Edison.

69
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.890
You can calculate manually how many trigger poles are in the average game of

70
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.710
idiots, Russian roulette, but Paul J napkins,

71
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.000
Monte Carlo simulations of 10,000 trials confirmed that.

72
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.860
It's about six here's.

73
00:04:46.861 --> 00:04:51.480
What's interesting about two thirds of those games are over in the first six

74
00:04:51.481 --> 00:04:56.370
rounds. There's a long tail with some games going 20 or 30 rounds,

75
00:04:56.371 --> 00:05:01.140
but it's generally a quick game. So Edison getting that first shot.

76
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.810
<v 1>Really matters. Wait, you can.</v>

77
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.220
<v 0>Actually run Russian roulette,</v>

78
00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:09.810
simulations yourself without a computer program or anything more dangerous.

79
00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:13.770
You've got a random number generator in your pocket.

80
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.220
Open the stopwatch, divide a second into six,

81
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.230
0.01 to 0.17 corresponds to the gun firing

82
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.060
0.18 to 0.00 means it doesn't fire.

83
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.480
Start the stopwatch, close your eyes and stop it.

84
00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.670
The decimal value of the seconds is a random firing simulator that you can

85
00:05:35.671 --> 00:05:39.180
use to map out Russian roulette safely.

86
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.850
But now it's time to get back to our game.

87
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.460
<v 1>And it's time for Teslas revanche here we go.</v>

88
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.153
Hold on.

89
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.210
<v 0>If Tesla going second means that he's at such a disadvantage.</v>

90
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.660
How can we make the game more fair?

91
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.480
We can't just play 1000 times alternating who gets to go first?

92
00:06:04.481 --> 00:06:08.830
So that Pantages even out someone's getting popped.

93
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.770
We get one shot at this.

94
00:06:11.771 --> 00:06:16.330
So let's just change the rules to compensate for giving Edison.

95
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.460
The first shot new game.

96
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.730
If Edison's gun doesn't fire in round one,

97
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.260
Tesla gets two shots. If neither of Tesla's shots,

98
00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:31.090
fire Edison gets three shots. This goes on until the gun fires.

99
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.100
Does that actually make the game more fared is giving Tesla an additional shot

100
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.960
after round one enough to make up for his disadvantage

101
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.310
new map. Okay. There's the map of our new version of the game.

102
00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.370
And we can do the same sort of calculation as before,

103
00:06:48.371 --> 00:06:51.880
but the probability of Edison's gun firing is now

104
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.820
that with an exponent corresponding to each of Edison's

105
00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.923
rounds,

106
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.910
the alternating expanding rounds model reduces Edison's chance of winning all

107
00:07:03.911 --> 00:07:07.690
the way down to about 52.4%.

108
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.670
That's two points lower for Edison and two points higher for all Tesla

109
00:07:12.671 --> 00:07:17.590
here. Who's now sitting at 47.6%. It's better.

110
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.560
It's not great, but it's better.

111
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.000
We can keep tweaking the rules. We can keep running the math,

112
00:07:25.001 --> 00:07:29.890
but the most critical part of the deadliest dumbest game might not be

113
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.330
how it's played.

114
00:07:31.331 --> 00:07:36.280
But actually that coin flip that determines who goes

115
00:07:36.281 --> 00:07:38.950
first, which is what the national football league.

116
00:07:38.951 --> 00:07:42.790
One of the most popular sports leagues in the world realized when it changed its

117
00:07:42.791 --> 00:07:45.460
sudden death overtime rules in 2010,

118
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.040
the team who got the ball first won the game.

119
00:07:48.041 --> 00:07:52.390
So often that not winning the coin toss to determine who played on offense.

120
00:07:52.391 --> 00:07:57.250
First meant you lose the game nearly three out of five

121
00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.810
times, but check this out. Look what I found. You're not going to believe this.

122
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.330
And if you do, I won't believe you. All right. Look,

123
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:08.980
when the NFL used sudden death overtime rules coin flip winners won

124
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.400
52% of the time coin flip losers,

125
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.910
one 43.4% of the time.

126
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.770
The other 4.6% were ties. If we evenly distributed,

127
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.020
those ties as wins.

128
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:27.190
That's 54.3% to the coin flip winner and

129
00:08:27.191 --> 00:08:31.360
45.7% for the loser sound

130
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:36.400
familiar. Those are almost the exact same odds of our original Edison,

131
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.340
Tesla, dual game. Look at that. Look at it.

132
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.800
Maybe that's why they called this sudden death settle his dual

133
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.270
once. And for all, here we go. Okay. So using our new game rules,

134
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.740
Tesla actually gets another shot. All right, shot number two for Tesla.

135
00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:54.603
Here we go.

136
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:02.003
<v 1>Innocent.</v>

137
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.440
<v 0>Oh, Anniston survives. Now it,</v>

138
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.300
those back to Edison's turn. That's two misses for Tesla. Here we go.

139
00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.350
Now Edison gets three shots. Say or prayer's Tesla.

140
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:16.940
You're going to need.

141
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:17.773
<v 1>Them.</v>

142
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:23.090
<v 0>Oh, survives once again. Okay.</v>

143
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.250
Two more shots for Edison.

144
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:32.870
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

145
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.990
<v 0>That's another one. All right. One more for Edison.</v>

146
00:09:35.991 --> 00:09:39.410
And then it's going back to Tesla. Here we are.

147
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:46.790
<v 1>Oh.</v>

148
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.710
<v 0>He made it through round two.</v>

149
00:09:48.711 --> 00:09:52.850
Now Tesla gets four tries Edison.

150
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:57.770
You really should have done it that time. Four shots for Tesla shot him.

151
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:01.160
<v 1>Ooh.</v>

152
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.100
<v 0>Ooh, shot. Number one, survived</v>

153
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:10.670
shot. Number two, shot. Number two. This game.

154
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:15.260
Maybe we'll make it to a 30 rounds. Here we go. Spinning shot.

155
00:10:15.261 --> 00:10:17.720
Number three for Tesla.

156
00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:26.390
Number three, the game continues shot. Number four,

157
00:10:26.391 --> 00:10:29.630
chance. Number four. You think one of these four would be in.

158
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.123
<v 1>That's fine.</v>

159
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:39.050
<v 0>I can't believe it. I can't believe it for down. Now.</v>

160
00:10:39.051 --> 00:10:43.430
It goes to five shots for Edison shot.

161
00:10:43.431 --> 00:10:45.680
Number one, Radison.

162
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:53.920
All right. The game continues. The game continues shot. Number two.

163
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:02.570
You think it's one of these? It would be it not so not.

164
00:11:02.571 --> 00:11:06.830
So I'm totally randomizing this folks. No, no funny games here.

165
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.473
Shot number three.

166
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.753
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

167
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:21.200
<v 0>No, I am so sorry. I am sorry.</v>

168
