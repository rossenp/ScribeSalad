00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.780
<v 0>The sauce,</v>

2
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.190
Kevin here and I'm auctioning off the ultra rare PlayStation five

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.390
Jake Roper prepared to cry. Addition to folks,

4
00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:14.070
the frustration and heartbreak of Jake's fruitless attempts at securing

5
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:18.210
his very own PS five. With this addition,

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.130
your buying countless hours of entertainment and a monument to one

7
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:26.220
man's pain. I'm auctioning it.

8
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:28.710
Using a system of sealed bids.

9
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.100
The bidders submit their price and we determine a winner.

10
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.750
I've got four bids ready? Okay. Bid number one

11
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.120
day, co Jima. My great friend today.

12
00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:45.150
OCO Jima who I met for nine seconds in 2013.

13
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.590
Even he can't get a PS five. Alright, well,

14
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.550
$400. That's pretty undervalued.

15
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.970
He must be a very patient and frugal man.

16
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.540
The PS five retails for four 99.

17
00:01:00.541 --> 00:01:05.430
So if this bid wins Kajima is getting a serious

18
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:09.780
deal. Alright, bid number two, balloon. Kevin,

19
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.640
you are not real. Kevin. How many times I am real Kevin,

20
00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:18.840
how did you even get in here? Well, whatever. And what is your pitch?

21
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.350
$3. $3. Okay.

22
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.790
Balloon Kevin is such a scammer. What a stupid bid,

23
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.500
but I guess maybe he thought that low balling was worth a shot. Whatever.

24
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.430
Moving on bid number three. Oh,

25
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.190
this bid is actually from Jake himself.

26
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:41.850
Still desperately trying to get a PS five,

27
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.780
550 bucks. That that's fair.

28
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.050
It's a 10% premium on top of the going price,

29
00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:53.880
which makes sense for something in such high demand, smart bid Jake,

30
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.870
good luck. Hopefully we can dry those Roper tears.

31
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.860
And now to reveal the fourth and final bid drum.

32
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.350
<v 1>Roll please.</v>

33
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.690
<v 0>Thousand dollars. Wow. That is, that is a serious bid.</v>

34
00:02:11.691 --> 00:02:15.440
Michael must really, really want this thing.

35
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.390
That is absolutely what you would call a pro

36
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:22.610
gamer move dramatically.

37
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.910
Outbidding everyone to secure the win.

38
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.710
And here's something that you don't realize is so genius about this.

39
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.610
This is not a normal auction. No,

40
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.770
this is a Vickery auction,

41
00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:41.660
which means the winner doesn't pay the highest bid they paid the

42
00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:44.750
second highest bidders bid. In this case,

43
00:02:44.751 --> 00:02:49.460
that'd be Jake's $550. Sorry, Jake. You're,

44
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.910
uh,

45
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.260
you're really gonna want to stay hydrated because those tears will continue to

46
00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:54.771
flow.

47
00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:59.710
As Michael is playing his brand new P S five after only

48
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:01.150
paying your.

49
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.420
<v 2>$550 Bin. So that's that. And as always,</v>

50
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.150
thanks for watching. Wait, wait,

51
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.293
wait, wait.

52
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.360
<v 0>A really, really aggressive bid worked out this time.</v>

53
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.700
Yeah, but overbidding on a Vickery auction is actually a really,

54
00:03:23.701 --> 00:03:25.620
really bad idea.

55
00:03:25.621 --> 00:03:30.150
And virtually no one realizes that the most popular auction house in

56
00:03:30.151 --> 00:03:34.530
human history works this way.

57
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.230
Here's the question. What are auctions?

58
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.000
The discipline of auction theory within economics is built on a handful of

59
00:03:42.001 --> 00:03:43.770
basic auction formats.

60
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.960
You're probably used to auctions that start low and people bid back

61
00:03:48.961 --> 00:03:52.050
and forth until there's only one bidder left.

62
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.150
The highest bid wins.

63
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.070
That's an English auction or an open bid ascending

64
00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:01.470
auction. If you want to get technical,

65
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.400
you can also do auctions the other way as well.

66
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.650
A Dutch auction starts at a price.

67
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.900
Nobody would pay and descends until the first person bids and

68
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.130
their.

69
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.510
<v 2>Buy wins instantly.</v>

70
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.430
<v 0>And there are two types of sealed bid auctions in a normal sealed bid</v>

71
00:04:20.431 --> 00:04:20.910
auction.

72
00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.860
Everyone submits their secret bid and the highest one wins the end.

73
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.050
Then there's the Vickery auction,

74
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.580
a sealed bid auction in which the highest bidder actually pays the second

75
00:04:32.581 --> 00:04:36.390
highest bid. But why would you do it that way?

76
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.250
Why not just keep it simple and how can such a tiny change in the

77
00:04:41.251 --> 00:04:44.520
rules even make a difference? First,

78
00:04:44.521 --> 00:04:48.600
it's important to note that we're dealing with an item with known value.

79
00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:52.260
There's an established retail price for the PS five.

80
00:04:52.261 --> 00:04:55.890
So we've got a pretty good sense of what it's worth.

81
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.250
Millions of people have paid that price.

82
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.250
Compare that to say a painting.

83
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.320
I might think it's a $100 painting, painting, collector, McGee,

84
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.300
the person I just made up. My think it's a $25,000 painting.

85
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.200
I don't know.

86
00:05:13.201 --> 00:05:18.120
But what about if the item is like an oil field somewhere and no

87
00:05:18.121 --> 00:05:20.550
one knows what's really underground,

88
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.700
that makes it tough to establish a value yourself,

89
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.410
but it makes it really hard to know what other people might be bidding

90
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.360
with a PS five.

91
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.840
We've got a pretty good idea of what other people might be thinking.

92
00:05:33.841 --> 00:05:38.670
So let's say Jake figured he'd be up against someone who might bid

93
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.320
at least as much as the $550 he was willing to pay,

94
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.660
but maybe they'll try to get a deal and hope that everyone else can't

95
00:05:48.661 --> 00:05:49.410
afford it.

96
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.000
He thinks they've got a bidding range of $450 to six

97
00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:59.000
50 with an equal probability of submitting any bid within that range.

98
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.430
So should he bid five 50?

99
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:05.630
So that half the time he wins half the time he doesn't. And when he loses,

100
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:10.520
he's not really out anything in a standard sealed bid auction

101
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:15.040
format. No, if he bends over five 50 and wins,

102
00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:18.790
he's losing value by paying more than he wanted to.

103
00:06:18.791 --> 00:06:23.080
So that's out, but if he bids under five 50,

104
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.610
say five 30,

105
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.660
he'll still win 40% of the time against the mystery bitter.

106
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.710
And each time he wins, he's saving 20 bucks.

107
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.910
If the highest bid was over five 50, he would've lost. Anyway,

108
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.890
the extra value he gains out of saving $20, four times out of 10,

109
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.960
outweighs that one time he'd bid five 30 and lose to a bid

110
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.200
of five 50. That's called bid shading.

111
00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:55.030
And it's what Nobel prize winner William Vickery solved in 1961 in

112
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.540
counter speculation, auctions and competitive sealed tenders.

113
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.980
Victories work on auctions included the development of the revenue equivalence

114
00:07:02.981 --> 00:07:07.300
theorem, which showed that if an auction satisfies a handful of conditions,

115
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.120
the revenue for the seller will be the same,

116
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.870
no matter what the format and for all this,

117
00:07:13.871 --> 00:07:18.610
he found out he won the 1996 Nobel prize in economics just

118
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.920
three days before he died.

119
00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:26.050
So what's so great about Vickery auctions by

120
00:07:26.051 --> 00:07:29.050
making the winner pay the second highest bid,

121
00:07:29.051 --> 00:07:32.830
instead that incentive to manipulate the bidding

122
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.090
evaporated.

123
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.460
And it actually started to pay to be as honest as

124
00:07:39.461 --> 00:07:43.390
possible. Vickery ushered in an era of honest bidding,

125
00:07:43.391 --> 00:07:46.270
being the dominant strategy in an auction,

126
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.400
let's get back to Jake.

127
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:53.590
He wants to pay $550 for the PS five because that's what it's

128
00:07:53.591 --> 00:07:54.790
worth to him.

129
00:07:54.791 --> 00:07:58.600
If he commits to the pro gamer move of bidding eight grand,

130
00:07:58.601 --> 00:08:01.210
just to guarantee that he'll win the auction.

131
00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.500
The second highest bidder could be any number lower than that.

132
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.920
He could get stuck paying 600, 800,

133
00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:11.290
$4,000 or more,

134
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.910
especially if someone else is trying to use the same strategy,

135
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.670
inflating his bid, not only doesn't help,

136
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.730
but could put him in a really bad position.

137
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.740
If Jake wants to try to save a little money, he can still bid $550.

138
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.550
If he wins, he's paying less than that. Anyway,

139
00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:33.370
based on whatever the next highest bid is,

140
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.520
he doesn't have to engage in bid shading.

141
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.160
And if he does try to game the system,

142
00:08:39.161 --> 00:08:43.930
he's susceptible to being outbid and losing in a second

143
00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:44.800
price auction,

144
00:08:44.801 --> 00:08:49.540
potential buyers also have a much harder time colluding with each other to

145
00:08:49.541 --> 00:08:52.000
manipulate the price in their favor.

146
00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:56.520
And sellers just don't have enough information to successfully

147
00:08:56.521 --> 00:09:01.290
plant bids to drive up the price in a Vickery auction.

148
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:05.850
Jake's incentive to go higher or lower than his true value is just

149
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.870
gone. 550 bucks is his best bid,

150
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.180
but it's not just best for him.

151
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:17.580
Everyone he's bidding against has the same incentive to bid. Honestly, too.

152
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.030
The same forces are at work for them and they know it.

153
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:22.950
So why not just be honest?

154
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.260
The seller knows no one's trying to game the system either and they're going to

155
00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:32.790
get the best price for their item. And guess what?

156
00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.520
This is pretty much how eBay works.

157
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.590
Everyone submits their bid and the winner pays just a tiny bit more than the

158
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:45.210
second highest bid Vickery had no way to know that almost

159
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:47.490
60 years after his paper,

160
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.990
one single website on the internet would house nearly a billion and a half

161
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.280
auctions for everyday items worldwide and virtually

162
00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:01.050
everyone would be able to use his bidding system from a device

163
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:02.580
in their pockets.

164
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.930
The 2020 Nobel prize in economics went to Robert B.

165
00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.380
Wilson and Paul Milgrom for their work advancing auction theory.

166
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.420
And we've been thinking about a system where I have something you

167
00:10:15.421 --> 00:10:16.140
want it,

168
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.820
and we need to figure out how to exchange it in a way that's best for both of us

169
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:23.670
for a really long time.

170
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:28.350
The Greek historian Heraclitus wrote about Babylonian auctions in

171
00:10:28.351 --> 00:10:30.360
2,500 BC.

172
00:10:30.361 --> 00:10:34.050
And that's the most surprising thing here in

173
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:38.790
4,500 years of thinking about auctions,

174
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:43.830
the mathematical development optimizing the activity of billions of people

175
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:48.630
is really close to just being honest.

176
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.910
And in the spirit of honesty,

177
00:10:50.911 --> 00:10:55.470
I'm actually not auctioning off my PS five because I have demon souls to play.

178
00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:58.050
And as always, thanks for watching real quick.
