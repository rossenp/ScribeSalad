00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.380
<v 0>The sauce, Kevin here with historical proof that Isaac Newton was wrong.</v>

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.680
At least once in his storied career,

3
00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:11.630
he seems to have been right about gravity and

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.850
calculus and physics,

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.560
8,000 other things that redefined how humans thought about math and science.

6
00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:22.040
But heres what Newton couldn't quite handle

7
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.043
dice.

8
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.090
Some of the are going to think I'm wrong and others we'll agree

9
00:00:32.091 --> 00:00:36.500
that Newton was wrong, but ye will think that it, it doesn't even matter.

10
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.020
This let's start by talking about peeps real quick.

11
00:00:42.021 --> 00:00:46.220

Vsauce tube. Okay.

22
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.690
Samuel peeps gained fame as England's chief secretary to the Admiralty and

23
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.950
eventually became the sixth president of the Royal society of London,

24
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.270
the oldest national scientific institution in the world,

25
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.220
but now he's most famous for his letters and meticulous diaries

26
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.020
in 1693,

27
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.670
peep sent a dice gambling problem to one of the most brilliant mathematical

28
00:01:46.671 --> 00:01:50.180
minds alive, sir, Isaac Newton.

29
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.010
It's the only time Newton's seems to have worked on profitability.

30
00:01:55.011 --> 00:01:58.610
And even though he was mostly right,

31
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.500
he was still wrong.

32
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.720
Here's how peeps made a wager with a man named John Smith over which of the

33
00:02:08.721 --> 00:02:11.840
following scenarios was the most likely to occur,

34
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.000
or if they were all equal a has six dice in a box with

35
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:21.530
which she is to fling a six B has in another box,

36
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.420
12 dice with which he is to flame two sixes C has

37
00:02:26.421 --> 00:02:30.980
an another box 18 dice with which he is to flank three

38
00:02:30.981 --> 00:02:32.360
sixes queue,

39
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.980
whether B and C have not as easy a task as a,

40
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.130
at even luck peeps problem.

41
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.170
Isn't hard to figure out until it is on the surface.

42
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.210
Is it easier to get one six in six dice or

43
00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:53.120
three sixes in 18 dice?

44
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.090
Or is there no difference at all?

45
00:02:56.091 --> 00:03:01.090
In terms of probability peeps posited see with three

46
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:05.620
sixes in 18 dice was the most probable more

47
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:09.850
dice, better odds. Hey,

48
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.760
what are we even doing with ye dice?

49
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.520
We're using standard six sided dice with each side equally likely as an

50
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:21.460
outcome. No funny business here.

51
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.380
The odds of getting a six on each individual role are a simple

52
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.850
one in six. Now we just need to fling them.

53
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.020
Wait, we've got a language problem.

54
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.480
Is the bet here to find out whether we're flinging a six or

55
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.870
does that imply at least one six,

56
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.610
because exactly one six and at least one six are

57
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.500
two different things. And that would apply to B and C two.

58
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.120
It's a critical point in figuring out exactly what our odds are and whether

59
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:01.240
there's any difference as the exchange letters,

60
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.980
Newman interpreted peeps problem as being satisfied with at least the

61
00:04:05.981 --> 00:04:10.720
minimum number of sixes and well peeps predicted that the best

62
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:12.220
shot to win was rolling.

63
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:16.870
At least three sixes and a fling of 18 dice Newton

64
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:18.820
proved it was the opposite.

65
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.840
A is most likely B is the next most likely.

66
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:25.300
And in ye third case,

67
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.350
ye value will be found still less.

68
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.920
And I know that people don't believe this.

69
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.760
There are articles written to this day 300 years later,

70
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.320
claiming that the probability does not change when he ed

71
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.070
dice,

72
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.780
after all every dye has that one in six chance of coming up

73
00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:51.370
six kind of set of six dice is really just six individual

74
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.620
dice, 12 and 18. That's just two and three sets of six,

75
00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:57.970
but they're wrong.

76
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.680
And I'll show you why it's time to prove this by flinging some

77
00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:04.240
dice mathematically,

78
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.190
all the possible probabilities of an event need to add up to

79
00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:11.140
one. So in a coin flip,

80
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.150
there's a 0.5 probability of heads and a 0.5 probability

81
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.110
of tails.

82
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:22.060
And the probability of one of those two outcomes occurring is 0.5 plus

83
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:26.950
0.5 equals one because one of those two things is certain

84
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.370
to happen. And it's the same with our dice game.

85
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.940
So to find the probability of something happening,

86
00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:37.450
it's usually best to calculate the probability of that thing,

87
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.590
not happening, and then subtracting it from one,

88
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.420
those are the only two outcomes here it happens, or it doesn't.

89
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.400
So that calculation everything minus failure leaves us with the

90
00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:53.230
probability of success.

91
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.830
The probability of rolling a six is P hold on. I gotta,

92
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.080
I gotta find my marker probability of finding my marker. 100%.

93
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.620
The probability of rolling a six is P so P equals one over

94
00:06:08.621 --> 00:06:11.530
six. The probability of not rolling.

95
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.530
A six is one minus P.

96
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.490
So the probability of not rolling a six with six dice,

97
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.740
our a scenario is one minus P raised to the sixth power

98
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.270
plug in the one over six value for P and the probability of

99
00:06:28.271 --> 00:06:33.271
rolling@leastonesixwithjustsixdiceequalspointsixsixfiveonedot.dot.

100
00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.760
We do the same thing for B it's not any more sophisticated.

101
00:06:39.761 --> 00:06:43.870
There are just more terms and a little extra steps since rolling.

102
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.820
Only one six in 12 dice is now considered a failure to,

103
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.770
so the probability of B equals one minus P raised to the 12th power

104
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.240
minus 12,

105
00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.130
over one times P times one minus P to the 11th power

106
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.720
that simplifies to one minus one plus 11 P

107
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.530
times one minus P raised the 11th power.

108
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.430
And when we put in our one over six value, again,

109
00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:16.480
the probability of succeeding in scenario beat is

110
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.420
0.6187.

111
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.730
It's about five percentage points,

112
00:07:21.731 --> 00:07:24.880
less than the odds of winning with only six dice.

113
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.840
And that's actually about a 7% swing in outcomes.

114
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:33.010
And like Newton said, C is even worse.

115
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.960
Ye value will be found still less turned out to be 0.5,

116
00:07:37.961 --> 00:07:42.640
nine, seven, three, but Newton didn't actually calculate the third scenario.

117
00:07:42.641 --> 00:07:46.630
He had to calculate all of this math by hand,

118
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:50.290
not using the simple probability notation we just used.

119
00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:55.180
And he actually made a really detailed series of tables that people

120
00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:58.060
could use to do the calculations himself.

121
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.580
Newton's tables used first principles,

122
00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:04.240
basic knowledge rather than complicated specialized knowledge.

123
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:09.310
So peeps could confirm the calculations like this and plug in his own

124
00:08:09.311 --> 00:08:11.290
values. So for example,

125
00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:15.760
the probability of at least one six and a toss of six dice is

126
00:08:15.761 --> 00:08:20.620
obtained from column F by dividing row nine outcomes with at least

127
00:08:20.621 --> 00:08:25.240
one six by row two, total outcomes for the dice throne.

128
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.870
It's simple, elegant genius. I,

129
00:08:28.871 --> 00:08:33.670
and he can do it a lot more simply and crunch the numbers on a calculator or

130
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:38.560
run a simulation of say 100,000 trials of 18 dice

131
00:08:38.561 --> 00:08:42.130
rolls and just a few seconds to confirm the results.

132
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.240
But if ye wants tables like peeps got

133
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.130
tables, Isaac Newton didn't have those computational tools.

134
00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:55.830
And to be honest, he wasn't that familiar with probability.

135
00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:58.830
No one in the 17th century was,

136
00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.430
that's why he got the numbers, right?

137
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:06.620
And he got the reasoning wrong. In 2006,

138
00:09:06.621 --> 00:09:10.760
Steven Stigler, a professor of statistics at the university of Chicago,

139
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.510
detailed a serious flaw in Newton's logic.

140
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.790
As the correspondence evolved,

141
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.920
Newton's assigned scenario a to a fictional man named Peter and scenario

142
00:09:21.921 --> 00:09:23.660
B two James.

143
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:28.340
He explained that Peter only needed one six in his fling of

144
00:09:28.341 --> 00:09:33.050
six dice while James needed a six in each flaying of six dice.

145
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:38.240
So it was easier for Peter to win same with the unnamed

146
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:43.430
player. See who's flinging 18 dice Newton completely

147
00:09:43.431 --> 00:09:48.020
ignored the possibility of getting more than one six in each

148
00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:48.854
fling.

149
00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:53.840
And that's just a different problem than the one we're dealing

150
00:09:53.841 --> 00:09:58.400
with here. If that seems like a minor detail,

151
00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:02.720
it really isn't. Yeah, his explanation was wrong,

152
00:10:02.721 --> 00:10:04.130
but his answer was right.

153
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.790
And that seems to be enough for most people,

154
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:12.410
almost no one talks about how his conclusion was

155
00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:17.360
wrong. And that's, what's amazing about this problem to me.

156
00:10:17.361 --> 00:10:21.860
Does it matter if he are wrong about why

157
00:10:21.861 --> 00:10:25.250
you are right on number 23rd,

158
00:10:25.251 --> 00:10:29.960
1693 in his third letter on peeps dice problem Newton's

159
00:10:29.961 --> 00:10:33.800
explanation conflated that original language problem.

160
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:38.810
I pointed out whether we are hoping to get exactly a number of sixes or

161
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:43.940
at least a certain number. He was confused.

162
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:48.740
He knew the math and he nailed it despite probabilistic thinking,

163
00:10:48.741 --> 00:10:52.520
not even really being a thing in his era,

164
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:57.170
but his reasoning couldn't quite catch up to the numbers.

165
00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.250
That's okay. And for centuries,

166
00:11:01.251 --> 00:11:03.350
we kind of let that go.

167
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:08.390
Part of it was that it took a long time to develop enough knowledge to know

168
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.950
why Newton's explanation wasn't exactly right.

169
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.810
Probability seems to have evolved from wanting a better understanding

170
00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.800
of gambling and the numbers were accurate.

171
00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.210
And part of it was that he's Isaac Newton,

172
00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:31.190
no one's making a career. We are disputing the details of a man on humanities,

173
00:11:31.191 --> 00:11:36.020
Mount Rushmore of math and science, except Stigler.

174
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.950
And I, I guess me,

175
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:44.810
but Newton peeps problems shows us how numbers can't just

176
00:11:44.811 --> 00:11:46.730
exist on their own.

177
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.350
They work hand in hand without understanding of the problems

178
00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:52.700
they're applied to.

179
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.640
And really Newton's solution has evidence that ARCOMs razor is right.

180
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.750
That the simplest method is probably the right one.

181
00:12:01.751 --> 00:12:06.370
And the simpler sequence of events is probably going to work

182
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.660
more often.

183
00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:11.740
We use that mindset to develop and improve everything from

184
00:12:11.741 --> 00:12:16.240
manufacturing and assembly lines to coding software for

185
00:12:16.241 --> 00:12:20.650
sustainability. We need it to progress.

186
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:26.200
The important thing is someone needs to get complicated

187
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:27.910
about getting simple,

188
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:32.140
to prevent seemingly simple things from getting suddenly

189
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:33.693
complicated,

190
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:39.070
which makes things simpler for us so that

191
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.360
we can move on to things that are more complicated.

192
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:48.220
And as always, thanks for watching.

193
00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:12.210
