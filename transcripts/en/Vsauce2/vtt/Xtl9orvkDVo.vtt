00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.610
<v 0>Sauce Kevin's here playing one of the deadliest games</v>

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.680
ever created. So deadly,

3
00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:12.330
in fact that I needed balloon Kevin to act as a proxy for

4
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:16.560
me, real Kevin I'm real Kevin,

5
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.150
the game is Russian roulette.

6
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.280
You probably already know how Russian roulette is played. Traditionally,

7
00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:30.330
a single round is put in a revolver that holds six cartridges.

8
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.890
The cylinder is spun,

9
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:35.130
so that it's impossible to know which chamber will be fired.

10
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.290
You pull the trigger and there's a five out of six chance

11
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:45.240
that you are safe and a one out of six chance that it goes really

12
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:46.680
badly for you.

13
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.520
I've inserted a single needle into each dart.

14
00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:52.830
So that in our version of this game,

15
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.270
it's going to go very badly for poor balloon Kevin,

16
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.530
and that's dangerous and unsafe.

17
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.420
This whole thing is dangerous and unsafe and against the terms of service for

18
00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:08.880
every site on the internet. Thankfully,

19
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.410
Russian roulette is mostly used in movies as a dramatic device,

20
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.490
and I'm using it as a dramatic way to analyze probability.

21
00:01:17.491 --> 00:01:22.440
The important part is that you never do any of this

22
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.560
ever. Okay. Okay.

23
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.020
I want to figure out the best way to survive this notoriously

24
00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:33.510
fatal game. So if balloon,

25
00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:36.090
Kevin plays a standard game of Russian roulette,

26
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.920
he has one in six odds of permanently deflating his dome.

27
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.810
There's about an 83% chance that my rubbery little clone wins

28
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.700
and a 17% chance he loses forever.

29
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.190
And that's that. So here we go. It's time to test your luck balloon.

30
00:01:56.191 --> 00:01:57.024
Kevin.

31
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.183
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

32
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.000
<v 0>Let's make this scenario a little more complex.</v>

33
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.560
Let's say that there are two balloon bursting missiles inside

34
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.900
six chambers with two possible spherical air sex splattering

35
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:19.640
darts that have been placed next to each other. Adjacent.

36
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.620
There's a two out of three chance that my air headed doppelganger survives on a

37
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:29.210
random poll of the toy. So do you like your chances?

38
00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:33.830
Boy, you think that Sharpie mustache is better than the real deal?

39
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.030
Well, let's see a fate is on your side.

40
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.570
The two out of three survival chance comes through.

41
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.850
So it's onto the next round.

42
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.040
My gaseous twin has had a bit too easy of a chance up until

43
00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:59.270
now. The survival math has been very, very straightforward,

44
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.510
had no active role in deciding his own fate.

45
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.430
So let's give him something to think about for round two.

46
00:03:08.431 --> 00:03:12.480
I'm going to give him a choice and place the life odds and his

47
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.070
pipe cleaner hands. The choice is this.

48
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.970
Now he's managed to survive one round of the game.

49
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.140
Does he want to spin the cylinder before playing again?

50
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.160
Or does he just play and hope for the best?

51
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.080
The big question is,

52
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.970
is it better for him to randomize the cylinder or continue

53
00:03:35.971 --> 00:03:39.930
playing with its current configuration? Well,

54
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.060
answer the question, punk,

55
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.980
what's it going to be a blue to be wearing balloon buffoon,

56
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.670
given that there are two adjacent cartridges in there and the toy has been

57
00:03:53.671 --> 00:03:55.260
fired once already.

58
00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.300
Does it even matter mathematically whether air Kevin spins or

59
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.190
not, let's find out the first option spinning.

60
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.160
It's the same scenario with the same math.

61
00:04:08.161 --> 00:04:10.950
You're basically recreating round ones, odds,

62
00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:14.820
which we know give you a two out of three chance of survival.

63
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.860
So not really a whole lot to consider there,

64
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.050
but if you don't spend, you know, something else,

65
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.580
the toy he has just been fired on one of the empty chambers,

66
00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.620
which is how balloon Kevin survived to get to round two and a

67
00:04:34.621 --> 00:04:39.090
little logic reveals the math of whether to spin or not spin.

68
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.010
Think about the positioning.

69
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.080
There are four possible empty chambers and only one of them

70
00:04:46.081 --> 00:04:49.200
is directly before the two cartridges,

71
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.870
which means there's a 75% chance that round two's trigger pull

72
00:04:54.871 --> 00:04:57.900
is on another empty chamber.

73
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.150
And just a 25% chance that this balloon is about to go by

74
00:05:03.151 --> 00:05:05.880
boom, by not spinning balloon.

75
00:05:05.881 --> 00:05:09.930
Kevin has earned himself about eight more percentage points of

76
00:05:09.931 --> 00:05:11.160
survivability.

77
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.030
And it's such a straightforward probability calculation because we know

78
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.250
that the darts are adjacent.

79
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.530
If they were just randomly placed in the chamber, then

80
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.920
things change.

81
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.660
Here's how there are 15 possible positions for two

82
00:05:33.661 --> 00:05:36.840
darts. Randomly arranged in six chambers.

83
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.520
Six of them are adjacent. So darts would be in one and two,

84
00:05:41.521 --> 00:05:44.520
two and three, three and four, four and five, five and six,

85
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.110
all the way to six and one,

86
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.610
there are six more ways that there can be a single space between the darts.

87
00:05:50.611 --> 00:05:54.870
So one and three, two and six, one in five, four and six,

88
00:05:54.871 --> 00:05:57.920
three and five, two and four. Finally,

89
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.050
there are just three ways that darts can be opposite. One another one in four,

90
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:06.110
three and six and two and five.

91
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.550
If balloon even survives the first round.

92
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.080
And he doesn't know whether the darts are next to each other or spread out,

93
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.210
does he want his second shot with a spin or with no

94
00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:25.130
spin? We know that we have a 75% chance on surviving those six

95
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.840
adjacent positions for the cylinders that have darts one space apart,

96
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:35.000
two of the four empty positions come before an empty and two of the four come

97
00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:38.300
before a dart. So that's 50%

98
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.890
and it's the same for the opposite darts.

99
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.680
Our overall safety probability here is a calculation of those

100
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.270
weighted probabilities.

101
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.680
And it goes a little something like this six over 15 times three,

102
00:06:57.681 --> 00:07:01.430
over four plus six, over 15 times two, over four plus three,

103
00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:03.860
over 15 times two over four,

104
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.780
three over 10 plus one over five plus one over 10 equals three over five.

105
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:13.940
I not spinning here. We have a 60% chance of survival.

106
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.060
<v 1>They're two 66.6, 7% to over three.</v>

107
00:07:19.061 --> 00:07:21.610
When we do spin.

108
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.050
<v 0>When we know the darts are adjacent,</v>

109
00:07:26.051 --> 00:07:28.900
we can gain 8% survivability.

110
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.150
When we know they're random,

111
00:07:31.151 --> 00:07:35.020
we can avoid losing about 7%.

112
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.300
It's not some magic solution that allows balloon Kevin to survive.

113
00:07:40.301 --> 00:07:44.980
What's probably humanity's most deadly game doing the

114
00:07:44.981 --> 00:07:48.850
math. Doesn't unveil a secret way to win 80%.

115
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.570
<v 1>Of the time. It just doesn't work that way.</v>

116
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:56.080
It could get ya 8% and

117
00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.850
8% pretty insignificant. Isn't it?

118
00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:01.331
<v 0>No,</v>

119
00:08:01.331 --> 00:08:06.070
it's not consider this 0.1% of

120
00:08:06.071 --> 00:08:10.720
DNA is responsible for all the differences you see amongst humans.

121
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:15.160
And only 1.3% separate us from chimps.

122
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:19.780
1984 was the last us presidential election.

123
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.110
With more than an 8% popular vote gap.

124
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:27.280
Improving road safety by 8% would save

125
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.940
96,000 lives per year.

126
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:36.160
A $1,000 investment growing at 8% compounded annually

127
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.680
doubles in just nine years.

128
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.600
And ultimately if you're an incredibly attractive balloon with

129
00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:48.460
nice big googly eyes, a perfectly formed cotton ball,

130
00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:49.031
nose,

131
00:08:49.031 --> 00:08:53.830
and surprisingly muscular pipe cleaner arms that finds itself

132
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.370
locked in a life or game of chance.

133
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:01.680
You'll take any advantage you can get to avoid being popped and as

134
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:05.790
