00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.210
<v 0>The sauce, Kevin here with a game that starts out easy,</v>

2
00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:05.820
but quickly becomes impossible.

3
00:00:05.821 --> 00:00:10.770
You can beat the best in the world at it and still not get very

4
00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:11.604
far here.

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.590
I'll show you the goal is to get one of these checkers to the other side

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.210
of this line.

7
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.590
Ha I win. I just won an impossible game, right?

8
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.790
Wrong kinda. I won the, uh,

9
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.340
when the baby level, but it gets a lot more complex than this real quick.

10
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:37.260
This video is sponsored by mischief.

11
00:00:37.261 --> 00:00:41.910
The internet explorers behind viral drops like the man eating food channel.

12
00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:45.150
He started by eating noodles and then he ate Pewdie pie.

13
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.500
And to the times newer Roman font, it looks exactly like times new Roman,

14
00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:50.820
but it's 8% wider.

15
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:55.800
So it makes writing papers 8% quicker or the mischief box that sold out in under

16
00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:59.190
five seconds. It was like a Vsauce to video in real life.

17
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.120
The box had between zero and $7,000 of items inside.

18
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:07.920
It costs $100. If you didn't open it, they buy it back for $1,000.

19
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.360
After 100 days,

20
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.350
basically a massive experiment in expected value and psychology.

21
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.430
These are just three of over 20 drops. Every two weeks,

22
00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:22.380
never restocked or repeated like an AI bot that texts you pictures of feet or a

23
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.130
collar that swears when your dog barks, most of it's free,

24
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.820
weird digital experiments. And a lot of it gets taken down pretty quickly.

25
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.210
So to get early access to drops as well as secret drops,

26
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:37.920
download the free mischief app, M S C H F no vowels. Okay.

27
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.023
Back to our game,

28
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.250
your goal is to get these checkers as far over the line as possible.

29
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:49.080
There are hardly any rules you can use as many checkers as you want.

30
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.830
And actually I got some empty spaces here.

31
00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:57.480
This checker set only came with 30 and that won't be enough for my needs.

32
00:01:57.481 --> 00:01:59.880
So I'm, uh, I'm not gonna use these.

33
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.420
I'm going to use poker chips. There's no limit to how many you can use.

34
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:09.030
You just have to place them under the line.

35
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.430
Chips can only jump other chips.

36
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.970
It can't just slide forward to an unoccupied space.

37
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.560
You can't just do that. They also can't jump diagonally,

38
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.580
but they can jump both vertically and horizontally.

39
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.520
So at least we got some of that sweet sideways action.

40
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.670
And when a chip does get jumped,

41
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:32.700
it gets removed from the board like that.

42
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.630
That's it welcome to Conway's soldiers. Oh,

43
00:02:36.631 --> 00:02:40.050
and this is a one player solitaire game.

44
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.220
Solitaire is any one player game, not just the card game.

45
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:48.660
So get ready to social distance, your little heart out.

46
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.260
And the beginning of the video, I use two checkers to get to level one.

47
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.580
It's almost just as easy to get to level two using four checkers.

48
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.150
It only takes three quick moves and we've ascended to new Heights.

49
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.200
Well done yet. Still not all that impressive.

50
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.330
Two level three is where it starts getting interesting.

51
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.910
In 1961, mathematician,

52
00:03:11.911 --> 00:03:15.360
John Conway invented this simple chip game.

53
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.960
It wasn't as trivial as it appears.

54
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.290
We can think of the chips as soldiers,

55
00:03:22.291 --> 00:03:26.790
trying to figure out how to penetrate as deep as possible into enemy

56
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.230
territory, getting to levels one and level two.

57
00:03:31.231 --> 00:03:34.950
Wouldn't take a whole lot of soldiers or sophistication,

58
00:03:34.951 --> 00:03:38.100
but the deeper those soldiers try to go.

59
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.320
The harder it'll be to arrange, actually it doesn't just become hard.

60
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.210
It becomes mathematically impossible, which seems impossible.

61
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.910
If we have infinite soldiers,

62
00:03:50.911 --> 00:03:55.350
why can't we make it to infinite levels? Firstly,

63
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.820
let's figure out how to maneuver one soldier from our tiny chip battalion

64
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.810
into level three, you'll need at least eight soldiers,

65
00:04:03.811 --> 00:04:08.220
but you can do it in just seven moves in this configuration.

66
00:04:08.221 --> 00:04:10.710
You essentially have two separate forces.

67
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.360
The left wing repeats what we did in the last game to get a soldier to

68
00:04:15.361 --> 00:04:20.070
level two and the right wing sets up two volts to get our

69
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.930
little Rambo to level three. You've got to think about it a little bit,

70
00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:29.670
but uh, you're going to get it for levels. One, two, and three.

71
00:04:29.671 --> 00:04:33.990
It took two, four. And uh, hang on. I gotta make some room here. Hold on.

72
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.360
I'm going to try to move this without ruining everything for levels.

73
00:04:39.361 --> 00:04:41.850
One, two, and three, it took two,

74
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.770
four and eight soldiers and we've got ourselves a nice two to the

75
00:04:46.771 --> 00:04:49.230
nth power pattern here.

76
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.180
Achieving level four should be two to the fourth power

77
00:04:54.181 --> 00:04:56.640
for 16 soldiers.

78
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.680
There also seems to be a pattern on the number of moves it'll take as well.

79
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.150
If we call the initial number of moves to get to level one.

80
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.920
And then the level two seems to be two N plus one,

81
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.020
two times one plus one equals three moves. Then we'll make an,

82
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.490
that number of moves and put it into our two N plus one

83
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.690
algorithm for two times three plus one equals seven moves.

84
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.920
All of this works perfectly.

85
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.550
Our two to the fourth power equals 16 soldiers.

86
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.230
We'll take two times seven plus one equals 15 moves to reach

87
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.060
level four. Finally,

88
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.860
we've got a clean easy system to get to level

89
00:05:43.861 --> 00:05:48.060
four and beyond right wrong.

90
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.100
This is where the simulation breaks. We actually need.

91
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.593
Get this.

92
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.910
We actually need 20 soldiers to make it level four book,

93
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.970
slide this back on in the hair. I don't know why I

94
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.873
can't take it back.

95
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.380
We create this same starting pattern as we use to get to level three,

96
00:06:11.381 --> 00:06:13.630
but it'll end up one level higher.

97
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.190
Then we play it out just as before and launch our soldier to save private Ryan

98
00:06:18.191 --> 00:06:21.130
in level four of enemy territory.

99
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.610
And it takes 19 moves. Not the 15.

100
00:06:24.611 --> 00:06:28.720
We expected everything I assumed was wrong.

101
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.800
Our easy rule on soldiers stopped working yet.

102
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.480
We still found a way we didn't have a formula for how many

103
00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:38.710
moves we needed,

104
00:06:38.711 --> 00:06:43.120
but we got there anyway with the little ingenuity from our five star general

105
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.640
MI, we conquered level four. I'm ambitious though.

106
00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:51.580
Like Gangas Kahn and Alexander the great before me.

107
00:06:51.581 --> 00:06:56.380
So what will it take to extend our Vsauce to empire into

108
00:06:56.381 --> 00:07:00.760
level five, five?

109
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.670
This board ends at four.

110
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.870
I guess I got to make my own board sign-on checkerboard.

111
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:23.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

112
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.650
<v 0>Yay. All right. I did it. Here's my custom board.</v>

113
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.100
And the first move that you need to make to get to level five,

114
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.090
nothing, nothing works for level five.

115
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.560
It's like trying to invade Russia in winter. Seriously.

116
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:44.560
It's impossible. Impossible.

117
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:49.390
I'll even link you to a website where you can try for yourself.

118
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:54.040
It's so weird having a limit of four rows seems to make

119
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.960
no sense, right? First learned about this. I thought this makes no sense.

120
00:07:58.961 --> 00:08:03.910
We have an infinite number of soldiers and a board of theoretically

121
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.310
infinite size.

122
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:10.300
It only took 20 chips to get to level four and level five.

123
00:08:10.301 --> 00:08:11.860
Isn't that far,

124
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:17.170
how can we not ever even get to level five?

125
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.940
The answer is beauty and

126
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.670
taxis. If we,

127
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.030
our target on level five with a T,

128
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:33.160
we can Mark all the moves around it with an exponent that shows how many steps

129
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:34.960
away that position is.

130
00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.860
It's the sum of the horizontal and vertical steps to get there.

131
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:44.170
It's the Manhattan number, which stems from taxi cab geometry,

132
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.060
just like a taxi in New York city has to drive across a grid.

133
00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:50.770
So do we,

134
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.030
and as we map out the moves away from our target,

135
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.880
think about the three types of possible jumps ones that get us closer to the

136
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:04.080
goal ones that get us further and ones that are neutral.

137
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.700
Conway use this weighting of each cell to have

138
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.860
to calculate, uh,

139
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:21.440
I need number file the maximum proof of why Conway soldiers can

140
00:09:21.441 --> 00:09:25.400
never make it to level five is explained perfectly by Berkeley.

141
00:09:25.401 --> 00:09:27.410
Math professor says to stack of, uh,

142
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.880
over at number file two and it's 42 minutes long.

143
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.700
It's surprisingly easy to follow. And along the way,

144
00:09:34.701 --> 00:09:37.790
you'll see how Conway's game depends on the,

145
00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.470
um, no, it depends on,

146
00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.700
I gotta destroy my beautiful board. Oh wow.

147
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.560
Depends on the golden ratio.

148
00:09:51.561 --> 00:09:56.420
The proportions we see in the natural world from flowers to the

149
00:09:56.421 --> 00:10:01.370
composition of pretty faces and it pops out of nowhere in the middle

150
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:02.503
of the game,

151
00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:07.040
but it turns out we can reach the impossible level

152
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.960
five and taste them.

153
00:10:08.961 --> 00:10:13.160
And Gareth Taylor proved that we can get to the fifth row with the board of

154
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:17.570
infinite space, infinite soldiers and infinite moves provided.

155
00:10:17.571 --> 00:10:20.960
We bend the rules a little bit.

156
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:25.010
All you got to do is manipulate time.

157
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:30.140
You really can go as far down this mathematical rabbit hole as you

158
00:10:30.141 --> 00:10:34.820
want. But what started as a simple solo lattice game,

159
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:39.620
morphed into a metaphor for both expertise and hope

160
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:42.260
with nearly everything we do,

161
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:46.550
the first few levels are actually pretty easy,

162
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.210
but as we aspire to the more elite tiers,

163
00:10:50.211 --> 00:10:52.220
it takes more soldiers.

164
00:10:52.221 --> 00:10:56.930
It takes more moves and a more sophisticated configuration to

165
00:10:56.931 --> 00:11:01.550
reach the top. It takes hard work and understanding.

166
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:06.110
And just when we think we can't go any further ingenuity and

167
00:11:06.111 --> 00:11:10.580
creativity takes us to a place we thought was impossible

168
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.250
on April 12th, 2020,

169
00:11:13.251 --> 00:11:17.990
we lost one of the greatest mathematical minds of the 20th and 21st

170
00:11:17.991 --> 00:11:22.130
centuries to the COVID 19 virus. John Horton,

171
00:11:22.131 --> 00:11:24.260
Conway was 82 years old.

172
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.580
He talked once about an object that existed,

173
00:11:28.581 --> 00:11:31.790
not just in three or four dimensions,

174
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:36.230
but in 27 digit number dimensional space,

175
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.880
he called it the monster. He said,

176
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:44.030
these things are so beautiful.

177
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:49.700
It's such a pity that people can't see them. Well,

178
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.880
maybe we can't. I can't,

179
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:58.270
but John Conway helped us see the beauty of math in

180
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.410
everything, even something as simple

181
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.390
as a check and as always,

182
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.393
thanks for watching.

183
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:31.990
[inaudible].
