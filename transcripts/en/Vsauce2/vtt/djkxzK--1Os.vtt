00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.350
<v 0>The sauce, Kevin here,</v>

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.520
and you are lying to yourself basically all day long.

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.480
You don't even know it.

4
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.550
And sometimes other people are conspiring to steer your mind where it

5
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:15.390
shouldn't go. You get patterns wrong, you get numbers wrong,

6
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.860
you get prices and values wrong. And it's totally not your fault.

7
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.930
Right wrong.

8
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.190
It's why 40,320 is actually greater than

9
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.190
40,320.

10
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.500
<v 1>Huh?</v>

11
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.270
<v 0>Okay. I've got two very simple math problems here under these papers.</v>

12
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.290
Eight and beat choose the one you want to solve.

13
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.400
Choose right now. Do you want to solve eight or do you want to solve B?

14
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.920
Go ahead. Okay. Now that you've chosen.

15
00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:51.770
When I flipped the papers over to expose the problems,

16
00:00:51.771 --> 00:00:55.520
you'll have exactly five seconds to solve the one you chose.

17
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.350
And if you don't have enough time to solve it,

18
00:00:57.351 --> 00:00:59.570
you could just estimate the answer ready?

19
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.660
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

20
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.190
<v 0>Time's up. All right. Let's be honest.</v>

21
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.150
Virtually no one was able to multiply those numbers fast enough,

22
00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:16.010
at least not accurately. But what about your estimates? We know that one times,

23
00:01:16.011 --> 00:01:17.840
two times, three times, four times, five times, six times,

24
00:01:17.841 --> 00:01:20.330
seven times eight and eight times, seven times, six times, five times,

25
00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:21.230
four times, three times,

26
00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:25.550
two times one are the exact same problem because of the community of property,

27
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.210
which is like a times B equals B times a.

28
00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:33.800
It doesn't matter what order we multiply the terms start small,

29
00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:37.910
get bigger, start big, get smaller. It makes no difference,

30
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.590
same result, but in a 1974 article called judgment under uncertainty,

31
00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:45.200
heuristics and biases, Amos, Tversky,

32
00:01:45.201 --> 00:01:48.860
and Daniel Conaman revealed that the group who tried to solve problem,

33
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.270
a multiplying with the small numbers first had a median estimate of

34
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.280
512 group B who started by multiplying larger

35
00:01:58.281 --> 00:01:59.600
descending numbers.

36
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.580
Their median estimate was 2,250 over four

37
00:02:04.581 --> 00:02:09.500
times higher than a, just because the order of the numbers was different.

38
00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:12.890
That seems weird. No, that's normal.

39
00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:15.590
We do this all the time and just don't know it. Oh,

40
00:02:15.591 --> 00:02:18.920
and the actual answer to this problem is as you may have guessed

41
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.650
40,320,

42
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:26.090
so both groups were way off each other and way,

43
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.580
way off the truth.

44
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.010
The fact is whether you started with big numbers or small numbers,

45
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:38.330
you were anchored into a mode of thought that depended on your initial

46
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.000
information. Anchoring is a cognitive bias.

47
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:44.630
That basically sets the tone for how you think about something.

48
00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:49.610
And it can be really tough to break out of it or consider other

49
00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:53.780
relevant factors like video game prices.

50
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.790
I recently got into a teeny tiny Twitter argument about how $70

51
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.790
games now are actually cheaper than the prices of video games. 20 years ago,

52
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.770
paying 60 bucks in the year 2000 was actually $90 and

53
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:11.740
69 cents in real dollars,

54
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.770
but we'd been anchored into video game pricing,

55
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.350
even ignoring inflation.

56
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:22.150
We didn't talk about how games also now take longer to develop with way more

57
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:22.780
staff.

58
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.430
And the technology itself is a lot better with 4k graphics and smooth frame

59
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:31.420
rates, wireless controllers, full games. You can buy, download,

60
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:35.860
and play basically right away from your couch without having to beg your mom to

61
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:40.090
drive you to KB toys at the South side mall and Oneonta an hour round trip in a

62
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.250
sudden snowstorm to get a game, you know,

63
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.540
next to nothing about aside from having drooled over the same 10 screenshots in

64
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:48.610
game pro magazine for the last six spots.

65
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.670
But that game was Xeno gears and it was totally

66
00:03:53.671 --> 00:03:57.420
worth it. And anchoring happens with stuff like movies,

67
00:03:57.421 --> 00:04:02.370
how a movie opens and ends bookend anchoring has a

68
00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.140
stronger influence on what you think of it. Have you ever heard someone say,

69
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.860
yeah, the beginning and end of that movie were terrible,

70
00:04:10.861 --> 00:04:13.320
but the middle was really good.

71
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.120
No coin flipping muscle Pia tele Palm Maurine flipped a coin

72
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.130
seven times and the outcome was one of these three sequences,

73
00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.270
heads, heads, heads, heads, tails, tails, tails, tails, heads, heads, tails,

74
00:04:27.271 --> 00:04:31.230
heads, tails, tails, tails, tails, tails, tails, tails, tails, tails.

75
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.550
The question is which one is most likely to be the real outcome?

76
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.840
Let's say you had to bet on it. It costs you 10 bucks if you were wrong.

77
00:04:39.841 --> 00:04:43.320
And if you were right you on 30 bucks, when a group was pulled,

78
00:04:43.321 --> 00:04:48.240
the top choice was sequence two followed by one and then

79
00:04:48.241 --> 00:04:50.940
three for all the wrong reasons.

80
00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:55.890
The probabilities of all three sequences are exactly the same

81
00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.750
because each coin flip is an independent event with 50 50 odds of

82
00:05:00.751 --> 00:05:05.640
heads or tails seven tails in a row is just as likely to

83
00:05:05.641 --> 00:05:10.260
occur as a mix of tails and heads in the second series.

84
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.270
But since we're anchored into thinking,

85
00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:16.530
there's typically an alternating mix of heads and tails and a sequence of seven

86
00:05:16.531 --> 00:05:17.400
coin tosses.

87
00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:21.810
We wrongly believe it's actually more likely

88
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.943
[inaudible] dice.

89
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.510
I've painted four sides of this dye green and the other two sides, red,

90
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.410
same bedding terms as the coin flip game, lose 10 bucks if you're wrong.

91
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.540
When 30 bucks, if you're right, which outcome is more likely red, green, red,

92
00:05:39.541 --> 00:05:44.250
red, red, green, red, green, red, red, red, green, red, red,

93
00:05:44.251 --> 00:05:46.890
red, red, red, when people were polled,

94
00:05:46.891 --> 00:05:51.690
choice preferences also went to one and three.

95
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.190
That is weird.

96
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.610
None of the three sequences are all that common because they're so red,

97
00:05:58.611 --> 00:06:03.230
heavy and red is only two of the six sides of the dye.

98
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.580
But our cognitive bias tells us to choose the second

99
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.180
sequence because it's got a nice little mix. A nice,

100
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.670
I don't know why I did that.

101
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.270
It's got a nice little mix of red and green,

102
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:22.310
even though the first sequence is actually contained in the

103
00:06:22.311 --> 00:06:27.080
second one. Look at this red, green, red, red, red, red, green, red, red,

104
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:27.800
red.

105
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.570
Why would it ever be easier to add an additional throw to make the

106
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:36.860
sequence more likely? It isn't. The more throws you make,

107
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:40.910
the less likely you are to hit that exact sequence.

108
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.923
Here's the math.

109
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.060
We're really just multiplying the odds of one over three for red and two over

110
00:06:47.061 --> 00:06:50.990
three for green, but check out the relative probabilities,

111
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.190
just one swap from red to green in sequence. Number two,

112
00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.380
doubles the probability of sequence number three and not requiring that

113
00:07:00.381 --> 00:07:01.880
extra green throw in.

114
00:07:01.881 --> 00:07:06.860
Number one makes it about 60% more likely to happen compared

115
00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:10.370
to sequence. Number two, anchoring costs you money.

116
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.540
The next time you're shopping and you see something that's 1999. Yeah.

117
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.240
20 bucks sounds a lot more expensive,

118
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.850
even though it's just a penny difference,

119
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:24.500
but that 99 cents also anchors you into thinking about the

120
00:07:24.501 --> 00:07:27.290
price in an interval of pennies.

121
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.000
So sales and holding dollars off seems more appealing. Look,

122
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.540
if a car sticker price is $18,000,

123
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.980
even you might counter with $15,000 even,

124
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:44.630
but a car at $17,800 is meant to anchor you into

125
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.620
countering in hundreds, not thousands.

126
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.360
I began this video with this multiplication example because it's the clearest

127
00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:58.010
illustration of how anchoring bias can lead to groups with the same

128
00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:02.810
information, just presented differently to reach totally different

129
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.310
conclusions. Both of which were dramatically wrong.

130
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.710
Anchoring is a good thing.

131
00:08:09.711 --> 00:08:13.490
It's a first impression we have to start somewhere if we're ever going to

132
00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:17.870
process any information in a meaningful or efficient

133
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:23.240
way, but it can definitely lead you down the wrong path and without

134
00:08:23.241 --> 00:08:25.760
recognizing what it is. And isn't,

135
00:08:25.761 --> 00:08:30.050
you just have no hope of overcoming its effects,

136
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.250
but by acknowledging, anchoring bias,

137
00:08:34.251 --> 00:08:38.630
your armed with the ability to choose how much weight to give it,

138
00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:40.370
you can stick with the good,

139
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.850
accurate anchors that lead you down the right roads.

140
00:08:43.851 --> 00:08:48.650
And you can transcend those that otherwise would have caused you to

141
00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.050
get it really wrong.

142
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.130
The truth is that depending on the question,

143
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.820
the real answer might still be just floating

144
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.430
around, waiting for someone,

145
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:07.830
someone like you to finally anchor it.

146
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.520
