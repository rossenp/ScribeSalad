00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.070
<v 0>The sauce. Kevin here with a message about your online existence.</v>

2
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.470
Social media is a venomous snake pit of linguistic diarrhea

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.240
and keyboard garbage because no one can agree on what

4
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.320
knowledge is actually knowledge,

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.690
no matter what the post or video or tweet or argument is

6
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:27.540
about. No matter what side they're on,

7
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:29.790
no matter what they believe,

8
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.970
someone else knows they're wrong,

9
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.880
they don't know anything.

10
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.400
How can two people be both so confident that they know something

11
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.510
when they've reached totally different conclusions,

12
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.480
obviously, right?

13
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.850
Weird. Is that it seems pretty simple to know something. I mean,

14
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.680
you just know it,

15
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.080
you know it because you have some kind of relevant experience or, you know,

16
00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:06.980
someone who does, and they transferred that knowledge to you,

17
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.780
or maybe you've read something you trust or you know,

18
00:01:11.781 --> 00:01:15.650
that what an expert in a particular field says is valid.

19
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.200
However, it comes to you,

20
00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:22.730
that information is an accurate description of the way the

21
00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:27.650
world is that's knowledge. Right?

22
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.953
Right.

23
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.000
Sometimes the way we tend to think about knowledge is in terms of justified

24
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.050
true belief,

25
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.400
a concept that goes back to Plato's dialogue between Socrates and

26
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.150
Theotis in three 69 BC,

27
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.590
and was actually refined and codified by 20th century philosophers,

28
00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:51.020
it's a little more modern than it seems,

29
00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:54.950
but it's exactly what it sounds like to know something you need to have

30
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.780
justification for what sort of evidence tells you it's

31
00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:00.200
right.

32
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.060
Is there enough of it are the odds in its favor and it needs

33
00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:09.860
to be true. Is it reality for you and for others?

34
00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:12.770
Does it really hold up to scrutiny?

35
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.520
Truth is pretty weird in that it's metaphysical.

36
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:21.140
It's about how things are not necessarily what you see.

37
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.400
We don't even have to verify something for it to be true,

38
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.340
quick pick heads or tails go.

39
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.510
I'm never, ever going to look at the result of this coin flip,

40
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.220
but half of you predicted the true outcome,

41
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.400
and then you've got to leave it and you have to recognize it as being

42
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.720
true and justified. Look, here's a very simple example.

43
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.640
You look at a clock to find out the time because clocks tell

44
00:02:55.641 --> 00:03:00.400
time you're justified in thinking a clock is going to tell you

45
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.520
the time the clock says 3:00 PM,

46
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.820
which you believe because it's always been right for,

47
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:08.740
and this is what clocks do.

48
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.870
It's true because it's actually 3:00 PM. So congratulations.

49
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:16.090
You know, it's 3:00 PM.

50
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.910
All of this makes sense.

51
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:23.440
What I've just described as a formal examination of what we

52
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.380
all do pretty much all the time,

53
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.120
but I can prove your justified true

54
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:35.860
belief. Your knowledge can be an illusion for

55
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:37.720
thousands of years.

56
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.460
Understanding of what knowledge is was considered etched in stone

57
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.020
case closed until in 1963, philosopher,

58
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.850
Edmund GetEater wrote a short three page paper that completely

59
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:55.180
smashed the justified true belief simulation.

60
00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.130
It was such a shift in how we think about knowledge that philosopher

61
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.950
Alvin Plantinga said 1993,

62
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.400
that knowledge is justified. True belief.

63
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.900
So thought from time in Memorial, then God said,

64
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.650
let Getty or be not quite all was light, perhaps,

65
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:19.540
but at any rate we learned, we had been standing in a dark corner.

66
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.450
How getting your claimed that we can satisfy all three

67
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.190
of those conditions and still not actually know something.

68
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.130
Let's revisit our clock example.

69
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.570
We looked at a clock that read 3:00 PM and had knowledge.

70
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.680
It was 3:00 PM because it satisfied. Plato's justified,

71
00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:43.480
true belief definition.

72
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.820
What if the clock was broken and stuck at 3:00 PM?

73
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.980
Do you actually know the time from looking at a broken

74
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:57.730
clock, even if it's accidentally, correct?

75
00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.590
No. Like N O no, not Kenya. No.

76
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.880
W no, no. That is justified.

77
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.240
True belief without knowledge.

78
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.110
That is a Getty or provenance, or think of it like this.

79
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.260
There is a cat in this YouTube video out in

80
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.690
sheriff cat here. Ah,

81
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.860
just mosey down into this too big town to restore a bit of order.

82
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.110
You see this here, wobbling John tender.

83
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.410
Foot's been yarn in the hours away with too much mustard.

84
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.110
And I am the set thing straight of aura.

85
00:05:34.111 --> 00:05:37.350
The whole corral turns into a bag of nuts.

86
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.400
I haven't been outside in four months. Anyway,

87
00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:47.730
there's a cat in this YouTube video. You know,

88
00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:51.630
there's a YouTube video because you're watching me record it.

89
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.940
You're on YouTube right now. Your looking at sheriff cat,

90
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.860
you're justified in thinking there's a cat in this video,

91
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:03.890
you can decide it's true with confidence.

92
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.990
And you believe what your seeing, everything here adds up

93
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.250
and you were right. There has been a cat in this video this whole time.

94
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.410
You were just right for the wrong reasons. And yeah,

95
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:25.220
you were right. But did you know it is that knowledge,

96
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.250
is that knowledge Luna they'll figure it out.

97
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.180
They'll figure out what knowledge is. No, of course. It's not knowledge.

98
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.620
You knew nothing. You had a justified true belief.

99
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.630
It was accurate, but it wasn't. So even when you're right,

100
00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:45.830
how do you know you're not actually wrong? This calls into question,

101
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:49.880
the scientific method, what we think we know about the natural world,

102
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.480
everything given the ease and prevalence of Getty or problems,

103
00:06:53.481 --> 00:06:55.910
we can't possibly know anything. Right?

104
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:07.003
Hello.

105
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.920
<v 2>Wrong. Well, mostly wrong.</v>

106
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:17.620
This is how it actually works. Okay. As scientists,

107
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.090
we have a hypothesis.

108
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.810
We wonder if something is true or not true.

109
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.700
We propose an experiment. If the experiment supports the hypothesis,

110
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.480
they would say, well, maybe my idea was true,

111
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:36.640
but I could be biased. Maybe there's a flaw in my experiment.

112
00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:42.160
Maybe the electrical current had a glitch in the mid point of taking

113
00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:42.880
data.

114
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.450
<v 0>Yeah. But that's exactly the kind of uncertainty I'm talking about.</v>

115
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.880
<v 2>I experiment again,</v>

116
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:53.620
I try to design a different kind of experiment to test for the same idea.

117
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.260
I get a colleague of mine to test it.

118
00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.930
I get them to come up with a new kind of experiment.

119
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:02.420
I get a competitor of mine to,

120
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:07.390
to try to show that I'm wrong with an experimental design of

121
00:08:07.391 --> 00:08:08.224
their own.

122
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:14.050
And if all of those experiments give approximately the

123
00:08:14.051 --> 00:08:17.800
same answer, because there will be statistical variation,

124
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.790
I think it was approximately the same answer. We're onto something. Okay.

125
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:22.811
<v 0>Okay. Okay.</v>

126
00:08:22.811 --> 00:08:27.040
So in science you take what seems to be knowledge and then start to eliminate

127
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:31.000
all those other possibilities to distill what you think, you know.

128
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.950
<v 2>In the methods and tools of science as they're applied to that question.</v>

129
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.670
Right? So we learn earth goes around the sun.

130
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.960
That's not going to later on be shown to be false ever,

131
00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.500
ever. We got that one.

132
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.550
Now you can ask more refined questions. Okay.

133
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.020
What kind of orbit does it have? Is it a perfect circle?

134
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.890
It's a good approximation, but it's not exactly right.

135
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:06.360
So you can ask deeper questions. Yes. It does go around the sun.

136
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.470
What kind of a circle is it? Is it a squash circle? Is it a long gated?

137
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:11.304
Is it that?

138
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.110
And you keep doing this and what you end up doing is refining the answer to the

139
00:09:16.111 --> 00:09:21.090
question to a level that satisfies your needs in the

140
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:21.924
moment.

141
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.030
<v 0>Yes. So that's how knowledge builds and expands.</v>

142
00:09:25.031 --> 00:09:29.660
So maybe it's not so much what we don't know as what we

143
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:31.580
keep finding out.

144
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:36.140
<v 2>So you can say, well, we never know anything. Yes.</v>

145
00:09:36.141 --> 00:09:39.290
We know a lot of things. Will we ever know anything.

146
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:41.870
<v 0>Perfectly? Well.</v>

147
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.980
<v 2>There are certain things you can ask where you're just counting things. Yes.</v>

148
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.840
You can note perfectly.

149
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:52.070
There's certain crystals where we know exactly where all the atoms are,

150
00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.560
where all the atoms are and we can count them.

151
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.970
We know exactly how many atoms there aren't a crystal, certain crystals. Yes.

152
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.050
There are certain answers that are precise, but if it involves a measurement,

153
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.560
no, you can, it can be ever more refined,

154
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.690
but there could be a point where more refinement just doesn't matter to

155
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.230
the aspect of the answer that you're seeking.

156
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:20.990
So in science, we are perfectly content when multiple experiments agree,

157
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.960
even if the philosopher isn't, even if the philosopher is distracted,

158
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:30.650
by the possibility that there might be a deeper truth

159
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.330
lurking within the data that we have accumulated,

160
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.560
I don't have a problem with it.

161
00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:39.110
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

162
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:44.000
I guess we can hit a point where we know as much as we want to or need

163
00:10:44.001 --> 00:10:46.700
to. And when we hit the end like that,

164
00:10:46.701 --> 00:10:49.820
we've moved on to something else.

165
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.130
<v 2>Science is a continuous journey</v>

166
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:58.310
through the main of nature. And,

167
00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:02.750
but not all information is equally uncertain. That's my only point here.

168
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.720
And so we know how to fly.

169
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:09.800
We know how wheels work well in all the other machines in physics,

170
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.260
we know how electricity works. We have,

171
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.470
this is why we can use a phone.

172
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:20.120
I got an old fashioned phone here. It's an I, this works to say,

173
00:11:20.121 --> 00:11:24.320
we can't really know. We do know. That's why, that's why you're living longer.

174
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.770
That's why so many things are different about your life today,

175
00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:30.020
then how your ancestors live.

176
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.790
Because the methods and tools of science have been applied to questions that

177
00:11:34.791 --> 00:11:38.060
curious people have asked for, for the most part,

178
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:42.860
for the betterment of society and for civilization. So, so no,

179
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:47.570
I'm not going to wallow in some prospect that we can never know

180
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.650
anything we do.

181
00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.670
And if you want to think way, just move back to the cave.

182
00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.530
Cause that's really where you belong.

183
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.560
<v 0>Nah, I like, uh, indoor plumbing. Hey Neil. Uh, while I've got you,</v>

184
00:12:01.561 --> 00:12:05.580
there's a question that's been killing me for years. It's very,

185
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:06.863
very simple.

186
00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.230
<v 2>You got a question after all that. Okay. What is.</v>

187
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:14.640
<v 0>Okay, ready is a hot dog, a sandwich.</v>

188
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:20.700
<v 2>I have vowed many years ago to never</v>

189
00:12:20.701 --> 00:12:24.600
get into an argument with someone of the definition of a word,

190
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.830
all kinds of people love doing this. I remember growing up,

191
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.460
is it a gum or is it a candy? Is it lighter? Is it less filling?

192
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.770
Is I'm saying, no,

193
00:12:34.771 --> 00:12:39.690
I'm not going there because ideas matter to me more than

194
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:43.290
the words we come up with to describe them.

195
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.230
<v 0>Okay. But I need to know, we need to categorize this.</v>

196
00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:49.470
<v 2>Just because the brain is, is, is but yours,</v>

197
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:53.190
but all of our collective brains want to categorize things.

198
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.940
And if something spilled out of one category, we fight about where it belongs.

199
00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:01.830
I'm saying, no, I'm not having that fight. I'm not having that fight. In fact,

200
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.350
if you want to go there, just invent a new category,

201
00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:09.780
call it the hot dog category. Okay?

202
00:13:09.781 --> 00:13:14.340
It's not a sandwich. It's a don't get up. I'd be happy with that. Otherwise, no,

203
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.690
I'm not spending time arguing.

204
00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:24.270
Is it a non bread food sitting between two surfaces of bread?

205
00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:26.813
It's a sandwich.

206
00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.110
<v 0>Ha, there you have it. So this wasn't even plugged into anything. Anyway,</v>

207
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:39.300
the Getty, your problem exists and knowledge is a lot more complicated

208
00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.630
than it seems. Excuse me, sheriff cat, happy trails.

209
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:46.530
Sometimes knowledge is straightforward and irrefutable.

210
00:13:46.531 --> 00:13:48.420
Sometimes it's murky.

211
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:52.050
Sometimes we're right and wrong at the same time.

212
00:13:52.051 --> 00:13:56.580
And sometimes we hit the practical limits of our curiosity and

213
00:13:57.030 --> 00:14:01.050
shouldn't really bother getting any more granular than that.

214
00:14:01.051 --> 00:14:05.320
Like Neil says at a certain point, it's time to move on.

215
00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.050
And till we decide,

216
00:14:07.051 --> 00:14:11.040
we need to go back in 1972,

217
00:14:11.041 --> 00:14:12.150
WV Quine,

218
00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:17.070
who I referenced in the what is a paradox video wrote an essay specifically

219
00:14:17.071 --> 00:14:21.330
dedicated to the limits of knowledge. He opens it by asking,

220
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:25.140
are there things that man can never know?

221
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:26.940
And Roger Shattuck,

222
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:31.590
a writer and literary professor explored the consequences of understanding

223
00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.610
24 years later in his book, forbidden knowledge,

224
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:40.680
including starting off the entire thing with a seminal question to the human

225
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:41.610
experience.

226
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:46.260
Are there things we should not know?

227
00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:51.650
And what about Getty or who inspired a revolution in how think

228
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.410
about thought philosopher.

229
00:14:54.411 --> 00:14:59.300
John L Polich concluded that Getty or single handedly changed. The course.

230
00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:03.520
<v 3>Systemology get yours 92 years old.</v>

231
00:15:03.521 --> 00:15:07.990
Now he never published another thing after that paper,

232
00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:13.180
not a word when asked why all he said was I have

233
00:15:13.181 --> 00:15:14.650
nothing more to say,

234
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:19.540
apparently also invented the mic drop.

235
00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:20.883
It's been.

236
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.400
<v 0>24 Years since Shaddox book.</v>

237
00:15:24.401 --> 00:15:29.230
And my answer to all the questions asked by Shaddock

238
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:34.090
Quine giddier and Plato is, I don't know.

239
00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.360
And yes, social media is nuts.

240
00:15:37.361 --> 00:15:40.780
But the other day I was reading a thread by Simon [inaudible].

241
00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:45.280
He's a professor at Carnegie Mellon and runs the laboratory for social minds at

242
00:15:45.281 --> 00:15:46.720
the Santa Fe Institute,

243
00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:51.610
he was talking about knowledge and justified true belief. And he said,

244
00:15:51.611 --> 00:15:56.560
one reason he likes doing science with others is because they can help him

245
00:15:56.561 --> 00:15:58.150
disprove something.

246
00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:02.740
He believes more efficiently than he can himself.

247
00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:07.780
He said that works best because we need help in exploring the

248
00:16:07.781 --> 00:16:10.600
unknown. If you're walking in the woods,

249
00:16:10.601 --> 00:16:15.430
you can either walk towards a landmark or away walking

250
00:16:15.431 --> 00:16:17.110
away for some reason.

251
00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.690
<v 3>Seems to work better. That's what we're.</v>

252
00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:20.980
<v 0>Doing all the time,</v>

253
00:16:20.981 --> 00:16:25.030
where identifying the known and exploring the unknown.

254
00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:30.670
We struggle with imperfect knowledge and whether it's science,

255
00:16:30.671 --> 00:16:35.260
philosophy, cats, or hotdogs to get to where we're going.

256
00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.480
Sometimes you just need to walk away and as

257
00:16:40.481 --> 00:16:42.040
always, thanks for watching.

258
00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:48.880
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

259
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:53.680
<v 0>So sheriff cat, do you arrest like humans or you just arrest other cats?</v>

260
00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.830
Do rescue dogs. Like how does this work?

261
00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.770
<v 1>Hold on. Hello.</v>

262
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:05.320
<v 0>You can watch more of Neil and I discussing the boundaries of knowledge and</v>

263
00:17:05.321 --> 00:17:07.690
science over on star talk.

264
00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:12.730
Make sure you subscribe to star talk while you're there. It is wonderful.

265
00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:17.590
Also the summer curiosity box has dropped and you can start thinking

266
00:17:17.591 --> 00:17:22.090
now by getting yours@curiositybox.com it's made by

267
00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:26.140
the sauce, and this is the subscription for thinkers.

268
00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.850
So basically.

269
00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:32.080
<v 1>Bye.</v>
