00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.890
<v 0>Vsauce Merlin here. And I know everything about what, you know,</v>

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.840
and think everything I've built a vacation home in your

3
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:14.520
mind, and I'm lounging by the pool, sipping chocolate milk right now.

4
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.390
And I can prove it with a little magic that amazed TV audiences worldwide,

5
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.370
by having them rub their fingers all over their screens.

6
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.110
It starts with a clock and each of the 12 numbers are arranged.

7
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.370
As you'd expect.

8
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.680
You'll be moving around this clock in a way that's random to me,

9
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.930
you'll know which numbers you choose along the way, but I won't.

10
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.380
How could I, your wherever you are.

11
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:51.150
And I'm in my mom's basement right

12
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.690
wrong while I am in my mom's basement.

13
00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:59.580
But with the power of my fake wizard beard, no matter what number you choose,

14
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.880
I will know where you are

15
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.560
now. Clear your mind of its usual. Thoughts, memes, pizza,

16
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:14.100
rolls, energy drinks, and select a number.

17
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:18.840
It can be any number from one to 12 and only you will

18
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:22.290
know what it is. Ready? Go pick.

19
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.123
<v 1>A number.</v>

20
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.310
<v 0>Got a number. Good. Now I need you to spell your number,</v>

21
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.820
starting at 12 and moving clockwise.

22
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.910
One step for each letter in the word.

23
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.190
If your secret number is seven, then you'd move five steps.

24
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.750
S E V E N.

25
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.550
And land on a five. If you pick a 11 you'd move,

26
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.750
six steps,

27
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.160
E L E V E N.

28
00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.600
And land on the six. Hold your finger over the screen,

29
00:02:00.601 --> 00:02:05.220
starting at 12 and count your numbers letters until you're on

30
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.740
your new number. Okay, go ahead.

31
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.780
All right. Now, spell your new number,

32
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.100
moving one position clockwise for each letter in that number.

33
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.510
If you're on the three, then move five spaces.

34
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.890
T H R E E.

35
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.670
If you're on the sixth, then move three spaces.

36
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.640
S I X,

37
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.700
if you run out of spaces and get back to the 12,

38
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:44.600
just keep going around the same way. Clock's hands move.

39
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.823
<v 1>Okay.</v>

40
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.100
Did you do it? We're going to do this one more time. Spell it.

41
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.340
<v 0>Your new number again, and then stop.</v>

42
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.250
I'll give a second to do that.

43
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.830
Okay. Now I have no idea what number you started with,

44
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.770
or the second one you landed on.

45
00:03:13.771 --> 00:03:17.490
Let alone the third number that you landed on after that.

46
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.350
But I do know that you are not on the

47
00:03:22.351 --> 00:03:25.020
two, so I'm going to get rid of that.

48
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.060
And I know that you're not on the four either

49
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.370
or the eight or the 12

50
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.900
as I sit my delicious chocolate milk next to your mind pool.

51
00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:44.520
I can see that you weren't on any of those numbers so we don't need them.

52
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.640
Yay. Let's go one more round.

53
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.710
Spell your new number and skip the empty spaces.

54
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.040
One letter, one position and stop. When you're done.

55
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.180
If you're on the five, you'll move four spaces,

56
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.050
F I V E skipping,

57
00:04:07.051 --> 00:04:10.440
the empty eight space and landing on the 10.

58
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.113
<v 1>Go ahead.</v>

59
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.680
<v 0>Are you on the 10? No, no, no.</v>

60
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.070
You are not on the 10. So the 10 is gone.

61
00:04:26.071 --> 00:04:30.360
Your on the three. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

62
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.310
You are not on the three.

63
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.500
That's gone to then nine gone or the one

64
00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.830
gone your on

65
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.820
the six and you've just witnessed the magic of the

66
00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:51.270
Kruskal count heart hall. The spirit is really getting a cheat.

67
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.600
This has a super tight one second. Let me pull up.

68
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.800
Oh, the troubles of having a beard.

69
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.550
Oh, that's better.

70
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.260
So magician David Copperfield has performed illusions with several different

71
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:11.310
variations of this trick from using a clock face to

72
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.520
celebrities, to vacation destinations.

73
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.500
He mesmerized audiences in live shows and TV shows with

74
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.570
his predictive power.

75
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.610
But the man who discovered the Kruskal count was mathematician and physicist

76
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.900
Martin Kruskal who took some delight in knowing that it often

77
00:05:30.901 --> 00:05:35.880
confused actual magicians because it wasn't based on any

78
00:05:35.881 --> 00:05:40.410
kind of slight of hand or it was based on math.

79
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.950
So what is actually going on here?

80
00:05:43.951 --> 00:05:47.160
Let's let's dissect what happens in the clock trick.

81
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.530
You're starting at 12 and you have four possible moves numbers

82
00:05:52.531 --> 00:05:55.800
that contain three, four, five,

83
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.690
or six letters. You've got 12 numbers to choose from,

84
00:05:59.691 --> 00:06:03.170
but we only have four possible pathways forward.

85
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:06.860
And therefore I know no matter what number you choose,

86
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:09.620
you'll end up on the three, four,

87
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.940
five or six after your first move for your second move.

88
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:18.620
You'll either move five, four, four, or three,

89
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.840
which means that every single player winds up on either the eight or the nine

90
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.940
notice at no point in the game, can anyone even land on the two, seven,

91
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.620
10, 11, or 12? I know that before we start,

92
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:36.440
but you probably won't notice it as you play.

93
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:41.000
And along the way I remind you that these choices are yours and are

94
00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:45.260
totally random to me because reinforcing that randomness

95
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:50.300
distracts you from thinking about any pattern that you might

96
00:06:50.301 --> 00:06:54.020
be encountering on the third move. If you're on the eight,

97
00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:58.550
you'll move five spaces to the one. If you're on the nine,

98
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.720
you'll move four spaces to the one and that's it.

99
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.900
It's already game over for you and you didn't even know it.

100
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.060
Then the performance really starts. I could take away numbers like two,

101
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.190
four, eight, and 12,

102
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.140
because I know for a fact that you're on the one it's 100%

103
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.003
guaranteed,

104
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:24.410
but there's a very subtle element to choosing which numbers to

105
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.690
erase. Those four removes numbers have letter values of three, four,

106
00:07:29.691 --> 00:07:31.250
five, and six.

107
00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:35.810
So that subconsciously reinforces that I'm not eliminating some

108
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:37.970
specific element or pattern,

109
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:42.950
like just removing all of the possibilities with three letters.

110
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:46.670
It's spread out among the choices. So to you,

111
00:07:46.671 --> 00:07:50.030
it seems just that much more random. Really.

112
00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:54.350
I can do anything once you're all on the one. I don't have to do anything.

113
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:58.490
If we just kept playing, you'd all just go from the one to the four.

114
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.990
I could also add in as many rounds as I wanted, because you're all.

115
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.010
<v 2>Sync at that point, or I can.</v>

116
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.010
<v 0>Move different numbers to get you to the final.</v>

117
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.140
<v 2>Number. That's best positioned on camera,</v>

118
00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:16.360
which is probably why Copperfield wanted to land on the six in the center

119
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.830
of the screen. It just looked better on TV. So great.

120
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.800
We figured out the trick kind of,

121
00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:26.230
not exactly.

122
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.580
<v 0>What is happening here. Put Kruskal discovered was that a counting game.</v>

123
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.150
<v 2>Like this is really a chain of numbers.</v>

124
00:08:34.151 --> 00:08:37.090
Every new number is a new link in the chain.

125
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.140
And when two chains eventually intersect on the same link,

126
00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.860
then they become the same chain from there on out,

127
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.390
knowing that you can appear to predict a highly improbable

128
00:08:49.391 --> 00:08:53.770
result. Even when you don't know where the chain.

129
00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.040
<v 1>Began. Let.</v>

130
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.000
<v 0>Me show you another example.</v>

131
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:02.670
The predictive power of cross-culture count is seen most easily with a deck of

132
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:03.091
cards.

133
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:07.980
So allow me to show you my wonderful Wiener dogs,

134
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:11.940
playing cards. I'll shuffle a full wonderful Wiener dogs,

135
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:15.180
deck of 52 cards and deal out 10.

136
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:20.160
You need to choose one of these 10 cards. Obviously.

137
00:09:20.161 --> 00:09:24.630
I won't know which one you choose because I recorded this video in the past and

138
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:28.410
you're watching it in your present, which is my future.

139
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:33.390
Then you'll proceed to count forward from that card until we

140
00:09:33.391 --> 00:09:35.610
get through the whole deck.

141
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.890
ACEs count as one and face cards count as five and every

142
00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:45.030
other card counts as the numerical value, it displays.

143
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.710
So like nine equals nine. So if you choose to start with card,

144
00:09:49.711 --> 00:09:54.300
number five, that's a queen, which is worth five and you'll go five spaces,

145
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:59.490
one, two, three, four, five, and land on the ACE,

146
00:09:59.491 --> 00:10:04.230
which is one. So then you'll go one land on a King, which is five one,

147
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:09.360
two, three, four, five land on a 10, and then you'll go 10.

148
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.980
Got it. And you'll continue this until you can't make a full move.

149
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.870
So if you land on this nine,

150
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.200
you obviously can't go nine spaces.

151
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:22.110
So this nine would be your final card.

152
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.640
And even though I don't know what car you picked to start,

153
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:31.380
I'll be able to tell you which card is the last one in your

154
00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:32.214
sequence.

155
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.930
Here's how I'll also choose a number from one to

156
00:10:36.931 --> 00:10:41.010
10. Let's say I pick four, which is a four.

157
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.430
The fourth card will be my first link in the chain,

158
00:10:44.431 --> 00:10:49.230
which Kruskal called a key card and together without telling each

159
00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:52.500
other, because I don't know which card you're starting with.

160
00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:57.090
We're both going to count forward from our respective cards

161
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.120
since I'm starting on the fourth card, which is a,

162
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:05.100
for all count for spaces to another card, one, two, three,

163
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.840
four, which is a five. And continue until the end.

164
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.060
You'll do the same thing for your mystery card.

165
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:17.250
And then it's a it's Wiener time. Okay, go ahead. Let's start.

166
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:46.910
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

167
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:50.690
<v 0>Last card in the sequence is that nine,</v>

168
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.850
because so is mine using the Kruskal count?

169
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.860
I can predict what your final card will be without knowing where you started,

170
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:03.040
because it doesn't really matter at a certain point,

171
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:07.960
our chains intersected on the same key card and followed

172
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:12.970
the same path to the end. And this always works.

173
00:12:12.971 --> 00:12:14.140
Doesn't it? No,

174
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:19.030
it doesn't about one in six of you are already typing a rage

175
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:24.520
soaked comment about how dumb I am for choosing the wrong number and

176
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.290
jokes on you, buddy, because I knew that would happen.

177
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.330
The cross schools count with a 52 card deck only works about

178
00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.940
85% of the time.

179
00:12:35.941 --> 00:12:39.570
And if our final key cards weren't the same,

180
00:12:39.571 --> 00:12:43.230
then you chose one of the numbers that put you on one of the

181
00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:48.150
15% of chains that land me in the fail

182
00:12:48.151 --> 00:12:52.140
category, but the longer our chains go,

183
00:12:52.141 --> 00:12:54.690
the more chances they have to intersect.

184
00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:58.470
So if we played two decks of 52 cards,

185
00:12:58.471 --> 00:13:03.330
the odds of me predicting the right final card for you jumped to

186
00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:08.580
95%, let's just see exactly how this can play out.

187
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:13.530
I'll shuffle and deal another 10 cards, color code them and Mark each chains.

188
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:14.970
Key cards. As you can see,

189
00:13:14.971 --> 00:13:19.140
five out of the 10 cards linked up right away on this nine,

190
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.240
and then ended up on this 10,

191
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:25.860
the fourth and ninth cards linked up on this seven and then met up with the

192
00:13:25.861 --> 00:13:27.210
others on this queen.

193
00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:32.490
But three of the 10 just kind of did their own thing and converged on a second

194
00:13:32.491 --> 00:13:34.410
mini chain, the fifth, eighth,

195
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:39.390
and 10th cards linked up together on this Jack and ended up on a six.

196
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.710
There are a couple of reasons for this first landing on a couple of nines caused

197
00:13:43.711 --> 00:13:47.040
huge jumps that reduced chain link opportunities.

198
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.930
The more key cards in a sequence,

199
00:13:48.931 --> 00:13:52.350
the more opportunities to overlap with the main chain.

200
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.300
If we played with two or three decks,

201
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:58.350
our big chain and little chain would be almost certain to converge,

202
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.820
but this game ended up being a weird outlier where the magician had a much

203
00:14:02.821 --> 00:14:06.210
smaller chance of success than they usually would.

204
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:11.190
That's the way we know that this isn't magic magic works

205
00:14:11.191 --> 00:14:14.970
100% of the time because it's engineered and

206
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.840
manufactured to be successful probability.

207
00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.450
Isn't quite as predictable.

208
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:25.800
There's actually a great interactive version by Alex Friedan and Ravi Montenegro

209
00:14:25.801 --> 00:14:30.540
from the university of Massachusetts mole that you can play online and I'll link

210
00:14:30.541 --> 00:14:34.410
below because I like you. Yeah. This is a fun,

211
00:14:34.411 --> 00:14:39.000
little trick that you can use to mess with your little brother's mind. But

212
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:45.000
what's the point. The Kruskal count feels like magic,

213
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.480
but is considered a probabilistic paradox.

214
00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.980
Technically speaking, it's a vertical one and.

215
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.720
<v 2>It has real world computational applications in</v>

216
00:14:56.721 --> 00:14:59.930
1978, John Pollard applied it to code,

217
00:14:59.931 --> 00:15:04.550
breaking and developed a Lambda method for catching kangaroos.

218
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.360
Also known as the kangaroo algorithm,

219
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:12.320
which is a great name for an algorithm.

220
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:13.821
But to me,

221
00:15:13.821 --> 00:15:18.800
the trick is an incredible illustration of how math can be at

222
00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:20.720
the heart of coincidence.

223
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:25.430
What are the chances you run into your old gym teacher at the

224
00:15:25.431 --> 00:15:26.270
supermarket?

225
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.490
What are the odds that you end up going to the same college as the bigger

226
00:15:31.491 --> 00:15:34.100
boy who moved away in first grade,

227
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:39.320
we're all living in different systems at the same time,

228
00:15:39.321 --> 00:15:43.430
some large, some small, some open, some closed.

229
00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:48.290
And every one of our actions is another

230
00:15:48.291 --> 00:15:51.260
link in our own chains.

231
00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:56.930
What we call fate or coincidence may really be the result of a

232
00:15:56.931 --> 00:15:58.850
hidden mathematical master,

233
00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:04.130
pulling the probability puppet strings of our existences together.

234
00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:10.130
At which point we can decide how closely we want to align our

235
00:16:10.131 --> 00:16:12.410
chains from that point on,

236
00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.630
which is cool because you probably don't want to go home with your old

237
00:16:17.631 --> 00:16:18.530
gym teacher,

238
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:24.320
especially since he saw you buy cat food and you don't even

239
00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:29.240
have a cat and as always, thanks for watching.

240
00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:37.330
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

241
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.420
<v 2>Do you live in a country? Yes, you do.</v>

242
00:16:40.421 --> 00:16:44.950
Do you want to watch things in a different country? Yeah, of course you do,

243
00:16:44.951 --> 00:16:48.640
but you can't, you are region restricted.

244
00:16:48.641 --> 00:16:53.110
And if you're traveling abroad, but want to watch stuff from your native land,

245
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.590
forget about it, depending on where you are,

246
00:16:56.591 --> 00:17:00.880
you might not even be allowed to watch Vsauce two,

247
00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:05.110
which is the saddest thing humanly possible.

248
00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:09.700
So how are you even seeing this right now? You're using Nord VPN,

249
00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:14.410
thanks to them for sponsoring this video and supporting Vsauce to and

250
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:19.360
allowing people in countries that literally block YouTube to

251
00:17:19.361 --> 00:17:21.160
watch my videos.

252
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.850
Nord VPN has remote servers all over the world.

253
00:17:24.851 --> 00:17:27.130
So when you connect to one of their servers,

254
00:17:27.131 --> 00:17:31.720
it makes your IP address look like you're in another

255
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:34.750
country. And regardless of how far the server is,

256
00:17:34.751 --> 00:17:36.640
the speed won't be compromised.

257
00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.810
You could even get higher speeds than normal as your ISP. Won't be limiting it.

258
00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:45.220
And therefore you can watch what you want to watch,

259
00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:50.250
what you deserve to watch, which is a win for Liberty.

260
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:54.480
So to get 70% off in one month free, go to Nord,

00:17:54.481 --> 00:17:57.570
vpn.com/vsauce two,

262
00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:02.460
or just use my very fancy coupon code Vsauce

263
00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:05.040
two and access entertainment.

264
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.820
That region restrictions are locking you out.

265
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:13.290
You can grab the three-year plan and Norton will be giving surprise gifts to

266
00:18:13.291 --> 00:18:17.520
their customers as they're celebrating their eighth birthday this month.

267
00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.430
<v 3>Bye it's just Chile.</v>
