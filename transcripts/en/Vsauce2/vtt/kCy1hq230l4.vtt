00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.350
<v 0>The sauce. Kevin here,</v>

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.550
please name one single object in this image.

3
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.310
Just one. This looks like a typewriter. Uh,

4
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.570
this is a blue blue balloon, some kind of chunky cream cheese.

5
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.090
And, uh, I don't even want to guess what that is. Yeah. This is impossible.

6
00:00:20.091 --> 00:00:24.710
You can't accurately identify even one element of this photo.

7
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.320
A similar image went viral last year,

8
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.120
but don't feel bad that your brain can't make any sense of this image.

9
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.510
Neither can artificial intelligence, at least not yet.

10
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.130
Google cloud vision API says that this photo of Jake and I contains hats,

11
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.260
glasses, people, food.

12
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.210
The best it can do on this photo is packaged goods.

13
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.440
The image does,

14
00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:53.330
however I promise contain real objects that are distorted by AI and

15
00:00:53.331 --> 00:00:55.700
I'll reveal what they are a little later.

16
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.770
Our brains love identifying classifying and making sense of

17
00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:02.330
meaningful inputs.

18
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.890
And without the ability to focus on meaningful information,

19
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.860
you're just confused.

20
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.290
I've been working with LG who sponsored this video on exactly what all this

21
00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:19.130
means for technology in our everyday life.

22
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.720
We've never really been able to filter and prioritize audio visual

23
00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:28.070
information until pretty recently. And until very recently,

24
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:30.620
it definitely hasn't been easy or affordable.

25
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.080
They sent me the new LG velvet.

26
00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:37.940
So I can go over a real example of how tech has to be human focused

27
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.710
and work with our brains and explore how premium

28
00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:47.450
technology is packed within devices accessible to more and

29
00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:48.560
more people.

30
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.610
The democratization of technology is amazing,

31
00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:56.480
but when you hear about pixel binning and audio Boca,

32
00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.490
it's hard to get a sense of why it matters actually matters

33
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.860
to you. So here's a question, how are we exactly?

34
00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:09.710
Does this phone take your picture?

35
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.120
Light reflects off a subject and into a lens which focuses it.

36
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.020
Then it's passed through a mosaic, filter an image sensor,

37
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.340
then through a digital converter where it's processed into what goes into the

38
00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:24.260
memory. So, yeah,

39
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.180
it's a lot like what an eyeball does as it sends an image to your brain,

40
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.620
the larger that sensor,

41
00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:34.880
the more information it's capturing and that's hard to achieve when a phone's

42
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:38.330
lens is tiny, a premium smartphone,

43
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:42.980
like the LG velvet uses pixel binning technology to overcome this hurdle.

44
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.660
Pixel binning sees data from four pixels and uses an algorithm to

45
00:02:47.661 --> 00:02:51.440
combine them into a single more precise pixel.

46
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.940
Sometimes color information is pretty clear, but in low light shots,

47
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.580
you either need an exceptional sensor or a way to interpolate the visual

48
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:04.630
information, a quad Bayer filter. That's 50% green,

49
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.160
25% red and 25% blue creates an image in

50
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.080
RGB the same way your eye does so paired with the pixel binning algorithm.

51
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.790
You're able to take limited visual information and get a clearer brighter

52
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:19.624
photo.

53
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.830
The velvet further enhances camera performance with multi-image fusion,

54
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.900
which uses LGS proprietary algorithm to combine several images at

55
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:33.610
once. As it identifies and eliminates the unwanted noise in each one,

56
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.430
the images are then fused clearly,

57
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.390
which also highlights the most dynamic visual values.

58
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.740
And it just plain interprets visual data more clearly than we can.

59
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.390
The clearer, the picture,

60
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:50.920
the fewer cognitive biases creep in for our brains to see

61
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.030
what isn't there. The bokeh effect works similarly.

62
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.770
It's from the Japanese bulk,

63
00:03:56.771 --> 00:04:01.480
meaning blur and it's that tasteful blur that minimizes what we don't want to

64
00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:05.110
focus on and highlights what we really need to look at.

65
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.100
<v 1>Do something for me. Hold your hand.</v>

66
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.920
<v 0>And out about 15 centimeters from your face,</v>

67
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.460
then focus your eyes right on your Palm.

68
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.210
Everything in the background is blurred.

69
00:04:18.211 --> 00:04:22.800
Now it's about playing with the depth of field and distance from the lens,

70
00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:27.660
whether it's your eyes or your camera Boca happens when a large

71
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.640
aperture lens opens up and you can see the bulkhead effects develop as the

72
00:04:32.641 --> 00:04:34.110
aperture gets broader.

73
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.030
Smartphones just do not have large sophisticated lenses with

74
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.980
easily varying apertures,

75
00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:45.930
but a dual lens camera allows for one lens to focus on the image

76
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.090
and another to capture information like distance with information from both

77
00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:55.800
the LG velvet can apply a Gaussian blur algorithm to the portion of the image

78
00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.300
that should be out of focus. Vocab works great,

79
00:05:00.301 --> 00:05:03.510
but it's actually really important,

80
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.490
too much information or irrelevant information is a cognitive

81
00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:12.240
distraction from what we need to focus on.

82
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.180
When our eyes are distracted,

83
00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:17.970
they tend to focus on what's closest to us.

84
00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.920
No matter if it's what we should be paying attention to in 1960 J

85
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.320
Mandelbaum showed that the eyes of pilots and drivers fixated on the dirty parts

86
00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:32.910
of a windshield instead of the full view of everything in front of them,

87
00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:35.100
it's not an iron malfunction.

88
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.050
<v 1>Oh, okay.</v>

89
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.830
<v 0>It's just your brain focusing on the wrong thing.</v>

90
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.170
Like if my glasses are dirty,

91
00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:50.550
I have to clean them immediately or it drives me insane.

92
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.760
That's me fighting the Mandelbaum effect,

93
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.530
Bo cat prioritizes, what we want to on.

94
00:05:57.531 --> 00:06:01.880
So our brain doesn't have to fight itself to sort out

95
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.600
information. Audio Boca has the same effect,

96
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:10.340
but the technology is different rather than softening less

97
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:11.750
important pictures.

98
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.340
Audio vocab eliminates unwanted sound so you can hear

99
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:20.290
what you need to hear. Check it out. I'm outside right now,

100
00:06:20.291 --> 00:06:23.140
where cars and construction and nature,

101
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.430
or all noise competing with my voice to get to your ears.

102
00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.010
This is recorded in basic mode.

103
00:06:30.011 --> 00:06:34.750
So you can hear what basic mode sounds like. This is voice bulkhead.

104
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.630
Now you're really just hearing my voice,

105
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:42.220
the meaningful thing that you want to hear when you're on the

106
00:06:42.221 --> 00:06:45.700
phone, without that we're subject to what cognitive scientists,

107
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.680
Collin cherry called the cocktail party problem where the superior temporal

108
00:06:50.681 --> 00:06:55.630
gyrus has to engage, to prioritize auditory information,

109
00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:59.530
which makes it possible to hear a single conversation.

110
00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:01.300
I didn't noisy cocktail party.

111
00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.490
The velvet does this for you by breaking down sound frequencies

112
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.870
and using a series of algorithms to identify the subjects

113
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.380
voice. Then it's separated from all the other sounds,

114
00:07:14.381 --> 00:07:17.380
being captured by using [inaudible] analysis.

115
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:22.480
The spectrum of tones that make up sound is mapped and processed to make a

116
00:07:22.481 --> 00:07:27.400
sort of fingerprint of static noise than the lesser tones are

117
00:07:27.401 --> 00:07:31.720
turns down your ears. Can't filter any of that,

118
00:07:31.721 --> 00:07:33.940
especially not in real time.

119
00:07:33.941 --> 00:07:38.110
You've got to deal with all the noise at once and use your mental energy to

120
00:07:38.111 --> 00:07:42.780
focus on the parts you want to hear with audio bulk.

121
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:48.310
Cathy tech handles that for you and frees up your gray matter.

122
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.690
Now let's free up the confusion over the photo. From the beginning of the video,

123
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.220
I created this image with a tool that uses AI and machine learning to combine

124
00:07:57.221 --> 00:07:58.300
and edit images.

125
00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:03.220
Everything came from an original set of real images and it tracks the

126
00:08:03.221 --> 00:08:07.930
movement of these images throughout the evolution of distortions and stores them

127
00:08:07.931 --> 00:08:12.790
as genes. The genes for my image were a shopping basket, cauliflower,

128
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.140
necklace, school, bus, stethoscope, toy, shop syringe,

129
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.470
upright manhole cover, and grand piano.

130
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.430
The result of all that is a frustrating to look at mine,

131
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.110
bending pile of noise.

132
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.040
It's an exaggerated example of the noise problems.

133
00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:34.870
Tech is tackling with amazing speed, precision and efficiency,

134
00:08:34.871 --> 00:08:39.280
and it's increasingly available to more and more of us

135
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.180
every day. So yeah, when a new phone comes out,

136
00:08:43.181 --> 00:08:47.920
it's easy to get wrapped up in how many megapixels the camera is and how much

137
00:08:47.921 --> 00:08:49.420
storage it has,

138
00:08:49.421 --> 00:08:54.250
but technology isn't actually about any of

139
00:08:54.251 --> 00:08:55.084
that.

140
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:59.610
It's about whether the thing in our pocket interfaces with our

141
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:04.650
actual human existence in a way that does something

142
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:09.090
better than we can or takes pressure off our

143
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:10.343
bodies.

144
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:16.080
Technology was a word that was barely used in English until the second

145
00:09:16.081 --> 00:09:18.480
industrial revolution. It just,

146
00:09:18.481 --> 00:09:22.050
wasn't what we use to talk about innovations.

147
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.790
And throughout the 20th century technology increasingly described

148
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:31.590
machines that extended our capabilities and allowed us to do

149
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.300
more work. That's still true,

150
00:09:36.301 --> 00:09:38.580
but it's more than that.

151
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.430
Now in his 1904 book,

152
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:46.320
the theory of business enterprise economists and sociologists Thorstein

153
00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:51.300
Veblen theorized that social institutions determined how

154
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.260
technology was used in 2020,

155
00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:00.270
the institution is you.

156
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.370
And as always, thanks for watching. I don't know. I did that.

157
00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:19.730
<v 2>[Inaudible].</v>
