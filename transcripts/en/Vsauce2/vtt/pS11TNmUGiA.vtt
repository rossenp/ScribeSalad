00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.870
<v 0>The sauce,</v>

2
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.760
Kevin here with the ultimate representation of good and evil and Epic

3
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:10.650
battle of morality that has raged on game boards across the globe for over

4
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:15.620
2000 years, snakes and ladders,

5
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.230
wait, snakes and ladders, nothing but a really simple kid's game,

6
00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:24.590
right wrong. While the rules are simple,

7
00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:29.480
the math psychology and hidden spiritual lessons are surprisingly

8
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.070
complex. So to highlight that unique combination in a visual way,

9
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.170
I commissioned an intricate version of the game that harnesses electricity to

10
00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:41.750
demonstrate the unpredictable gameplay,

11
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.910
the circuit that's made as we play will not only show the path to victory,

12
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.110
but will also.

13
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.100
<v 1>Veal the meaning of life. Sort of this video.</v>

14
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.660
<v 0>I was sponsored by LG chem and this custom game board was created by</v>

15
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.270
engineering, YouTube wizard, Alan pan.

16
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.130
The winner of this game of snakes and ladders will trigger this mystery

17
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.330
box to do something. I, I seriously,

18
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.340
100% do not know what's inside this box or what will happen

19
00:01:13.341 --> 00:01:16.100
when the first player reaches the final score.

20
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.580
But we're about to find out together.

21
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.410
I do know that it's powered by 16 AA batteries.

22
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.070
Alan put it together in an afternoon and he promised me,

23
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.810
he promised that it will not burn down my house.

24
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.380
So that's good. Here's how it works.

25
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.200
Alan 3d printed red and yellow game pieces that contain about

26
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.640
50 feet of stainless steel conductive thread.

27
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.590
He's put a nail juncture at every snake's head and tail

28
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.770
on every ladders, top and bottom.

29
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.010
And at the end of each row on the board,

30
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.320
I'll start by hooking up both game pieces to this bolt and tightening

31
00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:08.120
this nut down on it. I'll be red and you will be yellow.

32
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.530
And as we play, I'll wrap the steel thread around these junctures,

33
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.120
which we'll weave a path up ladders and downs snakes to show a

34
00:02:17.121 --> 00:02:20.540
trail of each player's movement on the game board.

35
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.000
<v 1>Here's the important part. When the winning.</v>

36
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.170
<v 0>Players piece touches a node on the final square,</v>

37
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.970
that will complete a circuit to the battery powered mystery box and

38
00:02:31.971 --> 00:02:34.250
whatever this thing does.

39
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.680
<v 1>Will do. Hey.</v>

40
00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.110
<v 0>Are we bothering with 16 alkaline batteries instead of using just a couple</v>

41
00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:47.870
of those powerful lithium ion cells,

42
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.100
because those lithium ion cells that kind of look like alkaline batteries

43
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.660
are not safe. When it comes to lithium ion cells,

44
00:02:56.661 --> 00:03:01.330
they should be assembled into an battery pack with protective

45
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.840
circuitry, battery manufacturers like LG chem regard,

46
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:07.900
consumer safety as their number one priority.

47
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:12.100
And that's why they do not sell air sells to consumers.

48
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.520
<v 2>Wait, what? Our bear cells.</v>

49
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.710
<v 0>Bear sales refer to individual lithium ion cells that are not incorporated into</v>

50
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:24.370
battery packs with protective circuitry, lithium ion cells,

51
00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:28.870
not embedded in a device with safety mechanisms made by credible manufacturers

52
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:33.820
are currently being used as a replaceable and rechargeable power source

53
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.770
in devices like flashlights, portable fans, vapes, and chargers.

54
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.330
If the cells insulating wrapper gets damaged while inserting and

55
00:03:43.331 --> 00:03:45.370
removing these bare cells,

56
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.080
the negative can is exposed and metal objects like keys and

57
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.820
coins make a dangerous connection between the negative can and the positive cap.

58
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.110
This can cause a short circuit leading to a sudden release of high temperature,

59
00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:03.580
gas, and flammable materials, which is called thermal runaway,

60
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.590
which is bad. No one wants that. So don't buy it. Don't sell it,

61
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.030
stay safe. Now let's climb some letters and slide down some snakes

62
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.150
or shoots. You probably know this game as chutes and ladders.

63
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.240
Since that's the name Milton Bradley gave it in 1943,

64
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.420
when it was important to the U S and sold for 50 cents,

65
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.560
I guess they thought snakes were scary and weird, which they are,

66
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.600
but to the game actually goes back much, much further than your grandpa, Joe.

67
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.610
It actually originated in India in about the second century BC and was

68
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:43.840
meant to teach children the importance of karma and comma

69
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.180
existences push and pull between one's destiny and the actions

70
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:52.120
that disrupt the path to that destiny.

71
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.090
The game play is obviously very simple.

72
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.850
The two players started at square one,

73
00:04:57.851 --> 00:05:02.530
which may actually be where we get the phrase starting at square one,

74
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.680
and then roll a die for the player.

75
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:09.730
Then moves that number of spaces. If you land at the bottom of a ladder,

76
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:12.340
then you get to climb the ladder to that space.

77
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.170
If you land at the head of a snake,

78
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.800
then you have to slide backwards down to the snake's tail.

79
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.660
And if there's nothing on the space,

80
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:24.130
then it's the other players turn the first player to get to the final one.

81
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:26.770
Hundredth space wins. That's it.

82
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.320
That's the game in the official rules.

83
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:33.130
You need an exact role to reach the 100th space.

84
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.660
So like if you're two spaces away, you need to roll a two to win,

85
00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:40.960
but I can get pretty tedious. Most people just call it a win.

86
00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:45.310
When you roll at least high enough to get to the final space and I'll do the

87
00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:50.170
same boards historically labeled ladders that advance your piece

88
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.850
with good virtuous actions like generosity or learning

89
00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.080
adversely snakes were depicted along with vices, such as greed or gluttony,

90
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.540
navigate the snakes and ladders successfully.

91
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:07.220
And the winner escapes Samsara life's cycle of death and

92
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:11.750
rebirth to reach milkshake or salvation who knew what game

93
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:16.010
literally recommended for three-year-olds. Was this profound,

94
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.840
just looking at this board,

95
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:22.100
I can see that snakes are a lot worse than the ladders are

96
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.150
beneficial,

97
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.920
but how much worse we can figure out the breakdown of this boards.

98
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.680
10 ladders and 11 snakes from four to 16 is a plus

99
00:06:32.681 --> 00:06:33.370
12,

100
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.870
12 to 33 is a plus 2149 to 51 plus

101
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.820
to add much of a help there.

102
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.560
And 88 to 92 is a plus four. All right, snakes,

103
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.030
21 to three, let's say minus 1852,

104
00:06:49.031 --> 00:06:53.680
11 minus 39 93 to

105
00:06:53.681 --> 00:06:56.560
25 minus 68.

106
00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.630
It's like falling down a well and 99 to 58 minus 41.

107
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.420
All right. So the advantage of ladders,

108
00:07:04.421 --> 00:07:08.980
we're looking at one 18 divided by 10 equals

109
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.790
plus 11.8 per ladder. And for snakes,

110
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.740
we're looking at three 88 divided by 11 equals

111
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.450
minus 35.27 per snake.

112
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:27.550
It's almost exactly three times worse to land on a snake than it is beneficial

113
00:07:27.551 --> 00:07:28.900
to land on a ladder.

114
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.730
And there's an additional snake in there just to make it tougher because why

115
00:07:33.731 --> 00:07:38.350
not? And this whole thing is probably just random. No, it's not an interview.

116
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:43.210
Roll message of this game is that it's harder to follow a

117
00:07:43.211 --> 00:07:47.980
path of good than it is to follow a path of

118
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:53.320
bed. It's just easier to slide down into bad choices and bad

119
00:07:53.321 --> 00:07:58.060
habits than it is to lift yourself up with virtuous deeds.

120
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.080
And as subtle as the games hidden moral lessons may be,

121
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.320
get a load of the unseen mathematical operation.

122
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:10.300
This absolutely ancient board game is actually a 101 state

123
00:08:10.301 --> 00:08:11.980
absorbing Markov chain,

124
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:16.840
a series of events that depends on the state of the prior event,

125
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:21.700
which we first explored in per Rondo's paradox that could theoretically go

126
00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:26.320
on forever, especially when you've got so many punishing snakes.

127
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.610
And if you want to make absolutely sure the next time you're playing this with

128
00:08:30.611 --> 00:08:34.660
your five-year-old sister, Sally, that it doesn't last to nine hours. Well,

129
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.400
you can't. I mean,

130
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:40.840
it's not likely that a game will last the rest of your lives,

131
00:08:40.841 --> 00:08:44.380
but with just the right combination of roles and snakes,

132
00:08:44.381 --> 00:08:48.100
it actually could because snakes and ladders,

133
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.990
isn't a game of skill.

134
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.710
There's nothing you can do to speed up a win.

135
00:08:53.711 --> 00:08:57.540
And there's no mistake that you can make to lose.

136
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.650
All you can do is roll and see what happens. Okay.

137
00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:03.960
This is taking a while. What if I really,

138
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.560
really want to know when this game will end?

139
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:12.600
I can use board States and random roles to run a Monte Carlo

140
00:09:12.601 --> 00:09:17.430
simulation that gives us the most common length of our snakes and ladders game

141
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.980
and the odds of any given length

142
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:27.000
Four, four, four. Yes, we are close. One,

143
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:28.110
two, three,

144
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:37.310
You one, two, three, four. All right. Look.

145
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:41.780
Uh, until this moment I have left this battery out for a reason.

146
00:09:41.781 --> 00:09:45.380
I was worried that I don't know I would have messed something up and then this

147
00:09:45.381 --> 00:09:47.090
thing would have done something.

148
00:09:47.091 --> 00:09:51.290
And then I wouldn't have been able to put whatever happens back in here.

149
00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:54.770
So the fact is we're at 98 and it's my turn.

150
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:59.150
And as long as I don't roll a one, it is the actual moment of truth.

151
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.710
I've reached the end of the board.

152
00:10:00.711 --> 00:10:05.570
I've successfully ascended ladders and overcome the pitfalls of

153
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.540
evil snakes. So I'm going to put this battery in. Now.

154
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.910
It is fully charged,

155
00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:22.400
as they say it is lit. Okay,

156
00:10:22.401 --> 00:10:27.050
I'm going to move everything so that you get the best possible look at

157
00:10:27.051 --> 00:10:29.180
whatever is about to happen. Next

158
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.570
don't roll the one. Don't roll a one. Don't roll a one. Don't roll.

159
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.093
<v 3>One.</v>

160
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.730
<v 0>Okay. For, Oh, right. Oh,</v>

161
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:50.240
I'm so nervous about this. Here we go.

162
00:10:59.120 --> 00:10:59.953
<v 4>[Inaudible].</v>

163
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.020
<v 0>It was, Oh my gosh. It was actual snakes. Well,</v>

164
00:11:12.021 --> 00:11:15.140
not actual steaks, but spring floated sakes,

165
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:22.880
the gearing up of it was actually almost as scary as the exploding

166
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:24.350
snakes themselves.

167
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:34.190
Snakes and ladders is a remarkable combination of mathematics and human

168
00:11:34.191 --> 00:11:35.001
psychology.

169
00:11:35.001 --> 00:11:39.770
That was invented centuries before the stochastic techniques needed to analyze

170
00:11:39.771 --> 00:11:43.790
it were known, let alone two board game designers think about it.

171
00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:48.440
A game intended for children needs to average just the right length,

172
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.890
too short. And it's not interesting enough too long,

173
00:11:51.891 --> 00:11:56.500
and it gets boring snakes and ladders nailed this so

174
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.410
perfectly that thousands of years later,

175
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.120
kids are still growing up playing the game. And that isn't an accident.

176
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.950
Billions of people across 100 generations have played

177
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.660
snakes and ladders without even considering the deep story of

178
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.280
numbers, morality,

179
00:12:15.281 --> 00:12:20.200
and the essence of human existence buried below it's

180
00:12:20.201 --> 00:12:24.850
childish facade in describing the Hindu board game,

181
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:30.250
Lila, which is a 72 space version of snakes and ladders Haris

182
00:12:30.251 --> 00:12:34.210
Johari said there is really only one game.

183
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:39.100
The game in which each of us is a player acting out

184
00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:43.330
his role. And while, sometimes in life,

185
00:12:43.331 --> 00:12:46.210
we land on ladders that launch us ahead.

186
00:12:46.211 --> 00:12:50.890
And other times we step on snakes that slide us back.

187
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:55.210
You got to just pick up the dye and give it another role

188
00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:59.950
because the game goes on until eventually you reach your goal,

189
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.820
whether that's reaching Nirvana or

190
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:10.420
triggering a mystery box of springy snakes,

191
00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:14.560
and as always, thanks for watching.

192
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:23.910
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>

193
00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:24.301
<v 0>Hey,</v>

194
00:13:24.301 --> 00:13:29.130
I recently went to Philadelphia and shot a really cool video with LG chem

195
00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.370
to explain the dangers of handling bare cells.

196
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:37.410
Lithium ion cells can release way, way more energy than alkaline batteries,

197
00:13:37.411 --> 00:13:42.120
which makes them amazing when they're properly and safely enclosed in a

198
00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:46.980
protective battery pack, but seriously, risky to handle when air.

199
00:13:46.981 --> 00:13:51.660
So to see me walk you through how unsafe it is to use bare

200
00:13:51.661 --> 00:13:53.820
cells and to just learn more,

201
00:13:53.821 --> 00:13:57.090
check out the great video that I made with LG chem,

202
00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.360
click the link down in the description below to do that.

203
00:14:00.361 --> 00:14:02.130
You are going to really enjoy it.

204
00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.230
You can figure out what to do with these pesky steaks.

205
00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.800
Any device that requires a user to handle bare cells is

206
00:14:13.801 --> 00:14:14.634
dangerous.

207
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:19.680
If the cells insulating wrapper is damaged while inserting and removing the bare

208
00:14:19.681 --> 00:14:21.150
cells from the device,

209
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:26.580
the negative can becomes exposed and metal objects like a key

210
00:14:26.581 --> 00:14:31.080
or a coin can make a dangerous connection between the negative can and the

211
00:14:31.081 --> 00:14:32.010
positive cap,

212
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:36.840
a connection like this could cause a short circuit leading to a sudden release

213
00:14:36.841 --> 00:14:40.080
of high temperature, gas, and flammable materials,

214
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.540
which is called thermal runaway.

215
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:46.590
<v 3>And the result.</v>
