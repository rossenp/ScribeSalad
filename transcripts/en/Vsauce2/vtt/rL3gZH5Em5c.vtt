<v 0>A portion of this video is sponsored by last pass. The sauce, Kevin here,</v>

2
00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:08.640
and I'm being mugged by a baby. Why? Please? No, no,

3
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:13.230
I'm not giving you my wallet. Bloviating give me your wallet.

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.240
This is a mugging though.

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.820
It's not a buggy trying to make a math video and you are

6
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.480
baby child doll thing. You're not mugging me. Oh yes I am.

7
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.230
How much scratches in the wallet? If you are Jack, my name is Kevin,

8
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.120
not Jack and not a lot of money. Like 10 bucks. They'll go away.

9
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.420
Here's the deal. If I take your wallet today,

10
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.930
I'll find you tomorrow and give you $20.

11
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.160
That's a 100% return on being bugged by me.

12
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.580
Come on. There's there's no way that you'll possibly make good on that deal.

13
00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:53.750
I can't trust you.

14
00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:57.950
You you're just some creepy feeling baby doll,

15
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.930
your game, huh? 10 times then 10 times.

16
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.150
I'll give you a $100 tomorrow for stealing 10 bucks today.

17
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.550
Kind. No, no, no, no.

18
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.080
This is ridiculous. Where are you going to get a hundred dollars tomorrow? Ah,

19
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.340
no, I'm not giving you my wallet. I'm keeping 10 bucks, a thousand dollars.

20
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.530
What? $10,000 tomorrow. Five, 10 bucks right now, buddy,

21
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.190
by actually this is starting to get interesting.

22
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.220
Give me a second to think about this over here.

23
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.850
I need to start considering the odds of this actually happening.

24
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.500
What are the odds of a child jumping me on the street and then making good on

25
00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:47.300
their promise to give me more money tomorrow. This is the only way I can decide.

26
00:01:47.301 --> 00:01:51.800
I can compare the probability of it happening relative to the payoff. I'll get.

27
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.820
If it does, if the odds were 50% and I had $10,

28
00:01:55.821 --> 00:02:00.260
I'd break even playing this game over time. If babies mugged me every day,

29
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.580
if the payoff is a hundred dollars, then I'd break. Even at 10% odds.

30
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.180
If the payoff is $10,000 and there's a better than a

31
00:02:08.181 --> 00:02:10.490
0.1% chance,

32
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.350
which is one in 1000 that the baby delivers the 10,000 bucks to me

33
00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:18.200
tomorrow. And it only costs me $10 today.

34
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.790
Then it's actually a smart move in terms of, of expected value.

35
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.160
$1 billion, Kevin,

36
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.800
1 billion by you give you $1 billion tomorrow for

37
00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:34.700
stealing $10 in your wallet today, do the math,

38
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.740
do the math, right? All right, I'll do the math. All right.

39
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.870
So is there a one in 100 million chance that this scenario is

40
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.090
real? That's my break even point.

41
00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:51.980
So if the odds are saying one in 50 million, this is a great deal.

42
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.210
Theoretically, if I'm wrong and it's one in 125 million,

43
00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.700
then I've made a really bad decision here. I mean, think about it.

44
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:05.440
What are the odds that a super bored billionaire is sitting around with a few

45
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:07.210
other really bored billionaires.

46
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.920
And they're watching me as they play some kind of creepy social

47
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:16.810
experiment. They could give the baby doll the money tomorrow.

48
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.160
That sounds crazy and highly unlikely,

49
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.150
but is it possible? Yeah,

50
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.480
it's possible at a certain point.

51
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:33.250
The odds that this scenario is legit, make giving up my wallet,

52
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.650
worth it relative to the payoff.

53
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.510
It's just a wallet and I lose 10 bucks and I get a

54
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:45.370
mathematically plausible possibility of getting enough money to change tens

55
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:47.680
of thousands of lives, maybe more,

56
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.720
what would you do with $10 billion or a hundred billion

57
00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:53.554
dollars?

58
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.020
I'd fill a swimming pool with peanut butter and then figure out the rest

59
00:03:59.021 --> 00:03:59.854
from there.

60
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.050
The rewards here are very real on the expected value calculations.

61
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.990
Add up. So why would I not do this?

62
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:10.870
That's the rational decision.

63
00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:15.640
It's like a lottery that's mathematically in my favor.

64
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.743
Here's a question.

65
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.130
Can I even figure out the real odds in a situation like this?

66
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.840
I'm not just flipping a coin.

67
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:27.790
I'm wondering what a weird inanimate doll thing is

68
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.930
going to do tomorrow. A hardcore mathematician,

69
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.670
fully committed to expected value would happily take this baby

70
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.550
muggers deal, but you're smarter than that. You know this isn't a good idea.

71
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:45.040
If you give this baby your wallet,

72
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.160
you're never seen either one ever again.

73
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.790
Baby needs to steal 10 bucks today,

74
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:56.320
but it's going to pay you a billion tomorrow. It makes no sense.

75
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.650
The baby knows the expected value calculation too,

76
00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:04.210
and understands that it's perfectly rational for me to give up my wallet.

77
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:09.130
So why wouldn't she use that information to her advantage and pose a

78
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:10.360
scenario? She can see.

79
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.310
<v 1>Exceed with 100% of the time. Again,</v>

80
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.410
you're smarter than the math here, but can artificial.

81
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.180
<v 0>Intelligence realize.</v>

82
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.350
<v 1>What you know, or would it just play the numbers?</v>

83
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.670
<v 0>Wait, what if it's not some weird lottery style payoff?</v>

84
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.850
What if the scenario is not a good thing at all?

85
00:05:32.851 --> 00:05:35.760
And instead is something terrifying.

86
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.130
What if the baby says they've got a biological weapon that will

87
00:05:41.131 --> 00:05:45.600
harm millions and they'll unleash it unless you give them

88
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.580
your $10 does giving up your wallet as a

89
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.170
preventative measure,

90
00:05:52.171 --> 00:05:56.670
make more sense than the scenario in which you were going to win a bunch of

91
00:05:56.671 --> 00:06:01.550
money should be extremely low probability of something really

92
00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:04.190
just converge to being zero.

93
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.930
At what point do we just consider such a small value meaningless?

94
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:13.670
And what if a very low probability event is offered

95
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:15.530
to a thousand people,

96
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.250
does it make sense for us to pass on it as individuals,

97
00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:23.630
but to accept it, if we all do it together in a group,

98
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.850
that's really the impact of Pascal's mugging based on Pascal's wager

99
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:33.680
the centuries old philosophical argument about the existence of

100
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.603
God,

101
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.230
a scenario developed by Eliezer you'd Koski and further explored by Nick Bostrom

102
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.550
has tested the limits of belief in utilitarianism,

103
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.680
expected value. And decision-making in pretty weird scenarios.

104
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.370
If you want to dive further into the origins of Pascal's mugging,

105
00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:57.080
you can read their explanations for free online and you should,

106
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.820
but all of this might matter to some not weird

107
00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:04.190
scenarios like recycling,

108
00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:07.790
a single soda can probably isn't going to save the environment,

109
00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:11.870
but we have good reasons for thinking it'll lead to an important payoff.

110
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.830
Despite being irrational on the surface.

111
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.330
At a certain point,

112
00:07:17.331 --> 00:07:22.040
we really can't comprehend how big something is or how good it

113
00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:24.800
is or how dangerous it is.

114
00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:29.510
So how can we possibly program artificial intelligence

115
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.760
to make the decisions that are actually in our best interest and

116
00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:38.480
not just based on the best raw calculation.

117
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.820
So is this deal actually a good deal for

118
00:07:43.821 --> 00:07:44.480
me?

119
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.890
Do I let the baby take my wallet for the possibility of tremendous

120
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.340
gain or to avoid a horrible disaster?

121
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.540
Even though I know it's obviously absurd.

122
00:07:56.690 --> 00:08:00.620
So you gotta to give me a wine or not Jack now. No,

123
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.260
no, I I'm not. I,

124
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:08.660
I personally would rather do a little bit of good with my 10 bucks,

125
00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:13.160
for sure. Then risk it for a near impossible monumental payoff.

126
00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:17.930
But some of you watching this video would likely have a different answer and

127
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:22.910
that's okay. We both have perfectly valid conclusions.

128
00:08:22.911 --> 00:08:27.560
And one of the many crucial things to consider as we advance

129
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:32.090
artificial intelligence is understanding those critically

130
00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:36.920
important nuances of human intelligence

131
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.860
and saddle shoe wearing grifter doll

132
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:46.370
intelligences too, I guess.
