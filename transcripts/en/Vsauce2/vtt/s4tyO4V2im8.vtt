00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.670
<v 0>Vsauce Kevin here with a homemade deck of 52 mean cards</v>

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.600
to show you a game that should be perfectly fair,

3
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:14.160
but actually allows you to win most of the time. How,

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.200
because there's a hidden trick and a simple algorithm that if you know,

5
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:21.630
it makes you the overwhelming favorite,

6
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:25.950
even though it appears that both players have a perfectly equal 50,

7
00:00:25.951 --> 00:00:29.730
50 chance to win well, that's not very fair.

8
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.710
What is fair?

9
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.700
We can consider a coin to be fair because it's binary.

10
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:40.670
It has just two out comes when you flip it heads or tails.

11
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.000
And each of those outcomes are equally probable,

12
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.290
although it could land on its edge

13
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.880
in 1993,

14
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.500
Daniel Murray and Scott teal posited that an American nickel, which has a flat,

15
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.240
smooth outside Ridge could theoretically land on its edge

16
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.530
about one in every 6,000 tosses. But for the most part,

17
00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:10.100
since the first Electrum coins were tossed in the kingdom of Lydia in seventh

18
00:01:10.101 --> 00:01:10.551
century,

19
00:01:10.551 --> 00:01:15.410
BC goings have been pretty fair as are playing cards like

20
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.970
this deck of handcrafted meme cards. When you pull a card,

21
00:01:19.971 --> 00:01:23.330
you either get a red or a black card,

22
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.530
Ryan Carson, it's perfectly binary,

23
00:01:27.531 --> 00:01:31.340
and there's no way for a car to like land on its edge.

24
00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:33.590
It's either red or it's black.

25
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:38.120
It's 50% like a snap from FENOs

26
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.140
given that.

27
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.060
Is it possible to crack the theoretical coin flipping code and take

28
00:01:44.061 --> 00:01:48.710
advantage of a secret non transitive property within this

29
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.420
game? Yes. Welcome to the humble Nissiyama randomness game.

30
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.770
Walter penny debuted a simple coin flipping game in the October,

31
00:01:57.771 --> 00:02:02.720
1969, issue of the journal of recreational mathematics and then Steve humble.

32
00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:07.550
And you talk on Nissiyama made it even simpler by using playing cards.

33
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.391
Here's how it works.

34
00:02:08.391 --> 00:02:12.860
The first player chooses a sequence of three possible outcomes from our deck of

35
00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:14.780
cards like red, black, red,

36
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.190
and then the second player chooses their own sequence of three outcomes like

37
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.420
black, black, red. And then we just flip our red and black meme cards.

38
00:02:23.421 --> 00:02:27.910
And the winner is the one whose sequence comes up first. So in this example,

39
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.570
thanks to guy Fieri player one would have won this game because player one

40
00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:34.760
chose red, black, red.

41
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.330
Here's a little bit of a nitpick because we're not replacing the red and black

42
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.830
cards after each draw.

43
00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:47.810
The probability won't be exactly 50 50 on every draw because

44
00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:49.850
each time we've removed one colored card,

45
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.330
the odds of the opposite color coming next is slightly higher,

46
00:02:53.331 --> 00:02:57.680
but it'll never be far from perfectly fair. And as we play it,

47
00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.710
we'll continue to out.

48
00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:04.480
So given that each turn of the card has a roughly equal chance of

49
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:06.130
being red or black.

50
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:10.660
And given that the likelihood of each sequence of three is

51
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:11.500
identical.

52
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:15.640
The probability that both players have an equal chance of winning what their red

53
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.050
and black sequences has to be 50 50 to

54
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.120
right wrong.

55
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.070
And to demonstrate why I've invited my best friend in the whole wide world.

56
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:29.830
Where are you? Best friend. Kiano Reed.

57
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.820
<v 1>Okay. All right. Okay. I know you're a little tall. Hold on.</v>

58
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.343
What's this?

59
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.470
<v 0>Okay. Kiana will be player one.</v>

60
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.660
There are only eight possible sequences that Kiano can choose. Red, red,

61
00:03:51.661 --> 00:03:56.460
red, red, red, black, red, black, red, red, black, black, black, red, red,

62
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.480
black, red, black, black, black, red, or black, black, black,

63
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.450
no matter what Kiano chooses.

64
00:04:03.451 --> 00:04:08.430
The probability of that sequence hitting is equal to all the other options for

65
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.090
player one. There really is no bad choice.

66
00:04:12.091 --> 00:04:14.940
One choice is as good as the next.

67
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.920
So let's say that Kiano chooses black, red, black, great choice there.

68
00:04:19.921 --> 00:04:24.870
Kiano. Now that I know your sequence, I'm going to choose black,

69
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.630
black, red. Okay.

70
00:04:27.631 --> 00:04:31.620
Now we'll just draw some cards and see which sequence appears.

71
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.590
First red Tommy was so

72
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.040
some red flex seal action so far, nobody has an advantage.

73
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.480
Black, where are your fingers?

74
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.580
Oh, sad. Sad.

75
00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:54.900
Kiano you should be sad once you realize that.

76
00:04:54.901 --> 00:04:59.850
Now there's no way that I can lose because of having these

77
00:04:59.851 --> 00:05:04.650
two black cards in a row. Even if I pull five more black cards in a row,

78
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.240
eventually I will get a red and I will win.

79
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.920
Or my GERD,

80
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.550
ah, there it is. Minecraft.

81
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.020
Steve has sealed the victory for me. Sorry,

82
00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:26.970
my most excellent dude, but I win because regardless of what player,

83
00:05:26.971 --> 00:05:27.900
one chooses,

84
00:05:27.901 --> 00:05:32.610
what matters is the sequence that player two picks as player two.

85
00:05:32.611 --> 00:05:35.460
The method here is very easy.

86
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.840
I just put the opposite of the middle color at the front of the line.

87
00:05:39.841 --> 00:05:42.240
So when Kiano picked BRB,

88
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.510
I just changed his middle arm to a B,

89
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.540
and then put that at the front of my sequence.

90
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.340
So I just dropped the last letter and my sequence becomes B B R

91
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.880
I'll show you another example. If Kiana had chosen red, red,

92
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.740
then I would have just changed that middle R to a B,

93
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.450
put that at the beginning of my sequence dropped the last R and my sequence

94
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:07.850
would be B R R.

95
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.060
Just that little trick allows me to have an advantage anywhere from about two

96
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:17.330
to one, up to 7.5 to one,

97
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.570
which means in the worst possible scenario for me,

98
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.150
I win two out of three times.

99
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.170
And in the best it's nearly eight out of nine. Look,

100
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:31.670
I'll write out all the choice options and their odds as player two.

101
00:06:31.671 --> 00:06:33.350
When we apply the algorithm,

102
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.760
we're jumping into exactly the right place in a cycle of outcomes.

103
00:06:37.761 --> 00:06:42.530
That player one doesn't have any control over the best player one can

104
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:45.980
do is choose an option. That's the least bad.

105
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.450
How is this possible? How can I take something?

106
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:54.080
So seemingly fair to both players. So obviously.

107
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.480
<v 1>50 50 And.</v>

108
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.430
<v 0>Turn it so strongly in my favor. The key is in recognizing that.</v>

109
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.990
<v 1>This game is non transitive.</v>

110
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.850
So there you go. The end, wait.

111
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.630
<v 0>What is transitive? Think of it this way. You've got a,</v>

112
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.310
B and C a B to B and B, B, C, therefore,

113
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.300
a beats C, because if a beats B and BBC,

114
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.890
then obviously a can beat C that game is transitive.

115
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.820
So if you and your Kiano whoops had transitive food preferences,

116
00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:33.400
you'd rather have pizza than tacos,

117
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.310
and you'd rather have tacos then dog food.

118
00:07:36.311 --> 00:07:40.480
You'd also rather have pizza than dog food. Simple.

119
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.790
If you, in your Keanu,

120
00:07:42.791 --> 00:07:46.270
somehow preferred dog food to pizza,

121
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:51.040
then all of a sudden your food preferences become non

122
00:07:51.041 --> 00:07:54.430
transitive in a non transitive game.

123
00:07:54.431 --> 00:07:58.900
There is no best choice for the first player because there's no super

124
00:07:58.901 --> 00:08:03.580
powered a instead there's a loop of winning choices like

125
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.450
rock paper scissors in rock paper, scissors, rock,

126
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.300
which we'll call a loses to paper,

127
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.840
which we'll call B B is better than a,

128
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.820
but a beats scissors,

129
00:08:15.821 --> 00:08:19.270
which is C so a is better than C,

130
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.760
but B loses to C.

131
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.480
So C is better than B and paper B beats rock a.

132
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.970
So B is better than a scissors.

133
00:08:27.971 --> 00:08:31.900
C loses to rock a and beats paper B.

134
00:08:31.901 --> 00:08:36.820
And we've got a loop of possible outcomes that goes on

135
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:41.620
forever with no one choice being stronger than the other.

136
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:46.600
That's non transitive. Since we're in the flow chart mood,

137
00:08:46.601 --> 00:08:50.740
here's a flow chart that illustrates the player to winning moves in the humble

138
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.950
Nissiyama randomness game. So if you follow the arrows,

139
00:08:53.951 --> 00:08:58.560
you can see that our beats BBB and like BBR

140
00:08:58.561 --> 00:09:02.160
beats BRB, and so forth with the odds added,

141
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:06.750
you can clearly see how some sequence scenarios go from bed to

142
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:07.584
worse

143
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:13.290
in the humble Nissiyama randomness variation of pennies game.

144
00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:17.850
We know what sequence of card colors player one has chosen first.

145
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:22.770
So we can jump in the most advantageous part of the non transitive loop

146
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:27.240
and make a choice that gives us a significant advantage.

147
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.840
By recognizing that the game is non transitive,

148
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:35.370
we can take seemingly obvious fairness and find a paradoxical

149
00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:40.170
loophole that nearly guarantees us success to everyone who doesn't

150
00:09:40.171 --> 00:09:42.150
recognize the intransitivity.

151
00:09:42.151 --> 00:09:45.300
It just kind of looks like we're extremely lucky.

152
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.820
And why does all of this matter?

153
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:52.800
Because bacteria play rock paper scissors to multiply Benjamin Kirkup

154
00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:57.540
and Margaret Riley found that bacteria compete with one another in a non

155
00:09:57.541 --> 00:10:00.840
transitive way. They found that in mice intestines,

156
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.340
E coli bacteria formed a competitive cycle in which three

157
00:10:05.341 --> 00:10:08.400
strains basically played a game of rock paper,

158
00:10:08.401 --> 00:10:13.350
scissors to survive and find an equilibrium pennies game and

159
00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:17.340
its variations illustrate how even a scenario that seems

160
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.410
perfectly straightforward,

161
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.150
like unmistakably simple should never be taken at

162
00:10:24.151 --> 00:10:27.300
face value. There's always room to develop,

163
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.060
strategize and improve our odds.

164
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:32.820
If we put in the effort and imagination.

165
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:37.970
<v 1>Wired to understanding the situation and that</v>

166
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.650
truly is

167
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.470
breathtaking and as.

168
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.180
<v 0>Always, thanks for watching.</v>
