00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.860
<v 0>The sauce, Kevin here, and I haven't had food or drink in days.</v>

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.520
I'm so hungry and so thirsty.

3
00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:12.960
And I've got these bagel bites and this bottle of mountain Dew.

4
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.440
If I'm equally hungry and thirsty,

5
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:21.000
do I eat or drink? Eat, or drink,

6
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.600
eat or drink, eat or drink, eat or drink, eat or drink, eat or drink.

7
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.713
Don't drink, eat or drink.

8
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.560
And if I sit here paralyzed by indecision long enough,

9
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.060
I will die of starvation and dehydration

10
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.590
technically dehydration first. Anyway, that's not good.

11
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.690
This classic decision theory paradox was created in the 14th century

12
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.010
by John brewery,

13
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.990
Don involving a famished donkey who dies from indecision.

14
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.760
And this whole thing is completely irrelevant, absurd,

15
00:00:56.761 --> 00:01:01.560
and has no bearing on our modern sophisticated 21st

16
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.480
century lives, right wrong.

17
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.320
We're faced with one of the most important choices of our time.

18
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.820
Everything hinges on what we decide your future

19
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.620
is at stake. And in this period of dissension, friction,

20
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.020
strife, and everything that's going on,

21
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:23.100
we need to band together and elect a president

22
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.770
of YouTube. After months of debates and campaigning,

23
00:01:28.771 --> 00:01:33.600
the people have spoken to candidates have emerged the McCobb

24
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.280
internet archeologist Wang and the feculent animation goblin

25
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.600
psychic pebbles.

26
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.580
It is a time for choosing let's meet our candidates.

27
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.960
<v 1>As your YouTube president.</v>

28
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.940
I promise to restore this website to its former glory days.

29
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.760
It's days of offensive root Tesco,

30
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.760
brand unfriendly wild West chaos,

31
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.600
malicious insults based on intrinsic attributes.

32
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.080
That's what his website was built on. Copyright copyright. Come on,

33
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.560
making fun of this hilarious,

34
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.320
both for freedom and join the Wang gang.

35
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.210
<v 0>Uh, thank you, Wang. Uh, let's hear from pebbles.</v>

36
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.450
<v 1>As you're a YouTube president.</v>

37
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.310
I pledge that every utuber with over 1 billion subscribers must compete and

38
00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:33.020
annual no holds barred, Duggar,

39
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.040
dove style battery out where the winner keeps their channel and all the others

40
00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:41.240
are deleted. So I asked you for a vote for fairness,

41
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.900
and to join the cult of pebbles. Uh, you know,

42
00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:46.880
we have a great selection of imported cheeses,

43
00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:49.370
and that's just one of the perks I'm not even going to go on, but yeah,

44
00:02:49.371 --> 00:02:51.320
there's a lot. That's just one fighting.

45
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.090
<v 0>To the death. Sounds bad,</v>

46
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.510
but I do like cheese.

47
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.490
I don't know who to pick you though, you know, right away,

48
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:03.220
whether you're in the lawless Wang gang,

49
00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:06.460
or you want to be lured in by the cult of pebbles.

50
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.900
They're so different from each other that the choice is

51
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.980
obvious or you definitely know which one you don't want,

52
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.280
which is good for the candidates. No, no,

53
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:21.130
it's surprisingly not.

54
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.690
I've got gas. So I'm going to open up a gas station.

55
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.760
Jake's pumping dump gas station already exists near the middle of

56
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:33.580
town. It's right next to taco bell, obviously.

57
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:38.140
So I'll open up mine further away. We're selling gas.

58
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:40.270
As long as the prices are similar,

59
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:43.420
people are just going to fill up where it's closest.

60
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.920
Jake can have all of these customers and I'll have all these

61
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.320
no problem right wrong.

62
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.700
If the two are far apart and we do pretty much the same thing,

63
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:55.534
which we do,

64
00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.310
we'll be splitting the customers in this distance between us.

65
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.970
So the smaller that distance, the fewer customers,

66
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.190
I lose to the pump and dump.

67
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.380
I get everything on my side of town and I don't lose

68
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:14.650
anything between our two gas stations. And Hey,

69
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:17.680
if I run some amazing gas station, sushi promotion,

70
00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:22.390
maybe I can even pull some customers from barely into

71
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.230
Jake's side of town. The further I am away,

72
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:30.910
the more people I have to convince to choose my

73
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:33.670
gas station and not his,

74
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.970
this is why McDonald's can have basically the same menu with their own spin.

75
00:04:38.971 --> 00:04:43.020
And even their logos are both primarily yellow and red.

76
00:04:43.021 --> 00:04:47.970
And why fast food places in general are all typically located near

77
00:04:47.971 --> 00:04:48.804
each other.

78
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.850
It's called hoteling is law outlined in the 1929 stability in

79
00:04:53.851 --> 00:04:56.370
competition by economists Harold hotel,

80
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.470
stating that it's rational for two competitors to be as similar as possible

81
00:05:01.471 --> 00:05:05.640
to each other while retaining their own distinct identity.

82
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.550
Cool time for Wang as your YouTube,

83
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.110
I will bring back the five star rating system. Well,

84
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.740
as your YouTube president, the IQ will bring back the star rating system,

85
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.660
but there will be six stars, not five on this issue.

86
00:05:21.661 --> 00:05:25.920
The two candidates are pretty close. There's a difference,

87
00:05:25.921 --> 00:05:28.140
but it's not much hoteling.

88
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.150
Law happens with voting it's in a candidates interest to be pretty similar

89
00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:37.530
to their opponent, to minimize that loss in the middle. Hey,

90
00:05:37.531 --> 00:05:42.270
do you want an Apple or an orange pick one? That's not very hard.

91
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.990
You probably like one fruit more than the other.

92
00:05:45.991 --> 00:05:48.330
So it's a simple choice,

93
00:05:48.331 --> 00:05:52.500
but do you want this Apple or that Apple?

94
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.230
How do you even make that decision?

95
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.150
You base it on the size of the Apple,

96
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.210
the shape of the Apple it's

97
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.480
STEM that's Redskins paradox.

98
00:06:07.481 --> 00:06:12.130
The closer two choices are the harder it is to

99
00:06:12.131 --> 00:06:16.750
choose. So at this point, I really start to analyze, I dig deep.

100
00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:21.490
I stress out over little differences and can even see some that

101
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.060
aren't really there because to make a meaningful choice,

102
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.030
I need there to be a difference.

103
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.980
And now you're thinking I never was like a sheen Northcote Parkinson problem.

104
00:06:32.981 --> 00:06:35.950
And your right in 1957,

105
00:06:35.951 --> 00:06:40.030
seen Northcote Parkinson proposed that the more you analyze something,

106
00:06:40.031 --> 00:06:44.860
the more obsessed you become with the less relevant details and

107
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.870
forget the really big stuff he wrote that the time spent on any

108
00:06:49.871 --> 00:06:54.550
item of an agenda will be in inverse proportion to the sum of money

109
00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:55.743
involved.

110
00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.970
Where should I go to college is a question I put some thought into

111
00:07:00.971 --> 00:07:03.970
and it costs tens of thousands of dollars.

112
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.950
What video games should I get is a question I obsess

113
00:07:08.951 --> 00:07:13.180
over and that'll cost 60 bucks at most.

114
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.060
I'm trapped in the tyranny of small decisions.

115
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.010
What economist Alfred econ called that hyper focus on the tiny details that

116
00:07:21.011 --> 00:07:25.600
actually gets you further from the overall outcome you wanted in the first

117
00:07:25.601 --> 00:07:25.901
place.

118
00:07:25.901 --> 00:07:30.850
And then Sayers law knocks on my forehead and says in any dispute,

119
00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:35.830
the intensity of feeling is inversely proportional to the value of the issues

120
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:36.963
at stake.

121
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.470
Like a couple who's constantly fighting over whether the toilet paper feeds from

122
00:07:41.471 --> 00:07:46.330
the front or the back and never discusses the mounting credit card debt

123
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.600
from buying old PS, one strategy guides off.

124
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:54.040
<v 2>EBay, just beat a legend of drag goon, recent lanes.</v>

125
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.990
It who's awesome. So.

126
00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:01.240
<v 0>How's that a president of YouTube choice coming along now that I'm here in the</v>

127
00:08:01.241 --> 00:08:03.850
weeds, I don't know who to choose.

128
00:08:03.851 --> 00:08:06.640
I'm emotionally invested in figuring it out.

129
00:08:06.641 --> 00:08:11.560
I go deep on less important details and I'm kind of starting to lose

130
00:08:11.561 --> 00:08:15.880
my mind. So, all right. All right. Whoa, wait, how about this baby?

131
00:08:15.881 --> 00:08:19.420
This election is not even about me.

132
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.430
Maybe I want to do what's best for the world around

133
00:08:24.431 --> 00:08:28.090
me. Think of a board family in Texas it's Saturday. Hey,

134
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.740
no one's doing anything.

135
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.690
The dad suggests they all take a trip up to Abilene an hour away because he

136
00:08:34.691 --> 00:08:37.390
thinks the family will enjoy it.

137
00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.140
He knows the drive sucks and he'll sweat the whole time.

138
00:08:41.141 --> 00:08:45.670
So he's not too excited, but his family they'll love it.

139
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.920
He asks his wife and she's happy to go because she thinks

140
00:08:50.921 --> 00:08:55.680
the group wants it too. She asks their son and he, yes,

141
00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:57.990
because he doesn't want to disappoint his parents.

142
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.230
Their daughter doesn't want to be the only protest vote.

143
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:04.200
And at this point she would lose three to one anyway.

144
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:07.320
So she enthusiastically says yes too.

145
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:12.360
And that's how a family of four unanimously voted to take a

146
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.760
long, hot trip in a car full of sweat.

147
00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:18.660
And dad's farts that none of them actually wanted to take.

148
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:23.400
That's Jerry B Harvey's Abilene paradox and voting for what?

149
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.530
No one really wants,

150
00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:28.620
happens a lot in selfless democracies.

151
00:09:28.621 --> 00:09:30.630
But here's my question.

152
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.050
Is that just a function of having only two choices,

153
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.130
Wang or pebbles stay home or go to Abilene.

154
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.970
It's got to get easier when you have more choices, right wrong.

155
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:47.130
Arrow's impossibility theorem shows us that when voters have three or more

156
00:09:47.131 --> 00:09:48.270
different options,

157
00:09:48.271 --> 00:09:52.680
there's just no way to get exactly the right community wide outcome.

158
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.350
Even if we rank candidate preferences,

159
00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:00.240
we've got Wang and pebbles and we could throw in smarter every day and Lindsay

160
00:10:00.241 --> 00:10:01.860
Ellis and Marquez Brown Lee,

161
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:06.480
and so young and preferentially ranked them all one through six and we

162
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:10.680
still would not get the YouTube government we all wanted.

163
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.440
So why should I even bother?

164
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:18.210
And how much do you or I count anyway,

165
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.270
in 1793, French philosopher,

166
00:10:21.271 --> 00:10:25.800
Marquis de Condorcet wrote that in single stage elections where there are a

167
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:30.420
great many voters. Each voters influence is very small.

168
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:35.160
It is therefore possible that the citizens will not be sufficiently

169
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:39.480
interested to vote. Look at my plate of sand.

170
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:44.310
One single vote is really the inverse of the Greek sororities

171
00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:49.110
paradox, where you remove grains of sand one by one from him.

172
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:53.840
<v 3>Here we go. We're moving brains one at a time.</v>

173
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.450
Rain too. Here we go. Rain.

174
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.160
<v 0>All right. You know what? This is going to take forever.</v>

175
00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:03.110
Look at what point does it stop being a

176
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:07.970
heat? At what point does your infinitesimal vote add up

177
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.560
to actually mattering paradox, lightning round.

178
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.340
If a rational voter relies on their self-interest to make their choice,

179
00:11:16.341 --> 00:11:20.480
the costs of that boat are usually greater than the benefits. Anthony Downs,

180
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:21.860
paradox of voting.

181
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:26.600
Adding a new state can reduce the number of congressional representatives in

182
00:11:26.601 --> 00:11:31.100
another state or portion in paradox or a state with a fast growing

183
00:11:31.101 --> 00:11:36.020
population can lose representatives to a slow growing state population.

184
00:11:36.021 --> 00:11:39.260
Paradox want to reduce the use of fossil fuels.

185
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:43.910
Green policies can incentivize a short-term rise in consumption.

186
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.433
Han's Verner, sins.

187
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.240
<v 3>Green paradox.</v>

188
00:11:47.241 --> 00:11:50.990
It's so hard to make sense.

189
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.310
<v 0>Of all of this when add up all the logic,</v>

190
00:11:54.311 --> 00:11:58.870
traps and complexities of something that seems so simple,

191
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.790
drink or eat Apple a or Apple B hypothetically,

192
00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:07.480
make my family happy or tell the truth that I don't want to go to Abilene.

193
00:12:07.481 --> 00:12:11.620
And neither do they. The more I think about it,

194
00:12:11.621 --> 00:12:14.620
the less I'm sure.

195
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:19.060
I know every time we make a choice like Wang, VI,

196
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.610
pebbles, or vote for a real precedent,

197
00:12:21.611 --> 00:12:26.320
we're subject to all of these hidden consequences of decision theory

198
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.190
and mine are different from yours.

199
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.300
You've got to think about all the options, all the scenarios,

200
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.480
all of the contradictions and all the fallacies,

201
00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:42.340
but ultimately it's more important that you

202
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:46.870
don't get stuck in a cognitive web of indecision,

203
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.520
psyching yourself out from making a choice at all,

204
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:56.230
or you'll end up staring at bagel bites and mountain Dew

205
00:12:56.231 --> 00:13:00.160
until you're a dead gamer donkey.

206
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.080
Now go to Twitter and vote for your next YouTube president,

207
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:10.090
chaos or cheese choose wisely. And as always, thanks for watching,

208
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.560
I was going to eat it, but it's freezing cold. So I am going to eat.

209
00:13:13.561 --> 00:13:14.394
I'm just going to heat up.

210
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:23.280
[inaudible] ah,

211
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:26.490
greetings cook over here to get the new subscription for thinkers.
