00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.010
<v 0>The sauce, Kevin here. And I'm about to stretch my Winky on till it snaps.</v>

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.170
Actually, I've got three of these anti-stress emoji people called

3
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.060
winkies only one will survive and you will witness an

4
00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:19.380
incredibly simple problem that almost everyone gets wrong.

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.250
And at the end,

6
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.350
get to the bottom of one of the most famous probability problems ever.

7
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.270
It's time to meet the winkies orange purple and

8
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.210
blue. They've been sentenced to death,

9
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:35.490
but just one will be pardoned.

10
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.520
The other two are walking the green mile,

11
00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:42.180
but they don't know which two it will be.

12
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.680
All they know is that I warden Kevin get to decide

13
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.450
right now each winkies chance of survival is one out of three.

14
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.400
So one over three plus one over three plus one over three equals one.

15
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.510
With every Winky, having an equal shot at living.

16
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.080
There's no paradox here yet.

17
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.150
The fairest least biased way to choose which Winky lives is to put three

18
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:13.950
slips of paper into a hat and randomly draw a color and a mix around your

19
00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:16.560
slips. And here we go.

20
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.060
But what if they know that I drew a color

21
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:27.150
yet? I don't tell them which one it is.

22
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.480
These winkies would be left to wonder who will live,

23
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.070
who will die and what their own personal odds of survival

24
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.300
really are.

25
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.650
<v 1>Kevin, Kevin, given,</v>

26
00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:44.540
you can tell me I can keep a secret. Tell me who will live.

27
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.570
<v 0>I think he is talking to me and I think I recognize that voice</v>

28
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.950
keeper of internet history. How'd you end up on death row.

29
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.510
Anyway. I can't tell you who survives. It's it's just not fair.

30
00:01:59.511 --> 00:02:03.350
And I definitely can't tell you whether you live or die.

31
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.950
<v 1>I understand you bear a heavy burden.</v>

32
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.720
Just tell me one of the winkies that will be executed.

33
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.270
If purple lives. Tell me blue. If blue lips tell me,

34
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.870
and if I'm going to the live, just choose.

35
00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:25.250
Which of the other two you'd like to name, do this for me, Kevin Queens.

36
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.380
<v 0>Uh, I don't, I don't know orange Winkie. It really doesn't seem fair.</v>

37
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.340
<v 1>Air, please. Given pretty place USR handsome,</v>

38
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.380
and those glasses look so good on you.

39
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.460
<v 0>Oh, okay. What's the harm.</v>

40
00:02:40.461 --> 00:02:44.540
I can't possibly give orange Winky any useful information.

41
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.910
<v 1>Blue will be executed right now</v>

42
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.220
to, I didn't.

43
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.060
<v 0>Mean to put his body back that way upside down, but you know what?</v>

44
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.990
Warden Kevin is, uh, is a cruel warden.

45
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.120
<v 2>Kevin, you fool. Now I never, my odds are 50 50.</v>

46
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.600
I will live or purple will live.

47
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.580
There is no alternative use. Stupid stupid man.

48
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.570
Oh, he's so dumb and also fat. Oh no.

49
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.960
<v 0>He's right. I got tricked by a Winkie.</v>

50
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.630
Now there are only two choices. One will live and one will not.

51
00:03:33.631 --> 00:03:38.250
So his odds improved from one out of three to 50

52
00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:41.760
50, right? Wrong orange Winkie.

53
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.540
You still only have a one out of three chance to live.

54
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.700
And purple Winky is actually twice as likely to win the pardon.

55
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.200
This may remind you of the Monty hall problem and we'll get to why that's

56
00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:56.340
important later.

57
00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.050
But for now let's break down the only possible scenarios that orange Winkie

58
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.040
faced.

59
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.960
Remember that I can't tell orange Winkie whether he lives or

60
00:04:06.961 --> 00:04:08.730
dies. When I named blue,

61
00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:13.710
we can compare the two possible outcomes after naming blue

62
00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:18.570
scenario one where I named blue and purple lives as a one out of

63
00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:22.350
three probability of occurring scenario three,

64
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.120
where I named blue and orange libs has a one out of

65
00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:32.100
six chance of happening since one over three is twice

66
00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:34.560
as large as one over six.

67
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.480
And since they're the only two possible outcomes after naming

68
00:04:39.481 --> 00:04:43.260
blue, meaning their probabilities have to add up to one.

69
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.440
Purple actually has a two out of three chance of survival.

70
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.700
And orange only has a one out of three chance of avoiding execution.

71
00:04:50.701 --> 00:04:55.530
The probabilities of two events that appear to be equally

72
00:04:55.531 --> 00:04:59.880
likely just aren't. And we can't handle that,

73
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.710
or it's time to reveal which Wiki will live and which Winkie will die.

74
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.240
This slip of paper determines our survivor and

75
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.260
purple lives. Sorry.

76
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.401
<v 3>Kevin Gleason,</v>

77
00:05:14.401 --> 00:05:19.080
for you to know have calm history by buddy is strategic

78
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.323
[inaudible].

79
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.930
<v 2>Yeah, cause I called that you fat.</v>

80
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.203
I am dead.

81
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.720
<v 0>Welcome to the three prisoners problem,</v>

82
00:05:30.721 --> 00:05:35.430
which is actually the Bertrand's box paradox and kind of the Monty

83
00:05:35.431 --> 00:05:39.480
hall problem, but mostly the Bertrand's box paradox,

84
00:05:39.481 --> 00:05:40.740
which came out the same year.

85
00:05:40.741 --> 00:05:45.690
The Eiffel tower opened van Gogh painted the story night and Nintendo copay

86
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.150
first started producing playing cards.

87
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.650
They eventually made video games in 1889,

88
00:05:52.651 --> 00:05:55.650
70 years before recreational math columnist,

89
00:05:55.651 --> 00:06:00.650
Martin Gardner started playing mind games with prisoners on their execution

90
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:02.450
date, French mathematician,

91
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.580
Joseph Bertrand published how cool day probability in

92
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:11.300
which he posed a paradox that became the basis.

93
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.580
The Genesis for Monte hall and will require

94
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:18.680
me to stick my winkies.

95
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.200
<v 2>In pudding. Let me explain. After.</v>

96
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.100
<v 0>Making me a plate of 10 DS and my favorite dipping sauce,</v>

97
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.080
my mom's secretly hid winkies in these three large candy

98
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:31.880
dishes full of pudding.

99
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.390
One of them contains two winkies of the same color.

100
00:06:35.391 --> 00:06:39.050
Another one contains two winkies of a different color.

101
00:06:39.051 --> 00:06:43.880
And then one contains one Winkie. Each of those two colors.

102
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.960
I'm pretty sure that mom said one Winky color is yellow,

103
00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:51.410
but I'm not sure what the other one is.

104
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.570
<v 2>It's just so much grosser than I thought it was going to be.</v>

105
00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.770
<v 0>Let's reveal this winkies color.</v>

106
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.870
Thank you for looking me clean, Kevin, your tongue.

107
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.060
<v 2>Is so smooth. How are you alive?</v>

108
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.240
<v 0>You can kill me. Kevin we're friends now. Okay,</v>

109
00:07:10.241 --> 00:07:15.010
well clearly we have an orange Winkie somehow back from the dead and we

110
00:07:15.011 --> 00:07:18.070
know that the second Winky color is yellow,

111
00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:22.990
but what are the chances that the other Winkie in this pudding is

112
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.910
also orange.

113
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.770
We know that the three dishes are orange, orange, orange, yellow,

114
00:07:29.771 --> 00:07:31.780
and yellow, yellow.

115
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.910
Each combination is equally likely to be chosen at the star.

116
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.380
We also know that this can't be the yellow, yellow dish,

117
00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:45.610
because I just pulled out the creepiest orange Winkie

118
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.930
on the planet. That means it's coming from orange, orange,

119
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.150
or from orange and yellow,

120
00:07:52.151 --> 00:07:55.480
and both had the same chance of being selected.

121
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.260
Once we pull the orange Winky, we know that the odds,

122
00:07:59.261 --> 00:08:03.880
the other Winkie in this dish is orange is 50 50,

123
00:08:03.881 --> 00:08:07.510
because I've clearly chosen either the orange,

124
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.350
orange pudding or the orange yellow pudding, right.

125
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:16.660
<v 2>Wrong again for the same mathematical reason as our prisoner</v>

126
00:08:16.661 --> 00:08:18.010
problem. This.

127
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:22.180
<v 0>Is the mathematical foundation of all these</v>

128
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:23.290
scenarios.

129
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.270
Our inability to recognize that what appears to be 50

130
00:08:28.271 --> 00:08:32.680
50 really isn't hold on before I explain further,

131
00:08:32.681 --> 00:08:36.070
let's just find out real quick where the winkies are,

132
00:08:36.071 --> 00:08:40.270
because I actually don't know. Well, this was orange, orange.

133
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.520
It was orange, orange jar. Number two. I can't even tell that.

134
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.090
Okay, that's yellow. Now is this one orange? Or is this the yellow,

135
00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:53.470
yellow jar time to find out it looks orange. It looks orange. Let's see. Yup.

136
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.700
There's the other orange. So that was our yellow orange,

137
00:08:56.701 --> 00:08:58.530
which means that this has to be.

138
00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.390
<v 4>Yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow.</v>

139
00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:07.220
<v 0>I have to clean up this pudding or else we can't continue the video.</v>

140
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:08.600
So I'll be right back.

141
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.050
All right, now that the Vsauce muck bang portion of our video is complete.

142
00:09:21.051 --> 00:09:23.630
Let's get to the root of this problem.

143
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:28.730
Bertrand conceived his original paradox with gold and silver coins

144
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:33.590
and boxes. He had the same basic setup. We used gold, gold, gold,

145
00:09:33.591 --> 00:09:38.510
silver and silver, silver with the player, reaching into a random box,

146
00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:43.640
drawing a gold coin and wondering about the odds of that box containing

147
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.380
another gold coin.

148
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:49.340
Once we pull on a gold coin or an orange Winky,

149
00:09:49.341 --> 00:09:51.590
or one of the prisoners to be executed,

150
00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:56.420
it feels like our odds of whatever comes next are an equal

151
00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.010
50 50.

152
00:09:58.011 --> 00:10:02.900
We're just choosing between two leftover options that appear to

153
00:10:02.901 --> 00:10:04.070
be equally likely.

154
00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:08.810
We know the other coin is either gold or silver, but look,

155
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.710
if you pull a gold coin, either poem gold coin,

156
00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.440
one gold coin two or three.

157
00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:19.970
And at this point you conceptually know that you're not dealing with the box

158
00:10:19.971 --> 00:10:23.450
with the two silver coins. You don't know exactly what it is,

159
00:10:23.451 --> 00:10:27.320
but you do know what it's not. If you choose gold one,

160
00:10:27.321 --> 00:10:30.980
the other coin is gold two. If you choose gold two,

161
00:10:30.981 --> 00:10:34.670
the other coin is gold one. If you choose gold three,

162
00:10:34.671 --> 00:10:39.110
you'll get silver one. So two out of three times you draw gold.

163
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.490
It'll be paired with another gold. And only one time out of three,

164
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.470
will you get stuck with silver,

165
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.150
but it's almost impossible to shake the notion of two

166
00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:51.920
equivalent options.

167
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.640
Even when the math shows us that it's wrong.

168
00:10:55.641 --> 00:11:00.440
It's the same reason why the Monty hall problem is a problem.

169
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.940
The prisoner problem,

170
00:11:01.941 --> 00:11:06.710
and Monty hall add a story to the math and an additional third party.

171
00:11:06.711 --> 00:11:09.620
It seems like that would make it more complex,

172
00:11:09.621 --> 00:11:13.820
but it actually helps you understand the probability more easily.

173
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.610
Adding a second player's perspective,

174
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:21.530
lets us see that the warding will never reveal who lives in Monty hall will

175
00:11:21.531 --> 00:11:24.020
never reveal the door with the money.

176
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:28.730
Despite that additional information, we still get it wrong.

177
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:34.160
Why is it so hard when the solution is right in front of our

178
00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:38.240
face? Probably because it is right in front of our face.

179
00:11:38.241 --> 00:11:39.650
And it's why very,

180
00:11:39.651 --> 00:11:43.880
very smart people often get it more wrong than right.

181
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.760
I mentioned this in my, what is a paradox video,

182
00:11:46.761 --> 00:11:49.850
but when Marilyn Vos savant wrote in parade magazine,

183
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:54.880
that switching doors in the Monte hall problem resulted in a two over three

184
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:56.110
chance of success.

185
00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:01.300
Instead of being an obvious 50 50 trade parade received over

186
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:04.990
10,000 letters telling her she was wrong,

187
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.010
about 1000 of them were signed by PhDs.

188
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:13.600
And she claims many were sent on official letterheads from college math

189
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.220
and science departments.

190
00:12:15.221 --> 00:12:20.050
And I still get comments on my video from people all over the

191
00:12:20.051 --> 00:12:24.250
world telling me that I'm wrong. Massimo,

192
00:12:24.251 --> 00:12:25.630
Pia tele Paul Marini,

193
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:30.400
author of inevitable illusions said that no other statistical

194
00:12:30.401 --> 00:12:35.350
puzzle comes close to fully all of the people all the time and

195
00:12:35.351 --> 00:12:39.400
research in 1995 by Grantsburg and Brown found that only

196
00:12:39.401 --> 00:12:43.900
13% of people correctly switched Monty

197
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:49.180
Hall's doors in a 2003 paper in the journal of experimental psychology,

198
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:54.580
Stefan Krauss and X T Wang described these particular problems from her trans

199
00:12:54.581 --> 00:12:58.330
box to Monty hall as cognitive illusions,

200
00:12:58.331 --> 00:13:03.040
stating that they demonstrate people's resistant deficiency in dealing with

201
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:03.970
uncertainty,

202
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:09.010
they found that only 3% in the control group solved the problem with

203
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.320
mathematically correct reasoning.

204
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:16.330
And that a significant problem was perspective when participants were

205
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.080
able to think of the problem from the perspective of Monte hall,

206
00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.970
instead of the game show contestant or thinking as

207
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:29.860
me warden, Kevin, instead of as the prisoner orange Winkie,

208
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:33.580
their chances of choosing the right pathway improved,

209
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.400
vaulting them from simple non Basie,

210
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.840
thinking into more complex Bayesean analysis.

211
00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.040
In the 1990s,

212
00:13:42.041 --> 00:13:46.690
it appeared that there was no way to break the mathematical illusion of

213
00:13:46.691 --> 00:13:47.860
Bertrand's box,

214
00:13:47.861 --> 00:13:52.840
the three prisoners or the Monty hall problem explaining

215
00:13:52.841 --> 00:13:55.240
the math just didn't seem to work.

216
00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.970
It turns out the math isn't the problem. We are.

217
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.120
Uncertainty is hard for us.

218
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.150
Changing perspectives is harder,

219
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:12.160
your watching this video because you're a smart Jarius

220
00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:16.060
person. And by altering your perspective,

221
00:14:16.061 --> 00:14:20.680
you don't just dismiss a mathematical illusion that has

222
00:14:20.681 --> 00:14:25.480
perplexed us for over a century because you have identified

223
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:30.370
it's flaw. You don't just solve it. You embrace it,

224
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.210
you absorb it, you understand it.

225
00:14:34.211 --> 00:14:38.680
And you ultimately use it to your advantage.

226
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.600
You know it, and I know that I have.

227
00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.680
