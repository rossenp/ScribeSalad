00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.310
<v 0>If you traveled to the deepest points of earth, what would you find?</v>

2
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.360
Lost cities, mythical, sea monsters,

3
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.370
rivers of gold. Probably not,

4
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:21.060
but there's still a lot to discover. So join me.

5
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.710
As we traveled deep,

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.540
underneath the surface to explore some of the most inhospitable

7
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:29.220
places on earth,

8
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.630
what lives at the bottom of the Mariana trench,

9
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.210
how much of the ocean is unmapped and

10
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.560
what is mined deep below the earth surface?

11
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.800
This is what if, and here's what would happen if you explored the deep,

12
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.320
this points on earth?

13
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.330
Not many people can claim that they've been to the deepest point on earth,

14
00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.530
but Victor [inaudible] from 2018 to

15
00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:01.850
2019,

16
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.830
the Scoville led an expedition that visited the deepest points in

17
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.360
all five oceans.

18
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.970
The five deeps expedition covered 87,000 kilometers in just

19
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.950
10 months and completed 39 dives using a small submarine

20
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.550
for your trip. You're only going to visit one trench.

21
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.860
The Mariana trench you'll need to save about three quarters of a million

22
00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:28.940
dollars for the trip,

23
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.870
but you'd be one of the few people to explore this deep.

24
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.270
What would you say I see as you descend first,

25
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.360
you'd need to travel to Japan from there.

26
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.190
You'd take a submarine about 2000 kilometers out into the Pacific

27
00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:48.980
ocean challenger. Deep.

28
00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.200
The deep point of the Mariana trench is almost 11 kilometers

29
00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:55.280
below the surface,

30
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.210
and it would take about two and a half hours to reach it.

31
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.890
There will be a lot to look at in the beginning of your descent.

32
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.840
The first 200 meters below the surface is where most ocean life

33
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:11.630
thrives. As you travel deeper,

34
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.950
it becomes darker and the less wildlife you'd see

35
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.720
though, you still get to witness the occasional whale diving for food.

36
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.940
You'd see your first deep sea creature,

37
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.780
the Fang tooth at one kilometer below the surface.

38
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.760
This appropriately named fish is 16 centimeters long with

39
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.270
two giant teeth to make room for them.

40
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.660
The Fang tooth has two sockets beside his brain.

41
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.250
As you travel deeper than 2,500 meters,

42
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.480
there are no more whales. They don't usually dive down this deep,

43
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.290
but when you hit 8,000 meters,

44
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.580
you'd encounter the Marianna snail fish. At this point,

45
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.720
the atmospheric pressure is nearly 1100 times what you feel

46
00:03:03.721 --> 00:03:07.230
at sea level. If you weren't inside a pressurized submarine,

47
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.760
it would be like having the weight of a fully loaded truck on your head.

48
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.890
Those little snail fish out there must be pretty strong to withstand all this

49
00:03:16.891 --> 00:03:21.630
intense pressure. Eventually you'd reach the very bottom.

50
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.260
The challenger deep. If you look closely,

51
00:03:25.261 --> 00:03:29.970
you might spot an amphipod species or run the Lake Gigis.

52
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.160
These small deep ocean creatures are only about three centimeters

53
00:03:35.161 --> 00:03:39.240
long, and that's about it down in the Mariana trench,

54
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.590
no secret treasures, hidden cities or sea monsters.

55
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.410
Next it's time for you to travel to the world's deepest sea volcano.

56
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.840
The West Mata volcano.

57
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.670
This underwater site is located Southwest of the Samoas.

58
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:02.070
You'll need to rent another submarine to travel down 1200 meters below the

59
00:04:02.071 --> 00:04:06.240
surface. But since you just visited the Mariana trench,

60
00:04:06.241 --> 00:04:08.010
it should be no problem for you.

61
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.010
If you're lucky the volcano would be active and you would enjoy seeing

62
00:04:14.011 --> 00:04:16.560
lava fountains and glowing bubbles,

63
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.670
just be careful of all the debris that erupts into the ocean.

64
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.670
Both the West Mata volcano and the Mariana trench are natural,

65
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.320
deep points on earth. But what about something that's manmade?

66
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.590
The Penang goldmine is the deepest operating mind in the world

67
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.400
around 4,000 miners working it every day.

68
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.460
And despite safety precautions,

69
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.570
it's still risky in March, 2020,

70
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.730
a seismic event killed three miners who were three and a half kilometers

71
00:04:53.731 --> 00:04:56.490
below the surface to get to the mine.

72
00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.330
You'd need to travel to the Gauteng province. In South Africa,

73
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.210
you'd take the elevator known as a cage with 119 other

74
00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:10.980
workers until it reaches two and a half kilometers below the earth surface.

75
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.150
As the elevator doors open, you'll notice the heat.

76
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.640
It's about 30 degrees and that's only because the mining company has

77
00:05:20.641 --> 00:05:22.950
created a system to cool down the air.

78
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.060
Without fans blowing over a mixture of ice and salt,

79
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.770
the mind would be a whopping 60 degrees. Why?

80
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.960
Because you're so deep in the earth that it's inner heat is warming up the

81
00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:38.100
surrounding atmosphere.

82
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.710
You'd only be two and a half kilometers underneath the earth surface to

83
00:05:43.711 --> 00:05:44.550
go lower.

84
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.680
You'd need to walk or drive the rest of the way you'd be at the

85
00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:53.190
bottom of the mine. When you reached four kilometers,

86
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.790
that's as deep as 10 empire state.

87
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.550
Luckily there are no cave creatures to worry about down here.

88
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.040
The only life down here other than the minors is monotypic bacteria.

89
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.480
While the opening goldmine is impressive.

90
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.950
All of the deepest points on earth are in oceans.

91
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.870
According to NASA,

92
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.910
over 80% of the oceans remain unmapped, unobserved,

93
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:24.380
and unexplored.

94
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.980
And if we want to continue to explore these areas,

95
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.810
we're going to need to take better care of our planet. For starters,

96
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.660
we could clean up our trash filled oceans.

97
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.640
Can you imagine a Mariana trench just brimming with garbage?

98
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.860
Well, that's a story for another. What if.
