00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.380
<v 0>Today's episode of what if discussed is brought to you by policy</v>

2
00:00:04.381 --> 00:00:05.214
genius?

3
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.610
<v 1>At what point will we attain to status? Well,</v>

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.720
remember now we're talking about centuries to maybe a thousand years into the

5
00:00:14.721 --> 00:00:18.320
future. This means building the first star ships.

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.640
So we're going to go far beyond the solar system and reach out to the nearby

7
00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:23.474
stars.

8
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.700
[inaudible] so, Pete, how are you doing today?

9
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.130
<v 0>I'm good. How are you doing?</v>

10
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.950
<v 2>You seem surprised that I'm asking you how you're doing.</v>

11
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.830
<v 0>Is an odd way to start, but not until you say it every week,</v>

12
00:00:48.831 --> 00:00:51.920
but it seemed like you were putting me on the spot for some reason.

13
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.010
<v 2>I mean, in this case, I was actually concerned.</v>

14
00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:59.030
I am concerned with how you're doing, but more in the context of energy,

15
00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:00.350
how are you feeling energetic? Yeah.

16
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.200
<v 0>Ah, well, I mean you here, we're sitting in August of 2020, and uh,</v>

17
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.070
just the hope is this the tail end of the pandemic? Really? I don't know.

18
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.070
I think like a lot of people who are working from home,

19
00:01:13.071 --> 00:01:16.550
not everybody's working from home, but I am a lot of people are taxed. They're,

20
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.610
uh, they're, they've expended a lot of their energy.

21
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.451
<v 2>And I mean,</v>

22
00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:23.840
I think most people would answer the question the same way most people feel they

23
00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:25.130
don't have enough energy,

24
00:01:25.131 --> 00:01:28.670
they could use more energy because at the end we're all energy,

25
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:30.830
including our planet.

26
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.400
<v 0>Okay. Now I see where you're going with this. You're talking about.</v>

27
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.230
And because of para probably the, uh, the topic of today's show,

28
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.850
everything is energy.

29
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.490
<v 2>Everything is energy. And in this case,</v>

30
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.720
how planets are sort of categorize according to the [inaudible] scale,

31
00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:49.460
which is something we'll get into later,

32
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.600
there are type one type two type three civilizations,

33
00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:58.580
and it's according to how much energy they can harness from in this case type

34
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.650
two that you can harness from the sun.

35
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.810
<v 0>We have done a few car to chef scale, like videos on, uh,</v>

36
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.250
what if, um, and I don't recall, are we a type one?

37
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.600
<v 2>Well, bad news. We're not a type one yet. We're actually type zero,</v>

38
00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:17.480
which is not something that depressed. Yeah, it feels depressing,

39
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.590
but we have nowhere to go but up. Okay. Which is another way to look at it.

40
00:02:21.591 --> 00:02:26.120
It's kind of like type two would be more like solar power on

41
00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:26.780
steroids.

42
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.390
<v 0>Okay. Solar power on steroids. So it's like the sun,</v>

43
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.720
but we're getting all of our power from the sun.

44
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.380
We're able to harness all that power from the sun and store it too.

45
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.390
<v 2>Yes. And store it, which as you can imagine,</v>

46
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.160
would allow us to do a whole bunch of things.

47
00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:44.180
Not things that I would necessarily understand nor did I really understand this

48
00:02:44.181 --> 00:02:46.280
prior to probably hours ago,

49
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.330
but that's why we have guests on the show because we want people to be able to

50
00:02:50.331 --> 00:02:54.200
come on and explain some of these complicated topics.

51
00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:58.940
Like what if earth became a type two civilization and in

52
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.790
case we're lucky enough to have somebody who's a bit of an expert on the subject

53
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:06.220
and who we've also had on the show before. Yeah, we have,

54
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:09.850
it's a professor Michio. Kaku, who's extremely.

55
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.250
<v 0>Smart and well-respected.</v>

56
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.870
<v 2>And followed by a lot of people.</v>

57
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.620
And really one of the people who are most cited and quoted when you're talking

58
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:22.600
about today's would, if, what if the earth became a type two civilization.

59
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.100
<v 0>Michio Kaku is known as a futurist,</v>

60
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.460
a great communicator and a popularizer of science.

61
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.960
He first graduated Summa laude from Harvard university in

62
00:03:36.961 --> 00:03:41.490
1968 and received his PhD from Berkeley in 1972

63
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.320
CAC who has expertise in several fields, such as hydronic physics,

64
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.360
super symmetry, super gravity, super string theory and super quantum,

65
00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:54.090
no, not super quantum physics, just quantum physics.

66
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.890
He's also quite the media Maven with multiple best-selling books to his name,

67
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.160
including his most recent, the future of humanity.

68
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.440
He also hosts two radio shows and appears regularly in television

69
00:04:07.441 --> 00:04:10.350
series, exploring space physics and the future.

70
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.150
He's currently the city college of new York's Henry [inaudible] professor of

71
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.230
theoretical physics where he's been teaching for 35 years.

72
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.820
<v 2>Professor. Kaku welcome back to what if discussed.</v>

73
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.100
<v 1>Glad to be on the show.</v>

74
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.110
<v 2>We're always glad to have you. And as Peter and I talked about off the top,</v>

75
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.610
it's, it's a complicated subject. This type one type two civilizations.

76
00:04:35.611 --> 00:04:38.970
If you don't know the Cartus Chev scale. Uh, and of course,

77
00:04:38.971 --> 00:04:41.820
I think we did our best to try to understand it and explain it,

78
00:04:41.821 --> 00:04:45.780
but this is why you're here because obviously this is something that you're

79
00:04:45.781 --> 00:04:49.860
considered, uh, one of the experts on this planet. So first of all,

80
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.150
please clarify,

81
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.020
what is the Carter chef scale and what does the type one type two type three

82
00:04:55.021 --> 00:04:55.854
civilization?

83
00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.130
<v 1>Well we've businesses are tired of talking about flying saucers and little</v>

84
00:05:02.131 --> 00:05:06.030
green men and speculating about life in space.

85
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.630
I'm a physicist. We use energy, energy

86
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.470
civilizations and outer space and type one. Civilization is planetary.

87
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.580
They consume all the energy that they be saved from the sun. For example,

88
00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:24.030
they control the weather, but type two is stellar.

89
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.960
They control all the energy out, but of the mother's son,

90
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.620
sort of like the Federation of planets and star Trek,

91
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.480
they've colonized a few of the neighboring planets. They bring stars systems,

92
00:05:36.481 --> 00:05:37.800
but not much more.

93
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.630
Then there's type three type three is galactic.

94
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.330
They roam the galactic space lanes.

95
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.920
They can harness the energy of a hundred billion stars in the galaxy,

96
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.960
sort of like a star Wars star Wars would be an example of a type

97
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.420
three galactic civilization. Now what are we do?

98
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:03.620
We play with the weather, play with volcanoes and play with earthquakes.

99
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.930
Do we play with the sun? Do we play with black holes throughout the galaxy?

100
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.500
No, we are type zero.

101
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.050
We don't even rate on this scale. We get our energy from dead plants,

102
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.700
oil and coal,

103
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.040
but we are about a hundred years away from attaining type one

104
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:29.540
status. For example, the internet, what is the internet?

105
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.730
It is the first type one telephone system to be

106
00:06:34.731 --> 00:06:36.860
unleashed in this century.

107
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.380
What language will this type one civilization speak well already

108
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:43.940
English and Mandarin.

109
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:47.660
Chinese are the two greatest languages on the internet.

110
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:53.150
And what is the European union? What is NAFTA for all these trade blogs?

111
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.010
The beginning of a primitive type one planetary economy.

112
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.560
Now, if you keep the scale up,

113
00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:05.660
at what point will we attain type two status that is

114
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.670
leave this solar system and start to explore the nearby stars? Well,

115
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.280
you just take out a slide rule or a calculator.

116
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:18.290
You can calculate that in just a few thousand years, we will be type two,

117
00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:22.550
like captain Kirk, captain Kirk lives in the 23rd century.

118
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.300
So that's about right a little early,

119
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.970
but still well on this scale,

120
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.300
that decode card is shaft formulated and the 1960s.

121
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.430
Then you hit type three in about a hundred

122
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:39.860
thousand years. Wow. And why is that?

123
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.670
Because that's the energy that you attain the Planck energy.

124
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.060
The plunk energy is the energy of space.

125
00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:50.960
Time is when space becomes unstable

126
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.290
wormholes develop black holes,

127
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.940
gateway hides per spatial, gateways through space and time.

128
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.440
That's the Planck energy.

129
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:05.420
The Planck energy is a quadrillion times more powerful than the large Hadron

130
00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:09.740
Collider outside Geneva, Switzerland. And why do I mention that?

131
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.460
Because once you attain the plunk energy wormholes,

132
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:17.300
maybe even time-travel is a possibility. Wow.

133
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:23.570
<v 0>Um, let's bring it back down to earth. And, uh, and, uh, talk about type two. I,</v>

134
00:08:23.571 --> 00:08:24.700
I was asking off the top,

135
00:08:24.701 --> 00:08:28.960
whether a type two civilization was simply like solar power on

136
00:08:28.961 --> 00:08:29.794
steroids.

137
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:34.210
Now I know you're not going to quote me in your next book as a genius insight,

138
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.530
but, uh, how close is that idea to, to, uh,

139
00:08:38.531 --> 00:08:39.850
what type two means?

140
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:45.220
<v 1>Well, type two does not mean simply getting sunlight from the sun.</v>

141
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:49.210
It means playing with the sun itself. For example,

142
00:08:49.211 --> 00:08:53.920
a Dyson sphere would envelop the entire sun with a

143
00:08:53.921 --> 00:08:58.500
sphere to 100% of the energy

144
00:08:58.501 --> 00:09:02.580
output of a star. That's a Dyson sphere.

145
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.760
And astronomers think that well, we're not sure,

146
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:10.830
but we may have the signals from some potential candidates of being a

147
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:15.420
type two civilization in outer space. There's a store called Tabby star,

148
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.620
which drops it intensity by about 25%.

149
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:24.780
Some people think that maybe a gigantic Jupiter sized planet moves in front

150
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.860
of this star or absorbing all this energy.

151
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.060
And perhaps that is a Dyson sphere in outer space,

152
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:36.930
but a type two civilization would be like star Trek.

153
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.370
And the Federation of planets they've colonized that small quadrant of the

154
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:44.220
galaxy would be a type two. Civilization.

155
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.590
<v 2>Energy is something that we, I don't know it,</v>

156
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.400
I don't mean we don't talk about energy because we talk about energy.

157
00:09:52.401 --> 00:09:57.260
But as important as energy is to our day-to-day lives and our functions be

158
00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.120
in on this planet, survival,

159
00:09:59.121 --> 00:10:02.270
but even beyond you'd think we'd have even more focus.

160
00:10:02.271 --> 00:10:05.060
I think we take it for granted. Obviously you walk into a room,

161
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:08.630
turn on a light switch, et cetera. But as you said earlier,

162
00:10:08.631 --> 00:10:12.800
we w we still are at a, a pretty primitive level of harnessing energy,

163
00:10:12.801 --> 00:10:14.930
which is again, fossil fuels.

164
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:19.970
How important is it that we let's say fast forward

165
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:25.220
our harnessing of solar power to not only get to type two

166
00:10:25.221 --> 00:10:28.820
civilization one day, but to expedite the evolution of this species?

167
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.180
<v 1>Well, let's take a look at it historically,</v>

168
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:36.560
throughout most of human history for 99% of human history,

169
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:40.580
we had about a quarter of a horsepower per person,

170
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.970
the strength of your left hand and right hand.

171
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:48.380
And that's it folks that was the energy output for most of human

172
00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:50.660
civilization, about a quarter of a horsepower.

173
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.890
There will be the investigated horses. About 10,000 years ago,

174
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:59.120
we went from a quarter of a horsepower to one horsepower.

175
00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:03.080
And that began what is called civilization cities.

176
00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:09.020
Armies empire has began to be formed. And then just 300 years ago,

177
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.410
we discovered the steam engine. And as a consequence,

178
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:17.150
we went from one horsepower to maybe 10 horsepower in a

179
00:11:17.151 --> 00:11:19.820
buggy in a Moto. Now,

180
00:11:19.821 --> 00:11:23.600
of course you have access to thousands of horsepower.

181
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:28.220
And in fact, we're going to use that energy to rocket into outer space.

182
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.080
So you see that the progress of civilization can be mapped by the

183
00:11:33.081 --> 00:11:35.090
progress in energy,

184
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.770
harnessing that we've been able to harness thousands of horsepowers for what

185
00:11:39.771 --> 00:11:40.604
astronaut,

186
00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.390
while before it was only the strength of your left hand and your right hand.

187
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.410
Now you mentioned energy sources of the future. Solar is one,

188
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.260
but there's another one. I think that is even more important.

189
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.580
And that's fusion and fusion.

190
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.920
Power is still a few decades away,

191
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.730
but fusion power is the power of the universe. Wow.

192
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.690
That's what makes the sunshine is what makes the stars twinkle.

193
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.290
And we're going to be able to, I think in a few decades,

194
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:11.560
harness that fusion power on the planet,

195
00:12:11.561 --> 00:12:15.640
or you give us unlimited amounts of energy from

196
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.410
seawater. Seawater is the basic fuel for fusion plants.

197
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:22.330
And we have one in France,

198
00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:27.010
it's called the ITE E R FusionReactor in car dash France,

199
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.180
built by the European union with the help from the United States and Russia and

200
00:12:31.181 --> 00:12:35.080
Japan. And we hope to get fusion off the ground in the coming decades.

201
00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:39.360
<v 2>Well, just so we book you in it far enough in advance,</v>

202
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.420
just like you to put in your calendar that when that happens,

203
00:12:42.421 --> 00:12:45.360
we'd like to have you back on the show cause ideally you and I would still be

204
00:12:45.361 --> 00:12:50.160
alive. Peter, we'd still be doing what if discussed? But, uh, like right now,

205
00:12:50.161 --> 00:12:52.230
I would say, let's just put a pin in that for now.

206
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.200
Let's say we jump in the time machine and go right there. The,

207
00:12:55.201 --> 00:12:58.800
what if time machine Peter started up? Yes, we haven't used it in a while.

208
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.920
So let's say all the theoreticals are behind us.

209
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:06.540
We are now at that point where we are a type two civilization,

210
00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:11.670
what are some of the kind of cool things that people would be sort of fascinated

211
00:13:11.671 --> 00:13:15.690
by that a type two civilization as earth would be able to do,

212
00:13:15.691 --> 00:13:19.440
whether it's controlling the weather, the atmosphere, uh, you know,

213
00:13:19.441 --> 00:13:21.390
blowing asteroids out of the sky, look,

214
00:13:21.391 --> 00:13:25.920
what are some of the things that we should be able to expect as a type two

215
00:13:25.921 --> 00:13:26.760
civilization?

216
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:28.111
<v 1>Well,</v>

217
00:13:28.111 --> 00:13:32.190
remember now we're talking about centuries to maybe a thousand years into the

218
00:13:32.191 --> 00:13:33.450
future. Well,

219
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:38.340
we'll have pretty much colonized the entire solar system [inaudible] and

220
00:13:38.341 --> 00:13:41.400
maybe out to the nearby stars. Uh,

221
00:13:41.401 --> 00:13:45.720
we're going to build the first star ship perhaps within a hundred, 200 years.

222
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:51.060
NASA already has the 100 star 100 years starts your program looking

223
00:13:51.061 --> 00:13:55.590
at potential propulsion systems for a star ship. Uh, for example,

224
00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:00.030
anti-matter engines, uh, fusion engines, um,

225
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:05.010
even REM jet fusion engines. These are all possible engines for star ships.

226
00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:08.460
Now we're not talking to warp drive to get work tribe.

227
00:14:08.461 --> 00:14:09.690
You'd have to be type three,

228
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:14.880
but by the time you're type a one and aspiring toward type two,

229
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.880
this means building the first star ships.

230
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:22.140
So we're going to go far beyond the solar system and reach out to the nearby

231
00:14:22.141 --> 00:14:26.880
stars. There's even a program called the breakthrough Starshot program. Uh,

232
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.320
Stephen Hawking, um,

233
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:33.360
my late colleague was a member of that program and he believed that,

234
00:14:33.361 --> 00:14:37.560
yes, we should build the first star ship, not in a few hundred years,

235
00:14:37.561 --> 00:14:41.700
but in this century, just in this century build the first star ship.

236
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:42.930
Okay.

237
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:43.530
<v 2>Well, the,</v>

238
00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:47.610
one of the great things about having you is that regardless of where we're at

239
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.060
individually or collectively, I'm always optimistic,

240
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.370
excited after I S I speak to meet Shokaku because you see the future in such a

241
00:14:55.371 --> 00:14:59.150
way that is, uh, especially in these times, uh,

242
00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.700
encouraging and exciting. And,

243
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.940
and it gives us a reason to sort of, you know,

244
00:15:04.941 --> 00:15:09.230
look forward beyond our sort of day-to-day problems and be excited about it's

245
00:15:09.231 --> 00:15:11.120
interesting, because we talked about, you know,

246
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.550
homosapiens being around for 200,000 years and professor KAK, who's saying,

247
00:15:16.551 --> 00:15:19.970
you know, all you had for power was horsepower,

248
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.590
and now we're a hundred years away. Probably yes. I mean,

249
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:27.620
a hundred years away, we couldn't fly or sorry, a hundred, you know,

250
00:15:27.621 --> 00:15:30.470
a little over a hundred years ago, we couldn't fly. So, and then, you know,

251
00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:33.800
50 years later, 60 years later, we're sending people to the moon. So as,

252
00:15:33.801 --> 00:15:35.750
as you are always adept at doing,

253
00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.810
you get us sort of steered in the right direction. We're going to have, uh,

254
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:43.010
professor Kaku on later. If you want to listen to this full in-depth interview,

255
00:15:43.011 --> 00:15:46.490
beyond our conversation, that we just had click on the link below,

256
00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:50.990
because a special treat, we are going to be breaking down,

257
00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:56.120
uh, your most recent New York times bestseller the future of humanity.

258
00:15:56.121 --> 00:16:00.680
I don't think it's overstating it to say that this is one of those times where

259
00:16:00.681 --> 00:16:03.560
you want to be thinking about the future of humanity,

260
00:16:03.561 --> 00:16:07.310
but especially the insights and the visionary, uh,

261
00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.830
perspectives that you have in the book.

262
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.460
Give us a little idea of what we're going to be hearing about, uh,

263
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.670
and what people can expect to find in the book, the future of humanity.

264
00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:23.290
<v 1>Well, you know, the, the dinosaurs did not have a space program.</v>

265
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:25.960
They're not here today.

266
00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.400
There are no dinosaurs joining us for this interview today because they got

267
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:34.780
out, they were clueless. They didn't know what hit them. Well,

268
00:16:34.781 --> 00:16:38.350
we do have a space program, and it's inevitable that we're going to have crises.

269
00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.820
For example, volcanic eruptions, media impacts pandemics.

270
00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.850
We know they're going to be crises of the future,

271
00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.460
and we need an insurance policy,

272
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.210
an insurance policy to make sure that humanity survives,

273
00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:56.200
no matter what catastrophes I hit the planet earth

274
00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:01.720
and the main stumbling block preventing that was a four letter dirty word

275
00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:02.883
costs.

276
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:08.290
It costs $10,000 to put a pound of anything into orbit around the planet earth.

277
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:13.000
That's your waiting goals. Think of your body may not have solid goals.

278
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.800
That's what it costs just to put you in orbit around the planet are well.

279
00:17:17.801 --> 00:17:22.750
Now prices are dropping because Elon Musk and others

280
00:17:22.751 --> 00:17:27.370
are perfecting the reusable rocket because of competition because of

281
00:17:27.371 --> 00:17:29.890
private public collaboration,

282
00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:34.210
the price of space travel is dropping like a rock.

283
00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:39.130
This means that in the future, mom and dad may be able to go to outer space.

284
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:41.920
And I would even predict that our grandkids,

285
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.460
we have the option of honeymooning on the moon.

286
00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:48.760
<v 2>Cool. Not the dark side of the moon though.</v>

287
00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:52.500
Cause not a good way to start a relationship. So again,

288
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:56.430
more with Dr. [inaudible], uh, about everything,

289
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.280
future of humanity, you don't want to miss this.

290
00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:03.690
So click on the link below and you're going to get a really in-depth dive into a

291
00:18:03.691 --> 00:18:07.260
rabbit hole. That's going to cover so many topics about the short,

292
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:12.180
medium and longterm future of humanity on this planet. Uh,

293
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:15.270
Dr. Kaku talked about insurance policies, Peter,

294
00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:20.430
it sounds like the perfect segue to talk about our friends at policy genius.

295
00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:25.910
<v 0>Professor CACO is not necessarily an insurance salesman, um, but is.</v>

296
00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.190
<v 2>A genius possibly not a policy, definitely.</v>

297
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:29.330
<v 0>Not a policy genius.</v>

298
00:18:29.331 --> 00:18:33.230
Well policy genius is an insurance marketplace and there comes a time in life

299
00:18:33.231 --> 00:18:37.520
when it becomes evident that people need some life insurance, but uh,

300
00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:41.240
the world being a little topsy-turvy right now certainly is pandemic.

301
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:45.320
It's a deadly pandemic and you might be thinking, okay, well,

302
00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.680
can you buy life insurance when there's a deadly pandemic?

303
00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:52.250
Cause there is it inflated. They cover me. Well, the short answer is yes,

304
00:18:52.251 --> 00:18:55.160
you can buy life insurance during a pandemic. And if you have loved ones,

305
00:18:55.161 --> 00:18:58.010
depending on your income, it's a really good idea,

306
00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:02.120
a best place to go for the best rate policy genius policy genius,

307
00:19:02.121 --> 00:19:03.710
like I say is an insurance marketplace.

308
00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:06.680
They're in contact with the life insurance companies on their platform every

309
00:19:06.681 --> 00:19:07.250
day,

310
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:10.850
keeping track keeping track of the insurance market so that you don't have to,

311
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.980
they've got the expertise to cover you quickly.

312
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:17.150
And at the best price they compare quotes from the top life insurance companies,

313
00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.750
all in one place just takes a few minutes to compare quotes from the top

314
00:19:20.751 --> 00:19:21.584
insurers.

315
00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:26.150
And that saves you a lot of legwork and it saves you a lot of money up to

316
00:19:26.151 --> 00:19:31.010
$1,500 or more per year by using policy genius to compare life insurance policy.

317
00:19:31.011 --> 00:19:33.560
So if you're looking to buy life insurance,

318
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.190
you're not sure where to start head on over to policy genius.com.

319
00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.970
That'll get you and your family protected and hopefully give you one less thing

320
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:41.833
to worry about.

321
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.581
<v 2>So yes,</v>

322
00:19:43.581 --> 00:19:48.350
I guess we have a lot to look forward to would be the glass half full because

323
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:52.940
we're type zero. As, as professor Kaku talked about,

324
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:57.800
we're hundreds of years away from probably being a type one and thousands of

325
00:19:57.801 --> 00:19:58.880
years away from being a Titan.

326
00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.730
<v 0>This is like I mentioned, is this is, uh,</v>

327
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.840
heartening for me as opposed to disheartening for me in that, like I said,

328
00:20:05.841 --> 00:20:06.740
the human

329
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:12.890
homosapiens have been here for 200,000 years and all the progress we've made is

330
00:20:12.891 --> 00:20:17.060
basically to get to here. And he thinks in a hundred years, 200 years,

331
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.030
we could be a type one civilization. My gosh,

332
00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:24.920
like how incredible is that progression in 100 years compared to the last

333
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.600
200,000 years?

334
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.210
<v 2>I'd love to see that on the news more, right? Yeah,</v>

335
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.880
because it's so easy as he talked about that,

336
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.990
we get so focused on the present and you know, if you're a Zen Buddhist,

337
00:20:35.991 --> 00:20:38.150
you'd say, well, that's where you want to be. You want to be in the moment,

338
00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.920
but we also get fixated on this particular time as though this

339
00:20:42.921 --> 00:20:45.050
is, you know, this is the,

340
00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:49.930
the future of the is basically the next 10, no it's hundreds of years,

341
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.590
thousands of years, regardless of even what happens in the short term,

342
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.850
we in the planet are going to be around a long time in some form.

343
00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.450
And it seems crazy obviously,

344
00:21:00.451 --> 00:21:05.140
as we sit here today that the energy that we use and harness is still, you know,

345
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.740
as he said, like, you know, plants and, and,

346
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:12.130
and fossil fuels when you have the King dinosaur dinosaurs, decaying, dinosaurs,

347
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.780
and the focus on the sun, isn't new, but hearing this, you think, man,

348
00:21:16.781 --> 00:21:20.140
if we really focused all our attention on solar power and then, you know,

349
00:21:20.141 --> 00:21:21.580
further harnessing that power.

350
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:26.460
<v 0>So we've got this enormous yellow burning ball of</v>

351
00:21:26.461 --> 00:21:30.030
energy that I can feel on my face. I walked down the street,

352
00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:34.770
it's burning all day long. I mean, certainly we are earth rotates,

353
00:21:34.771 --> 00:21:38.130
but why are we not expanding all our energy,

354
00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:42.300
expanding all our energy into capturing the energy from something that's free,

355
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:46.200
something that's incredibly powerful and something that's so close rather than

356
00:21:46.201 --> 00:21:47.340
like, you know,

357
00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.600
bugging around with all this junk underneath the dirt.

358
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.980
<v 2>We're the only species in the world that actually has the ability to</v>

359
00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:57.630
delay its own evolution.

360
00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.380
<v 0>Because we have, we've known this for 15.</v>

361
00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:06.180
<v 2>The 60 years that obviously there's a way to get solar power, uh, you know,</v>

362
00:22:06.181 --> 00:22:10.140
make it ubiquitous around the world and essentially make energy as close to free

363
00:22:10.141 --> 00:22:14.340
as possible. But our focus hasn't been there, our focus has been in other ways.

364
00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:16.920
And of course, once you have that link to your economy,

365
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:20.190
nobody's in a rush to sort of change the status quo.

366
00:22:20.191 --> 00:22:24.090
And that's kind of been the case. I think though, not only is though is the,

367
00:22:24.091 --> 00:22:26.790
will there by most people or many people around the world.

368
00:22:26.791 --> 00:22:31.200
I think starting to see that the, the, the political currency is there as well.

369
00:22:31.201 --> 00:22:34.080
So I think we're doing the show in 10 years.

370
00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.380
It's a different story because I think we're going to be way further down the

371
00:22:37.381 --> 00:22:40.350
line on way more solar and wind.

372
00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.430
<v 0>I mean, 10 years, we're 10 years closer to that, you know,</v>

373
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:49.440
30 years in which we're all gonna die and don't stop burning fossil fuels

374
00:22:49.441 --> 00:22:52.150
and treating the planet. Like we.

375
00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:55.230
<v 2>I don't have a great history as being proactive,</v>

376
00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.450
but we have a pretty good history as being reactive.

377
00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:02.130
<v 0>We, the only, uh, species that could end our own evolution as well.</v>

378
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:06.630
<v 2>I would think so outside of lemmings, I think lemonade can just run off.</v>

379
00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.510
<v 0>Cliffs, but it has a whole, I mean, all over the world,</v>

380
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.040
they can't coordinate there. There's no.

381
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.450
<v 2>I mean, it's, it's, it's funny.</v>

382
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:14.550
Cause we're supposed to be the smartest species in the world.

383
00:23:14.551 --> 00:23:19.320
Yet we have that unique ability, which is you could argue, not smart.

384
00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:25.080
<v 0>Exactly. If you want more with professor Meteo CAC, who, like we said,</v>

385
00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.910
there's the full audio podcast,

386
00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:31.980
click on the link below and you'll get about 20 more minutes with us. And, uh,

387
00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:35.010
professor Michio, Kaku, it's going to be really interesting. Trust me.

388
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:37.620
<v 2>Talking about the future of humanity, which we're kind of doing here,</v>

389
00:23:37.621 --> 00:23:39.900
but of course at a kindergarten level.

390
00:23:39.901 --> 00:23:44.280
So if you want to hear somebody who really has an incredibly visionary

391
00:23:44.281 --> 00:23:45.114
perspective,

392
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:50.660
an exciting and optimistic perspective on the future of the species, humanity,

393
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:53.240
the planet, et cetera, you're going to want to stick around for this.

394
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.320
Cause again, every time we talked to meet you, Okaka we, we usually leave,

395
00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:00.750
you know, kind of you smiling and feeling a lot better about things.

396
00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.713
<v 0>Which he's,</v>

397
00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:06.340
he's talking about things that make you happy rather than it's not the end of

398
00:24:06.341 --> 00:24:11.200
the world for him. It's the possibilities of what we can do. Well said, Peter,

399
00:24:11.201 --> 00:24:14.860
what are the possibilities of you coming back and watching another?

400
00:24:14.861 --> 00:24:19.150
What if discussed maybe next week? Well, why don't you, because this one's over.

401
00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.550
Thanks for joining us here on what if discussed.
