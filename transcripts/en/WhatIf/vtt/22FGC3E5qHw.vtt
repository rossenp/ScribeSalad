00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.070
<v 0>Oh, my God.</v>

2
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.130
<v 1>Welcome to Scotland.</v>

3
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.170
The home of malt scotch killed seven sea monsters.

4
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.110
It's time to get up close and personal with the Loch ness monster

5
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.690
affectionately known as NYSCI.

6
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.020
What species this sheep, what does she eat?

7
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.180
And how would life change if we found her,

8
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.030
this is what if,

9
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.860
and here's what would happen if the Loch ness monster were real,

10
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.160
the Lochness monster is said to be a giant Marine creature residing

11
00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:54.080
in Loch ness. Scotland reports of Nassi go all the way back to

12
00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:56.570
565 CE,

13
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.180
but she became an international sensation in 1934

14
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.070
when physician Robert,

15
00:01:04.071 --> 00:01:08.870
Kenneth Wilson shot this iconic photo reported to

16
00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:11.030
be about two and a half meters long,

17
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.830
messy is said to resemble a dragon or prehistoric monster

18
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.590
rumors even suggest that she's a,

19
00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:22.700
plesiosaur a Marine reptile that went extinct around

20
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.580
65 and a half, million years ago.

21
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.460
So if Nessie really is swimming around the lock,

22
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.080
what kind of animal would we be dealing with? Well,

23
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.590
our bet isn't on some sort of prehistoric creature,

24
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.420
but a giant eel.

25
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.150
And if Nessie is a sort of giant deal, chances are,

26
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.010
she would be carnivorous.

27
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.560
This means she would consume the fish native to the Lake and any small

28
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:59.030
invertebrates she could get Nessie could chow down on pike,

29
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.360
trout, sticklebacks minnows, char,

30
00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:04.370
and other creatures native to the Lake.

31
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.430
Maybe if she were big enough,

32
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.380
she would feed on some unlucky deer or otters that took a dip in the Lake.

33
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.650
But enough about the lock dwellers,

34
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.080
how would the discovery of the Lochness monster change human lives?

35
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.520
I mean, how would we even go about dealing with something like that?

36
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.230
Well,

37
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.940
we don't have to guess because the Scottish government has an official plan in

38
00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:34.460
place in 2001,

39
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.030
the Scottish national heritage agency now called nature.

40
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.670
Scott prepared a code of practice.

41
00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:44.330
If anyone were to find the creature specifically,

42
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.100
the document says that a DNA sample would be taken from the monster to

43
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.180
identify her once. And for all. Ooh,

44
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.200
I think going to experiment on poor Nessie, thankfully, no,

45
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.290
the code States that after taking the DNA sample Nessie will be released

46
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:05.290
back into the lock to sweeten the deal. Even more.

47
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:09.910
The document also describes that the species monster or not

48
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.340
would need to be protected from harm.

49
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.680
This is crucial because once it's confirmed that the Lochness monster

50
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:22.300
exists, curious searchers would be joined by hunters and poachers.

51
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.190
We can only imagine what a taxidermied Nessie would go for on the black market.

52
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.270
So how would a protected Messi repay the people of Scotland?

53
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.360
Well, the Lochness monster would undoubtedly become something of a golden goose.

54
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.820
The Lochness monster contributes almost 41 million British pounds

55
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.870
to the Scottish economy every year. If you could see the monster,

56
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.910
we could expect that figure to skyrocket the tourist industry and

57
00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.190
Blockness would change dramatically.

58
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.650
Maybe there would be Lochness monster tours, just like whale-watching tours.

59
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.350
It's been pretty good since I opened up my hotel in Loch ness,

60
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.610
people come from all over the world to see the monster right from the balconies

61
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.140
trouble is S he's a bit shy and some days she doesn't show up.

62
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.340
So to avoid taking any chances, I invest my money in gold.

63
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.050
Gold can act as a hedge against inflation deflation.

64
00:04:25.051 --> 00:04:28.590
And in this case, the state's fright of a giant sea monster.

65
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.620
It's literally the gold standard for value and can provide financial stability

66
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.480

73

Even without evidence, the legend of Nessie brings the tourists in, in droves.

74
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.620
We are going to see a lock mess. I've done research,

75
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.490
and I know where to look for you. So they support hotels,

76
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.940
souvenir shops, and the local economy as a whole,

77
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.710
with a real messy in the lock. The economy would, boom.

78
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.780
The downside of that is all that attention may overwhelm the area.

79
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.070
And more importantly, it might overwhelm Nestle's ecosystem.

80
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.020
It's possible that the area would need to be restricted to a certain number of

81
00:05:40.021 --> 00:05:43.860
people at a time, sort of like a Safari with humans,

82
00:05:43.861 --> 00:05:46.140
not interacting or disturbing the animal.

83
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.380
So is it possible that Nessie may really be out there?

84
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.940
Maybe there's a chance of discovering a new

85
00:05:58.941 --> 00:05:59.960
species. I mean,

86
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.370
there was a time when people thought the Platypus and Komodo dragon were the

87
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:08.960
stuff of legend. The good news is if Nessie is out there,

88
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.580
Scotland has her back,

89
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.980
but this has us thinking if Nessie is real,

90
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.520
that means some other big contenders are too.

91
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.200
Maybe it's time to look for the world's hide and seek champion.

92
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.760
What if big foot was real? Well,

93
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.920
obviously that's a story for another. What if.

94
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:41.800
