<v 1>410.</v>

6
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.280
<v 0>Kilometers above the earth.</v>

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.210
That's where the international space station floats.

8
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.630
Oh my goodness. I think are going to be sick.

9
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.150
What if you happen to be all the way up here,

10
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.220
but suddenly fell off and had to skydive down to earth.

11
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:39.930
What would happen

12
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.910
Is something like this possible?

13
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.970
How fast would you travel from this height and what would

14
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:53.670
happen once you got back to earth?

15
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.310
This is what if,

16
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.720
and here's what would happen if you skydive from the ISS,

17
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.840
the highest skydive in the world happened from 38 kilometers from earth.

18
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.510
The skydiver reached a speed of over 1300 kilometers per hour

19
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.490
and was in freefall for nearly four minutes and 20 seconds.

20
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.430
Our jump from the ISS would be 10 times as high as that

21
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:24.264
one.

22
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.470
<v 1>What would happen once you jumped off?</v>

23
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.270
<v 0>Well, once you jumped off,</v>

24
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.840
it wouldn't be a simple descent down to the ground.

25
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.920
That's because the ISS is moving at

26
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.580
27,600 kilometers per hour.

27
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.530
That's around 30 times, faster than a commercial airplane.

28
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.600
And if the ISS is moving at this speed, you would be too.

29
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.470
So instead of going straight down to the ground,

30
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.340
you'd be circling the earth while moving at this velocity,

31
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.890
you could potentially circle it for years before your velocity decreased enough

32
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.210
to descend down.

33
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.200
But since we only have a couple of minutes left in the video,

34
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.060
we're going to give you a jet pack with just enough fuel to stop the velocity.

35
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.330
<v 1>Ah, much better, but.</v>

36
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.690
<v 0>Just because we've stopped you from going so fast,</v>

37
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.230
doesn't mean this skydive would be any easier.

38
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.600
Thanks to Earth's gravitational pull you'd now be thrust towards the

39
00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:34.880
planet surface instead of around it.

40
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.420
As you plummeted down to the earth surface,

41
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.860
you'd be moving at over 2000 kilometers per hour,

42
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.040
depending on your weight. And at this speed,

43
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.230
you would be experiencing over six G-forces during the

44
00:02:51.231 --> 00:02:52.550
longest skydive ever.

45
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.620
The diver involved experienced four G-forces that's comparable

46
00:02:57.621 --> 00:02:59.090
to a pretty intense

47
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.870
and fighter pilots experienced six G-forces when flying their jets.

48
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.180
But that takes a lot of practice and only happens or short periods

49
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.370
suddenly experiencing six G-forces with no prior practice

50
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.150
would feel like the most intense thrill ride of your life.

51
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.140
And this would only be the start of your speed.

52
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.680
As you move through the Earth's atmosphere,

53
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.500
your momentum would continue to increase.

54
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.180
You'd be moving so fast that you'd compress the air in front of you

55
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.550
causing it to heat up to temperatures as high as 1600 degrees.

56
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.090
As you continued heading toward earth,

57
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.480
you'd be experiencing more and more G-forces.

58
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.820
This would be like having eight times the amount of gravitational force you

59
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.440
typically experience on earth.

60
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.970
This kind of energy would likely cause you to lose consciousness.

61
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.620
Your blood vessels would burst and your organs would be shifting around

62
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.550
this pain would be incredibly excruciating.

63
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.210
But if you could hold out for just a bit longer,

64
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.190
your velocity would begin to slow down as the density of the air increased,

65
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.930
giving you more resistance.

66
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.130
If you somehow managed to wake up around this time at around

67
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.960
2,500 meters above sea level,

68
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.570
you could deploy a parachute and now you could enjoy the sights

69
00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:31.950
as you come down to earth.

70
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.530
Just remember that once you land you'd need to get medical help immediately,

71
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.130
you'd likely have some internal bleeding and maybe some broken bones due to all

72
00:04:44.131 --> 00:04:46.710
that gravitational pressure you've just experienced.

73
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.830
But what if you weren't lucky enough to have a parachute and fell

74
00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:56.460
out of an airplane without one? Well,

75
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.320
that sounds like a story for another. What if.
