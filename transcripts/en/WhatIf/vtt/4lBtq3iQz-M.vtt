1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.830
<v 0>They're sneaky.</v>

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.480
They're slimy and they're hungry for meat.

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.540
The hagfish or slime meal has earned its name due to its

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.320
unique defense mechanism. When they're agitated,

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.970
heck fish can secrete slime to choke unsuspecting predators,

6
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.020
even sharks, fall prey to their gunky wrath.

7
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.080
This makes us wonder what would happen if you fell

8
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.000
into a pool full of them,

9
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.900
what makes the heck fish so unique?

10
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.120
How does hagfish slime expand so rapidly?

11
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.830
And why is the hagfish useful to us?

12
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.650
This is whatever,

13
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.180
and here's what would happen if you fell into a pool of hagfish

14
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.540
hagfish I've been around for hundreds.

15
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.520
<v 1>Of millions of years and are the only known living animal with a skull,</v>

16
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.930
but no spine.

17
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.930
They are also jawless creatures with the unique ability to absorb

18
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.760
nutrients through their skin.

19
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.970
Using four sets of teeth on their tongue.

20
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.750
Hagfish like to burrow inside sea creatures,

21
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.410
dead and alive and digest them over time.

22
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.993
Their bodies.

23
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.380
<v 2>Are lined with special glands that secrete screeny proteins.</v>

24
00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:32.600
When the hagfish feels agitated,

25
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.970
this slime can expand 10,000 times larger in under a

26
00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:41.810
second, making it a lethal choking hazard to predators.

27
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.950
So could you survive in a pool full of them?

28
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.680
Hobbyists are actually turning their pools.

29
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.850
<v 3>Into self-sustaining ecosystems for fish and plants known.</v>

30
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.650
<v 1>As an aquaponic system.</v>

31
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.600
If you're feeling adventurous and want to adopt hundreds of hagfish,

32
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.000
you'll need a cold salt water pool to mimic their natural habitat and

33
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.730
enough dead fish to feed them in.

34
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:14.000
<v 3>The unfortunate event that you slip and fall into the pool.</v>

35
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.220
<v 1>You might still be okay if you're close to the surface as</v>

36
00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:22.910
bottom dwellers, they may not even react to you being there,

37
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.430
but if you happen to disturb them,

38
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.200
the water would start to get very slimy, very quickly,

39
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.420
making it difficult to swim.

40
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.450
The slime isn't actually sticky, but it is particularly strong.

41
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.020
It would tangle around your toes, fingers, ears,

42
00:02:42.021 --> 00:02:45.260
and the crevices of your body. If it got.

43
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.200
<v 3>In your mouth and started to expand it in your throat.</v>

44
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.260
<v 1>You could choke very quickly and drown.</v>

45
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.250
Eventually the hagfish would feast on your body.

46
00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.370
It's not exactly a nice way to go. Also. You might want to be extra.

47
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.460
<v 3>Careful if you're driving near trucks for hagfish</v>

48
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.950
hagfish slime is amusing like snot,

49
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.110
except that it doesn't dry out.

50
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.650
Someone give me a tissue, please.

51
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.780
The mucin is made up of long fibers like spider silk,

52
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.500
which are arranged in small bundles, known as skeins.

53
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.750
<v 4>When these skeins come into contact with seawater, the glue,</v>

54
00:03:27.751 --> 00:03:32.520
holding them together, dissolves, and the slime expands rapidly.

55
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.160
These slime microfibers are stronger than nylon thinner than human hair.

56
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.760
And 100,000 times softer than jello.

57
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.130
This makes hagfish slime and exceptionally useful and environmentally

58
00:03:47.131 --> 00:03:51.930
friendly fabric. In fact, it's used to make safety helmets, Kevlar,

59
00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:56.790
vests, and even airbags and researchers are investigating.

60
00:03:56.791 --> 00:04:01.590
Whether it could be used as a hydro gel to hold water in soil for

61
00:04:01.591 --> 00:04:06.510
farming hagfish are also considered a delicacy in Korean

62
00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:10.350
cuisine and are used in many delicious stir fry recipes.

63
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.210
So maybe if you're careful, you could harvest them as a business.

64
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.220
<v 3>Whatever the situation is. If you're swimming deep in the ocean,</v>

65
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.800
be aware of the many risks involved,

66
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.700
you might even come face to face with a giant squid,

67
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.430
but that's a story for another. What if.
