1
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.450
<v 1>That was pretty cool,</v>

2
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.170
but could we do even better?

3
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.220
What if instead of compressed air,

4
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.520
we filled the cannon with liquid nitrogen.

5
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.980
Could you live through this ordeal without getting frozen in the process?

6
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.290
How far would you go and how much would this cost you?

7
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.110
This is what if,

8
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.790
and here's what would happen if you were shot out of a liquid nitrogen Canon.

9
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.090
<v 0>That is liquid nitrogen it's non-toxic,</v>

10
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.550
it has no smell and no color.

11
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.500
And it boils at minus 196 degrees Celsius

12
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.880
at this temperature. Your body would instantly freeze,

13
00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:02.420
but for liquid nitrogen, it's like a sauna.

14
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.800
<v 1>If you got shot out of a real cannon,</v>

15
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.720
you'd fly out with gunpowder burns on your body at the very least

16
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.030
to make it a safer trick.

17
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.920
Stuntman use compressed air to push forward the platform they stand on inside

18
00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:23.750
the cannon. Basically it's a catapult masquerading as a cannon.

19
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.910
So let's fill this catapult with some liquid nitrogen.

20
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.160
And in this scenario, you'd be like the court in a champagne bottle.

21
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.460
Of course we wouldn't send you flying out of a liquid nitrogen Canon right away

22
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.240
for your safety. We perform some dummy tests.

23
00:01:44.241 --> 00:01:48.710
First we'd need to figure out how much liquid nitrogen we'd need and

24
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.830
calculate where to put a net to catch you safely.

25
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.580
We don't want this story to end up with you smashed all over the ground

26
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.350
For this human cannon ball to work. You'd need to be pretty thin.

27
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.020
I don't mean to tell you to lose some weight,

28
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.530
but my calculations say that the lighter the person,

29
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.740
the less force it takes to shoot them out of the cannon.

30
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.080
If you're light enough,

31
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.160
you'd only need 750 liters of liquid nitrogen.

32
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.540
And if you heat up the Canon walls a bit, right before you launch,

33
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.610
you can get by with only 400 liters of the stuff that sounds expensive.

34
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.690
I wonder what the.

35
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.260
<v 0>Cost of liquid nitrogen is these days. Hang on. I'll do a search.</v>

36
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.810
When I search, I always use a VPN. I use private internet access.

37
00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:40.910
It's one of the top VPNs in the world.

38
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:44.360
It's got over 30 million downloads worldwide. Now,

39
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.530
if you don't know what VPN stands for, it's virtual private network.

40
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.670
It keeps your IP address hidden with private internet access.

41
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.140
All your internet traffic goes through a secure VPN tunnel and your data's

42
00:02:57.141 --> 00:03:01.660
encrypted private internet access works on all platforms.

43
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:04.810
I've got it on one of my windows, computers on my Mac computer,

44
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:06.940
and I use an Android phone. I've got it on there too.

45
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.830
Just one subscription works to protect 10 different devices. It blocks ads,

46
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.790
trackers, malware, and it's got a strict, no logs policy.

47
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:19.150
So you know that they're not holding onto your information just to hand over to

48
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:22.420
somebody else. Plus there's a 30 day money back guarantee.

49
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:24.070
So you've got nothing to lose.

50
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.440
You can use it for accessing geo restricted content from websites,

51
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.600
YouTube included or browsing.

52
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:35.800
Social networks are finding better deals online and playing games blocks in your

53
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:36.634
region,

54
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.380
protect your identity by keeping your data encrypted and away from the snooping

55
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:46.030
eyes of your internet service provider and from hackers and from spammers,

56
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.800
stay safe.

57
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.000
You don't need anybody knowing what you're doing or where you're going. Okay.

58
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:56.320
Now, where was I? Oh, liquid nitrogen costs. Ooh.

59
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.110
It looks like you're going to be spending about a thousand dollars to get.

60
00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.330
<v 1>Theoretically you'd fly a distance of about 60 meters sailing 23</v>

61
00:04:06.331 --> 00:04:10.530
meters up in the air before landing in a net lease. That's the plan.

62
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.240
After all the tests were done, everything would be good to go.

63
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.070
Are you ready?

64
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.380
I'm kind of worried about you you'd climb right into the Canyon.

65
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.730
It would be a snug fit. So hopefully you're not claustrophobic.

66
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.980
As you stood there waiting your assistance would heat the Canon

67
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.870
slightly, but enough for you to break into a sweat. From there,

68
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.730
things would go pretty fast.

69
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.990
The assistance would pour liquid nitrogen into the bottom of the Canon.

70
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.510
Instantly the liquid nitrogen would heat up and turn into gas in a

71
00:04:48.511 --> 00:04:49.650
fraction of a second,

72
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.480
the gas would expand and propel the platform you were standing on forward

73
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.460
a split-second later,

74
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.050
you'd be flying at the speed of 112 kilometers per hour,

75
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.290
but something's not right. When we were testing the dummy,

76
00:05:07.291 --> 00:05:09.030
we kind of forgot about something.

77
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.520
Liquid nitrogen is really cold before the Canon shot

78
00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:15.240
you out.

79
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.080
The nitrogen would have to be stored in a sealed container at a temperature

80
00:05:19.081 --> 00:05:21.330
below 196 degrees.

81
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.750
Once the liquid nitrogen was poured into the Canon,

82
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.860
you'd find yourself in a cloud of this gas all around you.

83
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.470
Liquid nitrogen can be pretty deadly for humans because as it

84
00:05:34.471 --> 00:05:37.890
evaporates it displaces the oxygen around it.

85
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.860
And did I mention it's insanely cold.

86
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.370
You'd pass out and freeze if you stayed in that cloud long enough,

87
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.590
but luckily for you,

88
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.240
our Cannonball events would be unfolding too fast for the gas to cause any

89
00:05:51.241 --> 00:05:55.440
permanent damage to your body. Thanks to the lightened frost effect.

90
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.640
The quick contact with nitrogen inside the cannon,

91
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.260
wouldn't instantly freeze your skin. The nitrogen wouldn't even touch it.

92
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.450
Only hover above its surface. If somebody hit you with a hammer after the stunt,

93
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.970
your body wouldn't shatter to dust,

94
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.160
there would be no visible effects at all, except the bruise from the hammer,

95
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.210
ouch, but it would sting badly.

96
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.190
Your whole body would be in sharp pain as you went flying towards the net.

97
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.280
But Hey, at least you'd still be alive.

98
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.820
You'd be accelerating rapidly.

99
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.110
It would feel as if gravity just got nine times stronger.

100
00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.350
That could make you pass out on the flight.

101
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.500
And if you didn't pass out by this point,

102
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.650
seeing the net would sure make you feel on edge,

103
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.810
but you got lucky again, as you dropped right into it,

104
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.090
the net slowed your velocity and made the impact less intense

105
00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.310
that didn't cost you your life. But I wouldn't do this again. If I were you,

106
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.250
maybe if you like liquid nitrogen so much, you could try jumping into a pool,

107
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.350
completely filled with liquid nitrogen,

108
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.930
but that's a story for another. What if.
