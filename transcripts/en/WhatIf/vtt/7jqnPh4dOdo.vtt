1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.300
<v 0>This is the universe.</v>

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.930
And this little.here is the earth,

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.230
and this is a big bounce coming up.

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.050
And it's about to squash our planet.

5
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.320
<v 1>How long would we have until the earth got crushed into nothingness?</v>

6
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.410
What would we observe from down here and what would happen

7
00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:28.244
next?

8
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.610
<v 0>This is what if,</v>

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.840
and here's what would happen if the universe was bouncing,

10
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.530
it's generally accepted that the universe emerged from one single point of

11
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.360
infinite density and then rapidly expanded in what we call the big

12
00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:50.660
bang. But when it happened,

13
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.750
nobody was around to see it for themselves.

14
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.360
So here comes a new theory.

15
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.980
What if it all didn't start with the big bang

16
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.900
13.8 billion years ago? What if instead,

17
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.530
the universe had no beginning and no end,

18
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.600
but it was expanding and contracting back over and over again.

19
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.690
The cyclical universe involves a series of big bouncers where

20
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.310
the universe acts like an enormous cosmic lung inhaling and

21
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.350
exhaling a giant breath with every bounce. Basically,

22
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.480
you've got nothing to worry about because the cyclic universe expands for

23
00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:40.160
several billion years and then contracts for billions of

24
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:43.010
years on a scale of a human lifespan.

25
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.330
This timeline is just not developing fast enough to affect you in any way.

26
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.570
But we here at what F like to add some spice to our stories in this case,

27
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.130
we'll speed things up and have the universe go through its bouncing cycle almost

28
00:01:58.131 --> 00:01:58.964
every day.

29
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.620
And the next bouncing event is scheduled for tomorrow.

30
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.590
You'd start the day with some worrisome news from astrophysicists,

31
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.590
the stars and galaxies that normally move slowly away from each other

32
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.910
would now be moving toward one another and fast.

33
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.940
Every planet star and every galaxy on the edge of the universe would be

34
00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:29.870
rushing towards its center. Breaking the cosmic Lightspeed limit.

35
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.730
Black holes would be colliding with other black holes.

36
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.160
They'd be sending huge amounts of cosmic radiation in all directions and

37
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.100
growing into even bigger black holes.

38
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.440
Nope. Planet in the universe would have a stable orbit anymore.

39
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.930
They'd go flying across the galaxy to meet up at the cosmic downtown.

40
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.713
At this point,

41
00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.570
things would get quite messy on our planet and you wouldn't be able to do a

42
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:04.970
thing to stop it. So who just sit back.

43
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.003
<v 1>I see the world and</v>

44
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.040
as the universe continued to collapse in on itself,

45
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.350
its temperature would rapidly become hotter. The soup.

46
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.310
<v 0>Heated temperatures would evaporate our oceans, our planet,</v>

47
00:03:20.311 --> 00:03:21.750
and even our atoms.

48
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.950
Everything that ever existed would be wiped out.

49
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.860
Finally, when the universe can practice to its densest point,

50
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.460
it would become a super hot dense mix of matter.

51
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.970
It would slow down for a moment and then suddenly start expanding again.

52
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.360
A new bouncing cycle would begin a totally new universe would

53
00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:51.750
emerge new universe,

54
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.500
old rules from hot cosmic dust.

55
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.910
Gravity would form new planets, new stars and new galaxies.

56
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.380
And then new life forms would emerge on these new worlds.

57
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.180
This new universe would expand until it reaches its limit.

58
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.860
And then it would go back to becoming a dense hot ball of matter.

59
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.020
The cycle would repeat and again and again,

60
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.410
but we would be too long gone to know about it.

61
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.260
Well that turned out a bit dark, but Hey,

62
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.890
the universe is only 13.8 billion years old.

63
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.110
We've got a few billion more until the contraction will begin.

64
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.850
And honestly, it's quite a deep topic to dive into.

65
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.400
We've got more questions and there's no one better to ask them to then

66
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.090
the very person who developed this cyclical model of the universe

67
00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.650
on what if discussed? We talked to Dr. Anna,

68
00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.030
[inaudible] a theoretical physicist at the max Planck Institute for

69
00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:01.320
gravitational physics.

70
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.050
Check it out to learn more about the big bounce and how dark matter fits into

71
00:05:07.051 --> 00:05:07.200
it.
