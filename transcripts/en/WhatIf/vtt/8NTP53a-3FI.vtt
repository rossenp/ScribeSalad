00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:07.580
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.520
<v 1>Imagine you're out for a blissful swim,</v>

3
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.270
trying to catch a glimpse of some beautiful whales.

4
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.130
The sun is shining. The water feels refreshing and Oh,

5
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.920
something just brushed past your leg.

6
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.930
Something slimy, slithery,

7
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.220
something really, really big.

8
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.920
A giant squid has decided your next meal.

9
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.520
How did a giant squid get the drop on you?

10
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.340
Are you going to be next on the dinner menu and how

11
00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:49.760
can your measly two arms take on

12
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.090
this is what if,

13
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.410
and here's what would happen if you were attacked by a giant squid,

14
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.990
Giant squids are one of the ocean's most enduring mysteries.

15
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.540
They live in the deepest waters of the ocean and are rarely seen by humans.

16
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.740
In fact,

17
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.690
most of the stuff we do know about them is from dead carcasses that wash

18
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.230
onto shore, like it's smaller relatives.

19
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.640
The giant squid has two eyes, a beak, eight arms,

20
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.880
two feeding, tentacles, and a siphon,

21
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.440
all stuff you don't want swimming up against you. Giant squids,

22
00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:36.860
mostly eat deep water fishes and other squids,

23
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.690
including going full on Hannibal Lecter and eating their own kind.

24
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.340
And they do not mess around. In fact,

25
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.180
they're known to attack entire schools of fish from below.

26
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.440
Once they grab a meal with the suckers on their feeding tentacles,

27
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.620
they drag the prey down to their sharp beak.

28
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.520
This cuts the prey into more manageable pieces.

29
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.600
And as if you weren't already too scared to ever go swimming again,

30
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.600
they start doing even more damage.

31
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.050
The giant squid then uses its Wrangler,

32
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.900
which is like a tongue covered with teeth.

33
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.600
This slices and dices,

34
00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:25.520
the prey up into even tinier bite-sized pieces. Dinner is served.

35
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.110
Maybe you should get out of the water like right now,

36
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.550
if you're unlucky enough to be hunted by a giant squid,

37
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.860
I've got some bad news for you. The giant squids, sheer size strength,

38
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.701
speed,

39
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:45.440
and hunting abilities would make it extremely difficult to escape.

40
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.240
The first stealthy move it would make is attacking you from below

41
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.210
horrifying, right? Well, it gets worse. The giant squid,

42
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.470
probably isn't going to devour you right then there,

43
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.540
it's going to drag you into deep water where it feels safe from its own

44
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:07.720
predators, because it's so fast,

45
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.700
you would definitely struggle with the changing pressure and your eardrums

46
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:17.470
would certainly burst this speedy whiplash may also break some of your

47
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:20.350
bones from the giant squid, holding you so tight.

48
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.990
If you're somehow not dead by being gripped and scraped by the feeding

49
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:26.824
tentacles,

50
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.690
the giant squid would use a whole of its arms to bring you to its beak.

51
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.670
If you're at this stage, the hope of escape is pretty non-existent.

52
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.010
The giant squid is using all of its strength to pull you in for dinner.

53
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.340
And I know it's a bad time to say this, but.

54
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.620
<v 0>It won't be a quick death.</v>

55
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.910
<v 1>You see giant squids have a bit of a gag reflex problem.</v>

56
00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:54.970
So they're going to eat you nice and slow.

57
00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.910
This is it. You close your eyes and prepare to be squid food.

58
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.080
<v 0>Wait, what's that sound?</v>

59
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.470
<v 1>Yeah, your buddy, the sperm whale has come.</v>

60
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.600
<v 0>To the rescue. Now.</v>

61
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.100
<v 1>Giant squids don't have much in the way of predators, but sperm whales.</v>

62
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.680
Yeah. They stay away from those guys.

63
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.270
Researchers have found giant squid beaks in the stomachs of sperm,

64
00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:25.620
whales and battle wounds from giant suckers on their bodies.

65
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.990
This means that your new best friend has a taste for supersized

66
00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:35.880
calamari, the giant squid. Isn't going down without a fight though,

67
00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:38.460
and we'll go toe to toe with the sperm whale.

68
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.000
Now I know it would be super cool to watch,

69
00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:45.750
but I think you're forgetting something you're still under water.

70
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.360
If by some miracle,

71
00:04:48.361 --> 00:04:53.100
you make it back to landed one piece and you're going to have quite the story to

72
00:04:53.101 --> 00:04:56.220
tell it's a shame. No one will ever believe you.

73
00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.580
This is because giant squid sightings,

74
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.100
let alone attacks are so rare.

75
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.580
We still have so much to learn about them.

76
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.590
There could be millions of them lurking in the deep waters and we wouldn't even

77
00:05:10.591 --> 00:05:14.040
know. And well beyond them,

78
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.290
there could be tons of other creatures,

79
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.570
lurking and unexplored parts of the ocean.

80
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.160
The good news is it can't get any worse than a giant squid,

81
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.450
right? Oh, geez. I really got to stop jinxing myself.

82
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.600
What if the cracking was real?

83
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.240
<v 0>Wow, that's a story or another, what is.</v>
