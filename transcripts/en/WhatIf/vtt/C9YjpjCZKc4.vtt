WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.970
<v 0>Possibly. And it's not in a, so far future.</v>

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.040
We may have a clear evidence that they are alive on some of this planet

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.233
so far.

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.100
It's quite amazing that we all in one of the systems that looks pretty much

5
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:16.590
different from all the planet that we have found.

6
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.960
So is it the reason why they are alive because we are different or it's

7
00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:25.190
just a matter of luck here. And I think this kind of question,

8
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.600
we should be able to answer.

9
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.880
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

10
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.300
<v 2>So Pete,</v>

11
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.480
we've been really lucky on the show because we've had some pretty incredible

12
00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:48.140
guests, right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, just a top of my mind, we can,

13
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.140
can count bill Nye. A couple of times the science guy,

14
00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:55.610
friend of the show meets you a cat. A couple of times science communicator, uh,

15
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.160
Elma, Emily calender. Alli was a fun one. Uh,

16
00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:02.750
we had Dr. [inaudible] who taught us, uh, better how to live in space,

17
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.470
which is kind of where we're going to end up today. We're not living in space,

18
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.360
but we will be talking about space,

19
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.280
but we have not had a Nobel prize winner. Have we, are we having one today?

20
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.590
We are Pete. Oh, this is good. It's,

21
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.900
it's really funny for this show because I mean,

22
00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:21.080
a it's really cool to have somebody that's obviously accomplished something like

23
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:24.860
that, but you know, we've discussed exoplanets on the show. What five times,

24
00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:29.180
10 times, like, because it's such a big part of where we're at,

25
00:01:29.181 --> 00:01:32.220
but where we're going in terms of cosmological research,

26
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.420
thinking about, you know, where are we,

27
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.110
if everyone assumes the planet is going to self-destruct at some point,

28
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.890
we're all going to have to go somewhere. So the, the fun, what F is to like,

29
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.670
think about how we're going to go somewhere and maybe get to an exoplanet.

30
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.100
It's a, it's a new era, the, the new frontiers,

31
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.800
as they used to say in star Trek, but you know, not long ago,

32
00:01:51.801 --> 00:01:55.400
we've discussed that number of people generally say over 4,000 exoplanets,

33
00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:57.890
but 25 years ago, there were none.

34
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.870
We had not discovered any exoplanets except our

35
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.621
guest today.

36
00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:08.540
And his team were the people that in 1995 were the

37
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.360
discovers of that very first exoplanet.

38
00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:15.350
That's created this entire new era of cosmological,

39
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.830
astronomical research. That's not just exciting people in the field.

40
00:02:18.831 --> 00:02:23.060
It's exciting everybody in the world because it does feel like we're sort of

41
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.440
going into that next frontier of human exploration. It's wildly exciting.

42
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.750
And we're super honored to have a Nobel prize winning astronomer DDA, Kelo.

43
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.480
Join us today on what if discussed professor?

44
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:37.100
How are you welcome to what else has got?

45
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.070
<v 0>I'm fine. Thank you for the invitation.</v>

46
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.000
<v 2>It's great to have you. And again, as, as Peter and I were talking about,</v>

47
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.020
exoplanets has been a big part of many conversations we've had on this show

48
00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:51.320
before we get into the sort of the big wood ifs, uh,

49
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.270
we're all sort of excited to hear about your excitement

50
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.180
that day, that fateful day. I mean, it's, it's hard to even put it into words,

51
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:05.620
what it would be like making a discovery like that. Take us back to that day,

52
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:07.360
that moment. So, and what that was like.

53
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.970
<v 0>Well, I think we were not expecting to find a planet like that.</v>

54
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.760
So it came up really a big surprise.

55
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.150
It was not part of my program to detect this.

56
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.980
So I really believe that was anything else about the planet. First one,

57
00:03:22.981 --> 00:03:26.640
I saw the data, but after battling with the data,

58
00:03:26.641 --> 00:03:29.370
I came up with this very bizarre conclusion.

59
00:03:29.371 --> 00:03:32.880
They must be a planet like Jupiter with a very short orbit.

60
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.930
And at that time it was absolutely a crazy statement.

61
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.100
My PhD advisor did not believe you right away. He had,

62
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.460
he could give him some months to really realize that I was right.

63
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.110
And I think he took clearly a couple of years for the community to really

64
00:03:49.111 --> 00:03:50.490
swallow this baby.

65
00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:55.110
It was really difficult to believe that the very reason

66
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.270
is the planet was like Jupiter,

67
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.800
but it was orbiting the star way closer than the albeit of

68
00:04:01.801 --> 00:04:04.410
mercury. It was really a rusted Jupiter.

69
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.580
That's why we call them the hot Jupiter and this kind of planet doesn't exist in

70
00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:12.420
the solar system. And even not predicted by the theory,

71
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.650
it's even worse than that. The predicted the theory tell you it must not exist.

72
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.480
So the first planet to be found or beating another star was indeed the

73
00:04:21.481 --> 00:04:24.570
planet that should have never existed, but there are plenty.

74
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.860
<v 2>Wow. Well, I'm guessing there's a range of criteria too,</v>

75
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.640
and that not all exoplanets are the same. So what,

76
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.170
what are the key attributes to becoming a, an exoplanet or to qualify as one?

77
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.510
<v 0>Well, I think we,</v>

78
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.290
we started to find the most obvious one with the technique we had,

79
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.000
which is looking for variability in the velocity of the stars.

80
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.440
You can also pick planet if the plan goes right in front of the star,

81
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.270
which is called transits. Um, no, um, essentially what is a planet is,

82
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.490
is something orbiting a star, which is of the mass of a planet. Like we know.

83
00:05:02.491 --> 00:05:06.690
So if you have anything like a tributary of a Neptune of earth orbiting a star,

84
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.130
well, you qualify as a planet and you really understand, uh,

85
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.080
that this object must have formed somewhat from a structure that

86
00:05:16.081 --> 00:05:18.210
we call a Pato plant or a disc.

87
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.280
And the origin of the formation of this planet into the disc should tell you

88
00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:28.140
something about the nature of the planet and the chemistry of the planet and the

89
00:05:28.141 --> 00:05:30.900
possible atmosphere you may have on this planet.

90
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.560
<v 2>Yeah. Wildly exciting stuff. We're going to take a quick break.</v>

91
00:05:34.561 --> 00:05:37.770
We'll be back more with professor Kelo. On the other side,

92
00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:42.240
you are watching and listening to what if discussed Richard?

93
00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:46.620
Let's talk about healthy eating kits. Let's okay. Well, I've been, uh,

94
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.720
hearing a lot about green chef recently,

95
00:05:48.721 --> 00:05:50.610
and I think it might be the best one out there.

96
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.900
Green chef is the first USDA certified organic meal company.

97
00:05:54.901 --> 00:05:59.540
They make eating whale easy and with plans to fit every lifestyle.

98
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:03.650
So whether you're keto or paleo, vegan, vegetarian,

99
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.960
some people are just looking to eat healthier. Well,

100
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:08.720
they've got recipes to suit any diet or preference.

101
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:09.740
And that's the key right now.

102
00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:12.680
Obviously we know sort of these food delivery services have blown up,

103
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.420
but we don't want to sort of start eating unhealthy and everybody getting off

104
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.430
there, whether it's paleo, whether it's keto,

105
00:06:19.431 --> 00:06:22.910
the fact that you can now get that delivered, you know, quality,

106
00:06:22.911 --> 00:06:26.900
but also the ability to make it easier. Uh, you know, I think it's,

107
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.840
it goes without saying it's huge. Yeah. I think it's going to stick around too.

108
00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:31.360
I think it's really important to the,

109
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.760
and if you're thinking it's just a big green box of organic vegetables,

110
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.330
which nobody wants nobody. Well, some people want that and that's, that's fine,

111
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:42.140
but this is actually meal kits. So, which is what I want. Yes.

112
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.930
Ingredients come premeasured, mostly prepped.

113
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:46.730
So you'll spend less time stressing,

114
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.250
more time enjoying delicious home cooked meals.

115
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.260
Plus they offer 100% offset of the direct carbon emissions

116
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:55.610
and their plastic packaging.

117
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.750
So you can feel good about what you're getting and how it got to your table to

118
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:04.580
sign up, go to green chef.com/what if 90 and use the code.

119
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.110
What if 90 to get $90 off 90 bucks off

120
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.420
plus free shipping? Yeah.

121
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.950
So that's green chef.com/what if 90 use the code?

122
00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:17.990
What if 90 to get $90 off,

123
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.670
including free shipping or free shipping or green Scheffing

124
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.660
green chef, the number one meal kit for eating well.

125
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.150
So professor it's been 25 years since you and your team made that

126
00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:33.230
discovery.

127
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:38.270
Obviously we know technology changes at a crazy exponential

128
00:07:38.271 --> 00:07:40.370
rate pretty much year to year. These days,

129
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.220
we hear about things like the dynamite model.

130
00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:47.240
We hear other sort of new introductions to this search for other planets.

131
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:52.280
What is some of the technology and new science that exists in the field of

132
00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:54.050
discovering new exoplanets?

133
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.090
<v 0>Well, we had improved quite a lot. Um,</v>

134
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.590
the tools that we were using at that time to detect planet,

135
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:08.050
well, first the machine that measured that steel, the speed of the stub, uh,

136
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.250
the accuracy or the precision we get to the measurements has increased by a

137
00:08:12.251 --> 00:08:15.760
factor of a hundred because we have been using plenty of new techniques,

138
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:16.930
optics component.

139
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.940
Now we have been flying satellite that have been pretty efficient about finding

140
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.290
planet. One of the famous one is capita. They kept permissions rhino.

141
00:08:26.291 --> 00:08:31.240
There is a test satellite and the satellite flying and sooner they will be

142
00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:32.470
the Plato satellites.

143
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.420
All this is a new development that helped us to find smaller planet or

144
00:08:37.421 --> 00:08:39.100
planet on different kind of style.

145
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.810
But the big change is coming with the new generations of

146
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:47.650
very large telescope. So we I'd say the community,

147
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.080
the surgical community in the world,

148
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.520
or building the next generations of telescopes.

149
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:59.160
The size of the meal hall of the stethoscope will range from 30 meter to

150
00:08:59.161 --> 00:09:03.990
40 meter diameter, which are really huge. It's a messy progress.

151
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.010
It's a complete new kind of pick from a Jeep. And with this machine,

152
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.720
we will be able to make picture of some of this planet

153
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.310
and talking about space in less than a year.

154
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:21.660
We will be flying the next space telescope,

155
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.560
which is a gem swept space that a scopes. And with these telescope,

156
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:30.150
we are going to measure atmosphere of some of these

157
00:09:30.151 --> 00:09:32.040
transiting planet that we have found,

158
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:37.320
especially the smaller ones for which we have a lot of questions to

159
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:40.530
ask, because we have little idea, all this, uh,

160
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.630
what we call super earth planet,

161
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.480
or really are being formed and what they look like.

162
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:50.310
And we will have a lot of surprises and good ones I can tell you.

163
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.680
<v 2>Wow, just, uh, just so you know, DDA, the,</v>

164
00:09:53.681 --> 00:09:58.550
the 30 meter mirror is what Richard uses to get ready every morning.

165
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:03.530
That's what it requires me to get ready for the show with 30 meter year,

166
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:07.640
you've been on record as playing down the possibility of us, uh,

167
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:12.230
one day migrating to an exoplanet. And that's probably because of the distance,

168
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.440
but let's say we get in our, what if time machine and Richard,

169
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:19.790
or you can give me a little bit of sound effects and we've solved the practical

170
00:10:19.791 --> 00:10:24.200
issue of, of getting there. So we get there then what,

171
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:25.063
what F.

172
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:30.380
<v 0>Well, I think we should acknowledge that. It's unlikely. We'll go there anytime,</v>

173
00:10:30.381 --> 00:10:32.330
but it doesn't matter. I mean,

174
00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:35.150
you can look at the earth without going to the earth.

175
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:38.210
We have plenty of satellite that is looking at the earth.

176
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:42.290
So what you can retrieve by remote

177
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:47.690
looking at something is just absolutely amazing. So we will look,

178
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:50.810
we the amazing details on this planet.

179
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:55.730
And we will know whether they have a surface we know about kind of

180
00:10:55.731 --> 00:11:00.230
rocks or on the surface. We don't need to go there to get an idea what it is.

181
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.530
We will know whether that is water split,

182
00:11:03.531 --> 00:11:07.100
easy to detect water had made very strong, spectral signature.

183
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:11.900
We will know whether the planet rotates, who we know, whether the continents,

184
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.450
all these would be possible remotely.

185
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.430
And we may have evidence from the chemistry of the atmosphere that

186
00:11:19.431 --> 00:11:24.080
something is going on on this planet that cannot be only explained by

187
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:29.030
it, say the geophysics of the planet, and it must be related to life.

188
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.240
And this is the most exciting, I think,

189
00:11:32.241 --> 00:11:37.010
prospect that we have that possibly, and it's not in a, so far future.

190
00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:42.020
We may have a clear evidence that they are alive on

191
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:46.760
some of this planet for maybe there is no life on this

192
00:11:46.761 --> 00:11:49.280
planet. And that really a big question.

193
00:11:49.281 --> 00:11:53.980
And I think this will tell us a lot about ourselves because so he's quite

194
00:11:53.981 --> 00:11:58.780
amazing that we all in one of the systems that looks pretty much different

195
00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.790
from all the planet that we have found.

196
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:06.070
So is it the reason why they are life because we are different or it's

197
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:07.540
just a matter of luck here.

198
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.810
And I think this kind of question we should be able to answer.

199
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:16.230
<v 2>I mean, it's, it's hard to overstate how wildly exciting these times are.</v>

200
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.180
And you know what,

201
00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:21.450
when you look back in a thousand years on this particular time in history,

202
00:12:21.451 --> 00:12:26.040
it will be the beginning of an entirely new era professor. Honestly, that's,

203
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:29.130
there's so much more to talk about. You talked about the possibilities,

204
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:33.510
discovering intelligent life in the universe. We haven't gotten even talk about,

205
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:38.010
uh, the, the fantastic Netflix series, alien worlds,

206
00:12:38.011 --> 00:12:39.840
which you are obviously a big part of,

207
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:44.910
which helps us imagine what some of these exoplanets might look like.

208
00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.760
If there was life there it's so highly recommended.

209
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.240
We want to talk about that and more on the other side of the break professor,

210
00:12:51.241 --> 00:12:55.440
can you stick around? I can. Fantastic.

211
00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:57.480
We'll be back more with professor Kelo. Yeah.

212
00:12:57.481 --> 00:13:02.190

to it. Well, we'll be back after the break. Um,

216
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.100
and professor w before we let our viewers go, uh,

217
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.580
maybe you can tell them where they can find your work online or anywhere else.

218
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.400
<v 0>Well, I think if you Google my name,</v>

219
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:25.410
you will be amazing how many movies and recording the off my talks of my

220
00:13:25.411 --> 00:13:28.680
work. So just, just use the Google search machine.

221
00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.430
<v 2>Quick, Google search on the old magic box. All right.</v>

222
00:13:32.431 --> 00:13:36.570
So for those of you who are ready to go further into space, click that link,

223
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:38.520
and if that's all the time you have for us, well,

224
00:13:38.521 --> 00:13:41.040
thanks for joining us on what if discussed?
