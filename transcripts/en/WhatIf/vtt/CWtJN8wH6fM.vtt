1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.310
<v 0>Well, the difference is in the communication methods.</v>

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.930
If you play with strangers,

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.840
everybody's going to be tight unless they go through discord. Uh,

4
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.960
everybody's going to be talking through chat and it's a lot harder to the,

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.950
the gym of this game comes not from the game itself,

6
00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:18.120
but from the content surrounding the game. So the hilarious accusations,

7
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:21.360
the people turning like monopoly, like it's the ruiner of friends.

8
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.673
<v 1>So.</v>

9
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.170
<v 2>If that's your real name,</v>

10
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.520
are you Peter or are you an imposter?

11
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.053
<v 1>Oh, I don't know what you're talking.</v>

12
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.890
<v 2>I think you do. I think you're a sus.</v>

13
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.380
Okay. Who are you.

14
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.770
<v 1>And what have you done with, uh, the host Richard Garner?</v>

15
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.540
<v 2>So yes, for people at home and for you, it is your old power Richard here,</v>

16
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.590
but yes, that is among us lingo that we will be here.

17
00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:11.540
The cultural phenomenon that is sweeping the world by the millions

18
00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:13.100
and billions. Yeah.

19
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.510
<v 1>So I get it now, the wildly popular game among us is what you're talking about.</v>

20
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.820
A very popular among, among us. Yes.

21
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.280
<v 2>It is very popular among us.</v>

22
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.250
And so we wanted to take a deeper dive into this.

23
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:29.180
And obviously from the perspective of this particular show would have discussed.

24
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.220
What if among us was real? Oh, people will be very excited.

25
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.540
I think so. And, uh, but of course I'm not trying to fool anybody here.

26
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.220
I'm not the person to probably lead that charge or

27
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.850
answer those questions. You look like a Twitch gamer, nor are you.

28
00:01:46.851 --> 00:01:51.710
So that's why we bring in experts like Leanna Rupert from game

29
00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:55.640
informer. Thanks for making yourself AFK. And yes,

30
00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:59.630
I did live in that yesterday. Um, Leanna, how are you?

31
00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:01.070
Welcome to what if discussed?

32
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.450
<v 0>I am great. Thank you for having me. I'm excited to talk among us,</v>

33
00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:08.090
those suss little Ash, not jelly beans.

34
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.180
<v 2>I actually have in your, in your bio, uh,</v>

35
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.540
self self identified among us obsessive. And I didn't make,

36
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.110
that was actually your words, right?

37
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.280
<v 0>It is. I, uh, this game it's so crazy. This game, uh,</v>

38
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.820
has been out for a couple of years, but only hit popularity recently.

39
00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:27.890
And I totally fell off the map.

40
00:02:27.891 --> 00:02:32.330
I didn't hear about it until I started seeing it climb on Twitch and I checked

41
00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:36.380
it out and it's, it's the perfect game. It's, it's simple in a,

42
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.330
in an era where gaming is all overwhelming open worlds and it has

43
00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:43.370
to either be game of the year or nothing at all.

44
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:46.970
Like the simplicity of among us is refreshing.

45
00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:51.890
And I think what 2020 kind of needed, like we need just to relax and just chill.

46
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:56.810
And it also kind of gives us an outlet of rage because you literally just

47
00:02:56.811 --> 00:03:01.360
accuse each other and yell around the table. Somebody wins or somebody loses.

48
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.840
And that's a good outlet for just letting out some of the rage of whatever's

49
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:05.674
going on in the world.

50
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.340
<v 3>So it's a game that's being played by millions is being watched and streamed by</v>

51
00:03:11.341 --> 00:03:15.090
billions. Um, some of the most compelling Tik TOK content.

52
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.280
That's that's out there right now. And you mentioned it was launched in 2018.

53
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.550
Why do you think it's taken so long? And, uh, what,

54
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.300
why is it so popular right now? Basically just in the last month?

55
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.570
<v 0>Yeah, it's, uh, it's kind of crazy. Like,</v>

56
00:03:30.571 --> 00:03:35.100
I feel like the gaming industry as a whole has kind of reinvented how it

57
00:03:35.101 --> 00:03:38.820
approaches indie developers. Like I think eight years ago, I think,

58
00:03:38.821 --> 00:03:42.780
and these were like this notion, but no big websites,

59
00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:45.450
no big platforms were really devoting a lot of time to it.

60
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.950
And then we saw games like, uh, fall guys that kind of dominated,

61
00:03:49.951 --> 00:03:53.520
which is another game about jelly beans that came out.

62
00:03:53.521 --> 00:03:57.270
And I think over the last, I would say like 18, 19 months or so.

63
00:03:57.271 --> 00:04:01.560
And these have really been kind of revolutionized and given a pedestal,

64
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.810
which is deserved in the industry. Um, but yeah, at first I think personally,

65
00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:08.310
I mean, we saw a big jump in, uh,

66
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.950
on Twitch and that's where the popularity came from. You know, Twitch,

67
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.020
streamers influencers. They're really an official marketing arm now, uh,

68
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:19.110
for a lot of games. Um, I go to a lot of press events and things.

69
00:04:19.111 --> 00:04:22.350
And now at the ratio between journalists and influencers is,

70
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.360
is very up and down because that is, that's a big queue of marketing.

71
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.210
And so we saw like a lot of people on Twitch,

72
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.130
but then everybody's kind of attributing,

73
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.200
Twitch being the reason why it's so popular,

74
00:04:34.201 --> 00:04:38.310
but I don't think it would have even become a thing on Twitch if we didn't have

75
00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:40.380
the game by media tonic, which is fall guys,

76
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.060
which is a game that actually got rejected many times by publishers that they

77
00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:47.940
didn't think it would do well. And then the Twitter account,

78
00:04:47.941 --> 00:04:52.200
I think gained a million followers within less than a month, maybe two weeks,

79
00:04:52.201 --> 00:04:54.750
I think, and that came its own phenomenon,

80
00:04:54.751 --> 00:04:56.490
but it's the little jelly bean designed.

81
00:04:56.491 --> 00:04:59.670
So I think people were looking for that kind of a stylish ton of games.

82
00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:03.960
And that's when a few key gamers happened to stumble upon,

83
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.410
uh, you know, another little jelly bean, astronaut adventure with among us.

84
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.940
And it went from having a usual average concurrent player base of eight players

85
00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:15.930
worldwide to million of millions of players are now invested in this.

86
00:05:15.931 --> 00:05:20.580
And so that's kind of a nice little conjunction between Andy and

87
00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:24.570
relativity and the power of streamers. Hmm.

88
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.830
<v 2>I mean, it's an interesting thing and you, you referenced it, uh, you know,</v>

89
00:05:28.831 --> 00:05:31.890
the old, keep it simple, stupid or kiss, right. I mean,

90
00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:33.690
that's come up throughout, you know,

91
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.770
it sort of circles back throughout history where, when something blows up,

92
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.250
people often sort of resort back to, well, it just,

93
00:05:41.251 --> 00:05:45.210
it seemed to hit people in this area and this area and whatever it is,

94
00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:48.960
the product it blew up, it just sort of, you know, caught people by storm.

95
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.960
This is the case, but as it relates to gaming and you,

96
00:05:51.961 --> 00:05:56.760
you talked about it off the top complexity became the default, right? Just

97
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.760
ostentatious worlds, highly skilled,

98
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.680
highly talented players. And now you have something come along.

99
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:10.100
That's re I don't want to say it's, lo-fi certainly simpler,

100
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.760
but also more accessible because you don't have to be a fantastic gamer to play

101
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:14.594
this. Right?

102
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.110
<v 0>Yes. Uh, I think, uh, we kind of saw that with the big AOC stream,</v>

103
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.450
uh, lately was, uh.

104
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.640
<v 2>I saw, I watched that I was like, is AOC playing among us with,</v>

105
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.550
was it a Valkyrie or a Valkyrie or.

106
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.750
<v 0>Pokemon? I like a bunch of really big, uh, ma like it was,</v>

107
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.810
it was a crazy turnout and she does play games. Like,

108
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.590
I think she's a big league of legends fan, but she's not known as a gamer.

109
00:06:41.591 --> 00:06:46.120
She's not like, like some of us were, it's like our lives, I guess, Hopi

110
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.210
she's, she's a little busy, you know, she's a little busy, but yeah, no,

111
00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:56.590
I think it's very accessible. Um, you know, there's the little death animations,

112
00:06:56.591 --> 00:06:58.480
but it's nothing graphic other than,

113
00:06:58.481 --> 00:07:01.030
I guess the next snap would be kind of considered a little graphic,

114
00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:04.870
but the art style makes it accessible to all ages.

115
00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.520
You don't have to be a pro gamer to yell at somebody saying they look

116
00:07:09.521 --> 00:07:12.220
suspicious. Um, it it's,

117
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.750
it's almost funnier if you have inexperienced gamers on it because they don't

118
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.790
know kind of the talk and the lingo and that negativity kind of

119
00:07:21.791 --> 00:07:25.030
actually works in their favor. I remember my first match it ever did.

120
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.430
I never played the game. I didn't know how it worked.

121
00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:30.970
And I was imposter the first time. And I didn't know, you had to find task,

122
00:07:30.971 --> 00:07:34.330
pretend like you were doing them. I didn't know. So I kept asking a chat, like,

123
00:07:34.331 --> 00:07:38.350
what am I doing? Like work, where do I go? Do I go here? Do I go here?

124
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.610
And it kind of appealed to my teammates. Um,

125
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.810
natural wants to help me learn the game.

126
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.520
And it was the perfect cover stone when I saw that work and it was attentional.

127
00:07:51.521 --> 00:07:54.160
I wasn't being manipulative. I was genuinely so confused. I was like,

128
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:58.360
wait that word, I could use that going forward. So if you ever play with me,

129
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.640
I just told myself that, I guess.

130
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.310
<v 2>Well, the big, uh, the big,</v>

131
00:08:03.311 --> 00:08:08.080
what if for us today is what if among us was real,

132
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:11.950
but, uh, it seems like we may be a little late to the party or the parties.

133
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.110
<v 0>I think it's a little crazy. I mean, there, there,</v>

134
00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.670
there was a fan that created like a FIAR version of,

135
00:08:21.671 --> 00:08:25.630
among us that kind of makes it a little bit easier. Oh, that's interesting.

136
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:30.580
Yeah. Uh, that was really awesomely made. Um,

137
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:34.000
it was really well done and it kind of does put you in that mindset of like,

138
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:38.170
what if I was just doing random tasks and electrical and somebody just a friend

139
00:08:38.171 --> 00:08:40.000
just came up and killed me. Like,

140
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.750
I don't think we could ever be walking jelly beans, but you know, it's,

141
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.580
I don't think it's implausible.

142
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.720
These are all self-contained maps of being on a spaceship and

143
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.310
oxygen eyes and everything. I don't think it's that far fetched.

144
00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:55.830
I don't know why would want to do.

145
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.340
<v 2>A bit of a reboot of like, you know, like, you know,</v>

146
00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:01.830
it's like everything old is new again. So there's, you know,

147
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:06.390
that sort of a mystery dinner, theater clue, you know, wink murder,

148
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:10.220
like who's, you know, who's, who's lying basically who, who,

149
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.440
who killed people, who's lying and,

150
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.570
and the rest of the group trying to figure it out, right? Like, it's,

151
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.480
there's a lot of different. I,

152
00:09:17.481 --> 00:09:22.290
I play a little poker and that's obviously for the kids at home because I

153
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:26.820
play a lot of poker, but it's interesting because again,

154
00:09:26.821 --> 00:09:31.020
when you start to zoom out and look at where are the commonalities in human

155
00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:33.780
behavior that when something goes massive,

156
00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:37.830
you have to start to look at what is the, what is the common denominator? And,

157
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:38.341
you know,

158
00:09:38.341 --> 00:09:43.140
if I was looking at it from a poker lens and I was thinking that there's two

159
00:09:43.141 --> 00:09:46.860
different types of experiences for poker, like, there's the, you know,

160
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:51.240
there's the, the home game with your buddies. And that's a really, you know,

161
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:54.990
that's, that's more social and more fun. Right. But also,

162
00:09:54.991 --> 00:09:59.430
what is your friends easier to know when they're full of it? Right? Like,

163
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.740
not always, but if you've known somebody for 20 years and you know, their moves,

164
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.820
right. You know, their tells if you will, like Leanne is a yes,

165
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.110
but her sort of, Oh my God, I know what I'm doing. If yeah,

166
00:10:13.111 --> 00:10:16.410
I got friends if they were doing that right away or the imposter. And,

167
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:21.120
but also what I've noticed is it's an entirely different experience when I

168
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:23.010
play with strangers friends, you know,

169
00:10:23.011 --> 00:10:27.450
if you're in Vegas or at a casino and I enjoy both for different

170
00:10:27.451 --> 00:10:29.940
reasons, what for you do you think is,

171
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:33.450
is maybe the optimum and maybe it's a personal choice, um,

172
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:36.630
to way optimum way to play among us.

173
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.390
Is it with friends or with people you don't know?

174
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.790
<v 0>Definitely better with friends. Cause if you're not playing, if you,</v>

175
00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:47.900
if you play with stray, the difference is, is, is in the communication methods.

176
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:49.520
If you play with strangers,

177
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.430
everybody's going to be tight unless they go through discord. Uh,

178
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:56.940
everybody's going to be talking through chat and it's a lot harder to the, the,

179
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:59.960
the gym of this game comes not from the game itself,

180
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:04.130
but from the content surrounding the game. So the hilarious accusations,

181
00:11:04.131 --> 00:11:07.970
the people turning like monopoly, like it's the ruiner of friendships. This.

182
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:08.803
<v 2>Is the new rules.</v>

183
00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.170
<v 0>This is, this is the new halo,</v>

184
00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:14.600
multiplayer where your friendships will be tested.

185
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.700
<v 2>You just reminded me, honestly, like of,</v>

186
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:21.590
of really like absolutely wildly intense board throwing

187
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:26.060
piece, throwing fi family fights monopoly back in the day.

188
00:11:26.061 --> 00:11:28.790
Like it was crazy. It is like the absolute.

189
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:34.070
And I'm guessing in this because I have Watson videos. Like people do go nuts.

190
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.970
<v 0>They, yeah, they it's, it's so funny. We were playing a match.</v>

191
00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.550
We're actually going to be playing again this weekend. Uh,

192
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:44.110
but we were playing a match with a couple of the game informer folks and some of

193
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.840
the people from the Washington post. And, and it's so funny because in public,

194
00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:52.760
cause we're all journalists, we're very like, well, they are I'm, I'm not I,

195
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.780
but they're very professional and put together and just, you know,

196
00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:58.780
how do you do? And then where do we go in this among us?

197
00:11:58.781 --> 00:12:01.990
And it's just masks off claws out

198
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.770
and just like, no, just shut your mouth.

199
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.070
Everything like ambitions,

200
00:12:09.071 --> 00:12:13.780
go to the wind because nothing matters when it comes to proving that you're

201
00:12:13.781 --> 00:12:17.140
not sus you're not the imposter, even if you are.

202
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.070
And then you've got the other mechanics of which I learned actually this weekend

203
00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:25.780
for the first time is the third imposter of if a person is not the

204
00:12:25.781 --> 00:12:27.760
imposter, but they suspect you is,

205
00:12:27.761 --> 00:12:31.900
but they want to help them for some reason that they will purposely misdirect

206
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.160
and blame other people. I don't understand why that's a thing.

207
00:12:36.161 --> 00:12:39.190
I don't understand, um, what benefit there is to that.

208
00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:42.910
But I've been accused of that a lot because I apparently I have no intuition

209
00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.750
when I think I caught somebody. I'm like, they're acting really suspicious.

210
00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.520
I'm nine times out of 10 wrong.

211
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.870
So I've been accused of being a third imposter a lot. It's like, no,

212
00:12:52.871 --> 00:12:54.520
I'm just dumb. I guess.

213
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.530
<v 3>Ecological profile machine. It sounds like. Well.</v>

214
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:00.630
<v 0>Leanna.</v>

215
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.960
<v 3>It's interesting because I think what the world would least need at this point</v>

216
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:08.070
is, is a game that divides us into factions creates liars,

217
00:13:08.071 --> 00:13:11.250
creates Meyers. Yeah. This is not something that's, uh,

218
00:13:11.251 --> 00:13:14.220
that we're really should be looking for at this time set.

219
00:13:14.221 --> 00:13:17.520
I guess also I guess the glass half full rage outlet.

220
00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.750
<v 0>Rage outlet, you get all of that out. You got issues with somebody,</v>

221
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:23.790
but in among us.

222
00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.880
<v 3>We'd love it. If you could stick around for a few more questions, if you can.</v>

223
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:28.561
Absolutely perfect.

224
00:13:28.561 --> 00:13:32.670
Where can people find and follow you and read your reviews of, uh,

225
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.050
among us and other games?

226
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.700
<v 0>Uh, you can find me@gameinformer.com. Um,</v>

227
00:13:38.701 --> 00:13:42.070
my social information is on there as well. Please. Don't make fun of me.

228
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:46.980
Every my tag for everything is there's an old gamer tag joke.

229
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:48.780
It's dirty F and hippie.

230
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.040
<v 3>I'm glad you brought that up because I want to know what the source of that was.</v>

231
00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.340
<v 0>Uh, when I was active duty, um,</v>

232
00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.480
everybody in my unit made fun of me because I always, no matter where we were,

233
00:14:00.481 --> 00:14:04.410
if we were in the middle East or if I was on a ship, they, Oh,

234
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.220
I always had my guitar. And basically that, that, that, uh, I was a sailor,

235
00:14:08.221 --> 00:14:10.680
but I went great sign to the brains, but I was basically the one that's like,

236
00:14:10.681 --> 00:14:15.030
so anyway, here's wonder wall. I remember when we were in the middle East,

237
00:14:15.031 --> 00:14:18.570
I was like sweat, you know, you're wearing a hundred plus pounds of,

238
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.590
of equipment. It's really hot. I was really sweaty. I was really gross. Like,

239
00:14:22.591 --> 00:14:26.790
it was just like, sweat was just hair. It was like plastered. And I was like,

240
00:14:26.791 --> 00:14:29.280
yo. So anyway, I started playing there, like, man,

241
00:14:29.281 --> 00:14:33.720
she's such like a dirty hippie. And I was like, you know what?

242
00:14:33.721 --> 00:14:37.110
I like it let's do it. Like, you can't really insult me if you insult me,

243
00:14:37.111 --> 00:14:40.440
I just kind of adapt it. So I was like, yeah, I'm dirty up and hit me.

244
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:41.910
And it just kind of started.

245
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:46.620
<v 3>Yeah. I, I, I, I just love the idea of somebody in like, sort of, you know,</v>

246
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.200
full military, you know, Yama one.

247
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:51.860
That's all I can play on guitar too.

248
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:57.050
<v 2>Yeah. Okay. Great stuff. Uh, we'll be back with, uh, Leanna Rupert, uh,</v>

249
00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.340
after the break. Um, and if you want to listen,

250
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:05.030

<v 3>We'll hear more from Leanna. We're going to check in with her.</v>

253
00:15:09.401 --> 00:15:13.240
On the other side, if you're watching the video podcast on YouTube,

254
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.540
then you're gonna want to click the link for the extended audio podcast below.

255
00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:19.720
We're going to dive in more about the company behind, among us, uh,

256
00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.260
inner sloths and the possibility of SQL to the game. Um,

257
00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.320
but if that's all the time you have for us, thanks for coming out, then.

258
00:15:26.321 --> 00:15:27.880
Thanks for watching. What if discussion.

259
00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:33.640
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>
