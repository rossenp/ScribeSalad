00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.200
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.510
<v 1>The sun's core is shrinking,</v>

3
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.420
but as its core shrinks,

4
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.520
the sun itself grows larger and it will continue to

5
00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:24.380
grow until one day it engulfs the

6
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.100
earth. How long can you survive?

7
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.720
<v 0>What will happen to the oceans.</v>

8
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.830
<v 1>And will other planets be affected?</v>

9
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.830
This is what if,

10
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.820
and here's what would happen if the sun swallowed the earth

11
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.390
every 1 billion years, the sun becomes 10% hotter,

12
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.640
but you're on what if we're going to take billions of years and condense the

13
00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:57.260
action into one month,

14
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.000
get ready because we're going to be moving really fast this time.

15
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.480
Instead of 1 billion years,

16
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.850
it would only take four days for the sun to become 10% hotter.

17
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.590
This means you'll see the earth in Gulf, by the sun in just one month.

18
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.130
That is if you're still around to witness the final.

19
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.413
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

20
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.710
<v 1>Day one,</v>

21
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.030
you'd be blissfully unaware of the tragedy about to befall earth.

22
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.210
Maybe it's a little hotter, but that's just weather.

23
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.463
<v 0>It happens.</v>

24
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.580
<v 1>By day four space agencies across the globe would be sounding the alarm</v>

25
00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:46.520
bells. By this time,

26
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.570
the sun would be about 10% brighter and hotter.

27
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.000
<v 0>And.</v>

28
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.970
<v 1>While 10% doesn't sound like a lot,</v>

29
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.750
it will be the beginning of the end for us.

30
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.930
As the sun heats up more and more water from earth surface will

31
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.880
evaporate into the atmosphere.

32
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.710
This will increase the greenhouse gas effect causing global temperatures to

33
00:02:12.711 --> 00:02:13.544
skyrocket.

34
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.100
All of a sudden it will become very humid and very

35
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.940
The sun's high energy light would bombard the atmosphere.

36
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.660
Splitting those water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.

37
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.210
<v 0>Earth.</v>

38
00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.470
<v 1>Will begin to lose its water and you won't be able to escape the lethal</v>

39
00:02:36.471 --> 00:02:38.600
radiation on earth surface.

40
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.150
<v 0>If.</v>

41
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.300
<v 1>You want to survive, you'll have to go deep, underground.</v>

42
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.060
<v 0>But.</v>

43
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.350
<v 1>Even under a protective layer of earth soil, you won't be safe for long</v>

44
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.000
By day 16, the sun would be almost 40%.

45
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.050
Our planet's oceans will boil and there won't be any moisture left in the

46
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:05.884
atmosphere.

47
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.590
<v 0>The beautiful.</v>

48
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.240
<v 1>Lush earth that you grew up on will become a hot dry barren.</v>

49
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.910
<v 0>Around.</v>

50
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.240
<v 1>Day 20, the sun would run out of hydrogen.</v>

51
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.020
So instead it will start to burn helium in its core.

52
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.040
The sun is now a red giant star and would expand rapidly

53
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.750
while losing its mass.

54
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.600
The sun's gravitational pull on earth would be weakened and our planet

55
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.630
would begin to drift away from the expanding sun,

56
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.840
but not far enough.

57
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:48.270
<v 0>According.</v>

58
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.540
<v 1>To researchers, Klaus, Peter Schroeder and Robert C. Smith,</v>

59
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.850
the earth would only have moved about

60
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.140
0.0002. Astronomical units.

61
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.210
An astronomical unit is the distance between earth and the sun.

62
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.500
While earth is moving away from the encroaching sun,

63
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.480
the red giant would grow up to 1.2 astronomical units in

64
00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:13.314
radius.

65
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:15.360
<v 0>The sun.</v>

66
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.100
<v 1>Would be larger than Earth's orbit. It would swallow the planet home.</v>

67
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.630
<v 0>One second.</v>

68
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.400
<v 1>It's inside the sun's atmosphere.</v>

69
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.360
Earth would collide with particles of gas and spiral inward

70
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.600
and earth.

71
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.310
Wouldn't be the only casualty of the expanding sun mercury and

72
00:04:38.311 --> 00:04:39.240
Venus would be.

73
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.410
<v 0>The rings of Saturn would melt.</v>

74
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.780
Pluto would become much warmer. And if there.

75
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.110
<v 1>Is a liquid surface and a thick atmosphere on this distant dwarf planet,</v>

76
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.850
it might even become in-house.

77
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.073
<v 0>Beautiful.</v>

78
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.713
<v 1>Unfortunately,</v>

79
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.100
30 days doesn't give the human race enough time to prepare for such a category.

80
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.233
<v 0>Event.</v>

81
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.540
<v 1>If we had more time, like billions of years worth,</v>

82
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.630
we could come up with an evacuation plan.

83
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.230
<v 0>But that's a story for another. What is.</v>
