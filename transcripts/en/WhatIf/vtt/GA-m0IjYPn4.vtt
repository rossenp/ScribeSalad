00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.140
<v 1>History.</v>

3
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.060
There have been many incredible civilizations that have shaped the way we

4
00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:17.870
live today. One was ancient Rome,

5
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.600
a once majestic and thriving city whose strong foundations live on today.

6
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.040
<v 0>This day yet, despite all its grand jury life.</v>

7
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.930
<v 1>As an average citizen in ancient Rome was hard and unforgiving.</v>

8
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.370
What strange customs did the Romans have?

9
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.410
<v 0>What was the.</v>

10
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.050
<v 1>Life expectancy of an average citizen?</v>

11
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.210
<v 0>And.</v>

12
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.310
<v 1>What did the Romans do for fun?</v>

13
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.820
This is what if and here's what would happen if you lived in

14
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.900
ancient Rome?

15
00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.230
Let's imagine you woke up sometime between 27 BCE

16
00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:04.520
and one 80 CE the golden age of Rome

17
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.430
known in Latin by the Romans as PAX Romana or Roman

18
00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:15.050
peace. This Epic began when Augustus came into power.

19
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.400
After his father,

20
00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:21.050
the infamous Julius Caesar was assassinated with a

21
00:01:21.051 --> 00:01:22.220
Gustus on the throne.

22
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.990
Rome began a period of rapid development at its peak.

23
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.240
It was home to over 1 million people.

24
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.850
It was a truly golden era of architecture, science, art,

25
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.550
entertainment, and economic growth.

26
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.860
It was a time of peace and prosperity. If you are rich then.

27
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.170
Okay. So what's the catch. Well,

28
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.180
unless you were part of the 1% that controlled 16% of Rome's

29
00:01:53.181 --> 00:01:57.680
wealth life was tough as a citizen up to

30
00:01:57.681 --> 00:02:02.360
50% of all Roman children died before the age of 10 and

31
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.380
most adults were lucky if they lived long enough to see their fifties,

32
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.540
even though things were peaceful,

33
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.810
battles still happened and soldiers were in demand.

34
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.360
Roman armies at this point were largely made up of volunteers who were hoping

35
00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:19.130
for a better chance at life.

36
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.470
Most soldiers came from the poorest social class and were stationed at the

37
00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:28.010
borders of the empire where the most trouble was expected.

38
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.510
As a soldier,

39
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.500
you were able to settle in the land where you were stationed once you've

40
00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:38.450
retired. And if you were particularly good with a sword or a boat,

41
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.670
you might be handpicked to join the special forces designed to protect the

42
00:02:43.671 --> 00:02:48.080
emperor, or maybe to climb the ranks as a gladiator.

43
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.490
They were treated like celebrities. Well,

44
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.470
at least the ones that survived with a large portion of the men

45
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.200
away from home working as women gained more autonomy during this

46
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:06.640
period, serving important roles as city counselors, lawyers,

47
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.480
teachers, and more, some women were even gladiators.

48
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.340
However,

49
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.210
the men in the family still had the privilege of handling the matters of

50
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:17.710
property and finance.

51
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.000
Most of the poor lived in cheap wooden houses.

52
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.050
Many of them lived in the city, slums where crime was rampant.

53
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.210
You might find the emperor Augustus's police force or cohort days urban,

54
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:33.310
a patrolling some parts of the city.

55
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:37.840
But generally the poorer areas were lawless and dangerous.

56
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.510
Whether you were a soldier,

57
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.230
philosopher or Senator most Romans eight,

58
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.150
a similar diet of bread, cheese, grapes, nuts, olives, and meat.

59
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.310
If you could afford it,

60
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.350
you could eat out at one of the many bakeries in the city to wash things

61
00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:59.050
down. You'd have the option of thick milk,

62
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.520
watered wine or fruit juice. That doesn't sound too bad to me.

63
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.620
After lunch, many Romans went to the bathhouse to swim, play sports,

64
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.660
bathe or get a massage.

65
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.090
And dinner was just a few hours later around four or 5:00 PM in the afternoon.

66
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.790
Okay. Where do I sign up? While many Romans had this luxury,

67
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.270
a large portion of them were slaves or clients for rich families

68
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.060
in this patron client system,

69
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.040
people were sold and forced to help with all kinds of work from hard

70
00:04:35.041 --> 00:04:39.480
menial labor to highly skilled jobs like teachers, accountants,

71
00:04:39.481 --> 00:04:42.030
and doctors. If they were lucky,

72
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.140
their patrons would give them a good dinner and they would go home with pockets

73
00:04:46.141 --> 00:04:51.120
full of food. And if they did really well, they would eventually be freed.

74
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.160
Some poor people were desperate enough to sell their children in times of

75
00:04:56.161 --> 00:05:01.020
hardship. Speaking of hardship, if you needed to use the washroom,

76
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.690
you could visit one of Rome's public toilets,

77
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.330
housing over 10 toilet seats out in the open that's

78
00:05:09.331 --> 00:05:13.350
intimate. These weren't exactly the cleanest toilets.

79
00:05:13.351 --> 00:05:15.270
And instead of toilet paper,

80
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.380
Romans had a stick with a sponge at the end that they would share,

81
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.000
eh, I'll stick with my day, please.

82
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.790
And when it was time to clean up,

83
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.590
many Romans used urine from humans or animals to

84
00:05:31.591 --> 00:05:34.500
decontaminate surfaces, treat infections,

85
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:38.700
and even to wash their laundry, it might sound strange,

86
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.480
but urea in urine breaks down into ammonia,

87
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.650
a strong cleaning agent found in most cleaning supplies today.

88
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.180
And if you happened to get sick with epilepsy,

89
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.890
you might be scribe some gladiators, blood or liver to consume.

90
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.240
Uh, thanks. But no thanks doc.

91
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.150
If you manage to save up a little money,

92
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.000
you could go shopping at the Trajan's market,

93
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.030
the first ever mall in the world,

94
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.060
or if you were craving more excitement.

95
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.080
How about a chariot race at the circus Maximus or an Epic

96
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.850
gladiator battle, maybe some theater and for the budget minded,

97
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.910
there were plenty of public executions to go around.

98
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.290
But if history is your entertainment of choice,

99
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.610
have you ever wondered what the world would be like if Christopher Columbus

100
00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:38.690
never discovered America? Well,

101
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.040
that sounds like a story for another. What if.
