<v 1>An asteroid racist toward earth. It's big, it's fast.</v>

3
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.520
And it's about to do a lot of damage,

4
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.280
but we're not just going to sit around and wait for the end of days,

5
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.560
we're going to fight back

6
00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.430
What would happen if we nuked to an astroid,

7
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.870
would it save humanity or make things worse?

8
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.620
How does a nuclear blast in space compared to a blast on earth

9
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.940
and would our nukes even be strong enough to destroy it?

10
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.040
This is what if,

11
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.790
and here's what would happen if we nuked an astroid

12
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.020
in the year 2,175,

13
00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.410
the asteroid Benu will pass by earth.

14
00:01:00.411 --> 00:01:04.970
And there's a one in 2,700 chance that it will hit us.

15
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.200
If those sound like good odds to you think again,

16
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.440
Benu is taller than the empire state building.

17
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.790
And it's 15 times heavier than the great pyramid of Giza.

18
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.130
And if it hit the earth,

19
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.990
it would release as much energy as 23 SAR Bombus,

20
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.320
which is the largest hydrogen bomb ever exploded.

21
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.060
Do you still like those odds? I'd like them a little more.

22
00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:36.020
If we had a contingency plan for NASA,

23
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.150
that's the hyper velocity asteroid mitigation mission for emergency response,

24
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.340
also known as hammer and just like its name suggests the

25
00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:51.020
plan is to Ram into an incoming asteroid or to detonate a nuke that will

26
00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:55.970
send it off course, but will it be enough?

27
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.470
And what sort of repercussions could we expect?

28
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.130
The sooner we discover an asteroid heading our way, the safer we'll be.

29
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.440
For example, if we detected an incoming asteroid a year in advance,

30
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.120
we'd only have to change its course by a few centimeters to keep it from hitting

31
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.110
earth to do this, we could detonate a nuclear bomb,

32
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.970
a few hundred meters away from the asteroid causing it to change its course and

33
00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:29.780
move away from earth. And if that didn't work,

34
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.490
we could just crash into the asteroid with the most powerful bomb we've got.

35
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.750
But if anything were to malfunction before the bomb reached the asteroid,

36
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.090
the resulting consequences might even be worse than the asteroid hitting earth.

37
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.540
But once the nuke was in space,

38
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.550
the world's population would be relatively safe with no atmosphere out

39
00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:58.730
there only vacuum the blast would disappear,

40
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.420
but the radiation would be much stronger while people on earth would be

41
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:05.254
safe.

42
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.210
Anyone in any nearby spaceships would be risking their lives in

43
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:13.630
the interest of preventing as many casualties as possible.

44
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.850
This would have to be an automated mission and assuming that nothing goes

45
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:22.450
wrong and there isn't some kind of AI mutiny,

46
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.790
we could very well succeed in pushing an astroid off course,

47
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.150
as long as it wasn't too big,

48
00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.660
a bigger asteroid would require bolder tactics, such as dark,

49
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.100
dark stands for double asteroid redirection test

50
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.040
NASA plans to slam into an asteroid in 2022 to change its orbit,

51
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.360
the impact would be equal to three tons of TNT.

52
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.790
This mission could result in the first ever manmade meteorite shower.

53
00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.560
And if it works,

54
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.420
it will serve as a blueprint of how we could respond to asteroid threats in the

55
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:08.230
future. Of course, when it comes to destroying Benu,

56
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.690
the bomb will use will be at least a million times stronger than what dark would

57
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:16.660
be packing. And yes,

58
00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:19.360
we've got nukes that are that powerful.

59
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.910
The only thing we'd have to look out for after blowing up a giant asteroid is

60
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:25.744
space debris.

61
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.690
The debris could severely damage our satellites and endanger any astronauts

62
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:33.550
aboard the international space station.

63
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.570
And if any larger chunks of the asteroid found their way down to earth,

64
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.800
they could create craters up to 20 times their size

65
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.690
On the bright side, if the nuke exploded close enough to earth,

66
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.610
the radiation that admits would be distorted by our planet's magnetic field,

67
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.600
which would probably be the prettiest light show ever.

68
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.840
Or if you don't want to wait for a doomsday scenario,

69
00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:10.170
you could just take a trip up North to see the Northern lights.

70
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.080
It's crazy to think that nuking asteroids is a potential survival plan

71
00:05:16.081 --> 00:05:20.220
for humanity, but considering it's us against well,

72
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.290
pretty much anything in the infinite void of space we have to make do with what

73
00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:26.124
we have.
