00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.550
<v 0>This gigantic bat was.</v>

2
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.350
<v 1>Captured on camera by a man filming his camping trip.</v>

3
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.840
<v 0>He's been missing ever since.</v>

4
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.930
<v 1>Stories like these have been swirling the internet for the past couple of years,</v>

5
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.180
with people using pictures and videos to supposedly prove that

6
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.970
human sized bats exist,

7
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.440
but could bats really get that big?

8
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.470
How dangerous would they be?

9
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.870
And why could we make lots of money off their

10
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.280
giant bat poop? This is what if,

11
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.990
and here's what would happen if bats were the size of humans,

12
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.150
bats a whole ready creep a lot of people out.

13
00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:04.100
So imagine how scared people would be if there were giant ones

14
00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:09.020
roaming around and keep in mind that bats usually live

15
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:13.070
together in groups of 100 to several thousand.

16
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.900
So if you run into one of these giant beasts, chances are,

17
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.510
there'd be a whole army of them nearby.

18
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.820
Would their natural ecosystems be able to sustain these oversized

19
00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:26.654
bats?

20
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.000
To understand what a world with giant bats would be like?

21
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.810
Let's get to know our regular sized bats first,

22
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.410
because there are so many different bat species today.

23
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.730
We're just going to focus on to the flying Fox and the

24
00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:47.720
vampire bat,

25
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.480
vampire bats have a wingspan of 35 to 40

26
00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:54.314
centimeters.

27
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.580
They can run speeds of up to 1.2 meters per second,

28
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.490
and they really like to drink blood.

29
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.310
They drink so much of it that they can double their weight in just one

30
00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:08.144
feeding.

31
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.160
So can you imagine how bloodthirsty they'd be if they were the size of

32
00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:13.994
humans?

33
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.760
Luckily for us bats don't get any bigger than our next

34
00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:21.680
featured player. The flying Fox,

35
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.320
there are 60 flying Fox species and the largest one has a

36
00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:30.230
wingspan of 1.7 meters.

37
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.790
That might sound like it's getting almost human sized,

38
00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:39.620
but the body is pretty smart. About 37 meters in length.

39
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.420
They have a surprisingly big brain for such a small body,

40
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.500
and they're said to be as intelligent as dogs.

41
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.350
So what would life be like if there were millions of human

42
00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:59.200
sized, intelligent blood sucking bats roaming around? Well,

43
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.100
let's find.

44
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.933
<v 0>Out.</v>

45
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.390
<v 1>Flying Fox bats would need to be six times bigger to become the size of a</v>

46
00:03:09.391 --> 00:03:10.224
human.

47
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.270
There are new head to toe length would be 170 centimeters.

48
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.610
Their new wingspan would be 10 meters and their

49
00:03:20.611 --> 00:03:24.810
new weight would be 216 kilograms.

50
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.200
They would need to eat about 19 kilograms of fruit every

51
00:03:31.201 --> 00:03:35.370
day, just to sustain themselves with this new hunger,

52
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.470
they would easily wipe out farms and orchards and they disrupt the

53
00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:41.610
entire food chain.

54
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.950
And then there's the vampire bat. Don't worry.

55
00:03:46.951 --> 00:03:51.420
They won't add any more stress to our fruit farms because they're only hungry

56
00:03:51.421 --> 00:03:54.180
for blood. Oh, wait. That sounds even worse.

57
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.970
Human sized vampire bats would be about 170 centimeters long.

58
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.520
They'd have a wingspan of 6.8 meters and a mask of

59
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.020
295 kilograms because of their size.

60
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.240
They would be able to drink 34 liters of blood per meal.

61
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.880
If we want to save our necks,

62
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.100
we might need to raise livestock to offer up to the vampire bats.

63
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.640
We just wouldn't be able to use them for food after,

64
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:31.410
because the vampire bats would probably infect that livestock

65
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.520
with rabies.

66
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.500
And we wouldn't only have to worry about feeding these big beasts.

67
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.040
We'd also have to worry about where they're going to live.

68
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.410
Usually that's live in groups of a few hundred to a few thousand in

69
00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:53.190
caves, hollow trees, addicts, and barns,

70
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.680
clearly human sized bats.

71
00:04:55.681 --> 00:04:58.440
Wouldn't all fit into the same amount of space anymore.

72
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.720
They might need to create smaller groups, take over buildings and parks,

73
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.720
their sheer size food requirements and bodily functions could

74
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.470
damage their new homes. But on the bright side,

75
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.940
their bodily functions could also make you rich.

76
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.740
That excrement also known as guano is an effective fertilizer.

77
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.940
It has high amounts of nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium,

78
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.430
and it can be very expensive right now.

79
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.830
An average bat only releases about two and a half grams of guano each

80
00:05:37.831 --> 00:05:42.240
year. But with these new human sized bats,

81
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.210
eating upwards of 19 kilograms every day,

82
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.990
their guano production will increase dramatically.

83
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:55.290
So if you're brave enough to get near these beastly creatures to

84
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.070
collect their poop, you could make a lot of money.

85
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.360
<v 0>All you'd have to do next is figure out how to spend it,</v>

86
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.670
but that's a story for another, whatever.
