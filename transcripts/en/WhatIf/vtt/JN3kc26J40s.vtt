00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:01.921
<v 0>Deep frying,</v>

2
00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:06.270
a Turkey can oftentimes be incredibly dangerous.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.040
So why don't we try a different cooking method?

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.160
Let's send our Turkey up into space and have it

5
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:20.070
come to earth while moving at the speed of light.

6
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.370
Do you think this would be any safer?

7
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.300
How fast is the speed of light?

8
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.880
Could a Turkey moving this fast damage the earth

9
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.700
and what would happen once it reaches our atmosphere?

10
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.530
This is what if, and here's what would happen.

11
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.890
If a Turkey hit the earth at the speed of light,

12
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.100
the speed of light is nearly 300,000 kilometers per second.

13
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.250
If an object we're going this fast,

14
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.290
it could circle the earth seven and a half times in just a single

15
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:02.124
second.

16
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.780
So what would happen if we made a Turkey move this fast

17
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.570
and then hurled it toward our planet

18
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.110
before we go any further,

19
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:17.910
we should let you know that it's impossible for an object to move at the speed

20
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:22.320
of light that's because the faster an object moves,

21
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.640
the more it's mass increases and it's length contracts.

22
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.750
In other words, when our Turkey is moving at the speed of light,

23
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.430
it would have an infinite mass and a length of zero,

24
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.110
which is impossible, but we won't let our fun stuff there.

25
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.510
Instead, we're going to have our Turkey move at 99.99%.

26
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.930
The speed of life, suck on that Einstein.

27
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.880
And now moving at this speed in space,

28
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.640
the Turkey is coming from earth,

29
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.010
but before it even hits our planet,

30
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.060
we've noticed some of the effects long before it impacts

31
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.350
as the Turkey is moving through Earth's atmosphere.

32
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.010
It would start to slam into atmospheric particles.

33
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.950
Since it's moving at such a high speed,

34
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.860
the Turkey would begin to get ripped apart.

35
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.980
If you wanted to look up in the sky,

36
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.830
you'd see bright explosions in our atmosphere,

37
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.560
but the volume of the explosions would probably make you instinctively

38
00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:35.460
run for cover and hide. This might not.

39
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.830
<v 1>You sound all that terrible,</v>

40
00:02:36.831 --> 00:02:41.270
but it would still cause massive destruction on earth surface,

41
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.070
the closest modern equivalent to something like this would be the

42
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.280
Chelyabinsk meteor in 2013,

43
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.530
that meteor exploded at a height of 23.3 kilometers.

44
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.150
And when that happened,

45
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.390
it resulted in 1000 people getting injured and huge amounts

46
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:04.360
of property damage. Our Turkey.

47
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.450
<v 0>Moving at the speed of light would be equal to 40,000 of those meteors</v>

48
00:03:09.451 --> 00:03:14.430
hitting earth. And these explosions wouldn't happen all at once,

49
00:03:14.431 --> 00:03:15.750
but sporadically,

50
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.590
as it moves through the atmosphere as they happen there,

51
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.120
shockwaves would cause buildings and windows to be completely destroyed.

52
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.720
And if this were to happen,

53
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.930
it would be the earth best case scenario.

54
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.700
That's because this Turkey hasn't even hit the planet yet,

55
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.150
but if it did come right for us,

56
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.210
then the results would be even worse

57
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.630
due to all the energy behind it.

58
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.010
If the Turkey hit New York city at 99.9,

59
00:03:50.011 --> 00:03:51.930
9% of the speed of light,

60
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.250
it would be like dropping 400 nuclear bombs.

61
00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.490
This would completely destroy the city,

62
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.310
not dimension parts of the planet itself.

63
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.500
The impact from this massive explosion could destroy the Earth's

64
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.910
crust causing magma to spew up and fill the

65
00:04:11.911 --> 00:04:12.744
streets.

66
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.130
Massive fires would start and millions of people would die,

67
00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.440
but ground zero wouldn't be the only place heavily affected

68
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.570
an impact earth.

69
00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:29.310
Like this could cause earthquakes and fires all across North

70
00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:30.144
America.

71
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.490
An entire half of the world would be completely destroyed just from a

72
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:36.600
harmless Turkey.

73
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.050
<v 1>So the speed of light can be pretty dangerous.</v>

74
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.690
But what might happen if you rode your bike at this speed?

75
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.850
Well, we'll leave that story for another.

76
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.500
What if cool. Yeah. And happy Thanksgiving.
