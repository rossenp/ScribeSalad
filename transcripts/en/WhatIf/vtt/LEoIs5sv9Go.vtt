1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.520
<v 0>It's a three-dimensional hole. And one of,</v>

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.240
one of my gripes that I have sometimes with how these sorts of things are

3
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:08.640
portrayed in movies and stuff,

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.480
is they tend to think of it as like a circle.

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.330
And then you sort of fall in and you go somewhere,

6
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.010
but where it's more of a sphere,

7
00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:19.200
you can approach it from many different directions.

8
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.350
So the other side is sort of a weird thing to think about because it isn't,

9
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.101
you don't mean,

10
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:27.420
I think the other side so much as you mean the other place it may go to.

11
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.963
<v 1>So Pete.</v>

12
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.780
<v 2>No. Are you into the show? Yes, I'm very well. Every week. I'm the same really?</v>

13
00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:47.870
I know I should, I should start differently. Okay. I'll start different. Okay.

14
00:00:47.871 --> 00:00:52.820
So how are your eyes? My eyes, um, just like the year 20,

15
00:00:52.821 --> 00:00:54.530
20, Whoa, gentlemen,

16
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.180
Peter Smeaton dropping the comedy. I would say,

17
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.800
unfortunately that my eyes are also like the year 2020 getting

18
00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:08.420
worse. It seems every month, as you, as people at home can tell, I do,

19
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.550
I do wear glasses are near-sighted.

20
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.630
You can see very well and always have been able to. Right.

21
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.220
I can see a lot of things. I am, I can see everything far away.

22
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.960
I can see through a lot of things like, uh, your, uh, cheesy openings,

23
00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:28.370
but one thing, one thing I can't see through, what do you think black hole?

24
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.260
Exactly. Well, I mean, by definition, very difficult to see through right. Uh,

25
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.740
black they're they're they're large. They're, you know, it's a, it's a,

26
00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:41.180
it's a massive, well, a massive mass that really,

27
00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:45.530
I think only theoretically people believe we could see through, but again,

28
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.470
all due respect to you all due respect to me,

29
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.960
we're not the people who are going to be able to answer that. I know.

30
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.210
So that's why we have experts on the show.

31
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.720
And today we do have an expert from the university of Southern California,

32
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.710
a professor from the physics and astronomy department. You know him,

33
00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:03.980
you love him. He's a friend of the show professor Clifford Johnson.

34
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:06.440
Welcome back. Welcome back to what if discussed?

35
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.810
<v 0>Hi, how are you? Okay, good.</v>

36
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.020
<v 2>Well, we're good. We're, we're kind of debating. Uh, well,</v>

37
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.230
I don't know if we're debating, but we're trying to figure out, you know,

38
00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:17.690
if I was debating, could you see through a black hole?

39
00:02:17.691 --> 00:02:22.040
And obviously this is theoretical. So, you know, this is,

40
00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:26.360
this is the time to be a theoretical physicist. Let's start with Ken.

41
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.880
What would you see if you looked into a black hole?

42
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.270
<v 0>Uh, that's a great question. So, well,</v>

43
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.600
first approximation in my, you know, physicist way of saying things, uh,

44
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.610
you wouldn't see anything coming from the inside because in some

45
00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:46.190
ways, by definition, at least in classical physics,

46
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.660
the black hole is not letting anything escape from it.

47
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.603
Now,

48
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.220
one of the things people think about a lot in recent times has

49
00:02:58.221 --> 00:03:02.380
been black holes say at the, when you combine them with quantum physics.

50
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.420
Cause when quantum physics is included,

51
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.670
there is some sort of mechanism which goes back to Stephen

52
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:13.170
Hawking, who you may have heard of. Right? Who said, uh,

53
00:03:13.171 --> 00:03:17.020
and showed that when you combine quantum physics with black holes,

54
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:20.800
there's a sense in which they radiate stuff out.

55
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.000
And there's a way of thinking about it. That means that in some sense,

56
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.930
the stuff is coming out, uh, energies coming out from the black hole,

57
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.950
it's losing energy.

58
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.960
Now one perspective says it's just some quantum stuff happening near the horizon

59
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.740
and it comes out and it isn't really coming from the inside.

60
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.220
But another perspective says that in some sense,

61
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.310
it is telling you stuff about the inside of a black hole.

62
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.350
So people are very excited about trying to understand the

63
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:52.660
full quantum story of a black hole,

64
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.500
because it tells you essentially about the fate of the black hole,

65
00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:58.210
the fate of what fell in,

66
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.230
ultimately that stuff all has to come out this

67
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.780
process by which the black hole evaporates. If that is a bet is a real thing.

68
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.290
Now, I shouldn't say that, um, uh, you know,

69
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:16.240
black holes that we see in astrophysics made from collapsed stars or even

70
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:21.160
larger, uh, they're they're they're evaporation time. Uh,

71
00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:24.280
and the evaporation effects of the quantum physics are essentially negligible.

72
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.970
They, they,

73
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.350
it would take so long to lose any significant amount of energy that you'd wait

74
00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:31.210
longer than the lifetime of the universe.

75
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.460
So this is very much in the realm of what if in the theoretical physics

76
00:04:36.461 --> 00:04:41.230
world, where you're thinking about the fate of perhaps small black holes,

77
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:42.490
if they were to be discovered.

78
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.630
<v 3>You used the term. What if we, it's very,</v>

79
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.960
very rare that we get a get stuck in a plug. It's the show. What if,

80
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.100
so that kind of covers what we would see what might be in a black hole and what

81
00:04:53.101 --> 00:04:55.440
might be emanating from a black hole. Uh,

82
00:04:55.441 --> 00:05:00.030
but if we take this visionary theoretical journey, uh, bright to its conclusion,

83
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.870
what would we see on the other side of a black hole?

84
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.090
<v 0>Oh, well, that's an interesting question. Uh, debate part of that,</v>

85
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.770
part of the question would then be, I would have to go, well,

86
00:05:10.771 --> 00:05:14.370
what do you mean by the other side? Uh,

87
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.940
if you think of it as, is there another side? Yes,

88
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.510
it's a three-dimensional hole, right. And one of,

89
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.590
one of my gripes that I have sometimes with how this is these sorts of things

90
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.790
that portrayed and movies and stuff, uh,

91
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.700
is they tend to, they tend to,

92
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.800
they tend to think of it as like a circle and then you sort of fall in

93
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.360
and you go somewhere, but where it's, it's more of a, it's more of a sphere.

94
00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:45.780
You can approach it from many different directions and you'd go in.

95
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.170
So the other side is sort of a weird thing to think about because it isn't,

96
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.240
you don't mean, I think the other side so much as you mean the other place,

97
00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:58.670
it may go to can imagine that there's another

98
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.260
spherical object somewhere else, which is like the other end of that hole.

99
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.810
And you would then emerge from outcoming out of that.

100
00:06:08.811 --> 00:06:12.320
And that would be like the exit. Does that make sense? Oh.

101
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.210
<v 2>Wow. Like a wormhole type thing.</v>

102
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.830
<v 0>Well that, you know,</v>

103
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:20.570
those are among the things that people have speculated about and you can

104
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:22.250
find, uh,

105
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.240
solutions of the equations of relativity,

106
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:29.210
which is where we study black holes that, that, um,

107
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.630
that give you those scenarios. But the, the plumbing is,

108
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.320
is higher dimensional than we normally think. All right. You think for example,

109
00:06:36.321 --> 00:06:40.850
of, uh, uh, of, uh, uh, like a garden hose, right? As one end,

110
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.770
and that's essentially a circle,

111
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.760
a disc that you go into and then you come out the other end instead you would

112
00:06:46.761 --> 00:06:48.500
have a whole sphere,

113
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.390
which is like a higher dimensional circle. And then you come out the,

114
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.960
a sphere somewhere else. If you were to engineer a wormhole,

115
00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.550
as far as we know that, um, that's, uh, that's fraught with, uh,

116
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.720
physics difficulty,

117
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.880
real stable wormholes are not thought to be possible as far as we understand,

118
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.900
but it's fun to think about them. And of course we use them in science fiction,

119
00:07:11.901 --> 00:07:12.734
a law.

120
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.280
<v 2>And, and Einstein left the door open for that. Didn't he?</v>

121
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.860
<v 0>Well, he not only left the door open. He, he, he, he helped discover the door,</v>

122
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.940
right? The, the original wormhole, uh, solution,

123
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:30.190
um, was, was discovered by Einstein and, uh, and Rosen.

124
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.380
And there was a paper where, uh, they actually pointed out that you could,

125
00:07:35.381 --> 00:07:40.330
by examining the geometry of the, of the standard black hole solution,

126
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:42.790
that's used to study real astrophysical, black holes.

127
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.160
You can actually see that it contains the possibility

128
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:52.810
of indeed going what seems to be into the black hole

129
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:57.010
and then coming out another side. And it's like,

130
00:07:57.011 --> 00:08:00.550
you're N you're at like exiting from a different black hole,

131
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.000
or it's the same black hole up to you, how you think about it.

132
00:08:04.001 --> 00:08:06.340
And that was the wormhole solution,

133
00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.280
otherwise known as the Einstein Rosen bridge,

134
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.510
a bridge between two different sort of regions,

135
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.620
but as they already observed, uh,

136
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.850
you'd have to do things like move faster than the speed of light to, to, to,

137
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.660
to traverse that wormhole. Um, before it collapsed few,

138
00:08:25.661 --> 00:08:30.100
few nuts to crack that tend to collapse before you can do anything with them.

139
00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:32.530
<v 2>If, if anybody's seen the, uh,</v>

140
00:08:32.531 --> 00:08:36.880
the opening or seen the show raised by wolves on HBO, max, I believe,

141
00:08:36.881 --> 00:08:41.860
but the opening has them essentially doing exactly what you

142
00:08:41.861 --> 00:08:46.180
just described going through popping out another sphere. Uh, we're checking out.

143
00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:49.180
You can watch, I believe it's just the opening is on YouTube.

144
00:08:49.181 --> 00:08:50.470
It's worth checking out. It's kind of a,

145
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.030
an illustrated vision of that theoretical idea. Um,

146
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.170
theoretical being sort of the key word when we're talking about big wood ifs,

147
00:08:58.171 --> 00:09:00.810
especially something like black holes and looking through them,

148
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:05.190
but is it possible that these things will be a little less

149
00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:06.040
theoretical,

150
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:11.010
theoretical and a little more concrete as we develop new technology?

151
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:15.510
I know that there's the event, horizon telescope and the Virgo cluster,

152
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.520
you know, there's other bigger telescopes go.

153
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:22.260
Do you anticipate we're going to be able to learn a lot more from these,

154
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:25.680
these new eyes on these black holes?

155
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:31.670
<v 0>Well, well, um, uh, the event horizon telescope is, is, is a wonderful example,</v>

156
00:09:31.671 --> 00:09:36.320
as you say, of what you can do with new technology.

157
00:09:36.321 --> 00:09:36.681
And it's,

158
00:09:36.681 --> 00:09:40.490
in some ways it's new technology combined with old technology in the following

159
00:09:40.491 --> 00:09:44.990
sense while the event horizon telescope is it's actually a network of

160
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:48.260
existing telescopes and new ones being built will be added.

161
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.120
It's a network of telescopes all around the earth that you connect

162
00:09:53.121 --> 00:09:56.030
together by. Uh,

163
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.780
so you're getting them all to look in the same direction at the same object.

164
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:04.610
And so that essentially gives you one massive telescope, the size of the earth,

165
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:09.500
which is what you need in order to see something very far away in great detail.

166
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:10.970
And, uh,

167
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:15.830
the technological aspect there is that you need to somehow combine

168
00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:20.780
all that information from all those different telescopes in the right way, uh,

169
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:23.600
with amazing computer technology,

170
00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:27.460
amazing collaboration by hundreds of scientists, uh,

171
00:10:27.461 --> 00:10:31.910
and they collaborate in order to combine these data using modern algorithms and

172
00:10:31.911 --> 00:10:33.860
super fast computers to do that.

173
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.830
And then essentially turns it into one giant telescope.

174
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:42.140
So indeed the landmark thing that you probably all saw in the

175
00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:46.820
news, um, what was it last year? I think it was last year, right?

176
00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.960
That, that first image all the black hole event horizon,

177
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:55.550
which I remind you because people often miss this fact,

178
00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:00.590
it's the first time we're seeing in any extended

179
00:11:00.591 --> 00:11:03.050
sense of the word, seeing a black hole,

180
00:11:03.051 --> 00:11:06.680
or at least the event horizon the shadow of the black hole against the stuff

181
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:07.820
that's glowing around it.

182
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:13.340
Every other image you've ever seen depicting a black hole has been an

183
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.120
artist impression. It's easy to forget that because, you know,

184
00:11:17.121 --> 00:11:20.390
you see these wonderful artists impressions of matter,

185
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.560
coming off one star on falling into a black hole,

186
00:11:24.561 --> 00:11:29.360
it looks super realistic. An artist did that. Um, except in this case,

187
00:11:29.361 --> 00:11:34.160
this really is real data turned into what it would look like. And so, um,

188
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:38.870
we're gonna learn a lot more about black holes that way. And, um, I think,

189
00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:40.221
uh, you know,

190
00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:45.050
whether or not the business of whether you can see into it and see out the other

191
00:11:45.051 --> 00:11:48.020
side, or what have you, um, which is,

192
00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.920
which is probably going to remain speculative in, in some sense, uh,

193
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:56.650
we're going to learn a lot about the black holes themselves and, and,

194
00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:59.890
uh, what, how they, how they, uh,

195
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.550
dominate the physics in the core of our galaxy,

196
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:07.780
how they interact with the stuff there, how they, uh, different,

197
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.170
how different galaxies black holes are different from each other,

198
00:12:11.171 --> 00:12:16.010
as we start imaging other black holes, it's, it's going to be huge. Uh, the,

199
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.740
the amount of stuff we're going to learn from that.

200
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:22.960
And it is awesome that we're really looking at the shadow of a

201
00:12:22.961 --> 00:12:27.580
black hole with our own eyes, uh, for the first time in our history,

202
00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.170
you know, civilizations, history.

203
00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.400
<v 2>Spectacular, super cool professor.</v>

204
00:12:32.401 --> 00:12:36.780
Thanks very much for taking us through this speculative vision quest. Uh,

205
00:12:36.781 --> 00:12:38.820
where can people go to find your work?

206
00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:40.830
<v 0>Well? Um,</v>

207
00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:45.540
it's probably easiest to find me on either Instagram or Twitter or

208
00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.780
Facebook by just, well, just Google my name and physics,

209
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.000
Clifford Johnson physics. That's the easiest way,

210
00:12:51.001 --> 00:12:52.050
rather than trying to figure out what.

211
00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:57.000
<v 2>I w I would also, sorry, go on. I was just going to say, that's what I did.</v>

212
00:12:57.001 --> 00:13:00.540
And it brought me down the whole Clifford Johnson rabbit hole too.

213
00:13:00.541 --> 00:13:03.180
So I would it, to your point, it's the best place to start.

214
00:13:03.181 --> 00:13:06.210
Clifford Johnson physics may be USC as well.

215
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.550
<v 0>Yeah. And you'll find, uh, you'll find, uh, uh, like I said, uh, lots of,</v>

216
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.300
lots of, uh, thoughts, discussions on my blog, um,

217
00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:20.460
images I share of, uh, physics ideas or other things, um,

218
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.770
uh, other activities I get up to,

219
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:27.450
and you'll find your way maybe also to my non-fiction graphic book about,

220
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.650
um, the nature of the universe. I wish I wrote and drew a couple of years ago,

221
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:32.970
published by MIT press.

222
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:37.020
There's a lot of ideas in there about space and time and quantum physics,

223
00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.140
a little bit about black holes and how you can use them as time machines,

224
00:13:40.141 --> 00:13:41.490
for example, and things like that.

225
00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:46.110
<v 2>Thank you, professor Johnson, uh, in quantum physics,</v>

226
00:13:46.111 --> 00:13:47.700
there's something called the observer effect,

227
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:52.350
which is very interesting in that literally what you see and what I see

228
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.810
of the same thing might be different.

229
00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:00.030
So when you apply it to especially things as theoretical as black holes,

230
00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:05.310
when we're asking, well, what would you see if you saw through a black hole?

231
00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:09.510
Well, of course, you know, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, as they say,

232
00:14:09.511 --> 00:14:10.530
who knows what you're going to see,

233
00:14:10.531 --> 00:14:13.620
but at least when you talk to somebody like professor Johnson,

234
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.180
you at least get a better guidance system on what you'd be looking for.

235
00:14:18.181 --> 00:14:22.380
Because here I'm asking that question in a two dimensional sense,

236
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.470
and I hadn't even thought that, of course that's idiotic. Yeah.

237
00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:30.390
They say there's no dumb questions, but maybe that was, yeah,

238
00:14:30.391 --> 00:14:33.330
no, I always thought too, that a black hole is just a, you know,

239
00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:37.950
it's a hole and you fall into it not realizing it's physical or it's

240
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.240
three-dimensional of course it's not a black hole. It's a black aura. Yes,

241
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.051
exactly. Really.

242
00:14:43.051 --> 00:14:46.440
He sort of helped us understand that and helps us understand a few others.

243
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:51.500
Right? Well, we'll be seeing more black holes not coming up anytime soon. Uh,

244
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.070
as our.

245
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.690
<v 3>Technology gets a stronger,</v>

246
00:14:53.691 --> 00:14:58.550
as we send a Hubble or web telescopes into space and get a better look and

247
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.870
usher in basically a new era of space exploration. Uh,

248
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:07.340
and we'll also explore a little bit more with the professor Johnson on the

249
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:09.590
extended audio podcasts. Now,

250
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.650
if you're watching us and you want to hear more,

251
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:16.250
we'll just click on the link below and you can join the extended audio podcasts.

252
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:20.210
If you are already listening to the audio podcasts, don't worry.

253
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.550
There's nothing to click on. Just keep listening.

254
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.190
We'll be with you in just a second now. Uh,

255
00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.680
if you are watching on video and you're leaving us, we'll thanks for joining us.

256
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:31.340
We'll see you next week on another. What if discussed.
