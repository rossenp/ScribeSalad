00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.330
<v 0>Sand worms are gross, looking little things,</v>

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.330
maybe a little bit cute. I almost feel bad using them as bait.

3
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.290
What if instead of us hunting them,

4
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.990
they were able to hunt us.

5
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.160
Could they make it from water onto land?

6
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.450
How much food would they need to sustain themselves?

7
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.270
And what's so unusual about the way they eat you.

8
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.750
This, what if,

9
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.940
and here's what would happen if sand worms were the size of humans,

10
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.140
you might find sand worms gross, but they're nothing to be afraid of.

11
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.750
Usually that is sand worms live in deep tunnels

12
00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:55.310
at the bottom of the seat where they pray on lugworms and some small

13
00:00:55.311 --> 00:00:56.150
bivalves,

14
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.740
the way they hunt and eat their prey is pretty terrifying.

15
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.480
We're lucky that they don't get larger than 80 centimeters in length,

16
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.910
because if they did well, you'd better see for yourself.

17
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.120
The most horrifying thing about a sand worm is its big strong

18
00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:17.954
jaw,

19
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.550
sand worms use it to grab onto poor victims.

20
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.130
And this thing that comes out of its mouth is part of the digestive

21
00:01:28.131 --> 00:01:32.360
tract. Yeah, they can push it outside of their bodies.

22
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.833
Ooh.

23
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.950
The good thing is sand worms are omnivores,

24
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.250
which means they eat both plants and animals.

25
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.850
That's good because if they were carnivores,

26
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.770
they for sure would want to eat you.

27
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.810
But now there might be a slight chance. You'd be safe.

28
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.280
Naturally sand worms are very introverted.

29
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.080
They don't like to leave their burrows.

30
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.010
Splash giant sand worms would be good swimmers.

31
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.590
They mostly feed on algae and scavenge fish in smaller Marine animals,

32
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.880
even birds that hunt near shallow waters might become dinner.

33
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.400
And what about people?

34
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.310
Most likely human sized sand worms wouldn't eat humans that

35
00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:24.950
often just try not to make them angry,

36
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.300
but this doesn't mean you'd be completely safe.

37
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.060
Sand worms don't have eyes.

38
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.450
They couldn't see you when they were searching for food.

39
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:39.920
So they could accidentally bite you because of their

40
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.090
increased size sand worms would need to consume more food.

41
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.160
They might leave their home waters of the Antarctic and Arctic oceans and

42
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.350
spread further across the planet.

43
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.700
They might even have to evolve and move on to land.

44
00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.400
So as not to become extinct the most time would be

45
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.520
during their mating season when they leave their burrows.

46
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.510
But not because they'd be out and about.

47
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.410
They'd have other things on their mind. If you know what I mean,

48
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.260
it would be dangerous because larger predators would travel to shallow waters to

49
00:03:19.261 --> 00:03:20.094
feed on them.

50
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.990
Some beaches would be off limits and would have to post warnings about the sand

51
00:03:24.991 --> 00:03:29.070
worms. If they became too much of a problem,

52
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.670
humans might decide to reduce the sand worm population.

53
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.360
And didn't I tell you not to make them angry.

54
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.390
Hunting sand worms would do precisely that they might

55
00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.400
want to get their revenge.

56
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.450
If a sand worm was coming after you,

57
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.490
it would happen in the water unless we're talking about giant evolved

58
00:03:53.491 --> 00:03:57.060
sand worms that would live on land, but more on that in a minute,

59
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.170
a sand worm would grab you with its strong jaw.

60
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.630
Its mouth would be full of sharp teeth and the bite would be excruciating.

61
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.280
A sand worm. That's bigger than you might try to swallow.

62
00:04:11.281 --> 00:04:15.690
You hit wouldn't chew you much. So you'd end up in its wreaking,

63
00:04:15.691 --> 00:04:17.610
slippery crop right away.

64
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.360
That's where worms temporarily store their food.

65
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.090
You might still be conscious and in a lot of pain in the worms

66
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.930
gizzard, you'd get ground up together with ingested sand.

67
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.320
If you were to escape, you'd better do that.

68
00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:38.100
Now while you still might be able to cut your way out with a sharp object,

69
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:39.600
if not,

70
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.890
you'd move through its intestine where all your nutrients would be absorbed,

71
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.650
whatever was left of you would be cooped up. Well,

72
00:04:48.651 --> 00:04:52.830
let's just hope that sand worms wouldn't evolve into spice producing

73
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.330
750 meter long thick skin desert living giants

74
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.150
you'd stand no chance against those.

75
00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.640
Well maybe if you yourself grew to be five meters tall,

76
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.190
but that's a story for another, whatever.
