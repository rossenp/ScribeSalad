00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.190
<v 0>What would happen if our planet got too close to a black hole?</v>

2
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.220
Well, according to science fiction,

3
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.050
we'd be sucked into a parallel universe or maybe

4
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.260
even the future. But in reality,

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.390
it wouldn't be nearly that fun. Instead,

6
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.900
our planet would be ripped apart piece by piece,

7
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.880
starting with our atmosphere.

8
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.850
So what if we moved a little further back instead of the black

9
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:37.650
hole being right beside us,

10
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.920
we move it to the center of our solar system.

11
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.070
Would our planet still be destroyed?

12
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.050
And what would that do to our solar system as a whole?

13
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.600
This is what if,

14
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.700
and here's what would happen if the solar system orbited a black hole,

15
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.190
this black hole has the same mass as our sun.

16
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.490
If we were to place it next to our sun,

17
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.290
the two objects would orbit each other at a close distance about one

18
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:12.900
10th, the distance between earth and the sun.

19
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.110
This would mean that our solar system was now orbiting a local point with twice

20
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:22.110
the mass of the sun. As a result,

21
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.550
the planets would have to orbit faster to avoid getting pulled inwards

22
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.280
a year on earth would decrease from 365 days to

23
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.290
258 days.

24
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.570
And the amount of energy from the sun would vary as it orbited closer to

25
00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:43.110
and farther away from earth. Other than that,

26
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.180
life would pretty well be the same,

27
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.880
but what if we replaced our son with a black hole completely

28
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.400
well, we'd have a lot more to worry about than just the length of a year,

29
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.020
which by the way, would be over in the blink of an eye.

30
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.490
The biggest problem we would face if we replaced the sun with a black hole would

31
00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:13.490
be the absence of incoming solar energy.

32
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.970
The planet earth would go completely dark.

33
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.350
Thanks to our planet's infamous greenhouse gas effect.

34
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.070
The global temperature wouldn't be reduced instantaneously,

35
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.680
but after the first week,

36
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.230
average surface temperature would drop to zero degrees and then

37
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.490
to negative 101 degrees. By the end of the first year,

38
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.920
you think that our planet quickly becoming an ice world would be bad enough,

39
00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:47.240
but we're just getting started without sunlight.

40
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.460
There would be no photosynthesis.

41
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.790
The process by which all plants generate food,

42
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.450
small plants would die. In a matter of days,

43
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.020
this would create a ripple throughout the entire food chain causing us

44
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.090
all to starve to death eventually,

45
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.060
but maybe there is a way we can get usable energy from a black

46
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:14.020
hole, and it all starts with something called C M B

47
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.420
C M B. Also known as cosmic microwave.

48
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:23.770
Background is the weak radiation leftover from the big bang.

49
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.540
Theoretically, if a black hole spins fast enough,

50
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.340
it can compress the CMB radiation into optical wavelengths.

51
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.980
The same wavelengths that are admitted by the sun.

52
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.080
The wavelengths would funnel into a narrow beam. And before you know it,

53
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.560
our planet would have usable energy once again, right?

54
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.380
But there is a small catch.

55
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.590
The faster rotation of the black hole would also pull the planetary

56
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:58.180
orbits in closer to the point of no escape for the

57
00:03:58.181 --> 00:04:02.500
planetary orbits to remain stable and avoid being sucked up.

58
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.760
The orbital velocity of the planets would need to be close to the speed of

59
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:07.594
light.

60
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.370
This means that a year on earth would be over before the blink of an eye

61
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.910
so much for your big new year's Eve party.

62
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.760
But there's no time to worry about that because we've got bigger issues coming

63
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:22.594
our way.

64
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.850
<v 1>If any material like meteors satellites or spaces.</v>

65
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.280
<v 0>Debris get sucked into the black hole,</v>

66
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.970
it will result in a blast of radiation coming our way.

67
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.600
And when the radiation arrives at our planet,

68
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.310
it will blow away our atmosphere killing anything in its past.

69
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.510
So even though the sun can be annoying,

70
00:04:48.511 --> 00:04:53.040
sometimes when it comes to things to orbit around,

71
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.620
we could do a lot worse. The next time you look up at a sunny sky,

72
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.640
don't take it for granted. It will disappear one day,

73
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.250
but that's a story for another, whatever.
