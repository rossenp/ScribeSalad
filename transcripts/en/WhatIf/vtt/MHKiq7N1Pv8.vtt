00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.260
<v 0>It comes to energy.</v>

2
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.300
We have a long way to go before our utility bills become a

3
00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:21.200
thing of the past on the Carta chef's scale,

4
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.620
we're still a type zero civilization,

5
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.190
but we're closer than ever to harnessing Earth's energies.

6
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.690
So what would it take for us to become a type two or

7
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.490
stellar civilization?

8
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.330
How could we harness the energy of our son?

9
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.790
What could prevent us from getting to the next level on the scale

10
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.720
and how would our lives change?

11
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.570
This is what if,

12
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.100
and here's what would happen if we became a type two civilization,

13
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.590
okay. If you're new to the car to Chev scale, to put it simply,

14
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.510
it's a way to measure a civilization's level of technological advancement based

15
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.460
on the amount and types of energy that it can use has a type

16
00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:17.180
zero civilization. We are a sub global culture,

17
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.130
meaning we still get the majority of our energy from organic sources like

18
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.350
wood, coal, and oil in order to reach type work.

19
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.180
One, we'll have to master the use of all the forms of energy on earth,

20
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.920
not just fossil fuels

21
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.600
with many advancements in solar, wind,

22
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.710
hydro and geothermal power. We're almost there

23
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.030
to earn a type two rating on the scale.

24
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.080
We'd need to be able to use all the power of our son.

25
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.350
So what could we do with it

26
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.510
in order to become a type two or stellar civilization,

27
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.110
we'll need to build a massive swarm of energy,

28
00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:07.280
collecting satellites around the sun, known as a Dyson swarm.

29
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.580
You can learn more about this in our other video.

30
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.220
What if we built a Dyson sphere around our sun,

31
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.100
but before we start building,

32
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.430
we will have to improve a lot of things here on earth.

33
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.280
There are many potential dangers to humanity that could stop us in our tracks,

34
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.360
including climate change or pandemics,

35
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.110
and even asteroids. Speaking of asteroids,

36
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.940
NASA has been hard at work,

37
00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:39.410
developing their dark project or double asteroid redirection test.

38
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.050
In 2021,

39
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.820
NASA will launch the dark satellite on a collision course with the near earth

40
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.283
asteroids, Diddy moon,

41
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.030
which orbits the larger and more threatening asteroid Diddy Moss.

42
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.000
This collision will increase Diddy moons, orbital speed by about four minutes,

43
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.820
which is just enough time to alter the larger asteroid Moss's

44
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.070
trajectory away from earth.

45
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.010
Creating the first artificial meteor shower.

46
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.890
If this proves to be a successful defense against threatening asteroids,

47
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.050
it could help us pave the way to becoming a type one civilization and

48
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.980
eventually type two. If we're lucky, mind you.

49
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.190
If we had the power of our entire sun at our fingertips,

50
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.720
we could simply vaporize any potential threats to our planet. In fact,

51
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.470
we could move earth out of harm's way. If we wanted to,

52
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.560
theoretically, we could control the orbits of everything in our solar system.

53
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.450
Using a Dyson swarm could also make other planets more habitable

54
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.300
with the help of these solar satellites.

55
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.010
We could carefully control any planet's temperature by redirecting the sun's

56
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:54.844
energy.

57
00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.070
We could start terraforming nearby planets to give us new places to live.

58
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.330
This would even let us take interplanetary vacation,

59
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.110
anyone up for a ski trip to Mars. In fact,

60
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.190
why stop at Mars with limitless solar energy at our disposal,

61
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.730
we can travel almost anywhere in our solar system

62
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.840
technology. At this point would likely make space,

63
00:04:21.841 --> 00:04:26.550
travel available and affordable to everyone. Right now,

64
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.980
a ticket to space could cost anywhere from $250,000 to

65
00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:36.630
tens of millions of dollars. There's so much for my mortgage.

66
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.450
We might even be able to solve our climate change problems by partially

67
00:04:42.451 --> 00:04:44.400
shading the earth with the Dyson sphere,

68
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.270
giving us time to heal and rebuild our atmosphere

69
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.440
with no more air pollution from fossil fuels.

70
00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.350
We'd be a much healthier and happier species,

71
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.680
but before you breathe easy,

72
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.690
we have a lot of work to do here on earth before we even become a type one

73
00:05:03.691 --> 00:05:07.770
civilization. And as you may have guessed,

74
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.640
that's a story for another, what else.
