00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.270
<v 0>If you're only eating sugar, you're not getting the vitamins.</v>

2
00:00:03.271 --> 00:00:04.350
You're not getting the minerals.

3
00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:07.290
You're not getting the essential fatty acids that you need.

4
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:10.200
You're not getting the protein that you need. Um,

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.710
we could debate whether or not you need fiber in the diet,

6
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.200
but we probably won't go there at the moment. Um,

7
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.610
so I'm gonna guess that within a reasonably short time, you're going to die.

8
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:24.870
The question is, can you survive, um, 30 days?

9
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.270
<v 1>So Pete, would you be considered a sweet tooth?</v>

10
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.800
Would I consider myself a sweet tooth?

11
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.290
<v 2>I would say a little bit of, I would say yes and no.</v>

12
00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:50.990
I'm not one of those guys where you, after dinner, they're like, Hey,

13
00:00:50.991 --> 00:00:54.440
what's for dessert. I would never order dessert. And I,

14
00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:57.920
if somebody offered me cake or sweets or whatever, I probably wouldn't take it.

15
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.470
But if there's a bowl of candy on the table,

16
00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:03.340
or if I'm in a store where there's chocolate bars, I'm,

17
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.090
I just can't get enough chocolate.

18
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.430
<v 1>Never been known for my self discipline.</v>

19
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.170
That wouldn't be something that would be on my, a Wikipedia page. If I had one,

20
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.040
uh, I've been known to, I have my kryptonite. So, you know,

21
00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:18.770
I've been known to eat a cheesecake. For instance.

22
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.490
<v 2>I ate cheese cake, a whole cheesecake slice, or you mean a slice. You,</v>

23
00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:24.324
you heard me.

24
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.230
<v 1>But obviously we deal with hypotheticals here at what if,</v>

25
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.590
and it does sound initially when you say,

26
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.130
what if you ate only sugar for a month? Well,

27
00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:41.690
that's a wild hypothetical except for the period we're in

28
00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:44.900
now, which is going to smack dab in the middle of that time,

29
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.950
where it's very possible for people to eat sugar every day,

30
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.630
which is of course the holiday.

31
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.020
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

32
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.680
this is when everybody is buying extra chocolate to put on the tables to hand

33
00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:57.290
out, people are coming to your door. Here's just, here's some chocolate,

34
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.690
there's baked goods coming out of the oven,

35
00:01:59.691 --> 00:02:02.300
seemingly every half hour in bowls of candy on every,

36
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.380
it's kind of a great thing.

37
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.260
<v 1>It's a built-in excuse in which we loved.</v>

38
00:02:06.261 --> 00:02:10.880
So as a public service that we are doing for the word of community,

39
00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:15.620
we thought we would ask what if you ate only sugar for a month?

40
00:02:15.621 --> 00:02:19.130
And of course that isn't something that most people would have a lot of

41
00:02:19.131 --> 00:02:22.640
knowledge about. And you would really want to talk to somebody who's,

42
00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:26.210
who's really done a lot of research around the specific issue of sugar.

43
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.200
So we are very fortunate to be joined by the New York times.

44
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.300
Best-selling author of the case against sugar, Gary Taubes. Gary,

45
00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:37.130
thanks for joining us today on what if discussion.

46
00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.650
<v 0>Gentlemen, thank you for having me.</v>

47
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.600
<v 1>So, uh,</v>

48
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.650
as we talked about pros and cons of a 30 day sugar diet,

49
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.980
I'm going to guess the doll on a prose. We'll get to that in a second,

50
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.160
but let's get back to the Seminole book, the case against sugar.

51
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.600
What was your ultimate conclusion? Was sugar guilt.

52
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.790
<v 0>Well, are you, I mean, my, the book, if you don't think so.</v>

53
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.770
And I copped to that in the beginning, the argument I'm making in the book. So,

54
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.900
I mean, we've never had a period of our history where, you know,

55
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.080
Princeton's parents didn't think they had a ration, their, their children,

56
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:16.330
sugar consumption, right? So it's always,

57
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.990
there's always been this concept of too much. Sugar is always been out there,

58
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:23.980
but what does too much sugar do was the question and

59
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.080
what I'm addressing,

60
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:29.740
particularly as we have an epidemic of obesity and diabetes, worldwide,

61
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.560
whatever, any population,

62
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.920
the world transitioned from whatever their traditional diet is.

63
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:40.750
It could be anything from an agrarian diet and Southeast Asia to

64
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:45.550
a animal diet within you. And the, you know,

65
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:49.090
Mussai in Africa and they transitioned eating Western diets,

66
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:53.890
they get obese and diabetic. You have explosions of obesity and diabetes.

67
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.390
And the argument is that what happens is they just eat too much and they become

68
00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:03.230
sedentary. And that's why you get these epidemics. And the,

69
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.940
the counter-argument is that it's sugar, particularly that causes it.

70
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:11.290
Not because of the calories in the sugar, but because of the, uh,

71
00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.130
you could think of it as the hormonal effects of consuming sugar,

72
00:04:15.131 --> 00:04:19.660
the way your body responds to sugar differently than other foods.

73
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.420
And, you know,

74
00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:25.990
I just was lucky as a journalist or unlucky as a journalist,

75
00:04:25.991 --> 00:04:29.500
I get to spend about 10 years of my life studying this question,

76
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.750
and it's clear that sugar should be considered uniquely harmful.

77
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.280
And then the way I put it, if I was a district attorney,

78
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.700
I could get an indictment effortless life.

79
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.090
I'm not sure I could get a conviction because we've never actually done the

80
00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:49.480
studies that would allow you to say what I believe without, you know, with,

81
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.490
with outreach, winnable doubt.

82
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.440
<v 1>Yeah. Like you, like you say, it does seem to be a bit of an open and shut case,</v>

83
00:04:55.441 --> 00:04:57.210
but if the jury is still out on sugar,

84
00:04:57.211 --> 00:05:01.110
it's ultimately because of the inability to get more than circumstantial

85
00:05:01.111 --> 00:05:03.630
evidence against the sweet stuff. Why is that?

86
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.440
<v 0>Well, the conventional wisdom again, is that the problem was sugars.</v>

87
00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:12.000
We just eat too much of it to empty calories. You've all heard that phrase,

88
00:05:12.001 --> 00:05:13.470
right? It's got empty calories.

89
00:05:13.471 --> 00:05:17.070
So if you have a lot of sugar in your diet and you have to get the vitamins and

90
00:05:17.071 --> 00:05:21.780
minerals and protein and fiber and essential fatty acids from other

91
00:05:21.781 --> 00:05:25.470
foods, so then you're going to overeat those and you're going to get obese.

92
00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:30.330
And once you get obese, that's going to be the trigger of your diabetes.

93
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.990
So there's this whole mindset in the book.

94
00:05:33.991 --> 00:05:36.270
I refer to it as the gift that keeps on giving,

95
00:05:36.271 --> 00:05:39.390
which is the reason you get fat is because you eat too much.

96
00:05:39.391 --> 00:05:41.700
You take in more calories than you expend.

97
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.540
And the worst you could say about sugar is that we like it too much.

98
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.680
<v 1>We're going to take a quick break here on what if discussed, uh,</v>

99
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.060
more with the author of the case against sugar, Gary Taubes.

100
00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:58.220
On the other side, you are watching and listening to if discussed.

101
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.270
<v 2>We want to take just a moment to tell you about today's sponsor the great</v>

102
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:03.230
courses, plus a.

103
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.120
<v 1>Streaming service. We're both really big on.</v>

104
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.510
<v 2>Yeah, that's right. We've been watching and learning a lot during the pandemic.</v>

105
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.370
I've been looking into a new course.

106
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:14.510
They've got online called mathematical brain teasers and logic puzzles.

107
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.750
You know, I love learning about other languages or like, you know,

108
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:20.240
about Ireland or photography was one of the one that I did.

109
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:24.170
But also sometimes I just want to stretch my brain out. And, uh, and uh,

110
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.280
I dunno, just go for a workout on my brain. Yeah. Good.

111
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.630
<v 1>Brain workout. I'm a big puzzle person. Loved the jumble. Love the crossword.</v>

112
00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.850
<v 2>Sudoku. No, not so much. It's just, I'm not a math person. It's not math.</v>

113
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.330
It's just, it's one. I'm not a smart person. I'll give you some tips.

114
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.410
I've got some tips for you, uh, on Sudoku, regardless. The great courses,

123
00:07:09.611 --> 00:07:13.810
today, we were talking about what if you ate sugar for a month straight?

124
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.690
So where do I do my research? Great courses, plus.com,

125
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:20.020
how sugar and salt shape world history, lecture. Number 12,

126

from the course food science and the human body. They got everything here.

127
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.310
<v 2>I'm glad you're doing all the research for this because if somebody got who</v>

128
00:07:27.311 --> 00:07:28.780

<v 1>F. Now back to the show.</v>

136
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:01.690
<v 2>So Gary, you sort of outlined what happens to the body when you eat sugar,</v>

137
00:08:01.691 --> 00:08:05.800
what goes on inside you with all those [inaudible] happening? Uh,

138
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:10.540
but what if you only ate sugar for one month, for 30 days? That's our,

139
00:08:10.541 --> 00:08:13.600
what if this week, uh, what would happen, Gary?

140
00:08:13.601 --> 00:08:15.850
I can't imagine you'd be in great shape after 30 days.

141
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.020
<v 0>If you're only eating sugar, you're not getting the vitamins.</v>

142
00:08:20.021 --> 00:08:21.100
You're not getting the minerals.

143
00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:24.070
You're not getting the essential fatty acids that you need.

144
00:08:24.071 --> 00:08:27.770
You're not getting the protein that you need. Um, they,

145
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.460
we could debate whether or not you need fiber in the diet,

146
00:08:30.461 --> 00:08:32.980
but we probably won't go there at the moment. Um,

147
00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:37.360
so I'm gonna guess that within a reasonably short time, you're going to die.

148
00:08:37.361 --> 00:08:41.470
The question is, can you survive 30 days? Yeah.

149
00:08:41.471 --> 00:08:42.790
And we don't recommend you try this.

150
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.020
<v 1>At home and less,</v>

151
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.100
obviously you're part of that experiment that Gary's talking about. Um,

152
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:52.540
Gary want to talk about a whole bunch more, especially a big part of, you know,

153
00:08:52.541 --> 00:08:57.330
the case against sugar was, was outlining, how was used or misused.

154
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.160
Let's say that to be able to make the case for sugar and against fat. Um,

155
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:06.840
we'll get to that on the, uh, on the other side, in the audio version, but this,

156
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:07.561
I don't know,

157
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:10.770
I'm just speculating that the research and going down this particular rabbit

158
00:09:10.771 --> 00:09:14.970
hole for years, uh, got you to better understand nutrition in general,

159
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:18.030
hence the case for Quito to your new book,

160
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:19.950
is that kind of how you arrived there?

161
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.620
<v 0>It's about 90 clinical trials in process right now,</v>

162
00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:29.210
testing the ketogenic diet on virtually every ailment you could imagine,

163
00:09:29.211 --> 00:09:33.650
because often it works very well when they do these tests on beginning with

164
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.910
childhood epilepsy, but, you know, obesity and diabetes. And,

165
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.840
uh, I mean, there are studies looking at it for depression and,

166
00:09:41.841 --> 00:09:46.340
and the cognitive disorders and

167
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.240
you name it they're there. So anyway, that's sort of the,

168
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.360
my first book, good calories,

169
00:09:53.361 --> 00:09:57.050
bad calories in the United States looked at all of this history and all of this

170
00:09:57.051 --> 00:10:01.940
bad science and propose this idea that the problem with modern diets

171
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:06.890
because he's British nutritionist believe is the carbohydrate content of refined

172
00:10:06.891 --> 00:10:08.120
grains and sugars,

173
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:13.160
which has now kind of been accepted and fat was benign.

174
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.950
And when you restrict the carbs and you allow people to eat fat,

175
00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.190
now you're eating a ketogenic diet, and there's a huge movement actually,

176
00:10:19.191 --> 00:10:22.880
particularly in Canada. Um,

177
00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.060
there's a Facebook group in Canada.

178
00:10:26.061 --> 00:10:29.870
I use this to sort of quantify how many physicians have bought into this.

179
00:10:29.871 --> 00:10:32.090
So Facebook group in Canada of women,

180
00:10:32.091 --> 00:10:36.440
physicians who eat low carb, high fat diets,

181
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.550
and there's about 40,000 women physicians in Canada.

182
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.700
And there's about 4,000 on this Facebook group,

183
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:48.320
which suggests that one in 10 women trans in Canada

184
00:10:48.321 --> 00:10:52.940
alone have embraced the way of eating that until very

185
00:10:52.941 --> 00:10:57.050
recently was considered virtually malpractice,

186
00:10:57.051 --> 00:10:58.730
the prescribed to your patients.

187
00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.730
<v 1>Well, the case for Quito is being made. Let's say that,</v>

188
00:11:01.731 --> 00:11:06.710
and that book is available right now as of what I think a couple of days ago.

189
00:11:06.711 --> 00:11:08.590
So if you are something, if,

190
00:11:08.591 --> 00:11:11.180
if you're somebody that's been considering a keto diet,

191
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.990
or certainly somebody wants to understand just more about health and eating

192
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:18.200
highly recommend Gary's book, uh, the case for keto. Gary,

193
00:11:18.201 --> 00:11:19.820

194

<v 0>Sure, sure. Absolutely. Okay, great. Okay.</v>

195
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:23.211
