WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.610
<v 0>What you want to do is find a hundred percent of them. Right now,</v>

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.080
people estimate we found about 90% of that leaves,

3
00:00:10.081 --> 00:00:12.090
10% of asteroids.

4
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:14.760
We don't know where they are and whether or not they're going to cross the

5
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:17.790
Earth's orbit with us there anytime soon.

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.290
So we want to keep watching the skies and finding these things.

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.400
Uh, and then, you know, you want 20 or 30 years notice,

8
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:31.320
so you can do something to keep it from hitting the

9
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:32.154
earth.

10
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.030
<v 1>So, Peter, hello, Richard, how are you? Very well.</v>

11
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.300
I'm going to start right out of the gate. Yes. Come in hot.

12
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.850
How do you feel about Armageddon? Is this,

13
00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:09.530
the topic of today's podcast is sort of the topic of

14
00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:10.200
today's pod.

15
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.140
Are you talking about Armageddon as in the biblical sense of Armageddon,

16
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.870
not the biblical sense of that place,

17
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:21.470
where the final battle between good and evil happens. Uh,

18
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.070
you could argue in some cases, Armageddon, no matter what it is,

19
00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.910
is going to refer to some sort of end of the world scenario. In this case,

20
00:01:28.911 --> 00:01:33.380
I am referring to the classic and I am doing air quotes. If you're listening,

21
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.780
uh, Armageddon, the movie, Michael Bay, Jerry Bruckheimer,

22
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.010
uh, Bruce Willis stars is the head of a plucky blue collar.

23
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.180
He lost me at Michael Bay. Yes. Uh, it is the scenario where,

24
00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:51.620
and the reason applies to today's show is that there is an asteroid barreling

25
00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:55.610
down on the earth. It will essentially wipe out everyone,

26
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.730
Billy Bob Thornton's essentially the NASA guy,

27
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.490
perfect Sydney and their scenarios. Yes, of course.

28
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.170
And their idea to deal with this existential threat is to send up a drilling

29
00:02:06.171 --> 00:02:07.400
team, a deep drilling team,

30
00:02:07.401 --> 00:02:11.470
the best deep drill drilling team to drill into an asteroid,

31
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.590
send up the worst. No, you wouldn't want it. I mean, it,

32
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:16.460
it made sense right out of the gate, go with the best. Um,

33
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.870
and of course there's a great love story with the young Ben Affleck and Liv

34
00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:25.460
Tyler, and of course live Tyler's father Aerosmith, lead singer, Steven Tyler,

35
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.110
and the song that was part of, I don't want to close my eyes.

36
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.150
I don't want to CO's man,

37
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.130
I don't want to fall asleep cause I miss you, babe, ladies and gentlemen,

38
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.650
Richard Garner. So crooning aside, it was huge. It was a huge movie.

39
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.710
It was one of these massive blockbuster, you know, sort of disaster movies,

40
00:02:45.711 --> 00:02:50.210
but it really put the scenario on the radar of a lot of people about, you know,

41
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.440
what would we do in that? So of course, what do you do here at the old? Uh,

42
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.970
what if headquarters, you asked those questions. What if we blew up an asteroid?

43
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.790
Cause I don't know the answer. Do you know the answer?

44
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.800
I've heard a little bit about it,

45
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:05.770
but I would like to explore it a little bit more.

46
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.500
Would you like to defer to somebody who might know the answer?

47
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.370
I think we have a pretty good guest who might be able to talk about this at

48
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:15.970
length. We happen to have, I think the perfect guest for probably any,

49
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.590
what if hypothetical, but this case in particular, the one, the only bill Nye,

50
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:24.220
the science guy, yes. We were able to get bill Nye, the science.

51
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.550
I love it when he joins us. Well, tell us more about, uh, Pete. Okay.

52
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.370
<v 2>Bill Nye is a scientist engineer, comedian author, and inventor.</v>

53
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.050
He's also a man with a mission to help foster a scientifically literate society

54
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.580
and to help people everywhere,

55
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.330
understand and appreciate the science that makes our world work.

56
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.670
Bill's classic show bill Nye,

57
00:03:47.671 --> 00:03:51.780
the science guy was nominated for 23 Emmys and one

58
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.040
19 and it paved the way for a career in making science

59
00:03:56.041 --> 00:03:58.680
accessible, fun and super cool.

60
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.080
And he's still doing exactly that with his sensationally entertaining and

61
00:04:04.081 --> 00:04:07.440
informative podcast science rules with bill Nye.

62
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.760
<v 1>Well, thanks so much for joining us.</v>

63
00:04:11.761 --> 00:04:15.450
We're super happy to have you on the show today. It's so good to be happy.

64
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.430
Well it's we all love to be had,

65
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.540
but before we get into the sort of the bigger whiff of what,

66
00:04:21.541 --> 00:04:24.330
if we blew up an asteroid, uh,

67
00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:28.470
we were talking off the top boat Armageddon and um, I'm assuming you've seen it.

68
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.310
And B I was thinking about, what is it like to watch a movie with bill Nye,

69
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.870
especially if there's science involved,

70
00:04:33.871 --> 00:04:38.670
because I imagined he'd be pointing out what is sort of a stretch and what

71
00:04:38.671 --> 00:04:39.390
isn't,

72
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.830
if you remember that 1998 classic deep drilling into an asteroid,

73
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.690
was that a even feasible?

74
00:04:45.691 --> 00:04:47.850
And B what did you think of how they handled the science?

75
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.050
<v 0>Well, here's the thing about it. You guys, you don't want to blow it up.</v>

76
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.050
That's the surprising thing

77
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.350
because you probably get a shower of stuff that's on the same trajectory,

78
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.740
uh, as they say, and I'm, I only read about this.

79
00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:09.090
I'm not involved in research,

80
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.480
but Bruce bets at the planetary society is deeply involved in this.

81
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.430
A lot of asteroids, aren't solid rocks. They're in the expression.

82
00:05:17.431 --> 00:05:22.170
The charming expression in astronomy is the rubble piles.

83
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.300
They're just, um,

84
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.280
a loose collection of rocks held together by their mutual gravity.

85
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.110
And uh, so if you set off an explosion explosive near them,

86
00:05:34.111 --> 00:05:36.270
you would just disperse them.

87
00:05:36.271 --> 00:05:40.830
But their overall momentum wouldn't change that much. Like they blow apart,

88
00:05:40.831 --> 00:05:43.440
but they'd still keep coming and they still keep coming at you.

89
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.630
And so it's a very, uh,

90
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.460
it's a very high risk scenario or way to go

91
00:05:50.461 --> 00:05:51.600
about trying to deflect.

92
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.630
<v 1>Because it's rain and rocks basically is what you're saying.</v>

93
00:05:54.631 --> 00:05:58.160
Like basically a bunch of smaller meteorites all over the place.

94
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.800
<v 2>Which would be just as deadly. I'm guessing.</v>

95
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.930
<v 0>Well, maybe, and you know, maybe worse, you know, if, uh,</v>

96
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.190
they land all over the place instead of one place, you know, as we say,

97
00:06:09.191 --> 00:06:11.650
if you like to worry about things, asteroids are great.

98
00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.050
<v 2>Bill. They say NASA, they tell us that NASA is tracking some 20,000,</v>

99
00:06:17.051 --> 00:06:20.730
any owes a near earth objects at any one time. What does,

100
00:06:20.731 --> 00:06:22.390
what does the process look like?

101
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.580
<v 0>And you guys be proud, Canadian space agencies deeply involved in that,</v>

102
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.780
you know, the, uh,

103
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.450
Canadian space agency has an instrument on almost every mission that ever flies.

104
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.340
That's not from Chinese, uh, space administration. So, um,

105
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.650
uh, what you want to do is find a hundred percent of them right now,

106
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.610
people estimate we found about 90% of, well,

107
00:06:48.611 --> 00:06:51.130
that leaves 10% of asteroids.

108
00:06:51.131 --> 00:06:53.800
We don't know where they are and whether or not they're going to cross the

109
00:06:53.801 --> 00:06:56.860
Earth's orbit with us there anytime soon.

110
00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:01.660
So we want to keep watching the skies and finding these

111
00:07:01.661 --> 00:07:06.190
things. Uh, and then, you know, you want 20 or 30 years notice,

112
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.810
so you can do something,

113
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.210
send Bruce Willis or whatever you want to do something to, uh,

114
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.560
keep it from hitting the earth.

115
00:07:14.561 --> 00:07:18.820
And then there's this whole other thing about mitigation where you get everybody

116
00:07:18.821 --> 00:07:22.390
to leave Winnipeg. So if it lands there,

117
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.620
everybody you'll be okay, but this is a very,

118
00:07:26.621 --> 00:07:30.010
these are extraordinary things because the earth is turning.

119
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:34.870
There is going through space and these objects are largely

120
00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:37.540
rock, but many of them also have ice.

121
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.280
And then there's other objects that you don't, you can't see near them.

122
00:07:42.281 --> 00:07:46.030
So their trajectory is pretty predictable,

123
00:07:46.031 --> 00:07:50.830
but there are errors or unknowns on the order

124
00:07:50.831 --> 00:07:53.380
of a few days, or let's say half a day.

125
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:58.780
So is it going to land in Winnipeg or Vancouver or Tokyo

126
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.190
is like, Whoa, you can't really be sure. Oh, the ice will, uh,

127
00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.990
volatize will evaporate, will out gas. That's a good one. Uh,

128
00:08:07.991 --> 00:08:12.760
give the thing a little nudge. So predicting it is, is,

129
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:17.680
uh, difficult to predict it within with the accuracy enough to evacuate cities,

130
00:08:17.681 --> 00:08:21.910
for example, when people have thought deeply about this. And so, uh,

131
00:08:21.911 --> 00:08:25.600
that's why we want to find them all and get ready to give it a name.

132
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.540
<v 1>Yeah, it sounds like the nudge, the deflection is the,</v>

133
00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:31.960
is the way to go and a good hockey, uh, referenced there. The old deflection,

134
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.330
uh, we have a question from our, um.

135
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:34.901
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

136
00:08:34.901 --> 00:08:39.100
the defenseman just puts a stick near it and it goes over the goalies shoulder.

137
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:44.770
<v 1>Um, so we have a hard enough time tracking them right now. Like you said,</v>

138
00:08:44.771 --> 00:08:48.700
90%, there's still 10%. We have all this incredible technology telescopes,

139
00:08:48.701 --> 00:08:51.850
et cetera. And now imagine going back to our poor friends,

140
00:08:51.851 --> 00:08:55.770
the dinosaurs who didn't have that ability, that for warning, uh,

141
00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.000
and we know about that particular existential, uh,

142
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.620
event for them. Uh, we have a question from somebody in the, what if community,

143
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.640
uh, Karthik Narayan asks, what if an asteroid,

144
00:09:08.641 --> 00:09:13.500
the size of one that killed the dinosaurs came close to earth

145
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.000
didn't necessarily hit us,

146
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:18.930
but God let's say within our orbit close enough to affect the moon or us,

147
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.210
is there danger there as well?

148
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:26.900
<v 0>Well, there's a saying in alliterated saying Mrs is good as a mile</v>

149
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:32.720
and mile may not be a reference accessible to many Canadian listeners anymore,

150
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:36.470
but it's, you know, a kilometer and a half that if it misses,

151
00:09:36.471 --> 00:09:41.120
it misses in general, but if it hits it's really bad. So,

152
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:45.010
uh, on my podcast science rules, we had, uh,

153
00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:49.370
uh, jock Jacquelyn, um,

154
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.690
the woman who did the analysis on the crater in off chicks, a loop,

155
00:09:53.691 --> 00:09:57.710
what is now Chick-fil-A Mexico. And the thing came in so fast.

156
00:09:57.711 --> 00:09:58.760
How fast was it?

157
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:04.160
It is supposed that it made the atmosphere into a plasma to

158
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:08.360
assist, to say the atmosphere had got so hot there locally,

159
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:10.550
uh, that, uh,

160
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.350
the electrons dissociate from their atoms and the air became

161
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.820
opaque. Wow.

162
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:22.370
It became so hot that it wasn't transparent to sunlight anymore for, you know,

163
00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:25.160
a few seconds. And then, uh,

164
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:29.810
the wind from it got to what is now France in a few hours.

165
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.890
In other words, the impact was so big. And so, uh,

166
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.900
catastrophic that it affected, uh, the world.

167
00:10:38.901 --> 00:10:41.720
And this is where geologists, you know, when I was in school,

168
00:10:41.721 --> 00:10:43.820
when I was in elementary school, primary school,

169
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.840
nobody really knew what happened to the ancient dinosaurs.

170
00:10:47.841 --> 00:10:51.350
But now everybody's confident in this, that this was the reason,

171
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.920
the cone of the injected material,

172
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:59.210
the ejector was bigger than the diameter of the earth.

173
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.140
Wow. What, yeah. And then, um,

174
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:07.100
this material that we all love so much Iridium,

175
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.020
atomic number 77.

176
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:14.570
So over there Tomic number 77 is all over the

177
00:11:14.571 --> 00:11:17.660
earth because of this impact.

178
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:22.940
And so if it were to hit that's what happens if it were to miss?

179
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:28.550
I mean, not much what happened? You presume if I understand her question,

180
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:34.190
uh, the thing is 30 kilometers across, you know, uh, 20, 20 miles across.

181
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:39.830
And that's huge, but compared to the earth, it's not that big. I mean,

182
00:11:39.831 --> 00:11:40.730
it's not big at all.

183
00:11:40.731 --> 00:11:45.680
I would just go streaking by what didn't do anything

184
00:11:45.681 --> 00:11:49.100
to the gravity of the moon or anything like that. So I was just pondering.

185
00:11:49.101 --> 00:11:52.220
I'm just thinking out loud. I don't think it's big enough. You know,

186
00:11:52.221 --> 00:11:57.160
we had an earthquake what, six years ago that gave the earth access a nudge.

187
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.730
So I'd have to really, it would, I think it's a clear example of it,

188
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.530
but there's no question. Absolutely. It depends. Yeah.

189
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.660
It depends how big the asteroid is,

190
00:12:07.661 --> 00:12:10.660
how fast it literally is going and then how close it came.

191
00:12:10.661 --> 00:12:15.490
But I would imagine it would be measurable, but not sensible.

192
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:16.953
In other words,

193
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:21.730
we have instruments that would measure the gravity deflected deflection due to

194
00:12:21.731 --> 00:12:25.390
its gravity and motion, but a humankind,

195
00:12:25.391 --> 00:12:27.430
a person couldn't feel it I'm imagining.

196
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:32.040
<v 1>Well, we're going to we're first of all, this is great stuff. Uh,</v>

197
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:36.450
we're going to continue with bill Nye to talk about what if we blew up an

198
00:12:36.451 --> 00:12:37.890
asteroid and everything else.

199
00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.090
And also talk about a few other cosmological

200
00:12:42.091 --> 00:12:45.510
scenarios, but, uh, bill there's another podcast.

201
00:12:45.511 --> 00:12:46.770
I want to say a better podcast.

202
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.630
Another podcast that people might be interested in might be better, uh,

203
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:55.080
called science rules with a guy named bill night. Tell us about that.

204
00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:00.960
<v 0>Uh, so it's a, it's a podcast I do, uh, in two versions.</v>

205
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.440
Uh, every week we have somebody on, um,

206
00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:09.930
who was an expert in his or her field talking about something cool. We had,

207
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.080
um, the gala talking about the asteroid impact,

208
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:17.670
this thing when you're under pressure, uh, uh, uh,

209
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.710
Jackleen anyway, talking about the asteroid impact we had, uh,

210
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.960
uh, expert on psychopathy. Wow, you're a psychopath.

211
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.550
She pronounces psychopathy. We have, uh,

212
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.980
we have, uh, every, uh,

213
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:39.870
every two weeks we do a Corona virus edition where we're talking about what's

214
00:13:39.871 --> 00:13:43.110
happening with this pandemic and, uh,

215
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.040
how serious it is and the U S you know, and I, you guys, uh,

216
00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:51.510
as Canadians, I presume you're like everybody else, my colleagues,

217
00:13:51.511 --> 00:13:56.310
I have friends in Denmark and in Japan, they're just shaking their heads.

218
00:13:56.311 --> 00:13:57.480
Like, what are you guys doing?

219
00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.640
And this goes back to the beginning of the U S where just these

220
00:14:02.641 --> 00:14:03.241
systems,

221
00:14:03.241 --> 00:14:08.160
these legal systems were in place that just have real limitations that we're

222
00:14:08.161 --> 00:14:10.740
going to have to overcome in the next election.

223
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:16.020
<v 1>God speed. Yes. Go ahead and speed with that.</v>

224
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.510
Okay. Great bill. Thanks very much for joining us on the video podcast.

225
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.040
We really appreciate it.

226
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.810
<v 0>Thank you for promoting my podcast. Be safe out there.</v>

227
00:14:27.811 --> 00:14:32.520
You all the dangerous world for us right now. We'll do. Thanks Belle.

228
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:34.380
Wow.

229
00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.230
<v 1>So bill Nye, a guy who knows a lot,</v>

230
00:14:37.231 --> 00:14:41.790
also a guy who probably never stops learning doesn't sound like it doesn't know.

231
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.150
And I think you're a guy who likes to never stop learning. Am I right?

232
00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:49.320
Not to the same level of absorption. Let's say as a guy like bill Nye,

233
00:14:49.321 --> 00:14:51.030
the science guy, but yes, I love to learn,

234
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:54.830
love to continue to learn just like we do every week on the show. Well.

235
00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:59.470
<v 2>Now is the time to continue your studies or your learning because you know,</v>

236
00:14:59.471 --> 00:15:01.330
with COVID-19, we're all at home, we got,

237
00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:04.240
most of us have a little bit of extra time to learn. Well,

238
00:15:04.241 --> 00:15:08.230
why don't you become more informed, creative, inspired, relaxed,

239
00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.820
all with the great courses.

240
00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.670
Plus we're really big fans of this aren't we we're sure.

241
00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.210
<v 1>So I was at home the other day and this sounds made up, but it isn't, I'm going,</v>

242
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:18.520
uh, I'm setting up my smart TV cause I just moved.

243
00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:22.150
So I'm going through the apps available on my smart TV. There's our old friend,

244
00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.590
great courses, plus.com.

245
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.730
I'm thinking maybe I could jump in and get prepared for the bill Nye episode.

246
00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.690
Whoo moon rocks. There's a whole episode on moon rocks from the Apollo mission.

247
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:36.580
Uh, this, uh, professor Bob Hazen is talking about this in his words,

248
00:15:36.581 --> 00:15:41.530
the scientific Bonanza that that created 50 years ago when they just came home

249
00:15:41.531 --> 00:15:44.020
with a few rocks from the moon, you'd think, well, that's kind of what is it?

250
00:15:44.021 --> 00:15:47.830
A paperweight? No, they've been actually gleaning tons of scientific info.

251
00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.140
And then all of a sudden, we're talking to bill Nye earlier,

252
00:15:50.141 --> 00:15:54.460
and he's talking about moon rocks and how they've actually helped us understand

253
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.630
what the age of our planet continents here, uh, you know,

254
00:15:58.631 --> 00:16:01.390
minerals and elements in the earth. Like it's incredible.

255
00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.420
The amount of knowledge we've been able to glean from moon rocks and incredible

256
00:16:04.421 --> 00:16:08.770
the amount of knowledge I was able to glean from a great courses plus.com

257
00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:10.630
episode that I was getting ready for this.

258
00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.080
<v 2>Well, let me tell you the great courses, plus has not only that,</v>

259
00:16:14.081 --> 00:16:18.370
but thousands of lectures on almost any topic imaginable from the history of

260
00:16:18.371 --> 00:16:22.540
Egypt to the study of DNA and new courses are added all the time.

261
00:16:22.541 --> 00:16:25.900
There's someone for everyone, not just moon rock lovers like yourself,

262
00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.810
plus every course is presented. Like you say,

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.560
go to the great courses plus.com/ [inaudible].

273
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:11.110
<v 1>I think he meant to say the great courses plus.com/ would've.</v>

274
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:14.800
<v 2>So I think exactly what I said. So let's go there and get your free month.</v>

275
00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.040
So perhaps not surprisingly.

276
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.760
<v 1>Well maybe it was surprising to people listening or watching,</v>

277
00:17:21.761 --> 00:17:24.790
but if you blow up a massive asteroid,

278
00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:29.770
there is that sort of other piece of the puzzle, which is, I don't know,

279
00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:34.180
the trillion pieces of that puzzle that are going to turn into many sort of

280
00:17:34.181 --> 00:17:38.890
media rights. And all of a sudden, it's not raining men, it's raining,

281
00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:43.270
it's still there's maybe the disaster spread out and it's not as

282
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.770
existential in terms of the impact, but you still gonna have massive damage.

283
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:51.900
<v 2>Yeah. And I don't know if it's not going to be as existential. I mean,</v>

284
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.110
bill said it himself, that it could be even worse. You know,

285
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:59.430
don't know what the number would be a million meteors crashing into earth.

286
00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:03.360
Like that would be devastation on all corners of the planet rather than just

287
00:18:03.361 --> 00:18:04.620
concentrated one area.

288
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.880
One thing I didn't know about asteroids is that they're not necessarily one

289
00:18:08.881 --> 00:18:10.430
large rock. Yes,

290
00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:14.520
they are a cluster of much a deal.

291
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:19.040
<v 1>Breathe or whatever, or, but I mean a rubble, I think the word he used,</v>

292
00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:21.500
but it's interesting because really, okay. First of all,

293
00:18:21.501 --> 00:18:24.830
deflection is the only scenario really at the end of the day,

294
00:18:24.831 --> 00:18:28.580
it's rerouting something with whether it's lasers,

295
00:18:28.581 --> 00:18:32.060
whether it's some sort of exp whatever it is, it's not going to be blow it up.

296
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:36.200
It has to be push it off course away from the earth. That's pretty much it.

297
00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:40.850
And again that the lead-up you'd need again, you'd have to know what's coming.

298
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.330
And as he talked about, we know where a lot of them are coming. 90%.

299
00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:45.950
<v 2>We know where 90% of them are.</v>

300
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:50.720
<v 1>Did that, did that reassure you, Peter? That there's 10% that we don't know? Ah,</v>

301
00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.180
no. I was surprised by,

302
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:56.990
I was waiting to hear we know 98.9 and there's

303
00:18:56.991 --> 00:18:59.150
maybe a couple of surprises, 10%. It's a big window.

304
00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:00.530
<v 2>You said it was a big window,</v>

305
00:19:00.531 --> 00:19:05.150
but in just envisioning how large space is like,

306
00:19:05.151 --> 00:19:08.810
I don't blame anybody for missing, missing 10% of the restaurants on the way.

307
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:12.740
<v 1>Not throwing shade at the people man in the telescope.</v>

308
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:16.280
<v 2>And the millennium Falcon going through, uh, a meteor field.</v>

309
00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.630
Can you count all those things?

310
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:19.130
<v 1>No. And I mean, and again,</v>

311
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:23.630
close to that's that incredible piloting skill of Han solo, but no, I mean,

312
00:19:23.631 --> 00:19:26.510
it is interesting that really, this is Sarah that's been talked about.

313
00:19:26.511 --> 00:19:29.000
We talked about it off the top with movies and whatever,

314
00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:32.960
and really it's not feasible because the question marks the downsides,

315
00:19:32.961 --> 00:19:36.950
the risk versus the reward factor too high. It seems like,

316
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:40.070
uh, the, you know, the more you talk about these scenarios,

317
00:19:40.071 --> 00:19:44.300
which get entertained, whether it's through Spotify or whatever else it is,

318
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.690
you realize that yeah, you want to be prepared,

319
00:19:47.691 --> 00:19:49.910
but you can only be prepared for so much. And in this case,

320
00:19:49.911 --> 00:19:54.350
this doesn't seem like going up there with a nuclear bomb and blowing up an

321
00:19:54.351 --> 00:19:56.540
asteroid is even on the table. No.

322
00:19:56.750 --> 00:20:01.460
<v 2>Not at all. Well, if you enjoyed our chat with bill Nye, the science guy,</v>

323
00:20:01.461 --> 00:20:05.900
and want to hear more with him, well, join us in the extended audio version.

324
00:20:05.901 --> 00:20:08.030
Just click on the link in the description below,

325
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:11.510
and we'll have more with bill Nye, the science guy he'll join us.

326
00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:16.370
And we'll talk more about exploding nuclear bombs in space and possible

327
00:20:16.371 --> 00:20:17.630
extinction level event.

328
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.480
<v 0>Yes. The scenarios,</v>

329
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:24.200
the ideas about what to do with an asteroid are just fantastic.

330
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.120
Make your spacecraft so big.

331
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:29.270
How big would it be that it's gravity would,

332
00:20:29.271 --> 00:20:32.120
could be used to tug the asteroid,

333
00:20:32.121 --> 00:20:36.710
a gravity tug ship tug the asteroid off of course, a little bit.

334
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:42.110
Then you mentioned setting off a nuclear weapon in the hopes that the

335
00:20:42.111 --> 00:20:46.550
expanding gases or atoms would give the asteroid a nudge

336
00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:47.973
or give it,

337
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:52.630
set it off so that the material of the asteroid itself would have momentum

338
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.790
to give the asteroid a nudge.

339
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:59.640
<v 2>Lots more interesting stuff with bill Nye in the extended audio version.</v>

340
00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:02.340
We'll see you next time on what if discussed.
