<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.340
<v 1>In 5 billion years,</v>

3
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.840
we're going to have a hefty problem on our hands. Well,

4
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.630
only if we're still living on earth at this point,

5
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.860
our son will be on the brink of collapse.

6
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.550
If we don't find a way to give it all the fuel,

7
00:00:28.551 --> 00:00:31.670
it needs well we're toast.

8
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.080
How could Jupiter help us refuel the sun?

9
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.850
What other stars have consumed gas giants,

10
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.800
and what would life be like without Jupiter?

11
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:48.800
This is what if,

12
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.510
and here's what would happen if we refueled the sun with Jupiter,

13
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.960
the sun's delicate balance of hydrogen and helium keeps us

14
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.890
alive and well,

15
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.810
although you might think there's an infinite ball of energy up there.

16
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.220
I hate to break it to you,

17
00:01:07.221 --> 00:01:12.170
but the sun's not sticking around forever in order

18
00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:16.490
to keep it going. Our son needs a consistent source of hydrogen.

19
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.793
<v 0>At its core.</v>

20
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.600
<v 1>The sun's hydrogen is converted to helium in the process of nuclear fusion.</v>

21
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.230
This fusion reaction is exothermic,

22
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.620
meaning it gives off more energy than it consumes.

23
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.250
This energy is released as gamma radiation,

24
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.980
which provides enough of an outward push of gravity to keep the sun from

25
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.873
imploding.

26
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.500
So how exactly can Jupiter help with all this?

27
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.890
Well, about 90% of Jupiter's atmosphere is made of hydrogen.

28
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.240
This makes it one big ball of fuel,

29
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.720
even though it's only 0.01%.

30
00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:04.520
The mass of the sun astronomers have located a sun

31
00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:09.440
similar to ours that has been eating a Jupiter like gas giant called

32
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.700
wasp 12 B good one science. I hate wasps to

33
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.370
wasp 12 B's atmosphere is being sucked up by its star,

34
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.040
forming a hot ring of gas around it.

35
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.130
As its atmosphere is pulled outward.

36
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.080
This is making the planet puff up to six times the size of Jupiter.

37
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.310
Our son gobbles up hydrogen at a rate of

38
00:02:34.311 --> 00:02:38.180
620 million metric tons per second,

39
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.360
with four gas giants in our solar system,

40
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.130
we could keep the sun sizzling for another 87 million years

41
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.040
with Jupiter being the biggest.

42
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.510
We'd probably want to start there in order to pull this off,

43
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.120
we'd need to set up Jupiter like wasp 12,

44
00:02:56.121 --> 00:03:01.060
be close enough to the sun to deliver a constant influx of hydrogen

45
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:01.960
from its atmosphere.

46
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.540
It would have to be just enough hydrogen so that no mass is added or

47
00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:10.150
lost from the sun. In other words,

48
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.200
like a healthy diet and exercise with an occasional cheat day,

49
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.910
but couldn't, we just smash Jupiter into the sun.

50
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.550
That sounds like more fun to me. Well, this would make for some good fireworks,

51
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:29.380
but this would increase the sun's mass too quickly causing it to burn hot

52
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:32.740
enough to turn global warming into global roasting.

53
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.370
The key is to keep the sun's mass stable.

54
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.370
So it's fusion remains consistent at its core.

55
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.090
Even if we managed to nudge Jupiter close enough to the sun that

56
00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.010
could lead to a whole slew of other problems because without

57
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:55.990
Jupiter's stable, gravitational pull all of our planetary orbits,

58
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.080
including earths would be thrown off course,

59
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.240
and we lose our precious shield against deadly asteroids and

60
00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:07.930
comets. So realistically,

61
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.210
we probably have to suck it up and move somewhere else. Who knows?

62
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.860
Maybe there's a really nice Earth-like exoplanet out there for us to settle.

63
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.380
Let's just hope it's not already populated by hungry aliens,

64
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.530
whatever the scenario is. That's a story for another.

65
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.960
<v 0>What is.</v>
