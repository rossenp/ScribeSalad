00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.770
<v 0>Peter. I noticed you have something in your hand.</v>

2
00:00:01.771 --> 00:00:05.310
There it is the lawnmower 3.0 from manscaped.

3
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.120
And I don't know if you know this about me. I'm not really a beard wearing guy.

4
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:13.020
I've obviously had this for the duration since we've been doing the podcast

5
00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:14.190
since, you know,

6
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.570
I guess it was June when we pretty much got a start on this season. Um,

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.930
but I've only been growing this beard because of the pandemic.

8
00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:22.920
I thought it was a great idea.

9
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.230
Maybe I'd get a chance to grow a beard for the first time in my life,

10
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.890
many COVID beards and many people don't know me as a beard where,

11
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:29.724
and I don't really know.

12
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.810
<v 1>Self has been, I've known you for many years and you were never a beard where,</v>

13
00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:34.850
and I was going to say something. Yeah.

14
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.240
<v 0>Yeah. Well, nobody really. I mean, I don't mind it. Nobody really likes it.</v>

15
00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:39.080
I'm sure. And I've been,

16
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.150
I've been smart enough to keep it trim because I got this lawnmower 3.0 so all

17
00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:45.170
year I've been keeping it trim,

18
00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:48.870
but right now it looks a little bit fuzzy and time to go. Yeah.

19
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.000
So I was going to do this here and give you a show. I know, you know,

20
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:53.834
because you have.

21
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.600
<v 1>I have one and honestly is the best. I mean,</v>

22
00:00:56.601 --> 00:01:01.040
I've had products like that before it is the best shaving product I've ever had.

23
00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:02.210
It's not even close.

24
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.540
<v 0>So I was going to just trim myself up and maybe not show you,</v>

25
00:01:05.541 --> 00:01:08.630
but show everybody else how, uh, how good I'm going to look afterwards.

26
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.390
<v 1>So just to be clear, we will fast forward this. Well, we not,</v>

27
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.070
nobody wants to see this. Okay, great.

28
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.000
<v 0>This is kind of gross.</v>

29
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.850
Yeah. Okay. All right.

30
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.980
So I know this is disgusting.

31
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.990
<v 1>Yeah. In retrospect, uh, maybe take two, you throw down some paper towel,</v>

32
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.470
perhaps.

33
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.720
<v 0>I don't know if there's a take two now, but what do you think? No.</v>

34
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.230
<v 1>There's no question about the shaping quality and you were anywhere thrown it</v>

35
00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:47.540
around. They're pretty loosey goosey.

36
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.880
Not really seemingly worried about cutting.

37
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:50.750
<v 0>And yourself. No.</v>

38
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.890
And you don't need to because it's got the patented blade where it's no, no.

39
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.220
Nicks is what they say about this here. Blade.

40
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.670
I'll tell you what manscaped it provides the best in men's grooming and hygiene

41
00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:05.330

43
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.700

44
00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:16.970
water resistant cordless body tremor, which, uh,

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.380
there advanced skin safe technology and cutting edge ceramic blade makes your

47
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.650
and the kit includes an anti chafing deodorant as opposed to a chafing.

48
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.553
Nobody wants the

49
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.320
chafing odor and nobody wants it.

50
00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.900
It includes the anti chafing deodorant and a moisturizer to help you feel and

51
00:02:38.901 --> 00:02:43.730

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.380
And for a limited time, you get not one but two free gifts. So you get the shed,

54

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.400
the patented high performance. Andy chafing manscaped boxer briefs. Yes.

56
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.610
<v 1>I'm wearing mine right now. You probably are. And you'll have to take my word.</v>

57
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.860
I'm gonna, I'm just gonna have to think you went for it.

58
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.070
<v 2>You can get 20% off plus free</v>

59
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.500
shipping@manscape.com when you use the promo code. What if that's right?

60
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.600
All one word. You still got something over here.

61
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.600
<v 0>I will fix this in the break. Let's get to the show. Okay.</v>

62
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.520
<v 3>The sun formed first and then Jupiter formed out of the leftovers from the sun</v>

63
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.670
and then everything else from that of the leftovers from Jupiter.

64
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.120
So in a really important sense,

65
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.910
if I want to understand where did the earth come from?

66
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.820
I bet to start with where did Jupiter come from?

67
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.350
<v 2>Wow. You really do clean up. Well.</v>

68
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.350
<v 0>Right? I feel so much better, so much lighter. And, uh, you know,</v>

69
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.850
th this is just feels right.

70
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.790
<v 1>Not to be a hater on the beard, but this is the Pete. I know.</v>

71
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.310
<v 0>Thank you. I hope everybody else loves it too.</v>

72
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.840
<v 1>How do you feel about a little game of solar system trivia to this solar system</v>

73
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.850
trivia? Well, why don't we bring the nation?

74
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:09.743
<v 0>I mean,</v>

75
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.040
if there's one thing I probably know a bit about is the solar a bit about as the

76
00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:18.540
solar system working at, what if, you know, half of our videos are set in space,

77
00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:20.100
so I could probably keep up.

78
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.130
<v 1>You think, you know, your way around the solar system, do you.</v>

79
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.790
<v 0>Yeah, enough. I can, I can get there.</v>

80
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.400
<v 1>Okay. Let's get cosmic. Start the insanity.</v>

81
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.140
Where is earth in relation or proximity to the

82
00:04:34.141 --> 00:04:36.630
sun in the sort of order of planets where.

83
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.080
<v 0>Well, this is solar system one Oh one. And, uh, actually, sorry,</v>

84
00:04:40.081 --> 00:04:41.490
it wouldn't really be solar system.

85
00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:44.670
One-on-one I say that only because during the two thousands,

86
00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:49.320
it kept getting rammed in my head. This NBC promo Thursdays.

87
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.330
<v 1>Watch CTV third rock from the sun. Uh, John Lithgow,</v>

88
00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:58.410
Jane curtain, Kristin Johnson, of course the young JGL.

89
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.660
<v 0>Who I think is a great actor and.</v>

90
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.600
<v 1>Joseph Gordon Levitt for the, for the non-conference.</v>

91
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.280
<v 0>I was just saying earlier, I really liked that guy.</v>

92
00:05:05.281 --> 00:05:07.290
I think he would be friends with us for some reason.

93
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.500
<v 1>I would hope that he's a fan of the show. So yes, JGL.</v>

94
00:05:10.501 --> 00:05:15.330
If you are listening GL call us JG. Yes. We'd love to have you on, okay.

95
00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:16.740
Question number two.

96
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.710
What is the smallest planet today in our solar

97
00:05:22.711 --> 00:05:23.544
system.

98
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.820
<v 0>Today? Well, I know where you're trying to lead me down in that pathway,</v>

99
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.640
but here's a little tidbit that you don't, maybe you do now.

100
00:05:29.641 --> 00:05:31.200
Maybe don't know a series.

101
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.900
A lot of people don't know series it's a dwarf planet,

102
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.950
which would technically make it the smallest planet in the solar system.

103
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.320
Although it's not technically a planet,

104
00:05:40.321 --> 00:05:44.160
it's the largest body in the main asteroid field in between Mars.

105
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.860
<v 1>And Jupiter yet to be upgraded to planetary status.</v>

106
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.950
<v 0>So in that case, I would say Pluto,</v>

107
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.550
except for the fact that this is where you were trying to suck me up.

108
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.980
Pluto was downgraded in 2006 odd day for, uh,

109
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.420
for Pluto last planet status.

110
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:01.850
Although there's still a lot of people around the world who are fighting for

111
00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:06.170
Pluto. Yes. Still, uh, the smallest planet then becomes mercury.

112
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.690
Mercury is going as points.

113
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.280
I'm going to tell you mercury just slightly larger than our moon. Hmm.

114
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.080
<v 1>Well, for showing off, you'll be deducted points.</v>

115
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.910
How does that next time just chest, uh,

116
00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.880
finally, what is the largest planet in our solar?

117
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.850
<v 0>I think, uh, every school boy knows that's stupid.</v>

118
00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.860
<v 1>And that is correct. And of course,</v>

119
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.960
most people do know that Jupiter is the biggest planet in the uni,

120
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.960
in the solar system, but not much more than that.

121
00:06:37.961 --> 00:06:42.550
So what if Jupiter never existed?

122
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.610
<v 0>Well, I can tell you, I do know a lot about that. Normally.</v>

123
00:06:45.611 --> 00:06:47.200
I wouldn't know a lot about something like that,

124
00:06:47.201 --> 00:06:50.470
but I did provide the voice for the, what if video?

125
00:06:50.471 --> 00:06:54.850
What if Jupiter never existed? I can, uh, tell you a few things about it,

126
00:06:54.851 --> 00:06:58.570
but it'd probably be smarter for us to have a special guest that might be able

127
00:06:58.571 --> 00:07:00.040
to expound upon that.

128
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.170
<v 1>Like maybe an astronomer from NASA.</v>

129
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.393
<v 0>Why not?</v>

130
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.860
Dr. Steve Levin received his PhD in physics from Berkeley in

131
00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:10.090
1987.

132
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.830
He began his career at NASA jet propulsion laboratory in 1990.

133
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.550
He's the project scientist for NASA's Juno mission.

134
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.250
Juneau is a solar powered space craft,

135
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:24.850
which has been orbiting Jupiter since July 4th,

136
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.000
2016 for a few hours, every 53 days,

137
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.800
Juno passes within a few thousand kilometers of the giant planet and collects a

138
00:07:32.801 --> 00:07:34.870
wealth of new information about Jupiter.

139
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.180
The data collected so far has revolutionized our understanding of Jupiter and of

140
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.860
giant planets in general.

141
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.940
<v 1>Great to have you with us, Dr. 11, thanks for joining us here today.</v>

142
00:07:45.941 --> 00:07:47.320
On what if discussed.

143
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.890
<v 3>My pleasure? It sounds like it's going to be fun.</v>

144
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.430
<v 1>Well, we're going to be talking Jupiter and it's fun.</v>

145
00:07:54.431 --> 00:07:57.400
We'll get to the bigger wood if and a bit, but to be honest,

146
00:07:57.401 --> 00:08:01.930
Peter and I were talking sort of, uh, before you came on that. Yeah.

147
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.820
Most people know that, you know,

148
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.060
Jupiter's the biggest planet in the solar system. Times the size of earth,

149
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.970
11 times the size of earth. I think most people don't know that,

150
00:08:09.971 --> 00:08:14.530
but a good factoid. Um, some people might know that it's a gas giant.

151
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:15.140
I didn't,

152
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.840
I didn't know for years that it was the fifth planet from the sun and that we're

153
00:08:19.841 --> 00:08:23.980
separated, you know, Mars and then Jupiter that close to earth. But I mean,

154
00:08:23.981 --> 00:08:28.540
basically my point is relatively little common knowledge about Jupiter.

155
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:32.920
It didn't feel like we'd been able to do much exploration while the Juno mission

156
00:08:32.921 --> 00:08:36.610
that obviously you're such a big part of has changed the game.

157
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:41.110
How much have we learned about Jupiter since Juno,

158
00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.070
uh, sorta left earth in 2016?

159
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.410
<v 3>So, um,</v>

160
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:52.480
the phrase we like to use around the project is it's a whole new Jupiter. Um,

161
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:57.570
basically we sent Juno Jupiter to measure a bunch of things that hadn't been

162
00:08:57.571 --> 00:09:00.810
measured before to try to peak beneath the clouds, right?

163
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:05.550
Because even though Jupiter, as you said, 11 times bigger than the earth,

164
00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.870
that's the radius. So you'd need, you could fit over a thousand or so inside.

165
00:09:08.871 --> 00:09:13.610
It it's the most massive planet in the solar system by far

166
00:09:13.611 --> 00:09:15.950
more than twice the mass of all the others combined.

167
00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.010
And we've been studying it for hundreds of years.

168
00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.150
Galileo looked at it with this telescope hundreds of years ago. Um,

169
00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.650
even though we have all of that,

170
00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:28.160
mostly we didn't know what lay beneath the clouds.

171
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:32.150
We'd look at Jupiter from the earth and its giant atmosphere and it's covered

172
00:09:32.151 --> 00:09:32.720
with clouds.

173
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:37.460
So we sent Juno there to use gravity to

174
00:09:37.461 --> 00:09:40.730
measure what the interior looks like to measure the magnetic field,

175
00:09:40.731 --> 00:09:44.840
which comes from deep inside the planet to use Ray ATO waves.

176
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.580
They can see through the clouds, uh,

177
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.580
to go over the poles of Jupiter for the first time, really intake,

178
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:53.240
great big choose in the North and South where you can't see it from earth

179
00:09:53.241 --> 00:09:56.120
because it's all in the same plane in the solar system,

180
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.910
a whole bunch of new kinds of measurements,

181
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:03.170
measuring particles in Jupiter's magnetic field, things like that.

182
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:08.060
And essentially everything we measured gave us a surprise

183
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.040
we were looking for. Is there a dense core down in the center?

184
00:10:13.041 --> 00:10:17.900
And sure we expected something between maybe three and 20 times the mass of the

185
00:10:17.901 --> 00:10:19.010
earth down in the center.

186
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.210
But what we found looks like maybe it's not a dense core with a sharp boundary.

187
00:10:23.211 --> 00:10:27.020
Maybe it's sort of fuzzy. And it takes up like half the radius of the planet.

188
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:31.700
We measured the magnetic field and it was way more complex than we expected it

189
00:10:31.701 --> 00:10:33.560
to be with all these bumps and wiggles in it. And,

190
00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:38.300
and it doesn't look like a dipole like your S field and it's way different in

191
00:10:38.301 --> 00:10:39.200
the North than the South.

192
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:44.780
We measured through the clouds with our radio receivers and we found that the

193
00:10:44.781 --> 00:10:49.310
deep atmosphere doesn't get well-mixed the way you'd expect everybody thought,

194
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.000
you know, get beneath the clouds and it's this giant pile of gas.

195
00:10:53.001 --> 00:10:56.570
It should be pretty much the same anywhere you look well, that's totally wrong.

196
00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:01.550
So we got surprises. Every no thing. We took a look at,

197
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.620
even the pictures over the North and South poles,

198
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:07.490
it looks so different than what, the first time we looked at the pictures.

199
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.530
A lot of the people in the room were saying, are you sure of that stupid?

200
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.600
Or it just didn't look at all. Like Jupiter looks like from the side and then.

201
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.120
<v 1>Those pictures have been shared, right. And people can,</v>

202
00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.950
where can people find those pictures.

203
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:23.000
<v 3>Before I forget? Yeah. So there's this great opportunity out there.</v>

204
00:11:23.001 --> 00:11:25.940
So we have a website called mission Juneau, mission,

205
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.670
juneau.swri.edu,

206
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:33.230
but you can get to it from NASA's website or just Google mission Juneau and

207
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:37.400
the Juno cam images. That's the images from our visible light camera.

208
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:42.680
Basically we just dump the raw data out on the web and let anybody who wants

209
00:11:42.681 --> 00:11:46.010
to play with it, make their own pictures, fix up the colors,

210
00:11:46.011 --> 00:11:49.730
stitch things together, however much work you want to do and post them.

211
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.200
And we've gotten an amazing response. Uh,

212
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:58.150
we've there's several people out there who are real power users who would take

213
00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:01.780
that data and turn it into these amazing pictures. Beginning to end.

214
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.370
There's a lot more people who take the intermediate steps and use those and try

215
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.370
stretching the color, changing the contrast,

216
00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:12.460
or combining them to make movies and do some great things.

217
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.340
People are doing science. People are doing art.

218
00:12:15.341 --> 00:12:18.490
People are making pretty pictures. It's really been fun. Yeah.

219
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:22.530
<v 1>I talk about that planet in relation to our planet.</v>

220
00:12:22.531 --> 00:12:26.340
I don't know if everybody knows how much Jupiter may have affected Earth's

221
00:12:26.341 --> 00:12:27.480
development, uh,

222
00:12:27.481 --> 00:12:31.440
among other things it's protected us from a lot of flying rocks, but, uh,

223
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:32.303
what else?

224
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.540
<v 3>Right. So the, the flying rocks thing is basically, uh,</v>

225
00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.230
if you imagine something drifting into the inner solar system,

226
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.090
when it gets near Jupiter's orbit,

227
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:47.460
Jupiter gravitationally is likely to perturb it and a lot more of those get shot

228
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:51.690
outward, then get shot inward so it can protect us. Um,

229
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.830
but more generally just the formation of the whole solar system.

230
00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:00.330
When we look at how did planets form, which by the way,

231
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.760
is something scientists don't really understand all the details about the most

232
00:13:05.761 --> 00:13:10.500
important models for how does the source system form, how do we get the planets?

233
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:16.080
Um, indicate that Jupiter came first, uh, not too surprising,

234
00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:17.760
cause it's the largest it got there. First,

235
00:13:17.761 --> 00:13:21.990
it got all the material and then it affected the formation of the whole rest of

236
00:13:21.991 --> 00:13:25.590
the solar system. So there's, there's lots of ways to think about that.

237
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:30.870
But the one I liked the best is if you just look at our solar

238
00:13:30.871 --> 00:13:32.550
system, like you were an alien or something,

239
00:13:32.551 --> 00:13:37.140
and don't know what's there you'd come along, you'd see the sun. And you'd say,

240
00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:38.910
maybe that's it. That's all there is,

241
00:13:38.911 --> 00:13:42.600
is this star and you'd be 99 and a half percent, right.

242
00:13:42.601 --> 00:13:44.760
Or something because almost all the masses in the sun.

243
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.820
And then if you looked a little bit further and said, Oh wait,

244
00:13:47.821 --> 00:13:52.650
I see that spec that's Jupiter, right? You'd be more than two thirds.

245
00:13:52.651 --> 00:13:53.400
Right? If you said,

246
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.400
that's all that's left because Jupiter's more than two thirds of the remaining

247
00:13:56.850 --> 00:13:57.870
mass. Well,

248
00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.850
the sun formed first and then Jupiter formed out of the leftovers from the sun

249
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.000
and then everything else from that of the leftovers from Jupiter.

250
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.450
So in a really important sense,

251
00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.270
if I want to understand where did the earth come from?

252
00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.090
I better start with where did Jupiter come from?

253
00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.370
Otherwise I'm never going to get the picture.

254
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.430
<v 1>So the,</v>

255
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:23.070
I guess the short answer to what if Jupiter never existed would be

256
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:24.960
earth wouldn't have existed.

257
00:14:24.961 --> 00:14:27.600
And I'm guessing the rest of the solar system wouldn't have existed.

258
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:28.651
<v 3>Well,</v>

259
00:14:28.651 --> 00:14:33.360
I love that question because it's actually way more complicated than it sounds.

260
00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:38.460
So imagine when you asked me that question,

261
00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:40.350
the first thing I thought of is, okay.

262
00:14:40.351 --> 00:14:45.090
Imagine Jupiter just didn't start to look for what would happen. Well,

263
00:14:45.091 --> 00:14:49.710
the answer there is probably one of the other planets would have gotten a whole

264
00:14:49.711 --> 00:14:52.010
lot bigger and sort of like Jupiter,

265
00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:57.710
because if you look at the other really big ones at Saturn and Uranus and

266
00:14:57.711 --> 00:14:58.520
Neptune,

267
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:03.290
what we think most likely happened is as the planets

268
00:15:03.291 --> 00:15:04.790
formed, they drifted around.

269
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:08.900
Cause they're eating up the material and that makes the initial cloud of gas and

270
00:15:08.901 --> 00:15:10.550
dust, and that changes their momentum.

271
00:15:10.551 --> 00:15:15.320
And so their orbits shipped around and those other planets probably came

272
00:15:15.321 --> 00:15:20.240
along after Jupiter was really big, Jupiter altered their orbits dramatically.

273
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:24.560
It looks like it probably sent them outward away from the sun and

274
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.020
they didn't have as much stuff.

275
00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.450
Jupiter ate all the stuff first before they could get there.

276
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:31.100
So if Jupiter wasn't there,

277
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:35.240
well maybe Saturn drips in further and Saturday to all the stuff and looks a

278
00:15:35.241 --> 00:15:39.860
whole lot like Jupiter does now of course, exactly where they ended up,

279
00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:43.010
depends on all of that process. So if you take Jupiter out of the mix,

280
00:15:43.011 --> 00:15:46.670
you totally rearranged things. Maybe we get a giant planet close to the sun,

281
00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.420
or maybe we don't get a giant planet planet anywhere near the sun.

282
00:15:50.421 --> 00:15:52.190
And there's really big ones out far away.

283
00:15:52.191 --> 00:15:57.050
And we only have little planets close to the center or six of them or 10 of them

284
00:15:57.051 --> 00:15:59.600
instead of eight or nine. Um,

285
00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.390
all of that would be different if Jupiter didn't form.

286
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:08.060
And on top of that rattle, if you say, okay, suppose Jupiter forum,

287
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:09.680
do we got all the planets in the right place,

288
00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:14.960
but now I'm going to just reach in and pop Jupiter out of the picture and say,

289
00:16:14.961 --> 00:16:19.100
what happens? Then you get a totally different kind of answer, right?

290
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.680
The other planets don't get perturbed that much anymore,

291
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.560
but anything that's falling into the inner solar system,

292
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.760
light comments and asteroids, uh, mostly, really small rocks.

293
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.270
Maybe you wouldn't call them asteroids, meteors, things like that.

294
00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.560
Without Jupiter there, they don't get returned their same way.

295
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:40.040
Their orbits are very different Mars. Isn't big enough to do much of anything.

296
00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:43.100
So then you worry about, well, we get hit by comments more often,

297
00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:47.720
or if you clucked Jupiter out of the picture after everything formed,

298
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:51.320
but before everything had settled down, then you'd get a different answer.

299
00:16:51.321 --> 00:16:54.530
Maybe the amount of water on the earth might be different because Jupiter

300
00:16:54.531 --> 00:16:59.150
probably influenced that. So any step along in the process,

301
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.340
if you don't have Jupiter, you get a different picture,

302
00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.180
but what picture you get depends on when you took Jupiter away.

303
00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.140
<v 1>It's funny because these days, you know,</v>

304
00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:11.110
more people are talking about how interconnected things are here,

305
00:17:11.111 --> 00:17:15.430
how we have to be reminded that even though there's seemingly a lot of distance

306
00:17:15.431 --> 00:17:18.580
between Austin and the other side of the world, and in fact,

307
00:17:18.581 --> 00:17:21.220
everything has this sort of butterfly effect,

308
00:17:21.221 --> 00:17:24.070
if you will and affects everything else. So it's, it's,

309
00:17:24.071 --> 00:17:26.170
it's interesting to see that that's the case.

310
00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:30.430
Obviously the further we zoom out into the solar system as well,

311
00:17:30.431 --> 00:17:35.110
you mentioned a smaller rocks, uh, and uh,

312
00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.980
these days, of course, the moons around Jupiter, I think,

313
00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.850
especially in this sort of astronomical circles, uh,

314
00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:46.390
are getting as much attention, maybe even as Jupiter, uh,

315
00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:48.700
especially Europa Ganymede, et cetera.

316
00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:53.340
What Juno been able to sort of glean more about Jupiter's

317
00:17:53.341 --> 00:17:54.174
moons?

318
00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:56.181
<v 3>Okay.</v>

319
00:17:56.181 --> 00:18:01.100
So first I should say our most important jobs so far about

320
00:18:01.101 --> 00:18:03.410
Europa has been to stay the heck away.

321
00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:05.720
<v 1>From it. And that's.</v>

322
00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:10.700
<v 3>Because people are very excited about the fact that Europa appears</v>

323
00:18:10.701 --> 00:18:13.370
to have a liquid water ocean underneath its icy Sur

324
00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:19.520
and maybe find life in that ocean. So picture 20, 30, 40,

325
00:18:19.521 --> 00:18:20.660
50 years from now,

326
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:25.850
you finally built a system that can do it and you fly to Europa and you land

327
00:18:25.851 --> 00:18:28.220
on the ice and you dig down beneath the ice.

328
00:18:28.221 --> 00:18:30.890
And we don't know whether that's a few feet or a few hundred miles,

329
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.850
but you dig through the ice, we get into the water, you sample the water,

330
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.880
you find life. And then you have to say,

331
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:42.080
but I don't know if that came from Europa or contamination for when Juno hit it

332
00:18:42.081 --> 00:18:42.914
50 years ago,

333
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:48.830
that would be a problem because we're there to study Jupiter.

334
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.780
We have to be better.

335
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:54.920
And we didn't go through all the steps you do for say a Mars mission to make it

336
00:18:54.921 --> 00:18:58.880
as clean as possible and have no bacteria on it or anything like that.

337
00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.500
Nothing that could survive.

338
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.140
We have to show we're not going to contaminate Europa.

339
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.110
And what we did at the beginning is we said, all right, well, we're,

340
00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.450
they're going to study the, the main planet, not Europa.

341
00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.920
We'll just stay the heck away from however we're coming near the end of our

342
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:17.750
prime mission. We're writing actually sending it in today.

343
00:19:17.751 --> 00:19:21.530
I think an extended mission proposal to NASA to ask,

344
00:19:21.531 --> 00:19:25.610
to keep giving us money to continue because the spacecraft's doing well.

345
00:19:25.611 --> 00:19:28.490
And we have lots of great new science we can do.

346
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.160
And part of that proposal,

347
00:19:31.161 --> 00:19:34.400
which of course NASA will have to decide if they have the money.

348
00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:39.440
Part of that proposal is to study Europa because we think

349
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:44.600
with our radio receivers, um, that we use to look at the atmosphere,

350
00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:48.770
we can look at Europa and tell you something about maybe how thick the ice is

351
00:19:48.771 --> 00:19:51.530
and whether there's water near the surface. Um,

352
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:54.950
we have other instruments that if we're lucky,

353
00:19:54.951 --> 00:19:59.240
maybe we'll see a plume and be able to tell something about whether Europa has

354
00:19:59.241 --> 00:20:01.340
geysers are not sticking out in this space.

355
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:04.280
We can look at all the other satellites.

356
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:08.420
And I would not give that as a SUNY.

357
00:20:08.421 --> 00:20:10.850
It gets funded as a, um,

358
00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:14.960
like prime mission that studies the satellites because that's not what we were

359
00:20:14.961 --> 00:20:15.591
there for,

360
00:20:15.591 --> 00:20:20.240
and we're not geared to do everything you want to do to study Europa,

361
00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:24.680
but it's a great advanced scout mission for NASA's mission,

362
00:20:24.681 --> 00:20:25.610
Europa clipper,

363
00:20:25.611 --> 00:20:30.290
or European mission Jews that want to go to Jupiter and study those moons and

364
00:20:30.291 --> 00:20:31.124
learn a lot more.

365
00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:34.820
We can learn a little bit that might help them refine where they do their

366
00:20:34.821 --> 00:20:36.350
measurements and what they do.

367
00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.980
We can measure some things that they weren't designed to measure because they're

368
00:20:39.981 --> 00:20:43.310
focused on, on stuff that is more Europa specific.

369
00:20:43.311 --> 00:20:45.740
And we have instruments that were really focused on Jupiter.

370
00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.710
So we measure slightly things.

371
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.340
There's lots of great stuff we can do if we get,

372
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.880
if NASA decides that they want to fund our extended mission or has the money to

373
00:20:54.881 --> 00:20:55.870
fund the extended missions.

374
00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.170
And if it includes your own breaking news here on what F.

375
00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.720
<v 0>Yeah. Yeah. Um, to say that this is the golden age of space,</v>

376
00:21:03.721 --> 00:21:07.110
exploration would be an understatement. We're talking about the Juno mission.

377
00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.900
NASA launched a probe to Mars earlier this year.

378
00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:13.080
We got the announcement last week and we had a guest on talking about the

379
00:21:13.081 --> 00:21:17.220
possibility of phosphene on Venus and what that might spur in terms of further

380
00:21:17.221 --> 00:21:20.850
exploration. What is it like to be working at NASA these days?

381
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:24.060
<v 3>I got to say it's really fun. I mean,</v>

382
00:21:24.061 --> 00:21:28.140
I I've been working for NASA one way or the other for about 30 years.

383
00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:30.330
And, um,

384
00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:35.190
it's always been fun because we're exploring where trying to figure out

385
00:21:35.191 --> 00:21:37.980
things where nobody knows the answer. Um,

386
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:42.660
but right now we're getting close to some really important answers. Uh,

387
00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:45.660
we're learning, you know, it's, it's in my lifetime,

388
00:21:45.661 --> 00:21:50.280
in my career as a scientist is, you know, at the beginning of my career,

389
00:21:50.281 --> 00:21:53.670
nobody had discovered any planets around any other star besides our own.

390
00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.600
Now it's practically practically root Chino.

391
00:21:57.601 --> 00:21:59.460
They found another planet around some other star.

392
00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.250
And it's only interesting if it's a special case,

393
00:22:02.251 --> 00:22:05.400
if it's more Earth-like or it's really close to its star,

394
00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:08.130
or really far from its star or things like that,

395
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.130
we're getting distributions of bath.

396
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.750
We're learning how many planets there are typical plea,

397
00:22:12.751 --> 00:22:13.590
and there's our own solar system.

398
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.890
We're learning about different ways to look for life within our own solar

399
00:22:16.891 --> 00:22:20.040
system. And we're getting further along doing it.

400
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:24.960
Our robots have gotten so good that we can launch robotic spacecraft and do

401
00:22:24.961 --> 00:22:29.850
these exploration things that, you know, when I was growing up, I thought only,

402
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.910
you know, you'd have to have people there to do. And of course,

403
00:22:32.911 --> 00:22:37.890
it's way easier to send a robot than it is to send a person mostly because the

404
00:22:37.891 --> 00:22:40.380
robot doesn't care if you bring, give it a ride home.

405
00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:43.890
So all of that,

406
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.920
it's really a great time to be doing space exploration.

407
00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:50.190
<v 1>Yeah. And I mean, with the way the world is these days,</v>

408
00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:54.210
I know Peter and I have experienced this before that when we get to talk to

409
00:22:54.211 --> 00:22:55.770
people like yourself that, you know,

410
00:22:55.771 --> 00:23:00.300
help us zoom out and remind us that the world isn't our little navel

411
00:23:00.301 --> 00:23:04.500
gazing day to day, that there's just obviously so much beyond this planet.

412
00:23:04.501 --> 00:23:05.580
So much to look forward to,

413
00:23:05.581 --> 00:23:10.230
and even so much to be optimistic about the future versus all the dystopian

414
00:23:10.231 --> 00:23:13.440
sci-fi and post-apocalyptic stuff. I think we see a lot.

415
00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:17.460
It's easy to forget that. So this is great. Can you stick around and talk?

416
00:23:17.461 --> 00:23:20.700
You mentioned some of those exoplanets and kind of future NASA missions.

417
00:23:20.701 --> 00:23:22.710
Can you stick around for a bit? Sure.

418
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:27.570
So we w we are going to take a break with Dr. Levin right now,

419
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:32.490
and he will be part of the extended audio podcast, which you can find,

420
00:23:32.491 --> 00:23:35.100
I guess if you're watching YouTube goods, the link is where people.

421
00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:37.560
<v 0>Listen, if you're watching this on YouTube right now,</v>

422
00:23:37.561 --> 00:23:41.040
you want to click on the link and you'll get the extended audio version of the

423
00:23:41.041 --> 00:23:44.940
podcast, and we can hear the rest of the conversation with Dr. Levin. Um,

424
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:48.140
but if that's all the time you have for us today, then, uh, well,

425
00:23:48.141 --> 00:23:48.950
that's fine too. You can,

426
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:51.170
you're going to stick around because we're still gonna do a little video chat

427
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:54.050
after this. Um, and then we'll check in.

428
00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:57.400
<v 1>Part two later. Yeah. So Peter now sort of sum up our,</v>

429
00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:00.130
our takeaways from the first half, where can people,

430
00:24:00.131 --> 00:24:04.720
you mentioned the website for the, for the footage, uh, from the Juno mission,

431
00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:08.800
where can people find that again and where can people follow your work?

432
00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.600
<v 3>So, um,</v>

433
00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:14.710
the easiest thing for people to remember is if you go to NASA's website and

434
00:24:14.711 --> 00:24:18.250
search for Juneau, you'll find out all this stuff with links to everything.

435
00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:22.870
But the main Juneau website is a site called mission Juneau. So it's mission

436
00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:29.320
juneau.swri.edu. And if you just Google mission Juneau, you'll find it.

437
00:24:29.321 --> 00:24:33.430
Or if you do a web search for Juno cam, you'll find us, um,

438
00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.353
it's pretty easy,

439
00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:39.070
just so long as you got NASA or Jupiter or something in there to keep from

440
00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:41.200
getting confused with all the other Junos out there.

441
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:45.610
<v 1>I like the Juno awards up here. Google will get you there, basically,</v>

442
00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.250
which honor the best of Canadian music you don't want.

443
00:24:48.251 --> 00:24:51.040
That's an entirely different Juno. Yes.

444
00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:54.190
Dr. Levin will do on that site too. It's pretty interesting.

445
00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:57.940
I think Alanis Morissette one in Juneau back in the day as, as Alanise,

446
00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:02.470
but that's a story for another whatever. Okay. Dr. Levin sit tight.

447
00:25:02.471 --> 00:25:05.140
We'll be back with you in a sec. And, uh, Peter and oddly,

448
00:25:05.141 --> 00:25:09.040
back to sort of sum up our takeaways from our conversation with Dr. Levin about

449
00:25:09.041 --> 00:25:12.400
the Juno mission and what if Jupiter never existed?

450
00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:14.643
Cool.

451
00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:19.600
So I guess like Dr. Lebanon and the people at the jet propulsion laboratory

452
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:23.530
with NASA, uh, they learn stuff. We learn stuff.

453
00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:27.460
They learned that some of the things that they had assumed or known about

454
00:25:27.461 --> 00:25:30.430
Jupiter turned out not to be true or, or,

455
00:25:30.431 --> 00:25:34.810
or were at least more than they had expected. Of course,

456
00:25:34.811 --> 00:25:38.360
because they got to finally actually look at it from the quality pictures,

457
00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:39.340
quality picture.

458
00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:39.761
<v 0>There's deeper.</v>

459
00:25:39.761 --> 00:25:43.570
So they got to go beneath the gas surface and see what's happening down there.

460
00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:48.040
<v 1>Had some assumptions about it. But in fact, we're, I think happily proven wrong.</v>

461
00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:53.740
<v 0>I like when a NASA does some things like that and we find</v>

462
00:25:53.741 --> 00:25:58.000
out about it and we can bring it to the viewers. It's almost that fast. I mean.

463
00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:00.010
<v 1>Well, I mean, in this particular case,</v>

464
00:26:00.011 --> 00:26:02.860
you're having some real time learning going on, because again,

465
00:26:02.861 --> 00:26:06.040
he's giving us the sort of the backstory as to what they learned at the time.

466
00:26:06.041 --> 00:26:07.150
And then we're learning that into,

467
00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:10.360
to your point then people listening or watching or learning. I mean,

468
00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:12.880
I learned also that we have this sort of big brother,

469
00:26:12.881 --> 00:26:15.670
big sister relationship with Jupiter on earth, right? I mean,

470
00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:20.530
it's been essentially shielding us protecting us for all this time.

471
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:24.070
And I had never, honestly, before I know it sounds stupid maybe,

472
00:26:24.071 --> 00:26:26.440
but I'd never thought that, you know,

473
00:26:26.441 --> 00:26:29.770
all that sprays debris and asteroids coming in this direction would have

474
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:33.280
naturally potentially hit us if we weren't kind of protected from that.

475
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:39.430
<v 0>Well, we know, what I thought was interesting was that if Jupiter, he gave us a,</v>

476
00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:43.170
an idea of how the universe was formed. Jupiter obviously was, or not.

477
00:26:43.171 --> 00:26:45.120
Obviously we learned today or I learned today,

478
00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:48.120
it was the second object in the solar system.

479
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.540
And if it hadn't been there or if it wasn't there,

480
00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.610
if there's a possibility earth wouldn't be here. Right?

481
00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:58.010
<v 1>Yeah. So it's not a small relationship we have with Jupiter.</v>

482
00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.760
And what if Jupiter never existed as it turns out again,

483
00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:04.550
as we sort of put it out there, if Jupiter never existed,

484
00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.280
there's the possibility that earth never existed.

485
00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:11.840
But he also added a bit of a, sort of a caveat to that,

486
00:27:11.841 --> 00:27:14.060
that whoever else would have been there,

487
00:27:14.061 --> 00:27:16.610
they might've gotten that say the leftover mass.

488
00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:21.050
So maybe in a different scenario, earth would have been the size of Jupiter.

489
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:25.850
And instead of having 7 billion people here we'd have 700 billion people here.

490
00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:28.490
<v 0>Or maybe it wouldn't have, uh,</v>

491
00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.090
stayed in the habitable zone or maybe it would have gotten too big and that

492
00:27:32.091 --> 00:27:34.190
wouldn't have been enough water on it to sustain life.

493
00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:38.390
There would have been a whole host of other reasons why maybe life didn't exist,

494
00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.470
never came to be on.

495
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:41.630
<v 1>Earth. You know what it sounds like to me, Peter, it.</v>

496
00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:46.520
<v 0>Sounds like a story for another. What if, well, uh,</v>

497
00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.910
if you want to hear more of our conversation with, uh, NASA, Steve Levin,

498
00:27:49.911 --> 00:27:53.330
and you're watching the video podcast on YouTube, well,

499
00:27:53.331 --> 00:27:57.290

some of you are listening already on the audio podcast.

502
00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:08.180
There's no link for you. Don't look for anything, stay tuned now.

503
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:11.720
So join us on the other side, we'll talk more about life on other planets and,

504
00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:16.730
uh, and, uh, space exploration, a bunch of ration Europa.

505
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:20.690
Um, and if that's all the time you have for us today, well, thanks for watching.

506
00:28:20.691 --> 00:28:22.580
You can join us next week.

507
00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:27.050
When we talk about the mysteries of the octopus with the director of the film,

508
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:31.130
my octopus teacher, you won't see an octopus in the same light ever again.

509
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:35.060
<v 1>No, I mean, they're fascinating. That's why that movie has blown up on Netflix,</v>

510
00:28:35.061 --> 00:28:38.960
my octopus teacher. And it'll be really cool to get some insight.

511
00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:43.880
What if has done a couple of octopus or PI videos and pusses, uh,

512
00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:46.130
but, uh, this is going to be a really cool conversation.

513
00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:49.730
<v 0>Right? That's next week on what if discussed.</v>
