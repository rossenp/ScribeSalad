00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.510
<v 0>The most deadly predator of the sea spent at state conquering and</v>

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.240
terrorizing every creature in sight.

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.680
This is the megalot Dawn.

4
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.370
It lived millions of years ago,

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.390
but let's assume this muster shark was alive today.

6
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.060
And instead of worrying about other creatures in the sea,

7
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.900
this Megalodon, he's now coming for you,

8
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.950
how would the Megalodon hunt you down?

9
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.280
How could your size be your best advantage and

10
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.470
how could you survive this attack?

11
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.530
This is what if,

12
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.000
and here's what would happen if you were attacked by a Megalodon

13
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.520
Megal add-ons are a force to be reckoned with estimates.

14
00:00:56.521 --> 00:01:00.030
Show that they grew up to 18 meters long.

15
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.730
This is three times longer than the largest great white shark ever

16
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:06.564
recorded,

17
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.480
not dimension that their jaw could open up to three and a half

18
00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:13.470
meters wide.

19
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.900
So do you think you stand a chance with this beast? Well,

20
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.190
let's find out

21
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.850
if you happen to find yourself swimming in the ocean and a Megalodon is lurking

22
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:29.760
about you might actually be okay.

23
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.890
There's a chance that since your so small compared to its other prey,

24
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.220
the Megalodon wouldn't think you're worth eating.

25
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.280
They instead go for the blue whale or a pack of great white sharks for some

26
00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:45.114
real meat.

27
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.160
But just because you're a puny human doesn't mean you'd be safe

28
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.420
from the Megalodon.

29
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.330
After all the Megalodon was so huge and needed so much energy that it

30
00:01:57.331 --> 00:01:59.700
would take any more. So the food, again,

31
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.380
it's estimated that the Megalodon ate nearly 1200

32
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.870
kilograms of food every day.

33
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.280
But instead of having you swim in the middle of the ocean,

34
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.550
let's give you a chance by putting you on a boat.

35
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.490
And even with this newly added equipment, you still run into some issues.

36
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.070
Being on a boat would be much faster, but now you'd be much easier to spot.

37
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.450
And the Megalodon could now use its signature move.

38
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.520
It hunted the majority of its prey by using sneak attacks from below.

39
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.950
And now with you on your boat,

40
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.540
it would naturally be doing the same thing to you with its

41
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.580
34 metric ton body.

42
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.530
It would Ram your boat from underneath flipping and destroying it with your

43
00:02:49.531 --> 00:02:53.760
boat. Completely wrecked. You'd be in the water with the mega Dawn.

44
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.560
<v 1>Now hungry for your blood.</v>

45
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.970
<v 0>And speaking of which, if you happen to get a cut during this process,</v>

46
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.080
the Megalodon would be able to spot you with its keen sense of smell.

47
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.410
Just like sharks. When a Megalodon smells,

48
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:13.240
blood hit aims to kill no amount of people,

49
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.590
noise or anything else threatening the Megalodon would be able to stop its

50
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.140
thirst for blood. Add this point,

51
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.300
your best bet would be to remain calm and start swimming to shore or

52
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.373
another boat.

53
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.270
This is another opportunity where your small size can be used to your advantage,

54
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.180
depending on which ocean you're in. You could hide between coral reefs,

55
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.030
where the Megalodon would be unable to reach you.

56
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.880
And if you made it to shallow waters,

57
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.980
then your chances of survival would be even better since the Megalodon

58
00:03:49.981 --> 00:03:53.040
was so massive. It wouldn't be able to maneuver.

59
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.280
<v 1>Around the shallow waters, eventually forcing.</v>

60
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.410
<v 0>It to lose interest in you and retreat.</v>

61
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.410
But realistically, if you were anywhere.

62
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.940
<v 1>Near this massive beast.</v>

63
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.540
<v 0>You'd quickly become it's food. I mean, come on. It's the Megalodon,</v>

64
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.600
this thing was one of the deadliest predators of all times.

65
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.130
I wonder if there's anything that could defeat it in a battle to the death,

66
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.800
maybe the Moses sore,

67
00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:30.600
but that sounds like a story for another, whatever.
