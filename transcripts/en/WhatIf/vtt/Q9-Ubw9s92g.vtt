00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.630
<v 0>Where did COVID-19 come from something</v>

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.420
it originated in this Wu Han wet market

3
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.860
while others think it comes from bats,

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.620
but could it be possible that COVID-19 was made in a

5
00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:20.454
lab?

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.130
Is it true that COVID-19 is an engineered virus

7
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.360
or did it accidentally escape?

8
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.300
This is what if,

9
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.340
and here's what would happen if COVID-19 was made in a lab?

10
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.040
The lab that COVID-19 could have escaped from is the Wu Han

11
00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:45.840
Institute of virology.

12
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.640
This lab deals with some of the most dangerous viruses in the world.

13
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.920
And if it did happen, it wouldn't be the first time for one of these labs.

14
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.020
The SARS virus escaped from a high level containment labs in Beijing,

15
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.220
multiple times,

16
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.800
but is this lab really where COVID-19 came from?

17
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.040
Well,

18
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.900
first let's talk about why people think COVID-19 originated at this lab.

19
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.420
The first COVID-19 case was initially found in this Wu Han wet

20
00:01:20.421 --> 00:01:21.254
market.

21
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.570
And since this wet market is just 12 kilometers from the Wu Han virology

22
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:27.404
center,

23
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.390
this lab is really the only one in question not to

24
00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:37.070
mention that it's the global epicenter of Corona virus research in bats.

25
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.240
Since it's suspected, COVID-19 came from bats,

26
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.280
there's been speculation that the virus could have been engineered and then

27
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.590
accidentally escaped from the building.

28
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.040
And if the world were able to confirm that this actually happened,

29
00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.410
the consequences would be pretty scary relations

30
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:04.940
between China and the rest of the world could start to get incredibly

31
00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:05.774
hostile.

32
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.570
But hopefully we don't need to worry about COVID-19 starting any Wars

33
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.980
that's because no COVID-19 was not made in a lab.

34
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.960
And it didn't find a way to mysteriously sneak out of the virology

35
00:02:20.961 --> 00:02:21.794
center.

36
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.270
The Wuhan Institute of virology was looking for something similar to

37
00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:30.080
COVID-19, a bad disease that was harmful to humans.

38
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.080
If researchers found anything like that,

39
00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:36.350
they would have published their scientific results immediately.

40
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.560
They wouldn't have waited for it to escape from their labs.

41
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.620
And it was originally reported that the first cases of COVID-19 happened

42
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:49.310
in the Wu Han wet market, but that might not be the case.

43
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.830
It was later determined that the first cases had no connection to the animal

44
00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:55.664
market.

45
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.420
So it is possible that someone outside of Wu Han contracted the

46
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:06.310
virus and brought it into the animal market where it would be easy

47
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:11.200
for the virus to spread. But that doesn't mean that any of this was intentional.

48
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.870
It's safe to say that COVID-19 was not genetically engineered.

49
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.730
If it were,

50
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.890
there would be signs of manipulation in the genome data and thousands of

51
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:28.060
scientists all around the world have looked at the genome of the virus and

52
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.580
haven't found any evidence of engineering.

53
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.050
If there had been any tampering, it would be pretty obvious.

54
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.340
Scientists wouldn't need to create their own backbone for the DNA,

55
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.620
which can be detected pretty quickly. Not only that,

56
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:49.390
but being able to create a virus that spreads disease is nearly

57
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:50.224
impossible.

58
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.390
That's because scientists don't know enough about what makes a virus

59
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:56.560
pathogenic just yet.

60
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.470
And viruses are extremely complicated in order to be able to

61
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:07.150
manufacture what scientists would need to perfectly construct every

62
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:08.860
single molecule in the virus.

63
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.310
Just one tiny aspect of the virus altered,

64
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.680
and it could end up wildly different.

65
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.930
So it's safe to say that COVID-19 was not made in a lab.

66
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.700
The Spanish flu in the 19 hundreds scientists have predicted that humanity will

67
00:04:26.701 --> 00:04:28.770
go through another worldwide pandemic.

68
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.320
As humanity destroys natural habitats and makes contact with wildlife.

69
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.160
It becomes more likely that we'll contract diseases from them.

70
00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.570
And instead of blaming China or other countries,

71
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.380
maybe we can take this opportunity to look at it ourselves.

72
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.630
Maybe countries can use this as a reminder to invest in things like public,

73
00:04:51.631 --> 00:04:52.464
the health care,

74
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.060
more hospitals paid sick leave and the protection of wildlife,

75
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.580
because with the way the world operates, pandemics are almost inevitable.

76
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.790
You just need to figure out a better way of handling them.

77
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.650
One way would be for everyone in the world to wear masks,

78
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.530
but we'll leave that story for another. What if.
