00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.070
<v 0>Imagine an ultimate road trip across the globe on a</v>

2
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:08.670
highway along the equator. Wait,

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.180
there there's no highway along the equator yet.

4
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.480
So how about we build one?

5
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.220
What would it take to construct the longest road on earth?

6
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.590
How long would you spend behind the wheel to complete this Epic journey

7
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.330
and why would building this highway upset?

8
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.280
Environmentalist's this is whatev and here's

9
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:39.300
what would happen if we built a road around the world,

10
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.560
there are about 64 million kilometers of all kinds of roads around

11
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:47.394
the globe,

12
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.620
but no single highway network that can take you from New York directly

13
00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:53.454
to Cape town.

14
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.370
The hypothetical freeway that we're about to build would easily take you from

15
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.950
Columbia all the way to Indonesia,

16
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.610
combine that with some of the existing road systems,

17
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.710
and you might just be able to drive anywhere in the world,

18
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.510
but that would be a very expensive engineering achievement,

19
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.460
because a big part of this highway would have to be constructed

20
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.290
underwater.

21
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.120
On average, it takes about five to 10 years to build a highway,

22
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.930
but we wouldn't be building just any highway.

23
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.060
We're aiming for a 40,000 kilometer long two lane

24
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.890
Ecuadorian road to construct it in about the same

25
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.020
timeframe as a normal highway,

26
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.980
we need to be working on different parts of it all at the same time,

27
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.460
our globe spanning highway would require about 8 million skilled workers

28
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.410
and some $9.2 trillion to build. Yeah,

29
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.660
those are some whopping numbers to consider.

30
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.800
And what would it be like to drive on it?

31
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.560
I'd say it's pretty cool.

32
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.300
The equator cuts through 13 countries and three oceans.

33
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.640
Let's say you start in South America in Ecuador and travel East through

34
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.290
Colombia to Brazil.

35
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.960
You'd be enjoying a humid tropical climate and very high temperature.

36
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.790
So make sure your cars,

37
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.490
air conditioning is working before you leave for the trip.

38
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.980
You'd be passing over mountains and the Amazon river.

39
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.070
And if you decided to go for a refreshing swim,

40
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.850
remember that the Amazon's full of bloodthirsty.

41
00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:47.610
Paranas waiting to eat you in a matter of minutes.

42
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.080
Just joking Paranas are actually calm scavengers.

43
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:55.440
So you can go for a swim at your own risk.

44
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.060
Your Amazonian would just be the beginning.

45
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.310
You would soon reach the Atlantic coast of Brazil and you'd be about to enter

46
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:08.380
the first underwater stretch.

47
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.300
The great Atlantic tunnel and the view here is,

48
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.160
Hm.

49
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.993
<v 1>Rather doll.</v>

50
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.490
<v 0>Finally, there's land. After days of travel,</v>

51
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.110
you would make it to Africa.

52
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.720
You'd be driving through the Savannah's Swampson dense rainforest of

53
00:03:30.721 --> 00:03:35.160
Gabon and Congo and into the deserts of Kenya and Somalia

54
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.500
on your way. You might see elephants, gorillas, buffaloes,

55
00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:41.730
and leopards,

56
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.320
and that would make the long trip through the tunnel kind of worth it.

57
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.930
But then you run out of land and you enter another underwater

58
00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:55.350
tunnel this time. It's the great Indian.

59
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.393
<v 1>In tunnel.</v>

60
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.380
Oh, I see.

61
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.213
<v 0>And again,</v>

62
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.830
it's Indonesia with it's 17,000 islands scattered around the

63
00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:08.664
equator.

64
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.890
You'd be driving through a series of short tunnels to cross from one Island to

65
00:04:13.891 --> 00:04:17.250
another. And every time you got back on land,

66
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.560
the scenery would be majestic, volcanic landscapes,

67
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.380
rice fields, tropical rainforests.

68
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.790
I bet you could use a day at the beach after such a long drive.

69
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.660
Okay. It's time to move on to the next town.

70
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.180
The great Pacific tunnel.

71
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.010
Is it just me or is this one like three times longer?

72
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.580
No, this is the longest underwater stretch of the entire trip.

73
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.800
And by the end of it,

74
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.630
you'd have a little bonus in the form of the last exciting spot of the highway.

75
00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.610
The Galapagos islands,

76
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.680
a showcase of evolution where the most unusual forms of life are

77
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.480
thriving in the wild, a feast for the eyes. After that long drive,

78
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.900
then you would drive a little further through one last short underwater tunnel

79
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.210
and end up right where you started in Ecuador. Hey, congratulations.

80
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.280
You made a road trip around the globe traveling at

81
00:05:26.281 --> 00:05:27.840
100 kilometers per hour.

82
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.150
You'd spend some 400 hours or about 17 days

83
00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:36.330
at the wheel. 12 of those days,

84
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.370
you'd be stuck inside a tunnel under the ocean with some breaks for the

85
00:05:41.371 --> 00:05:44.610
night rest and sometime to enjoy the sights.

86
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.440
The entire travel time would add up to at least two months.

87
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.350
Hope you can afford such a long vacation,

88
00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.680
but as much fun as this idea sounds,

89
00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.970
it would be an enormous hit on the planet.

90
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.340
The construction of the highway itself would disrupt ecosystems,

91
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:06.380
both on land and in the ocean.

92
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.740
On top of that during this Epic trip,

93
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.110
your car would emit almost twice as much carbon dioxide as the average

94
00:06:15.111 --> 00:06:16.790
car does in a year.

95
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.950
Looks like we'll never see a highway like that running along the equator.

96
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.860
Maybe we could start building flying cars that would require a different type of

97
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:28.790
highway altogether,

98
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.800
but that's a story for another.

99
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:42.670
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>
