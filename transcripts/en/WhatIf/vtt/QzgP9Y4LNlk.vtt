1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.080
<v 0>I was spelling the word biosphere down the phone to people.</v>

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.810
People didn't know what a bias fear is.

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.940
And so bias fear put not just the word

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.410
bias fear in our lexicon, but the concept,

5
00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:21.090
the idea of what a bias fear is. And, you know, that's a,

6
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:26.040
that's a hugely important and transformative idea for humanity that we now

7
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.040
have, you know, the short form, our global biosphere.

8
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:31.980
I think we all basically have a general understanding of what that means now.

9
00:00:31.981 --> 00:00:33.570
And you can really think buys for two for them.

10
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.900
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

11
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.910
<v 2>Talk about isolation a lot on the show.</v>

12
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.110
It seems like a once every third show. Yeah. We've talked about it.

13
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.940
And in relation to space like the international space station, Stanford,

14
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.970
tourists too, in a smaller respect and, uh, maybe even on other planets,

15
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.750
Mars space, colonization exoplanets as well.

16
00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:09.290
We've also talked about it in relation to this planet,

17
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.610
because we've talked about living in isolation during a pandemic. Uh,

18
00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:17.110
we talked about seasonal affective disorders that has it all sort of pertained

19
00:01:17.111 --> 00:01:21.590
to that lockdown era that, you know, we're in now. And,

20
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.470
uh, you know, there's multiple ways to sort of imagine what that

21
00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:29.840
scenario would be like. Yeah, well, unfortunately,

22
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.130
it's gone from imagining to us to real world scenarios said, yeah,

23
00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:37.340
we know more than we've ever known about isolation,

24
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.200
but we still don't know what it would be like to live in a

25
00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:44.090
closed bias sphere. You know,

26
00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:48.800
who knows that there's some people there's very few people on this planet who

27
00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:51.050
actually know the answer. Well,

28
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.340
how many have lived in a closed bias fear for two years,

29
00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.420
eight people,

30
00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.430
and one of them is joining us today and her name is Jane Poynter Jane. Perfect.

31
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.150
Welcome to what if discussed? Well.

32
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.220
<v 0>Hello dad, gentlemen, it's.</v>

33
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.840
<v 2>Been a while, obviously since,</v>

34
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:12.080
and you were such an integral part of obviously not just, you know,

35
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.140
participating in the biosphere two project,

36
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.990
but also being part of the design, uh,

37
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.520
leading up to it and really the legacy work after a lot

38
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.820
in terms of the, you know, where that science is being applied now.

39
00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:29.330
But I guess the first place to start, I know it's a such a big question,

40
00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:30.530
but what,

41
00:02:30.531 --> 00:02:34.910
what was your experience in biosphere two?

42
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.750
<v 0>So maybe it might be helpful before we talk about how I</v>

43
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.150
experienced living in biosphere too,

44
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.440
just to sort of set the table a second and let everybody know what buys for two

45
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.540
ears was. Right.

46
00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:54.890
So I was on the design team of this sounds very grandiose,

47
00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:55.730
but it's true.

48
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.850
We were on the design team of humanity's first attempt to creating the

49
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:03.310
world's first human made biosphere, right?

50
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:06.460
So we all live in a biosphere that's biosphere, one be us,

51
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.650
and we were attempting to create biosphere to the first other

52
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:12.340
biosphere.

53
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.260
And so it was a three acre and still is it's still going today and is run by

54
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.060
university of Arizona. Uh,

55
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.110
it's a three acre enclosed environment that was completely sealed back in the

56
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:25.240
day. It was, was sealed when I was in there tight,

57
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.460
tighter than the international space station.

58
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.660
So there was essentially no air exchange without side.

59
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.180
And so all of the plants inside the rainforest, the Savannah, the ocean,

60
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.710
the mosh, the desert,

61
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.760
and the farm while creating all of our oxygen, you know,

62
00:03:42.761 --> 00:03:45.310
we were creating some of the CO2 for all the ponds.

63
00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:48.970
And so everything was recycling inside and we drank the same water over and over

64
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:52.810
again and read the same oxygen over and over again.

65
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.090
So one of the incredible things about being

66
00:03:58.091 --> 00:04:02.590
inside biosphere two was that experience.

67
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.270
It was that experience of being viscerally part of my bias fear

68
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.100
and really understanding what it is to have a finite bias fear.

69
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.390
And for eight people buys two was pretty small, uh,

70
00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.710
and it turns out that's very akin to the kind of experience that astronauts have

71
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:24.370
when they see the, from space. They see the auth from the outside in,

72
00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:28.900
so they see the boundaries of this planetary biosphere that we all inhabit

73
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.790
and they too have a similar experience of Holy cow. ROS is not that big.

74
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.160
So I was, it was an amazing experience. It was also very hard because, you know,

75
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:43.120
as you were talking about in the intro being isolated is not necessarily the

76
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.050
easiest thing.

77
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.980
<v 3>No, that's, and that's what I think we're talking about.</v>

78
00:04:46.981 --> 00:04:49.350
And you just mentioned with ASP astronauts,

79
00:04:49.351 --> 00:04:52.950
I would think are the most isolated people, but after that,

80
00:04:52.951 --> 00:04:57.150
this is a huge isolation, but, uh, to go into something like that, really,

81
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.010
you know, you really have to have a courage and,

82
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.180
and some sort of sense of an Explorer's curiosity. Obviously you had that.

83
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.820
Why do you think you were so willing to do this?

84
00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.130
<v 0>So it had nothing to do with being wailing. It was like I had to do it.</v>

85
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.470
I was on the design team.

86
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.180
And so was I seriously going to let somebody else go in and test this out of

87
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.090
I had to go in and it was also the closest thing I ever thought I would get to

88
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.000
Mars. So for me,

89
00:05:27.001 --> 00:05:31.830
this was almost like going in and testing a prototype space space as if we were

90
00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:36.750
on Mars. And my favorite place to be was sitting on the beach that we had

91
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.710
looking out the incredible windows that were everywhere.

92
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.040
And we were in the Arizona desert, sunset,

93
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.730
the mountains around us turned red. And so for all the worlds we were on malls.

94
00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:51.510
So I, for me, it was living out this extraordinary live stream of,

95
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:52.623
of going to mosque.

96
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.880
<v 3>And it's interesting you say that because I think not everybody,</v>

97
00:05:56.881 --> 00:05:57.890
but a lot of people.

98
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.140
<v 2>That, you know, I've talked to about this, you know,</v>

99
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:03.830
they seem to remember or equate biosphere too, with, you know,

100
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.210
in an environmental ecological endeavor, which of course it was, again,

101
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:11.420
a lot of the science, a lot of the recycling, all those things, but in the end,

102
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.950
the impetus was what would it be like to live on another planet?

103
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.730
So that was really something that was, you know,

104
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.010
let's say ahead of its time, at the time,

105
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.030
over the course of the last X amount of years, Jane, you know,

106
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:29.870
you see movies like the Martian I could go on and on in the Spotify world,

107
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.970
how much and how, I don't know, what,

108
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.070
what's it been like for you to watch these people sort of apply some of those

109
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:42.050
things in pop culture and Saifai going forward as it relates to living on other

110
00:06:42.051 --> 00:06:42.884
planets?

111
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.980
<v 0>Well, I absolutely loved the Martian. Uh,</v>

112
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.810
it was very true to life. I mean, as I was watching it, I was like, aha,

113
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.750
that's right. That's what I'm thinking.

114
00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.850
<v 2>People are watching that movie going well, that's absolutely accurate or that.</v>

115
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.381
<v 0>Well, you know,</v>

116
00:07:02.381 --> 00:07:06.010
and of course they also did a really good job of getting scientific input into

117
00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:09.250
what he was writing. So that was also very cool and it was very apparent.

118
00:07:09.251 --> 00:07:12.310
So I absolutely loved it. And it's thrilling. So look, I've been in,

119
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:17.050
in the human space flight world, my entire adult life.

120
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.640
Uh, and you know, I thought back in the day when we were advisory to,

121
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:26.020
we would be well on Mars by now. Uh, and at the time America,

122
00:07:26.021 --> 00:07:30.910
I did have a plan to go to Mars, but, you know, as we know plans change.

123
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.530
So, uh,

124
00:07:32.531 --> 00:07:36.730
what's been super exciting is to really see what's going on with commercial

125
00:07:36.731 --> 00:07:41.290
space and, you know, that that's really taking off, uh,

126
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.190
in such a huge way. You know, it's sort of almost an overnight success.

127
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.790
That's been many decades in the making. Uh, so it's,

128
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:53.620
it's very exciting to see that, you know, and I think what's, uh,

129
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.720
what's super interesting and relevant about

130
00:07:58.721 --> 00:08:03.400
space flight and human space flight is that it has this really unique

131
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.100
power to inspire, right?

132
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:10.120
There's really few other things that I think really capture the world in its

133
00:08:10.121 --> 00:08:14.620
entirety and, and, and get people excited as spaceflight does.

134
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.550
You know, and, and I, we were talking a second ago about astronauts and,

135
00:08:18.551 --> 00:08:23.290
and their experience of seeing us from space and one of the things that

136
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.890
I'm really drawn by as these sort of huge ideas.

137
00:08:26.891 --> 00:08:28.900
And so the huge idea of being able to give,

138
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:31.510
being able to give as many people to see all from space,

139
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.060
it's incredibly important because, you know,

140
00:08:34.061 --> 00:08:37.390
with all of these extraordinary global challenges that we have right here in

141
00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:38.500
biosphere, one,

142
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.570
how important is it that we are based in a global perspective?

143
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.180
So I think this, uh, human space flight,

144
00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:48.790
whether it's where to biosphere eventually, or, you know,

145
00:08:48.791 --> 00:08:51.370
the kind of spacecraft that we see with the international space station is

146
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.480
really, really important.

147
00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.900
<v 2>There are a few years ago I interviewed, uh, the late great, uh, Edgar Mitchell,</v>

148
00:08:57.901 --> 00:09:02.670
six men to walk on the moon. Cool. He, you know, obviously, as you would think,

149
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:04.890
right, somebody who's an astronaut back in the day, well,

150
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:08.130
what what's their background usually are they're science people,

151
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.610
they're military people they're rigid. I don't want to say rigid,

152
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:13.710
but you know what I mean? There's structure not hippies.

153
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.990
Let's just say that right. Discipline. Well,

154
00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:19.920
he comes back from having that experience and he,

155
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.660
I'm sure you're familiar with this Jane,

156
00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:24.180
but he articulates what Jane's talking about.

157
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:29.370
It transformed him to see the like,

158
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.340
and I don't mean just like he I'm going to no,

159
00:09:32.341 --> 00:09:37.110
he means he felt rewired from seeing the earth on its

160
00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:39.420
own. I mean, other astronauts have talked about that,

161
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.050
but it actually changed the entire course of his life after that he started the

162
00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:47.790
Institute for Noetic sciences and he, he talked about it almost like a,

163
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.980
almost like a religious experience, Jane.

164
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.810
<v 0>Yeah. So actually that's very common. Uh,</v>

165
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:57.830
and now we're beginning to see what I will loosely say of sort of

166
00:09:57.831 --> 00:10:02.360
quantifying what happens to people who go to a space and have this

167
00:10:02.361 --> 00:10:07.250
experience. And I think, uh, you know, I'm paraphrasing, but th there's the, um,

168
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:08.390
commentary that, you know,

169
00:10:08.391 --> 00:10:12.650
we're going to space to explore space and instead we just gotta be us, uh,

170
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.420
and on what happens.

171
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.900
And now you can see it actually changes behavior.

172
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.530
Literally it changes people's behavior. You know,

173
00:10:21.531 --> 00:10:26.210
like me going into bias for two, I was all about space. I'm going to Mars.

174
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:29.540
That's my only focus environment who cares. And, you know,

175
00:10:29.541 --> 00:10:33.230
when I came out of the biosphere, I was like, Oh, wait a minute. Yes,

176
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.960
I'm the vice Varian too. We're all Biospherians of planet UF,

177
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.250
and we should care. And it's important. And what you'll see with, uh,

178
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.490
astronauts, when they go to space, it's very similar. They go up,

179
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.000
maybe they're involved in, you know, some social activities,

180
00:10:47.001 --> 00:10:48.740
a little bit of environment when they come back,

181
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:54.020
it's just historically significant increase in the amount of interaction

182
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:58.430
they have with the communities on how involved they get with environmental and

183
00:10:58.431 --> 00:11:00.710
social causes of, of many kinds.

184
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:05.510
It really is striking how it impacts us as a

185
00:11:05.511 --> 00:11:09.230
human to get that place,

186
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.320
understand our place in our global biosphere.

187
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.690
<v 2>So I guess all we need is to get everybody into space.</v>

188
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:19.100
<v 0>Hey, that's what I'm working on, but that's okay.</v>

189
00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.710
<v 3>You were lucky enough to go and experience that.</v>

190
00:11:21.711 --> 00:11:23.540
So that's obviously your perspective.

191
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:28.100
There are many other perspectives on the success of biosphere too, but, uh,

192
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.690
like a lot of things with the benefit of time,

193
00:11:29.691 --> 00:11:34.190
we see more and more the value of what we learned from biosphere two, uh,

194
00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.650
as it helps guide other projects and science. And,

195
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.700
but what do you think is the most important legacy of biosphere two?

196
00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:42.283
<v 0>So of course there's,</v>

197
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.940
there's many aspects of science

198
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.260
that, uh,

199
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:53.000
biosphere two has directly impacted and climate

200
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.040
science and bio J over, uh, cycling, uh,

201
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.820
all kinds of particular science about understanding how our planet works.

202
00:12:00.821 --> 00:12:03.310
But when I really boil it down, you know,

203
00:12:03.311 --> 00:12:08.140
one of the things that we have to remember is putting biosphere two

204
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:09.910
in its historical context.

205
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:14.230
So we were designing bias for two in the 1980s.

206
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.860
And I went inside in 1991, you know,

207
00:12:17.861 --> 00:12:21.220
there was barely an internet. You know, people were hardly, you know,

208
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.080
you've got to really put yourself back there, right.

209
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.090
I was spelling the word biosphere down the phone to people.

210
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.850
People didn't know what a biosphere is.

211
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.980
And so bias fear put not just the word

212
00:12:35.981 --> 00:12:40.400
bias fear in our lexicon, but the concept,

213
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:45.100
the idea of what a bias theory is. And, you know, that's a,

214
00:12:45.101 --> 00:12:50.050
that's a hugely important and transformative idea for humanity that we now

215
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.050
have, you know, the short form, our global biosphere.

216
00:12:53.051 --> 00:12:55.990
I think we all basically have a general understanding of what that means now.

217
00:12:55.991 --> 00:12:58.330
And you can really think buys for two for that. Yeah.

218
00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.530
<v 2>Yeah, absolutely. And there's so much more, I mean, I'm,</v>

219
00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:06.780
I'm sort of boiling over here with questions because I'm really wanting to get

220
00:13:06.781 --> 00:13:10.890
into the experience of being there, but also, you know, the social aspect of,

221
00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:14.130
of eight people, all the other things, the oxygen issue.

222
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.250
Can you stick around Jane for a few more questions?

223
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.710
<v 0>Sure. No problem. So, excellent.</v>

224
00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.290
<v 2>We'll follow up with Jane on the audio version.</v>

225
00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.740
