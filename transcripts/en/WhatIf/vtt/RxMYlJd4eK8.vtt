<v 1>I ran a Saurus Rex King of the title.</v>

<v 0>Lizards.</v>

<v 1>Meters, tall, 12 meters long,</v>

5
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.390
and it weighs upward of seven tons.

6
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.410
You can hide from it. You might even be able to outrun it.

7
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:26.660
<v 0>But do you.</v>

8
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.790
<v 1>Really want to do this every day?</v>

9
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.720
What would it be like to live with T-Rex would

10
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:40.430
we keep them in zoos? Would we eat them in restaurants?

11
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.730
Would we wear them on our backs or would we live in

12
00:00:46.731 --> 00:00:49.070
constant fear of being chomped.

13
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.650
<v 0>Or tramp is.</v>

14
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.880
<v 1>Use? What would happen if T-Rex were still alive?</v>

15
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.810
Roughly 66 million years ago,

16
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.730
a massive asteroid thought to be about 15 kilometers wide,

17
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.070
hit the earth with an impact equal to several million nuclear

18
00:01:13.071 --> 00:01:15.140
bombs detonating at once.

19
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.150
This triggered the sudden mass extinction of approximately

20
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.680
75% of all plant and animal species on the planet

21
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.080
among them was the most powerful terrestrial predator to have ever lived.

22
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.150
The Tyrannosaurus Rex as one of the most popular

23
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.733
prehistoric animals.

24
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.810
Being able to see a T-Rex in the flesh is a pretty common fantasy,

25
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.170
but what if we got what we wished war and T-Rex

26
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.730
were still alive today,

27
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.440
would humanity be able to survive alongside them

28
00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.740
were T-Rex as vicious and as ruthless as they appear to be in

29
00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:01.970
movies and TV,

30
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.970
or would these massive dinosaurs be more worried about us

31
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.860
than we'd be of them? If T-Rex were alive today,

32
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.050
chances are they'd be an endangered species. They're terrifying.

33
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:22.850
Reputation would be no match for the habitat loss pollution and

34
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.560
food shortages caused by humans because of this T-Rex

35
00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:32.150
populations would be a lot smaller and it's even possible

36
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.150
that they would have evolved to be a smaller size.

37
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.460
We'd probably have to keep them in sanctuaries similar to a wildlife

38
00:02:40.461 --> 00:02:45.320
Safari since letting them roam freely would be bad for both T-Rex

39
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.750
and humans in the wild.

40
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.630
A T-Rex would have to look out for hunters,

41
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.670
poachers who want the thrill and the bragging rights of taking down a

42
00:02:55.671 --> 00:02:57.050
seven ton beast.

43
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.680
But even if you were smart enough to keep your distance a hungry,

44
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.000
T-Rex looking for food might find itself stumbling onto a farm or

45
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.980
breaking into a city zoo.

46
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.920
And if you can't imagine a rampaging two wrecks storming around your

47
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:15.754
city,

48
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.950
just imagine an upright bus with two legs and sharp teeth

49
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.570
that have a maximum bite force of about 5,800 kilograms,

50
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.830
but it's not like T-Rex would always be out hunting humans.

51
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.280
Scientific evidence suggests that T-Rex,

52
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:36.610
might've been more like scavengers than predators.

53
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.690
Unlike most predators that tend to have super sharp vision,

54
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.080
a T-Rex his eyes were small and weak.

55
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.810
This dinosaur also had unusually small arms compared to the rest of their body,

56
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.320
which wouldn't have been very effective for fighting prey.

57
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.180
However,

58
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.980
T-Rex did have unusually large olfactory lobes as part of their

59
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:00.814
brains,

60
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.590
which scientists think would have been helpful for smelling rotting carcasses

61
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:06.490
from far away.

62
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.670
But that same powerful sense of smell might also draw T-Rex

63
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.940
to country ranches or urban meat factories,

64
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.460
which would almost certainly end in disaster.

65
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.130
A T-Rex could eat up to 230 kilograms of meat in just

66
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:28.690
one bite. So your farm animals wouldn't last very long.

67
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.060
And if you wanted to defend them or simply prevent your house from being

68
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:38.650
crushed, you wouldn't be able to take on a T-Rex without a gun.

69
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.260
And if he didn't have one,

70
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.440
you'd have to run for your life directs.

71
00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:49.120
Weren't super fast runners with some scientists believing their top speed

72
00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:51.250
was around 16 kilometers an hour.

73
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:56.230
So if you ran and hid in a dense forest where it would be hard for them to

74
00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:58.300
maneuver, you might be safe.

75
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.570
You could also try to trip the T-Rex.

76
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.980
That's chasing you since they're top heavy dinosaurs that had a hard time

77
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.300
getting up. If they fell, of course, we wouldn't have to worry about anything,

78
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.170
your livestock and outsmarting T-Rex.

79
00:05:13.171 --> 00:05:16.980
If we kept them safely confined to wildlife preserves,

80
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.750
we could create large habitats for them and grow food to feed them

81
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.390
so that appetites wouldn't get them or us into trouble.

82
00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.610
The sanctuaries probably wouldn't look like anything from Jurassic park since

83
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.100
well, we've seen how well that works,

84
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.340
but maybe with enough space food and under proper management,

85
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.100
humans could coexist with T-Rex,

86
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.840
but the T-Rex is just one type of dinosaur.

87
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.720
Could we live with others too?

88
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.730
What do you think the world would be like if none of the dinosaurs ever went

89
00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:57.564
extinct?

90
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.020
<v 2>Well, that's a story for another. What if.</v>
