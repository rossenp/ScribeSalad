00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.470
<v 0>This podcast is brought to you by bespoke Post's box of awesome.</v>

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.380
<v 1>Everything you can imagine doing in the vicinity of our son, for example,</v>

3
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.330
like having various objects in orbit around it, essentially,

4
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.110
uh, you know, for billions of years, you can do that with a black hole as well,

5
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.670
just because the black hole is there.

6
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.020
It doesn't mean that it's some big vacuum cleaner. That sucks things in.

7
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.830
<v 2>Pete. I know, you know, a little bit about black holes.</v>

8
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.720
<v 0>I do because on what if every eight third video,</v>

9
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.830
every third video? Yeah, we do a lot of black hole videos here,

10
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.240
but that speaks to.

11
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.140
<v 2>The fact that tons of people are fascinated with black holes.</v>

12
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.501
<v 0>Yes,</v>

13
00:00:54.501 --> 00:00:58.220
it's a fascinating subject because most people know nothing about them other

14
00:00:58.221 --> 00:01:01.640
than their one black than they're a black hole, that sucks stuff into them.

15
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.280
<v 2>And as we'll find out in today's show,</v>

16
00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:08.120
there's going to be some myths and misconceptions about black holes that will be

17
00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:12.110
answered because a lot of the things we think we do know are starting to change,

18
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.660
but that's why we have guests like physics professors on the show to be able to

19
00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:22.520
help us sort out things like what if our solar system orbited a black hole

20
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.260
today, we're going to be joined by USC professor of physics, Clifford Johnson,

21
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.380
but first some good news for the,

22
00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:32.450
what if discussed community.

23
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.960
<v 0>Well that's right. Uh, this fall, as you get back into the swing of things,</v>

24
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.970
bespoke post has a brand new seasonal box of awesome collection for guys

25
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.550
guaranteed to upgrade your life. Uh,

26
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.420
this month I got the aged box and that's a kit that lets me barrel age,

27
00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:50.510
my spirits at home. And when I say spirits, I mean liquors,

28
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.120
which lifts your spirits. Sometimes there it does.

29
00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:55.370
I'm pretty excited about an aging, some gin right now,

30
00:01:55.371 --> 00:01:59.540
and your age it for 10 days, and today is day 10. So I'll let you know.

31
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.020
<v 2>Oh my box of awesome. A couple of things.</v>

32
00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:06.140
I was torn between the gadget thing that, you know, I live in a condo.

33
00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:09.710
So anything that can sort of check the boxes on a million different tool

34
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:13.190
applications is great, but I ultimately, the travel bag is super cool.

35
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.690
Cause I'm somebody who likes to,

36
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.570
if I'm going away for like 10 days or a hundred days,

37
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.950
I want to carry on in that sense.

38
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.560
<v 0>That one, but I haven't been traveling anywhere lately.</v>

39
00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:23.180
Thanks to you all so true. Yeah.

40
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.440
Whether it's geared to upgrade your autumn craft beers or cozy threads for when

41
00:02:27.441 --> 00:02:28.274
the temperature dips,

42
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.450
bespoke posts only sends guys the best stuff every month,

43
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.730
no matter what you're into box of. Awesome.

44
00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:38.600
Has you covered from style and grooming goods to barware cooking tools and

45
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.550
outdoor gear box of awesome has collections for every part of your life to get

46
00:02:43.551 --> 00:02:46.580
started, take the quiz@boxofawesome.com.

47
00:02:46.581 --> 00:02:49.850
Your answers will help them pick the right box of awesome for you.

48
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.510
They release new boxes every month across a ton of different categories.

49
00:02:53.511 --> 00:02:57.650
Like I said, it's free to sign up and you can skip a month or cancel any time.

50
00:02:57.651 --> 00:03:01.990
So no, a real commitment. Each box costs only 45 bucks,

51
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.360
but has over 70 bucks worth of gear inside.

52
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.040
I've got a bunch of extra money these days from not spending cash on gas or

53
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.770
transit. So 45 bucks seems quite reasonable,

54
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:13.990
especially when you get double the value. Yeah. Yeah.

55
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:17.110
You get 20% off your first monthly box when you sign

56
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:20.410
up@boxofawesome.com and enter the code.

57
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:24.130
What if at checkout that's box of awesome.com code?

58
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.850
What if all one word for 20% off your first box?

59
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.530
<v 2>So let's get started. And again, like we talked about off the top black holes,</v>

60
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.390
you and I, a superficial knowledge at best again, that's why,

61
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.200
uh, we like to have experts on the show to help us understand in this case,

62
00:03:43.201 --> 00:03:47.490
what if our solar system orbited a black hole? I don't really know the answer.

63
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.740
I'm pretty sure you don't know the answer. So we're joined by again,

64
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.710
professor of physics from the university of Southern California,

65
00:03:55.711 --> 00:03:56.730
Clifford Johnson.

66
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.950
<v 3>Hi, great to be here.</v>

67
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.740
<v 2>Uh, professor, thanks for joining us. Uh,</v>

68
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.240
it sounds like a simple question to start, but it, we might as well go there.

69
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.830
What is a black hole?

70
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.270
<v 3>Well,</v>

71
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.190
that is something that does come into various of these fields

72
00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:14.730
in a way,

73
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.560
because we think about the nature of space and time and

74
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.200
a black hole is fundamentally something very,

75
00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:26.760
very fundamentally different about space and time that we had thought that that

76
00:04:26.761 --> 00:04:31.590
had been thought of until the last, um, uh, century, uh,

77
00:04:31.591 --> 00:04:35.680
of, of, of work in great detail. And what it is we,

78
00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:40.620
we understand in general is simply a region of

79
00:04:40.621 --> 00:04:43.920
space where for whatever reason,

80
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.780
the gravitational pull is so strong that not even light

81
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.380
can escape from it in the sense that, you know,

82
00:04:52.381 --> 00:04:57.150
if we wanted to get off this body here earth, uh, we, we, we send,

83
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.730
we send rockets away, uh,

84
00:04:59.731 --> 00:05:03.090
into space and we do that by getting up to a certain speed,

85
00:05:03.091 --> 00:05:06.600
a certain escape velocity, which allows you to excrete escape,

86
00:05:06.601 --> 00:05:09.900
the gravitational pull and, uh,

87
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.490
for reasons that we, we could go into, but, but let's not for now, uh,

88
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.380
there's a, there's a fastest possible speed that you can do in this universe.

89
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.150
It's the speed of light. So if you had a body that was so, uh,

90
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.920
gravitationally strong that the escape speed was faster than the speed of light,

91
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.480
then nothing would be able to escape from it. And that's what a black hole.

92
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.910
<v 0>There's, there's various, uh, levels of black hole. As I understand it,</v>

93
00:05:37.911 --> 00:05:41.220
it's kind of like the Wendy's drive through there's your regular black hole and

94
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.720
there's their super massive black hole.

95
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.090
<v 2>Medium, a triple a double what's the difference.</v>

96
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.490
<v 0>Between a regular and a supermassive black hole?</v>

97
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.430
<v 3>Well, one of the amazing things about black holes is that they are, uh,</v>

98
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.580
by some definitions, very, very complicated. And by other definitions,

99
00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:02.930
they are the simplest objects in the universe that we've ever

100
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:07.610
encountered in, in, in physics. Uh, and so in some ways,

101
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.170
the only difference between those different kinds of black holes that you talk

102
00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:13.370
about is how big they are.

103
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.290
And so you have black holes that are say,

104
00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:22.790
have roughly a few times the mass of our sun because they come

105
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:26.480
from stars that have, in some sense died,

106
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.170
they've gone to a new phase of existence where they're no longer glowing like

107
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:33.560
stars and they collapse and they form this compact object.

108
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.390
And so they have a mass that is essentially related to the stuff that

109
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:42.860
collapsed. Um, but then you have regions of space, uh,

110
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.530
for example, at the core of most galaxies,

111
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.870
where there are black holes that are huge hundreds

112
00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:54.620
of millions of times, the mass of a typical star.

113
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.180
And in some sense,

114
00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.380
they're very closely related to those smaller kinds of black holes.

115
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.720
And there are also intermediate mass black holes,

116
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.160
and some of us speculate that they may also be microscopic black holes, uh,

117
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.080
as a possibility of nature as well.

118
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:14.110
<v 2>All shapes and sizes, yes. A kid's meal. Um, one of the,</v>

119
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:18.550
I guess more recently it's being called a misconception or a myth about black

120
00:07:18.551 --> 00:07:22.870
holes. I know for the most part in the Saifai world, you know,

121
00:07:22.871 --> 00:07:26.680
it was always portrayed that you get sucked into a black hole. Basically,

122
00:07:26.681 --> 00:07:30.820
if you were, you know, in too close proximity to a black hole, that was it.

123
00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:34.960
You couldn't, you couldn't help but get sucked in. That's not exactly true,

124
00:07:34.961 --> 00:07:35.794
is it.

125
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.510
<v 3>Exactly right? Again, you should think of a black hole as,</v>

126
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.240
uh, in many of its properties.

127
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:48.160
It's very similar to any big blob of matter that you can have,

128
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.910
uh, if you're, if you're far away enough, uh, from it.

129
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:57.100
And so everything you can imagine doing in the vicinity of our son, for example,

130
00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.990
like having various objects in orbit around it, essentially,

131
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.800
uh, you know, for billions of years, you can do that with a black hole as well,

132
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.360
just because the black hole is there.

133
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.750
It doesn't mean that at some big vacuum cleaner that, um,

134
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:15.610
that sucks things in, uh, which is, you know, often portrayed that way.

135
00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:20.320
It makes it feel like some kind of, uh, some kind of, uh, intentional, uh,

136
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.450
behemoth. Um, no,

137
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:27.190
th they're just gravitating objects like anything else. And so you can,

138
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.780
you can, you can, uh, you can be near a black hole for an arbitrarily long time.

139
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:36.340
The issue then is what happens if you get to

140
00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:41.740
that point of closest approach whereby you then didn't

141
00:08:41.741 --> 00:08:46.150
have enough, uh, engine power to, uh, to escape,

142
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.240
or even if you had all the engine power in the world,

143
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.700
you couldn't get faster than the speed of light to get away.

144
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.220
And that's called crossing the event horizon,

145
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:59.610
and there is point of closest approach, which you then wouldn't be able to, uh,

146
00:08:59.611 --> 00:09:04.440
at least classically, uh, and I could explain what that means, um, uh, escape.

147
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.900
Uh, but if you're, if you're,

148
00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:10.890
if you're not within the event horizon in principle, you can, you can,

149
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.280
you can approach and, and move away and it doesn't suck you in.

150
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:19.940
<v 0>Well, I guess the big, what if for today is, uh, what if, uh, uh,</v>

151
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.650
our solar system orbited a black hole? Is it possible? I think,

152
00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.590
I think from what you're saying,

153
00:09:24.591 --> 00:09:28.640
it is possible for a planet or a solar system to orbit a black hole,

154
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:32.570
but is it also possible for them to orbit a black hole and sustain life?

155
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.430
<v 3>I would say my guess is probably yes. Uh,</v>

156
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:42.080
and I can imagine a number of different scenarios, uh, where that could,

157
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:46.730
where that could come about. So for example, uh,

158
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:47.361
well, let,

159
00:09:47.361 --> 00:09:52.190
let's first dispense with the issue of whether we think there may be other

160
00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:56.600
forms of life on other planets. Let's say that's not, um, not, you know,

161
00:09:56.601 --> 00:09:59.630
beyond the, uh, the, the realm of possibility.

162
00:09:59.631 --> 00:10:04.130
And you've probably discussed that in other shows. So let's say that there are,

163
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.440
uh, other stars for which there are other, uh,

164
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:12.830
other maybe earth Lake, or maybe not enough light, but they have a life. Now,

165
00:10:12.831 --> 00:10:16.430
it might be that that star, uh,

166
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.040
may have been part of a binary system. For example,

167
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.700
whether you have a double star, two stars orbiting each other,

168
00:10:22.701 --> 00:10:26.210
and then there are planets orbiting that system.

169
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.840
You can imagine that sort of thing. And maybe one of those, uh,

170
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:34.700
became a black hole. Um, it might've been that it, it,

171
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:35.000
uh,

172
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.470
it happened with some sort of cataclysmic explosion as often happens called a

173
00:10:39.471 --> 00:10:43.820
supernova explosion and type two supernova explosion that may well have

174
00:10:43.821 --> 00:10:46.430
obliterated all the life, uh, nearby.

175
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:51.530
But let's say let's let let's say it didn't um, then you could,

176
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:56.170
you could, that could actually be a rather unusual from our perspective, but a,

177
00:10:56.171 --> 00:10:58.190
a home for, uh,

178
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:02.780
for that form of life or another possibility

179
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:08.030
is that you have some star faring species that intentionally

180
00:11:08.031 --> 00:11:12.890
seeks out a black hole and decides to, um, settle around it,

181
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:17.500
that the build an object, which orbits it, or they, they,

182
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:22.250
they occupy some planetary matter that is

183
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:27.290
old between that, that black hole. And that becomes their star system.

184
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:32.750
It turns out you can actually mine black holes for energy in a certain kind of

185
00:11:32.751 --> 00:11:33.584
way.

186
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.760
And they would be among the most efficient sources of energy.

187
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.420
If you could do the kind of engineering you would need to, to exploit it.

188
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:46.550
So maybe there are super advanced civilizations that are living around black

189
00:11:46.551 --> 00:11:47.384
holes. Sorry.

190
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.870
<v 0>I going to say that literally sounds that Peter's wearing a t-shirt that says</v>

191
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:54.220
that's a story for another, what if mining.

192
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.840
<v 2>Block holes for energy is exactly a story for another,</v>

193
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:01.360
what if that is so cool and not something I think we've,

194
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.480
we've even heard about here, but we will explore it. Um,

195
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:09.160
lots of mysteries around black holes and a lot of MIS conceptions about black

196
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:13.810
holes. So thank you, professor Johnson for helping us clear some of those up,

197
00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:17.080
uh, we're gonna, we're gonna have a longer conversation with prevents, uh,

198
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.480
professor Johnson on the other side, before we do,

199
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.300
where's the best place for people to follow your work?

200
00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.470
<v 3>Oh, gosh. Um, well, uh,</v>

201
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.920
I would say they could probably, uh,

202
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:33.780
either find me through my blog all through Twitter or Facebook or

203
00:12:33.781 --> 00:12:38.000
Instagram. Um, it's probably best just to Google me. I,

204
00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.220
my handle on those things is usually something called ASIN, Tosha,

205
00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:42.960
but telling you to spell that, uh,

206
00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.230
it's easy if you just Google my name and physics and you'll find me,

207
00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.080
and a nice compact way is to,

208
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:53.820
is to look at a graphic nonfiction book I wrote and drew a couple of years ago

209
00:12:53.821 --> 00:12:57.120
called the dialogues where actually I talk about some of these issues.

210
00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.020
<v 2>Great stuff, professor Johnson, uh, not surprising.</v>

211
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:05.220
Obviously we always get to learn cool stuff here on what if discuss what we're

212
00:13:05.221 --> 00:13:07.680
here for. Um, if you would ask me prior,

213
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:12.690
do black hole suck things in like a vacuum cleaner as he so eloquently put it,

214
00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:14.490
I would have said, yes, this is what we've learned.

215
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:19.320
That's what we've seen in movies and TV 10 episodes of star Trek based on it.

216
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.500
But as it turns out that mass,

217
00:13:22.501 --> 00:13:26.040
that incredible mass actually just creates gravity. Some people will say tomato,

218
00:13:26.041 --> 00:13:29.700
tomato, but I think it's a good clarification. What did you learn?

219
00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:34.290
I learned that you can, I was really impressed that you could mine a black hole.

220
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.670
That's super, I mean,

221
00:13:35.671 --> 00:13:38.460
I haven't learned more but enough about that because I want to ask him that sort

222
00:13:38.461 --> 00:13:40.860
of stuff on the other side. So, uh,

223
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:44.910
we will continue our discussion with professor Johnson on the extended audio

224
00:13:44.911 --> 00:13:48.900

there's nothing for you to click, just stay with us.

227
00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.640
We'll be back with more professor Johnson, otherwise,
