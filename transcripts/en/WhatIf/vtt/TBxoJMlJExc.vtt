00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.820
<v 0>This is how much plaque grows on your teeth after not brushing them for a</v>

2
00:00:05.821 --> 00:00:08.190
single day. Now,

3
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:11.490
this is just one day of not brushing your teeth,

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.540
but what would happen if you decided to stop brushing

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.760
forever? How much bacteria lives inside your mouth?

6
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.850
How could this affect your overall health and how long

7
00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:29.520
could you last before your teeth fell out?

8
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.250
This is what if,

9
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.240
and here's what would happen if you stopped brushing your teeth.

10
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.130
Plaque is a sticky film made up of bacteria,

11
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.370
leftover food particles and saliva.

12
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.300
It helps other types of bacteria adhere to your teeth,

13
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.560
meaning it only helps you most get dirtier and dirtier.

14
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.020
So we know plaque can grow pretty quickly on your teeth in just one day.

15
00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:02.130
But what would happen if you stopped brushing your teeth

16
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.690
for the rest of your life? Before we get to that,

17
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.140
what lives inside your mouth? On an average day,

18
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.200
over 6 million bacteria from 700 different species

19
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:20.910
live inside your mouth. Now not all of those are bad for you.

20
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.970
In fact, a lot of them promote good health,

21
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.320
but some bacteria living in your mouth are harmful to you.

22
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.450
That's why you brush your teeth since it helps get rid of that harmful bacteria.

23
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.900
And now you've suddenly decided to stop.

24
00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:39.540
Brushing week has gone by,

25
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:43.080
and you're starting to notice some serious, bad breath.

26
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.640
People stay a little bit further away from you when you try to talk to them,

27
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.380
but bad breath would be the last thing on your mind.

28
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.500
After just a week of not brushing your teeth,

29
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.150
the plaque in your mouth would begin to harden and form tartar.

30
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.740
This is like a really hard plaque that discolors your teeth.

31
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.240
And at this point only a dentist would be able to get rid of it.

32
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.360
And on top of all that your enamel would begin to be damaged as

33
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.920
bacteria continue to multiply in your mouth. Okay?

34
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.220
That's one week of not brushing. Let's fast,

35
00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:25.980
forward to one month in this crazy experiment.

36
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.560
So here's some good news.

37
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.250
If you normally spend an average of four minutes a day,

38
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:36.840
brushing your teeth at this point, you've saved two hold hours. Hey,

39
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.800
that's enough to watch a movie. And then we have some bad news,

40
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.360
which is everything.

41
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.880
<v 1>After not brushing your teeth for a month.</v>

42
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.280
<v 0>You'd start to get cavities.</v>

43
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.410
These holes in your teeth would continue to get deeper and deeper.

44
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.040
And they eventually fill with pus.

45
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.810
As time goes by the cavities in your teeth would get worse and worse.

46
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.810
You'd also start to develop Gingervitis,

47
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.320
which would inflame the gums around your teeth. Now,

48
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.140
good luck trying to eat anything, because at this point,

49
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.990
your gums would be incredibly sensitive.

50
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.100
This would continue for about a year. And after that,

51
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.480
you not brushing your teeth would lead to periodontitis.

52
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.910
This is when the inner layer of your gums starts to pull away from your teeth

53
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:37.930
and form pockets, which would collect food and bacteria.

54
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.680
Now, with all this extra bacteria in your mouth,

55
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.700
your immune system would start to destroy your gums.

56
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.880
And after your gums start to go away,

57
00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:52.930
you lose your teeth as they decade and fell out of your mouth.

58
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.470
And now that you don't have any teeth,

59
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.160
you could start to have health issues outside your mouth.

60
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.710
A study in California found that people who didn't brush their teeth daily had a

61
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:10.660
20 to 65% greater chance of getting dementia

62
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.910
than those who brushed multiple times a day.

63
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.010
And for all the guys out there who decided to stop brushing their teeth

64
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.000
well, that could lead to erectile dysfunction.

65
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.610
In a 2012 study,

66
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.290
it was found that 53% of the patients with erectile dysfunction

67
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.200
also had severe periodontitis.

68
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.930
So not brushing your teeth forever would not only affect your mouth,

69
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.270
but other parts of your body as well.

70
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.100
My advice just push your teeth.

71
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.150
It only takes a couple of minutes a day and you'll be a healthier person for it.

72
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.510
Okay. So it's obvious that not brushing your teeth would be pretty awful.

73
00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.540
Another thing that would be terrible for you only drinking Coca-Cola,

74
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.750
but we'll leave that story for another, what else.
