00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.350
<v 0>With so many amazing things happening in the world today,</v>

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.260
what could possibly go wrong?

3
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.360
<v 1>A giant asteroid is built on a collision course with earth and life.</v>

4
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.730
As we know it is on the brink

5
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.980
after the smoke clears, how do we start over?

6
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.260
Where would we live and what might we do

7
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.500
differently? This is what if,

8
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.690
and here's what would happen if there were only 1000 people on earth,

9
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.300
pandemics, election scandals, civil unrest,

10
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.760
why maybe it's time for a duo over a clean slate,

11
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.070
a fresh beginning with only 1000 people left on the

12
00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:59.750
planet. 500 women and 500 men. Where would we begin?

13
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.950
First of all, we'd need to work together to flourish,

14
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.680
rebuild society and repopulate the planet.

15
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.120
We'd need to farm hunt and help each other succeed.

16
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.770
Sounds like a pretty good starting point. Right? Okay.

17
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.390
Where would we find the ideal place to build this global village?

18
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.850
Most likely a temperate region.

19
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.860
That's not subject to huge threats from wildlife or natural disasters.

20
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.720
Let's stay away from the ring of fire because earthquakes would not help our

21
00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:36.950
society to rebuild.

22
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.390
We don't want to live in an area where malaria is common either.

23
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.380
That's good living in the North like Canada,

24
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.000
especially Northern Canada would mean surviving, intense winters.

25
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.650
So no. How about Mediterranean Europe?

26
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.300
It's got a long growing season for food and there aren't as many natural

27
00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:02.540
wildlife threats as there are in Africa or Australia.

28
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.170
Now that we found the perfect location,

29
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.360
let's start by meeting our basic survival needs like water, food,

30
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.100
shelter, and sleep.

31
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.090
We have to take care of them first because if people are hungry,

32
00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:20.720
then socializing, learning, or working,

33
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.260
won't be their main priority. Slowing progress

34
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.653
at this stage,

35
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.010
the people who understand how to take care of the land would be extremely

36
00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:35.240
valuable. They could teach others how to grow and harvest food.

37
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.310
These community members would likely be the farmers and the other households

38
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.790
would get rations. And there could be hunters in the crew.

39
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.440
There should be lots of meat options because animal life would be flourishing

40
00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:52.790
around the world. Without 7.8 billion humans,

41
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.250
animals would be free to roam wherever they wanted.

42
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.280
This would also do wonders for our planet.

43
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.360
The atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions would eventually level out and plant

44
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:06.010
life would flourish. Again.

45
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.560
The earth would finally recover after the centuries of stress due to so many

46
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:13.690
humans. Okay?

47
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:18.460
Now that our food is taken care of what about love and belonging?

48
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.140
We are social beings and we need relationships.

49
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.140
This includes acceptance that a group,

50
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.530
family love and intimacy.

51
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.570
If we don't meet these needs, people could become unhappy and even bored.

52
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.980
How would we divide the work in our smaller pool of humans?

53
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.730
It could be easier to accept each other as equals,

54
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:45.220
as we're all in this global village together,

55
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.960
we could develop this society with greater equality and balance between the

56
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:54.910
genders or we could revert to more traditional rules for men and women

57
00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.190
with women of childbearing years forced to have multiple pregnancy similar to

58
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:02.020
the Handmaid's tale. Well,

59
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.260
everything seemed to be going okay until that point still with

60
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.000
not too many people to choose from things like love and attraction,

61
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.240
wouldn't necessarily dictate who you get intimate with.

62
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.660
And those creepy arrangements could be a thing,

63
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.710
but if you're a fertile man or woman,

64
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.120
you might be treated better because you're responsible for increasing the

65
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:32.140
population. As we start to repopulate the planet,

66
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.200
there would be a need for doctors and medical professionals,

67
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.740
builders and construction workers would also be helpful.

68
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.930
Teachers would be necessary,

69
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.850
but people would likely start doing internships to learn in such a dramatically

70
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:49.300
different society. If someone wanted to be a doctor,

71
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.130
they could shadow the doctors for several years and learn from experience rather

72
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:58.960
than in a school jobs in this new society may no longer

73
00:04:58.961 --> 00:05:00.550
have any cash value.

74
00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:04.150
And we could see ourselves going into an exchange economy.

75
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.470
Something like I'll help you build your home. If you teach my kids to read,

76
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.170
going back to a cash based society may take some time and with

77
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.120
no global infrastructure to rely upon for a supply chain, barter and trade,

78
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.880
make sense. At least in the short term,

79
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.520
a 1000 person community wouldn't guarantee a stable population

80
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.100
we'd need to work together to overcome the challenges of living without a modern

81
00:05:33.101 --> 00:05:33.934
society.

82
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.460
The biggest problem would be another disaster happening and wiping

83
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:42.220
out many of this already small population,

84
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.960
even a sickness could kill many people and leave the community vulnerable.

85
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.720
And what would happen if all humans suddenly disappeared from earth?

86
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:58.300
Well, that's a story for another. What if.
