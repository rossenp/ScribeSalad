00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:02.903
<v 0>Oh, my God.</v>

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:08.450
[inaudible].

3
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.400
<v 1>Twinkle twinkle little star. How I wonder what you, but wait a minute.</v>

4
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.870
Why are you twinkling so much? Whoa guys,

5
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.460
that's no diamond in the sky that looks like a supernova.

6
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.810
As much as we love to blow stuff up here on earth,

7
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.480
no bombs or pyrotechnics could compare to the incredible force

8
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.030
of nature's biggest explosion.

9
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.310
The supernova as a star reaches its grand

10
00:00:40.311 --> 00:00:45.200
finale and explodes. What would happen to life on earth?

11
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.850
If we were close by how far away from a

12
00:00:49.851 --> 00:00:52.520
supernova are we considered safe?

13
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.310
Could anything survive?

14
00:00:55.311 --> 00:01:00.110
It's deadly radiation and what makes super

15
00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:02.210
Novi valuable to us?

16
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.650
This is what if, and here's what would happen.

17
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.220
If a supernova exploded close to earth

18
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.570
before you freak out earth is in a relatively safe patch of space

19
00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:18.890
called the local bubble.

20
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.930
This peanut shaped region of expanding gas in our Milky way.

21
00:01:23.931 --> 00:01:28.880
Galaxy results from nearby supernova explosions that occurred

22
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.290
20 million years ago.

23
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.540
These explosions helped shape our solar system, spreading gas,

24
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.800
Dustin heavier elements like uranium and gold to earth

25
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.290
without the super Novi.

26
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.240
We wouldn't have any shiny gold bling or powerful nuclear reactors.

27
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.010
So you can literally count your lucky stars. Okay,

28
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:56.120
but are we in danger of any nearby supernova?

29
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.980
On average,

30
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.570
a supernova will occur about once every 50 years in the Milky way.

31
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.540
Thankfully, there are no stars,

32
00:02:05.541 --> 00:02:09.830
massive enough to become a supernova within 50 light years of the earth.

33
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.120
There is however one binary star system within

34
00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:18.860
159 light years of earth that could potentially put us at

35
00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:23.210
risk binary star systems are type one

36
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.073
supernova.

37
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.750
This happens in a tumultuous dance between two stars where matter

38
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.610
is sucked from one star into another, typically a white dwarf.

39
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.310
Eventually the white dwarf explodes resulting in an Epic

40
00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:41.144
supernova.

41
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.510
On the other hand type two supernova occur when a star runs out of

42
00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:52.460
fuel and some of its mass flows into its core over time,

43
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.620
the core will start to grow and get so heavy that it can't withstand its

44
00:02:57.621 --> 00:03:00.430
gravitational force and blue.

45
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.420
The core collapses and a supernova is born.

46
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.780
When these explosions occur,

47
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.130
a powerful blast of radiation is spread throughout space.

48
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:16.960
That will kill anything within 50 light years to

49
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.910
put this in perspective how our solar system is only about

50
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.380
two light years wide.

51
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:27.280
So the supernovas blast would be the distance of

52
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.490
25 of our solar systems in a row.

53
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.040
If a supernova occurred as close as 30 light years away,

54
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.520
we'd have bigger problems than a pandemic on our hands.

55
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.100
The intense blast of radiation would carry a massive influx of

56
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.600
high energy neutrinos that would boil any living creature from the

57
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.840
inside out. Hope you like your meals poached.

58
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.630
The entire earth could be vaporized in just a fraction of a second.

59
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:00.190
If the supernova was close enough,

60
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.470
the shockwave would arrive with enough force to wipe out our entire

61
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.960
atmosphere. And even our oceans,

62
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.960
the exploded star would grow brighter for about three weeks after the explosion

63
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.870
casting shadows, even during the day,

64
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.480
even if life survived,

65
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.400
the superheated gas from the supernova would emit deadly amounts of

66
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:26.230
UV and gamma radiation.

67
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.360
These rays would destroy the ozone layer leading to the formation of

68
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:35.740
nitrous oxide, smog. We would all have to go deep,

69
00:04:35.741 --> 00:04:38.290
underground and embrace our new lives.

70
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:42.910
As mole people do escape the lethal radiation, poisonous atmosphere.

71
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.670
Unfortunately there would be an increase in mutations and deadly

72
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:49.510
cancers.

73
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.710
And to top it all off our phytoplankton,

74
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.660
which account for almost 50% of all photosynthetic activity on

75
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:00.490
earth would die off.

76
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.620
Phytoplankton is vital to us and can absorb carbon dioxide from our

77
00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:09.790
atmosphere without it we'd have a tougher time breathing

78
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.440
global warming would accelerate even further beyond our control

79
00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.150
and as an essential food source at the bottom of the Marine food chain,

80
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.980
a lack of phytoplankton would result in secret years becoming extinct

81
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.640
and eventually humankind would too.

82
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.800
So like many what ifs, almost everything dies,

83
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.860
but there might still be a few lucky speeds seize up extreme of files

84
00:05:40.861 --> 00:05:42.840
that can survive the intense radiation.

85
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.040
After a few hundred or thousands of years,

86
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.060
the supernova would leave an impressive Nebula in its wake.

87
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.700
At the very least we'd have a fantastic view in our night sky. Well,

88
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.760
for those of us that can see maybe these extreme of

89
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:06.680
files would evolve to have eyes someday and become the size of humans.

90
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.740
Well, whatever might happen, that's a story for another.

91
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.970
What if.
