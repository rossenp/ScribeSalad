00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.590
<v 0>Hi, Lily. Don't kill me, please.</v>

2
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.750
Among us is a video game that has taken the world by storm.

3
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.520
It's one of the most watched games on Twitch and YouTube,

4
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.070
even politicians are playing it,

5
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.953
sorry,

6
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.090
but what if instead of this game happening on our computer

7
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:33.480
screens, it happened in real life,

8
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.620
which crewmates would be sus,

9
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.640
what sort of tasks do you need to do?

10
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
And could you survive until the end?

11
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.200
This is what if,

12
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.150
and here's what would happen if among us happened in real life

13
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.830
for the uninitiated. Here's how among us works.

14
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.200
The game can have up to 10 players. The majority of them are known as crewmates.

15
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.010
They spend their time trying to fix their failing spaceship.

16
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.240
The rest are imposters or aliens.

17
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.820
Their goal is to stop the crew mates from repairing the ship by any means

18
00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:24.350
necessary. That includes deception murder,

19
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.690
or just being really annoying.

20
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.520
The trick here is that the majority of the game is played without being able

21
00:01:34.521 --> 00:01:36.230
to communicate with the other players.

22
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.940
The only time you're able to talk is when a meeting is called

23
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.380
there,

24
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.340
you can discuss who you think the imposter might be and shove them out of the

25
00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:47.174
airlock.

26
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.370
If the imposter is a really good liar, you're going to have a tough time.

27
00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.010
But if the crew mates managed to eject the imposters before it's too

28
00:02:01.011 --> 00:02:03.080
late, then they win the game

29
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.960
and don't forget anyone who's killed can always come back as a ghost.

30
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.130
Now that we know more about how among us works,

31
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.150
what would happen if it took place in real life?

32
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.960
Well, for this scenario, naturally,

33
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.280
we're going to have it take place on a space ship and what better space ship

34
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.440
than the international space station.

35
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.060
You and nine other crew mates are on board.

36
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.010
You have to complete tasks on the ship or everything goes wrong.

37
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.680
The only problem here is that three of your other crewmates are

38
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.750
frequently aliens.

39
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.090
They are going to do everything they can to prevent you from getting your job

40
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.830
done. Issues on the ISS are pretty common.

41
00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:57.950
And crew members often have to work together to repair them.

42
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.140
On September 28th, 2023.

43
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.520
<v 1>ISS members were woken by mission control. After it was reported,</v>

44
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.170
there was a leak on the ship.

45
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.630
The three crew members all had to work together to identify the leak and then

46
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:17.230
repair it. This was an ongoing problem.

47
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.540
First discovered more than a year earlier,

48
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.610
the crew had spent several weeks figuring out where the leak was coming from.

49
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.120
So unlike among us your tasks here,

50
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:32.680
wouldn't be simple mini games where you're connecting wires or destroying

51
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:33.514
asteroids.

52
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.370
This would require teamwork and some intricate mechanical engineering.

53
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.250
And just like the game,

54
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.920
let's assume you're wearing a space suit and you're unable to communicate with

55
00:03:46.921 --> 00:03:51.720
your crew. Now you're performing an incredibly complicated task.

56
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.460
One that requires multiple people, and you're unable to talk to anyone.

57
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.540
What could possibly go wrong? Well,

58
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.560
now that your crew is distracted by all these complex tasks,

59
00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.840
this would be the perfect opportunity for the imposters to cause some trouble

60
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.500
that you wouldn't know exactly what they're doing, but that

61
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.770
a dead body has been reported.

62
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:22.050
And of course it was in electrical. It's always electrical.

63
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.060
Now you can take off your space suit and talk to your crew,

64
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.760
who is the imposter?

65
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.380
You saw that one guy who went toward electrical,

66
00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:37.950
but then you could have sworn he was helping you with the task.

67
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.640
You were near the one dressed in blue for a bit,

68
00:04:41.641 --> 00:04:44.670
but he didn't seem to do anything strange.

69
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.360
Could it be? But wait, as you've been thinking during this time,

70
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.380
the entire crew has decided that you must be the impostor.

71
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.890
I guess that's what you get for being so quiet.

72
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.560
They've all cast their votes. And now you've been objected into space

73
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.420
instead of getting a harmless game overseen,

74
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.690
this would mean imminent death for you.

75
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.960
As soon as you're kicked out of the ship,

76
00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.580
your lungs would expand and burst due to the loss of external pressure.

77
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.900
Your skin would balloon up from the water in your body.

78
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.750
You'd also get a nasty sunburn from the radiation and then suffocate to death.

79
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.070
If you had just told the cremates what you were doing,

80
00:05:35.071 --> 00:05:38.850
you would have had a better chance. Well,

81
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.480
now that you're a ghost and can get a better sense of what's going on.

82
00:05:42.481 --> 00:05:46.230
You see that you were right. It was the blue guy,

83
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.510
and now he's wiping out the West of your crew. Oh no.

84
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.590
And after all of your crew is gone,

85
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.360
the ISS would then be completely destroyed.

86
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.040
Let's hope that if aliens are among us,

87
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.320
that they're pretty obvious and we don't have to worry about anyone being sus or

88
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:14.270
not to learn more about among us, check out this week's.

89
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:18.110
What if discussed podcast? We learn the ins and outs of the game,

90
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.190
tips and tricks with Leanna Rupert of game informer. Check it out.
