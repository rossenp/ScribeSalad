WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.381
<v 0>Theory,</v>

2
00:00:01.381 --> 00:00:05.880
if there were as much matter as there were anti-matter it all just would have

3
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:10.770
been isolated and we would have had a universe of energy. But again,

4
00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:15.420
it was that one part in a trillion a little bit more

5
00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:19.440
matter, uh, that, that may have explained why we are here today.

6
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.360
<v 1>So, Peter, yes,</v>

7
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.770
not uncommon these days to hear people describe, uh,

8
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.070
the current state of things as upside down.

9
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.620
<v 2>I think that's fair to say in the last six months,</v>

10
00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:48.770
a lot of people's lives have been upside down a lot longer than that, but, uh,

11
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.380
everybody's been sort of upside down the last six months.

12
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.310
<v 1>No doubt about it, but possibly because of that, um,</v>

13
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.790
some news that came out, I believe it was April and, you know,

14
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.210
it was smack dab in the middle of where COVID was really blowing up,

15
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.230
so to speak.

16
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.830
And of course there was a lot of attention on that and you could argue

17
00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:10.250
potentially why this didn't get as much attention as it did.

18
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.450
Yes. And absolutely. And, and to be honest, even within that,

19
00:01:14.451 --> 00:01:19.130
taking that all into account, it may be, did get a relatively,

20
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.090
a lot of coverage,

21
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.530
but there was a story in April that there was an experiment going on through

22
00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:28.370
NASA, up in the Arctic. Um, we'll get into that little later,

23
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.200
but essentially what the results had shown was

24
00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:38.180
potentially evidence that a parallel universe

25
00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:39.890
existed where time went backwards.

26
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.230
And of course that was the juicy headline universe,

27
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.710
parallel universe discovered with where time goes backwards. People are like,

28
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.270
what? But I don't. Yeah. I mean, I think, you know, some people were like, wow,

29
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.400
whatever, but other people were like, wait a sec,

30
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.720
what the hell are you talking about here?

31
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.910
<v 2>It was matter's evil.</v>

32
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.950
<v 1>Twin. It was matter's evil twin,</v>

33
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.130
our friend or enemy anti-matter.

34
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.070
<v 2>Yeah. I remember during the backwards a universe theory. Yeah.</v>

35
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.630
<v 1>Which again, I mean, interestingly,</v>

36
00:02:05.631 --> 00:02:10.240
the movie tenant is out now where that idea of time going backwards is actually

37
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.390
just not a spoiler people relax. It is it's in the trailer. Um,

38
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.740
but this idea that there could be literally, uh, an opposite universe,

39
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.210
bizarro world, if you will, like in Seinfeld, like in Seinfeld,

40
00:02:23.211 --> 00:02:27.170
like in Superman and it's not something I realized

41
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.350
anti-matter is not something we know very much about.

42
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.350
<v 2>Do you know who does know a lot about anti-matter.</v>

43
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.890
<v 1>Our guest today? Of course, Liz Lando, Lando.</v>

44
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.840
<v 2>Liz Landau is an award-winning journalist and science communicator.</v>

45
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.730
A self-professed lifelong nerd. Liz is interested in astronomy,

46
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.660
particle physics, archeology allergies, math music.

47
00:02:50.661 --> 00:02:55.490
And of course the number PI by Liz holds

48
00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.310
a bachelor's degree in anthropology from Princeton university and a master's in

49
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:02.440
journalism from Columbia university.

50
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.990
Liz spent six years at CNN before joining NASA in 2014.

51
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.050
Liz, welcome to what if discussed?

52
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.640
<v 0>Oh, it's so great to be here. Thanks so much for having me.</v>

53
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.980
<v 1>So in the beginning, as Peter and I were talking about off the top,</v>

54
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.430
uh, according to big bang theory,

55
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.230
a lot of energy was created a lot. A lot of matter was created.

56
00:03:28.231 --> 00:03:33.210
A lot of anti-matter was created. And then somehow the matter one out,

57
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.380
we get galaxies and planets and stars and Peter and Richard and Liz,

58
00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:38.880
and kind of,

59
00:03:38.881 --> 00:03:42.360
there's still a pretty big mystery as to what happened to the anti-matter.

60
00:03:42.361 --> 00:03:45.750
And I'm sure I'm butchering this, but that's why you're here. Um,

61
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.750
Kara new positive guests as to what happened,

62
00:03:48.751 --> 00:03:53.070
it could be worth a Nobel prize that maybe you could share with Peter and I.

63
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.480
<v 0>Right? Yeah. So as you said,</v>

64
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.120
it's kind of like that bare naked lady song that plays at the beginning of the

65
00:04:00.121 --> 00:04:01.650
show, the big bang theory,

66
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.220
our whole universe was in a hot debt state.

67
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.510
Then nearly 14 billion years ago, expansion started weight.

68
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.250
Like that's actually accurate. But in any case,

69
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.770
in those first moments know there was this creation of

70
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.510
equal amounts of matter. And anti-matter, and it is, as you said,

71
00:04:24.511 --> 00:04:29.460
it's such a mystery about why we are all made of matter

72
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.170
today. And in fact,

73
00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:35.670
it would have only taken one in a trillion

74
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:37.630
of an imbalance,

75
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.630
one part in a trillion more matter than anti-matter,

76
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.340
uh, to give rise to the universe that day.

77
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.540
And what was responsible for that one part in Australia is

78
00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:53.400
still a mystery.

79
00:04:53.401 --> 00:04:56.940
I don't have any particular death of my own,

80
00:04:56.941 --> 00:05:01.890
but the particle physics says that places like CERN and Europe are

81
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.780
really looking at what kind of physical processes could do

82
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.790
rise to an imbalance of matter. And ants matters such as when certain particles.

83
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.820
<v 2>Math, science, history unraveling the mystery. Yes, ladies and gentlemen,</v>

84
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.760
it all starts with the big bang. Liz.

85
00:05:20.761 --> 00:05:24.000
You can obviously create a lot of energy by splitting an atom,

86
00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:25.710
as we found out by, uh,

87
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.160
creating nuclear power and ultimately nuclear weapons.

88
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.480
How does that stack up with the energy created when matter and anti-matter

89
00:05:33.481 --> 00:05:34.314
collide?

90
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.551
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

91
00:05:35.551 --> 00:05:40.350
So you might be surprised to know that while we don't see any

92
00:05:40.351 --> 00:05:45.150
anti-matter around us, there actually is a tiny, tiny bit.

93
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.260
And in fact, I brought an anti-matter producer with me.

94
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.250
This is a banana banana,

95
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.190
and any banana really is actually producing a thimble particle of

96
00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:02.570
anti-matter every 75 minutes or so.

97
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.390
<v 1>That's about how long a banana lasts in my house before it turns black.</v>

98
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.400
<v 0>And so, uh, that might, so if you got to get it all the bananas of the world,</v>

99
00:06:12.401 --> 00:06:12.821
however,

100
00:06:12.821 --> 00:06:17.800
you still wouldn't have enough anti-matter to produce other

101
00:06:17.801 --> 00:06:21.490
kinds of explosion, but you might see in a scifi show.

102
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.820
<v 1>Is that, is that because of the potassium in the banana.</v>

103
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.200
<v 0>That's correct. A potassium 40 is a radioactive isotope,</v>

104
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.670
and that's why every 75 minutes or so it's a single,

105
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.810
an anti electron positron is actually coming out,

106
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.000
but a single particle,

107
00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.620
especially a single particle anti-matter will not stay around for a while

108
00:06:44.621 --> 00:06:48.010
because it will immediately meet its evil twin,

109
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:53.200
a regular electronic, they will not wait. Uh, in fact,

110
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.630
single particles annihilating is really not going to produce any

111
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.010
noticeable effect.

112
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.330
Otherwise we would see flashing lights all the time, right?

113
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.290
I bet our own bodies because you said negligible, but, uh,

114
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.990
AIDS in a mouse of its cutter.

115
00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:16.000
But at any case you really need a gram of

116
00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:16.834
it.

117
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.520
If you had a gram of matter and a gram of anti-matter

118
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.770
that could actually produce the explosion of a nuclear bomb,

119
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:27.971
however,

120
00:07:27.971 --> 00:07:32.680
we can all take comfort in the fact that it's nearly impossible to

121
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.910
collect a gram of anti-matter because, uh,

122
00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.080
these particles are so fleeting, they're annihilating with matter all the time,

123
00:07:41.081 --> 00:07:43.120
and it's very difficult to extract them.

124
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:48.850
<v 1>And in fact, very cost, uh, negligible at sailor, I guess,</v>

125
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.020
constantly costly I could have just said opposite. Uh,

126
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.380
cause I mean there's all sorts of numbers floating around as to what it would

127
00:07:56.381 --> 00:07:58.540
cost to create. Anti-matter uh,

128
00:07:58.541 --> 00:08:03.070
I have one milligram of anti-matter would be about a hundred

129
00:08:03.071 --> 00:08:07.750
billion dollars to produce why is creating

130
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.720
anti-matter so expensive.

131
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.150
<v 0>Yeah. Again,</v>

132
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:17.980
when you have only single particles of anti-matter being

133
00:08:17.981 --> 00:08:22.690
created naturally and being annihilated in less than a second, you know,

134
00:08:22.691 --> 00:08:25.000
it's very difficult to, uh,

135
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:29.050
mask them in any appreciable quantity. Um,

136
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.170
it's some of the experiments that they're doing, um, for example,

137
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:37.050
the alpha experiment at CERN in Switzerland, uh,

138
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.980
they actually have to decelerate these particles and they have to have some

139
00:08:41.981 --> 00:08:46.330
kind of magnetic fields to track them. So you have to have like a,

140
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:51.160
literally a magnetic trap to get all the anti-matter together to even

141
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:56.250
really study their properties in any appreciable. And again,

142
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.280
even that experiment is,

143
00:08:58.281 --> 00:09:02.490
is part of this huge nuclear research organization,

144
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:07.080
stern. And, you know, Sarah also has the large Hadron Collider, uh,

145
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:11.940
know multi-billion dollar world's largest science experiment, uh,

146
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:15.930
which also, uh, you know, studies anti-matter. So, uh, yeah,

147
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.020
just because of the tiny,

148
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:22.890
tiny amount of anti-matter available, uh,

149
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:27.210
it's so expensive to do anything meaningful with it

150
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.103
scientifically.

151
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.750
<v 2>Hmm. One of the reasons people have looked into creating anti-matter is to</v>

152
00:09:32.751 --> 00:09:34.460
potentially power spaceships.

153
00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:39.260
Why would anti-matter be effective as an energy source for space exploration?

154
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:45.200
<v 0>Yeah. If you could get appreciable amounts of it together, uh, you know, again,</v>

155
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:50.840
to have that huge explosion of annihilation of

156
00:09:50.841 --> 00:09:55.310
matter and anti-matter together, uh, that could be extremely powerful

157
00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:01.460
as a kilogram of anti-matter and a kilogram of matter if they were

158
00:10:01.461 --> 00:10:06.080
somehow able to come together of that could be like a thousand

159
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:10.700
atomic bomb. That was, that would be a lot of energy.

160
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.900
Absolutely. Um, but again, because it's so expensive,

161
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:20.180
it is sort of impossible to do anything like that to harvest the

162
00:10:20.181 --> 00:10:21.920
power of it's matter right now.

163
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.400
<v 2>Yeah. It would probably be pretty dangerous to have in a spaceship too.</v>

164
00:10:25.401 --> 00:10:26.750
I'm imagining all that power.

165
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.740
Are there any other practical applications of anti matter that we know of?

166
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:36.620
<v 0>Yeah, actually it's fairly awesome. In the medical fields we have,</v>

167
00:10:36.621 --> 00:10:39.290
what's called a pet scan that you might've heard of a,

168
00:10:39.291 --> 00:10:43.100
which stands for positron emission tomography.

169
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.750
And this is actually using antsy matter to do

170
00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.810
a brain scan noninvasively. Uh,

171
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.670
what they do is they give you a substance that has a radioactive

172
00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:00.620
isotope in it. Uh, it's just like bananas have radioactive potassium 40 up,

173
00:11:00.621 --> 00:11:04.760
you would get a harmless substance that has a radioactive element in it.

174
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.210
And then as that radio isotope decays,

175
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:13.100
it emits these anti-matter particles that then interact with

176
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.770
your brain again in a fairly harmless way.

177
00:11:15.771 --> 00:11:20.660
Cause there are so few particles in a substantial way such

178
00:11:20.661 --> 00:11:23.450
that you can actually produce a brain scan.

179
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:28.060
<v 1>Sort of like a, an MRI on steroids. Yeah.</v>

180
00:11:28.061 --> 00:11:32.180
I guess that that's the type of eloquent, uh, articulate examples.

181
00:11:32.181 --> 00:11:36.800
You get here on what is discussed from Richard and Peter. Um,

182
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.590
so when I hear, you know,

183
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.500
anti-matter explained and it's essentially the mirror opposite of matter,

184
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:49.250
you know, it rotates at a negative versus a positive. And if you,

185
00:11:49.251 --> 00:11:53.650
if you do a deeper dive, it's essentially, you know, uh,

186
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.790
two matters down black to matters white, that type of thing, which, you know,

187
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:02.020
kind of sounds like bizarro world Superman or a lot of the other scifi,

188
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.200
Ebony and ivory. Um,

189
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:08.920
and so that could get someone to wondering,

190
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:11.920
and that someone of course is me. Um,

191
00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:17.110
it sounds almost like parallel universe theory and

192
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.960
that might've been sort of crazy talk at some point, if we were doing,

193
00:12:19.961 --> 00:12:22.750
what if discussed 10, 20, 30, 40 years ago,

194
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.660
these days was string theory and mult, uh,

195
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.490
and multiple universe theory being more accepted in mainstream physics.

196
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.870
Is this now something that could be the,

197
00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:39.590
sort of the first real ability to, we talked off the top about that?

198
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.580
The news that came out earlier in April about the, you know,

199
00:12:42.581 --> 00:12:44.920
maybe there was evidence or that, you know,

200
00:12:44.921 --> 00:12:47.620
there was a universe that time was going backwards, et cetera,

201
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:52.480
is anti-matter may be the sort of the window into really understanding that.

202
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:54.630
Well.

203
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.510
<v 0>The short answer is we don't know. I mean,</v>

204
00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:02.100
there's really no evidence that's substantial of a parallel universe or

205
00:13:02.101 --> 00:13:04.740
anything, but it is really intriguing,

206
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.970
but every particle we know has an evil twin,

207
00:13:08.971 --> 00:13:13.620
if you were to say something like that. And, uh, you know, if you, uh,

208
00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:18.060
Richard Fineman had a quote about, you know, if you were to meet your, uh,

209
00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.930
anti-matter twin on bars, like don't shake hands.

210
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.690
Uh, but yeah, I mean, right now, you know, anti-matter is,

211
00:13:26.691 --> 00:13:31.170
is really most interesting to scientists because it really gives us this,

212
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.930
uh, it's such a fundamental mystery about why we are the way that we are and

213
00:13:36.931 --> 00:13:40.920
really why we exist at all. Because again, in theory,

214
00:13:40.921 --> 00:13:44.610
if there were as much matter as there were anti-matter,

215
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.440
it all just would have annihilated and we'd,

216
00:13:46.441 --> 00:13:50.610
we would have had a universe of energy. Uh, but again,

217
00:13:50.611 --> 00:13:55.570
it was that one part in a trillion that was a

218
00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:58.060
little bit more matter, uh, that,

219
00:13:58.061 --> 00:14:01.320
that may have explained why we are here today. Hmm.

220
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.510
<v 1>Doesn't sound random to me, but that of course is a story for another,</v>

221
00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.150
um, can you stick around Liz? Cause we have plenty more to talk about. Um, we,

222
00:14:12.151 --> 00:14:13.620
we we'll get to that on the other side,

223
00:14:13.621 --> 00:14:18.090
on the extended version of what if discussed the audio, uh, podcast?

224
00:14:18.091 --> 00:14:22.110
Where can people find your work? Oh yeah.

225
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:23.550
<v 0>You go to my website,</v>

226
00:14:23.551 --> 00:14:28.200
Liz land out.com or you can follow me on Twitter. Uh,

227
00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:29.430
I am,

228
00:14:29.431 --> 00:14:34.260
co-hosting a podcast called pod paper scissors that you can find on Cod

229
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.950
paper, scissors.com. Uh, for NASA,

230
00:14:37.951 --> 00:14:41.490
I produce a podcast called gravity assist, which is at

231
00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:44.900
nasa.gov/gravity center. Um,

232
00:14:44.901 --> 00:14:49.620
and I also write songs about science that you can find on my YouTube

233
00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:52.610
channel, which is youtube.com/.

234
00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:56.800
<v 1>We're just riffing off the top there. That was that's.</v>

235
00:14:56.830 --> 00:15:01.360
That's actually one of your many talents is singing improv and

236
00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:06.070
also talking about the solar system, ladies and gentlemen,

237
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.220
that is Liz Landau stick around for more with Liz on the other side.

238
00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:11.380
Where can people find that link, Peter?

239
00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.050
<v 2>Well, if you're watching the YouTube,</v>

240
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.430
you can find it right below the window here. This is it,

241
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.450
this right down here. But if you're listening already on the podcast,

242
00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.090
don't go looking for a link. You can't you're wearing headphones.

243
00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:27.300
You're not looking at a screen. There's no link to look for.

244
00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:31.180
Just keep listening. We'll continue with Liz Lando on the other side. Okay.

245
00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.070
<v 1>Thanks Liz. We'll talk to you later in the show.</v>

246
00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:36.100
<v 0>Fine. Thank you so much. Um.</v>

247
00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.790
<v 1>Lots to talk about after that sort of first half discussion,</v>

248
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:44.290
clearly anti the people out there right now, making Bitcoins and like.

249
00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.100
<v 2>Yeah. In your basement, like 15 computers and whatever. Oh my God.</v>

250
00:15:48.101 --> 00:15:51.070
Imagine how much they could make. If they had powered their computers with.

251
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:55.750
<v 1>Two words for you, auntie matter, get on it. It's basically the new gold.</v>

252
00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.440
<v 2>Oh, you mean you're talking about them finding anti-matter.</v>

253
00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.890
I thought you were talking about powering their Bitcoin computers with

254
00:16:02.891 --> 00:16:06.100
anti-matter because those Bitcoin computers use quite a lot of electricity.

255
00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:07.330
<v 1>So here's the business plan.</v>

256
00:16:07.331 --> 00:16:11.950
You create the anti-matter then you put that anti-matter into powering those

257
00:16:11.951 --> 00:16:14.500
computers. You can make more anti-matter and of course you're rich.

258
00:16:14.501 --> 00:16:18.250
You're a superbill and you have a bond building, but that's another discussion.

259
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:19.930
No, but in all seriousness, I mean,

260
00:16:19.931 --> 00:16:23.740
it is interesting that you have the top scientist on the planet earth,

261
00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:28.750
who all seem to have a consensus around the idea that at that big bang

262
00:16:28.751 --> 00:16:33.100
origin point, an equal amount of matter anti-matter is created.

263
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.940
We're all, we're all in agreement on. Yeah, no. Yeah. We're all. Okay.

264
00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:42.520
The anti-matter essentially for the most part outside of bananas and some other

265
00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.320
folk around disappear.

266
00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.850
<v 0>Yeah. Anybody have any idea where the auntie? Nope. Anybody? Okay.</v>

267
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.980
<v 1>I have any idea what it means. No, like you don't,</v>

268
00:16:50.981 --> 00:16:54.130
you usually it'll have some rogue people, some scientists out there with some,

269
00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:58.450
you know, some strong theories, but basically matter wins out.

270
00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.470
You have the creation of things that we see as solid and anti matter is still a

271
00:17:02.471 --> 00:17:05.410
big question, Mark. And the place again, not surprisingly,

272
00:17:05.411 --> 00:17:09.130
perhaps because it was in the news. So prominently years ago,

273
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.350
when they were looking for the God particle CERN.

274
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:15.100
<v 2>They know the place. Well, they can create it. Yes.</v>

275
00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.350
<v 1>But as she's talking about, I mean,</v>

276
00:17:17.351 --> 00:17:19.930
I don't know what the price tag was of CERN to build CERN,

277
00:17:19.931 --> 00:17:24.910
but it's in the billions it's, you know, stories in the, in the underground.

278
00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:29.680
And when, when people were talking about that whole, you know, again,

279
00:17:29.681 --> 00:17:33.790
the search for the God particle the Higgs boson. If people don't know the term,

280
00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:39.070
but you know, some people were asking questions, layman like myself and myself,

281
00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:41.650
wait a sec, let me get this straight here.

282
00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.880
You're going to be crashing particles of anti-matter and matter into each other

283
00:17:45.881 --> 00:17:50.280
at close to the speed of light. Now I just here on Wikipedia.

284
00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:54.540
It seems to say, when that happens, they self annihilate and everything.

285
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.300
And it creates some sort of energy level. As Liz talked about,

286
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:01.110
that's on the scale with atomic bombs. Should I be concerned?

287
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.100
<v 2>A lot of people thought perhaps we were going to create a black hole. Yeah.</v>

288
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:07.790
<v 1>Yes. But we didn't know definitive. Well, you and I.</v>

289
00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.330
<v 2>Sweden the layman as you speak, but the scientists knew,</v>

290
00:18:11.331 --> 00:18:15.740
these knew one particle versus one particle will create an explosion. This big,

291
00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:16.610
you know,

292
00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:20.090
a gram of anti-matter versus a gram of anti-matter will create an explosion.

293
00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:24.620
<v 1>Big manageable. And it seems again, when you're on the other side of history,</v>

294
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.400
things seem impossible, right? Again, you know, we've talked about it before.

295
00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.990
I think it was like late 18 hundreds at the end of the 19th century,

296
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:38.240
it was considered scientifically impossible for lighter than air

297
00:18:38.241 --> 00:18:40.250
flight, as it was called flying,

298
00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.700
I think 1908,

299
00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:48.140
the Wright brothers are flying a plane like less than whatever, 10 years later,

300
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:52.010
they took something that was completely inconceivable and literally considered

301
00:18:52.011 --> 00:18:53.540
impossible. And then they did it.

302
00:18:53.541 --> 00:18:58.160
We know how that story ended now cut to we're going to the moon. So I.

303
00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.890
<v 2>Mean, you could argue that story has not ended. And absolutely.</v>

304
00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:01.250
<v 1>And I agree.</v>

305
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:06.200
Well maybe that's where w where I'm going unconsciously is that you figure out

306
00:19:06.201 --> 00:19:10.070
this anti-matter issue and the energy that's created through that,

307
00:19:10.071 --> 00:19:12.740
and you could harness this. Now we made the wrong,

308
00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.980
let's say we made a mistake. You could argue,

309
00:19:15.981 --> 00:19:20.180
some people would say nuclear energy is a massive part of really cleaning up the

310
00:19:20.181 --> 00:19:24.230
world and getting it safer, but also, you know, getting rid of fossil fuels,

311
00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.220
other people would say, no,

312
00:19:25.221 --> 00:19:29.240
I think splitting the atom was a mistake because of the ramifications of nuclear

313
00:19:29.241 --> 00:19:31.910
weapons. Do you trust us Peter speech?

314
00:19:31.911 --> 00:19:36.770
And to be able to crack the nut on anti-matter for the pluses,

315
00:19:36.771 --> 00:19:39.140
it could create for the world versus the minuses.

316
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.110
<v 2>I do. I do, because humanity,</v>

317
00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.960
if you're talking about the mistakes made with nuclear,

318
00:19:44.961 --> 00:19:48.950
I think we've realized as a civilization that we've had,

319
00:19:48.951 --> 00:19:52.550
that could have been a mistake in some ways that it's been utilized. Um,

320
00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:56.150
I think going forward people aren't, uh, how maybe they are, I don't know,

321
00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.260
maybe I'm thinking they aren't interested in using it as a weapon,

322
00:20:00.261 --> 00:20:04.430
but somebody is someone, but maybe to your point, Blofeld.

323
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:08.240
<v 1>No bond villain. There's always a bond villain out there,</v>

324
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:12.950
but ultimately I think enough people understand that, you know, to your point,

325
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:16.580
that learning from mistakes, yes, we, we do repeat history and make mistakes,

326
00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.210
but if we're able to solve auntie, it's not free energy,

327
00:20:20.211 --> 00:20:21.800
which a lot of people have talked about, you know,

328
00:20:21.801 --> 00:20:25.460
basically taking energy out of essentially the,

329
00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.240
the ether and being able to, because there's so much energy and such,

330
00:20:29.241 --> 00:20:30.230
we just haven't been able to.

331
00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.400
<v 2>It's not free energy, free energy you're out until we figured that out.</v>

332
00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:39.620
<v 1>So again, perhaps a Nobel prize in the future for both Peter and I, well,</v>

333
00:20:39.621 --> 00:20:42.230
I think, I think, I think it would be a shared Nobel prize.

334
00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.860
We'll let Liz know if her name is, is included on that.

335
00:20:45.861 --> 00:20:50.080
But I think if we're doing this show in five to 10 years,

336
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:53.740
there's been a massive amount of progress on the understanding anti-matter and

337
00:20:53.741 --> 00:20:54.580
how to harness energy.

338
00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:58.380
<v 2>Out of it. I hope. Well, why don't we, uh,</v>

339
00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:01.890
pick it up with Liz land out on the other side,

340
00:21:01.891 --> 00:21:05.550
in the extended audio podcasts. Now there's a link to that.

341
00:21:05.551 --> 00:21:07.960
If you're watching on the YouTube, on the.

342
00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:14.340
<v 1>Grandmother, if you're watching this on our YouTube,</v>

343
00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.200
there's a link to the extended.

344
00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:21.150
<v 2>Audio portion right below you. Now that's like I say, if you're watching,</v>

345
00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.300
if you're listening to the podcast right now, just keep listening.

346
00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.850
It just keeps going. You don't have to, you don't have to go anywhere. Yeah.

347
00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.740
<v 1>And you won't be sorry, because we,</v>

348
00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.350
I guarantee we're going to get into some super cool stuff with it.

349
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:32.101
<v 2>Oh yeah.</v>

350
00:21:32.101 --> 00:21:36.240
We'll talk more about the secrets of anti-matter and how to create it and the

351
00:21:36.241 --> 00:21:39.150
costs involved and what we can do with it.

352
00:21:39.151 --> 00:21:41.970
And there's a whole bunch more stuff to talk about.

353
00:21:41.971 --> 00:21:45.480
So you're going to want to click on that link, my friend, um,

354
00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:49.170
if you don't have enough time and, uh, you gotta go, so be it,

355
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.290
maybe you'll join us next week on what if discussed?

356
00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:57.780
<v 3>[Inaudible].</v>
