<v 0>Before we talk about science.</v>

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.910
We'd like to give a big shout out to our sponsors at vocal.

3
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.440
If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around a year,

4
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:24.570
it doesn't make a sound.

5
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.540
According to quantum theorists,

6
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.560
that tree might not even exist until it's observed.

7
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.690
So is our world just an illusion?

8
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.150
Why do some physicists believe that physical matter?

9
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.223
Isn't real.

10
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.720
What scientific experiments have changed our view of reality

11
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.140
and could everything we see just be a hallucination.

12
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.050
This is what if,

13
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.940
and here's what would happen if the world is only your illusion.

14
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:06.780
The great philosopher,

15
00:01:06.781 --> 00:01:11.100
Rene Descartes came to the profound conclusion that I think,

16
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.420
therefore I am,

17
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.100
he was searching for a universal truth that couldn't be disputed.

18
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.750
And the act of thinking was undeniable proof of physics distance.

19
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.480
Yet our understanding of existence and reality are still

20
00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:32.160
evolving in the worlds of quantum physics and neuroscience.

21
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.210
There are different theories about what reality is.

22
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.570
So what is reality?

23
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.630
If we dive deep into the quantum realm matter is made up of

24
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:50.400
subatomic particles. These particles, including protons, neutrons,

25
00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:54.270
and electrons are in a state of flux until they're observed.

26
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.460
In fact, at the quantum level, they may not even look like particles at all.

27
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.450
You could think of them as a cloud of probabilities.

28
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.360
This concept is known as a super position,

29
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.100
meaning a particle exists in several possible positions until they are

30
00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:11.934
measured.

31
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.370
The idea of superposition was famously observed in the double slit

32
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.730
experiment by physicist Thomas Young in 1801.

33
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.660
When we shine a beam of light through one slit,

34
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.790
it produces a predictable line of light. But when another slit is added,

35
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.130
something kind of spooky happens instead of two lines of light.

36
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.450
We see several,

37
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.000
the photons seem to act like a wave as if they were rippling through the

38
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:45.060
slits and bouncing off each other in different directions.

39
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.670
This interference pattern led scientists to believe that matter could act as

40
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:52.890
both particles and waves.

41
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.350
That was a profound idea that changed the world of physics forever.

42
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.430
So if things only exist when they're observed,

43
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.190
would black holes still exist?

44
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.080
If we hadn't measured their x-rays some physicists like max

45
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:15.970
Tegmark believe that black holes and everything we perceive to be real is

46
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.860
simply mathematical information.

47
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.620
This idea is known as information realism in the world

48
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:26.560
of philosophy. This idea of reality,

49
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:30.910
being a product of our observation is known as a phenomenal ism.

50
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.430
It States that anything we experience is simply sensory data in our

51
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:40.480
minds as if life itself is virtual reality.

52
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.130
Without the silly glasses,

53
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.980
if scientists were able to send signals to a living brain in a VAT,

54
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.990
simulating all the senses,

55
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.130
could we trick the brain to believe it's in a human body somewhere and

56
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.450
experiencing reality.

57
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.920
Maybe we could reprogram our ideas at the neural level.

58
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.200
Just imagine being able to fly anywhere you want, drive fancy cars,

59
00:04:05.201 --> 00:04:08.770
Dodge bullets, and live forever. Your pleasure,

60
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.630
your achievements and your level of success would only be limited by your

61
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:17.860
ability to imagine them some cognitive neuroscientists,

62
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:19.900
including professor Neil, Seth,

63
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.160
suggest that our brains are hallucinating reality all the time.

64
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.090
Have you ever had a dream that felt so real that you jolted awake,

65
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.670
feeling disoriented like that?

66
00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:34.000
One night when I thought I was stuck in a how to survive episode,

67
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.240
well,

68
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.160
our nightmares and our perceptions of reality are both processed in our brains,

69
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.080
visual cortex. This is why it can be hard to tell the difference between them.

70
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.560
You know,

71
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.210
maybe you could start a diary or a dream journal or a video blog and keep

72
00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:57.600
track of all your brain stories for content creators.

73
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.900
Vocal is a great platform for all kinds of stories.

74
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.060
It's an amazing community of bloggers, podcasters, YouTubers, and more.

75
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.680
Do you have a science themed YouTube channel like we do well,

76
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.660
you can promote and monetize your content on vocal.media to reach a

77
00:05:15.661 --> 00:05:18.570
whole new audience, vocal hosts,

78
00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:23.430
weekly challenges with chances to win cash prizes and more with

79
00:05:23.431 --> 00:05:27.210
over 30 different topic based communities. There's something for everyone.

80
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.500
Even us. We've been posting our, what if stories on vocal as well?

81
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.080
So check out the link below to learn more,

82
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.020
even though we can't exactly be sure what is real with

83
00:05:40.021 --> 00:05:43.200
rapid advancements in the world of physics and neuroscience,

84
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.640
we're getting closer to understanding the complexities of reality.

85
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.200
Maybe we'll crack the code someday. Speaking of coding,

86
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.120
could it be possible that we're just characters in some sort of computer?

87
00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:59.630
I mean,

88
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.460
video game graphics are looking pretty real these days on that

89
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:09.290
note computer load. What if sequence? Okay,

90
00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:10.124
Peter,

91
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.450
that's a story or another one.
