00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.990
<v 0>Nearly 800 million light years away,</v>

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.850
something has been forming scientists.

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.840
Aren't exactly sure what it is, but have dubbed it,

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.240
the black neutron star,

5
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.490
and now it's headed for earth.

6
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.330
What is this strange object?

7
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.540
How would it change our planet and what makes

8
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:32.510
this new discovery so dangerous?

9
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.480
This is what if,

10
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.490
and here's what would happen if a black neutron star entered our

11
00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:44.990
solar system? What is a black neutron star?

12
00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:49.820
Exactly. Well scientists aren't entirely sure just yet,

13
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.400
but they do have some theories.

14
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.810
It all has to do with this mass gap.

15
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.790
That's found in space when a star dies, two things can happen.

16
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.710
If the star is more than five times, the mass of the sun,

17
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.290
it becomes a black hole. And if it's under two and a half times,

18
00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:16.310
the mass of our sun, it becomes a neutron star.

19
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.640
But what exactly happens when a star is too small to become a black

20
00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:26.900
hole and too big to become a neutron star.

21
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.980
That's where our new space object comes in.

22
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.500
Scientists from the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory

23
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.120
and the European Virgo detector have discovered an object.

24
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.040
2.6 times,

25
00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:48.020
the mass of our sun scientists think there's a chance.

26
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.010
This object is either the heaviest neutron star ever,

27
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.920
or the smallest black hole,

28
00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.580
regardless of what it might be.

29
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.350
Scientists also discovered that this mysterious space object

30
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.730
merged with a black hole of 23 solar masses.

31
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.510
This happened 800 million light years away,

32
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:16.280
but the gravitational waves it created were detected here on

33
00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:17.114
earth.

34
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.850
This could have created the most massive black hole to ever exist.

35
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:26.840
But let's say this object, which is 2.6 times,

36
00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:30.230
the mass of our sun didn't merge with black hole.

37
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.280
Instead it came toward our solar system.

38
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.350
What would happen then? Well, yeah,

39
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.110
as the black neutron star came on the scene,

40
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.690
gravitational disturbances would disrupt nearly every object within the

41
00:02:47.691 --> 00:02:51.680
solar system. All planets, comets, asteroids,

42
00:02:51.681 --> 00:02:55.100
and everything else in space would be thrown into chaos.

43
00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.700
There's a good chance that this would throw the earth out of the habitable zone.

44
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.500
Our planet could end up wandering in the far corners of space

45
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.250
and with the planet being so far from the sun,

46
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.820
Earth's temperature would drop significantly.

47
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.300
Luckily, this wouldn't happen right away due to all the greenhouse gases in our

48
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:20.134
atmosphere,

49
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.580
but soon enough earth would become a frozen wasteland.

50
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.970
And since we're not entirely sure what this object is,

51
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.880
the results could be very different.

52
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.440
If the black neutron star were a kind of Magnetar,

53
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.000
then we would experience intense solar flares as well.

54
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.370
A Magnetar can release as much energy as our son is admitted in

55
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:52.030
100,000 years in less than one second,

56
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.510
as earth is completely frozen,

57
00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.070
it would then be quickly heated up as the black neutron star gets closer,

58
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.770
vaporizing nearly everything on the planet,

59
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.660
not to mention it would also cause tidal heating,

60
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.480
the strong gravitational pull coming from this massive space object would

61
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.750
deform earth by eating our planet's core.

62
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.120
This would also give rise to massive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

63
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.090
And what if the black neutron star were just a really small black hole?

64
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:29.380
Well,

65
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.910
the results of it entering our solar system wouldn't be any less destructive.

66
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.770
The black hole would slowly suck up everything in our solar system.

67
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.380
It would grow larger and larger making its way toward earth.

68
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.970
And once it gets to us, it's enormous,

69
00:04:48.971 --> 00:04:53.890
tidal force would pull earth apart and there's nothing we could

70
00:04:53.891 --> 00:04:54.724
do to stop it.

71
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.370
<v 1>There's.</v>

72
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.930
<v 0>Also a chance that this black neutron star could be a regular</v>

73
00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:04.420
neutron star that then becomes a black.

74
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.730
<v 1>Hole. This would.</v>

75
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.320
<v 0>Result in earth being quickly destroyed by all those consequences from before.</v>

76
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:12.783
And of course.

77
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.680
<v 1>Die. So, yeah, sorry,</v>

78
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.100
we killed you a bunch in this one, but it just goes to show that.

79
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.600
<v 0>We definitely wouldn't want these objects coming anywhere near us.</v>

80
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.660
<v 1>But what F.</v>

81
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.590
<v 0>Instead of a black neutron star entering our solar.</v>

82
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.200
<v 1>System, just a spoonful.</v>

83
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.600
<v 0>Of neutron star suddenly appeared on it.</v>

84
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.820
<v 1>Birth. Well,</v>

85
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.350
we'll leave that story for another. What if.
