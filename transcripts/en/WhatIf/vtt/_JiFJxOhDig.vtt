<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.280
<v 1>What if we took everything that sustains life on this planet</v>

3
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.390
and shrunk it down to one small bubble

4
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.100
earth,

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.080
biosphere stretches about 20 kilometers from the deep sea vents in

6
00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:24.410
the ocean, into the atmosphere.

7
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.610
This is where almost all life exists.

8
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.950
If we ever want to live in space or settled Mars,

9
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.510
we will have to recreate this extremely complex system.

10
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.360
What would you eat?

11
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.690
Would you have garbage and what would be the

12
00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:49.970
biggest threat to your health?

13
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.880
This is what if,

14
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.590
and here's what would happen if you lived in a closed biosphere?

15
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.120
We've tried this once before with disastrous results

16
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.850
in 1991,

17
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.130
eight scientists enclosed themselves in a huge research facility called

18
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.750
biosphere two.

19
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.920
This building was completely shut off from the outside world.

20
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.170
All the food air and water had to be produced and recycled

21
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.730
within its walls. But the experiment quickly began to fail.

22
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.940
There was not enough food or oxygen.

23
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.040
The pollinators died and roaches infested this mini

24
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.270
earth, but could we do it again?

25
00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:43.850
And this time succeed,

26
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.310
the Earth's biosphere is technically a closed system.

27
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.980
The only thing that enters the bias fear is a continuous flow of energy from

28
00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:55.814
the sun,

29
00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.980
but creating an earth leg biome is not as easy as it sounds

30
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.890
within Earth's biosphere,

31
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.470
our biomes communities of flora and fauna that occupy major

32
00:02:09.471 --> 00:02:14.000
types of habitats you'd need a collection of biomes to create a

33
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:15.380
successful life.

34
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:19.370
Supporting many worlds like biosphere two,

35
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.420
you'd be living in a 12,700 square meter facility,

36
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.680
which would contain a rainforest, an ocean with a coral reef,

37
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.050
mangrove wetlands, Savanna grassland, and a fog desert.

38
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.990
You would also need agricultural land and a place where you lived

39
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.910
and performed laboratory work.

40
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.570
As for your daily routine will be rough.

41
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.140
Keeping yourself alive would be a lot of work.

42
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.300
You spend almost 35% of your time on agriculture.

43
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.280
Then there's all the maintenance lab work and household chores.

44
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.080
Your diet would be mainly vegetarian.

45
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.660
It takes at least 25% more water to produce one kilogram of

46
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:10.960
meat than one kilogram of wheat,

47
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.160
because animals require a lot of resources.

48
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.940
You carefully select which ones to bring into your bias fear.

49
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.790
I suggest the African pygmy goat,

50
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.400
the most productive domestic animal in biosphere to its milk

51
00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:30.160
would be a welcome break from all the vegetables.

52
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:33.670
You'd be eating the crew of biosphere.

53
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.690
Two survived mostly on sweet potatoes and beets,

54
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.270
but you do a better job and successfully grow a hundred different

55
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:46.180
crops, including papaya and rice,

56
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.630
even with all your agricultural work,

57
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.430
starvation would be a real threat because your biome is so

58
00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:58.570
small. The slightest problem can ruin your food crop.

59
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.100
You could have unbalanced soil composition from adding waste,

60
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.080
pollinators, dying off pests, increasing disease.

61
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.350
Whole fields of food could be ruined leaving you very hungry

62
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.130
in the 1991 experiment,

63
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.580
working relentless hours facing constant hunger,

64
00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.840
created rifts within the small community to avoid this.

65
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.520
You'd need the perfect number of people to balance the other work and feed

66
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:31.800
production to few people.

67
00:04:31.801 --> 00:04:34.800
And you'd be overworked too many people,

68
00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:37.500
and there wouldn't be enough food to go around.

69
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.360
Wild crops would be a major focus of your attention.

70
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.160
You'd still need to tend to the rest of the biomes plants.

71
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.410
Wouldn't just be for eating after all.

72
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.780
They'd also produce oxygen and much like the Amazon rainforest

73
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.600
you'd need areas that are full of plant life.

74
00:04:57.601 --> 00:05:02.430
So you could breathe too little oxygen or carbon dioxide,

75
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.480
and you could be in trouble. It's tricky to balance them.

76
00:05:06.481 --> 00:05:07.920
And in biosphere,

77
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.730
two oxygen depletion became a huge issue.

78
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.130
Why they mixed too much organic matter into the soil.

79
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.720
This caused an explosion of oxygen eating microbes,

80
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.100
which decreased the amount of oxygen and the carbon

81
00:05:26.101 --> 00:05:30.480
dioxide produced by these microbes reacted to a chemical in the

82
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.943
biosphere's concrete.

83
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.540
So the plants couldn't use the extra carbon dioxide during

84
00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:40.380
photosynthesis. Luckily we learned from that mistake,

85
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.030
you'd make your biosphere. So it wouldn't react to carbon dioxide.

86
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.380
Okay, so you have enough food and oxygen. That's good,

87
00:05:49.381 --> 00:05:51.450
but what about waste?

88
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.090
It has to go somewhere and there's no room for landfills in your mini world.

89
00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.460
You'd have to compost all human and animal waste.

90
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.470
And remember this compost would increase the number of oxygen eating

91
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:10.460
microbes. So you'd need to plan for that while maintaining your biosphere,

92
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.520
everything you use would be reusable and it would

93
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.070
all have to be compostable.

94
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.180
You'd mend your clothing made out of cotton,

95
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.810
silk and wool many times then you'd use it for rags

96
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.980
then stuffing. And finally, you'd throw it on the compost heap.

97
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.500
You'd rely on technology to circulate air, pump water,

98
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.560
and constantly measure everything in the biosphere.

99
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.540
This takes power and your only options would be solar

100
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.580
nuclear war.

101
00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:51.260
Both earth is a vast complex system where

102
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.580
every living organism, including you and me are connected,

103
00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.890
recreating that on any scale is a gargantuan task.

104
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.100
And we'll have to master this process.

105
00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:08.110
If we ever want to settle Mars or create cities on the moon,

106
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:13.850
want to learn more about living in enclosed biosphere? Join us on.

107
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:15.020
What if discussed?

108
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.940
We talked with Jane Poynter one of the original eight members of

109
00:07:19.941 --> 00:07:23.780
biosphere. Two. She'll tell us more about the biology,

110
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.610
the oxygen problem,

111
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.080
and the psychology of living in a closed biosphere.
