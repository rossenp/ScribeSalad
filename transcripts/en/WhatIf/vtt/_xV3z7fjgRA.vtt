00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.010
<v 0>What if I told you,</v>

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.720
we discovered an alien species with an

3
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:08.010
adaptable body,

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.170
advanced intelligence and astounding

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.000
camouflage skills, enter the octopus.

6
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.470
Wait, what did you think I was talking about? Right.

7
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.960
Could these slithery ocean dwellers be from outer

8
00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:30.794
space?

9
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.740
Where did they come from and how did they get to

10
00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:40.460
earth? This is what if,

11
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.650
and here's what would happen if octopuses are aliens from outer

12
00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:48.050
space. All right.

13
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.060
It's time to put your tin foil helmet on because today we're getting

14
00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:54.230
a little out there.

15
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.570
Octopuses are as cool as they are mysterious.

16
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.490
So mysterious that some scientists are putting the theory forward,

17
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.860
that they aren't even from our planet.

18
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.200
Octopuses are incredibly intelligent creatures and are

19
00:01:12.201 --> 00:01:13.700
masters of disguises.

20
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.180
They can use their color changing cells to blend in with the environment,

21
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.710
move their arms,

22
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:26.570
to impersonate other ocean species and are excellent problem

23
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.033
solvers.

24
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.410
So what if they're so smart that they've pulled a fast one on

25
00:01:33.411 --> 00:01:34.244
all of us?

26
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.170
What if they're really aliens and have only convinced us that they

27
00:01:39.171 --> 00:01:43.310
originated here on earth? It's genetics.

28
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.890
Absolutely. Unearthly.

29
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.170
The theory goes that 500 million years ago, an icy media,

30
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.470
right? Carrying an alien life form fell to earth.

31
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.820
This life form fertilized octopus, eggs,

32
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.190
mind blown case closed. Thanks for watching.

33
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.940
Be sure to like and subscribe. Okay. Can see you're skeptical.

34
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:10.250
So let's go a little deeper.

35
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.770
You're probably asking how the heck is an alien life form going to survive in

36
00:02:15.771 --> 00:02:20.000
the cold reaches of space before getting to earth. Well,

37
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.740
here's the thing microbes such as those seen in bacteria are

38
00:02:24.741 --> 00:02:26.120
extremely tough.

39
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.820
Microbes can thrive in temperatures as low as minus 18 degrees

40
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.320
and can even be preserved in liquid nitrogen at minus

41
00:02:36.321 --> 00:02:38.810
196 degrees.

42
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.510
This means that they couldn't care less about the extreme pressures of space.

43
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.060
And in theory could float around for billions of years before

44
00:02:50.061 --> 00:02:50.894
hitting a planet.

45
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.840
But if the octopus did crash land on earth 500 million

46
00:02:56.841 --> 00:03:01.000
years ago, where did it come? Well,

47
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.390
we know the octopus is a water creature, so let's start there.

48
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.620
Our bet is Europa. One of Jupiter's moons.

49
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.990
Europa has an icy exterior and might have a liquid ocean underneath

50
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.400
seems like a cozy space for an interplanetary octopus, right?

51
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.740
Could a massive asteroid have smashed into Europa 500 million years

52
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:28.330
ago, resulting in huge chunks of debris being torn out into space.

53
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.520
And if so, could some of that debris have held octopus eggs in it?

54
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.460
The answer is maybe call me Fox Mulder because I

55
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:40.450
want to believe,

56
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.340
but this is some really far out stuff is calling an

57
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:49.540
octopus, an alien. The only way to explain them. I mean,

58
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.990
we have plenty of weird creatures on earth without extra terrestrial

59
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:55.990
interference. In 2015,

60
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.200
scientists were able to map the genome of the octopus.

61
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.510
Did they find some surprises? Sure they did, but an alien origin story.

62
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.280
Wasn't one of them the most significant discovery was that their genes

63
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.450
split off from squids about 135 million years ago,

64
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.320
which is long after they allegedly crashed into earth.

65
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.440
So could octopuses really be from outer space? Well,

66
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.200
it's a fascinating theory, but as of today,

67
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.450
it doesn't have the science to back it up.

68
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.200
And even though they're not from outer space,

69
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.110
it doesn't mean we can't still learn from them,

70
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.870
but don't take our word for it.

71
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.700
Ask award-winning environmental journalists and the director of the documentary,

72
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:47.020
my octopus teacher PIPA, girlish. Join us on.

73
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.550
What if discussed to take a deeper dive into the world of these

74
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:53.050
fascinating creatures?

75
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.080
