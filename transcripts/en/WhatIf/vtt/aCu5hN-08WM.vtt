00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.290
<v 0>Dry ice is one of the coldest substances earth.</v>

2
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.350
This is what it does to a flower and check out

3
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.160
what it does to this action figure. Ouch.

4
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.410
Now what would happen if you swallow dry ice,

5
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.680
what would it do to your skin?

6
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.500
How much could you eat before it hurts you and

7
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.840
how would it affect your stomach?

8
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.660
This is what if and here what would happen if you ate a

9
00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:40.490
brick of dry ice?

10
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.610
Dry ice is a solid form of carbon dioxide and it's as

11
00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:49.820
cold as minus 78 degrees grease.

12
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.630
And sometimes people eat this stuff.

13
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.300
It's an ingredient that's occasionally used in cocktails and ice creams,

14
00:00:59.301 --> 00:01:02.750
but it's only safe in tiny doses.

15
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.370
So now, instead of having it mixed with other foods,

16
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.950
what would happen if you ate an entire brick of dry ice,

17
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.230
but first, how would you get it? Well,

18
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.400
you could just buy it,

19
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.590
but let's try making some on our own dry ice

20
00:01:24.591 --> 00:01:26.780
comes from carbon dioxide gas.

21
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.220
This gas can be as cold as minus 56 degrees,

22
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.130
but for it to become dry ice,

23
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.390
it needs to be even colder. And to do that,

24
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.030
it needs to be pressurized and cooled.

25
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.370
When it's released from the mold back to normal atmospheric pressure,

26
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.770
it forms liquid carbon dioxide. And now that we have our liquid,

27
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.860
it's injected into a block press,

28
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.660
which converts the liquid into a solid, okay,

29
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.600
now we have our dry ice. What happens now?

30
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.000
Well, now that you have your brick of dry ice, before you put it in your mouth,

31
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.770
you first want to touch it.

32
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.820
If you were to just poke the dry ice with your finger,

33
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.110
it would come back red with a slight prickling sensation to it

34
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.680
that wasn't so bad. Okay.

35
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.490
So why not try picking it up with your hands? Well,

36
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.020
because after just a few seconds of having the dry ice in your hands,

37
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.160
your skin cells would start to freeze and then die.

38
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.520
If you kept it in your hands any longer,

39
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.980
your skin would begin to turn blue and gray and eventually

40
00:02:45.981 --> 00:02:50.450
you'd lose all sensation in your hands. And now,

41
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.470
after learning about how damaging this can be to your body,

42
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.970
you're still curious enough to see what would happen if you ate this brick of

43
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.400
ice, are you serious? Okay, fine.

44
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.980
So as soon as you ingested the dry ice,

45
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.150
you'd immediately feel the same sensation you did on your hand,

46
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.010
but in your mouth,

47
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.920
your tongue and mouth tissue would begin to sting and feel incredibly numb.

48
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.410
And don't forget about your teeth.

49
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.660
You know how bad it feels when you chew ice cream. Yeah. Imagine that,

50
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.000
but much, much worse.

51
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.740
Your entire mouth would be frozen in a matter of seconds.

52
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:39.220
And the longer you kept the dry ice in your mouth, well,

53
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.630
it would only get worse.

54
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.710
Eventually you'd lose feeling in your mouth forever,

55
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.870
but we're not even close to being finished with the dry ice yet.

56
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.000
You still need to swallow it. As the dry ice went down,

57
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:58.120
your esophagus you'd feel a little tingling there.

58
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.390
And then it would travel down to your stomach.

59
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.760
As it's in your stomach,

60
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.200
the dry ice would heat up and form gaseous carbon dioxide.

61
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.660
This is because as dry ice heats up, it doesn't become a liquid,

62
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:18.040
but rather a gas, hence the name, dry ice.

63
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.070
And with this gas in your stomach,

64
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.880
you'd start to feel bloated and then a sharp pain.

65
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.930
And don't forget about the frost bite on your stomach lining.

66
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.920
Luckily you could burn some of this gas out of you

67
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.520
relieving some of the pressure you'd be feeling,

68
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.730
but if you continue to eat dry ice,

69
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.620
the pressure from the gas would continue to build your stomach would

70
00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:48.880
expand and get harder as the pressure continued.

71
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.560
Your stomach would rupture. At this point,

72
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.320
you'd experienced severe pain and vomiting.

73
00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.360
If you didn't get to the hospital immediately, you die. Oh,

74
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.100
so please don't try this at home.

75
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.530
Let's just keep dry ice to cool party tricks and something you'd occasionally

76
00:05:11.531 --> 00:05:12.460
see in your ice cream,

77
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.720
dry ice is definitely something you don't want to eat,

78
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.990
but what about something like gallium?

79
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.810
Well, that sounds like a story for another. What if.
