<v 1>Sanitation company disposes of its waste by dumping it into the Amazon</v>

3
00:00:08.421 --> 00:00:13.280
river. And unfortunately they're not the only ones

4
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.790
All over the world. People are treating bodies of water,

5
00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:22.370
like they're giant garbage dumps.

6
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.380
And experts say that continuing these practices will result in

7
00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:29.810
catastrophic damage to Marine life.

8
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.520
But what if we're just not dumping our trash in water?

9
00:00:34.521 --> 00:00:35.570
That's deep enough.

10
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.480
What if we dumped our trash down in the deepest part of the ocean,

11
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.000
would the immense pressure down there act as a natural trash compactor?

12
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.340
How would all that garbage affect the rest of the ocean?

13
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.730
This is what F and here's what would happen if we sunk our trash

14
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.350
into the Mariana trench,

15
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.340
the Mariana trench is a vast crack in the earth,

16
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.530
deep in the bottom of the Pacific ocean.

17
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.610
It's deepest point is 11 kilometers below sea level.

18
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.250
The trench is so big that we could theoretically keep stuffing a trash away

19
00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:21.290
there for thousands of years,

20
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.240
but only three people have ever made it down to the bottom of the trench.

21
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.760
So how likely is it that we could get all the world's trash down there

22
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.090
before we dive too deeply into that?

23
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.390
Let's find out how much trash we're talking about.

24
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.520
We produce over 2 billion, tons of waste every year,

25
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.890
and this is expected to increase to almost three and a half billion tons

26
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.220
by the year 2050, to put it in perspective,

27
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.440
that would be 1000 times the volume of the great pyramid of Giza

28
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.110
to get rid of the waste.

29
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.520
We've tried things like throwing it into landfills and burning it up.

30
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.280
But neither of these are working out too well,

31
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.190
both landfills and garbage incinerators release toxins that leach into our

32
00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:18.020
soil air and groundwater becoming long-term hazards to our environment

33
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.310
and to our safety.

34
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.330
So it's time to get creative and try something new.

35
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.600
And that brings us to the Mariana trench.

36
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.590
The trench is so vast that it could hold as much as

37
00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:34.790
970,000 billion tons of waste.

38
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.490
That's enough to allow us to keep stuffing away.

39
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:39.740
The world's trash for thousands of years.

40
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.190
The pressure in the trench is also very high.

41
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.530
It's comparable to the pressure that a tower of 2000 elephants would exert

42
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.500
on a surface smaller than one square meter.

43
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.240
We could use that pressure to our advantage has it will compress any waste we

44
00:02:56.241 --> 00:02:57.074
put down there.

45
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.450
It would be like when a car crusher compresses a car,

46
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.650
this would allow us to put even more trash into the trench.

47
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.750
Now, all we have to do is figure out a way to get our waste down there.

48
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.380
One option would be to transport the waste down there using a submarine,

49
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.640
but that would be very expensive for comparison.

50
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.010
The submarine used to bring filmmaker,

51
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:27.670
James Cameron to the bottom of the trench costs $10 million,

52
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:30.250
and only one person could fit in that stuff.

53
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.370
A better solution would be to use a pipe system similar to the waste pipes

54
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:41.200
that some construction scaffolds use the garbage pipes would have to withstand

55
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:43.000
the high pressure of the ocean floor.

56
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.980
And their paths would have to be carefully planned to account for different

57
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:49.270
depths along the trench.

58
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.200
But even if we could get all our trash down there,

59
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.200
would it be a good solution for our waste problem?

60
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.370
It doesn't matter what part of the ocean we dump our trash into.

61
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:05.320
It's still going to cause pollution waste is filled with dangerous metals,

62
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.090
chemicals, and microplastics that can leak out into its surroundings.

63
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.310
These chemicals and microplastics could be passed on to us humans through the

64
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:18.820
fish, weed, the water we drink, and even the air we breathe.

65
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.860
So rather than finding new places to dump our garbage,

66
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.340
maybe we could focus on trying to produce less of it.

67
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:31.720
Instead the zero waste movement is already picking up speed.

68
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.690
Can you imagine how quickly our planet would recover if we produced no waste

69
00:04:37.691 --> 00:04:39.820
at all? Well,

70
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.330
that's a story for another one.
