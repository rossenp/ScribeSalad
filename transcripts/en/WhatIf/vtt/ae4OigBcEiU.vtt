00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.220
<v 0>If the earth had an edge, I hope it would look like this,</v>

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.380
the edge of a flat earth. I know,

3
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:15.330
I know we've talked about it before, but there's something mesmerizing about it.

4
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.360
A flat earth, solar eclipse, diagonally growing trees,

5
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.370
the great wall of ice guarded by NASA. Of course,

6
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.050
the flat earthers. Sure. Have a great imagination,

7
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.140
but what if they were right?

8
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.890
How would the earth hold up in space?

9
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.710
Would it revolve around the sun or would the sun rotate around

10
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:44.544
it?

11
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.260
And why would you never walk to the Earth's edge?

12
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.040
This is what F and here's what would happen if the earth was

13
00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:56.874
flat

14
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.010
in case you missed the news on the flat earth channel.

15
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.030
Here's a quick recap for thousands of years,

16
00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:10.740
the general public thought that the earth was flat and everything

17
00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:11.820
revolved around it.

18
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.040
Then Nicolaus Copernicus came around with his spanking new theory.

19
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.680
The theory said that the earth wasn't flat and definitely

20
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.480
not the center of anything.

21
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.820
His observations led him to believe that our planet is orbiting.

22
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.713
The sun

23
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.210
here we are 500 years later.

24
00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:39.890
And some people around the globe are convinced that the earth is flat.

25
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.920
Well, how would this even work?

26
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.290
Do you know why the planets form in a spiritual shape,

27
00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.810
one word gravity,

28
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.120
gravity is what's pulling matter together equally from every side.

29
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.730
And as a result matter forms into a sphere, of course,

30
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.770
this wouldn't be the case for a flat earth tie round. Earthers.

31
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.020
Think that there's no such thing as great gravity.

32
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.150
We only feel like there is because some mysterious force is accelerating the

33
00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:16.100
pancake shaped earth upwards.

34
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.390
I don't need to tell you that you can't increase the speed forever.

35
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.690
At some point you'd be going too fast.

36
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.130
Does anybody feel like a Burke pancake? Nope.

37
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.530
If you want some real science, then yes,

38
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.270
there would be gravity on a flat earth and it would be

39
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.703
weird.

40
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.780
The center of gravity on a flat earth would be right here in the middle.

41
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.940
Everything on earth and around would be pulled to this point.

42
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.040
And the further you got away from the center, the stronger this pole would be.

43
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.150
At some point, it would begin to pull you downward.

44
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.910
So you would have to start climbing.

45
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.040
This would be the reason why you couldn't walk to the edge of a flat earth.

46
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.080
Gravity would be so strong around there that it would be impossible for you to

47
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:11.914
make it.

48
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.330
You might never see the gorgeous 45 meter,

49
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:21.250
tall wall of ice called an Arctica guard, railing the Earth's edge.

50
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.910
And you'd never learn what's on the flip side,

51
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.760
but at least you wouldn't fall off of it.

52
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.910
There would be other side effects of this funny gravity objects closer to

53
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:37.750
the edge of the earth would fall sideways. Instead of down,

54
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.020
gravity would also make trees grow diagonally on most of the pancake

55
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.220
Legere, because they'd be reaching against the pull of gravity.

56
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.310
All the rain,

57
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.810
snow and hail would fall toward the Arctic at the center of the earth.

58
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.590
The precipitation would converge and start to build up.

59
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.620
The oceans would get sucked to the center of the disc to and form one big

60
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.760
ocean in the middle.

61
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.980
A big concern would be the air pressure on a flat earth.

62
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.990
Gravity would draw too much air toward the earth center,

63
00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.160
leaving the areas around the edge with no air pressure at all.

64
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.070
That would be bad because people living in a flat earth Australia wouldn't have

65
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:28.390
enough oxygen to breathe.

66
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.500
And if you lived closer to the middle where the Arctic would be,

67
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.440
you'd be crushed by the weight of the atmosphere,

68
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.020
but not for long,

69
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.520
a flat earth wouldn't have a geomagnetic field around it.

70
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.980
This field is generated by the movements of the Earth's core and well,

71
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.930
a flat earth just wouldn't have one.

72
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.620
Nothing would be holding our atmosphere in place,

73
00:04:53.621 --> 00:04:56.890
and eventually it would spill into space.

74
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.410
We'd be exposed to solar radiation that would cause cancer and damage our

75
00:05:02.411 --> 00:05:06.910
DNA and we'd have no breathable air anywhere on the planet.

76
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.890
So I hope you're able to find a life support system lying around.

77
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.030
Now, let's get to those questions. We've all been waiting for.

78
00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.490
What would orbit,

79
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.410
what in this arrangement would there be a day and night cycle

80
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.090
or time zones, every flat earth,

81
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.860
or knows that the sun goes in circles around a pancake shaped earth.

82
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.270
And so does the moon.

83
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.520
They're both around 50 kilometers in diameter and act like you've

84
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.140
spotlights, but let's bring good old science to the equation.

85
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.990
If the sun work as a spotlight, you see it from everywhere on earth.

86
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.990
Even if it didn't shine directly on you,

87
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.050
it would look like those alien abduction scenes. Hmm.

88
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.610
I wonder where they got that idea from

89
00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.930
in this system. There would be no day and night cycle.

90
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.010
That would be pretty strange. Oh, how am I supposed to get my beauty sleep?

91
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.020
Okay. I know how to fix this. Yeah,

92
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.000
that's better for a flat earth to have days alternating with

93
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.200
nights, the sun would have to orbit the planet this way.

94
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.300
When the sun was up, the entire planet of earth would experience daylight.

95
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.650
And when the sun went down, the earth would fall into nighttime.

96
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.120
There would be no time zones and no seasons either,

97
00:06:40.121 --> 00:06:44.890
but you could still mess up your schedule by staying up late and watching

98
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.273
videos.

99
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.790
You'd be lucky if the sun was so much smaller than the earth,

100
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.850
sort of think of this.

101
00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:00.070
If the sun retained its gigantic form, as it was orbiting a flat earth,

102
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.440
it would burn down the entire planet.

103
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.350
That's because of how close it would get to them.

104
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.370
On the other hand, if the sun were much smaller than it really is,

105
00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.290
we'd freeze to death.

106
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.720
That's because the flat earth would have nearly two and a half times.

107
00:07:19.721 --> 00:07:22.120
The surface area of our rounder.

108
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.790
We'd be getting only one third of a regular sized sun's energy.

109
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.600
That's not enough for life on a flat earth to exist.

110
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.720
And we haven't even talked about this yet. The lunar eclipse

111
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.900
flat earth disciples believe in some kind of anti moon.

112
00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.170
That's responsible for these on our round earth.

113
00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:51.550
Lunar eclipses happen when the earth lines up between the sun and the moon.

114
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.430
If that was the case for a flat earth,

115
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.280
this is how those eclipses might look.

116
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.850
And even that would require some very special things.

117
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.580
So if the flat earth conspiracy turned out to be true,

118
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:12.220
that our globe was indeed photo-shopped and GPS devices were

119
00:08:12.221 --> 00:08:15.220
rigged for some financial game. Well,

120
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.150
that would open up a conversation to other conspiracy theories.

121
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.730
Unfortunately, many people,

122
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.560
including the flat earthers are living in a state of cognitive dissonance.

123
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:32.020
That's when their thoughts and beliefs aren't quite consistent and don't always

124
00:08:32.021 --> 00:08:34.840
represent reality. I mean,

125
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:39.970
we are constantly exposed to pseudo evidence that can support any theory at

126
00:08:39.971 --> 00:08:44.020
all. Even if it falls flat with the bit of logical thinking.

127
00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:50.260
If Copernicus had spent 10 hours on YouTube watching flat earth conspiracy

128
00:08:50.261 --> 00:08:53.650
videos, even he might've been committed, he was wrong.

129
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:59.010
And have you seen an earth shaped like a donut?

130
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:05.190
Well, that's a story for a mother. What if

131
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.480
I might've overused the word round in this one?

132
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:14.760
[inaudible].
