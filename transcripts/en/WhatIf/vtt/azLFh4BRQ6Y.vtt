00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.093
<v 0>Hello,</v>

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.270
welcome to the U S S S where we drink vodka for

3
00:00:08.271 --> 00:00:09.104
breakfast,

4
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.450
where we cuddle our pet bears in our backyards and where instead of taking

5
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.290
a morning shower, we jump in a frozen Lake.

6
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:20.743
I see.

7
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.240
So is anyone going to tell me how on earth we got here?

8
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.050
When did the history go so wrong?

9
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.840
What does the moon have to do with all this? Should I brush up on my Russian?

10
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.390
This is what if,

11
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.070
and here's what would happen if Russia won the space race?

12
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.190
Remember those wild 1950s Russia,

13
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.930
formerly known as the Soviet union launched a satellite into space for the first

14
00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:58.340
time followed by the launch of their first Astro dog. Laika.

15
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.990
Great start by the Russians,

16
00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.890
but lost some points there for not bringing life back home safely.

17
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.030
The U S began to catch up with its own satellite Explorer. One.

18
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.350
They threw in the Apollo program and a big moon speech for good measure.

19
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.980
It's all or nothing. 1961.

20
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.210
The USSR sent the first man into space. Impressive.

21
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.780
The U S team sent their first man into space. Nice.

22
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.670
1963,

23
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.840
the first woman a Russian went to space beat that NASA

24
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.640
1968. Unbelievable. They're about to set foot on the moon.

25
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.080
Here goes one small step for man one giant leap for

26
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.310
Russia. Yep. You heard me.

27
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.800
I'm about to give you a history lesson,

28
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.540
a hypothetical history lesson in which Neil Armstrong.

29
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.330
Wasn't the first astronaut to walk on the moon.

30
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.760
Wouldn't have been too bad. If the USSR had one space race, right?

31
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.300
How much would things really change?

32
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.630
Well in the spirit of the cold war,

33
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.350
the nation that won the space race would control the earth.

34
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.860
And in this alternate timeline,

35
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.710
it was Russia who had the control button.

36
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.880
By the time Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon.

37
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.760
NASA's funds had started to dry up.

38
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.890
People just didn't see why they should be paying for some far-fetched space

39
00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:34.760
exploration. Unlike the democratic United States,

40
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.360
socialist Soviet Russia wouldn't have stopped there.

41
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.170
They'd have had all the funds and the workforce,

42
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.930
not only to come back to the moon multiple times,

43
00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:49.550
but also to establish a lunar base on it. Sure.

44
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.680
They'd have to boost their computing power.

45
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.820
Even if that meant stealing some of the American technology

46
00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:58.820
for the United,

47
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.330
the Soviets landing on the moon would have been quite shocking. And from there,

48
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.970
it all could go in two ways,

49
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.590
the Americans would have to catch up and they'd have to do it fast.

50
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.810
And where would you go if the moon was already housing, communist,

51
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:19.840
Russians to Mars, of course,

52
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.300
the next big defining moment of the space race would have been landing on Mars.

53
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.170
It would most likely be an unmanned probe. At first,

54
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.440
maybe a satellite sent into the orbit of Mars.

55
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.970
The Russians would have been rushing to get the first man craft to the Martian

56
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:37.511
surface.

57
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:42.220
And the Americans would have had to try hard to beat their communist adversary.

58
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.100
By the end of the 1980s,

59
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.120
humanity might have put the first astronauts on the red planet,

60
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.920
but who would have been the first to plant a flag on its cold surface?

61
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.690
Whoever that would have been that country would have claimed the title of

62
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:00.490
leading outer space Explorer,

63
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.410
but it wouldn't have meant that in the case of Russia taking the lead,

64
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.510
that the us would have become a socialist state or that the whole world would

65
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:11.530
end up speaking Russian.

66
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.030
It probably didn't hurt to have a Russian English phrase book just in case.

67
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.280
There are only so many places you can send humans to explore relatively

68
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:22.114
safely.

69
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.500
The majority of outer space would be studied through unmanned probes.

70
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.320
The tight space race would have resulted in all technology developing at a much

71
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.740
faster rate. And by the 2020s,

72
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.690
we would be taking vacations on the moon and on Mars,

73
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.490
that is if things had taken a different turn after the first moon landing,

74
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.800
alternatively,

75
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.360
after the Russians had beaten the United States to landing on the lunar surface,

76
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.920
the U S could have admitted their loss and stepped back. I mean,

77
00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.530
if the Americans hadn't become the first in space will,

78
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.750
why bother paying to be the second?

79
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.890
And as the Russians lost their primary challenger,

80
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.070
they could have lost interest in space, travel all together.

81
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.320
And in that case,

82
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.940
the alternative history wouldn't be much different than what it is today.

83
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.280
But while these two Titans were caught up in their contentious relationship,

84
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.600
they could have missed what some other countries were up to.

85
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.380
But that's a story or another.

86
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.660
<v 1>What if.</v>
