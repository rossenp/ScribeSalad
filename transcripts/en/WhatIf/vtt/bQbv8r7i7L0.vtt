1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.410
<v 0>This is the longest underwater pipe on earth.</v>

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.210
It stretches to the bottom of the deepest place on the planet.

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.870
We are only a few people have ever visited.

4
00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.360
And we're about to take you on an Epic journey to constructing

5
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.560
what materials would be suitable for the task.

6
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.220
What creatures would lurk around you.

7
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.830
And at what point would constructing the pipe become

8
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.150
unbearable.

9
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.970
<v 1>This.</v>

10
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:36.810
<v 0>Is what if,</v>

11
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.030
and here's what would happen if you built a pipe to the bottom of the Mariana

12
00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:42.440
trench?

13
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.273
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.550
<v 0>There's a reason why only a few people have ever made it to the bottom of the</v>

15
00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:52.220
Mariana trench. Let me tell you,

16
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.710
it's not the most pleasant of trips.

17
00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.370
The deepest part of the trench called the challenger deep fits the Mark at

18
00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:05.600
11 kilometers. No light makes it that deep.

19
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.610
And the temperature is just a few degrees above freezing.

20
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.760
If you were to dive down this deep with, or without a protective suit,

21
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.770
the pressure would crush you.

22
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.900
It would feel as if you had 100 elephants standing on your head

23
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.160
or as if you piled five blue whales on your shoulders.

24
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.650
That's what I call being under pressure.

25
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:32.773
<v 1>So.</v>

26
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.820
<v 0>How would we go about constructing a pipe in an environment where no</v>

27
00:01:37.821 --> 00:01:38.654
human can

28
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.350
Let's start from the beginning, building a pipeline.

29
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.200
This would require a lot of planning,

30
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.660
preparation and millions of dollars.

31
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.090
You'd be aiming for a pipe that could withstand pressure 1000 times greater

32
00:01:59.091 --> 00:02:01.550
than our normal atmospheric pressure.

33
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.000
What materials would even stand a chance?

34
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.580
I could suggest steel since that's what most water pipes are made of.

35
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.310
It's durable and cost-effective,

36
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.320
but transporting 11 kilometers of pipe into the ocean as one

37
00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:20.600
piece would be next to impossible.

38
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.940
You might be better off with polyester or vinyl resin pipe.

39
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.650
You could reinforce it with fiberglass and assemble it under water.

40
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.510
When you get to a depth that would crush the fiberglass,

41
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.040
you could add some steel. Well, that's the plan.

42
00:02:40.041 --> 00:02:42.350
Now let's see how it would play out.

43
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.490
As you descended 200 meters underwater,

44
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.740
you'd leave the epipelagic zone and find yourself in the mess of

45
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:55.574
pelagic zone.

46
00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.460
Those are the top two of five oceanic layers.

47
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.040
Your lungs would be getting compressed as you descended deeper and deeper,

48
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.490
but it would still be doable at this point.

49
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.470
As long as you were wearing a pressure suit, it would be dark,

50
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.760
but you'd see twinkling lights. Once your eyes adjusted to the darkness,

51
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.580
those would be the bioluminescent animals that call the mess of pelagic zone.

52
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.533
Their home.

53
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.943
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

54
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.310
<v 0>At 1000 meters, you'd entered the bath, the pelagic zone of the ocean,</v>

55
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.470
and you'd better get into a submarine because no pressure suit would be able to

56
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.210
keep you from getting crushed. Now, from this point on underwater,

57
00:03:45.211 --> 00:03:48.120
robots would take over the construction and maintenance.

58
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.730
The pipe itself would need to be getting thicker so that it could bear the

59
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.290
increasing water pressure.

60
00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.720
And you need a powerful flashlight because the only visible light

61
00:04:00.721 --> 00:04:03.870
down there is produced by creatures themselves.

62
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.780
You descend deeper and hit the 4,000 meter Mark.

63
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.980
At this point, you'd enter the abyssal pelagic. So

64
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.290
now you truly see what dark looks like.

65
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.300
No light at all can make it down to the abyssal pelagic territory

66
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.900
and the water temperature is near freezing.

67
00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:30.450
So very few animals live here.

68
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.290
You'd be lucky to see a few tiny squid.

69
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.653
<v 1>[Inaudible].</v>

70
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.360
<v 0>Okay. You're in the home stretch.</v>

71
00:04:42.361 --> 00:04:46.920
Now in the waters of the Haydel pelagic zone in the deepest,

72
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.630
the darkest, the most unexplored place on earth.

73
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.720
I wouldn't recommend you descend all the way down at the bottom of the

74
00:04:57.721 --> 00:05:02.160
Mariana trench. The pressure is about 1100 ATM.

75
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.040
That's the feeling of 100 elephants standing on your head,

76
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.330
building a pipe here. It would be challenging.

77
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.460
You'd need to send some very durable robots to the bottom of the trench

78
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.260
because these depths can implode even the toughest of them.

79
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.430
On top of enduring, extremely high pressure.

80
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.050
They'd have to be able to withstand the temperatures of just above freezing.

81
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.650
Nothing larger than three centimeters can live in this dark cold and

82
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.050
absolutely hostile environment.

83
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.250
So get cozy and let the robots finish the pipe.

84
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.600
And while you're up there controlling the robots,

85
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.150
watch out for those mags,

86
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.680
but that's a story for another.

87
00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.710
What if before you go onto your next hypothetical adventure,

88
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.000
I want to show you something we're really excited about this. My friends is the,
