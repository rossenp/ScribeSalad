00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.830
<v 0>Are you ready for the trip of a lifetime?</v>

2
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.560
Because this not so little machine is about to take you on one,

3
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.620
a trip back in time.

4
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.780
What would you need for this time travel to happen?

5
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.660
How would it mess with your body and what do

6
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.850
black holes have to do with all this? This is what if,

7
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.110
and here's what would happen if you built a tip blur time machine,

8
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.043
theoretically,

9
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.730
building a time-traveling device is possible or almost possible.

10
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.310
All you'd need to do is to assemble an enormous cylinder and get yourself for

11
00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:47.144
spaceship.

12
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.410
Then you'd need to figure out how to make the cylinder spin at a few billion

13
00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:52.400
rotations per minute.

14
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.340
And remember when I said it was enormous well for this cylinder to

15
00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:01.310
work hits, length would need to be infinite.

16
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.160
Before I get into the explanation of how this time machine works.

17
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.260
Let me give you a bit of a backstory. In 1915,

18
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.770
Albert Einstein came up with his theory of general relativity.

19
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.180
He claimed that our universe can be described by four dimensions.

20
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.250
The first three would be the dimensions of space and the fourth would be

21
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:29.090
time together. Their space time,

22
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.390
gravity can bend space, time,

23
00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:35.450
like a bowling ball would bend a rubber sheet.

24
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.520
The bending of space time makes time smooth.

25
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.330
The passage of time also changes depending on how fast you move.

26
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.280
The theory of general relativity blew people's minds.

27
00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:54.500
But in 1974,

28
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.570
Frank Tiddler realized that solutions to equations of general relativity

29
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.050
could be used to build a time-traveling nice.

30
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.140
Now that you're all caught up, let's start building this machine already.

31
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.000
First.

32
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.650
You'd need to find material with the total mass of about 10 sons

33
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.300
where you'd find all that matter is a big question, of course,

34
00:02:20.301 --> 00:02:25.010
but let's assume you manage to strip all the neighboring star systems and

35
00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:27.890
assemble them into a cylinder somewhere above the earth.

36
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.480
10 solar masses worth of matter is no joke.

37
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.700
It would take up a lot of space and you would have to figure out how to compress

38
00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:38.534
all that matter.

39
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.330
It would have to be so dense that it would turn into an elongated black hole.

40
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.960
There's no time to worry about getting sucked into it.

41
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.410
Now that you finally assembled a tickler cylinder,

42
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.580
you'd need to make it rotate at an unimaginably fast rate,

43
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.340
a few billion times every minute, theoretically,

44
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.970
instead of condensing a whole lot of matter into a black hole,

45
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.760
and then having to deal with the cylinder rotation.

46
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.670
You could just find a few neutron stars.

47
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.490
Those are leftovers from gigantic stars that didn't have enough mass

48
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:20.110
to collapse into black holes, and they rotate pretty fast.

49
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.740
You could line a few of them up and synchronize their rotation,

50
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.020
but even if you chose the fastest ones, their rotation,

51
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:32.260
wouldn't come close to a few billion times for a minute.

52
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.840
Besides we did an earlier video about trying to bring a spoonful of neutron

53
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:40.210
star back to earth, and it didn't

54
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.160
Anyway, regardless of how you achieve this effect,

55
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.530
the massive gravitational pull of the cylinder combined with the fast rotation

56
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.030
would create a frame dragging effect. In other words,

57
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.870
the cylinder would drag spacetime along with it.

58
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.730
That means that you could hop on a spacecraft and follow the spiral course of

59
00:04:05.731 --> 00:04:09.840
the cylinder. And that would take you back in time.

60
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:16.020
Time would fold upon itself and you'd find yourself in a closed

61
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.340
timelike curve.

62
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.710
It's a loop in which you're traveling into the past has always been a part of

63
00:04:22.711 --> 00:04:26.520
that past. So you wouldn't create any time paradoxes.

64
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.500
If you changed the direction of your travel, you'd go back to the future.

65
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.420
Or rather back to the time you started your journey from the tickler cylinder

66
00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:40.980
specialty is travel into the past, not the future, but Hey,

67
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.680
you could hang out with your favorite people from the past,

68
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.350
go see a real life Jurassic world.

69
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.630
You could even go back to the time when the earth didn't have any life at all.

70
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.480
But of course there is a drawback. All that would only be possible.

71
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.600
If the tickler cylinder had an infinite length,

72
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.820
it would have to go on forever, but that's just impossible.

73
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.090
You can't build something that has no end at all.

74
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.750
If you tried to make a finite cylinder,

75
00:05:12.751 --> 00:05:17.130
then you'd have to deal with some exotic matter and it's negative energy,

76
00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.220
but we haven't discovered it yet.

77
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.880
And it doesn't look like we'll be getting our hands on this kind of matter.

78
00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.163
Anytime soon,

79
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.520
I haven't even mentioned the effects of the black hole on your body.

80
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.900
You'd instantly get sucked into the cylinders black hole if you got close

81
00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:34.734
enough,

82
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.910
but hopefully there are other ways that would allow you to travel through time.

83
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.590
And when you do,

84
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.750
we'll be there for you and help you survive this kind of trip on our new show,

85
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.340
how to survive.
