1
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.170
<v 1>All right. I think it's time for a change up.</v>

2
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.790
Let's do a little spring cleaning and redecorate our solar system.

3
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.520
Now I know you're a big fan of the moon,

4
00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:24.500
but it's so last season let's get something fresh,

5
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.010
something snazzier help out Europa

6
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.980
that I love. I apt the loop glee luck.

7
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.130
I know, I know the moon is a classic,

8
00:00:37.131 --> 00:00:41.900
but Europa could be a heck of an upgrade. Oh.

9
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.790
And before you ask the trade was mutual, the moon is just fine.

10
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.960
So we'll just moon swap with Jupiter. What's the worst that can happen.

11
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.670
What secrets does Europa have in store for us?

12
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.560
Would Europa be the perfect addition to our night sky?

13
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.130
Or did we mess up really badly?

14
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.980
This is what if,

15
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.000
and here's what would happen if you Roper was Earth's moon.

16
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.680
Europa is one of Jupiter's 79 moons.

17
00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:23.660
So I don't think they'll mind if we borrow it covered by a thick layer of

18
00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:26.540
ice with water beneath its surface.

19
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.830
Europa is the sixth largest moon in our solar system

20
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.470
because of its icy surface.

21
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.030
Europa reflects a lot of sunlight making it very,

22
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.830
very bright about five and a half times brighter than our moon to be

23
00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:46.070
exact. And to sweeten the deal.

24
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.120
Europa has three essentials for supporting life,

25
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.860
namely water, chemistry, and energy.

26
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.980
Europa's water dissolves nutrients. So they can be eaten by organisms.

27
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.290
This means that our new moon can be used to transport chemicals

28
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.960
within living cells. Plus,

29
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.260
if we moved Europa to our current moon spot,

30
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.500
it would then be millions of kilometers closer to the sun.

31
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.720
Sunlight might just be the one missing ingredient that's been impeding any life

32
00:02:20.721 --> 00:02:24.890
there from developing further. So if we relocate Europa,

33
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.800
we may eventually have some new neighbors.

34
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.480
So are you sold yet? You're not. Well,

35
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.060
I've already filled out the real estate paperwork.

36
00:02:38.061 --> 00:02:40.490
So we're just going to go ahead and do the swap.

37
00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.250
So imagine looking up at the night sky and seeing, well,

38
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.140
everything Europa would light up the night sky and

39
00:02:51.141 --> 00:02:54.860
be a breathtaking site to make things even better.

40
00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.280
There would be no negative consequences at all. The copy. Look,

41
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:02.890
I'm really not good with this whole real estate thing.

42
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:04.420
So I'm going to come clean with you.

43
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.900
The first inconvenience you're going to have is.

44
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.660
<v 2>Trouble sleeping. Imagine.</v>

45
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.880
<v 1>A floodlight coming through your bedroom window.</v>

46
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.220
Maybe you could just get some new blinds and it won't just be

47
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:22.780
you. Who's having a hard time adjusting. It's going to affect wildlife as well.

48
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.333
For example,

49
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.320
a lot of rodents hide when the Moonlight is strong to avoid becoming dinner for

50
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:33.520
predators, but with a strong continuous Moonlight,

51
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.270
they'll eventually be forced to go outside and into danger.

52
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.880
This means the rodent population will decrease rapidly and

53
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:45.970
that would affect the entire animal feed chain.

54
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.730
Next Europa will shake things up, but not in a good way.

55
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.010
The mass of our moon is one and a half times greater than that, of Europa.

56
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.200
This means that Europa would have a much weaker gravitational effect on the

57
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:06.610
earth. The tides of our oceans will become much smaller.

58
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.170
They may stop removing pollutants and circulating nutrients,

59
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.120
no stuff that the ocean plants and animals need to survive.

60
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.130
If the tides are out of whack,

61
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.900
it could have a devastating effect on ecosystems and lead to mass

62
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:26.980
extinctions. Okay, well, it can't get any worse.

63
00:04:26.981 --> 00:04:29.020
Can it look, don't be mad,

64
00:04:29.021 --> 00:04:31.990
but we may have messed up our entire planet,

65
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.100
but just look at how pretty the moon is. See? Yeah,

66
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.380
just take it in and you're not buying it. Are you.

67
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.330
Our moon is responsible for stabilizing the Earth's axis

68
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.880
without the moon's pool.

69
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.010
This new gravitational shift will start affecting our planet seasons

70
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.993
and climate.

71
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.670
We could be looking at a future where parts of earth hardly ever see the

72
00:04:57.671 --> 00:05:00.820
sun and others never get a break from the sun.

73
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.290
This would affect everything. And I mean everything.

74
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.620
If our access became tilted too much,

75
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.020
we could be looking at another ice age.

76
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.860
Thankfully this process would be slow.

77
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.200
So there would be time to prepare.

78
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.720
The problem is we're not sure we have what it takes. I mean,

79
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.160
look at global warming,

80
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.170
just a few degrees difference can cause entire ecosystems to become

81
00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:30.910
disturbed or wiped out.

82
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.510
And we've barely scratched the surface of solving that problem.

83
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.380
<v 2>Maybe we should give our real moon a call and see if it'll take us back.</v>

84
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.140
We were just so excited about something new and sexy that we took our moon for

85
00:05:46.141 --> 00:05:49.440
granted. I miss you moon.

86
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.050
The good news is there are no real world plans to move our moon

87
00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.560
swapping our moon Europa could lead to some beautiful scenery,

88
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:04.460
but at the cost of catastrophic consequences for earth.

89
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.080
So in the meantime, we're going to work things out with our moon.

90
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.090
<v 3>And what, where did it go? Oh, this is bad.</v>

91
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.550
This is really, really bad.

92
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.650
Imagine that out of nowhere, our moon exploded.

93
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.990
Well, that's a story for another. What if.
