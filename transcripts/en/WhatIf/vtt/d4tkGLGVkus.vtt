00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.130
<v 0>Imagine if earth suddenly lost an entire continent</v>

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.890
north America, wouldn't just vanish off the face of the planet. Of course,

3
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.730
instead it would sink into the oceans.

4
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.290
What could cause this chain of unfortunate events?

5
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.580
How long would it take for the continent to go down?

6
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.690
And how would this change the rest of the world?

7
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.450
This is what if,

8
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.580
and here's what would happen if north America sank into the oceans

9
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.720
1 billion years ago,

10
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.130
the continents meshed together into one super continent called

11
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.090
Rodinia,

12
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.640
but don't mistake it for Pangea that came long after,

13
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.970
during the era of Rodinia the continental crust that forms the

14
00:00:56.971 --> 00:01:01.140
continence was added stickiest. From that point on,

15
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.180
it began to slowly erode and sink at

16
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.870
this rate of erosion. Some 2 billion years from now,

17
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.470
the continence will be fully submerged. Once again,

18
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.960
I'm not ready to wait that long. So what do you say?

19
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.540
We speed things up for north America a little.

20
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.770
Okay. How exactly would this work? Well,

21
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.630
remember what I just said about Rodinia and continental crust thickness that's

22
00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:38.580
right. The continents are shrinking and thinking in our scenario,

23
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.610
it would just happen much faster to north America.

24
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.400
The half billion people that live in north America would lose their homes.

25
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.610
They have to move out to another continent,

26
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.930
but since events were unfolding so fast,

27
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.950
the airlines would be unable to cope with so many passengers.

28
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.480
A lot of people would be left behind and go down with the continent.

29
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.000
And those who were lucky enough to flee would cause a refugee crisis

30
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.863
worldwide.

31
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.290
<v 1>But that would just be the beginning.</v>

32
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.550
<v 2>You might know that continents don't just float in the ocean.</v>

33
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.770
They sit on the layer of solid rock known as the upper mantle,

34
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.880
this upper mantle and the Earth's outer. Most layer,

35
00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:33.530
the crust are broken into tectonic plates and

36
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.590
north America just happens to sit on one of them.

37
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.860
If the continent was to submerge,

38
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.360
it would have to do with the north American tectonic plate going down.

39
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.870
And this is where the bad news would start.

40
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.870
<v 0>The sinking of one tectonic plate would shift other plates around.</v>

41
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.500
This would trigger anything from tsunamis and earthquakes to volcanic

42
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:00.334
eruptions.

43
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.720
They might be massive enough to wipe out humanity altogether.

44
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.950
At the same time, the sea level would rise significantly.

45
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.220
This would flood other areas of the world,

46
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.600
displacing even more people and destroying more communities.

47
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.450
And it wouldn't help that parts of north America are covered with ice.

48
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.940
All that ice would float and then melt adding to the effects of climate change.

49
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.060
If you were still alive, you'd have to invest in some powerful air conditioning,

50
00:03:36.061 --> 00:03:39.630
because it would get very hot, very quickly.

51
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.630
[inaudible].

52
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.080
<v 1>Countless.</v>

53
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.460
<v 0>Volcanoes and other natural disasters unleashed by north America's</v>

54
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.750
bold move would make it tough to continue farming.

55
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.420
So I hope you like cancer,

56
00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.510
and maybe you might want to go live underground until the earth

57
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.500
cooled off a bit.

58
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.820
But that's a story for another.

59
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.343
<v 1>What if</v>

60
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.120
[inaudible].
