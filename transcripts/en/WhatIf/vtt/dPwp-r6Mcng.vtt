00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.480
<v 0>This man is about to dive 20 meters off the top of a cruise ship.</v>

2
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.760
What will happen to his body when he hits the water? Well,

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.890
luckily for him and others, the impact of hitting the water,

4
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.190
wouldn't be the worst part of going overboard.

5
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.270
The worst part would be what would come next,

6
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.000
being lost at sea. Even if you're wearing a life jacket,

7
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.710
surviving all alone in a giant body of water, until someone rescues,

8
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:39.750
you will not be easy.

9
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.040
What would be the biggest threat to your survival?

10
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.670
How could fish eyes save your life?

11
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.700
And how long would you have before the water starts breaking down your

12
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:56.970
skin? This is what if,

13
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.060
and here's what would happen if you spent 24 hours lost at sea,

14
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.190
we say 24 hours because it's a nice, familiar number.

15
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.210
But the reality is that you'll be lucky if you even last,

16
00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:19.440
that long hypothermia can set in within minutes and

17
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.620
dehydration and exhaustion would soon follow.

18
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.260
One crucial thing to keep in mind is that you'd be surrounded by salt

19
00:01:28.261 --> 00:01:30.810
water. You can't drink it,

20
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.540
but it could save you from drowning.

21
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.960
It's a lot easier to drown in fresh water than it is to drown in saltwater.

22
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.490
About 90% of all drownings occur in fresh water.

23
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.540
Not only is saltwater more buoyant than fresh water,

24
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:54.750
but it's also safer to inhale.

25
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.600
If you're going to drown in salt water,

26
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.390
it's because the water you inhaled into your lungs,

27
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.290
stop you from getting oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide.

28
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.430
But with fresh water, it can be a little more complicated.

29
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.780
Fresh water can kill you. Even after it's been removed from your lungs.

30
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.270
When you inhale saltwater,

31
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.950
the higher salt concentration prevents the water from crossing into your lung

32
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:22.860
tissue. When you inhale fresh water,

33
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.750
it can enter unprotected lung cells and make them swell until they

34
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:28.584
burst.

35
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.660
This can lead to such severe damage that you might not recover even

36
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.000
after the water is removed from your lungs,

37
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.540
but saltwater has its drawbacks too.

38
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.810
If you only have saltwater around you,

39
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.690
dehydration can be a major threat.

40
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.730
If the hot sun is beating down on you,

41
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.790
dehydration can begin in about an hour.

42
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.510
You'll be losing water from sweating, urinating,

43
00:02:57.511 --> 00:03:02.200
and even breathing as dehydration sets in.

44
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.060
You'll start to feel extremely thirsty, dizzy, confused,

45
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:11.020
and fatigued. None of that will raise your chances of survival.

46
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.770
We're lucky it will.

47
00:03:13.771 --> 00:03:18.060
Rain rainfall will provide a good source of drinkable water.

48
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.600
Just lay on your back and open your mouth.

49
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.270
But if you don't get any rain, you'll need to be a little more creative.

50
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.410
Try to catch a large fish. If you're successful,

51
00:03:31.411 --> 00:03:33.660
then you have to do is eat its eyes.

52
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.110
Big fish eyes are full of watery liquid. That will surely quench your thirst.

53
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.360
Yeah, I know it's gross,

54
00:03:42.361 --> 00:03:47.100
but there's no time to think about that because you still have to worry about

55
00:03:47.101 --> 00:03:47.934
hypothermia.

56
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.290
Generally you can expect to survive in five degree water for 10 to

57
00:03:58.291 --> 00:04:02.790
20 minutes before your muscles will get weak and you lose your strength and

58
00:04:02.791 --> 00:04:03.630
coordination.

59
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.390
This happens because the blood moves away from the furthest parts of your body

60
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.800
and towards the core,

61
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.140
the best way to prevent hypothermia is to pull your knees up to your chest

62
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.470
and keep them there so that you can retain as much heat as possible.

63
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.300
The less you move around is also better for conserving your energy

64
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.000
and not attracting predators.

65
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.120
As you've probably gathered from the past few minutes,

66
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.990
finding yourself in this scenario would be very bad.

67
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.750
Your best bet at surviving in the sea is to avoid getting into this situation in

68
00:04:39.751 --> 00:04:40.620
the first place. Yes,

69
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.220
if you're going out on a fishing trip or boat,

70
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.780
remember to tell people where you're planning on going and when you're supposed

71
00:04:51.781 --> 00:04:56.730
to be back, technology is making it easier to find people who get lost in water,

72
00:04:56.731 --> 00:05:00.630
but the more information, the better when it comes to rescue missions,

73
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.270
you'd want to be rescued from the water as soon as possible because being

74
00:05:06.271 --> 00:05:10.890
submerged in water for any longer than 24 hours can lead to your

75
00:05:10.891 --> 00:05:13.860
skin, breaking down. If this happens,

76
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.080
you'll have open sores and you would have a greater risk of fungal and bacterial

77
00:05:19.081 --> 00:05:23.640
infections. Even if the water is completely stair out, don't believe me.

78
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.350
Well, maybe you should test it out by sitting in a full bathtub for a few days.

79
00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.880
Great. But that's a story for another

80
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.300
[inaudible].
