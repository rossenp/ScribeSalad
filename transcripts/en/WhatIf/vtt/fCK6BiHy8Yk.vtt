00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.440
<v 1>Seawater is salty,</v>

2
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.440
honey Grinker and a potential source of planets saving

3
00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:16.274
fuel.

4
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.600
<v 0>Hold up fuel. Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.673
<v 1>That's right.</v>

6
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.390
We have the technology to convert seawater into liquid fuel.

7
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.270
Could your car use it?

8
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.510
Would it be carbon neutral and how would

9
00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:37.100
it affect your vacation.

10
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.760
<v 0>Plants? This is what F.</v>

11
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.410
<v 1>And here's what would happen if we powered the planet with seawater,</v>

12
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.870
you're up in the air, staring down at the beautiful ocean below.

13
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.940
It's your first carbon neutral flight, and you couldn't be more excited.

14
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.820
Sure. The tickets were a little more expensive,

15
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.500
but jet setting without the environmental cost of carbon emission

16
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.820
is well worth it.

17
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.210
You think about how amazing it is that the very ocean below you is the

18
00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:14.270
same thing powering this large commercial jet.

19
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.420
But how did we get here

20
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.350
in 2014,

21
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.300
the United States Navy successfully created liquid hydrocarbon

22
00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:27.830
fuel from seawater.

23
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.130
They did this by extracting carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas from

24
00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:38.810
seawater and using a relatively cheap catalyst to convert

25
00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:41.750
carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide.

26
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.960
And just in case I lost you there,

27
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.000
a catalyst is a chemical that lowers the amount of energy needed for

28
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.980
another chemical reaction to happen.

29
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.120
After this chemical reaction is complete.

30
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.080
The carbon monoxide is transformed into fuel.

31
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.050
The U S Navy was able to generate four liters a day in the pilot program,

32
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.780
scaled up this seawater technology could completely replace fossil

33
00:02:11.781 --> 00:02:14.420
fuels, which would be a big deal

34
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.670
in 2017, the U S military,

35
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.470
but 269,230 barrels of oil

36
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.550
every day,

37
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.250
burning all this fuel emitted over 25,000 Kyla tons of carbon

38
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:34.190
dioxide. Not only that,

39
00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:37.460
but because this seawater fuel is liquid,

40
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.700
it could be used in existing cars and airplanes.

41
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.880
And with transportation being responsible for 14% of all greenhouse gas

42
00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:51.710
emissions developing this alternative fuel source would help us eliminate

43
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.260
almost 100 billion metric,

44
00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:58.190
tons of carbon dioxide from our atmosphere by the year 2050,

45
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.770
the immediate cost would be more expensive than oil,

46
00:03:02.771 --> 00:03:07.750
but if we don't cut our greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030,

47
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.500
severe storms, droughts, and famine await,

48
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.020
and it's probably much better to spend a little more upfront to

49
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:17.854
avoid such a mess.

50
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.690
There are three big advantages to this alternative fuel source. First,

51
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.350
the resource is abundant since 70%.

52
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.420
One of our planet is covered by ocean.

53
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.400
We already have a lot of seawater ready to go. Second,

54
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.030
most modern day objects already use liquid fuels.

55
00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:41.400
So it would be an easy conversion.

56
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.340
And third liquid fuels are easier to transport compared to gas.

57
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.580
If you put this new seawater fuel into your current car,

58
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.450
you wouldn't notice any difference. It would look and smell the same.

59
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.520
You would still be emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere when you drove

60
00:04:02.521 --> 00:04:02.971
around,

61
00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:07.800
but because you're only emitting the exact amount of carbon dioxide that

62
00:04:07.801 --> 00:04:12.630
was extracted from the seawater. Initially it's a carbon neutral fuel source.

63
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.530
Of course it would only be truly carbon neutral.

64
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.150
If the whole process was also carbon neutral from

65
00:04:21.151 --> 00:04:25.980
building the liquid storage tanks to pumping water and creating the catalyst,

66
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.340
it would all have to release zero carbon dioxide,

67
00:04:29.341 --> 00:04:33.720
which means we would still need to supplement the process with wind or solar

68
00:04:33.721 --> 00:04:34.554
energy.

69
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.870
You see this method of creating liquid fuel is still early in the developmental

70
00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:42.300
process, even.

71
00:04:42.301 --> 00:04:46.980
So it's important to support new technology being created to replace our current

72
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.110
harmful fossil fuel consumption,

73
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.150
raise your voice and encourage a cleaner and greener future.

74
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.160
We need to push our governments to move forward responsibly and invest in

75
00:04:59.161 --> 00:05:02.370
technology and practices that could save our planet.

76
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.730
Maybe we could raise money for green tech by charging corporations for any

77
00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:11.040
pollution. They inflict on our environment,

78
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:16.740
but that's a story for another. What if.
