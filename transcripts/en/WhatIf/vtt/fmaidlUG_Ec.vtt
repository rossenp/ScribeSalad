00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.290
<v 0>This star is about to transform into a black hole</v>

2
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.630
and we're about to travel inside it to see what's on the other side.

3
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.830
The only problem is that we'll never be able to report our findings

4
00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:26.690
back to earth because once you go inside a black hole,

5
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.880
there's no coming back.

6
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.150
So maybe there's a better way to find out what's on the other side,

7
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.150
could we use a special telescope?

8
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.890
How would light behave inside a black hole?

9
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.010
And why could the first image of a black hole provide

10
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.270
all the answers? This is what if,

11
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.590
and here's what would happen. If we could see through a black hole,

12
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.210
Everything that we can see,

13
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.380
and the world around us is based on light entering our eyes.

14
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.310
If an object doesn't emit or reflect light,

15
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.410
then our eyes can't see it.

16
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.530
So how are we supposed to see through to the other side of a black hole?

17
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.190
It's like the darkest thing we've ever discovered.

18
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.390
Not only does it not emit its own light,

19
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.810
it also sucks up any light that comes near it.

20
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.460
But according to planetary scientist, Joshua Colwell,

21
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.410
seeing through a black hole is not impossible. In fact,

22
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.880
we've already done it.

23
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.260
And all it took was a little bending of space and time.

24
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.220
Let's take a look at the first real image of a black hole.

25
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.200
Even in this low quality picture, you can see through to the other side.

26
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.170
If you look close enough, let's enhance.

27
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.880
If you want to see what's going on on the other side of a black hole,

28
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.860
the most crucial place to look is at this thin ring at its center.

29
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.650
This is called the photon orbit.

30
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.840
It's a ring made up of light particles called photons that have orbited the

31
00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:19.610
black hole two, three,

32
00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:24.500
or even more times before escaping photons can

33
00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:29.390
come closer to the black holes and ordinary matter because they're massless.

34
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.250
And the crazy thing is that the photons we see in this ring,

35
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.340
don't just come from the sides of the black hole.

36
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.770
They also come from behind it.

37
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.470
This is because the black hole can warp space and time to such a degree that

38
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.220
some of the light orbits the black hole in a full circle.

39
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.163
Let me explain,

40
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.690
imagine a star in space that from our perspective is

41
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.340
obscured by a black hole.

42
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.050
The star sends out light in all directions.

43
00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.350
Some of this light would usually reach our eyes on earth and some would just

44
00:03:07.351 --> 00:03:10.860
disappear in other directions. But in this case,

45
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.780
the light that's headed straight for us would get sucked in by the black hole

46
00:03:15.781 --> 00:03:17.430
and disappear forever.

47
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.230
And some of the light that normally wouldn't have reached us will get

48
00:03:22.231 --> 00:03:23.880
redirected by the black hole.

49
00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.490
This light would become part of the photon orbit and eventually make its way to

50
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.660
our eyes on earth.

51
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.370
The light appears to come from the gaseous rim around the black hole,

52
00:03:35.371 --> 00:03:39.600
but it's coming from behind it now. Yeah,

53
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.300
I know this isn't exactly what you were hoping for.

54
00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:44.910
When you imagine seeing through a black hole,

55
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.850
you want to know what it looks like inside, right?

56
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.680
Well, to do that, we would need to travel past the event horizon,

57
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.710
which is essentially the edge of a black hole.

58
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.990
It's the point from which nothing can escape, not matter or light.

59
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.580
So yeah, we won't be able to report our findings back to earth,

60
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.400
but maybe we just want to see it for ourselves. Anyway,

61
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.730
after we pass the event, horizon,

62
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.610
we'll arrive at something called a singularity.

63
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.370
It can be described as a point in space where mass has infinite

64
00:04:23.371 --> 00:04:27.780
density. Everything that goes into a black hole will end up here,

65
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.060
including all the light it's sucked up because you'll be inside the black hole

66
00:04:33.061 --> 00:04:35.340
with the light. You will be able to see it,

67
00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:37.860
but its direction will be all mixed up.

68
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.790
You would probably just see a uniform glow.

69
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.480
If you looked away from the singularity and darkness,

70
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.220
if you look towards it and in true, what if fashion? Yeah,

71
00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.380
that would be the last thing you'd ever.

72
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.750
<v 1>See. So if.</v>

73
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.550
<v 0>You don't want to make that sacrifice,</v>

74
00:04:56.551 --> 00:05:00.270
but you still want to learn more about the inside of a black hole,

75
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.960
then check out this week's. What if disgust podcast,

76
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.300
we'll be talking to professor Clifford Johnson about transparent black holes

77
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.400
and new age telescopes that will allow us to see further into space

78
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:15.540
than ever before.

79
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.260
