00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.180
<v 0>[Inaudible] have you ever wondered what.</v>

2
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.450
<v 1>Dinosaurs were afraid of?</v>

3
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.390
What creature in the Cretaceous period made taking a drink of

4
00:00:17.391 --> 00:00:19.700
water? A dangerous gamble.

5
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.370
I'm talking about terror Crocs. No, no, no,

6
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.070
not those Crocs dinos.

7
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.020
Sukus otherwise known as the terror crocodile.

8
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.690
What made terror? Crocs such extreme predators.

9
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.970
If they were still around, why would threaten their survival today?

10
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.670
And were they able to eat dinosaurs bones at all?

11
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.670
This is what if,

12
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.290
and here's what would happen if terror Crocs were still alive.

13
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.890
<v 0>[Inaudible].</v>

14
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.100
<v 1>About 80 to 73 million years ago.</v>

15
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.990
Dyno sukus ruled over the marshes and swamps and feasted

16
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.670
on unsuspecting dinosaurs. Fossils have been found,

17
00:01:13.671 --> 00:01:18.590
showing that terror Crocs grew up to 10 meters long and

18
00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:21.380
they likely weighed close to five tons.

19
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.500
Just about the size of a city bus.

20
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.000
They had banana sized teeth and jaws,

21
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.840
powerful enough to crush bones, many terror,

22
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.670
crock fossils have damaged teeth leading paleontologists to believe that

23
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.700
terror Crocs chomped on dinosaur balls,

24
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.400
but scientists aren't exactly sure if Tara Crocs were hunters

25
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.530
or scavengers. So if they happen to roam around today,

26
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.480
would they hunt us?

27
00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.850
This might surprise you,

28
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.440
but crocodile attacks are actually more common than shark

29
00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:06.620
attacks and they happen around the world.

30
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.320
For many people, the risk of being attacked by a crocodile is a daily concern.

31
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.963
In fact,

32
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.350
thousands of years of crocodile attacks have contributed to our

33
00:02:18.351 --> 00:02:22.250
evolutionary fear of reptiles known as purpose of phobia.

34
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.830
Like our fear of spiders. We've developed this phobia over time.

35
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.780
It's a natural way that we protect ourselves like modern crocodiles.

36
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.380
The dyno sukus was more of an opportunistic predator.

37
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.740
If anything happened to come into its territory,

38
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.760
these giant crux would gobble it up. No questions asked

39
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.240
most crocodiles eat on average 50 meals a year as

40
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.200
ecto therms,

41
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.520
they gather heat from their environment so they don't need to eat as much as

42
00:02:55.521 --> 00:02:56.930
some animals to stay warm.

43
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.410
The Nile can eat up to half its body weight in one meal.

44
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.460
If the terror crock ate this much,

45
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.600
it could eat about 2000 kilograms in a day.

46
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.370
That's about 36 average sized humans for breakfast

47
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.430
Crocodiles have a unique valve in their heart.

48
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.660
It increases blood flow to their stomachs through a special aorta.

49
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.120
This allows them to secrete gastric acid 10 times faster than most

50
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:35.890
animals. This means that they can dissolve entire animals, bones,

51
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.990
and all as terrifying as it would be to see one of these giants walking down the

52
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:41.824
street,

53
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.060
it's more likely that they would stick to their natural habitat of marshes,

54
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.440
rivers, and swamps.

55
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.970
So you would need to be extra careful about what do they go fishing.

56
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.100
Even though Tara Crocs could wreak havoc on our marshland habitats,

57
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.810
we still hunt them for their skins and make luxury accessories like

58
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:03.730
handbags shoes and belts.

59
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.100
Many crocodiles in Africa and parts of Asia are also killed for their

60
00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:11.140
meat. Unfortunately,

61
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.160
the bigger an animal is the more attractive it is to trophy hunters.

62
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.310
But with conservation efforts around the world,

63
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.390
many endangered species of crocodile have managed to survive.

64
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.470
Now, if you think terror, Crocs are scary,

65
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.420
how would your life change if the Megalodon still roamed our oceans?

66
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.240
Well, that's a story for another. What if.
