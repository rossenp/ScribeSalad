00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.220
<v 0>It's been 30 days since Uranus first appeared in the sky.</v>

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.320
At first,

3
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:11.850
it looked like our moon had found itself a stellar partner,

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.050
but then we understood something.

5
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.670
<v 1>Thing much, much bigger was.</v>

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.953
<v 2>Edit our way.</v>

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.350
<v 1>Caused Uranus to become so unstable.</v>

8
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.430
How could this Epic collision change the ice giant? Oh,

9
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.600
and what's this terrific sting.

10
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.650
<v 2>This.</v>

11
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.630
<v 1>Is what if, and here's what would happen if Uranus collided with.</v>

12
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.463
<v 2>Earth.</v>

13
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.840
<v 1>Let's roll back 30 days when things were still normal,</v>

14
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.090
Uranus lived a quiet life on the outskirts of our solar system,

15
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.540
about 3 billion kilometers away from us.

16
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.670
And then suddenly it began to move closer.

17
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.190
<v 2>Astronomers.</v>

18
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.210
<v 1>Would be the first to push the panic button by their calculations.</v>

19
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.410
It would take Uranus 13 years to reach the collision point.

20
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.420
We'd be short on time,

21
00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:21.290
but at least we'd have a slight chance to evacuate the earth,

22
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.780
but the cold blue giant had other plans in mind.

23
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.600
This would be no standard planetary drill planets.

24
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.320
Don't just take off from their orbits for no reason at all.

25
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:41.510
But somehow Uranus did.

26
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.450
Now it would be hurdling through the solar system ramping up to a speed of

27
00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:50.030
around 1000 kilometers per second,

28
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.090
because of this unexpectedly fast speed we'd only have about

29
00:01:56.091 --> 00:01:58.160
30 days left on this planet.

30
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.170
Uranus would shine like a bright blue star in the sky.

31
00:02:03.171 --> 00:02:06.830
And every day it would appear bigger and brighter.

32
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.370
Our sky would look gorgeous,

33
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.940
not only because of the ice giant shining down on us,

34
00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:17.090
but also thanks to many shooting stars.

35
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.180
Only those wouldn't be stars at all

36
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.540
to get to the Earth's orbit.

37
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.490
Uranus would have to pass an asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars.

38
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.250
This would disrupt the stable orbits of many asteroids and throw

39
00:02:34.251 --> 00:02:35.390
some of them are away.

40
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.360
These asteroids can be as big as 240 kilometers in

41
00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:42.194
diameter.

42
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.330
That's a few times larger than the one responsible for wiping

43
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.620
dinosaurs off the face of the earth. About 65 million years ago,

44
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.590
we would have nowhere to go.

45
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.640
We'd just be left here watching the end of times,

46
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.160
unfold in front of our eyes might as well enjoy the view

47
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.900
by the time the first to asteroids appeared as shooting stars,

48
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.860
Uranus would look about the same size as the moon,

49
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.790
but it would be growing rapidly as it moved ever closer.

50
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.900
While you'd be here awaiting humanity's doom,

51
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.420
Uranus would start shaking things up because

52
00:03:27.421 --> 00:03:31.500
Uranus is about 15 times more massive than the earth

53
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.420
its gravitational pole would start massively affecting our planet.

54
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.180
Volcanoes would begin erupting uncontrollably and tremendous

55
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.590
earthquakes would get in on the act, destroying the earth from the inside

56
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.010
and the stink you drop unconscious from even

57
00:03:53.011 --> 00:03:56.100
one width of it because, well, I mean,

58
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.230
Uranus smells like farts. The ice giants,

59
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.310
upper atmosphere is mostly composed of hydrogen sulfide.

60
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.820
It's the same stuff that makes rotten eggs rink so bad.

61
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.620
Imagine an entire planet of rotten eggs and golfing the earth.

62
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.820
The thought of it makes me nauseous,

63
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.100
but Uranus wouldn't come alone.

64
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.230
It would bring all of its 27 moons along for the ride.

65
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.790
And those moons would be hitting the earth from all sides.

66
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.630
As a fun-filled filled finale,

67
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.670
Uranus would compress what was left of our atmosphere and the

68
00:04:41.671 --> 00:04:44.760
rapidly rising temperatures would ignite it,

69
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.220
just like that.

70
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.410
Our beautiful blue planet would fall in line and start circling the

71
00:04:52.411 --> 00:04:56.790
ice giant eventually becoming one of its many

72
00:04:56.791 --> 00:05:01.770
moons Uranus wouldn't get away with this assault

73
00:05:01.771 --> 00:05:03.000
so easily. However,

74
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.430
last time it collided with another planetary object twice the size of earth it

75
00:05:08.431 --> 00:05:10.200
tipped over. Yeah,

76
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.850
Uranus is the only planet in our neighborhood. That's spins on it.

77
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:15.743
<v 2>Side.</v>

78
00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.890
<v 1>This impact featuring our earthly home could help tilt it back to</v>

79
00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:23.790
how it once was,

80
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.910
but where the earth we know that would be it if by

81
00:05:29.911 --> 00:05:34.500
some unexplained mystery life on earth, stinking,

82
00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:36.270
leftovers emerged. Once again,

83
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.260
we would see the blue of Uranus on the horizon.

84
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.510
It would look just as cool as if the earth was one of Jupiter's moons,

85
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.790
but that's a story for another, what is.
