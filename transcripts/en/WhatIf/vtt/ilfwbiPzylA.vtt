00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.530
<v 0>[Inaudible] there are 1500 active volcanoes on earth.</v>

2
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.750
Just one of those volcanoes could do catastrophic damage,

3
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.120
but at midnight, tonight,

4
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.050
every volcano on the planet is erupted.

5
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.700
You might want to cancel any plans.

6
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.120
How much damage are we talking about here?

7
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.380
What would life be like for the survivors?

8
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.270
And what do you mean? It gets even worse than lava.

9
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.390
This is what if,

10
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.340
and here's what would happen if a bulk panic apocalypse happened tomorrow,

11
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.613
brace yourself.

12
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.090
This may just be the worst weather forecast you're ever going to hear

13
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.550
every volcano on earth,

14
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.290
active or dormant on land or under the sea is

15
00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:05.930
ready to blow the lid off this place.

16
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.580
You can expect to see plumes of Ash, lava, bombs,

17
00:01:10.581 --> 00:01:15.230
and jet spurts on every single continent and in every single

18
00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:18.020
ocean. But I know what you're thinking.

19
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.280
You can take the heat right now. Take a seat there. Sparky.

20
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.680
It's going to get a whole lot worse.

21
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.270
If every volcano on earth erupted at once,

22
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.960
it would set off some high magnitude earthquakes.

23
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.660
This is because so many volcanoes are located near the shifting tectonic plates

24
00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:39.494
of the earth.

25
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.480
And while the lava and earthquakes would certainly do some major damage,

26
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.610
one of the biggest blows we're going to face is the nasty gases that

27
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.990
you out of volcanoes clouds of gas smoke,

28
00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:58.910
and Ash can travel in almost liquid like motions to anywhere in

29
00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:02.930
the world. They could smother the earth in a matter of minutes,

30
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.300
but let's say for a second, you managed to survive the initial explosions.

31
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.780
Well, I've got two very upsetting words for you.

32
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.120
Volcanic Ash,

33
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.360
the volcanic Ash would black out the skies blocking any sunlight in the

34
00:02:20.361 --> 00:02:21.194
process.

35
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.330
This would cause the temperature on earth to plumb it without the

36
00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:26.990
sun.

37
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.760
The Earth's surface temperature would plunge to zero degrees after the first

38
00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:34.910
week, and then to minus 66 degrees.

39
00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:38.180
By the end of the first year and the bright side,

40
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:43.070
it's not an Inferno of death anymore to make matters worse.

41
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.740
No sunlight means no plants,

42
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.860
which means no food for animals.

43
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.950
Most animal species would go extinct.

44
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.110
As the loss of plants would set off a mass extinction due to its impact

45
00:02:57.111 --> 00:03:01.330
on the food chain hen don't hold your breath for the stragglers.

46
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.330
You can expect acid rain to take care of them.

47
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.440
This is because of those volcanic gases. We mentioned earlier,

48
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.940
hydrochloric acid, hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen sulfide,

49
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:17.830
and sulfur dioxide would condense in the atmosphere and they would fall to the

50
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:18.970
earth as rain.

51
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.890
This would then contaminate any fresh water supply we had left,

52
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.220
but what if we had some fighters still kicking?

53
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.170
What would life be like for those living in the aftermath? Well,

54
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.110
the economy isn't going to do you any favors,

55
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.910
the volcanic destruction would cause a complete economic collapse.

56
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.510
Every business and bank would shut down.

57
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.130
You lose access to credit and become instantly unemployed.

58
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.690
Unless you count being a wasteland survivor as your new job.

59
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.880
This is Peter Day, one 24,

60
00:04:02.881 --> 00:04:06.510
coming to you live from inside my underground bunker. You know,

61
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.070
since the apocalypse people lost everything, not me.

62
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.780
I had a plan, you know,

63
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.140
even before the economy literally burnt to the ground,

64
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.330
I invested in gold owning gold can act as a hedge against

65
00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:25.320
inflation deflation. And in this case, the apocalypse,

66
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.000
it's literally the gold standard for value and can provide financial well

67
00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:31.980
coverage. In these uncertain times,

68
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.680
you should head on over to the sponsor of this video.

69
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.510

world. Since using JM bullion.com.

75
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.560
Life down here has been golden cause it's gold.

76
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.950
There's not a lot of people down here to talk to.

77
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.310
It would be full blown post Apocalyptica out there searching

78
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:15.030
the Ash covered world for aquifers containing fresh water,

79
00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.130
venturing out into the wasteland for supplies and living in heated

80
00:05:20.131 --> 00:05:22.710
underground bunkers. Now,

81
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.660
while it is very possible that volcanoes could set each other off by

82
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.100
being in close proximity,

83
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.650
the chances of every volcano on earth exploding at once is

84
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.180
highly unlikely,

85
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.970
but it does make us think about how quickly things can go South.

86
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.780
What if we could prepare for something like this?

87
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.300
What if we built the world's deepest bunker? Well,

88
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.560
that's a story for another. What if

89
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.580
[inaudible].
