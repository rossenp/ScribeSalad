1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.890
<v 0>President Donald Trump has tested positive for COVID-19.</v>

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.890
Trump is 74 years old and not dimension overweight,

3
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.620
advanced age and obesity are two factors that put someone at high risk

4
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:18.240
of death from COVID-19.

5
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.210
So what would happen if the president died just

6
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:25.890
before the U S election,

7
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.430
how would this affect the election?

8
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.950
Who would the new presidential candidate be and

9
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.920
how would this new candidate be chosen?

10
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.160
This is what if,

11
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.110
and here's what would happen if the U S president dies before the election?

12
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.050
If something like this did happen, it would be for the first time,

13
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.390
the closest, anything like this has happened before occurred in 1912,

14
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.040
when a vice presidential candidate died just days before the election.

15
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.290
But what if instead of a vice-president passing away,

16
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.120
it was the president just weeks before the election.

17
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.470
Normally, if a president dies while in office,

18
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.920
the vice president would take over. So vice president,

19
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.370
Mike Pence would take over the role of commander in chief,

20
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.150
along with any other presidential duties. Yes,

21
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.550
but that doesn't necessarily mean that Pence would be the Republican party's

22
00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:36.230
presidential nominee in the upcoming election. Although he would be the most,

23
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.430
a likely choice to be the new presidential nominee. It isn't guaranteed.

24
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.710
If the president dies,

25
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.570
the Republican national committee would have to vote again to decide who their

26
00:01:47.571 --> 00:01:52.370
new nominee would be B and sure, let's assume it is going to be pets.

27
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.130
If this had happened six months ago,

28
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.540
the Republican party would have been able to put Pence's name on the ballot.

29
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.060
But since it's so close to the election, there would be no way to change.

30
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.730
What's on the voting ballot. Each state,

31
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.050
it has a deadline to put new candidates on the ballot and those deadlines have

32
00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:12.884
passed.

33
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.560
And there's another small detail early voters have already cast

34
00:02:18.561 --> 00:02:22.610
their ballot. So this is where things could get complicated.

35
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.910
People could still be voting for Trump on the ballot,

36
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.200
but technically it could be for the Republican party's new candidate,

37
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.243
Mike Pence.

38
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.380
And although Joe Biden tested negative shortly after the first

39
00:02:36.381 --> 00:02:40.880
presidential debate, what if he contracted COVID-19 and then died?

40
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.350
Well, it would be largely the same process.

41
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.650
The democratic party would need to nominate a new candidate.

42
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.650
Kamala Harris would be one of the top choices,

43
00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:54.620
but who's to say Bernie Sanders wouldn't get nominated.

44
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.560
This process would once again, be messy, complicated,

45
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.000
and at times,

46
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.800
pretty scary Americans voting for Joe Biden on the ballot might not

47
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:09.610
know exactly who they'd be voting for if something like this happened.

48
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.860
Now,

49
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.600
what if Trump were to win the election on November 3rd and then died shortly

50
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:21.160
thereafter? Well, since this has never happened before,

51
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.370
there's definitely some uncertainty in this scenario.

52
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.870
After November 3rd, when all the votes have been cast,

53
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.330
the electoral college of each state would meet to vote for a new president

54
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.070
based on how many votes each candidate received. If this happened,

55
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.810
most state electors would just vote for the vice presidential nominee for

56
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:44.644
president,

57
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.140
but other States specifically state that electors must

58
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:55.090
vote for the name on the ballot. And in this case, that would be Trump.

59
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.240
This could open the door for months of legal actions and courtroom battles,

60
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.300
but regardless the 20th amendment of the United States constitution States that

61
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.310
if a president elect dies, the vice president elect would become president,

62
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.950
but there's still lots of uncertainty and complications about how this could

63
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:18.784
play out.

64
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.790
And could the president dying or getting sick delay the election?

65
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.900
Well, the president doesn't have the power to do that.

66
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.480
And although Congress could delay it, it's very unlikely. It would happen.

67
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.700
What's most likely to happen. If the president dies this close to the election,

68
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.120
is that Mike Pence would be the new Republican nominee.

69
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.940
And if the Republican party wins,

70
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.620
then Mike Pence would become the president of the United States.

71
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.470
But what if Pence were to get sick and die from morbid?

72
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.360
I know, but it is a question worth asking if that were to happen.

73
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.050
Then the speaker of the house, Nancy Pelosi would become president.

74
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.330
And if she were to die,

75
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.480
it would go to the president pro temporary of the Senate.

76
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.850
And if that person dies,

77
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.450
then it would go down to a list of secretaries of the cabinet.

78
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.800
And hopefully all the dying stops at that point.

79
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.410
But since something like this has never happened before the results

80
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:30.820
could be complicated and we don't know exactly what would happen

81
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.000
2020 throws us another curve ball. Hey,

82
