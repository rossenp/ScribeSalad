1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.320
<v 0>Octopuses have been around.</v>

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.590
And the current is full and far on 200 million years.

3
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.360
And if we are the most neurologically complex

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.940
versus an animal, they are the most neurologically complex in invertebrates.

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.880
So it's a completely different form of intelligence.

6
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:22.860
It couldn't get more different between an octopus and a human and Yext.

7
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.710
Somehow there are things we can relate to in one another.

8
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.120
<v 1>Okay. Peter, let's settle this right out of the gate. I have one octopus.</v>

9
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.380
I have two.

10
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.820
<v 2>No octopuses octopus is, I know we went through this last show, uh,</v>

11
00:00:58.821 --> 00:01:02.990
when we were describing what's coming up on this week's show. Um,

12
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.820
not only is, uh, octopus, correct? I know you're in the octopi camp.

13
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.750
Yes, I am. Not only does. OC is octopus is okay.

14
00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:15.350
It's actually the correct, uh, pluralization of octopus.

15
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.240
<v 1>Not that I don't trust you or believe you, but I felt the need to double check.</v>

16
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.410
So I hit the old magic box. Everyone's double checking me. And, uh,

17
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.920
apparently yes, grammatically speaking,

18
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:32.270
the plural for octopus is octopus's

19
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.050
as the Miriam Webster dictionary points out,

20
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.270
people use three different terms, however, octopi,

21
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.540
octopuses, and octopodes

22
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.450
while octopi has become popular in modern usage. It's.

23
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.320
<v 2>It's a mistake. It is a mistake. The defense rests, your honor.</v>

24
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.910
<v 1>So I'm not going to lie. I don't like it. Uh, you know, when you know,</v>

25
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.190
you've been saying, you've been saying something for years,

26
00:02:01.191 --> 00:02:03.320
and then you got to say it differently. It feels odd,

27
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.130
but for the kids out there, plenty of kids, uh, fans of, of the,

28
00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:11.120
what if videos we want to make sure our grammar is correct. So I will,

29
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.860
I will respect the proper pronunciation and I'm going to go with

30
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.420
octopuses. What else do you know outside of the proper pronunciation about

31
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.310
octopuses?

32
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.730
<v 2>Well, what do I know about them? I, I just learned, uh,</v>

33
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.700
earlier we course we know that they have eight arms.

34
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.880
I used to say eight tentacles, but that's not correct.

35
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.540
An octopus has no tentacles. Octopus has eight arms. Uh,

36
00:02:35.541 --> 00:02:40.220
they shoot ink at predators as they're running away as a defense mechanism. Um,

37
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.760
and after watching the Netflix hit documentary, my octopus teacher,

38
00:02:43.761 --> 00:02:45.380
I know a whole lot more than I ever did.

39
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.040
<v 1>As do I, uh, nocturnal hunters made crabs.</v>

40
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.590
I don't know why I would've assumed they were vegetarian or,

41
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.830
or cause they're soft. Yeah. You just would've thought they eat like,

42
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.380
like that sort of microbial, uh, you know, um,

43
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.200
what do they call that? A krill or something like that? No, they're, they're,

44
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:05.110
they're taking down lobsters and crabs.

45
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:08.710
Like they're straight up carnivores. Uh,

46
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.700
as far as in the art of camouflage, they make like chameleons look like,

47
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.830
like peacocks, like these guy, like they're not just changing colors, you know,

48
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:19.690
they're adding shells to the whole, I mean, it was,

49
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.640
it was wild to see the level to which they also are able to

50
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.800
blend in with the rest of the ocean.

51
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.200
<v 2>Yeah. But in the end,</v>

52
00:03:28.201 --> 00:03:31.530
I think why this movie has resonated with so many people around the world is,

53
00:03:31.531 --> 00:03:35.250
and why octopuses have fascinated people for so long? Uh,

54
00:03:35.251 --> 00:03:39.060
you were talking a while ago about thinking they might be from outer space. Yes.

55
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.430
That's not confirmed. Um, but they are crazy smart. And uh,

56
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.790
dare I say, emotional strategic affectionate.

57
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.910
<v 1>Well, I mean, this is, and just, it also,</v>

58
00:03:50.911 --> 00:03:55.080
hasn't been disproven that they're familiar. They have three hearts, come on.

59
00:03:55.081 --> 00:03:59.520
There's something going on here. But there were stories I,

60
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.330
this kind of got a lot of coverage. I think, I dunno, maybe it was last year,

61
00:04:03.331 --> 00:04:05.860
whatever there was, there was a, uh,

62
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.210
an octopus that escaped from a, an aquarium.

63
00:04:09.211 --> 00:04:13.770
Like literally it wasn't just that it escaped there. Like it was on camera,

64
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.160
you know, you could see it. And I actually, I pulled it up here. It was,

65
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.350
the octopus was called inky. Yeah. Please try harder. Like,

66
00:04:22.351 --> 00:04:25.170
come on, man. Um, the inky,

67
00:04:25.171 --> 00:04:28.260
the octopus escaped from a New Zealand aquarium,

68
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.420
which some called the Shawshank redemption. Oh, not me, others,

69
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.010
others did. Uh, and that, and that, you know, there are no bones.

70
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.001
So they were, you know,

71
00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:42.150
they're able to get through these really incredibly small spaces,

72
00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:45.180
just like in Shauna's. Exactly. Um,

73
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.310
and they could also survive an hour out of water,

74
00:04:47.311 --> 00:04:49.380
which helps that type of escape,

75
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.450
but it was the type of thing that people started to really wake up to hearing a

76
00:04:54.451 --> 00:04:58.440
little more about, wow, octopus are really smart and they're sneaky,

77
00:04:58.441 --> 00:05:02.030
but they can also, then there was videos of them like opening, like they were.

78
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.630
<v 2>In unscrewing screwing caps and it learned the guard schedule. I think</v>

79
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.623
it's just like.

80
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.120
<v 1>Fantastic. Um,</v>

81
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.330
but what we don't know,

82
00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:20.280
I guess outside of this is what if an octopus

83
00:05:20.281 --> 00:05:21.270
was your teacher?

84
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.201
<v 2>Well,</v>

85
00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:27.030
I would say who better to ask them the director of the Netflix movie,

86
00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:29.580
my octopus teacher PIPA early-ish

87
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.520
Pippa early-ish is a natural history filmmaker and award-winning environmental

88
00:05:35.521 --> 00:05:40.290
journalist specializing in the field of Marine science and conservation early.

89
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.860
She is an accomplished diver and has worked with some of the world's top Marine

90
00:05:43.861 --> 00:05:46.110
researchers and underwater photographers.

91
00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.730
And he's the editor of the acclaimed photographic book, sea change,

92
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.590
primal joy, and the art of underwater tracking PIPA. Welcome.

93
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.120
<v 1>To the show. So great to have with us today on what if discussed?</v>

94
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.090
<v 0>Thanks so much for inviting me guys. I'm very excited to be here.</v>

95
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.150
<v 1>So we were talking just sort of in the opening about kind of what this means</v>

96
00:06:07.151 --> 00:06:09.580
that a movie like this has, has,

97
00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.450
has blown up as the kids might've said once, um,

98
00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:16.570
in a way that it has, because, you know, I,

99
00:06:16.571 --> 00:06:18.460
I don't know what your expectations were,

100
00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:22.180
but the fact that this has resonated with so many people,

101
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.490
for the reasons that I think are, are good.

102
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.090
And part of the actual story of this beautiful connection,

103
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.380
it has to feel pretty good.

104
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.020
<v 0>Yeah. It feels, it feels overwhelming, very overwhelming,</v>

105
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.480
um, and shocking in some ways, but deeply,

106
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.250
deeply reassuring, uh, that people are resonating with the story.

107
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.413
Because

108
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.390
I think something that we don't talk about match and something that's really,

109
00:06:52.391 --> 00:06:56.710
really worrying in the world today is we can see that we're

110
00:06:56.711 --> 00:07:01.030
treating our panics in a way that is very, very bad for everyone and very,

111
00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:02.920
very bad for everyone that's going to come after us,

112
00:07:02.921 --> 00:07:06.910
but we never really questioned how we got here. And honestly,

113
00:07:06.911 --> 00:07:11.050
I think our disconnection, our emotional, psychological,

114
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.200
spiritual disconnection from the natural world is one of the greatest threats

115
00:07:14.201 --> 00:07:18.670
that we face and possibly the one that's spoken about the least.

116
00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:22.690
So the fact that people are resonating with this phone, uh,

117
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.600
makes me feel extremely hopeful. Yeah.

118
00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.690
<v 1>I would agree with that. I mean, that's a good way to put it,</v>

119
00:07:28.691 --> 00:07:33.490
actually that disconnect allows you to sort of commodify things and

120
00:07:33.491 --> 00:07:37.510
separate yourself from an and clearly what we see in my octopus teachers

121
00:07:37.511 --> 00:07:41.710
connection that reminder that we're all kind of from the same place for just

122
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.460
process wise, because there's, you know, there's a lot of moving parts here,

123
00:07:45.461 --> 00:07:47.350
obviously, uh,

124
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.620
Craig and his team are we're filmmakers.

125
00:07:50.621 --> 00:07:54.040
This project had been going for a while when you come in at some point.

126
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.100
So give us a little background of kind of where you come into this.

127
00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.490
<v 0>A long time ago, Craig actually gave up for making, uh,</v>

128
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.790
as we say in the full he'd completely burnt himself out.

129
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.590
He wasn't enjoying it anymore. He'd worked too hard for too long. Uh,

130
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:16.870
it wasn't bringing him the meaning that it had previously, I suppose.

131
00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:20.830
So he just put down his camera and never wanted to go into an edit suite again.

132
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.810
Um, and he moved from Cape town,

133
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.860
the city they lived in and he moved down to the coast, uh,

134
00:08:29.861 --> 00:08:31.450
and started going in the cold every day.

135
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.280
And there was only kind of a few years into swimming every day that he picked up

136
00:08:36.281 --> 00:08:38.800
a camera again. Um,

137
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.060
and then a while into that process that he met the octopus. So,

138
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:49.510
uh, he is a filmmaker, but he wasn't setting out to make up for this.

139
00:08:49.511 --> 00:08:51.460
This, this was a spontaneous thing that happened.

140
00:08:51.461 --> 00:08:56.430
He just fell in love with this incredible what ecosystem and

141
00:08:56.431 --> 00:09:01.320
was completely kind of his curiosity just got the better of him in a way

142
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.380
he is so passionate about this place every morning.

143
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.560
He's excited to wake up and see what he can find. Um,

144
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.960
and he is a photographer and he is an ISIS.

145
00:09:09.961 --> 00:09:12.960
So documenting that process came very naturally to him.

146
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:19.470
And it had some points that that kind of feeling came back in him

147
00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:20.520
that he went in to make a phone.

148
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:24.660
And it actually took a lot of time before he realized that it was his

149
00:09:24.661 --> 00:09:29.310
experiences with the octopus, um, that has been very powerful to him. But,

150
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.060
uh,

151
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:36.780
I think he didn't immediately consider while this is a story that we can make

152
00:09:36.781 --> 00:09:38.100
into a film.

153
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:43.050
He was just looking at all sorts of things and more traditional natural history

154
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:46.320
scenarios as well. And

155
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.870
I met him in 2015.

156
00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:56.640
I went for a dive with a friend of mine called rice.

157
00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.770
Who's one of the co-founders of sea change project.

158
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.100
And we were going to die with no way to switch. I was nervous about,

159
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:08.160
and I've been diving in capes on at that point for at least eight years.

160
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.810
So I didn't expect, I didn't expect this to be a groundbreaking experience,

161
00:10:12.811 --> 00:10:17.760
but I can tell you that the minute that we got to that shoreline,

162
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:22.410
I started seeing this environment in a way that I never dreamed was possible

163
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.960
because Craig notices details and patterns

164
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.850
that allow you to get close to the culled forest

165
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:38.400
in a way that is impossible, if you haven't dedicated all the time that he has.

166
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:43.740
Um, yeah. And then I didn't see him for a very long time.

167
00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:49.110
And in 2016 I'd been a science journalist for a long

168
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:53.310
time. And I've been working with Marine biologists all over the world.

169
00:10:53.311 --> 00:10:54.450
And I had an incredible job.

170
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:59.370
I was flying all over the place and photographing sharks and rising about

171
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.040
shark biology. Um,

172
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:06.690
but I became a little bit despondent about the fact that I was missing all of

173
00:11:06.691 --> 00:11:11.550
these incredible people who had stories about nature and about

174
00:11:11.551 --> 00:11:13.830
experiences that they had with nature and deep,

175
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.920
deep understanding of the animals and places that they were working in.

176
00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:22.110
And my experiences felt quite shallow and vicarious.

177
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.090
So that was why I asked Craig if I could start swimming

178
00:11:27.091 --> 00:11:30.720
with him and diving with him. And if he would teach me something about tracking,

179
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.880
um, and it was only six months into that process that he said to me one day,

180
00:11:35.881 --> 00:11:38.130
look, I'm going to make this full. And then would you like to help me.

181
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.060
<v 2>Pippa? It's mentioned in the film that, uh,</v>

182
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:45.680
we know very little about the octopus and as we found out, it's called octopus.

183
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.540
Vulgaris what, uh,

184
00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.560
did you know about the octopus vulgaris before you started this film and then

185
00:11:51.561 --> 00:11:52.790
what did you come out of this?

186
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.780
<v 0>So I went into this phone knowing that an octopus had</v>

187
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:00.790
eight tentacles

188
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.100
and can change color and just Kevin.

189
00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.260
And that was kind of the depth of my understanding.

190
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.880
The very first thing I learned is that octopuses don't have any tentacles at

191
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:15.250
all. They only have arms.

192
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:18.310
So that's a common misconception.

193
00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:21.060
<v 1>And two feet. It seems like we saw two feet.</v>

194
00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.260
<v 0>Yes. Sometimes they make two feet,</v>

195
00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:29.700
but they're actually walking on their arms even then. Uh, yeah.

196
00:12:29.701 --> 00:12:33.390
And I came out of this foam after spending many,

197
00:12:33.391 --> 00:12:36.990
many hours under water with octopuses. Uh,

198
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.450
one of the early things I learned to do was,

199
00:12:39.451 --> 00:12:44.190
was learn how to track them and find where they lived. Um,

200
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.780
we're doing a whole lot of research about them and,

201
00:12:46.781 --> 00:12:51.600
and to understand how octopus has fit into our world from an evolutionary point

202
00:12:51.601 --> 00:12:52.710
of view is very,

203
00:12:52.711 --> 00:12:57.360
very helpful because what you need to realize is somewhere

204
00:12:57.361 --> 00:13:00.120
around four or 500 million years ago,

205
00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.590
we and artifices where a similar kind of worm type thing.

206
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:10.350
And then we broke off into the vertical red line and they broke off into the

207
00:13:10.351 --> 00:13:13.350
invertebrate line. Yeah.

208
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:18.300
So around after this is have been around in its current form

209
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.950
for around 200 million years.

210
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:24.750
And if we are the most neurologically complex

211
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:30.390
vertebrate animal, they are the most neurologically complex in vertebrates.

212
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.300
So it's a completely different form of intelligence.

213
00:13:33.301 --> 00:13:37.950
It couldn't get more difference between an octopus and a human. And yet,

214
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.160
somehow there are things we can relate to in one another.

215
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:46.200
<v 1>Well, which came out obviously beautifully emotionally, but also,</v>

216
00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:49.320
I don't want to say intellectually, that might not be the right word,

217
00:13:49.321 --> 00:13:52.050
but you mentioned clever. And, and to your point, I mean,

218
00:13:52.051 --> 00:13:54.690
I think there is some common, uh,

219
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.710
understanding that there's a higher level of, of let's say intelligence here,

220
00:13:58.711 --> 00:14:01.950
but we literally see, uh, in the,

221
00:14:01.951 --> 00:14:06.870
in the film without giving too much away, especially as it pertained to the,

222
00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:09.210
the, the, the relationship,

223
00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.890
maybe the wrong word here with the predators in the environment,

224
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:19.100
we saw strategy, like we saw adaptations to, uh, Oh,

225
00:14:19.101 --> 00:14:21.450
okay, well that happened this time. I'm going to have to do this.

226
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:25.010
And in a relatively short period of time. Yeah. Like, I mean, it,

227
00:14:25.011 --> 00:14:28.320
it seemed strategic. Is that a fair? Is that the right word?

228
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.730
<v 0>Yeah, they are definitely strategic and they are strategic</v>

229
00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.011
intentionally.

230
00:14:35.011 --> 00:14:37.980
And then they're also strategic from an instinctive point of view.

231
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:43.890
So these octopuses have lived in this cult forest for millions of

232
00:14:43.891 --> 00:14:44.724
years now.

233
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:49.950
So they have developed all kinds of defense mechanisms for dealing with

234
00:14:49.951 --> 00:14:52.820
creditors and, and it's an incredibly creative to danced environment.

235
00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:56.420
There are sharks everywhere. Um,

236
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.640
I think something like 30% of the octopuses we see are missing alum.

237
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:07.580
So they, they're having a hard time surviving that kelp forest. Um,

238
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:12.380
so they've come up with new strategies and it lives somewhere in their kind of

239
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:16.040
species consciousness and emerges when it needs to,

240
00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.270
but individual animals also learning along the way. Um,

241
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:25.040
and you see how the Kesha octopus kind of

242
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.800
develops inability to deal with scavengers that are

243
00:15:30.801 --> 00:15:34.370
coming into a space when she's caught, you know, what the, the,

244
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:38.840
the brittle stars, for example, you saw how at the beginning,

245
00:15:38.841 --> 00:15:42.080
she didn't know how to catch lobsters. She tried and she tried and she tried,

246
00:15:42.081 --> 00:15:46.790
and she almost seemed to get frustrated and eventually she figured it out. Um,

247
00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.780
and one of the most fascinating things for us is,

248
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.080
I don't know if you can see that,

249
00:15:54.081 --> 00:15:57.050
but you see that little tiny hole in the end of that shell.

250
00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:03.650
So this is something that was explained to us by professor Jennifer Mathur,

251
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:08.450
who came out and was the scientific advisor. Um, she's one of the,

252
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.940
world's only octopus psychologists.

253
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:17.630
She spent most of her life trying to get into the mind of cephalopods and

254
00:16:17.631 --> 00:16:19.430
she gives them and a whole lot of these shells.

255
00:16:19.431 --> 00:16:24.260
And what you sometimes find is there'll be two or three holes with animals

256
00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.370
failed before they got in. And what that means is, uh,

257
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:33.200
that they're trying not getting the hallway in or not getting into the right

258
00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:36.080
parts of the animal that they're trying to kill.

259
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:37.460
And then they have to try again.

260
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.090
So they almost have to learn a kind of geometry.

261
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.960
And once they learn how to do it, every single time they go back,

262
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.450
they tend to get it right. And like they said,

263
00:16:47.451 --> 00:16:50.000
there's a drill on the end of one of their arms. Is that how you put it?

264
00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.500
It's not on there. It's not on the end of their arm. It's like inside the beach.

265
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.070
And it is a drill and sane.

266
00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:03.460
<v 1>Army knife in there. I mean, uh, but it was just, I mean, it was good.</v>

267
00:17:03.461 --> 00:17:06.520
And again, I mean, that's a big part of the movie, right.

268
00:17:06.521 --> 00:17:10.810
We learn a lot of different things. Uh, but also, uh,

269
00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:15.370
the lifespan, I didn't know. I, and I don't think it's a spoiler. I mean,

270
00:17:15.371 --> 00:17:17.830
I think it's going to obviously come up, but why,

271
00:17:17.831 --> 00:17:22.300
what is the lifespan of an octopus and why was that

272
00:17:22.301 --> 00:17:25.150
important in, in sort of the narrative of this film?

273
00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:30.730
<v 0>So different species have different lifespans, um,</v>

274
00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.530
the giant Pacific octopus,

275
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:37.450
which lives kind of on the coast of Canada and California lives for up to three

276
00:17:37.451 --> 00:17:41.080
years, but our little octopus,

277
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.050
vulgarness coming up to the slips for around 18 months.

278
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.150
And it's very important. It's quite extraordinary, really.

279
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:54.000
You realize how quickly they have to learn and how much they learn in a very,

280
00:17:54.001 --> 00:17:56.340
very short space of time. Um,

281
00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:59.520
and obviously Craig,

282
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.920
you that his time with his animal was limited. Um,

283
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.720
I don't know how much he was thinking about that during the time that he was

284
00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:11.340
with her. Um,

285
00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.820
but a lot of the stories is bittersweet because you kind of get the sense that

286
00:18:17.821 --> 00:18:19.770
the end is coming. Um,

287
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:25.740
and also in terms of a evolutionary strategy,

288
00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.080
the short life span is really,

289
00:18:28.081 --> 00:18:32.160
really interesting because their whole breeding cycle revolves around that. Um,

290
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:38.670
octopuses, when they, once they made, uh,

291
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.740
the males kind of die and the females climb inside the

292
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:48.600
den and lay eggs and they stay there quietly and they blasted on the eggs and

293
00:18:48.601 --> 00:18:51.030
they keep them clean and they keep them safe from scavengers,

294
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:55.740
huge portion of their body mass goes to creating my eggs.

295
00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.410
And by the time those babies hatch, they

296
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:04.200
are at the end of their life. A lot of them are almost senile at that point.

297
00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:08.100
And that's where you see this very, very sad ending to the film,

298
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:13.020
but what's really fascinating is scientists have done pretty hardcore

299
00:19:13.021 --> 00:19:15.690
experiments where they've cut a nerve

300
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:21.210
in the octopus brain after they've it.

301
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.060
Uh, and once that nervous,

302
00:19:24.061 --> 00:19:28.590
severed the octopus kind of doesn't go into this behavior where they dedicate

303
00:19:28.591 --> 00:19:32.310
themselves to the eggs and they can live for twice as long. Wow.

304
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.970
Yeah, that's incredible.

305
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:42.570
So in a way they're literally sacrificing themselves for this,

306
00:19:42.571 --> 00:19:44.280
this new generation of octopus.

307
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:49.290
And you also have to kind of wonder if they didn't have such a

308
00:19:49.291 --> 00:19:54.030
short lifespan and they learned as quickly and grew as quickly as they do.

309
00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:56.560
I think we could have a problem.

310
00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:01.910
<v 2>Yeah. They'd be in charge down there, possibly up here or up here.</v>

311
00:20:01.911 --> 00:20:06.110
Yeah. Um, PIPA one of the cooler things I saw, but apart from the, you know,

312
00:20:06.111 --> 00:20:09.950
the death cycle, but one of the cooler things that we saw in, uh, in the film,

313
00:20:09.951 --> 00:20:14.720
and I think a lot of people know how octopuses can change their selves to

314
00:20:14.721 --> 00:20:16.160
blend in to their surroundings,

315
00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:20.750
but there was a whole new type of blending in that we saw from this octopus.

316
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.790
And maybe you can tell us a little about that.

317
00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.970
<v 0>Yeah. So we all know that octopuses can,</v>

318
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.790
can change the color and texture of their skin. Um,

319
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:35.180
they can make it smell spiky. They can make us foods that, um,

320
00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:40.730
there's a lot more to it than that. They, I mean, Jennifer professor,

321
00:20:40.731 --> 00:20:45.620
Jennifer Matha describes it as octopus language and they do have some

322
00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:50.260
really, really genius ways about smarting animals around them.

323
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.600
Um, and a lot of that strategy revolves around trying to say,

324
00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.840
trying to pretend to be something other than an octopus.

325
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.800
So sometimes you'll see, they'll make really, really dark,

326
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:07.360
huge eyes that makes them look 10 times bigger than they actually are.

327
00:21:07.361 --> 00:21:09.430
So their eyes will be black and their body will be wide.

328
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.490
Sometimes they'll move in a different way,

329
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.050
such as a scene where she's walking along the sea floor or pretend to be a rock

330
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.920
and then slowly move as they're being the rock.

331
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.600
And then you saw the scene where she turned into an old lady with the dress and

332
00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:26.230
the times,

333
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.890
and there is a shot in the phone where she like twelves on her legs up into

334
00:21:29.891 --> 00:21:33.550
little towers and stretches herself into this very strange position.

335
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.170
That's an octopus,

336
00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:40.870
just not wanting to look like an octopus because some things made it feel a

337
00:21:40.871 --> 00:21:44.980
bit uncomfortable and all it knows is it doesn't want to look by something that

338
00:21:44.981 --> 00:21:47.140
can be equal. Remember,

339
00:21:47.141 --> 00:21:50.620
this is an animal it's a snail that slice its shell.

340
00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:55.900
So it's highly, highly intelligent, but also incredibly vulnerable.

341
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:57.790
So that's why it's hard to become so clever.

342
00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:02.850
<v 2>And, and, and quickly like, that's the other thing, like, I mean,</v>

343
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.230
you would think it would take a lot of brain power to mimic something and to be

344
00:22:07.231 --> 00:22:07.951
able to do that in a year,

345
00:22:07.951 --> 00:22:12.150
a measure of a human could do learn this much in shape-shifting Pippa.

346
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.990
We've got a lot more questions about under the sea and octopuses and things like

347
00:22:15.991 --> 00:22:16.171
that.

348
00:22:16.171 --> 00:22:19.140
Are you able to stick around and join us for a few more questions on the other

349
00:22:19.141 --> 00:22:24.090
side? Perfect. Before we go, before we, uh,

350
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.440
leave the video viewers,

351
00:22:25.441 --> 00:22:28.770
maybe you can tell us what is the sea change project and how can people get

352
00:22:28.771 --> 00:22:29.604
involved?

353
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:34.170
<v 0>Okay. So the sea change project is a group of divers scientists,</v>

354
00:22:34.171 --> 00:22:37.860
storytellers. We're all based in Cape town,

355
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.620
on the shores of the great African sea first.

356
00:22:40.621 --> 00:22:45.210
And the great African CFRs is this incredible underwater forest that stretches

357
00:22:45.211 --> 00:22:48.810
from Namibia, uh,

358
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:53.370
on the West coast all the way around to a place called the hook in the East.

359
00:22:53.371 --> 00:22:57.840
It's about 1300 kilometers of coastline and it's an

360
00:22:57.841 --> 00:23:01.620
exquisite habitat. It's also a very, very healthy habitat,

361
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:05.670
at least as far as the cult itself is concerned. Um,

362
00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.020
but it's a place that hardly anyone's heard about before this film.

363
00:23:10.021 --> 00:23:14.550
I think very few people had ever even seen images of South Africa called forest.

364
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:20.220
So really what we're trying to do is make it an ecosystem that's known

365
00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:24.150
and make it an ecosystem with nerves and people's imaginations.

366
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:28.710
So that if at some point there is a dire threat to it,

367
00:23:28.711 --> 00:23:33.450
or is it some point there's an opportunity to push through legislation that

368
00:23:33.451 --> 00:23:37.260
supports its protection or supports the return of some of the big reef,

369
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:39.510
the species that have been fished out. For example,

370
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:46.340
we can get the support that we require from both the South African permanent

371
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.020
and the global public.

372
00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.300
<v 2>Well, it was a beautiful place. I'd never heard of the sea forest, myself,</v>

373
00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:56.530
the kelp forest, myself, and a, if you haven't seen my octopus teacher,

374
00:23:56.531 --> 00:23:58.480
make sure you go out and watch it on Netflix.

375
00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:00.520
Thanks very much PIPA for joining us.

376
00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.790
We'll hear more from Pippa on the other side and the audio podcast,

377
00:24:03.791 --> 00:24:06.640
the extended audio version, click on the link below. Uh,

378
00:24:06.641 --> 00:24:08.380
but otherwise thanks very much for joining us.

379
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:10.030
<v 0>Thank you so much.</v>

380
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.640
<v 1>So yes, as we, as we often do on the show, and as we often talk about,</v>

381
00:24:15.641 --> 00:24:19.630
we've learned a lot, anybody that's, that's watched the movie,

382
00:24:19.631 --> 00:24:22.630
my octopus teacher would have learned probably more than they ever would've

383
00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:26.650
expected to know about an octopus, but more importantly,

384
00:24:26.651 --> 00:24:31.450
I would argue were moved. They were affected. Um, they, they,

385
00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:36.340
they came out of that experience. I think not just with more knowledge,

386
00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.350
but what they care, right.

387
00:24:38.351 --> 00:24:41.140
Which was a huge accomplishment for them with this film.

388
00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:43.510
<v 2>The octopus, but what I really took away.</v>

389
00:24:43.511 --> 00:24:44.680
And it was right in the very beginning.

390
00:24:44.681 --> 00:24:47.620
And I think they probably wrapped it up very nicely at the end of the film as

391
00:24:47.621 --> 00:24:52.270
well, is that it all started with, uh, Craig's journey, um,

392
00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:56.530
trying to get closer to the earth and trying to be more connected to the earth.

393
00:24:56.531 --> 00:25:00.070
He saw the hunters in the Kalahari being able to track something and he

394
00:25:00.071 --> 00:25:02.890
realized, I don't know how to track anything. And in this film,

395
00:25:02.891 --> 00:25:07.420
we ended up learning how to track an octopus. So he actually got to do that,

396
00:25:07.421 --> 00:25:11.980
but just imagine if we all were more so connected to nature right now that we

397
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:15.040
could just like, look on the floor. Oh, I can tell that there was a mouse there,

398
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:18.340
you know, 10 hours ago and I can follow it and figure out where it is.

399
00:25:18.341 --> 00:25:21.430
Like if you had that ability, we've all lost that connection.

400
00:25:21.431 --> 00:25:25.630
We're such a disconnect. And, and unfortunately, uh, as you.

401
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:29.380
<v 1>You sort of touched on there what ultimately got him to do that,</v>

402
00:25:29.381 --> 00:25:34.210
was he proactively sick? No, he was burnt out and yeah, really,

403
00:25:34.211 --> 00:25:36.700
unfortunately often what is the, you know,

404
00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:41.290
the only thing that's going to drive people to reconnect with nature

405
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.300
in that way. That's so like,

406
00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:46.990
I wish I could say it in a way that didn't sound trite, but it's,

407
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:50.530
it's literally vital to like, if you,

408
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:54.880
if you talked to any scientists who studied human behavior, happiness, it's,

409
00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:59.370
it's, it's not just a luxury to say, you know, you gotta be connected.

410
00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:03.820
It's vital part of us that especially people who live in cities and in urban

411
00:26:03.821 --> 00:26:05.380
environments, they have that.

412
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.940
So little of that connection it's reflected in every part of our health that we

413
00:26:09.941 --> 00:26:12.700
don't necessarily. So you almost have to push yourself in his case.

414
00:26:12.701 --> 00:26:17.050
He was pushed. He did this out of the fact that he was kinda,

415
00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.750
he was checking not, I don't want to say checking out, but he was,

416
00:26:19.751 --> 00:26:20.500
he was burnt out.

417
00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.510
<v 2>Yeah. He really was. Um, you, you say people in cities,</v>

418
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.170
maybe more so than people in countries, but, uh, I'll tell you,

419
00:26:26.171 --> 00:26:30.100
I grew up in the country and I was not as connected, you know, you know,

420
00:26:30.101 --> 00:26:33.550
a lot more about what's happening around you, then people in the cities do,

421
00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:37.750
but you're still not connected to like, Oh, where that's a, this is a Fox,

422
00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.540
unless you're a Hunter perhaps. And you've learned that, um.

423
00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:45.780
<v 1>It's an intimate relationship like that requires and teaching and some sort</v>

424
00:26:45.781 --> 00:26:48.390
of relationship. And interestingly, you know, this,

425
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.600
we talk obviously a lot about science on what if discussed.

426
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.770
And of course this is a film that's been for the most part,

427
00:26:55.771 --> 00:26:59.340
I think entertaining for people in different ways.

428
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:04.560
But I would argue it has to be the most comprehensive research

429
00:27:04.561 --> 00:27:07.470
study scientifically of an octopus in history.

430
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:11.220
So there's value to that as well. I'm sure. I don't know if they have a relate.

431
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:11.610
I mean,

432
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:14.520
we talked with the sea change project and what's going to come out of that,

433
00:27:14.521 --> 00:27:18.600
but this really has to almost change the game and what we understand now about

434
00:27:18.601 --> 00:27:19.160
octopus.

435
00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.920
<v 2>Well, we, I mean, you're seeing thing yeah. To push this,</v>

436
00:27:21.921 --> 00:27:24.650
you're seeing things that you've never seen before. And you got to ask yourself,

437
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:27.340
ask yourself why, why have we never seen that before?

438
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.920
Because people haven't gone down there and studied it as closely.

439
00:27:30.921 --> 00:27:32.750
Like you'll when you watch the film,

440
00:27:32.751 --> 00:27:36.050
you'll see things that you've never seen before from an octopus in a nature

441
00:27:36.051 --> 00:27:36.884
documentary.

442
00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:41.540
And this guy Craig was down there sounds like pretty much every day

443
00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:46.230
of the octopus, his life from, from the time that they met, maybe like 80,

444
00:27:46.231 --> 00:27:48.230
80 to a hundred days into it. Um,

445
00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:52.040
but basically we saw the octopus on a daily basis.

446
00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:56.150
And I don't think that's, I'm guessing that's not been done in science.

447
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:59.930
This might be the most comprehensive study. Like you say, of an octopus.

448
00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:05.420
<v 1>And an incredible, you know, just an incredible endeavor PIPA talked about,</v>

449
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.990
you know, how this kind of came together, how long it took plenty of stuff.

450
00:28:08.991 --> 00:28:12.530
I want to get into a little more of that with her. Because again, it's just not,

451
00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.530
uh, it didn't just roll out of bed and do this, this that, you know,

452
00:28:15.531 --> 00:28:18.980
there's a bunch of stuff that had to come together here. And of course,

453
00:28:18.981 --> 00:28:19.641
as she talked about,

454
00:28:19.641 --> 00:28:22.880
they never in their wildest dreams could have expected this level of impact.

455
00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:26.840
<v 2>Never could. And if you're watching the video, podcasts also will join Pippa.</v>

456
00:28:26.841 --> 00:28:29.300
On the other side here, if you're watching the video podcasts,

457
00:28:29.301 --> 00:28:31.310
this is the end of the video podcast.

458
00:28:31.311 --> 00:28:35.360
So if you want to hear more with our guest Pippa, early-ish, uh,

459
00:28:35.361 --> 00:28:40.190
why don't you click on the link below here on the YouTube? Uh,

460
00:28:40.191 --> 00:28:42.650
that'll take you to the extended audio version. Now,

461
00:28:42.651 --> 00:28:44.630
if you're listening to the audio version,

462
00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.820
you're also listening to the extended audio version.

463
00:28:46.821 --> 00:28:49.790
You don't have to go looking around for anything else you're already there.

464
00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:52.490
So if you want to learn more about world under the sea,

465
00:28:52.491 --> 00:28:54.050
how to befriend an octopus.

466
00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.110
<v 1>Um, and my octopus teacher, the film, my.</v>

467
00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:00.970
<v 2>The film. Well, why don't you click on the link below, uh, if, uh,</v>

468
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:04.340
if that's all too complicated and you just gotta go, well, thanks for watching.

469
00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:07.820
And you can join us next time on what if discussed?

470
00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:12.680
