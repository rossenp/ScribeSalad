00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.310
<v 0>With COVID cases on the rise in many countries,</v>

2
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.050
the race to find an effective vaccine is becoming a more pressing

3
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:20.580
concern. Every day. The pharmaceutical company,

4
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.440
Pfizer has just announced that they have successfully produced a COVID-19

5
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:26.610
vaccine in the lab,

6
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.750
which is 95% effective against the virus.

7
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.850
Could this be the solution to the pandemic? And where do I sign up?

8
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.370
How long will it take for a vaccine to be readily available worldwide?

9
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.770
What makes the Pfizer COVID vaccine so unique

10
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.120
and who gets access to it first?

11
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.250
Can I call dibs on it?

12
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.150
This is what if,

13
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.890
and here's what would happen if a COVID vaccine were available to

14
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.353
Morrow

15
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.140
with over a million deaths and counting COVID-19 has

16
00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:14.060
hit hard in order to stop it in its tracks,

17
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.780
we'll need vaccines to be distributed worldwide,

18
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.450
but how can we determine which countries get the vaccine first?

19
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.310
Would the richest nations get access before the poorest ones

20
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.360
with lockdowns stifling, many countries economies,

21
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.460
could everyone afford it?

22
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.130
Some of the richer countries like the UK have signed expensive

23
00:01:40.131 --> 00:01:43.730
agreements with six potential Corona virus vaccines.

24
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.010
This has sparked contrary as hugging a vaccine before it's

25
00:01:49.011 --> 00:01:53.420
made leave vulnerable countries behind luckily the

26
00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:58.340
who or world health organization has created the Kovacs plan

27
00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.780
to level the playing field.

28
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.480
Its aim is to raise $2 billion by the year 2021 to

29
00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:08.510
help buy and fairly distributed vaccine.

30
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.830
Worldwide many countries are pooling their resources together,

31
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.630
and they hope to guarantee 92 lower income countries in Africa,

32
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.580
Asia, and Latin America, fast and fair access to the vaccine.

33
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.240
If this Kovacs plan works,

34
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.400
all the countries evolved will receive enough doses to vaccinate 20% of

35
00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:35.120
their population starting with the most vulnerable people. First,

36
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.970
this would include healthcare workers,

37
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.120
the elderly in nursing homes and their caretakers,

38
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.780
as well as people with medical conditions, putting them at risk,

39
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.740
then people over 65 would be next in line.

40
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.210
And finally people under the age of 50 will get it last.

41
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.730
These vaccinations will be distributed to convenient locations like schools,

42
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.880
pharmacies, and even train.

43
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.360
<v 1>Stations. Well, we won't know for sure.</v>

44
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.090
<v 0>Or how bad the pandemic will get before the vaccine is readily available.</v>

45
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.160
Researchers suggest that the death count could reach two and a half

46
00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:15.810
million by January.

47
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.540
But if we step up our acts wear masks and keep our distance,

48
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.480
this number could be a lot smaller.

49
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.460
So how exactly will this vaccine get approved?

50
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.030
<v 1>Well, first it must go through rigorous testing to ensure that it's safe.</v>

51
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.080
This can be a long and expensive process.

52
00:03:40.081 --> 00:03:44.820
And normally only about 10% of vaccine trials are

53
00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:48.000
successful before a vaccine can be tested.

54
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.770
It has to first undergo screenings and evaluations to determine which

55
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.240
antigen should be used.

56
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.930
Antigens are like the secret weapons of the vaccine.

57
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.330
They contain a small amount of the disease or virus causing organism to

58
00:04:03.331 --> 00:04:07.740
trigger an immune response in this preclinical phase.

59
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.870
Antigens are tested on animals which share similar genetic makeups to us.

60
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.970
If all goes well,

61
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.800
scientists will then start phase one where a small group of human

62
00:04:19.801 --> 00:04:24.600
volunteers are given the vaccine. Researchers and doctors will monitor.

63
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.190
If the right immune response is triggered and figure out the correct dosage for

64
00:04:29.191 --> 00:04:31.380
humans in phase two,

65
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.640
the vaccine is given to several hundred volunteers of varying age groups.

66
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.770
And finally, in phase three, thousands of volunteers will be tested.

67
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.200
These tests will be conducted across multiple countries to assure the results of

68
00:04:46.201 --> 00:04:49.350
the vaccine applied to many different populations.

69
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.360
After all is said and done,

70
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.890
each country will review the study data and decide whether to authorize the

71
00:04:55.891 --> 00:04:58.980
vaccine for use. Once it's made public,

72
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.390
the vaccine will need to be constantly monitored to ensure it works as it

73
00:05:03.391 --> 00:05:04.224
should.

74
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.960
So what's so special about this Pfizer vaccine and

75
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.600
when can we get it? Well,

76
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.470
the Pfizer vaccine is currently in phase three of testing.

77
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.780
Meaning it's being tested worldwide.

78
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.190
Companies are waiting for more data to come in before they begin manufacturing.

79
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.500
Unlike traditional vaccines,

80
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.180
the Pfizer vaccine uses a novel genetic technology that is on the

81
00:05:30.181 --> 00:05:34.290
forefront of science using synthetic M RNA.

82
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.930
The immune system is activated and fights.

83
00:05:36.931 --> 00:05:41.790
The virus M RNA vaccines are unique and have never

84
00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:44.250
been licensed for an infectious disease.

85
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.070
Traditionally vaccines inject small doses of the disease causing organism,

86
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.750
but M RNA vaccines trick the body into producing some of the viral

87
00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:59.480
proteins itself. Think of it as a tiny cellular magician,

88
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.500
instead of rabbits, he's pulling Corona viruses out of its hat,

89
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.130
Agra Corona. So far,

90
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.960
the vaccine has been tested on 43,500 people with only mild

91
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:16.070
side effects. It will require two doses. Three weeks apart.

92
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.290
Pfizer has reported that up to 50 million doses could be available globally by

93
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:22.310
the end of the year.

94
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.410
And they expect to have 1.3 billion doses ready in

95
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:28.670
2021,

96
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.480
while all this sounds hopeful,

97
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.510
one of the challenges will be distributing it.

98
00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:40.970
The vaccine must be kept at minus 70 degrees or below

99
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.740
in order to last six months,

100
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.320
this can eat up a lot of energy and money and can be a challenge

101
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.920
for top hospitals, let alone rural communities.

102
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.880
Hopefully the Kovacs plan will cover the costs.

103
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.930
Even if the vaccine is ready to go,

104
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.940
it will not be a quick fix and will likely take years before everyone

105
00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:06.980
is vaccinated. Well,

106
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.220
I hope it doesn't take more than two years.

107
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.040
Well guess what? That's a story for another.

108
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.210
What if.
