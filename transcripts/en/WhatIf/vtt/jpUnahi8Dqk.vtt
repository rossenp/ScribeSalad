00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.500
<v 0>Will you commit to making sure that there is a peaceful trans for all of power</v>

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.080
after the election going to have to see what happens.

3
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.320
President Trump has some concerns about the upcoming election.

4
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.200
Can you give a direct answer? You will accept the election.

5
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.540
I have to say that you will absolutely accept the result of this election.

6
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.130
I will look at it at the time.

7
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.360
He thinks the Democrats will corrupt the voting ballots.

8
00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:29.270
And if that appears to cost him the election,

9
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.480
he might not give up his power so easily.

10
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.600
He will not give up power under no circumstances.

11
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.190
Will he give up power? He intends to serve at least two more terms,

12
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.340
but how would that work?

13
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.790
If a sitting president loses Faron square,

14
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.020
can they still dispute the results and refuse to leave office?

15
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.610
Does the government have a peaceful solution for this,

16
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.440
or would he have to be removed by force?

17
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.990
This is what if,

18
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.700
and here's what would happen if president Trump loses and

19
00:01:10.701 --> 00:01:12.020
refuses to leave?

20
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.530
Many people think that the military would be the ones to force a defeated

21
00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:19.790
president from office.

22
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.200
I promise you I'm absolutely convinced they will escort him from the white house

23
00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:28.400
in a V it sprint dispatch, but that's not the case.

24
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.260
If there are any disputes over the outcome of an election,

25
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.090
it's up to the U S court system and the U S Congress to resolve them

26
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.980
not the U S military.

27
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.020
But what if the president doesn't trust their decision either?

28
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.740
Would it take a civil uprising to get them out?

29
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.050
Or is there a more sophisticated process already in place?

30
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.280
Only 22% of Americans believe that the upcoming

31
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:03.830
election will be free and fair.

32
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.130
There are many reasons for this skepticism,

33
00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:11.000
including potential corruption and tampering of the process.

34
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.520
And even without those,

35
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.620
the United States electoral system is already over complicated and

36
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.600
has lots of room for dispute. Just look at 2016,

37
00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:27.770
where the candidate with the most votes did not win the election.

38
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.560
One of the main reasons that the system is so complicated is because of

39
00:02:33.561 --> 00:02:36.200
something called the electoral college.

40
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.540
In most American elections, individuals are elected by popular vote,

41
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.720
but the president and vice-president are chosen by electors

42
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.580
in the electoral college.

43
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.860
Every state gets a number of electors based on their number of members of

44
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:55.694
Congress.

45
00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.880
There are 538 electors in total and each state's

46
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:03.450
political party chooses. It factors,

47
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.640
a presidential candidate needs at least 270 electors to

48
00:03:08.641 --> 00:03:13.260
win the presidential election. When someone votes for president,

49
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.300
the vote goes into a statewide tally. In most States,

50
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.630
all the elector votes go to the winner of that. Tally.

51
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.890
The constants Houston does not require the electors to follow their state's

52
00:03:25.891 --> 00:03:29.340
popular vote, but many States laws require it.

53
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.170
However,

54
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.850
there have been cases where electors challenged the laws and voted

55
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.050
against the popular opinion with all this considered.

56
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.850
You can see how this electoral process has lots of room for controversy.

57
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.940
So let's say president Trump loses fair and square this November,

58
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.890
but he says the results aren't clear enough for him to accept what

59
00:03:55.891 --> 00:03:56.880
would happen next

60
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.560
on January 20th,

61
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.510
he would skip the inauguration on Capitol Hill and instead would declare that

62
00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:07.740
the election was rigged.

63
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.640
The us military would salute president Biden,

64
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.200
meaning that Trump could no longer command them to do anything.

65
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.070
If he tried to and some members obeyed him,

66
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.780
they would be tried and convicted on mutiny and sedition charges.

67
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.820
Foreign leaders would cut off relations with the U S ambassadors awaiting

68
00:04:29.821 --> 00:04:31.800
instructions from president Biden.

69
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.320
Biden's acting attorney general would write up arrest warrants with president

70
00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:40.560
Trump with charges of criminal trespassing.

71
00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:45.270
At the very least Trump could remain in the oval office,

72
00:04:45.271 --> 00:04:48.300
but it would soon be cut off from power.

73
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.590
But this is all essentially a best case scenario.

74
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.243
In reality,

75
00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.960
things could get a lot more complicated as civilians might get

76
00:05:00.961 --> 00:05:04.590
involved. If Trump says that the election was rigged,

77
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.830
his passionate followers might take to the streets.

78
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.320
We've seen people explicitly declare support for Trump or use his slogans

79
00:05:13.321 --> 00:05:15.240
during acts of violence before.

80
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.850
So what would stop some of his more extreme supporters from rallying

81
00:05:20.851 --> 00:05:23.160
together to fight back for him this time,

82
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.440
any act of violence here could further separate the public into Democrats and

83
00:05:28.441 --> 00:05:31.710
Republicans even more severely than they are now.

84
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.510
And if the civilians don't trust the government to fix things,

85
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.320
could this lead to another civil war? Well,

86
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.690
let's hope it doesn't get that bad,

87
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.940
regardless of who wins this election. A lot of people are going to be upset,

88
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.400
but what's important is that the U S finds a way to move forward to become

89
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.250
a more unified nation. Wouldn't it be nice if we had a time machine,

90
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:02.030
so we could just skip into the future and see how this all plays out?

91
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.490
Well, that's a story for another, what if

92
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.330
they don't leave us just yet?

93
00:06:16.331 --> 00:06:20.020
