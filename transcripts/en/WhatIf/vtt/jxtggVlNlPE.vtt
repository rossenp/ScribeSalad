00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.550
<v 0>Before we get to today's episode,</v>

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.900
we'd just like to give a huge shout out to our sponsor. Squarespace.

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.790
Have you ever heard of the raw meat diet? That's right.

4
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.710
A diet that consists of eating raw meat all day. Every day.

5
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.020
Most of us have been taught to avoid Rami blankets, the plague,

6
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.870
but is it really that bad for you?

7
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.870
These people seem to be doing all right.

8
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:35.640
I guess what would be the best way to eat Rami?

9
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.340
How would it affect your body and what are the

10
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:45.810
benefits of this diet? This is what if,

11
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.100
and here's what would happen if you only ate raw meat

12
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.370
people on the Rami diet say that they eat it for health reasons because it's

13
00:00:56.371 --> 00:00:58.650
more nutritious. After all,

14
00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:03.570
some studies suggest that the process of cooking meat may reduce the

15
00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:08.010
content of certain vitamins and minerals, other raw meat,

16
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:12.570
enthusiasts report, having more energy and up boost and sex drive.

17
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.280
But none of this is supported by overwhelming evidence.

18
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.680
And even if it were,

19
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.850
would the good effects outweigh all the bad ones,

20
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.720
there's only one way to find out. Let's give it a try.

21
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.520
Before we get into the effects that an all Rami diet would have on your body,

22
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.090
let's look at how you would eat it in the first place.

23
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.650
You would have to cut up the raw meat into small bite sized pieces,

24
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.480
human teeth struggled to break down raw meat. They're almost useless.

25
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.670
We don't have the sharp canine teeth to chop and slice through Rami.

26
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.460
Our teeth are meant for grinding food.

27
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.380
If you were to bite a piece of raw game, you would struggle to chew it.

28
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.480
It would be like gum, and you'd just be chewing forever.

29
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.480
And it doesn't get any better once you swallow it because eating Rami

30
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.370
can do long-term damage to your body. I don't know about you,

31
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:20.370
but I could sure go for some cooked meat right about now.

32
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.670
<v 1>Let's be honest. So Rami versus cooked meat, I don't know what I'm picking.</v>

33
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.720
I love the barbecue too much. In fact, I'm making some beef Turkey right now.

34
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.490
Let's go, you can't smell this, but it's the smell of beef and smoke.

35
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.450
It's Hickory smoke and it's, uh, I had around, but I'm making, Oh my God.

36
00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.070
There it is. And it looks like it's just about done. So we'll make this quick.

37
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.380
Um, I make really good beef jerky.

38
00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:54.620
If I do say so myself and I've made so much of it over the years. And uh,

39
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.250
people tend to really like it that I actually thought about going into business

40
00:02:58.251 --> 00:03:02.470
with it, uh, starting full-time jerky business. This isn't a lie. Um,

41
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.100
but I'm not going to, I'm going to keep doing the,

42
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.230
what if series voice of what if,

43
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.340
but I did go ahead and make my own little beef jerky website.

44
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.180
There it is the best beef jerky you will ever eat.

45
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:20.800
And that is no lie. I wish you could taste it. Um, uh, sorry,

46
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:22.810
I can't give it to you. You know,

47
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.750
millions of people are now looking for extra ways to make cash,

48
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:30.550
or maybe even starting new businesses of their own going out, uh, making,

49
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:32.380
maybe making their own beef jerky business. Well,

50
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.570
one thing I would suggest if you are starting,

51
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:39.130
your business is do a website of your own. I would suggest using Squarespace,

52
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.450
the sponsor of this video,

53
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.690
not only does Squarespace have industry leading designs,

54
00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:46.780
it's also got a whole bunch of tools that help make your life easy.

55
00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:49.810
Whether it's their blogging tools or their workflow tools.

56
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.840
One thing that stood out for me was their social media integration content you

57
00:03:53.841 --> 00:03:57.790
post on your website can instantly be sent out to Twitter or Facebook.

58
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.600
But one of the cooler things about Squarespace is how easy they make it to help

59
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:05.710
sell weekly or monthly subscriptions. Think about it. Jerky of the month club.

60
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.200
Think about subscriptions. It's recurring monthly revenue or weekly revenue.

61
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.360
Anyways, it's a no brainer. Try it out,

62
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.810
go to squarespace.com and build your website for free.

63
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.280
When you're ready to launch,

64
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.330
go to squarespace.com/what if I can use the promo code?

65
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.080
What AF to get 10% off your first domain or website?

66
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.020
<v 0>Yeah, I could talk about barbecue and smoked meat all day long,</v>

67
00:04:34.021 --> 00:04:36.270
but that's not what's on the menu today.

68
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.960
Instead we have this raw meat.

69
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.130
Not only does it not look as appealing as cooked meat,

70
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.050
but it can also cause you a lot of trouble under cooked

71
00:04:49.051 --> 00:04:53.340
or raw meat and poultry can be contaminated with harmful bacteria,

72
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.150
such as e-coli salmonella and your Sinia.

73
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.620
If there are bacteria in the meat, it can make you really sick.

74
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.540
Usually this includes diarrhea, stomach cramps, vomiting,

75
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.860
and a fever.

76
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.560
And if you feel fine after eating your first Rameet dish, well,

77
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.300
just wait a little bit before passing judgment. After you've eaten the bacteria,

78
00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:23.130
it can take up to 24 hours to experience symptoms and they can

79
00:05:23.131 --> 00:05:26.070
last for many days, depending on the type of bacteria.

80
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.660
If you still want to proceed with the diet,

81
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.190
you'll need to be careful of what kind of meat you'll be putting in your body.

82
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.750
You might want to stay away from chicken because it tends to contain more

83
00:05:39.751 --> 00:05:41.790
harmful bacteria like salmonella.

84
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.940
Since chicken has a more poorest structure,

85
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.810
it's easier for bacteria to penetrate deep into the meat.

86
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.510
That's the reason why when you're cooking chicken,

87
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.230
you can't just sear the surface to kill all the pathogens.

88
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.570
Also to reduce your chances of eating bacteria, filled meat.

89
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.060
You should only eat locally sourced and organic meats that have not been overly

90
00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:09.380
processed. And that would quickly start to get really expensive.

91
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.790
But according to Romita enthusiasts, it would all be worth it.

92
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.690
They say that once your body gets used to eating Rami,

93
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.540
you'll get a lot more nutrients and protein.

94
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.430
And you would from the cooked alternatives in one serving of raw ground beef,

95
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.750
you get a whole 17 grams of protein. However,

96
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:34.580
there is such a thing as too much protein research shows that eating more

97
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:39.500
than two grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily can cause symptoms

98
00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:43.490
of dehydration, nausea, irritability, headache,

99
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:44.600
and indigestion.

100
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.980
It can also increase your risk of severe health problems,

101
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:51.740
such as cardiovascular disease, liver,

102
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:54.260
and kidney injuries and even death.

103
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.690
So maybe spending your days eating raw meat. Isn't the best idea.

104
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.880
If you're going to go for a raw diet,

105
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.920
it's best to also include raw vegetables and to get nutrients from other

106
00:07:08.921 --> 00:07:10.930
foods instead of just raw meat.

107
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:16.210
It's also important to note that just because our ancestors did something a

108
00:07:16.211 --> 00:07:18.790
certain way, doesn't mean that we have to.

109
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.500
Can you imagine if we all lived our lives? Like we were Neanderthals?

110
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.600
Well, that's a story for another. What if.
