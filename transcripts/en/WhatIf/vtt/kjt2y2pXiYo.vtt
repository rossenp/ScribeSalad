1
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.810
<v 1>The mega earthquake it's coming.</v>

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.340
We don't know exactly when or how big it's going to be,

3
00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:15.420
but it's coming. It will be chaotic.

4
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.870
And with millions of lives on the brink,

5
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.100
California will be put to the ultimate test.

6
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.450
What kind of devastation could we be dealing with?

7
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.440
Is California ready for something like this?

8
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.340
And what would be the economic impact?

9
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.660
This is what if, and here's what would happen.

10
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.280
If a mega earthquake happens in California tomorrow

11
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.060
1800 people will die.

12
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.760
1600 fires will ignite 750 people

13
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.800
will be trapped inside buildings.

14
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.320
270,000 people will be unable to return

15
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:02.154
home.

16
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.450
And 50,000 people will need emergency care.

17
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.580
Search and rescue efforts will last for 19 days.

18
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.080
These numbers are from the United States geological survey.

19
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.690
They've estimated that if a 7.8 earthquake hits along the

20
00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:26.310
Southern San Andreas fault on a non windy day at about 9:00 AM,

21
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.550
we will be thrust into this frightening scenario.

22
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.660
They are also warning that there's a 20% chance.

23
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.930
The big one could hit the San Andreas fault.

24
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.540
Sometime in the next 30 years,

25
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.730
some experts predict it could be a catastrophic 8.2

26
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:45.840
magnitude quake.

27
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.630
So what is the San Andreas fault? Well,

28
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.040
it's a boundary between the Pacific plate and the North American plate.

29
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.860
The fault extends into California,

30
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.480
roughly 1200 kilometers from Cape Mendocino to the

31
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:07.650
Mexican border cities like San Diego, Los Angeles,

32
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.320
and big Sur sit on the Pacific plate.

33
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.570
The North American plate has San Francisco Sacramento and the

34
00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:16.404
Sierra.

35
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.380
<v 0>San Andrea is a transform fault. This.</v>

36
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.230
<v 1>Is when two plates slide past one another.</v>

37
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.480
The average speed of the moving plates is 0.6

38
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.160
centimeters per year. Although this doesn't seem like much,

39
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.200
they will actually launch themselves together and not move for years.

40
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.110
And this is where the problem starts.

41
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.160
Imagine the damage has built up strain,

42
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.490
finally releases and breaks the rock along the fault.

43
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.050
This causes the plates to shift a few feet all at once.

44
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.120
The sudden release of energy creates seismic waves and it's these

45
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.780
waves that we feel as earthquakes.

46
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.030
The San Andreas fault has experienced massive earthquakes in the past.

47
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.280
The great 1906 San Francisco earthquake is one of the most

48
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:14.740
significant earthquakes of all time.

49
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.210
At 5:12 AM. On the morning of April 18th,

50
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.510
a foreshock was felt throughout the Bay area.

51
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.630
Then 20 to 25 seconds later,

52
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.830
the earthquake hit the estimated magnitude was

53
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:34.600
7.9 and the violent shocks lasted for 45 to

54
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:35.620
60 seconds.

55
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.880
It was so powerful that it was felt from Southern Oregon,

56
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.940
South of Los Angeles, and inland, as far as central Nevada,

57
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.760
it's been estimated that around 21 to 2,800 people

58
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.690
died that day.

59
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.670
If the men big earthquake hits California tomorrow,

60
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.360
what sort of devastation could we be dealing with?

61
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.670
If it is the big one,

62
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.230
it would have a magnitude of about eight that would rupture a

63
00:04:07.231 --> 00:04:11.880
322 kilometer stretch along the Southern most part of the fault

64
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.320
buildings built before 1980 are in danger of collapsing.

65
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.810
A recent study suggests that up to 25% of the buildings constructed to the

66
00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:25.740
current earthquake code will be unusable. After the quake,

67
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.990
after the big one,

68
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.760
explosions could be triggered and fires would erupt throughout the devastated

69
00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:33.594
cities.

70
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.700
Landslides could lead to more fatalities and damage electricity

71
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.570
and sewage could come to a halt along with transportation

72
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.470
highways, railways, airport runways,

73
00:04:46.471 --> 00:04:50.640
and bridges could become unstable for weeks, even months.

74
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.410
One of our basic survival needs is access to fresh water,

75
00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:57.870
which would be difficult after the quake.

76
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.580
The major aqueduct infrastructure that pumps water into Southern California

77
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.770
crosses the San Andreas fault.

78
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.460
So it seems unlikely that this would be unaffected.

79
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.960
Now,

80
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.550
if you're thinking it couldn't get any worse than that parts of the San Andreas

81
00:05:14.551 --> 00:05:18.150
fault also intersect with oil and gas pipelines.

82
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.320
If these pipelines break the lethal consequences,

83
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.340
both for human health and the environment will be devastating,

84
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.750
but what is the economic impact? Well,

85
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.830
California has the fifth largest economy in the world.

86
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.570
So not only would the effects be felt by California and the United States,

87
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.850
they would also impact the world.

88
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.960
The estimated cost of the big one is

89
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.210
$200 billion.

90
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.310
33 billion of this comes from property damage and 50 billion in

91
00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:54.750
lost economic activity.

92
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.990
Less than 20% of buildings are covered by earthquake insurance.

93
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.590
So most people will need to pay the rebuilding costs.

94
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.320
These same people might decide to relocate to other parts of the U S

95
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.720
this trend in the dropping population was observed in Los Angeles after the two

96
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:18.260
earthquakes of 1971 and 1994,

97
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.730
the population decreased for two years after both quakes.

98
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.190
And these were relatively small having magnitudes of 6.5 and

99
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:32.270
6.7. Then there's the business impact,

100
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.350
not just to California from the mass Exodus of population,

101
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.820
but also California's importance to the rest of the United States.

102
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:46.040
Over 40% of total imports to the U S come in through Los

103
00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:47.780
Angeles and long beach ports.

104
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.890
And with the massive disruption of transportation routes,

105
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.560
especially those that crossed the San Andres fault.

106
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.390
Getting these goods to the rest of the country will be difficult to say the

107
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:00.224
least.

108
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.450
So with the largest us economy and the fifth largest in the world

109
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.220
crushed, would this send us into another global economic crash?

110
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:16.460
What, what the future of the U S and global economy look like after this?

111
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.800
Well, that's a story for another. What if.
