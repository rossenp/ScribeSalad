1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.060
<v 0>As a matter of fact, the universe always existed.</v>

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.130
And once we believe as a beginning,

3
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:08.880
by just the transition from a contracting faced on expanding physically or the

4
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:11.160
bounce, the big bang side,

5
00:00:11.161 --> 00:00:15.300
you can explain certain features of the universe that the big bang idea that

6
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.710
that was a beginning cannot think about if he is not a good future,

7
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.300
this is a sign of some sickness.

8
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.000
So Peter.

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.600
<v 1>I'm guessing you are familiar with the big bang theory.</v>

10
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.180
<v 2>Well, I think you're talking about the 12 year running a Emmy award winning</v>

11
00:00:44.181 --> 00:00:48.590
CBS comedy, the big bang theory, but, uh, I'm not, I haven't actually,

12
00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:49.910
I never actually watched that show,

13
00:00:49.911 --> 00:00:54.560
but I am a huge fan of a young Sheldon, which is, I guess,

14
00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:59.270
the story before Sheldon became Sheldon. But I don't know any of the characters,

15
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.790
uh, Sheldon or, I mean, I obviously know Sheldon,

16
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:04.040
but I don't know anything about the big stuff. No, I don't know anything.

17
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.821
<v 1>Parsons.</v>

18
00:01:04.821 --> 00:01:08.300
The guy that played Sheldon who actually sort of became the star of that show.

19
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.590
Uh, and like you mentioned 12 years, it was the number one sit-com I wasn't,

20
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.100
I didn't watch it religiously. I did, uh, you know, I'm,

21
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.880
I'm familiar with the storyline and obviously they dealt with, with,

22
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.000
throughout the show, some of the top names in fizz, Neil deGrasse,

23
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.570
Tyson made appearances bill Nye of course famously, uh,

24
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.430
made appearances on the big bang theory.

25
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.810
And we're lucky enough to get some of the luminaries of the world of physics and

26
00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:35.570
science. Join us here on what if discuss, but yes,

27
00:01:35.571 --> 00:01:38.450
it wasn't talking about the show. I was talking about the actual big bang,

28
00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:40.280
the big bang theory. Yes.

29
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.020
<v 2>You mean the thing that the universe started from a pea-sized singularity</v>

30
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.940
14 billion years ago give or take a hundred million years and we're here now

31
00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:52.760
expanding from that, uh, from that explosion.

32
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.520
<v 1>Yes. That's what they say. Uh, and again,</v>

33
00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.740
one of the things that we forget in that title of both the sit-com and what

34
00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:03.840
you're talking about is the word theory. We,

35
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:07.640
we often sort of just take it for granted that this is an absolute,

36
00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:09.920
of course these things are always changing.

37
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:13.130
They're always being revised as he was there at the time. Nobody,

38
00:02:13.131 --> 00:02:17.300
I haven't seen a video. Right. Um, so like science,

39
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:20.030
it's always evolving. It's changing when we figure new things out,

40
00:02:20.031 --> 00:02:23.000
we develop new technologies and this is no different.

41
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.750
And of course now the big bang theory, I'm not saying it's on its way out,

42
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.370
but it's certainly being challenged now by theories that are,

43
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.890
that answer some of the questions, the big bang theory,

44
00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:38.450
didn't like the big bounce theory and cyclical universe theory.

45
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.370
<v 2>The big bounce theory, meaning that we are bouncing.</v>

46
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.330
<v 1>Not like a bungee cord or a yoga ball or a</v>

47
00:02:47.331 --> 00:02:50.060
basketball. Um, but yes, I mean,

48
00:02:50.061 --> 00:02:53.480
there is some sort of contraction and, uh,

49
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.540
or expansion and contraction thing going on again. Well,

50
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.340
so it's like one of those, uh, paddle ball fields. Excellent. Well,

51
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:03.790
this is the type of explanation you get when you, and I try to break it down.

52
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.740
So I'll give you two options. You could,

53
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.690
we could either continue this or you could actually hear the

54
00:03:10.691 --> 00:03:15.550
explanation from probably the preeminent person on the planet working on the big

55
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.720
bounce theory right now.

56
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.000
<v 2>I'm curious to continue with this and see how you use.</v>

57
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.920
<v 1>Yes, well, this I, she isn't, she is a theoretical physicist.</v>

58
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.770
I am a theoretical theoretical physicist.

59
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.930
And I think in the end probably option a would be the, the,

60
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:35.610
the place where we're going to have more answers theoretically, theoretically,

61
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.500
on fire today. Um,

62
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.300
so our guest today for what if the universe was

63
00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:43.890
bouncing is.

64
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.840
<v 2>Well, it's Dr. Anna,</v>

65
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.580
[inaudible] a theoretical physicist working in gravitation and cosmology at the

66
00:03:50.581 --> 00:03:53.820
max Planck Institute for gravitational physics in Germany.

67
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.900
Her research is aimed at the most fundamental questions about the universe.

68
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.540
What is the mechanism that created our universe?

69
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.800
What is the universe composed of and how will it be changing in the future

70
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.470
before joining the max plunk society? Dr. [inaudible] held the inaugural John A.

71
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.520
Wheeler post-doctoral fellowship at the Princeton center for theoretical science

72
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.900
and spent the following two years as a research faculty and principal

73
00:04:18.901 --> 00:04:23.220
investigator of the origins of the universe initiative at the Columbia center

74
00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:28.020
for theoretical physics and Harvard's Institute for theory and computation.

75
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.570
<v 1>Yes. Thanks for joining us today on what if discussed?</v>

76
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.210
<v 0>Oh, it's great to be here. Thanks, Richard.</v>

77
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.360
<v 1>Uh, not a small question, obviously. How did the universe form,</v>

78
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.850
what is the origin of the universe?

79
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.690
And one could be forgiven for believing that, Oh,

80
00:04:48.691 --> 00:04:50.490
we've already figured that out, right? I mean,

81
00:04:50.491 --> 00:04:54.570
religion for years kind of had so many people think they have different origin

82
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.520
theories on kind of how we arrived here. And then science kind of took over, uh,

83
00:04:59.521 --> 00:05:01.590
you know, four or 500 years ago,

84
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.210
ultimately culminating in the big bang theory being kind of what we've sort of

85
00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:08.580
all agreed on is the origins of the universe.

86
00:05:08.581 --> 00:05:12.570
But theory is really the key word in the sentence. And there's still a lot of,

87
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.160
to be determined, especially with your work kind of looking at it differently.

88
00:05:17.161 --> 00:05:19.830
So I'll ask the question this way. Uh,

89
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.120
Dr. Esh in the beginning, there was what.

90
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.530
<v 0>Um, no beginning. Um, excellent.</v>

91
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.510
But what I believe is that instead of a bank that actually was a

92
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.760
bounds and is balance to customer phase of contraction before

93
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.560
to a phase of expansion after, and this expansion is still lasting.

94
00:05:43.561 --> 00:05:45.420
So we are currently in expanding phase.

95
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.280
And the cool idea is here that all the features of the universe.

96
00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.350
So the distribution of Mather it's geometric ecstasy today, um,

97
00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.020
or three back and over generated during this phase and the universe contracted

98
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:03.560
down to small size and bounce back to our current expanding phase.

99
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.850
<v 2>So we tend to always think of things in a, in a dualism manner. You know,</v>

100
00:06:09.851 --> 00:06:12.640
it's an, it's an either or for most of the things that we, uh,

101
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.590
think of like a King Kong versus Godzilla or Batman

102
00:06:17.591 --> 00:06:22.450
versus Superman or a Superman, yeah. One or the other.

103
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.430
So, but, uh, with the big bang theory versus the bank bounce theory,

104
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.400
it sounds like you can't have one without the other. Am I right?

105
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.000
<v 0>Um, no, I would disagree. These are really two distinct ideas.</v>

106
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.350
So to one idea,

107
00:06:38.351 --> 00:06:42.130
the big bang theory says that space and time really had a beginning.

108
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.330
And since this beginning it's always been expanding and always will be

109
00:06:46.331 --> 00:06:48.730
expanding. And the other idea,

110
00:06:48.731 --> 00:06:53.380
the idea of there being a big bounce preceding or expanding

111
00:06:53.381 --> 00:06:57.610
phase, it says no, there was no beginning. As a matter of fact,

112
00:06:57.611 --> 00:06:59.080
the universe always existed.

113
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.190
And what we believe was the beginning was just a transition from a contracting

114
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.250
phase on expanding physical the bands. So not only that,

115
00:07:06.251 --> 00:07:09.970
these two ideas I competing, yeah. I really incompatible.

116
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.440
And the struggle is to figure out which one is the right idea.

117
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.350
So was there a beginning or was there no beginning,

118
00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:21.520
but a bounce and the unfortunate situation today that he actually can figure

119
00:07:21.521 --> 00:07:24.010
this out, but with using our mathematics,

120
00:07:24.011 --> 00:07:27.370
using our computers or simulations and using experiments.

121
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.540
And as a matter of fact,

122
00:07:28.541 --> 00:07:32.740
I would say recent work that I have done together with collaborators has shown

123
00:07:32.741 --> 00:07:36.310
that the big band side, you can explain certain features of the universe,

124
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.490
that the big bang idea that there was a beginning cannot.

125
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.920
<v 1>Hm. So it's more about the infinite versus the finite, I guess,</v>

126
00:07:44.921 --> 00:07:49.600
to some degree, right. Some degree it's true. Yes. Well, that's, I mean,

127
00:07:49.601 --> 00:07:52.300
it's hard to get your head around and it's interesting because you hear,

128
00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:57.070
you know, the cyclical universe theory, which sounds, I guess,

129
00:07:57.071 --> 00:08:01.690
closer to what you're talking about and maybe is more compatible with balance

130
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.770
because it's, there is no beginning it's, it's kind of going in and out.

131
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:09.400
I've heard it explained kind of again, expanding and contraction.

132
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.270
And we've heard about the big crunch theory, which would,

133
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.800
I guess you'd have quite the six pack as a universe if there was a lot of

134
00:08:17.801 --> 00:08:19.960
crunches, but in that regard,

135
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.710
if it's expanding and contracting bouncing,

136
00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:28.030
if you will in a cycle, then, I mean,

137
00:08:28.031 --> 00:08:31.330
it sounds almost like breathing. Is that, is that a fair at the macro sense?

138
00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:33.880
It's almost like inhaling and exhaling.

139
00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.390
<v 0>It's not quite like that. You are right.</v>

140
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:41.980
The earlier almost all ideas that involve the cyclic universe or the universe

141
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:46.870
underwent infinite periods of contraction and expansion connected by a

142
00:08:46.871 --> 00:08:49.720
Basque. People really taught that it was more like breathing,

143
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:53.350
but that's not true for the kind of new,

144
00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:57.420
new kind of cyclic ideas that I'm exploring together with my group.

145
00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.250
So in the,

146
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.180
or the idea of what you are quoting is people told that after the bands,

147
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:08.010
so universe was expanding by a certain amount and then contracted by the same

148
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:08.844
amount.

149
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.930
But what we think today is that instead of what happens is that the universe

150
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.840
expands a lot more than it contracts.

151
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.910
And this is quite cool because it turns out that all the problems of the earlier

152
00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:25.080
ideas, but the fact that people thought of the universe as a six pack.

153
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:30.360
But if you make the universe expand a lot more than, than it contracts,

154
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:35.430
then you can solve all the problems with what cyclic models and ended up with a

155
00:09:35.431 --> 00:09:39.900
universe that keeps growing, growing, and growing and on the reason.

156
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.920
But we don't see in a sacrifice universe that that's the case is because we are

157
00:09:43.921 --> 00:09:47.760
local observers. And so the officer rub would think this is just like breathing,

158
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:48.720
but it's not the case.

159
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.860
<v 1>Ah, um, the,</v>

160
00:09:50.861 --> 00:09:55.370
the singularity or the primeval atom that they sometimes call it is, uh,

161
00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.170
a big part of the big bang theory.

162
00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:01.790
The big bounce gets criticized for bypassing the singularity.

163
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.610
Um, how can we understand that piece of the puzzle?

164
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.910
<v 0>Oh, that's perhaps a misunderstanding because you know,</v>

165
00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:15.560
a singularity is not a good feature. Usually when a theory,

166
00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:19.670
um, that we have in physics has a singularity to then be considered that as a

167
00:10:19.671 --> 00:10:20.504
problem,

168
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:24.730
it is a sign of some sickness it's sign it's the sign that the theory breaks,

169
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:26.810
then anything contours the singularity.

170
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.360
So actually what people have been trying to do,

171
00:10:29.361 --> 00:10:31.280
even in the context of the big bang theory,

172
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.060
to explain the beginning without the singularity, without the sickness.

173
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.560
And I personally, and I would say my colleagues to consider, uh,

174
00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.850
the absence of a singularity theory, real advantage of the big bang theory.

175
00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.620
You can cure the sickness of that.

176
00:10:45.621 --> 00:10:49.610
Being a singularity by eliminating the bank and replacement, get a bounce.

177
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.990
<v 1>I liked the, uh, the sickness idea of it because I mean, to be honest, it's,</v>

178
00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.510
it wouldn't be the first time that somebody brought up the,

179
00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.080
the big bang theory in my life where I was like, so let me get this straight.

180
00:11:00.081 --> 00:11:01.250
You're saying that the,

181
00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:05.030
all the energy in the universe came from a piece size single air

182
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:10.280
and kind of what B, but the obvious followup has always been well,

183
00:11:10.281 --> 00:11:14.810
what became, what came before the singularity? And generally speaking,

184
00:11:14.811 --> 00:11:16.410
people have been like, wow, we, we,

185
00:11:16.411 --> 00:11:19.520
we don't know which to your point is the breakdown in the theory,

186
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:23.750
you're somebody that also has an interest in the philosophy of science.

187
00:11:23.751 --> 00:11:25.400
You've studied it, you've written about it.

188
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:30.800
And this feels to me where we get into a little more philosophical,

189
00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:35.540
even esoteric because for the finite human being with our dualistic

190
00:11:35.541 --> 00:11:38.810
minds, small dualistic, small dualistic minds,

191
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.470
the idea of infinity is just an abstraction.

192
00:11:42.471 --> 00:11:46.880
It's so hard to get our heads around yet. It's a key piece of this puzzle.

193
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:52.280
How do we, how do we know this? Let's call it the unknowable and how do we,

194
00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.400
how do we infinity?

195
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.750
<v 0>Okay, that's a tough one because you know,</v>

196
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.870
the question is if it's important to understand that

197
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:10.090
in the study of physics in particular, during the last hundred years,

198
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.010
we have uncontrolled situations,

199
00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.450
then we just couldn't understand or imagine things that turned out to be true.

200
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.490
So take, for example, quantum physics,

201
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.470
it's really difficult to understand or imagine that a single electron can

202
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.140
pull through several slits, right.

203
00:12:26.141 --> 00:12:30.520
At the same time and behaves like Vive don't don't understand it.

204
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:35.170
We don't really imagine it, but what turns out is that in the F in physics,

205
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.010
we very often encounter situations when we have to live with things,

206
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:42.820
we have to accept things. But the previous, I taught not to be true,

207
00:12:42.821 --> 00:12:47.200
not to be imaginable. And I believe it is similar with the universe. You know,

208
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.330
if an experiment or if, if,

209
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.990
if we invent theories that tell us that the universe might be infinite,

210
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:57.340
and we find experiment that show us that that really is the better explanation

211
00:12:57.341 --> 00:12:59.530
than assuming a finite universe.

212
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:04.840
Then we probably be our first have to live with it without truly understanding

213
00:13:04.841 --> 00:13:09.580
or, or imagining it just by the way that that's the better explanation, uh,

214
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.940
being taught us by experiments. So this is a strange situation.

215
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:14.910
<v 1>Yeah. And it's,</v>

216
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:19.440
it's like a lot of you hear about some people talking about no time and space,

217
00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:22.560
and although I can say, okay, I can,

218
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.500
I can understand what you mean,

219
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.460
but I can't understand no there's time and space. Like,

220
00:13:29.461 --> 00:13:34.200
it just feels like something that's such a, an integral part of this existence,

221
00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:39.030
but the lack of time is just something so abstract for our human minds.

222
00:13:39.031 --> 00:13:42.270
Or at least my human mind, I am in space. There is time. Yes,

223
00:13:42.271 --> 00:13:46.080
I would say as well, but these are obviously, uh,

224
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:51.000
some bigger questions, which we will, we will follow up with you, uh,

225
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.340
after we take a little break here, because there's,

226
00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:57.540
there's certainly more to get to. Um, but we really, I mean,

227
00:13:57.541 --> 00:14:01.770
thanks for taking us through this particular, in the beginning scenario,

228
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.740
or at least one of the scenarios of in the beginning,

229
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.790
where can people follow your work right now? And what do you have coming up?

230
00:14:08.791 --> 00:14:12.870
Because it sounds like you're on the cusp of some pretty big game-changing

231
00:14:12.871 --> 00:14:13.710
theories.

232
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:19.800
<v 0>I hope so. Certainly, uh, this is pretty simple. So we have a website,</v>

233
00:14:19.801 --> 00:14:23.820
my group has a backside. It is also simply it's called advancing cosmology.com.

234
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:29.220
And there you find me, my bio links to my personal website.

235
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:30.000
Um,

236
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.260
the people I work with and that descriptions are papers that they put out and

237
00:14:34.261 --> 00:14:38.670
perhaps most interesting for, for, for the viewers, uh, is that we have,

238
00:14:38.671 --> 00:14:41.430
there was a links to videos and videos, uh,

239
00:14:41.431 --> 00:14:43.980
that some of them are quite accessible for,

240
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:48.420
for people who don't everyday and every night work on the bands.

241
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.790
<v 1>Like, like, like Peter and I.</v>

242
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.410
<v 3>Small brain people.</v>

243
00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.740
<v 2>Um, well, if you like this episode, and I don't know why you wouldn't, yeah.</v>

244
00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.950
Maybe you'd like to dig a little bit deeper and you can,

245
00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:07.600
because we're going to go a little bit deeper on our extended audio podcasts.

246
00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:11.650
<v 1>Yes. Which I'm in and who knows by the end of this, we might have, uh, we,</v>

247
00:15:11.651 --> 00:15:13.540
we might've figured out, uh,

248
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.300
how the universe started and perhaps more importantly,

249
00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.130
where is the universe going? Maybe.

250
00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.380
<v 2>We're on the cusp of, of solving. It feels like.</v>

251
00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:23.260
<v 1>We are, but, uh, you know, probably in the next 20 minutes,</v>

252
00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.900
we'll probably just scratch the surface. Uh,

253
00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.990
Dr. [inaudible] thanks for joining us today on what if discussed?

254
00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:34.630
<v 3>Thanks so much. Thanks. So, uh,</v>

255
00:15:34.631 --> 00:15:35.590
yeah. Wow.

256
00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.150
<v 1>I don't know where to start. That's.</v>

257
00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:41.470
<v 2>I can't know where to start because as Dr. Yesh says, there's no beginning,</v>

258
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.850
and there is no end, right.

259
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.600
<v 1>That is perfect. Which again, it's really hard to get your head around.</v>

260
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.280
I learned a lot and I love, I love how she describes what she's working on,

261
00:15:51.281 --> 00:15:54.280
but there's a reason why there's only a few people in the world that are working

262
00:15:54.281 --> 00:15:55.180
on these types of things,

263
00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:59.890
because they have the minds that can sort of even deal with the infinite

264
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.900
me. On the other hand, it ends up being kind of more questions than answers.

265
00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.880
Yeah. Well, uh, here's the thing.

266
00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:11.590
<v 2>The thing is that we have more questions and we'll get more answers on the other</v>

267
00:16:11.591 --> 00:16:16.480
side. On the other side, if you liked this interview and you want to learn more,

268
00:16:16.481 --> 00:16:18.400
maybe you want to learn infinitely more.

269
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:23.140
Maybe you want to contract a little bit and not learn on fire either way.

270
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:27.760
Why don't you click on the link below and that'll take you to the extended audio

271
00:16:27.761 --> 00:16:30.880
version. Now, if you're already listening to the extended audio version,

272
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.150
don't go looking for a link. Cause there is no link. Just keep listening,

273
00:16:34.151 --> 00:16:38.020
just keep listening. That's all there is to it. Uh, we'd like to thank Dr.

274
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:41.320
[inaudible] again, and please join us again next week on.

275
00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.580
<v 3>What if disgust.</v>
