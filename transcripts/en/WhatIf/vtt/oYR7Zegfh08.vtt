00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.960
<v 0>The deadline, the pressure, the anxiety,</v>

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.970
the stress is too much to bear. How will you get through the night?

3
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.260
Coffee's not working? And you're desperate. What's this

4
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.050
kind of doing the trick, feeling a bit weird. And it's like,

5
00:00:22.051 --> 00:00:23.940
you have wings.

6
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.010
What is red bull can too much of it hurt you?

7
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.480
And what happens to your body when you drink it?

8
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.240
This is what is,

9
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.610
and here's what would happen if you drank 1000 red bulls in a month

10
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.130
in parts of the United States,

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.650
grass roots movements are pressuring officials to restrict the sale of

12
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.860
energy drinks to minors due to severe health concerns from binge drinking.

13
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.730
Red bull is one of various brands being targeted.

14
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.430
So what is red bull?

15
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.080
It was first developed in Thailand as a drink to improve stamina.

16
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.050
And it's been around since the late 1970s,

17
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.970
although it didn't become popular until an Austrian marketer discovered it in

18
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:18.590
1984, three years later, the red bull gives you wings.

19
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.300
Slogan made its debut.

20
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.310
And since then 82 billion cans have been chugged back

21
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.930
with seven and a half billion of those in 2019 alone,

22
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.480
one can have regular red bull contains caffeine, sucrose, glucose,

23
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.650
citric acid, taurine, vitamin B12, carbonated, water, sodium, bicarbonate,

24
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.860
calcium panteth, innate, and artificial and natural colors,

25
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.590
including flavors sounds perfectly healthy, right?

26
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.640
That might depend on what your definition of healthy is,

27
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.560
but can too much red bull hurt you? Well, one,

28
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:56.210
250 milliliter.

29
00:01:56.211 --> 00:02:00.950
Red bull contains 80 milligrams of caffeine and a whopping

30
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.420
27 grams of sugar. If you drink one of these,

31
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.010
the effects might not be too bad, but pounding back one after another.

32
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.070
And we'll definitely leave you in a jittery mess.

33
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.590
And curiously over 34 deaths have been linked

34
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.330
to the intake of energy drinks other than caffeine and

35
00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:24.080
sugar.

36
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.700
The excessive amounts of B vitamins and high taurine levels will cause you

37
00:02:28.701 --> 00:02:33.230
problems. B vitamins are good for you and can ease stress,

38
00:02:33.231 --> 00:02:35.870
but too much of them can be dangerous.

39
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.660
High levels of B3 and B6 can cause gastrointestinal problems.

40
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.650
Liver toxicity, blurry, vision and nerve damage.

41
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.053
Likewise,

42
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.950
taurine is an amino acid that helps in neurological development and

43
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.350
regulates water and minerals in the blood.

44
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.150
But you shouldn't overdo that either in animal studies,

45
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.330
increased ingestion of taurine has been shown to decrease body weight and

46
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:05.380
cause dehydration.

47
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.020
So what would happen if you drank 1000 red bulls

48
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.210
in a month? The math is daunting drinking.

49
00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:19.950
1000 red bulls in 31 days means gulping 32

50
00:03:19.951 --> 00:03:23.850
cans of the stuff each day. That's two cans per hour.

51
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.620
If you stop for eight hours of sleep, since there's no time to lose,

52
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.850
let's get started

53
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.420
10 minutes in the caffeine from the first red bull permeates the bloodstream,

54
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.430
your heart rate and blood pressure.

55
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.300
Now start to rise after 15 to 45 minutes,

56
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.730
you may have better concentration or just feel more wired depending on how

57
00:03:47.731 --> 00:03:49.770
fast you down the entire camp.

58
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.930
The caffeine is completely absorbed. 30 to 50 minutes later.

59
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.710
Pupils will dilate blood pressure rises even higher.

60
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.630
And the body releases bursts of insulin with caffeine blocking the

61
00:04:03.631 --> 00:04:08.220
effects of adenosine, a necessary chemical involved in the sleep process.

62
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.530
The body kicks into full on emergency adrenaline response mode.

63
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.420
The liver dumps extra sugar into the bloodstream and it's converted into fat.

64
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.280
After one hour,

65
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.110
you may start to feel a major sugar crash and the effects of the caffeine

66
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.840
start to die down. Congratulations.

67
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.670
You just survived the first hour and there's only 30 more cans to go

68
00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:34.350
today. Not to worry.

69
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.340
You probably won't survive the entire 31 days anyway,

70
00:04:38.341 --> 00:04:43.170
because you'll likely experience a caffeine overdose in the first two weeks,

71
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.780
consider this you'll be consuming 160 milligrams of

72
00:04:48.781 --> 00:04:51.270
caffeine. Every hour you are awake.

73
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.430
That's 2,560 milligrams in 16 hours.

74
00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.680
The negative effects of caffeine would have already kicked in around the 300 to

75
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.460
500 milligram Mark to overdose on caffeine.

76
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.530
You would need to reach a 10 gram level of intake. Since one,

77
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.090
250 milliliter ran contains 80 milligrams of caffeine.

78
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.400
It would only take 125 cans of red bull to totally

79
00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:24.330
overdo it. You can also forget about that eight hours of sleep.

80
00:05:24.331 --> 00:05:27.990
We estimated with all that sugar and caffeine in your system.

81
00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.040
It's no surprise that insomnia is often a reported side effect.

82
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.900
Then there's the physical aftermath of trying such a challenge.

83
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.490
High blood pressure increase for risk of type two diabetes,

84
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.860
heart disease, kidney problems.

85
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.690
Not to mention your teeth would look disgusting from the enamel being stripped

86
00:05:48.691 --> 00:05:49.524
off.

87
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.270
It's safe to say no one should ever try to drink this many red bulls.

88
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.420
Our bodies are made to function well in this constant hyped up state of

89
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.260
fight or flight, even drinking one can of red bull,

90
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.230
probably isn't doing your body any favors,

91
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.000
but we wouldn't expect you to give up caffeine entirely.

92
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.380
Can you imagine what our world would look like if everyone stopped drinking

93
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:19.940
coffee? Well, that's a story for another. What if.
